27898:US	49600435	R33KTZR5OJSMHR	0399237224	216933900	Our Tree Named Steve	Books	5	8	16	N	N	4 1/2* The Remembrance of Trees Past,	This sometimes poignant story focuses on the long-term intersections of family life and nature (here, a tree named \\"Steve\\"), and mixes humor and pathos appropriate for toddlers to early elementary school age kids. While there are some minor flaws that a good editor might have corrected, the narrative and (especially) the illustrations tell an original story about nature's centrality in our development and our memories.<br /><br />The story line is in the form of a letter from a father to his three grown-up kids, describing how \\"a long time ago, when you were little, Mom and I took you to where we wanted to build a house for us to live in.\\" This information would be obvious and sound a little redundant if really written to three grown-up children. Although very talented, Zweibel doesn't completely resolve the difficult problem of writing a children's story through the modus operandi of a letter for grown-ups. Still, Zweibel captures the power and appeal of reminiscence as \\"Dad\\" recounts realistic details such as two-year old Sari's calling out \\"Steve\\" as a mispronunciation of Steve, and the tree's increasing importance to the entire family:<br /><br />\\"He quickly worked his way into your lives as a swing holder, target, third base, hiding place, jump-rope turner... and whenever our dryer broke down, he held our underwear with pride.\\"<br /><br />The latter phrase once again shows the primacy of the book's audience over the letter's audience--the grown-up children. While this is understandable and even laudable (shouldn't the reader come first?), it makes the letter-writing device seem a bit manipulative. Rather than being profound and transcendental, the tone seems a bit expedient and overly sentimental. This is particularly the case on the two-page spread showing Kirby the dog sniffing the stump where Steve once stood, a victim of disease and a recent storm. Against a monochromatic purple background that practically resembles the burning of Atlanta in \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" we read in Dad's letter:<br /><br />\\"...even in his final moments, when he could have fallen on our house, Sari's swings, Kirby's house, or Mom's garden, Steve performed his last trick and protected all of us to the very end, and friends like this are hard to find.\\"<br /><br />It's some 20 or so years later, and Sari's swings are still up and Dad talks to his grown-ups kids about Steve's \\"tricks\\"? This is a bit much, and seems antithetical to the book's theme of change. Furthermore, time seems to change unevenly in \\"Steve's\\" neck of the woods. Years later, the house looks much the same as it did when the family first moved there. The two older children do begin to look like teenagers, but young Sari's picture is ill-defined and static.<br /><br />Still, Zweibel touches upon important and difficult issues of discovery, change, destruction, and renewal. More impressively, he seems to have struck a chord with his adult audience about the sometimes forgotten importance of memory and personal meaning. (Read the reviews here, in which people often mention a tree or other well-loved and often used natural object from their childhood.) I also liked the conclusion in which Steve's remnants make up a new tree house in a new tree.<br /><br />Although there are the necessary comical interludes featuring the mugging dog. David Catrow's pencil and watercolor illustrations have the look of memory. In the best pictures, the foggy, muted colors recall a fondly remembered past, and some of the pictures impart a mythic stature to the beloved tree. For adults, \\"Steve\\" symbolizes a past to which we cannot fully return; for children, Steve is the embodiment of the joy, the intimacy, and the unpredictability of nature. A book with special poignancy after the recent Gulf Coast floods, its appeal seems to transcend Zweibel and Catrow's material.With The Wind,\\" we read in Dad's letter:  <br /> <br />\\"...even in his final moments, when he could have fallen on our house, Sari's swings, Kirby's house, or Mom's garden, Steve performed his last trick and protected all of us to the very end, and friends like this are hard to find.\\"  <br /> <br />It's some 20 or so years later, and Sari's swings are still up and Dad talks to his grown-ups kids about Steve's \\"tricks\\"?

While undoubtedly not Hemingway's cup of soup, his famous \\"Moveable Feast\\" title fits this dynamic children's book.  Gianna Marino, a new writer from northern California, grabs the readers attention from page one and holds you in her masterly grasp from the simple beginning to the explosive cornucopian conclusion.<br /><br />Her first children's book is an astonishing achievement, easily one of the best of the year.  It's enjoyable on many levels:  A picture book with a plot, an educational \\"ABC\\" learning piece, a showcase of illustrative and creative ingenuity, and a \\"Where's Waldo\\" searching volume all in one(without the frustration and limited mind-opening qualities of the former). (\\"Zoopa,\\" by the way, is a clever pun on the Italian \\"Zuppa\\"--soup; author Marino has an Italian background).<br /><br />It begins simply, with an ant wandering across a gingham tablecloth towards a bowl of tangy tomato soup.  (How do I know it's \\"tangy?\\" Because Marino draws and uses color so well that it LOOKS tangy!)  As the Ant approaches from one side, a Butterfly zooms down from the other, and the letters A (for ant) and B (for butterfly) appear in the soup. As more animals appear, the soup becomes increasingly alphabetized, with previously used letters receding in to the background, and new letters heralding the approach of, for example, Dogs scampering across the bottom of the tablecloth; a Frog zipping his tongue at the \\"F\\" looming large in the bowl; a decorative rim of Elephants suddenly appearing on the rim of the soup bowl, one of them knocking a big blue \\"K\\" into it; and even a Jellyfish, acting as a parachute, dropping the letter \\"J\\" to join its alphabet colleagues.<br /><br />Throughout the book, there are stories within stories, as the alphabet-representing animals interact with each other at the increasingly crowded bowl of soup--it's the soupy equivalent of the Marx Brothers' \\"Stateroom Scene.\\" The frog and ant play in an ongoing \\"cat and mouse\\" game, the dogs and elephants cavort amongst themselves, and the hedgehog decides to take a few laps in the soup!<br /><br />Ms. Marino introduces the animals and their corresponding letters very creatively. Along with the jellyfish-parachuted \\"J,\\" a unicorn (U), magically appears on the soup spoon, a bunch of cute pigs (P) come to life on the napkin, and the ultimate Zebra (Z) comes bursting--all excitement and piZZaZZ--out of the center of the bowl!  Some of the animals are difficult to find, which is a lot of the fun for both kids and adults.  Moreover, some of them are a bit obscure. I was hoping there might be some information about the animals' identity at the back of the book. My hopes were answered:  Ms. Marino wisely has a legend that identifies the Quail, the Nanny Goat, the difficult-to-find Jellyfish, and the regrettably obscure (for Xenops fans) bird, the Xenops.  (This is one book where \\"xylophone\\" will NOT do as the \\"X\\" word!).<br /><br />Although the little scene is FULL of animals by the end of the alphabet, Marino introduces new ones no more than three at a time, and you can follow the eyes of some of the animals to spot the new ones.  In addition, the new arrivals are often larger, or contrast in some other manner with the older soup aficionados. Still, the sometime-confusion is challenging and definitely part of the fun, placing this book within a very wide target audience range.  Marino's accurate but very expressive animals and soup setting are illustrated in gouache, and she nicely rounds and draws the potentially very static soup bowl and accompaniments in a style that recalls 1930's-40's animation.<br /><br />This is a singular achievement, and a triumphant realization of a challenging idea.  While there are simpler books on the alphabet, this book not only introduces the letters, but also entertains and stimulates readers of all ages. At this price, this superb book should be on many, many gift giving lists this season!  Exceptionally good and very highly recommended!	2005-09-28

Here she explores the rivalry between an insect (who's simply the bee's knees) and his honey of a newborn sister, who quickly and inadvertently wins the heart of the hive. Listen to Hazen's economical, humorous development of character and plot in the opening:<br /><br />\\"Buzz Bumble was a medium sized bee, but he could fly fast, dance the bee dance, and buzz and tumble with gusto.  All the bees admired his talents.<br />`Look at Buzz fly!' gasped Humble Bumble.<br />`That Buzz sure can bring home the nectar,' said Senor Sting.<br />`I hope Ansel Antennae features Buzz in the next National Bee-Graphic,' Ms. Bizzy said.\\"<br /><br />Hazen adds other memorable phrases that should appeal to both children and adults.  For example, Buzz Bumble is not just a happy bee; rather, his \\"wings vibrated with joy.\\"  Little Baby Bumble isn't just a cuddle-bug; \\"She's sweeter than all the nectar in the garden.\\" Alliterative phrases and a glancing reference to Buzz landing on his \\"bumble bum\\" add to the fun.<br /><br />Buzz doesn't like all this fawning over his new little sister (\\"Why were they droning on and on about her?\\"), especially when it takes so much time to teach her the a, b, c' s of being a bee, and Ansel Antennae is about to land!  Tears flow from Buzz's eyes: \\"'No one cares about me anymore,' he sighed.\\" With ease and humor, Ms. Hazen portrays some of the deep feelings engendered by the arrival of a new brother or sister.  She also shows a way out of these complicated feelings. When Baby Bumble falls into an insect-eating flower, Buzz heroically (ok, and maybe not very realistically) holds open the dangerous flower so that Baby can escape.  Not only do the siblings share their newfound feelings by rubbing each other's antennae, but bearded, bald Ansel--looking like a BEEtnik at a freaky costume party--gets the action on film. When they both appear on the cover of National Bee-graphic, brother and sister share the spotlight together.<br /><br />Jill Newton fills the pages with big petals of highlighted color and some subtle texture. You can almost smell the ripe sweet flowers in mauves and purples against a brilliantly blue rococo sky. The facial expressions are easily recognizable and don't minimize the hurt felt by Buzz. I did find the yellowish-green \\"skin\\" tone of one bee, \\"Humble Bumble\\" somewhat unpleasant, and the intense colors make the book somewhat more suitable for large room rather than intimate reading settings. There's also a puzzling discontinuity between one line of text and the illustrations.  We're told that \\"when Buzz flew in for a dramatic finish...he got bumped out...\\"  Bumped out of what?  Perhaps the flower patch because Baby and her admirers were crowding it?  It's difficult to say because the illustration doesn't show the action.<br /><br />Hazen and Newton show the climactic rescue in a dramatic,  potentially scary scene: We see \\"Baby\\" inside the hungry flower, and the text reads, \\"No one knew what to do. It was too horrible to watch.\\"  However, the happy resolution comes quickly and the outcome is never really in doubt.  The rescue adds excitement and emotion to what could have been an overly sweet or preachy \\"lesson\\" about getting along with the family newBEE. (I should warn you that this book may inspire punning.)  Overall, another excellent book by Ms. Hazen([...] a talented and entertaining writer who respects the intelligence and psychology of her audience.<br /><br />NOTE: As mentioned above, Ms. Hazen is among the students, alumnae, and faculty at Vermont College, a coterie that includes the outstanding work of such current students as Lynn Hazen, Karen Ehrhardt (her wonderful \\"This Jazz Man\\" is due out in April, 2006), Ed Briant, Jane Buchanan, Liza Donnelly, Hatsy McGraw, BarbaraSantucci, Jennifer Gennari Shepherd; alumni Lynn Hazen, Ren&eacute; Colato-Lainez, Mindy Hardwick, Helen Hemphill, Kim Justesen, Judith Kuns, Jane Legrow, Joann Early Macken, Carolyn Marsden, Carmela Martino, Lauren Myracle, Shenaaz Nanji, Candice Ransome, Anita Riggio, Mary Ann Rodman, April Pulley, Leda Schubert, Ann Teplick, Beckie Weinheimer, Deborah Wiles, and Gretchen Woelfle; and faculty members Tobin Anderson, Kathi Appelt, Marion Dane Bauer, Margaret Bechard, Ronald Koertge, Ellen Levine, Tim Wynne Jones, and Liza Ketchum.ené Colato-Lainez, Mindy Hardwick, Helen Hemphill, Kim Justesen, Judith Kuns, Jane Legrow, Joann Early Macken, Carolyn Marsden, Carmela Martino, Lauren Myracle, Shenaaz Nanji, Candice Ransome, Anita Riggio, Mary Ann Rodman, April Pulley, Leda Schubert, Ann Teplick, Beckie Weinheimer, Deborah Wiles, and Gretchen Woelfle; and faculty members Tobin Anderson, Kathi Appelt, Marion Dane Bauer, Margaret Bechard, Ronald Koertge, Ellen Levine, Tim Wynne Jones, and Liza Ketchum.	2005-09-26

It's a realistic but humorous look at how fights can begin, and shows some examples of how they can be resolved. In the opening story, Annie complains loudly and dramatically about her older sister's attempts at cooking:  The blue cheese smells terrible, there's too much milk in her cereal, and the raisins probably have pits in them, and, most horrid, of all, the peas have rolled against her omelet!  \\"'Oh no!' Sophie yelled. `The peas are TOUCHING the eggs! Don't let them touch!'\\" Annie tries to help by separating them with some French bread, but Sophie, not surprisingly, hates French bread, and in her disgust she knocks everything over. Author Deborah Blumenthal draws a perfect word picture of the yucky results: \\"'Eeeeeeewww,' Sophie said, as a pea-juice puddle drowned the bread, turning it green and soggy, floating all the food together.\\"<br /><br />Blumenthal excels at portraying the sudden emotional shifts in the family, from unsteady calm to explosive conflict, and eventually to joyful resolution. The stories show that fights can be intentional or arise from misunderstandings, that feelings can be conveyed loudly or held privately, and that age differences bring real problems as well as opportunities to learn. Although the book optimistically resolves these issues-though not without hurt and irritation-it conveys that they're an ongoing and normal part of growing up in a family.<br /><br />Timothy Basil Ering's buoyant illustrations suggest a variety of playful styles, including childlike scrawls and exaggerated lines, the exaggerated emotions of the Expressionists, and the abstract forms and unconventional colors of the Fauves (e.g., Wassily Kandinsky). Ering is a talented artist whose drawings (in graphite and grease pencils, pen and ink, and acrylics) switch from the ultra-conventional(some of his backgrounds look like flat \\"paint-by-number\\" compositions) to the wildly imaginative.<br /><br />Most families will recognize the dynamics here, and the stories and pictures are fun and engaging whether one takes away a \\"lesson\\" or not. Besides the cooking story, there's a story about the sisters' temperamental differences, and the issues of sharing and trust.  This last story is quieter and more introspective than the preceding ones; I think Blumenthal and Ering may have thought, rather wisely, that a gentler concluding story would be more appropriate for a listener about to drift off to sleep. This is a fun story collection united by a common theme, unusually expressive illustrations, and a superb overall design.mber\\" compositions) to the wildly imaginative. <br /> <br />Most families will recognize the dynamics here, and the stories and pictures are fun and engaging whether one takes away a \\"lesson\\" or not.

The book covers an interesting side story to the Titanic's 1912 sinking, in which over 1500 people were killed out of a total of over 2,200.  How do you write about such a tragedy for children?<br /><br />Author Crew tells the story through the first person narrative of a toy musical pig, named \\"Maxixe\\" by her owner,  passenger Edith Rosenbaum. At first, I thought it was a real pig. My confusion is echoed in the book, where the toy pig is mistaken for a baby by one of the sailors rescuing the passengers.  HE throws the pig into a lifeboat, and Rosenbaum follows, both toy pig and owner survive.  The highpoint of the story is the pig's musical comforting of the frightened children who are also in the lifeboat:<br /><br />\\"...THE children, they are so cold and frightened. They need your help. If I wind up your tail, can you still play your song?\\"<br />\\"Oui oui!  It's me , Maxixe. Of course I can play. So Edith wound up my tail. Round and round it went...First I saw a little smile.  Then I heard a giggle. My song had made the children laugh!\\"<br /><br />Edith and the children are shown leaving the rescue ship with big smiles on their faces, due to Maxixe playing music for them all night long.  While the author duly notes (in a small-fonted \\"author's note\\" after the story)  the casualties, especially in families (and sometimes as a result of a chosen sacrifice), there is an incongruity between the pig's narrative and the scope of the tragedy. Bruce Whatley's magnificent illustrations  include some frightened and sad faces, symbols of the larger and more pervasive emotions on the sinking ship. However, the text seems entirely too matter-of-fact about the disaster.<br /><br />It's difficult to produce non-sentimental and sufficiently realistic description of the tragedy without overwhelming the young audience. The book mostly succeeds, chiefly through illustrator Whatley's close-ups, but the story doesn't seem to capture the enormity of the disaster, and the \\"happy\\" scene depicted on the last page is especially off base.  Still, this is a daring and original attempt at telling the Titanic story for youngsters. The pig-point-of-view, the richly-colored pictures of the Titanic as it sails, the darkened, dramatic close-ups as it sinks (children are spared the sight of the ship actually going down), and the \\"author's note\\" --for those old enough to read it--make this an appropriate starting point for talks about tragedy and smalls acts of comfort and heroism.  It's too bad that the publishers don't show very much in the \\"look inside this book\\" feature on this page, it would help give potential buyers a much better idea of whether this story is ok for the intended audience.capture the enormity of the disaster, and the \\"happy\\" scene depicted on the last page is especially off base.

Wolfe is clever, and he gives us some scathing commentary on American culture.  However, the book has two major problems:  First, he oversimplifies his targets. Second, there's a mean streak that strikes one as the curmudgeonly rantings of a man fully rooted in a mythical American past.<br /><br />It's easy for Wolfe to make fun of trends in psychology, sociobiology, linguistics, and \\"cultural relativity\\" when he puts them through a definitional strainer so thin that only the barest outline of the original theory remains.  Yet, that's what Wolfe does as he dumbs them down, and then calls them bogus.  It's dishonest criticism. He oversimplifies deconstructionism, psychoanalysis, biology, multiculturalism, and other topics so much that I continually reacted along the lines of \\"But that's not what those theories say!\\"  Additionally, as another reviewer mentioned, his objections are neither original nor aware of recent modifications.  However much one detests deconstruction (which he derides as some sort of new Communism), his simplistic approach is not only unfair, but ignores the ways in which it has influenced other political, linguistic, and social \\"discourse.\\"  Wolff seems such a Francophobe that one imagines him ordering \\"Freedom Fries\\" to this day. In addition, Wolfe himself has a long and noble history of deconstructing \\"texts,\\" including his own re-workings of the \\"New Yorker\\" in two essays here.<br /><br />For a man who seems to reject the post-modern idea that \\"history is written by the winners,\\" Wolfe spends an inordinate amount of time protecting and promoting his reputation. His reaction to critiques by Mailer, Updike, and Irving, although some of it deserving, comes off as incredibly puerile, and he proclaims that his naturalist reportage (as opposed to their brand of writing) is the style and model for the new century.  (At least, he credits Zola, Dreiser and others for their work.)  As he gleefully attempts to wittily bring down these \\"Eastern establishment\\" literary emblems; one thinks he doth protest too much.  His early pieces on \\"The New Yorker\\" are sometimes clever and quite nuanced, but he spoils the effect by telling us how clever and nuanced these were.  After reading Wolfe's enthusiasm for his own work, the pieces no longer meet our heightened expectations.<br /><br />The title piece on youthful sexual practices is well written, but neither very insightful nor particularly useful:  Wolfe has a knack for the revealing quote and the economical vignette, but whether these are true or representative is hard to know. At least \\"Hooking Up\\" is interesting and provocative without the defensive or self-promotional aspects of some of his other essays.  He also writes some interesting pieces about technology and society, although again, his speculations about the future are just too easy for him to knock down.  The essays are so scattered and varied that his sarcasm, exaggeration, and critical satire are often indistinguishable from his own vaunted objective \\"naturalistic\\" reporting.  Is he putting us on, or has he really become such a social science \\"Luddite\\" and prude? (I suspect the latter, but maybe, David Bowie-like, his newfound crank-stance is just a temporary persona.)  The man who dislikes notions of relativity and subjectivism doesn't appear to recognize that he himself reports the \\"facts\\" from a highly subjective and rightward leaning political ground.  Unfortunately, the stream of cheap attacks on the perceived European/leftist/academic intellectual complex drowns out much of the less biased and more genuinely insightful criticism found here.alist reportage (as opposed to their brand of writing) is the style and model for the new century.

Here, there's no fishing or hunting, but you follow the same trail past Chimney and Courthouse Rock, ford a river, climb the Rockies, and raft down the Columbia River to Oregon. Although I wondered the book violated any copyright laws, all resemblance to the \\"Oregon Trail\\" ends there.<br /><br />Unlike the game, there's no dysentery, crooked traders, stampeding animals, or cranky settlers. Instead, a plucky family travels from Iowa to Oregon with a gigantic wagon holding a holding a whole orchard of fruit trees: Apples, plums, cherries, pears, and peaches.  The book is more enjoyable than I expected, given its resemblance to the game, mostly because of the colorful girl, \\"Delicious,\\" who narrates the story, and the sometimes silly obsession of her fruit-minded father. When \\"Delicious\\" (at least her father didn't name her \\"Gravenstein\\") alerts us \\"Daddy was ready for the most daring adventure in the history of fruit,\\" you know you're in for a clever and exciting tall tale.<br /><br />On the way to Oregon, the family encounters nasty skeptical fellow travelers, weather changes, and natural obstacles.  They build a raft and start paddling the Platte River, the \\"muddy drink started to pull us down\\":<br /><br />\\"'The peaches are plummeting!' my sisters shouted.\\"<br /><br />\\"'The plums are plunging,' boomed my brother.\\"<br /><br />\\"'Don't let my babies go belly-up!\\" howled Daddy.<br /><br />Apparently, Daddy's has unbounded concern for the apples of his eye...and he also loves his kids. Delicious, who knows that children raised on apples are \\"mighty strong\\" (there's lots of \\"Western\\" dialect festooning these pages), gets her sibs to kick off their shoes and kick their feet against the Platte.  Later, a windstorm strikes, half-denuding the family (sure to get some laughs from the younger set), and eliciting another cry from Daddy (always in big, bold font):<br /><br />\\"Guard the grapes! Protect the peaches!\\"<br /><br />The persistent, albeit slightly goofy Daddy, is shown on a great two-page spread  resembling the Disneyland diorama of the Grand Canyon.  The family is hauling the wagon up about a 50 degree incline, an impossible task, of course, while the unvanquished Daddy announces, \\"just a hundred miles to go.\\"  In one of many colorful illustrations, Delicious-looking more and more like a young pioneer woman, fights a wispy Jack Frost with a bonfire and a blanket. Very soon, \\"that low-down scoundrel was hightailing it out of there, heading straight for Walla, Washington. Delicious stands tall and proud. The illustrations slightly recall those of Patricia Polacco with their emphasis on people's faces and long exaggerated lines, although they're not quite as loopy and personal as Polacco's.<br /><br />The books concludes with a successful orchard planting in Oregon, just as in the true story of the parents and their eight children who brought the first apple trees from Iowa to Oregon in 1847.  Delicious, easily the most appealing and emotionally satisfying character in the book is last seen high up in an apple tree, munching away and pondering the Gold Rush that that began shortly after their trip.

Monsieur Saguette, with a stereotypical beret on his head and a kerchief embracing his neck, decides that he needs some bread to go with his pot of soup.  Zuts alors! He is out of bread, so he walks to the local boulangerie (bakery) to buy a baguette (a long, crusty loaf of bread often known in America as \\"French bread\\").  The adventure really begins on the way home, as he wields his baguette to rescue a number of daunting situations.  The premise is interesting, and Mr. Asch uses a palette of nicely soft colors (created using Photoshop software), but the book's details set a tone that doesn't fit the otherwise gentle trappings of this book for toddlers and early grade- schoolers.<br /><br />The dissonance begins with the first encounter.  A little girl is crying because her cat is stuck in a tree. However, her face isn't just sad, but angry as well, and the story doesn't suggest this feeling.  With her puddles of tears and downward pointing eyebrows, it almost looks like an act, as if she hoisted (by its petard or something) the cat into the tree.  Saguette uses the baguette as a ladder to reach the cat.  If this sounds like quibbling, the next scene may convince you that Asch wasn't thinking enough of his potential audience.<br /><br />\\"As Monsieur Saguette continued on his way home he came upon a chilling sight.  An alligator has escaped from the zoo and is about to eat a baby... \\"Help! Help!\\" cried the baby's mother.\\"<br /><br />A confused baby sits in the middle of the street near an overturned buggy (an allusion to \\"Potempkin,\\" anyone?) as a very large alligator with huge sharp teeth walks right up to it.  The mother throws up her hands and screams.  This is a very unsettling picture.  OF course, Saguette props open the gator's mouth with the baguette, and all is well again.  The baguette must be especially crusty because it is still firm enough to convince a robber on the Parisian quay (dock) that a gun is lodged in his back. The robber (who, by the way, is holding a real gun)  begs \\"Please don't shoot...  \\"I give up!\\" A gendarme takes the gun, and the robber, in a genuinely amusing throwaway says \\"I want to talk to my lawyer.\\"  In another not-quite-right scene, a marching band is not marching; instead, various musicians are playing games, holding hands, petting a dog, and generally looking as if they are relieved that they are not marching.  Saguette asks somewhat incongruously, \\"What's the problem?\\"  The bandleader has inexplicably lost his baton, but the baguette keeps time just as well.  The parade resumes, and the musicians look just as pleasantly diverted as when they were on an unplanned break. These unvarying emotions are simply too facile.<br /><br />Monsieur Saguette finally arrives at his little home (strange that this section of Paris is so rural looking) and thoroughly enjoys his lunch.  He even throws the crumbs out the window for les petites oiseaux (birds) to enjoy. I would have liked that spirit throughout the book. Asch is obviously a skilled artist and storyteller, the pace is well measured, the simple story says much about imagination and creativity, and the colors are very pleasant. However, the few slips described here quickly decreased its appeal.

Only the most talented authors and illustrators can successfully translate film genres into books for kids. Film noir is a recent favorite, but the styles and dialogues of early animated fairy tales and \\"Bowery Boy\\" films have also been emulated with mixed results. It's an alluring but tricky task, because the book must strike adults as reasonably authentic by retaining some of the original elements, while still appealing to the young--most of whom have no idea of the progenitor.<br /><br />This book is an exceptionally well illustrated foray into 1930's screwball comedies.  The setting and characters look like they come from that era, and the insouciant plot reminds one of the intelligent yet zany--hence \\"screwball\\"--comedies perfected decades ago.  The book's closest model would be a Preston Sturges comedy (e.g., \\"The Lady Eve,\\" \\"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek,\\" ) noted for clever dialogue, likeable characters,  and improbable plots. The current book is all about our crimped-hair heroine's quest for a bowl of stew from the corner restaurant.  That's the entire plot.  However, authors Laura Numeroff (\\"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\\"), Barry Saltzberg, and, especially, illustrator Salvatore Murdocca turn this thin storyline into a dazzling Broadway production. Even the details show originality and attention to characterization: The rhyming dialogue between the woman and the restaurant host, for example, are set in different fonts:  The woman's font, much like the woman, is direct, slender, and tall; the host's is a solicitous and evasive italic. (Unfortunately, the font won't reproduce here.)<br /><br />I'll bring you a menu,<br />In a minute or two.<br /><br />No need to bother.<br />We came for the stew.<br /><br />There is no more stew,<br />I'm sorry to say.<br />We do have some noodles,<br />Will that be okay?<br /><br />No, thank you, kind sir,<br />We never touch noodles.<br />They're messy to eat,<br />And not fit for poodles.<br /><br />This last rhyme shows a picture of the woman's enormously furry poodle slurping noodles and tossing them about the cafe. This must be the fantasy sequence of the movie/book, for the woman clearly replies that neither she nor her poodle would consume a noodle.  As the woman and dog peruse the menu while the elusive stew arrives at someone else's table, a picture window reveals tall buildings swaying, like the energized objects in a Disney picture. In the book's second fantasy sequence, a two page spread (replicated on the cover of the book) shows a Busby Berkeley melange of singer and dancing waiters and the woman and poodle flying against a lit up sky, with a Gotham city skyline, a giant oven with stew pot, and an airplane (trailing behind it a banner proclaiming \\"WONDERFUL STEW\\") in the background.  It's a satire, just as \\"42nd Street\\" parodied itself, and it's one of the most magical and imaginative pictures I've seen in a kid's book.  Although a few of the pictures aren't quite as glorious, most of the illustrations display Murdocca's shimmering palette, especially his blues and golds. His colors look like saturated tints, and his shadings (e.g., the tablecloths, the awnings) are luminous and sophisticated.<br /><br />As it happens, the chef can't make more stew; it's actually made by the mother of the cafe host (this is definitely a Jimmy Stewart role). Jean Arthur (she'd fit, or perhaps Hepburn) and Jimmy ride on his motorcycle to grandmother's, only to find that she's just driven off for bowling. With the poodle in the sidecar, the two inevitable young lovers hop on the cyle and follow grandma as somewhat more modern-looking pedestrians point the way.  The time machine effect is one of the protagonists living in their own screwball comedy of dawning love, surrounded by obliging but otherwise naiive modern-day urbanites...

Prolific author/illustrator Cynthia Rylant addresses the \\"choosing\\" aspect of friendships in this humorous book about a bookstore owner and her dog, \\"Martha Jane.\\"<br /><br />The unnamed owner and her dog are inseparable; the human even names her store \\"Martha Jane's Bookshop.\\"  New customers assume that this is the owner's name, and when they ask to speak with her, they find themselves shaking hands with a dog!  After this setup, Rylant introduces us to the popular dog's many friends: The green-coated man who feeds and pets her, and the postman, the policeman, and the band director who each teach Martha a trick related to their own profession.  (For example, \\"the postman taught Martha Jane how to fetch the mail.\\")<br /><br />One day, however, the bookshop owner must go to the hospital to have her tonsils removed.  There's a dilemma--whom she choose to dog sit Martha Jane?  The loveable dog has plenty of suitors: The policeman, the postman, the band director, and several children compete for dog sitting honors.  In fact, \\"things get a little nasty.\\"<br /><br />\\"The policeman told the postman to take his junk mail and stuff it down his pants.  The postman told the band director to go blow his horn.  The band director blew his horn in the policeman's ear.  And some of the children swatted each other with their bags of kibble.\\"<br /><br />Rylant seems to say that some people go a bit too far to \\"win\\" a friendship.  However, when the green-coated man comes to Martha Jane with food, affection, and kind words, Martha makes up her mind. The book closes happily:  The townspeople make up, the bookshop owner and the green-coated man get married, and Martha Jones (looking slightly scared) surfs the waves on the post-wedding trip to Hawaii!  While things are tied up somewhat too neatly, the narrative shows that the most unselfish and least self-centered person was the person Martha Jane trusted enough to take care of her.  An alternative conclusion (maybe a better one) might have skipped the quick marriage, and pointed out how a loveable dog (or boy or girl) can have many friends along with those few he or she trusts the most.  Still, the book has its own sweet logic, some funny moments born of confusion and conflict, and it conveys the close bond between people and their pets.  Rylant's vividly colored illustrations are inviting, and the childlike forms framed by bright designs make this an informal, welcoming book.ntered person was the person Martha Jane trusted enough to take care of her.

I've seen tall buildings before, I've seen crowded urban areas before, and I've even seen NYC before...though only in the movies.  There is nothing quite like it, and there really is a electric feeling of energy, combined with architectural wonders, street vendors, Central Park (along with great baseball fans, and very friendly people).<br /><br />I mention all this becasue \\"My New York\\" is an eye-popping, dazzling work that reaches out to you like your first ice cream sundae. At the bottom of each page, Kathy Jacobsen describes (through her narrator, \\"Becky\\") the sometimes majestic scenes that she experienced in her eight year stay in the city.  The book focuses on Manhattan, fans of Brooklyn and Queens, etc. might feel slighted. Her elaborate, often densely populated pictures include the public library (the one picture where she errs--see below), the zoo on Fifth Avenue and 64th street (there's a nice map of Manhattan in the beginning),  an intimate view of the D'Aluto cheesecake store, the underbelly of the aircraft carrier, \\"Intrepid,\\" a three-panel foldout of the Empire State Building, with a similarly sized view from the top of the building on the opposite side!<br /><br />Like a Florence Ziegfield show, the can-you-top-this pictures (and the nicely-pitched descriptions) don't let up. There's the inside of the FAO Schwarz toy store, three or four stories showing on one page! Th Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.  bird's-eye view of July 4th fireworks exploding over the tall ships and the Manhattan skyline, Central Park, dinosaurs in the atural History Museum, the MET, the Apollo Theater in Harlem (advertising \\"Amateur Niht\\"), a nighttime parade in Chinatown, and, of course, RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL and the ROCKETTES doing a Christmas program! Yet there's more, including the Macy's parade, the New Year's Eve ball dropping in Times Square, and games and facts at the conclusion.  The book seems longer than it is because of the exciting, detailed pictures--it's almost too much to read at one time.<br /><br />I agree that the book has too many sly references to friends and who-knows-what other allusions to things that Ms. Jacobsen enjoys or wants to promote.  While this is somewhat of a tradition in kids' books, she really overdoes it here. Yet this is a problem only on the opening spread showing the New York Public Library; elsewhere the references are either more subdued or more publicly known. The Public Library spread is annoying also because she includes some very vague-looking drawings of celebrities, whom you can try to locate if you choose. Still, the excessive nature of this scene is easily overlooked given the talent and energy that Ms. Jacobsen brings to the rest of the book.<br /><br />\\"My New York is very attractively priced as of this date, and the varied references (sigh--but no Yankee Stadium) will appeal to kids with different interests.  Also, I don't think the pictures are in the \\"folk art\\" style; the shadings, contrasts, and slightly loopy drawings of people (think \\"Nancy\\" or \\"Little Orphan Annie\\") evince more of a very early comic strip sensibility.

Very few authors have Donald Crews' ability to make a linear story so interesting and abstract.  As in \\"Sail Away\\" and many other books, Crews places enough twists and turns into his straightforward story to make it interesting and imaginative.  This story, stripped to its essentials, is about people, animals, and machinery parading down a street.  There are very few words, and the action is in strict chronological order.  Crews turns his genius upon this simple premise, and delivers an extraordinarily clever book.<br /><br />The festivities begin at dawn with a street cleaner lighting a sign that announces there is no parking today because of a parade. Other preparations begin, illustrated by spare drawings.<br /><br />\\"Buttons,<br /><br />balloons,<br /><br />and flags for sale.<br /><br />Hot dogs,<br /><br />pretzels,<br /><br />ice cream,<br /><br />and soda<br /><br />to buy.\\"<br /><br />Next is a two-page spread with three words (\\"A crowd. Waiting.\\"), and lines of people on either side of the street; it's a daring move that works because of the illustration. Crews' bold graphic style emphasizing color and shape rather than detail, although he's able to vary the shapes, poses, and attitudes of the crowd.<br /><br />Another two-page spread (\\"Here it comes!\\"), and the big, splashy parade begins!  We never know exactly what the parade is about (it concerns travel), but as the procession marches past our eyes, we see flags of many nations, a \\"strutting drum major\\" followed by wind instruments and percussion, floats (including a ship-a pun on \\"Crews?\\"), green and pink baton twirlers, vintage bicycles, autos,  and a brand new fire engine.  You can feel the crowd's anticipation and excitement-taking pictures, pointing, climbing on parental backs for a better view, and throwing confetti at the fire engine.<br /><br />In yet another winning touch, Crews shows what happens when the parade is over, and the people have scattered: A street cleaner ends the parade just as it had started it.  Another superior work by Crews for the toddler crowd, and another triumph for Greenwillow publishing.  (This review refers to the \\"library edition.\\")  Obviously, it's recommended highly!it.

Johnson's brilliant series that combines post-impressionist art and 19th century American transcendental philosophy.  The idea itself is imaginative, and Johnson once again pursues it with humor, historical accuracy, and astonishing illustrations-among the best I have seen in books for kids.<br /><br />The protagonist is Henry Bear, a secure individualist (with a strong communal spirit) who emulates the teachings of his famous namesake--Henry David Thoreau. When he chances upon Henry digging up a comfrey root by the pond,  his buddy Channing invites him to go fishing, but Henry demurs: \\"'Not today...I'm walking to work.' Henry puts the comfrey root in his hat and walks down the path.\\"  Henry, as we know from previous books, likes to take his time and soak up the nature he sees everywhere around him.  He climbs a tall hill and observes the clouds' promise of rain, then waters some milkweed flowers, and picks up some pine.  At Mrs. Hosmer's  (who, once again, looks a lot like a bearish Whistler's mother) Henry leaves some pine by her window, and in town he gives the postmaster some comfrey for his sore foot.  The postmaster asks him, \\"Since you're not working, can you take this letter to Emerson?\\"  Henry keeps doing his favors, big and small, as he walks to Mr. Emerson's, Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne, and Mrs. Alcott's.  (D. B. Johnson's literary allusions keep the book interesting for adults without interrupting the flow for kids).  Henry keeps walking through the forest and the mill river, picking berries, helping neighbors, and insisting that he isn't working.  SPOILER AHEAD:  Finally, the puzzled Channing asked him what his work is.  Like Thoreau, Henry is a writer, and, also like Thoreau his work begins when he recounts the day's events on paper:  \\"'Today,' he writes, `I took a walk in the woods.'\\"  A very good one-page biography of Thoreau closes the book.<br /><br />The excellent narrative is only part of the book's appeal. D. B. Johnson's ink and colored pencil illustrations play with perspective, showing multiple angles at the same time.  His beautifully colored drawings have elements of cubism and the nature studies of Rousseau and Gauguin. One can also see hints of Cezanne and \\"folk artists\\" such as Grandma Moses.  As with his story, however, his unique and technically sophisticated style doesn't interfere with understanding and enjoying the plot.  If anything, the style is not as overtly cubist as in \\"Henry Hikes to Fitchburg,\\" and he accompanies the stylized drawings with small, simple, black and white pictures of Henry.  Though not as dazzling as `Fitchburg,' \\"Henry Works\\" can probably reach a younger age range.  Another piece de resistance from Johnson; this is one of those great books that children and adults alike will treasure.nson's ink and colored pencil illustrations play with perspective, showing multiple angles at the same time.

Books	5	5	5	N	N	There Was An Old Man From Nantucket	Valerie Fisher's unique illustrations highlight this brief collection of limericks by Edward Lear. Her style recalls late Victorian-era theatrical productions (think of the \\"Peter Pan\\" staging in the recent Depp/Winslett movie, \\"Neverland\\") fused with derivatives found in Monty Python and \\"Yellow Submarine.\\"  As in these settings, Fisher juxtaposes the human and the mannequin, the ordinary and the surrealistic, the natural and the mechanical.  All of this plays wonderfully against Lear's tightly structured 4-line poems in which the first, second, and fourth lines rhyme with each other (the last line usually through a repetition of the word in the first line), and the third line rhymes with itself:<br /><br />There was an old man of Dunluce,<br /><br />Who went out to sea on a goose:<br /><br />When he'd gone out a mile, he observ'd with a smile,<br /><br />`It is time to return to Dunluce.'<br /><br />While the poem doesn't dazzle, Fisher's accompanying picture does. She sets rows of blue-striped waves against each other, each topped with crashing wave spirals. The plainly drawn \\"old man\\" sports a modest two-piece striped bathing suit and a curling moustache that echoes the waves. She captures the era masterfully with these two elements, then adds details.  A wooden sign reading \\"N. Ireland\\" places the action, and she includes textbooky line drawings of assorted fish and turtles.  For fun, she plops in a bright plastic crab, and its kitschy modernism sets off the overall Victorian aesthetic. The waves and sea creatures look rigged with wire and ready to move, waiting only for the pull of a stagehand.<br /><br />Fisher's work is consistently imaginative, although she slips at times.  A picture of owls taught to sip tea instead of eating mice might have shown a happy mouse scampering away.  An \\"uncommonly thin\\" man who is accidentally baked seems an oddly violent choice, perhaps more so because he is from Berlin (pre-WWII, I know, but still...).  In any event, the illustrations are very kid friendly; she defines unfamiliar words (as in the following limerick) within the picture opposite the poem.<br /><br />There was an old man on the Border,<br /><br />Who lived in the utmost disorder;<br /><br />He danced with the cat, and made tea in his hat,<br /><br />Which vexed all the folks on the Border.<br /><br />The picture shows a red and purple dressed man with a cat on his arm, two plastic lizards, two \\"vexed\\" neighbors (drawn in an unfocused fun-house manner), and an unscrolled fortune-cookie paper that reads: \\"*vexed* annoyed and irritated.\\"  The book contains 15 of these mini-dramas, and Fisher's fancy is equal to Lear's.  There's a brief biography of Lear, and a map of Europe showing where the limericks take place.  This playful, cleverly illustrated celebration of Lear's \\"nonsense poetry\\" is appropriate for all ages, perhaps especially for kids in elementary school.ions are very kid friendly; she defines unfamiliar words (as in the following limerick) within the picture opposite the poem.  <br /> <br />There was an old man on the Border, <br />Who lived in the utmost disorder; <br />He danced with the cat, and made tea in his hat, <br />Which vexed all the folks on the Border. <br /> <br />The picture shows a red and purple dressed man with a cat on his arm, two plastic lizards, two \\"vexed\\" neighbors (drawn in an unfocused fun-house manner), and an unscrolled fortune-cookie paper that reads: \\"*vexed* annoyed and irritated.\\"  The book contains 15 of these mini-dramas, and Fisher's fancy is equal to Lear's.

A group of coyotes wearing bright Hawaiian shirts (and a non-conformist in plaid) satisfy their mathematical and gustatory appetites in this clever \\"Mathstart\\" series book (Level 2; ages 6 and up).  The Coyotes -- Clever, Cool, Careful, Clumsy, and young Little One--look out over the desert from the porch of their ranch.  There are roadrunners everywhere, but no subpoenas. (The book judiciously omits crates labeled \\"ACME\\" label, or coyotes named \\"Wile E.\\")  \\"'There must be hundreds of them!' said Cool Coyote.\\" The coyotes separate to verify this, but Clever Coyote (after failing to catch a running roadrunner) claims, \\"I bet I can do it in my head and come really close.\\"  When Clever Coyote rounds the individual number counts to the nearest ten and adds them, his estimate is only two more than the actual count.  In similar fashion, the coyotes compare their counts and rounded estimates of tasty grasshoppers and zebra-tailed lizards.<br /><br />Steve Bjorkman paints his desert with soft shades of purple and dotted browns.  Large green cacti break up this landscape, and the Hawaiian-shirted coyotes (wearing shades, sipping lemonade, chasing prey) give a playful air to the rounding lesson.  Bjorkman's splashy, colorful style extends to the lizards, one of which peers at the reader from the bottom of the page. There's one very annoying discontinuity; however, and it's not possible to tell whether this is due to the illustrator, author, and/or publisher. On pp.14-15, Clever Coyote comments (about the lizards): \\"There can't be that many\\" and \\"Why don't you count them and see?\\" However, Clever Coyote is not pictured on the 2-page spread.  One could also quibble over the implication that the coyotes' rounding is faster than adding.  The book doesn't really compare adding rounded versus unrounded numbers, nor does it compare counting vs. estimating.  As set up here, the coyotes' exact counts precede the rounding estimate; apparently, methods of estimating are beyond the book's scope.<br /><br />Still, author Stuart J. Murphy presents the general topic clearly and in an entertaining manner. He gives the animals human personalities, while retaining--at least in Clever Coyote-their animal habits. On each spread, Murphy includes \\"factoids,\\" information about coyotes and the desert environment (e.g., \\"Factoid: Roadrunners can fly, but they usually run.  They can go as fast as 25 miles an hour.\\") These facts could lead to some interesting discussions about biomes, food chains, etc. The last two pages restate the rounding rules (\\"numbers that end in 5 or higher should be rounded up), and present several school and home activities to reinforce the concept.ook's scope. <br /> <br />Still, author Stuart J.

In the best of all scenarios, he'd combined his two loves and have a blue dog! The color blue is easy. Bertie has a blue sweater, blue shoes, and a blue collar.  Blue dogs are at all not easy. In fact, getting a dog of any color is not easy, so Bertie just pretends he has one.<br /><br />As nimble and imaginative a toddler as you'll meet, Bertie walks and feeds his dog, and \\"he threw a stick for his pretend blue dog. But pretend dogs don't fetch sticks. So Bertie fetched the stick himself.\\"  He also scratches, sniffs, and chases his tail as a blue dog would. Polly Dunbar's soft illustrations make Bertie seem talented and sweet, rather than foolish. His rosy cheeks and sheer joy at \\"being the dog\\" expresses the simple joy of playing-at-something.<br /><br />Bertie's physical and imaginative activity is interrupted by reality: An actual dog that needs an \\"owner.\\"  Bertie, who tends to think in absolutes, slightly recoils and cries when he realizes that the \\"perfect\\" dog is not blue.  Dunbar's background turns from an innocent, happy yellow to a thoughtful, grey-blue, full of shadowy doubt and complexity. Bertie, in a stroke of simple genius, makes the dog blue, by making the dog.... \\"Blue!\\"<br /><br />Bertie and Blue, now on yellow-backed pages, make a \\"perfect pair!\\" Bertie learned to expand his schema of the \\"perfect dog\\" to accommodate non-blue dogs named \\"Blue,\\" and Blue, just happy to have the love of a boy like Bertie, accommodates the latter's play idea. \\"Bertie took Blue for a walk. Blue took Bertie for a walk. Bertie fed Blue. Blue sniffed Bertie... Blue really loves Bertie. Bertie really loves Blue. Especially when... [next page]<br /><br />it's Bertie's turn to fetch.\\"<br /><br />There is such a feeling of freely given love in this book that it takes a few reading to appreciate it.  Bertie's conditional love, common to toddlers and adults alike, turns unconditional when he accepts the dog. The dog will never be blue, just as kids and adults may never meet their idealized companion. Yet, Bertie opens his heart to the dog, and in his eyes, he is as true a blue as he could hope to find.\\"  If this were the days of \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull,\\" the book would be a potential best seller for adults.  The book makes no such claims or pretensions. It's a humorous, clever, and warm illustration of love for toddlers, and it's perhaps a parable for adults, all in the form of a simply told and simply illustrated kids' book.be blue, just as kids and adults may never meet their idealized companion.

It's awash with the colors and textures of the sea, and uses minimal but effective text.<br /><br />As a family of four set out on \\"a perfect day for sailing,\\" they \\"row the dinghy out to our sailboat\\" among soft blues and greens and foggy mists lying over the still bay. Crew's New England seascape includes a wooden bridge (drawn from below), a lighthouse on a hill, and a WHOOSH! of wind as they ride the waves. The varied font sizes and colors (there also a gigantic \\"SAIL AWAY.\\"), make this simple story of a day on the water an exciting and engaging one. Later, the \\"clear skies turn cloudy and gray.\\"  Soon, the waves are high and peaked, the clouds much greyer, and Cruise adds yet more drama with a big-fonted \\"Angry seas,\\" and the shouted command \\"Shorten sails!\\"<br /><br />As the boat heads home, the storm abates, night begins to fall, and the lighthouse illuminates the bay. In a particularly beautiful picture, the sailboat floats under the silhouetted bridge, decorated with tiny white lights over its suspension wires. The family makes it safely and calmly back, and in a green, quiet sea, we view the now empty, now tranquil boat, \\"moored!\\"<br /><br />I'm not sure how many kids will know the meaning of \\"moored,\\" but this is a nearly perfect book for toddlers and younger: A simple but exciting story, with colorful illustrations, and a soft and comforting conclusion.  Very well done!	2005-06-20

B. Johnson's synthesis is a triumph of imagination and talent.<br /><br />The story illustrates a section of Henry David Thoreau's famous \\"Waldon Pond,\\" in which the philosopher mused about a hypothetical 30-mile race to Fitchburg. He would walk there, \\"because I have learned that the swiftest traveler is he that goes afoot.\\"  His competitor could travel by train-but would have to earn the 90-cent fare before he could board.  Thoreau concludes that he would not only win, but would have the richer experience: \\"Instead of going to Fitchburg, you will be working here the greater part of the day.\\"<br /><br />Johnson takes these exact terms and turns it into a race between two bears, Henry (the Thoreau namesake), and his unnamed friend.  Already we have an exciting premise for a story, but the first page's relatively traditional illustration gives way to several more unconventional, modern art styles in the succeeding pages.  If you're at all a modern art fan, or are just intrigued by it, you'll find these pictures of colored pencil and paint astounding and beautiful. But why did the author/illustrator take this route, when, like Henry's friend, he might have chosen a more predictable style?<br /><br />Part of the answer, I think, lies in that question itself, the predictable route is the safe one, the utilitarian one, whether for a traveler or for an author wishing to sell books.  Like Thoreau, like Frost afterwards, Johnson takes the more unpredictable route, the one offering higher risk and reward.  His bear, Henry, enlivens two other transcendental values-- \\"marching to the beat of a distant drummer\\" and the disdain for conformity-\\"the hobgoblin of little minds.\\" Henry's chosen path encompasses more sensation and wonder than that of his friend, and the art opens and illustrates his spirit of discovery.  The book's illustrations, as in much of modern art, restates and reconfigures objects in ways that meet the goals of the transcendentalists: To find the transcendental in the ordinary, and the ordinary in the transcendental.<br /><br />A collection of colorful and unexpected treats inspired by the late 19th and early 20th century greats compliments Johnson's celebration of spontaneity and sensation. We see Picasso and Braques (the almost full-blown of Henry, half-submerged, crossing the river; the elongated noses from  Picasso's `Three Women'-though they're more conventional on bears!), Dali surrealism (the henhouse picture with the seemingly giant spoon and the tiny clock), Cezanne' post-impressionist bridge to cubism, Mondrian's blocks of color (the friend painting a fence that divides and frames his features) Rousseau's primitivism, and Matisse's liberating use of color, Asian-inspired aesthetics. It's interesting that Johnson does not limit these styles to the pictures of Henry, they're even in of his friend, earning his fare performing such seemingly mundane tasks as pulling weeds, sweeping the post office, and moving the bookcases (\\"in Mr. Emerson's study\\").  At times, for example in the gardening and train pictures, it seems that the friend is discovering the transcendental in the ordinary-Johnson's gift to his fictional bear and to the reader.<br /><br />A second and more important question (after why Johnson chose this mode of illustration) is whether kids will enjoy the book.  I think most of them will: While the pictures are \\"unusual\\" (though like the modernists, especially Paul Klee, they emulate young kids' \\"purer\\" drawings), the story and the actions are appealing.  There's a race-who will win?  On his walk to Fitchburg, Henry's senses lead him to eat his way through a blackberry patch, walk on New England's stonewalls, paddle up the Nashua river, and climb a honey tree. His friend engages in such rural activities as bringing water to the cows and wheeling \\"flour from the mill to the village baker.  20 cents.\\"  (Johnson includes lots of money and distance numbers-he even presents the purely educational).<br /><br />The pictures may confuse some kids, and also delight, inspire, and reinforce them own efforts as well. Pictures aside, the book is exciting, told clearly, appealing to many age groups, and is non-judgmental about the two paths taken by the bear friends. D. B. Johnson's achievement should have received a trunk load of prizes.<br /><br />Enjoyable on many levels, this is a fun, exciting, and stimulating book.

At first, the magazine devoted a disproportionate number of articles to \\"gentlemenly\\" pursuits such as troutfishing and yachting.  However, the once timid magazine eventually hit its stride, with the help of television, with the talents of new editors and writers, and, arguably, by the visuals of television.<br /><br />The book, with an informative but slightly cloying introduction by Frank Deford (he keeps on mentioning the swimsuit issue--about as relevant to the major sports scene as yachting was 50 years ago), organizes the magazine's stories and pictures by the decade.  A current sportswriter gives an overview, there arearticles from the magazines, sidebar-like features such as quotes, historic cultural and historical events, and, most  importantly, the photographs.<br /><br />SI photography is the best of its kind, setting a standard that will defy any attempt to cater to some notion of the \\"new\\" SI reader.  It is as dependable and as beautiful as a museum.  The full page and two-page spreads here are magnificent records of sports history, character studies, stories of emotion, action, the literal and the figurative.  A low angle shot of the then-named Lew ALcindor beating Houston in 1968. an underwater shot of Michael Phelps winning gold at the Australia Olympics, a black and white of Duke Snider climbng the outer field wall at Ebbets Field, an extreme overhead of Ali knocking out Cleveland Williams in 1966, mini-reproductions of cover of every issue, and yes, that includes the swimsuit issues--it's here at an overwhelmingly fan-friendly price.<br /><br />In a way, then, the book is a direct descendant of the unique magazine of which one British man complained in 1954: \\"For 25 cents there is too much value.\\"  Although the book was produced bt SI and--as expected--celebrates SI, it also teases itself as well, noting that in 1954, \\"it published only six articles on basketball but 14 on bowling. It published 17 articles on clothing (but oddly, none on bowling clothing).\\"  My only complaints: There's not quite enough of the original text (more of the writing is included in a companion book) and there is no index.

Notably, there is John Irving, who managed to place bears in \\"The Hotel New Hampshire,\\" and other books, and there's the Pinkwater (Dan and Jill), who have givwritten such masterpieces as \\"Young Larry,\\" \\"Bongo Larry,\\" and \\"At the Hotel Larry.\\"  Now the Pinkwaters give us Irving and Mukluk, two polar bears unrelated to Larry and his brother Roy, but just as irresistible in their own way. Their way, by the way, is larceny, and they pursue one object only-the abundant muffins of Yellowtooth (\\"in the frozen north\\"), baked by the Yellowtoothians whenever there's a celebration. The people of Yellowtooth, according to Daniel Pinkwater, are raucous folks, partying all night, drinking root beer, and gambling! \\"They are a hard lot,\\" comments Pinkwater in his signature wry humor, \\"but they have a soft spot in their hearts for blueberry muffins.\\" The celebrations happen once a year, and every year, Irving and Muktuk concoct the absolute worst disguises ever worn in an effort to capture this booty.<br /><br />The book is a series of similarly formulated gags. Irving and Muktuk cloak themselves in obviously fake disguises (although their knowing smiles hint that they think they are just too clever for Yellowtooth).  They masquerade as \\"two orphan penguins\\" (complete with visibly tied-on, capes, masks, and stockings), \\"two adorable Girl Scouts\\" (who, strangely, insist on a muffin payment for their Girl Scout cookies), and as \\"two famous chefs from Bayonne, New Jersey\\" (the reported center of muffin making and appreciation) arriving to judge a Yellowtooth muffin baking contest.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the scheming polar bears, they have a formidable opponent in the straight-laced, stolid Officer Bunny-a Mountie -like critter with a keen and logical mind.  Officer Bunny who maintains law and order in Yellowtooth, he invariably sees through the awful disguises and sends the over-confident bears away by helicopter: \\"FWOP! FWOP! FWOP! Oh my! It is the helicopter! FWOP! FWOP! FWOP!\\" \\"Once again, you have failed to obtain muffins by stealth and subterfuge.\\"  Western civilization is safe again.<br /><br />The bears' last disguise is their best: They curl up and try to pass \\"as blueberry muffins-extremely large, hairy muffins.\\" However, Officer Bunny detects Muktuk drooling.  Luckily, a zookeeper in, of all places, Bayonne, New Jersey offers to keep the bears. Even more luckily, the zoo is immediately adjacent to a giant muffin factory, operating 24 hours a day.  Although the last picture of the airborne, handcuffed bears is a trifle disturbing, there is almost no doubt that they are already plotting their first raid on the muffin manufacturing plant.<br /><br />The book is more structured and episodic than those in the freewheeling, more character-driven \\"Larry\\" series. Young toddlers may enjoy the repeated motif of disguise-recognition-capture-reappearance, and the disguises are humorously transparent. Slightly older kids may be somewhat too sophisticated for this predictable repetition; the Larry series--with its incongruous situations and sly wit-- is probably more appropriate.<br /><br />Jill Pinkwater's illustrations are bright and captivating; she sets vivid, sometimes clashing colors against each other, and evokes the Arctic night.  She also cleverly contrasts the rigid posture and certain lines of Officer Bunny with the furry and morally fuzzy contours of the two would-be muffin thieves. Her Arctic (and Bayonne, New Jersey) illustrations were drawn with felt tip markers and ink.  For true Pinkwater fans, there's a nice picture of the couple (with their dog, or one of them, perhaps) on the back inside cover.FWOP! Oh my! It is the helicopter! FWOP! FWOP!

The illustrations are simple but captivating because of the perspective, details, and soft, comforting colors. We see Fireman Small way atop a Christmas tree in a bustling city, two startled pigs in a brick apartment building looking up at him. In front of \\"ellie's caf&eacute;,\\" an alligator solicits charitable donations, a giraffe and tortoise walk stiffly by, presents in hand, and a parent and child elephant duo buy something hot from a pig warmly dressed for the snow.  There are full-page illustrations faced by Yee's rhymes, and by smaller, slightly one-dimensional pictures that help punctuate the story.<br /><br />When Fireman Small finishes his civic duties, he heads back home to firehouse nine. Around midnight, he hears a CRASH! downstairs: \\"Quickly out of bed he scoots, Jumps into his pants and boots. Ready to go, he slides down the pole, See two legs sticking out of the coal!\\"  It's Santa!  After he washes Santa's clothes, Small discovers that the worn out Santa has fallen asleep in his bunk.  He faces a dilemma:  \\"What about the good girls and boys?  Who will deliver the rest of the toys?\\"<br /><br />Yee does a wonderful job of presenting the tale matter-of-factly and without condescension. He subtlely illustrates Small's real concern about the toys, and when the reindeer won't let him take the reigns, Fireman Small determinedly takes the wheel of the fire truck. His pictures of nighttime, snow, a darkened house, and the downstairs section of the firehouse are atmospheric, soft, and very imaginatively drawn.  Kids will enjoy Small's delivery of the presents to all the neighborhood animals:<br /><br />\\"At Farmer Pig's farm, he leaves a straw hat,<br /><br />New overalls, and a chew toy for Cat,<br /><br />Beaver's gift is her own Ping-Pong paddle,<br /><br />Rabbit gets a rocking horse and a saddle.\\"<br /><br />The conclusion is happy, with a sly little twist. Yee, veteran of many books for kids, has written a simple yet somehow original story that is precious in the very best sense of that word. His watercolors are soothing, imaginative, and enchanting.  This is the fourth Fireman Small book; I'm looking forward to reading more of them.little twist.

They only gave me a dime.\\"  The opening of \\"The Babe and I\\" alludes to the Great Depression, specifically 1932 Bronx, where the unnamed protagonist loves his family first and baseball second. At least his dad is employed, every morning he pits on a suit and takes his briefcase to his office. \\"We were lucky. My father had a job. But we never seemed to have much money.\\" Accompanying his friend Jacob on his paper route, he discovers that his Dad's office is a street corner where he sells apples. In fact, every corner has an apple vendor, selling one for a nickel.<br /><br />However, the reader will notice a schism between the words and the illustrations. If this is the Great Depression, it's the Disneyland version:  The houses, streets, and sidewalks are squeaky cleaned, the \\"shabby and wrinkled\\" clothes are clean and in one piece, and no stores are boarded up.  Illustrator Terry Widener composes nice wide angled street scenes, illustrates the men in a 1930's movie style with broad shoulders and hats, and draws the boys looking prematurely old, but the Depression looks clean and calm.  Only when the son asks his father about his secret job do we see a more realistic view of the emotional toil, as he walks sadly down a deserted (but really clean!) street:  \\"Dad didn't say anything after that. I didn't either. We just walked.\\"<br /><br />Babe Ruth enters the picture when he supports the boy's budding newspaper job.  Injured, the yellow-suited Sultan of Swat (also looking a bit too healthy) comes to Yankee stadium and gives him $5.00 for a 25-cent paper. (The Babe's injury, his pinch hitting, and other events reported here are \\"based on actual events that were reported July 14 through July 22, 1932.) Aside from Ruth's baseball heroics that result in the boy selling more newspapers, that's the entire extent of Babe's role in \\"The Babe and I,\\" and the title suddenly seems misleading.  On the last page, author Adler strains to make the connection more prominent:<br /><br />\\"Babe Ruth was part of the 1932 Yankees. That year they were the best team in baseball. He and I were a team, too. His home runs helped me sell newspapers...I knew Dad and I were a team too. We were both working to get our family through hard times.\\" (All this under a picture of the father in a nice blue suit walking from away their well-kept brownstone on an immaculate sidewalk.)<br /><br />Looking beyond the pictures (and perhaps you'd rather not show signs of poverty to your young one), the book's strength is its portrayal of family dynamics, the father with his secret--and his anger-- and the son trying to help. (The mother doesn't find out, and, in addition, is barely seen.)  However, the book should could focused somewhat more realistically on the material and social effects of poverty, or at least emphasized the Babe more. Although there is about little economic hard times, a better book about Ruth's own difficulties is Donald Hall and Barry Moser's \\"When Willard Met Babe Ruth.\\"  \\"The Babe and I\\" hints at the era, but I'm still looking for a kids' book that better illustrates the links between the Depression and baseball.uthor Adler strains to make the connection more prominent: <br />\\"Babe Ruth was part of the 1932 Yankees.

207604:US	49600435	R1A46W5IU38YYR	0803280351	310365062	Chicago: The Second City	Books	5	11	13	N	Y	"The Only Completely Corrupt City in America"	The 1890 census showed that, for the first time, Chicago was the second most populous city in the nation, supplanting Philadelphia.  New York, then as now, remained at the top.  This one-down relationship gave the Windy City its other famous nickname, \\"The Second City,\\" which in this book suggests both its inferiority to New York and its incessant striving. Chicagoans seem ambivalent about their status. \\"People you meet at a party devote a great deal more time than people elsewhere to talking about good government, but they usually wind up the evening boasting about the high quality of the crooks they have met.\\"  An alderman tells Liebling that Chicago \\"is the only completely corrupt city in America.\\"  When Liebling reminds him of other corrupt cities, the alderman replies defensively, 'But they aren't nearly as big.'\\"<br /><br />Essayist, reporter, humorist A.J. Liebling, himself a New Yorker (who first visited Chicago in 1938, and lived there for about a year between 1949 and 1950, and briefly in 1951), takes a Big Apple-centric view in these 1953 essays originally published in The New Yorker, a magazine to which he frequently contributed. Today, he is perhaps best remembered for his sports writing, especially boxing (\\"The Sweet Science)\\" and each year pugilism's top journalistic prize is the \\"A.J. Liebling Award.\\"  Here, Liebling takes aim at the decline of Chicago in the arts, industry, and design, noting the city's brief but glorious apotheosis at the turn of the century and its largely futile self-aggrandizement since then.  \\"The city consequently has the personality of man brought up in the expectation of a legacy who has learned in middle age that it will never be his.\\"  As a good journalist, Liebling wanted to discover the cause of the turnabout, and Chicago natives who agreed with him offered their own theories:<br /><br />\\"Chicago could have had the automobile if Chicago money had gone after it,' a Chicago stockbroker once assured me. \\"But the big boys let it go by default, they didn't want an industry here that would dwarf them.'\\" Others trace it to the pacifist stance of Jane Addams (of Hull House fame) during the WWI. In any event, says Liebling, Chicago has been playing catch-up ever since, and the native seems to feel taken. Plays in Chicago are presumed inferior to the New York production of the same play, or, \\"if they are the New York production, with original casts intact,\\" the actors are presumed to give an inferior performance.  Mid-20th Chicago's response to its percieved victimization and inferiority is a pathetic boosterism; pathetic because, try as it may, the Second City's efforts are invariably second-rate, bourgeois, and unknowingly kitschy. FOr example, Liebling complains that Chicago restuarants, unlike those in New York, feel they must actually convince you drink or dine, and so stage hokey shows and color their menus with decorous prose:<br /><br />\\"The Porterhouse, a restaurant in the Hotel Sherman, when I last looked in on it, had six cowboys violinists in fringed pants to play \\"Tales from the Vienna Woods,\\" at your table in order to sell you a hamburger, and the menu listed credits for costume and scenic design.  The urge to embellishment found literary outlet in the listing of things to eat, such as `Ah, the PORTERHOUSE!  Aristocrat of steaks...most delectable of steaks. Greatest of all the steaks, for within it are encompassed the Tenderloin, the Sirloin, the meaty bone of the full loin.'\\"<br /><br />As in his brilliant \\"The Telephone Booth Indian,\\" Liebling seems drawn to the proletariat, and especially, the scam.  Part of Liebling's appeal-and his power as a satirist-is his ability to cloak subjective opinion in the details and tone of the objective journalist.  His field reports, however, are highly selective.  Liebling's liberal quoting of slang adds to his authenticity:  \\"The Chicago bars also employ blondes known as dice girls, who...keep score on customers attempting a ten-dice gamecalled Twenty-Six. If you win, the house pays four to one, which gives it a seventeen-percent edge. This is about the same as the take of the parimutual machines in New York State.  The bar, however, pays its four to one in trade, on which there is a profit of perhaps three hundred percent. One of my most astute Chicago friends, a native, believes the girls [cheat]. I do not believe this for a minute, but it illustrates the working of the Chicago mind.  It is inconceivable to my friend that the house should be content with the monumental advantage it already has.\\" Liebling also toys with the Chicago natives who wrote to protest his \\"New Yorker\\" pieces. One critic wrote that he hoped he would be the first to \\"...grasp the hand of Mr. Liebling as he staggers (I hope) backward from reading such reactionaries as this one of many of which he must be in recipience daily!\\"  Liebling, explaining that he will add some of his own comments to the book's footnotes, writes that he has \\"added a few of my own reactionaries to those of which I have been in recipience.\\"<br /><br />Saul Steinberg, also of \\"New Yorker\\" fame, augments the text with his stylized line drawings. Liebling writes that the view from Lake Michigan is a \\"serrated wall of high buildings,\\" but that Chicagoans know that \\"what they see is like a theatre backdrop with a city painted on it\\"; Steinberg draws a convincing picture of a façade. The sense of fakery extends to Chicago's long running scams in politics, the judicial system, and law enforcement.  Liebling interviews a crooked otherwise well-intentioned alderman, who innocently talks about his responsibilites to procure (i.e., buy)  votes and procure jobs for the loyal. He describes the city's fixation on the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre, contrasting this with its shorter attention span to current, but more prosaic homicides.  Other objects of Liebling's reportage include Chicago Tribune publisher Robert R. McCormick, Chicago sports (though this section is surprisingly brief), strip joints' fleecing of conventioneers,  racial tensions (\\"Chicago's greatest present danger\\"), and Chicago's intellectual climate: \\"Everyone you meet belongs to a Great Books Discussion Group [but] the samplings of them are exceedingly small.\\"  \\"In Chicago intellectual circles, a man who can't do a psychoanalysis between two Martinis ranks with a fellow who can't change a tire.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Second City\\" is an interesting though largely dated book; many of the then-current colloquialisms and allusions are obscure today.  While Liebling doesn't seem secretly fond of Chicago, his other books suggest that he sees urban and proletarian shortcomings as something indelible in the American way, and there's a kind of sympathetic undertone.  However, Chicagoans (and others) who read this Liebling book only might rightfully take offense at some of his pot shots, comments that seem to unfairly single out Chicago. Although Liebling is a master wordsmith and his dry humor is keen, the writing doesn't seem quite as nimble, witty, and strong  as in \\"The Sweet Science\\" (about boxing) or the aforementioned \\"Telephone Booth Indian.\\" Still, Liebling's observations skills--his eye and ear for the telling quote or description-are intact and entertaining.he house pays four to one, which gives it a seventeen-percent edge.

Henry drags his clearly unhappy sister, Beatrice to the library, where he needs to finish a paper.  Beatrice refuses Henry's suggestion to read; instead, she just wants to watch him work, and she pours herself and her saccharine smile all over the increasingly frustrated Henry. Beatrice follows Henry for three straight days, until Henry has had enough. The reader may have had enough of Beatrice as well, for the humor of her unvarying, cloying smile is stale after awhile.<br /><br />On the third day, Henry sees a library poster announcing a book reading that afternoon.  Henry encourages his sister to attend, but Beatrice says, \\"I don't want to.\\"  Henry comes back with, \\"Too bad!\\"  While waiting for the reading to begin, a dog introduces herself to Beatrice: \\"'Hello. My name is Wanda,' said the girl in the next chair. `This is the second time I've heard this story.'\\" \\"'Big deal!'\\" said Beatrice.<br /><br />However (surprise, surprise), the book reading is a big hit.  The librarian reads about Albert Mouse and his new roller skates, and Beatrice, who likes to roller skate, begins to show interest and even smile.  Like Albert, she had once roller-skated in the house, and she listens and laughs and even looks over the book after the reading. When Henry comes to take her home, she replies, \\"I don't want to,\\" hugging the book with her eyes closed dreamily and a big smile on her face.<br /><br />The warm and welcoming story may encourage kids who have reservations about libraries or reading.  Munsinger clearly depicts Beatrice's emotions, but she relies too heavily on Beatrice's somewhat comical expressions.  The book's thin plot is fairly predictable.  The pictures are too static and the colors are not very imaginative or exciting. Actually, Henry seems the more interesting of the two dogs, and the best scenes are those in which the brother interacts with his sister.nteresting of the two dogs, and the best scenes are those in which the brother interacts with his sister.	2005-06-09

He cleverly engages his toddler or early grade school audience by showing them a picture with which they can identify--A boy in a sandbox playing with a truck.  Then, Collicutt ups the interest level by immediately showing captioned pictures of real working trucks. Notice how he sequences the first three pages:  He begins with the toy truck (\\"This truck is small.\\"), then to a logging truck (This truck is big.\\"), ending with an extremely tall truck with trees in its container (\\"This truck is enormous.\\").<br /><br />Collicut presents similar contrasts throughout the book, such as a truck that pours out salt on the lefthand page, and a truck sweeps up litter on the right; an old truck that's \\"overloaded,\\" contrasted with a large truck that \\"has no load at all;\\" a truck that \\"crawls through the desert\\" versus a fire truck that \\"races through the city.\\" The varied selection of trucks, and the succinct descriptions keep things simple but interesting.<br /><br />I especially like Collicut's vigorous illustrations: The trucks look muscular and energetic, and boldly colored backgrounds give them a context. He's especially talented with blue and purple shades, at times giving them an almost luminescent glow.  THe book has a big \\"WOW!\\" factor, and is suitable for individual or small group presentations. In addition, the book's short sentences and word repetition helps beginning readers.<br /><br />Mr. Collicutt doesn't even forget his adult audience: The front endpapers show small, labeled pictures of historic trucks, including \\"Labatt's Streamliner (Canada, 1948), a Sentinel diesel DV46T coal dump truck (U.K., 1955), and a Ford Model T fire engine (U.S.A, 1919); the back endpapers show some unusual modern trucks (e.g., Japan's Komatsu D575A-2 Super Dozer, the Ford Big Foot 4 X 4 \\"Monster Truck\\", the Liebherr 240-ton giant dump truck from Germany).

Bertil, an imaginative six-year old, believe (or pretends to believe) that a pair of elephants live in the bathroom (it appears that they are inspired by the trunk-shaped pipe leading from the bathtub to the floor).  Bertil's invention allows him to blame his own mishaps and mischief on the two elephants.  Eva Lindstrom's casual, not to scale illustrations clearly show Bertil pouring a bucket of bath water on the floor and letting a spray nozzle point upwards, thus making a flood in the bathroom. However, Bertil has the convenient excuse of the elephants:<br /><br />\\"'It's the elephants!'<br /><br />`The what?' says Mom.<br /><br />\\"That's right. Bathroom elephants, A pair of them. They live there,' say Bertil pointing under the tub. `They spray a lot' `....They squirt with their trunks even though I've told them not to' he says, sounding upset.\\"<br /><br />The imaginary playmate/animal is a common motif, usually a substitute for a real friend, but here a scapegoat for Bertil's misadventures.  He gets lots of positive attention from his parents and younger brother, and he floods the bathroom, cracks the ceiling, and flushes Dad's underwear down the toilet with impunity-he's got it good.<br /><br />So, perhaps the authors wanted to make something original out of this device, because the elephants abruptly turn in Bertil's enemies.  Perhaps, they wanted to illustrate the difficulties of potty-training (usually, although of course not always, accomplished by age six, by the way) , because this is when the elephants first seem threatening to Bertil.  They make strange noises, and Bertil runs from the bathroom; later he won't enter the room without his mom.  She makes plans to starve the elephants. However Bertil hears more sounds when he's sitting on the toilet, and he runs and falls down--his butt prominently displayed in the picture. Here, Bertil looks positively scared lying half-naked on the floor:  \\"'They tried to kill me'! screams Bertil. `I'm never going in there again. Never!'\\" Is this some comeuppance for his earlier fabrication?  Just what was the point of changing the elephants from allies to enemies? The author's point of view is never clear, the parents are psychologically inept (it appears they resort to lying to \\"get rid\\" of the elephants), and Bertil is not especially appealing.  Perhaps the book was better in the original Swedish.oor:  \\"'They tried to kill me'! screams Bertil. `I'm never going in there again.

A book about wiping noses?!  It's actually more interesting than it sounds, and not nearly as \\"gross\\" as it could have been, thanks to the restrained illustrations and funny story.  In Lisa Kopelke's acrylic drawings, the frogs seem puffy and furry-- as if somehow sheep got mixed into the gene pool. The frogs have big expressive eye and eyelids, and long, long legs with huge webbed feet. At first, they look kind of ugly, but they grow on you-so to speak.<br /><br />And when they sneeze and \\"snuffle,\\" clouds of steam come from their noses. They also wipe their noses on their arms.<br /><br />After school, the frog friends bicycle to-what else?-a dance class to practice for their recital. The frog named \\"Frog\\" still had a runny nose, which made it difficult to dance. `Schnorrrkle!' Frog rang out. When his friends heard him, they remembered their noses were runny too.\\"  The five frogs become \\"one huge chorus of sniffles and  snuffles,\\" and they once again wipe their noses on their arms.  Their teacher, Miss Tutu, \\"was so disgusted, all she could say was `Yuck!'\\" Again, there is nothing disgusting in Kopelke's drawing of the scene.<br /><br />At home, Frog's mother gives him a tissue when he beings to snuffle. He is positively amazed at how well it works! In a clever illustration, Kopelke shows the clouds lifting away around Frog-he has seen the light! It's just in the nick of time too, because Frog's nose begins to run again at the dance recital, right in the middle of a grand plie! HE reaches for a tissue, incorporates it into the dance, and voila-- by George he's got it!  Ms. Kopelke draws a wonderful overhead spread showing the frogs dancing and disposing of their tissues in a combination of ballet and  basketball.  The improvisation is so triumphant, \\"from that day on the Dance of the Tissue-Box Fairies was the big finale of every dance recital.<br /><br />This is a superbly illustrated and original story.  It easily stands as an entertaining book for all kids, but it's also an instructive tool for sniffly ones who haven't discovered the joy of tissues.

Besides an abstract picture of a tree trunk with a caterpillar and a purple, turquoise, and white/translucent dragonfly, the unnamed narrator informs us: \\"This tree was here when we moved in.\\"  On the next half page insert, the caterpillar is further up the tree, and the narrator says, rather mysteriously, \\"Dad says it's a pie tree.\\"  Turn the last half-page insert, and small red dots with tiny black eyes-ladybugs-join the caterpillar on the tree trunk. There's another engaging \\"hook\\" in large letters:  \\"I've never seen pies growing on trees.  Wouldn't that be something?\\"<br /><br />Except for the initial inserts, every page of author/illustrator Lois Ehlert's unusually compelling nature/mystery book is increasingly elaborated but similarly formatted: There's an eye-dazzling collage, a one  or two-sentence narrative that hints at the tantalizing but puzzling prospect of a \\"pie tree,\\"  and smaller-font prose poetry that references the collage and doubles as a vocabulary builder:<br /><br />I see<br /><br />green leaves,<br /><br />white blossoms,<br /><br />yellow pollen dust,<br /><br />blue eggs<br /><br />In a brown nest,<br /><br />yellow honeybees,<br /><br />and black stripes<br /><br />On a yellow<br /><br />Butterfly.<br /><br />But no pie.<br /><br />Ehlert's collages use a variety of materials-including origami papers, wood veneers, vellum, sheet metal, cherry tree branches-to complement her acrylic, watercolor, colored pencil, oil pastel, and crayon drawn illustrations. The result is an incredibly textured group of collages that are among the best illustrations of 2004. Somehow, they're abstract and realistic, brilliantly colored, and gracefully beautiful without being precious or too delicate. The story is similarly well balanced: The paean to nature is evident (\\"Sweet spring is here at last\\" .... \\"But now a damp wind is blowing, and all the flower petals are falling down like rain\\"), but just when things threaten to become overwrought, the child's voice returns, and the mystery of the pie tree is solved: It's a cherry tree, and birds and butterflies and even a raccoon (\\"But, hey, raccoon, save some for us!\\")  have already begun their \\"feast.\\" Now it's the child and his or her dad's turn, and the book concludes by showing the preparations for a very cherry-filled pie.  It is, after all, a pie tree.<br /><br />An outstanding picture book, with an original story and excellent pedantic value as well (i.e., all that vocabulary building and object searching), this is one pie in the sky that delivers.  Definitely recommended.is blowing, and all the flower petals are falling down like rain\\"), but just when things threaten to become overwrought, the child's voice returns, and the mystery of the pie tree is solved: It's a cherry tree, and birds and butterflies and even a raccoon (\\"But, hey, raccoon, save some for us!\\")  have already begun their \\"feast.\\" Now it's the child and his or her dad's turn, and the book concludes by showing the preparations for a very cherry-filled pie.

On Toby's left hand is the only thing that his friend left behind, a \\"baseball glove that smells like Parmesan cheese. Too soon, he checks the mailbox for a letter, and from the mailbox end, we see a gigantic empty container, with Tony peering into it.  \\"'Empty.' Toby sighs,\\" maybe a little like e feels. Who can take the place of Toby? Who will he play with now?<br /><br />While perhaps no one can really take the place of Toby, the possibilities of new friendships arrive in the shape of snowflakes. As they land around him, each one invites Toby to play:<br /><br />\\"Some tell jokes. Others talk about movies they have seen. One snowflake wishes for a warm piece of pecan pie...A snowflake voice calls out, `Come play in us. Be our friend.'\\"  At their invitation, the now smiling Toby play sin the snow, makes a snowman whom he calls Dennis.  But soon, the snow begins to melt, including the snowman (on whom he has put his friend's baseball glove).  Toby is baffled and confused, but again, a snowflake answers Toby's question, \\"Why is everybody leaving?\\"<br /><br />\\"...this is what we do. We snow, we disappear, we come back again.  It is the nature of the snowflake.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps it is also the nature of friends. As the book concludes, Toby finds a new friend. It's not his best friend-not yet, anyway-but his name is Gary, he likes baseball, and at home he has a glove  that \\"smells like cheddar cheese.\\" As they walk off to a potentially beautiful new relationship, the smiling Toby waves fondly to the slowly melting snowman, who smiles back at him.  This is a simple yet poignant story about change and transition by the wife and husband team of Julie Halpern (author) and Matthew Cordell (illustrator). The narrative is appropriately straightforward and emotions are described simply but directly, except for the snowman, a projection of Toby's feelings for his friend that perhaps only older children will \\"get.\\"<br /><br />Cordell captures Toby's feelings through facial expression and the composition of the watercolor illustrations. Toby himself is appealingly rounded and soft looking, like a toy doll. The clean lines and minimalism are also effectively used in the landscapes, and Cordell `s use of superimposed purple font for the snowflakes' words makes their speech clear and believable.  In a book dealing with complex emotions, Cordell and author Halpern have stripped away distracting embellishments, focusing instead on the fundamental emotional and narrative elements. At the same time, the book isn't too simple; it's an absorbing story that abstracts Toby's many feelings in a creative and soft manner.an, a projection of Toby's feelings for his friend that perhaps only older children will \\"get.\\"   <br /> <br />Cordell captures Toby's feelings through facial expression and the composition of the watercolor illustrations.

This semi-autobiographical work shows the downside of celebrity, especially if you're a children's book author touring a local elementary school. It has the signature Pinkwater combination of silly and dry humor that engages readers of all ages, and features Pinkwater's bright, splashy illustrations.<br /><br />Almost nothing goes right for Mr. Bramwell Wink-Porter, the famous children's author, when he tours a grade school of adoring child and adult fans. The librarian (who is so awe-stricken with Wink-Porter that he faints whenever meeting him) hangs a banner celebrating Wink-Porter as the author of \\"The Fuzzy Bunny.\\" Unfortunately, Wink-Porter wrote \\"The Bunny Brothers,\\" not \\"The Fuzzy Bunny.\\" (Abigail Finkdotter wrote the Fuzzy Bunny.) This same mistake is made in every classroom he visits: The children and teachers repeatedly tell him how much they enjoyed \\"The Fuzzy Bunny,\\" ask questions about \\"The Fuzzy Bunny,\\" and in grades 2 and 3, even wear \\"Fuzzy Bunny\\" hats. The first stop is kindergarten, when Mrs. Neatfeet's kids hug the visiting author (who bears some resemblance to Daniel Pinkwater).  \\"'They are very sticky children,' Bramwell Wink-Porter said. `They are not usually this sticky,' Mrs. Neatfeet told him. `It is the syrup.'  `Yes,' said Bramwell-Porter (with his usual calm).  The author is \\"made to eat a cold, lumpy pancake with a piece of green crayon it ....\\"<br /><br />But things get even more challenging.  The 2nd and 3rd graders subject him to a grilling, ostensibly about \\"The Funny Bunny\\" (which, of course, he didn't write), and then proceed to other irrelevant questions and shows of superiority:<br /><br />\\"'Was it hard to write The Funny Bunny?' they asked him.<br /><br />`No, it was not very hard...I suppose,' Bramwell Wink Porter said.<br /><br />`What is your favorite rodent?'<br /><br />`That's easy--a bunny,' said Bramwell Wink-Porter.<br /><br />`A bunny isn't properly a rodent. Bunnies belong to the order Lagomorphia.'<br /><br />`What is the greatest number of hot dogs you have eaten at one sitting?'<br /><br />`Eleven.'\\"<br /><br />Further insult and injury ensue: He is bitten by the 4th graders' pet bunny, and the 6th graders almost tie him up, just like ther hero in \\"The Fuzzy Bunny.\\"  There's also an excellent teachers' lunchroom scene, where Bramwell-Porter shares the other guests include Mrs. Wheatbeet, Mrs. Heatseat (these names will guarantee giggles from toddlers).  One teacher brings him a sandwich: \\"It is bologna and shredded carrots with extra mayonnaise, the favorite lunch of the Fuzzy Bunny in your wonderful book.\\" As he takes a bite, \\"a slice of bologna squirted out of the sandwich, and stuck to his shirt.\\"<br /><br />Somehow, Wink-Porter meets these indignities with amazing aplomb, perhaps he's gotten used to them.  By taking the adult's point of view, and this calm reaction, Pinkwater may help kids with some perspective taking that may benefit them on the playground or interacting with adults (even if they're not famous authors).<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a very funny book with an original plot, a surprise on the last page, and appealing, casually drawn color pictures. The names, the zany plot, and the complications recall some of P.G. Wodehouse's comedies. The book may also help adult fans understand what celebrities sometimes face.  One of the teachers, Mrs. Wheatbeat, wants Wink-Porter to read her 900 page book, \\"Bunnies in Love,\\" while he eats lunch, and offers to wait outside his home if he needs more time.  Now I'm a big fan of Daniel Pinkwater (and his spouse, Jill Pinkwater), currently reading more of his kids' books as well as \\"Uncle Boris in the Yukon,\\" aimed at an adolescent/adult audience.

While these may \\"only\\" be board books, this is not common practice, and, if true, does not seem fair to either parent or child.  While small toddlers may or may not remember prior use of pictures, older ones may, and beginning readers are even more like to recognize them. Moreover, board books are often bought as a set; a giver will not be happy to learn that a set of Falconer books includes repeated images.<br /><br />That report (from other reviewers) aside, Falconer's book features the black and white shaded piglet, Olivia. With her softly shaded contours, and crooked smile, Olivia strikes a winning pose in front of one to ten objects in this counting book.  She proudly displays two red bows, hides in a paper bag mask with six sharp teeth, and shows us her four aunts (all looking like older Olivia's), seven accessories (e.g., a cap. A bow tie), eight cousins, and finally 10 portraits of herself-skipping rope, wearing flippers, listening to headphones, and standing on her head.  Numbers corresponding to the objects are written in a crayon style on each page.<br /><br />Of the four counting books I read recently, this rates near the bottom.  Objects and Olivia herself are static looking, and some of the objects are fairly small (e.g., a stack of five books held horizontally) , and the enumeration is sometimes confusing (objects appear on both one- and two-page spreads).  There's no story or theme that ties them together, other than the somehow appealing Olivia.  One other positive is the sturdy book construction, I imagine that's the reason for the proliferation of Olivia books, but I recommend instead Sandra Boynton's funny and very clever counting book \\"Hippos Go Berserk,\\" which is available from Amazon.com. Recommended only for fans of Olivia.	2005-06-01

This very colorful counting book tells the story of Noah and the Ark, borrowing heavily from an old spiritual rather than the somewhat fearful Biblical account.  Instead of  the flood's moral complexities, illustrator Joan Paley's introduction simply tells readers that there are \\"many days and nights of rain.\\"  This is an excellent approach for those needing only a secular version.<br /><br />The spiritual's lyrics (the books shows the musical notes as well) are as follows:<br /><br />\\"Old Noah built a great big Ark, There's one more river to cross.<br /><br />He patched it up with hickory bark, There's one more river to cross.<br /><br />One more river, and that's the river of Jordan.<br /><br />One more river, There's one more river to cross.\\"<br /><br />In her adaptation, Joan Paley changes the first two lines to describe the varying types and numbers of animals entering the Ark; for example, above a two-page picture of two hopping kangaroos (with the number `2' in the corner), she writes:<br /><br />\\"The animals went in two by two,<br /><br />There's one more river to cross,<br /><br />\\"Let's hop right in,\\" said the kangaroo,<br /><br />There's one more river to cross.\\"<br /><br />Similarly, three bears, four bulls, five llamas, six monkeys, seven flamingos, eight aardvarks, and nine turtles (\\"in slow green lines\\"), and ten hens arrive at the ark, and they safely cross the river Jordan and land \\"on Ararat.\\"  Paley specializes in collages, and these boldly colored collages of large foreground animals were constructed from paper shapes colored with watercolors, crayon, pastel, colored pencils, and oil paints. In an unusual bit of puffery, the publishers choose to inform us that \\"the layered shapes create a three-dimensional effect.\\"  The overlays of scribble-scrabble crayon, pastel, and pencil give the otherwise  very professional drawings an appealing look, as if a child prodigy drew them, but the effect is texture, not dimension. If anything, since the emphasis is so focused on the foreground, the perspective is fairly flat. Not until the last page do we see a more conventional presentation of  fore-, mid-, and background.<br /><br />The writing is appropriate for the toddler age group, with a hint of humor (\\"Noah laughed at the monkey's tricks,\\" above a spread showing them swinging on a branch; an elephant \\"chewing a honey bun\\" --to rhyme with \\"one by one\\"), but sometimes it's fairly mundane, and, at worse, a bit forced: \\"Five fluffy llamas did arrive.\\" Still, the link with the spiritual and the big, bright animal pictures provide ample opportunity for classroom or playroom sing-along counting fun.the foreground, the perspective is fairly flat.

Donald Crew admirably captures the nighttime look and feel of a state fair in this beautifully illustrated kids' book.  Using gouache and watercolor, his vivid primary colors contrasts the dark sky with the dazzling neon signs.  One can practically feel the electricity pulsing from the bright lights, and the diffusion of light emits a magical energy.  This super luminosity also enables readers to view the faces and emotions of the diverse crowd: romantic couples, excited kids, hungry teens, and pleased parents.<br /><br />The book's spare prose grasps the essence of the fair's main delights:  Food (\\"So many things to eat and drink. So many choices.\\"), games and prizes (\\"So many games to play.\\"), and rides (And now, on to the RIDES!\\"). There are no animals in Crew's fair; this is strictly a food and rides extravaganza, at least during the night. The rides coverage spans 12 pages, culminating in \\"The best, the best ride of all...the GIANT FERRIS WHEEL!\\" The story concludes with a 2-page spread showing the fairgrounds from the top of the Ferris wheel, and a line of people happily leaving the grounds. As in a picture book, some of the ride pictures have no caption, it's as if Crews anticipated the awe of his young readers. The book has a big \\"WOW\\" factor, mainly due to Crews' outstanding feeling for the electric atmosphere of the fair.<br /><br />Obviously, Crews idealizes the Fair: It is blanketed by uniformly happy customers in a clean and wholesome environment.  I've experienced nothing quite like this. Even in the most controlled venues such as Disneyland, one invariably encounters crying toddlers, parents arguing with their kids and with each other, exorbitant prices, and long lines. However, since this is a book for kids, Crews wisely excludes these details. As a result, he recreates a child's bedazzling experience of  a fair's excitement and wonder.	2005-05-31

This is the first book featuring Michael Emberley's wisegirl mouse, the too-cool-for-school Ruby.  Her personality is evident from page 1...(ok, she's hidden behind a book on page 1, but there's cheese and other snacks on her chair, and Ruby looks like the queen of her squalid domain)...but really evident page 2, when she replies to her mother's request to bring pies to Ruby's grandmother: \\"Yeah?\\" and \\"But, Ma,\\" and  \\"Sure, Ma.\\" When warned against strangers (\\"Do you hear me, Ruby? Never, never trust a cat \\"), Ruby shrugs it off  with an assured and cheeky \\"Never, never, never.\\"<br /><br />Ruby heads out into the mean streets of a Boston city populated only by animals: A trench-coated parrot, an astonished mouse looking out of a widow, a ticket-writing police dog, a kangaroo with a gold bag, a pig with a briefcase, a couple of drunken animals (really).  Emberley knows that a kids' book must stand up to repeated readings, and detailed, surprising illustrations help accomplish this.  Down the street, Ruby is accosted by a giant leather-wearing reptile who tries to steal the pies.  Even in  the face of danger, Ruby acts like one of the Bowery Boys:<br /><br />\\"'Buzz off, barf breath,' Ruby replied, forgetting more of her mother's advise.<br /><br />Smart-mouth twerp, grunted the grimy reptile. \\"What's in the bag?'<br /><br />`None of your beeswax, creepo...'\\"<br /><br />At this point, you may question whether you're comfortable with this language and sheer display of Attitude.<br /><br />It's the big city, after all, complete with drunken animals (we see a few sleeping it off), and bullying thieves.<br /><br />However, Emberley's portrayal the town's rougher section fits with his urban re-writing of \\"Little Red Riding Hood,\\" and his pictures and text are constructed thoughtfully (e.g., the alliteration of \\"grunted the grimy reptile\\"). Still, you'll  need to judge whether or not this is G-rated material for your older toddler or young grade-schooler.<br /><br />A suspiciously nice and well-dressed cat rescues Ruby, and takes an inordinate interest in her destination.  Fortunately, Ruby is more than just mouth; her street smarts alert her to the real danger of this mysterious cat. In just a few words, Emberley conveys the threat behind the gentlemanly façade when he writes that the cat smelled like \\"cat food mixed with cheap peppermint mouthwash.\\"  Ruby outwits the trickster cat, and when she arrives at her granny's house, the cat's hat is perched on the head of granny's friend, Mrs. Mastiff--a muscular dog whose words, lack of appetite, and soft burp hint at the demise of their would-be predator.  Michael Emberley has constructed a noir thriller out of  a chestnut of a fable, and he succeeds dramatically.  More visceral than the later \\"Ruby and the Sniffs,\\" it's also funnier and more sophisticated. For the right child, a superbly written and illustrated contemporary fairy tale.ice and well-dressed cat rescues Ruby, and takes an inordinate interest in her destination.

Books	5	6	6	N	N	4 1/2  Home, But Not Alone	When Mary Ann and Louie complain to their grandfather about sitting a neighbor's dog, he responds as he always does in Stevenson's books:  He offers them something cold (lemonade), and he reminisces about the time when he and his younger brother \\"Wainey\\" fed a neighbor's cat, gerbils, hamster, parakeet, turtle, rabbit and fish (and also watered her plants).  As he begins his story, Grandpa raises his eyebrows slightly, as if to signal the reader that what follows may not be entirely true.  Told in an extended flashback, his straight-on delivery of their wild adventure will delight toddlers and young children.<br /><br />The very young Grandpa and Wainey immediately have trouble. The snapping turtle snaps at Grandpa's hands, the gerbils and rabbit escape from their cages, the \\"cat\\" is actually at least 25 cats (some of them visitors), the plants fill an entire greenhouse, and Wainey gets knocked into the fish tank. Things were not working out.<br /><br />Louie asks Grandpa, \\"Did you and Wainey have to spend all day every day working there?\\"  Grandpa explains how he and Wainey (who once again, mutters the inexplicable \\"Wump\\") rigged up a Rube Goldberg-esque multi-animal feeding contraption out of cups and string.  However, when the cat plays with the strings, all the animals escape! Even Wainey gets wound up in the string, and in a hilarious series of pictures, young Grandpa pulls the string and \\"Wainey went spinning away like a top. He whirled through the house, crashing into things and bouncing off,\\" and he releases the animals again.. Somehow, a fortuitous Wainey collision sets things right just before the neighbors return.<br /><br />After Grandpa finished the story, \\"Uncle Wainey\\" comes over and explains to the children that he's leaving soon on vacation. Oh no! Will he ask them to sit a zoo-full of animals?  Longtime readers of this series know how the book concludes.  SPOILER AHEAD:  As usual, Wainey needs someone to... help him finish his ice cream!  Relying more on physical comedy, this book is not quite as outlandishly funny as those in which Grandpa's increasingly improbably story is ironically contrasted with his laconic, straight delivery.  Still, Stevenson's understated narrative, physical comedy (recalling that of silent movies), and action-filled illustrations are engaging and fit the slightly askew story.  There's just enough plausibility in Grandpa's tall tale that young ones, when they're not laughing, may wonder if it could have happened exactly the way he says.  Recommended, but you might want to look for other Stevenson books featuring Grandpa and Wainey.lying more on physical comedy, this book is not quite as outlandishly funny as those in which Grandpa's increasingly improbably story is ironically contrasted with his laconic, straight delivery.

That's where a usually quiet-loving, obedient dog starts a rampage through town, as well as where illustrator Teague moves from static interiors to imaginative, cotton candy exteriors. In these views, objects and  people are rounded and seemingly filled with Styrofoam, and the perspective is curved and distorted.  It's the  two dimensional equivalent of Disneyland's \\"Toon Town,\\" except that the late 1940's/early 50's style  is even more evident, more like the Disney kids' noir film, \\"Who Shot Roger Rabbit,\\" on which \\"Toon Town\\" is based.<br /><br />This story contains no sexy rabbits, however, Instead , it's the story of one sweet and  innocent dog who wreaks havoc in his little rounded hometown.  When the marshmallow-looking painters arrive to redo her owner's gingerbread house, Gracie the puppy goes through the forbidden front gate (also curved, and framed by flowers that look ready to sing), and she \\"decided to do something naughty. Gracie decided to take a walk-ALL BY HERSELF.\\"  When everyone comes outside to look for Gracie,  some canine instinct comes over her, and she begins to run, chased by painters, neighbors, boys and girls, and more and more townspeople (and even a bunny!). Gracie bounds into the curvy streets, under the billowy soap bubble skies, and takes off, tail wagging, tongue hanging and paws pounding. She leads the whole town--including the personified curving architecture-into screwball comedy territory.  Teague's acrylic illustrations are right on target; he draws this broadly, with action, clothes, and even people's stances right out of  central casting around 1943.<br /><br />I thought the conclusion was fittingly  zany as well. Gracie leaves the others behind as their feet and bicycles wear out, and \\"suddenly Gracie realized how quiet [italicized] everything was again...People were resting. How nice, Gracie thought. [next page]. So that silly little dog turned around and walked back home ALL BY HERSELF!\\" When she returns nonchalantly, the wiped out citizens seem astonished and amazed (one tired painter puts his palm against the side of his face, a little like Jack Benny).  While my enthusiasm my lead some to infer that this wacky book is one primarily for adult movie fans, the book's excitement and sense of naughty/innocent fun will appeal equally to children, both toddlers and young grade schoolers; all ages can appreciate Teague's artistic accomplishment. While  Szekere's (\\"The Nothing To Do Puppy,\\" and many other books) funny chase story builds an escalating stampede of  excitement, it's mostly the pictures that make this a keeper.onchalantly, the wiped out citizens seem astonished and amazed (one tired painter puts his palm against the side of his face, a little like Jack Benny).

The black and white illustrations (against an appealing silvery-white background) the clipped language, and the tough-guy stance all parody the \\"noir\\" films and books of the 1940's, and much of it is funny and clever. Unfortunately, Doug Cushman doesn't quite sustain the noir sensibility throughout the book, and the parody flattens somewhat after a promising beginning.<br /><br />The opening scene is taken from the Bogart version of \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\" Detective Nick Trunk, an elephant with a slight resemblance to Lee J. Cobb, encounters a pretty, fur-laden kitten in his office. While the private eye's digs aren't shabby enough, there's some angled reflection on the wall, and his client has some `lip' on her:<br /><br />\\"One morning, the door to my office opened. In walked a beautiful lady. She looked like trouble.<br /><br />`My name is Trouble,' she said. `Maggie Trouble. Are you Nick Trunk?\\"<br /><br />`That's my name,' I said.\\"<br /><br />Lola explains --in direct, short sentences-- a nicely convoluted story about how her employer, singer Lola Gale, lost her marbles. Real marbles (for good luck). Trunk replies \\"I will take your case,\\" but like any two-bit detective he wants his payment up front. The elephant works for peanuts. (He will settle for peanut brittle, however). Witty, clever, and smartly written satire.<br /><br />The authenticity begins to evaporate when Trunk meets Gale, who looks more like Ms. Dumont in the Marx Brothers movies than a femme fatale. She's staid-looking, with real pearls, and an upscale air. Opportunities for noirish illustrations and biting dialogue give way to a more pedestrian mystery exploring clues, questioning multiple suspects--and repeating jokes and puns about peanut butter. Only the chef (a bespeckled pig) and a walrus working at a diner look like character actors from the films this book tries to emulate. A few clues and an insight later, the mystery is solved, with a final page exploding with puns.<br /><br />Although Cushman's draws well, and he includes some interesting dialogue and characters, the spoof just doesn't feel authentic enough. A better satire would include and parody more noir elements in a manner that would appeal to a wider age range. Cushman does a good job with some of these ingredients: The snappy dialogue, the drawings of the pig, the walrus, and Lola, the contours of the diner, and, later, a more messy detective office. However, the lighting, the characters (especially Nick Trunk), the names, and much of the whole \\"look\\" and tone are not consistently authentic. Younger kids aren't going to get all of the film noir allusions without the help of an older reader. Therefore, the author--more so than in other books--has two audiences, kids and adults, and adults' knowledge of the genre should be satisfied. Still, the book is often snappy, and the kitchen and diner \\"scenes,\\" and Trunk (when drawn looking weary)fit the style. When the elements are there, there's the possibility of discussion with your younger audience.<br /><br />Generally speaking, the noir film/book parody is just too easy and overdone. It requires meticulous attention to the details, exploiting them in as many clever ways as possible. While I enjoyed the book, and kids will like the humor and the mystery, it was ultimately a bit disappointing. Note: As mentioned by others, the book is dedicated to \\"Sam, Phil,and Dashiell\\": Only the latter is a mystery writer, Sam and Phil refer, as fans know, to the fictional heroes Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe.diner look like character actors from the films this book tries to emulate.

The sheen engages you and the velvety textures soothe.  This is a small storybook for toddlers featuring the Landstrom's two sheep. This time out, \\"Boo and Baa are going to the woods to pick berries.\\"  The sheep seem prepared--they've studied a map of the woods--but when they get to the forest they can't find any berries.  \\"Can someone have picked them all?\\" Boo asks.<br /><br />They take a lunch break and Baa notices an ant on Boo's sandwich. One ant turns into scores of ants (\\"There are ants everywhere! Boo and Baa were sitting next to an anthill!\\"). and they flee to the creek.  Another challenge faces them as they figure out how to ford it. The book includes many of these discussion points for you and your toddler or kindergarten-aged kid: What would you bring on a berry-picking trip? Why do ants like picnics? How would you get over across a creek?  A very funny set of pictures shows Boo and Baa pole-vaulting over the river! Baa's pole gets stuck in the stream, but she spots a field of blueberries on the other side! The story has action and age-appropriate interest.  Although there's not a lot of humor, the story's action, age-appropriate relevancy, and lush, shaded forest (with details such as mushrooms, a frog, a pinecone, and the cleverly disguised anthill) are very appealing. Another simple story beautifully told and illustrated.	2005-05-24

Shakespeare knew it, and parents and other adults know it:  People love a comedy of errors. Perhaps the most delighted audience is the youngest; toddlers love hearing mistakes and correcting them.  It's a surefire hit for their certain sense of humor, and Sandra Boynton exploits this beautifully in this small board book.<br /><br />Just a few set-up lines and Boynton is ready for the book's main joke:<br /><br />\\"A cow says MOO.\\"<br /><br />\\"A sheep says BAA.\\"<br /><br />\\"Three singing pigs say LA LA LA!\\"<br /><br />\\"'No, no!' you say, 'that isn't right.<br /><br />The pigs say OINK all day and night.'\\"<br /><br />Practice your dramatic abilities and really ham it up (pun intended) when you read the singing pigs and \\"that isn't right\\" lines on pages 3 and 4. There's also some action (dogs chasing cats), and a nice quizzical conclusion: (\\"It's quiet now. What do you [underlined] say?\\")<br /><br />Boynton's familiar style is whimsical and slightly tongue-in-cheek. Her animals have very expressive, human-looking emotions, conveyed mostly through the eyes. For example, a quacking duck and a neighing horse aren't intrinsically very interesting, but when they're facing each other with similarly baffled faces, there's a subtle humor. The singing pigs, by the way, are anything but subtle. They're pizzazed out in coordinating striped pants, solid sports coats, and elegant white bow ties. They excited pigs dance in unison and hold canes in a showy vaudeville style. For a short and simple board book aimed at the very young, this is lots of fun.  For older toddlers, take a look at Boynton's counting book with a difference: \\"Hippos Go Berserk!\\"  She knows and loves her animals, and so will your little one.	2005-05-23

After all, he played John Alden in the Thanksgiving play and takes weekly tap dance lessons. However, Peter's excited and repeated classroom whispers annoy his teacher:<br /><br />\\"Since you cannot pay attention, you will not play Peter Rabbit.\\" (Ouch!)<br /><br />\\"You will be Mopsy!\\" \\"But Mopsy is a girl bunny!\\" Tommy said.<br /><br />(Double Ouch!)  \\"Not in our play...\\"<br /><br />Tommy seems to take ths setback professionally. He remembers that what his tapdance instructor told him: Onstage performers should react to what their fellow performers do. FOr example, if they do something funny, act like a member of the audience and laugh.<br /><br />However, Tommy overdoes it during \\"Peter Rabbit.\\"  In veteran author/illustrator Tomie De Paola's acrylic illustrations, Tommy looks so surprised, sad, sick, etc. that he's basically just mugging for his young audience, and they eat it up. His teacher smilingly tells Tommy he's a ham; However, his mom informs him that he stole the show. He is to tell Johnny (who played Peter) and the teacher that he is sorry, and he does. He pauses and seems to agree. However, in a too-quick conclusion, Tommy remembers the audience's attention and applause, and he can hardly wait to get back onstage.<br /><br />That's it?  As portrayed in the book, Tommy's apologies seem perfunctory and with insufficient comprehension. His teacher is both too stern and too forgiving; she doesn't respond appropriately to Tommy's unintentional scene stealing.  And Tommy, who's only five and did not act (it appears, anyway) maliciously, is treated punitively rather than with empathy and a focus on understanding.  The story is too shallow, with one subplot about a shy girl in the play, and the adult \\"voice\\" (the \\"message\\") is confusing.  Illustrations are pleasant and colorful, but, like the story, they lack complexity and dimension.they lack complexity and dimension.	2005-05-23

Those who want a humorous book based on the \\"THe Simpsons\\" will love it; but those who want something more true to the TV show's presentation will ultimately feel some disappontment. As I read through the opening town history  (recounting city founder \\"Jedidiah Obediah Zachariah Obediah Springfield) and quickly advanced to typical tourist guide chapters such as attractions, where to eat (and especially, to drink), city events, etc., I enjoyed the mix of pointed social and political satire, idiosyncratic cast, and implied or retold story lines that have made \\"The Simpsons\\" probably one the truely great animated shows (as well as comedies, period). THe book is a condensed reminder of favorite settings (much more so than episodes), and the entire Springfield gestalt: crooked politicians, inept police, the polluting nuclear plant, and the wide spectrum of schemes hatched by both boy and father Simpson.<br /><br />However, it increasingly became evident that this was not a history according to \\"The Simpsons\\"; rather, many elements had been embellished or simply made up just for this book.  In a way, it's the same kind of anything-for-money cynicism that pervades the show, and one can't help but feeling some admiration for the guile of the author(s). (I could be wrong, but I assume it's written by a staff of writers under Groening's name.)<br /><br />Purists will have mixed feelings about the book's inventions, especially when they don't match the spirit and the wit of the show. For example, Lisa is relatively absent, her brother seems more like a delinquent than the loveable ten-year-old semi-innocent persona in the show, and the essential qualities of people such as Ned Flanders, Moe, Mr. Burns, and many others are never truely captured. As a fan, I felt entertained yet somehow taken.

Books	5	48	50	N	N	A Board Book of Epic Proportion	The most entertaining \\"counting book,\\" I've seen, Sandra Boynton pulls out all the stops (and all the hippos) in this hilariously inventive tale of a hippo happening. It all beings with one lonely hippo, who \\"calls two hippos on the phone. Three hippos at the door [then, next page] bring along another 4. Before long, \\"seven hippos arrive in  a sack. Eight hippos sneak in the back. Nine hippos come to work. ALL THE HIPPOS GO BERSERK!\\" Berserk here, means 45 hippos (9 + * + & ... + 1) all in the initial hippo's house, tooting horns, tearing down a hippo portrait (drawn like Whistler's mother, if Whistler were a hippo), eating cake, and being served by those nine working hippos. When morning comes, the hippos leave, in as many different ways as they arrived: By \\"Greyhip\\" bus, wagon train (!),  helicopter, and wheelbarrow.<br /><br />We've come to expect Boynton's wonderfully whimsical, rounded style, but she adds several humorous details (e.g. a hippo dancing on the roof), and very cleverly associates the numbers with the hippos.  Most counting books are very static, a number, say 5, and five of some item on that page.  I suppose a more \\"advanced\\" presentation is that the numbers are related in some thematic way. However, Boynton doesn't limit herself to the one page per number formula; she writes a continuous story, in which new guests-the ones associated with that page's number--mingle with previous arrivals. She accomplishes this by distinguishing the new, number-relevant guests through their costumes or by color differences. This format may require more cognitively than simpler books, but Boynton's \\"Hippos GO Berserk\\" is so entertaining that it stands alone as pure entertainment; its value \\"counts\\" much more than the traditional style.	2005-05-23

He's not distressed by this penchant; it's just his way.  However, Wallace adheres so strictly to his lists that they're somewhat maladaptive; for example, he seems intrigued by his new mustachioed neighbor Albert, but Wallace doesn't greet him. Why?  Because he hadn't put 'greeting a new neighbor' on his list.  Somewhere Wallace didn't quite get the balance between structure and spontaneity. In contrast, Albert is a free spirit with a Zen-like knack for living in the moment. His spontaneity (as well as his slightly bohemian apartment) baffles Wallace:<br /><br />\\"'Changing my mind is an adventure,' Albert explained. `I don't like adventures,' said Wallace. `An adventure can be anything. Anything that isn't planned for.'  `You mean anything that isn't on a list?' asked Wallace.  `Exactly!' said Albert.\\" For some reason, Wallace then asks, \\"Do you ever use a map?\\" and Albert paraphrases a famous line from the film, \\"The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai:\\"  \\"I don't need maps...because wherever I go, there I am.\\"<br /><br />Albert, however, doesn't always plan things very well.  When he drills a hole to hang a picture, he leaves a big gaping hole as goes all the way through the wallpaper to the brick wall. Luckily, Albert isn't fazed; he covers the whole with a brick.  Wallace gets a case of the \\"What ifs\\" at Albert's casual attitude towards adventure (\\"But what if you get lost?\\"). Albert answers with a certain joie de vivre (\\"Being lost is automatically an adventure\\"). While their stances are diametrically opposed, Albert exhibits a fond acceptance of Wallace.<br /><br />Before you can say \\"Odd Couple,\\" the two rodents are on the road to friendship, and plan a trip to Glockamorra together.  Wallace hopes that none of the things from his \\"Things I hate\\" list will happen there: 1. Rain streaming down my glasses. 2. Sand in my shoe. 3. Being hot. 4. Being cold. 5. Being wet), and honest Al admits, \\"at least one of those things might happen if you went to Glockamorra.\\" The next morning, Wallace wakes up from nightmare and discovers two important and unplanned things:  1. Since Wallace didn't answer his door, Albert has already gone to the airport, and, 2) a \\"dangerous storm\\" with \\"torrents of water\\" had started, and Wallace needed to warn Albert. (It is not at all clear why Albert, an apparently experienced pilot, needs any warning, but the plot must go on).<br /><br />Now the real adventure, and an amazing display of friendship, begins. Wallace is all unlisted action as he goes to warn Albert. Moreover, he finds that he must stray from his own avowed \\"Things I hate\\" list:  Rain streams down his glasses, he gets wet, and it looks like he gets cold.  He faces other dangers (e.g., a cat) with aplomb. When he finally finds Albert, soaked and disappointed, he remembers his \\"How To Cheer Up Your Pals\\" list.  Albert, for his part, takes Wallace on a madcap adventure at the airport and in the city, and Wallace discovers his previously submerged sense of humor and spontaneity.  He doesn't give up list making-no one makes that demand-but the contents of his lists change.  He writes about his adventures (his longest list ever), and, in perhaps his shortest list ever, he write down the name of his best friend.<br /><br />This touching book shows that opposites not only attract, but can also complement each other. Albert and Wallace show an endearing mutual acceptance, and one feels that a bit of Albert's personality has rubbed off on Wallace (although it's not clear whether the converse is true.) These are valuable qualities at any age, and authors Bottner and Kruglik make it seem natural and unforced.  Olof Landstrom's Euro-look illustrations also lighten the book: They have the color and action of the famous Tintin series, an offhand jokey style, and a certain majesty in the panoramas.  Some of the clean-lined interiors and architecture exude a modern, somewhat Scandinavianfeeling.  In addition, Landstrom varied perspectives echo the book's theme about taking multiple viewpoints.  This is a funny and warm book, both entertaining and socially educational.  Highly recommended.Scandinavian feeling.

In Lynne Cravath's colorful illustration, swirling images pour from Crowboy as he lies awake, scared and worried.  What can one young boy do to face the imagined onslaught?  Like so many kids, he takes on a new persona, a protective, \\"tough\\" image:<br /><br />\\"So when Crowboy woke up, he decided to become a snake.  Not just any old snake-a mean old rattle snake with very sharp teeth.  He crawled downstairs to eat breakfast in one smooth slither.\\"<br /><br />Cravath draws him as a snake--a fearsome snake with big eyes and a long red tongue. On the bus, the snake scares the kids by wrapping himself around their legs (in a nice touch, the words wrap around the page too). It turns out that this isn't an entirely successful coping style, for some of the kids scream and try to kick him. But the boy rationalizes this away: \\"Crowboy didn't mind. Snakes are used to kicks and screams.\\"<br /><br />This is one scared boy heading for trouble, even if he thinks his snakedom makes him a safe outcast.  He won't sing, and he pretends to bite some potential friends. However, when one disarming girl with big eyes and a kind heart befriends him, shows that she's not afraid, and even accepts his snake status (in a great picture that combines weird, \\"ugly,\\" yet friendly images, Cravath shows the bagful of oddly shaped worms and insects that the girl brought for Crowboy's lunch!).  Though Crowboy rejects the rattlesnake lunch, he accepts her offer of friendship-and he sheds his snakeskin. They agree that they'll be snakes together, although the last page shows them as boy and girl happily climbing a play structure.<br /><br />Although the girl is too idealized, and the resolution too quick, this books shows (rather than lectures) how kids adopt different fronts to hide their real feelings.  I liked the example of a girl and boy befriending each other, and the girl's implicit understanding and acceptance. While the story is thin, and fairly one-dimensional, Cravath's imaginative pictures and convincing use of local color highlight the book.

236721:US	49600435	RD36HLOJMCL8S	0689873999	209881335	Ella's Big Chance: A Jazz-Age Cinderella (Kate Greenaway Medal)	Books	5	23	23	N	N	A Book Right Out of the Golden Age of Movies-Sensational!	Knowing that this Cinderella-themed book won the \\"Kate Greenaway Medal for Children's Illustration,\\" I decided to look at the illustration before reading the text.  I was looking for authenticity and creativity in the pictures, as well as a hint of the story to come.  I'm also a fan of jazz, and although the music isn't synonymous with the \\"age,\\" I was curious to see whether author/illustrator Shirley Hughes incorporated any musical elements.<br /><br />It didn't take long to discover the sweep and style of the 1920's, for Hughes' 2-page opening title shows a glossy ballroom floor, inhabited by a small jazz band, self-assured men in tuxedoes and tails, fashionable women in full length gowns (plunging either in front or back), and a white-coated \\"manservant\\" offering martinis.  (Zelda, we have arrived!) As the story begins, pictures show the middle and under classes, and the scornful looks of the social \\"betters.\\"  The latter are dressed in chiffon, feathers, fancy hats, and jewelry, and a man sports a pinstripe suit with a rose boutonni&egrave;re and impeccable black and white spats. You can sense the texture of their clothes, just as you can feel the conflicting attitudes of the haves and have-nots. I cheated and looked at the endpaper:  The rich colors come from gouache, accented and shaded with pen. In addition (and, as noted by another reviewer), Hughes' original dress designs were inspired by 1920's French couture; her ballroom scenes by the d&eacute;cor and set designs of the glorious RKO-produced Astaire/Rogers musicals. The book's remaining pictures convey emotion (especially in cinematic-like close-ups), dramatic lighting, subtle and grand action, and swirls of gorgeous, opulent color.  Hughes captures the look of money and the face of disenfranchisement with equal magnificence.<br /><br />OK, so I'm completely sold on the pictures. What about the story?  As you may have gathered, the Cinderella here is \\"Ella Cinder,\\" a comely woman who's an expert helper in her father's dress shop.  When she can, she laughs with almost- boyfriend \\"Buttons.\\" As for the scornful women mentioned above, they're her dad's new wife (Cinder's stepmother) and her daughters (the stepsisters!).  The stepmother takes over running the shop, the stepsisters model, lounge about, and call Cinder names, and Cinder herself has to work harder than ever.  Mr. Cinders is a broken man in this power play, and he can do nothing to help his daughter.<br /><br />Buttons, however, scrappy American that he is, \\"stays on the job for [Cinder's] sake.\\" \\"Privately he called the [stepsisters] a couple of puffed-up, made-up, stuck-up, brainless parakeets.\\" He also plays his guitar\\" in Ella's ratty basement room, and sometimes, \\"they even danced together...moving softly in and out among the bales of cotton.\\"  This is pure literary magic, Hughes' words and pictures mesh like a slow dance; they're consistently evocative and note-perfect.<br /><br />I'll now cut to the chase of this modernized (to a point) fairy tale: An elite ball is planned, and the stepsisters scoff at the neglected Cinder. Very soon, however, an efficient yellow-hatted woman with a purple umbrella (her wand, it turns out) does her magic, and Ella turns into the Queen of the Jazz Age, the Belle of the Ball, and the Delight of the Duke who dances with her. Hughes wisely keeps the stroke of twelve and missing slipper motifs, but like any good 1920's film, Ella turns down the rich duke for her true love, Buttons, who can promise only his winning and constant love, a dream of owning their own shop, and his famous bacon and eggs.  This book from 2003 is a complete delight, excelling in every conceivable way, and it's hard to imagine any child (or adult) not enjoying and treasuring it immensely.<br /><br />Note: The book is so cinematic in illustration, plot, and dialogue, that I'm already having fun casting a hypothetical \\"movie\\": Perhaps director Frank Capra (or George Cukor) would insist on a dulled-down Carole Lombard as \\"Cinder\\"; Stewart , Cagney, or a relatively new, \\"nice guy\\" actor as \\"Buttons,\\" and S.Z. \\"Cuddles\\" Sakall or Lionel Barrymore as the beleaguered father.  Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell would reprise their cat-fighting roles from \\"The Women,\\" with Katherine Hepburn (cast against type) or Bette Davis as the (wicked) stepmother, and Franchot Tone or Leslie Howard as romantically tragic Duke. Indulge yourself as I did, and buy this book for a child, and, especially, for yourself.own Carole Lombard as \\"Cinder\\"; Stewart , Cagney, or a relatively new, \\"nice guy\\" actor as \\"Buttons,\\" and S.Z. \\"Cuddles\\" Sakall or Lionel Barrymore as the beleaguered father.

Peggy Rathmann is the author and illustrator of \\"Goodnight Gorilla-her masterpiece-as well as several other highly acclaimed books (e.g., \\"Officer Buckle and Gloria,\\" \\"The Day the Babies Crawled Away\\").  This book combines a number of familiar motifs: Animals that may or may not be imaginary (visible only to the boy protagonist, but not to his father), counting between 1 and 10, lots of detailed background activity, self-referential humor, fantasy spinning off of the mundane, and an exciting conclusion hinging on whether the boy will get to bed on time.<br /><br />The surface plot is simple:  A father immersed in his paper (with humorous stories on it) announces that it's 10 minutes until the boy's bedtime, and counts down the remaining time each minute.  Rathmann takes it much further than this though.  For some reason, the boy's real hamster advertises a \\"10-minute bedtime tour\\" in the local paper. The hamsters arrival coincides with the 10-minutes in which the boy must get ready for bed.  For the rest of the story, the pet hamster echoes the father's countdown, and the guest hamsters follow the boy around as he brushes his teeth, goes on the \\"potty,\\" reads a story, etc.  The echoes reverberate like two facing mirrors. Not only do the hamsters recapitulate the father and son's activities, but also the boy becomes his own doppelganger.  He's shown reading a book--this book, \\"10 Minutes Till Bedtime.\\"  On page 22 (four minutes to go), you see him looking over his chair at the scores of newly arrived hamsters in his bedroom, holding this book turned to page 22.  More and more hamsters arrive, practically filling the bathtub, and they cluster in groups dancing in hulas, laying in deck chairs, water-skiing, and boating.  The whole book seems close to exploding with hamster tourists, until a gigantic shout of \\"Bedtime!\\" shakes them off the rafters and out of the house.<br /><br />This is an ambitious book with mixed results. The illustrations are wonderful, luminous (including the signature lamppost), colorful, and with good separation of foreground and background. Rathmann's pictures of the ever-increasing hamsters are convincing, and their adaptation of human activities (traveling in campers made out of oatmeal boxes, taking pictures, riding a toy train, etc.) is funny and recognizable despite the miniature scale.  Still, it's a very busy book, and the crescendo of hamster-mania is not exactly calming (although the humor is).  It's also a bit difficult to explain how this all happens.  You can either go with the \\"it's just his imagination\\" angle, or you can say these are things that only children can see, or you can just ignore plausibility  altogether and hope your child does too.  What's somewhat more annoying is Rathmann's self-referential humor, especially the commercialization of the gorilla from \\"Goodnight Gorilla.\\"  If fantasies are inherently valuable, then why must we see the gorilla become the doll property of the boy. Moreover, the drawings of this book inside the book also seem unnecessary and contrived.  In a way, this repeated product placement feels more like more self-promotion than the clever or sly touches for which Ms. Rathmann is famous.<br /><br />Overall, if your child enjoys abstract fantasy, animals, and slightly busy books with lots of tiny activities on every page, this book may become a favorite. For me, none of her books rivals the simple, wry humor of \\"Goodnight, Gorilla.\\" However, Rathmann challenges both herself and her readers with this very interesting excursion.  Slightly older kids (say, early elementary school age may enjoy the \\"Sims\\"-like quality of the scurrying hamsters, and others may enjoy the \\"Where's Waldo\\" detail.  There's no trouble finding `Waldo' here: The real or imagined hamsters are here, there, and almost everywhere.

This appealing little book is an early effort by prolific author/illustrator David McPhail.  Although the colors seem somewhat muddied (I have a copy published much earlier than the one available from Amazon.com), and McPhail's illustrations perhaps not his best, there is an unmistakable \\"McPhail look\\" to the bodies and faces that he draws.  The book has a great opening:  A young boy in bed hears a giant \\"OOOOOO\\" outside his window, the `0's floating through the dark sky like a train of fluorescent cheerios. He looks out his window to discover its source: \\"It was a bear [the sentence continues on the next page] with a toothache.<br /><br />In typical McPhail fashion, the unusual and the impossible become the ordinary.  This is a large part of the book's humor and excitement:  \\"I invited him in [next page] and examined his teeth.\\"  The boy's efforts to extract the hurting tooth results in much bearish behavior, and that spells minor disasters in the small house (e.g., the bear eats all the food; a lamp is broken). The boy's father gets involved, but only briefly:<br /><br />\\"'What happened to the lamp?' he asked.<br /><br />`It fell on the floor,' I answered.<br /><br />`Oh,' he said, and he went back to bed.\\"<br /><br />McPhail wisely makes this a private relationship between bear and boy only; there are no adults to negotiate or help.  In this way, the little boy acts like a much bigger boy, and kids will appreciate this touch. The low-tech, crosshatched illustrations also add to the book's intimacy. There's a successful resolution (it archetypal pre-dentist fashion, the bear's tooth is tied to a rope...), and \\"The Bear's Toothache\\" concludes in the same unassuming manner in which it began. A fun book for small fry, although it appears that (in my older edition) the color reproduction doesn't quite meet the usual high standards of Greenwillow Publishing. Still, highly recommended!	2005-05-13

The mustachioed, wild-shirted dad decides to turn his son into a pizza!<br /><br />Dad takes Pete through all the right motions: Kneading the \\"dough\\" (a great backrub!), stretching it (yoga!), and twirling it in the air (don't try this at home!).  Steig draws the dad adding oil (\\"It's really water.\\"), and flour (\\"It's really talcum powder.\\"), and tomatoes (\\"They're really checkers.\\") on top of Pete. \\"Pete can't stop giggling when his mother [who's been mostly quiet up till now] says she doesn't like tomatoes on her pizza.\\"<br /><br />Pete plays along, staying appropriately quiet (he's a pizza, after all), until his mom's well placed tickle elicits more giggles. His dad mock-admonished Pete: \\"Pizzas are not supposed to laugh,\\" but the quick-witted Peter retorts,\\" Pizza Makers are not supposed to tickle their pizzas!\\" When Dad announces it's time to slice the pizza (!), Pete runs off.  His dad catches him and gives him a big hug, the rain stops, and the story, based on a game Mr. Steig used to play with his daughter, comes to a happy conclusion.  Maybe families don't always operate in such big-hearted, well-coordinated ways, but it's nice to have such a wonderful model.  The font is all in CAPITOL LETTERS, making this a great beginning reader's book. The warmth, humor, and fun pretend play make this yet another great book by William Steig.	2005-05-13

Although only a couple of words actually rhyme, James Stevenson's rhythms, word choices, and formatting, convey the feeling and cadence of poetry. The book is short on excitement, but young ones will enjoy practicing their reading with this old-fashioned, nicely illustrated story.<br /><br />Mr. Hacker no longer knows his city: The neighbors are now strangers, and the things are noisy, dirty, or broken-down. He moves, but his new location is too quiet and too isolated, and he begins to wonder whether he made the right decision.  However, Mr. Hacker makes friends-animal friends!  A brown dog and a yellow cat begin to compete for the food he lays out for them.  The dog (in one of the more humorous passages) wins, eating both the dog food and the cat food, but Mr. Hacker loses his temper. Eventually, with patient training and increasing affection for the animals, all is in order again, but the situation repeats itself when the squirrels eat the birdseed Mr. Hacker leaves out!<br /><br />This is a quiet book about making a home for yourself. There's very little plot and not much conflict, but Mr. Hacker's slow accommodation to his surroundings (echoed by the two animals acceptance of Mr. Hacker) is warm and reassuring. Mr. Hacker's initial anger with the food-stealing dog subsides, and one gets the feeling that they've forged a real friendship together. The watercolor and black pen illustrations resemble those of Stevenson, but they are by Frank Modell, whose style will be familiar to \\"New Yorker\\" readers. They convey the emotions in a book where emotion plays an important role.	2005-05-13

Nicole Rubel, one of my favorite illustrator/authors (\\"Cyrano the Bear,\\" \\"A Cowboy Named Ernestine\\") draws busy backgrounds, reflecting Rotten Ralph's frenetic activity to keep Sarah from returning to school.  It's not that the cat dislikes school; he just wants Sarah all to himself. The time-tested slapstick humor is very easy to understand.  Ralph gives Sarah some trick soap and her newly washed face turns orange. Just behind her, so that all is perfectly clear, we see Ralph smiling mischievously, holding a package labeled \\"orange trick soap.\\"<br /><br />Ralph's sabotage is not subtle. He draws his face on Sarah's first-day-of-school clothes (and looks only slightly sorry when Sarah angrily informs him \\"that's not nice...\\").  He covers his face with whopped cream for that sick \\"foaming at the mouth\\" look.  \\"Ralph,\\" Sarah said with a smile, \\"you look strange, but you'll be alright.\\"<br /><br />When Sarah finally gets away and arrives at school. Ralph follows in a very unconvincing outfit (he doesn't cover his tail, for one thing!).  Ralph's pranks just keep on coming. Some antics are right out of old comics and movies (e.g., tying Sarah's shoelaces together), but also show some malevolent imagination (putting stinky fish bones in Sarah's lunch, again depriving Sarah of the chance to make a new friend). Author Jack Gatos' dialogue is realistic, and Ralph's tricks are both silly and clever. Nicole Rubel's illustrations also help keep the humor fresh and interesting.  She shows wide-eyed emotion, adds lots of action and detail, and uses vibrant colors.  The foreshortened perspective increases the action, and brings Sarah and Rotten Ralph to the foreground.<br /><br />Eventually Rotten Ralph's plan to isolate and conquer fails, but Ralph seems to enjoy new friends just as much as Sarah does.  Sarah understands, in a way that Ralph probably won't, that his mean tricks are a convoluted way of expressing his love for her.  This book is not only very funny and well illustrated, but it shows some complex friendship issues in an understandable, non-preachy way.  Slightly older toddlers and early grade schoolers will relate to the feeling of wanting a friend all to one's self, and you can explore feelings and possible solutions with them.

Eric Hill's irrepressible Spot experiences both the joys and pangs of sleepovers in this winning book.<br /><br />When Spot's playmate Steve the monkey invites him to a sleepover at his house next door, his Mom Sally says yes, and Spot begins packing as if he's going away for a week.  The two buddies have fun sliding down Steve's new slide (although Spot crashes in to the yellow flowers) and swinging on a tire.  But then, while it's still daytime, Spot's mother comes over with a mysterious pink bag. Later during bedtime, curious Steve asks, \\"What was in the bag, Spot?\\"  Spot, inside his sleeping bag with the teddy bear his mom brought over (and a big smile on his face ) replies simply, \\"Oh, nothing.\\"  Spot has a good time and thanks Sally for remembering to bring the bear over.<br /><br />Overall, the book has a nice uncluttered feeling, with big bold text and bright illustrations. Unfortunately, some of the flaps (which hide objects until your audience lifts them) had been torn away.  This is a fairly common occurrence with \\"flap books,\\" so please don't be surprised if an infant or young child similarly lifts with a bit too much experience.  Like a great sleepover, the book is simultaneously exciting and reassuring.	2005-05-07

While the latter book fulfills the title's promise by showing animals and animal body parts in their actual size, this book shows them in 1:8 scale; that is, the animals are drawn accurately, but 1/8 smaller than actual size.  Although many of the two books' animals are the same, and Jenkins again contrasts large and small animals for contrast and wonder, \\"Big and Little\\" is simply not as fascinating as \\"Actual Size.\\"<br /><br />Unlike \\"Actual Size,\\" \\"Big and Little\\" shows most of the animals in their entirety. Once doesn't get the \\"WOW\\" factor of looking straight into a close-up of giant squid's eyes or a shark's mouth.  Big and Little relies greatly on the contrasting sizes of animal pairs on two-page spread ; for example,  a Siberian tiger and a Siamese cat, an ostrich and a hummingbird, a cat shark and a great white shark.  While Jenkins uses the cut-paper collages of \\"Actual Size,\\" he seems more timid here; the animal hides and skins are less textured and the color schemes more conventional.  Jenkins again includes brief descriptions of each animal pictured in the book, but they are shorter and not as interesting as in his latter book.<br /><br />If \\"Actual Size\\" had never been written I'd give this a higher rating; with his new book Jenkins has set a higher standard for himself and other writers.  The main advantages of \\"Big and Little\\" are the lower price and the relatively more simple pictures that may be more comprehensible than \\"Actual Size\\"  to very young toddlers or infants.  Aside from that, I strongly recommend his newer book over this one.	2005-05-07

These elements, along with some adventure, humor, and the loveable yellow Spot make this an appealing book for young audiences and beginning readers.<br /><br />After his mom, Sally, warns Spot to watch out on his journey, Spot's first walk results in surprises (often hidden under the flaps), mildly dangerous situations (a cat snarls at the young, innocent Spot), new scents (colorful garden populated by a butterfly and two bees, and new friends. In the denouement, a fish (under a flap) warns Spot not to fall into the pond from which he is about to drink.  The next page shows a soaked, but safe Spot heading back home. In another nice humorous touch, Sally asks Spot what he's been doing.

Instead, there is very little context about Native American (or Indian, if you prefer) life, the relationships among the tribes and the white explorers/invaders, and the Thomas Jefferson's motivation for conquest that motivated and funded the Lewis and Clark expedition.<br /><br />Relationships are mentioned but not explored. How was Sacagawea \\"given in marriage\\" to the white fur trapper, was it consensual; for that matter, were such marriages ever consensual?  Why did Lewis and Clark have such affection for her son, nicknamed \\"Pompy,\\" and what was the meaning of the nickname?\\" Was Sacagawea especially resourceful, or were her talents fairly typical for a female Shoshone?<br /><br />Of course, this is a book for kids, and we can't expect mature psychologically-oriented portrayals. Still, the author aims her book for a somewhat older audience (perhaps older elementary and junior high), and she doesn't spare factual details. What's missing, perhaps, are the kind of details that help an audience identify emotionally with the protagonist. At one point, Sacagawea, as interpreter, attends a meeting with Lewis and Clark and the Shoshone chief:<br /><br />\\"But when she looked at the face of the Shoshone chief, she burst into tears. He was her brother, Cameahwait! Sacagawea jumped up, threw her blanket over her brother, and wept!Cameahwait was moved, too. But the council had to continue. Though tears kept flooding back. Sacagawea kept to her duty until the council ended.\\"<br /><br />Howver, we don't learn what happened after the council ended. Perhaps no one knows. Still, we are told that something happened when the council was over--why bring it up if it just ends abruptly?  THe narrative skips is too episodic, and doesn't delve sufficiently into the personalities (we think, ), or the magnitude of their journey. Still, one does get an appreciation for this skilled and  relatively independent woman. At least, we think she is highly independent, since there is no explantion of women's roles. KIdnapped by a rival tribe, forced (or not?) into marriage and a long journey (how many miles and years?), and persuaded (coerced?) into leaving her son with Clark for a white man's education, Sacagawea's is a fascinating story that is not adequately told here.<br /><br />Fortunately, the book's spirited oil paintings, heavy with texture from the painters knife, yet fluid and with pastel chalk shadings draw us into \\"Sacagawea.\\"  There's also a one-page afterward explaining Sacagawea post-Lewis and Clark (the details are conflicting), a somewhat cursory map, a timeline linked to the story's events (rather than other significant dates), and a bibilography for those interesting in learning more. Beautiful and somewhat unusual illustrations by Julie Buffalohead, and an occasionally exciting narrative make this book a satisfactory starting place to about the culture and history of the era.we think she is highly independent, since there is no explantion of women's roles.

Bottle Houses tells the true story of Grandma Prisbey, artist, collector, and builder.  Although not as famous as Simon Rhodia of Watts Tower fame, she similarly constructed edifices out of discarded glass and other objects.  Her creative urge led to a whole complex of varied structures, united by the use of found objects. As Grandma Prisbey said, \\"What some people throw away, I believe I could wear to church.\\"  Unfortunately for her-and for us-some of the buildings were damaged by the 1994 quake in Simi Valley, California; however, much remains, and there is a \\"Preserve Bottle Village Committee\\" working to restore the Village.<br /><br />Melissa Slaymaker does a superb job of drawing us into the story. Right away, she describes Prisbey's, nonconformity, and independence: \\"...she didn't have a house. She was too busy to have one.\\" \\"Grandma Prisbrey had some land in California, but she didn't have enough money to build a house in a regular way. But Grandma Prisbey wasn't the sort of person who did things in a regular sort of way.\\"<br /><br />Prisbey went to the local dump, using \\"what some people throw away\\" including \\"furniture, stoves, refrigerators, dishes, clothes, batteries....even dolls. Hundreds of dolls.\\"<br /><br />The most important of these junked items were the colored bottles. Using everything but milk bottles (apparently against the law) she stacked bottles atop each other and held them in pace with cement.  With these as her basic building materials, she built  bottle houses for her collections of pencils and dolls, a bottle chapel, bottle birdbath, wishing well, rumpus room, and the round house (\\"everything in it was round.  It had a round fireplace, a round bed, and a round dresser with a round mirror over it.\\" Other creative projects include a house of shells and a \\"singing tree,\\" hung with thousands of bottles that rang like chimes.  She built a pyramid out to headlights and 150 gold lipstick cases, and dyed her three cats (vegetable dye is supposedly safe) pink, green, and blue! Slaymaker and Paschkis portray Grandma Prisbey as an artist without formal training or conventional drawing talent, who still created beautiful, original, works that delight the eye and express her individuality.<br /><br />The bright illustrations and decorative \\"folkish\\" art designs by illustrator Julie Paschkis add greatly to Slaymaker's text. Paschkis captures the luminosity of the colored glass bottles, using shading and reflection in her gouache illustrations. Other illustrations are reminiscent of old stencil patterns and mid-20th century graphics. Paschkis scattered her drawings over the page, yet they retain a uniform style, echoing the feeling and look of Prisbey's Bottle Village. Colors have unusual and beautiful hues, and Paschkis conveys the vivid, multi-colored mosaics accurately and with flair.

Looking through this oversized (about 10.25 by 12.25 inches on the outside) picture book is an eye-popping, dazzling  experience. Steve Jenkins shows a variety of animals and animal body parts at their actual size.  This alone is a great idea for a children's book, but Jenkins takes it further.  Like a movie director,  Jenkins varies his \\"shots\\" for maximal effect, moving, for example, from am entire pygmy mouse on one page, to much a Siberian tiger's face on the following two-page spread.  It's not only a visual contrast, but an emotional one too; the mouse looks out innocently at the reader, while the tiger does what tigers sometimes do: Growl!  You can feel--and then measure--the intense 1-½ inch eyes, and the two  2 ¼ inch fangs.<br /><br />Although most of the pictures take up two pages, Jenkins varies the animals, as well as how \\"close\\" they appear to the reader: HE begins with the largest butterfly (with a 12 inch wingspan), then contrasts this with a close-up of the eye of a giant squid.  The WOW fact is just as big.  In fact, it's so riveting that you might not see the smallish fish (the goby, 1/3 of an inch long) just opposite the butterfly.  Termites are dwarfed by the two-foot tongue of their predator, the giant anteater. The picture consists of a  15-inch snout and a two-foot pink tongue, covered with four small termites.  Here's a good question to ask your readers: How do you draw a two-foot tongue on a two-page spread that measures not quite 20 inches long?  By making it curl around.  The book is full of such opportunities for wide-eyed talk.  A foot long spider  (the \\"giant birdeater tarantula,\\" with 12 inch legs, and a fantastic name) is followed by a three-page foldout of a crocodile. \\" What do they eat?  People, among other things.<br /><br />After a very brief introduction, Jenkins names each animal and notes the more amazing size facts: The great white shark (all you can see is the top of its enormous mouth) , for example, is 21 feet long, weighs 3 tons, and has 4-inch long teeth.  Jenkins uses collages of torn paper and excellent coloring to portray realistic textures and evoke emotion. It's a masterful turn at graphic representation, and there's a refreshing lack of sentimentality in the pictures. The book's last four pages depict all of the animals in their entirety, with  a more detailed description of size, habitat, diet, and anything else that is interesting or amazing. Kids and adults will enjoy the enormous-feeling pictures, the diverse perspectives, as well as animal facts geared at multiple age levels.

255378:US	49600435	R1OF0DDEWY7HB	0399238964	288199229	Hep Cat	Books	4	3	4	N	N	3 1/2*  Great Pictures, but Story Seems Contrived	The problem with \\"Hepcat\\" is that William Bramhall's narrative isn't nearly as original as his ink and watercolor illustrations, and his use rock icons seems designed more to promote book sales rather than to further the integrity of his story.  Hepcat is a musician whom we never really get to know.  He's famous--he has a sold out concert at large theatre--, but he's inexplicably nervous. His personality is otherwise unknown to us.  He seems to favor beat clothes, but we don't know what kind of musician he is; the charts on his piano and the twenty (or so) piece band at the end suggest some kind of jazz. He's just a nervous cat with beat language and clothes, and there's little with which to empathize.<br /><br />Hepcat (so anxious he can't even practice) gets inspiration from beneath the stage floorboard. Here he finds four beetles, with the faces of The Beatles, playing music and advising him (in a slight revision of the lyrics to \\"Hey Jude\\"): \\"Hey, dude, don't make it bad...\\"Take a sad song and make it better.\\" One of them explains, \\"Just cruise the scene, man... Music is EVERYwhere.\\"  This provides the motivation for the remainder of the story, as Hepcat realizes that music, indeed, is everywhere-in city sounds and in nature.  That initial shot of the Beatles (even though Bramhall calls them beetles, they have the Beatles faces) as insects is a bit of a shock.  Drawn with actual beetle shells and legs, it's as if we're back in the early 1960's when people had the two names confused.  It's an old joke.  He appropriates their images, but has then talking in two entirely different vernaculars, their actual words (from \\"Hey Jude\\") and the story's need for \\"beat language.\\"<br /><br />The book never acknowledges or names the real figures that Hepcat encounters (e.g., the Beatles, Elvis, an unseen Chuck Berry, and Little Richard), yet there's a three-paragraph legal warning about the author's rights on the book's frontispiece.  I'm sure book piracy is an important problem, but in this same spirit, Bramhall and his publishers might have mentioned the depicted musicians, perhaps in an afterward.  More importantly, the book could have portrayed the musicians more accurately:  The Beetles didn't talk in a beat 'jive,' Elvis was a great guitarist and singer before his weight problems and big collars made him so easy to make fun of, and it's inconsistent and a backhanded tribute for Hepcat to say to Little Richard (illustrated as a frog): \\"Good golly, Miss Molly!\\" \\"...Somebody put a frog down that frog's throat. I can't hear a thing.\\"<br /><br />The book changes in the direction of \\"Fantasia,\\" and Hepcat hears the sounds of nature. As a thunderstorm rains down on Hepcat, big alligators and gorillas play percussion: kettledrums, snare drums, congas. A lightening bolt overhead prepares to crash two gigantic cymbals, and tall trees play saxophones and an accordion.  As two bells atop a clock tower clang away, Hepcat remembers all he's heard on his walk and realizes that \\"Music IS everywhere.\\"  For some reason, this does inspire him, and his pre-concert jitters dissipate. Hepcat, aided by Elvis, Little Richard, the trees, the alligators, etc.) gives a triumphant performance.  Thankfully, the Beatles are not included in this ensemble, although a yellow submarine hovers near the stage.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Branham draw appealing and original illustrations, with sly touches and wonderful exaggerations of line and perspective.  When Hepcat looks out over the empty hall, the front section of chairs quiver as if already filled with that night's audience. The overwrought Hepcat wraps his arms together into a twisty braid, and the city autos are slightly atop each other in a in a \\"Truckin'\\" pose.  Then there's the wonderful gigantic frog/Little Richard figure, with giant hair and gleaming teeth and eyes, while an appreciate audience of pussywillows beams its approval.  I don't think that it matters if some of the musical references maynot be known to the book's audience (you can always describe them and their music to the younger set), although the crow quill pen, acrylic ink, and watercolor wash drawings tend towards the monochromatic.  However, the subordination of Hepcat's feelings and personality (and a credible resolution) to the depiction of celebrity guests detracts from the overall appeal. The concept is winning, but the book lacks an authentic voice.eferences may not be known to the book's audience (you can always describe them and their music to the younger set), although the crow quill pen, acrylic ink, and watercolor wash drawings tend towards the monochromatic.

We've got pirate movies, play figures, books, \\"The Pirates of Penzance,\\" even the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Perhaps young Jeremy Jacob, borrowed by some wayward pirates for his digging skills (to hide the treasure, of course!), offers the best clue:<br /><br />\\"But nobody tells pirates to go bed, to take a bath, or to brush their teeth... In addition, they don't change into pajamas-unless they want to. Pirates don't do anything they don't want to-except for maybe swabbing the decks.<br /><br />Whether it be independence, riches, the potential to swear, or the boys' club ambiance, pirate stories are very popular, and \\"How I Became a Pirate\\" is one of the best comical turns at the genre. A motley crew notices Jacob's sandcastle building and digging talents (no rock music pun intended, pirate crews are just always motley) of colorful and friendly lost pirates:<br /><br />\\"Ahoy thar, matey! Be this the Spanish Main?\\"  \\"No,\\" I said, \\"this is North Beach.\\"  The pirates decide to take him with them because they need a good digger.  Now, frankly, this is kidnapping (see Kidnap, the great pirate story by R.L. Stevenson, by the way). Author Melinda Long handles this deftly: \\"I didn't think Mom and Dad would mind, as long as I got back in time for soccer practice the next day.\\"<br /><br />Jeremy Jacob has great fun with the personable pirates. He learns pirate manners (there aren't any) plays soccer on deck, and sits on a gigantic treasure chest, with a jeweled crown on his head and doubloons at his feet.  Jeremy thinks he has found his calling.<br /><br />However, there's a downside to piracy.  Melinda Long starts slowly, as Jeremy notes that pirates' teeth are green since they don't have to brush them.  There are other signs of civilization and family life that he begins to wish for, things he probably took for granted before. There's no one to read him a story or tuck him into bed. And, when a fierce storm comes, with \\"everyone yelling and lowering and battening\\" he decides that maybe pirate life isn't as cushy and romantic as he thought. Besides, he has his family, his home, a dog, and soccer back on land.<br /><br />The pirate story parody is so easy to contrive that it risks formulaic retelling.  However, author Long's humorous dialogue and sense of comic timing are great read-out-loud material.  The pirate crew, for example repeatedly acts as a chorus to the Captain's commands:  And if you ever need us, \\"Braid Beard added, \\"just run the Jolly Roger up yonder pile\\"  \\"Up yonder pole!\\" the others shouted. This device gets a little old after awhile, but it's the kind of interplay elicits laughter when read aloud. David Shannon's acrylic illustrations are big, boldly colorful, and dynamic: He crowds the pirates together and slightly distorts size to convey the bustling deck and interior.  Shannon draws one pirate with a patch on the left eye and one on the right, the dubiously blind pirate removes them one at a time to look at the surrounding activity. In a now famous picture among book fans, Shannon replicates \\"Washington Crossing the Delaware\\" in a spread showing the pirates and Jeremy rowing towards the ship.  It's a comical picture and Long knows when to lay back: She writes only \\"That's how I became a pirate\\" at the top of the page. Great illustrations and a narrative that honors both the adventurous and the tender make this pirate story a standout.yelling and lowering and battening\\" he decides that maybe pirate life isn't as cushy and romantic as he thought.

After reading many Candlewick books, it appears you're practically guaranteed a great children's book if they've published it.  \\"And Here's To You\\" is no exception.  It features creative poems, fantastic illustrations, and quality production (e.g., sturdy pages, excellent color reproduction, etc.)  This book celebrates diversity and individuality without going preachy or too new-agey.  In other words, it's a book that almost any kid is going to love.  David Elliott's rhyming tributes to various animals are clever, fun, and winning:<br /><br />\\"Here's to the fish!<br /><br />The Bubble People!<br /><br />Fish!<br /><br />Here's to the spiny ones,<br /><br />The river and the briny ones,<br /><br />The toothy and the eely ones,<br /><br />All squishy squishy-feely ones<br /><br />Oh, I love the fish!\\"<br /><br />The animal pictures are bright and vividly colored illustrations, swirling with texture from Randy Cecil's oil on paper technique. To accompany the `dogs'  poem,  Cecil draws a girl surrounded by dogs who are fetching, howling, sleeping, sitting, and licking.<br /><br />\\"Here's to the dogs!<br /><br />The Dreaming People!<br /><br />Dogs!<br /><br />Here's to the howling ones.<br /><br />The running, yipping, yowling ones,<br /><br />All go and fetch stick ones,<br /><br />The LICK LICK LICK LICK LICK ones.<br /><br />Oh, I love the dogs!\\"<br /><br />The imaginative people metaphor is a wonderful conceit, authentically egocentric for its young audience. There are additional poems and pictures about birds, bears, bugs (\\"The Leggy People!\\"), cats, cows (\\"The Giving People\\"), and finally, people (\\"The People People!\\") and \\"you\\" (\\"The You Person!\\"):  \\"... Oh, how I love you! The You Person! You Person You! Yes! You! I love you!\\"<br /><br />It's even more warm and fun than it sounds.  A bighearted book, beautifully realized.	2005-04-28

Depending on which version you read, the townspeople give the scaly, stinking, vicious, dragon tribute of two sheep per day, and, when they invariably run out of sheep, they begin feeding it their own children.  The King is obviously horrified, but what can he do?  However, when the lottery selects his own daughter, who should appear but Sir George, (later the patron Saint of England) just in time for the king, if not for the subjects.  The daughter worries for his safety, but the knight spears the dragon in its one vulnerable spot, then in a gallant display, borrows the daughter's girdle to drag the wounded dragon down to the town.  For his own tribute, George asks only that the citizens become baptized; after this, he cuts off the dragon's head.  Not a good ending for the dragon, but then, he wasn't a very nice dragon.<br /><br />Like others before him, Kenneth Grahame modified this bloody tale for the consumption of the very young, and turned it completely on its head.  This dragon would rather sleep than slay, purr than prey, and his true nature is discovered by a tow-headed young boy who gradually becomes friends with the pacifist, poetry-loving beast (\\"why I wouldn't hurt a fly.\\").  Lay low, he advises him.  Naturally, though, St. George arrives, and everyone acts as expected--except for the dragon.  He simply refuses to attend his own demise:<br /><br /> \\"Well, tell him [St. George] to go away,\\" said the dragon. \\"I'm sure he's not nice. Say he can write if he likes. But I won't see him.\\" The boy, however, understands the underlying social pressures (which echo those of the British class system during Grahame's time) and replies:  \\"But you've got to,\\" said the boy. \\"You've got to fight him, you know, because he's St. George and you're the dragon.\\"<br /><br />The dragon, the knight, and the young boy, a person with neither power nor social distinction, make a plan.  The plan is simple: Fake it.  And so, like one of Vince McMahon's TV \\"wrestling\\" matches, St. George and the Dragon have it out, with flames and fury, and, as St. George just barely pierces the dragon in a pre-arranged safe spot.  The townspeople, who have brought picnics for the presumed slaughter, were satisfied with the spectacle: \\"And all the others were happy because there had been a fight, and-well, they didn't need any other reason.\\"<br /><br />The original story, one of several short studies published in Grahame's \\"Dream Days\\" (1898, ten years before Grahame's most famous and beloved work, \\"The Wind in the Willows\\")  may be found at  [...] Grahame wrote \\"The Reluctant Dragon\\" long at times, and one sees his concerns with religion and nature so evident in the river adventure scene of Wind in the Willows. Inga Moore takes out most of the slower, descriptive narrative (which might be enjoyed by older readers), and focuses instead on the dragon/boy/St. George relationships and the exciting battle. Compare the following excerpts (the first is Grahame's); this is great abridgement except for the inexplicable deletion of the last sentence, a very funny, modernist touch by Graham:<br /><br />1. Then a cloud of smoke obscured the mouth of the cave, and out of the midst of it the dragon himself, shining, sea-blue, magnificent, pranced splendidly forth; and everybody said, \\"Oo-oo-oo!\\" as if he had been a mighty rocket! His scales were glittering, his long spiky tail lashed his sides, his claws tore up the turf and sent it flying high over his back, and smoke and fire incessantly jetted from his angry nostrils. \\"Oh, well done, dragon!\\" cried the Boy, excitedly. \\"Didn't think he had it in him!\\" he added to himself.<br /><br />2.

Joey fetches the ball through the trees, up and down a hill, between tables, and into and out of a hole.  There's no question that Yang's pictures are superb; he uses compelling textures, colors, and patterns throughout the book.  The variety of backgrounds is a mini-textbook in graphic design:  He uses repeated patterns, large blocks of color, and modernist 50's design elements on different pages.<br /><br />Digital rendering can be cold at times, and this is somewhat true here.  Many times, the work seems flat and too abstract. However, the colors, action, and use of imperfect, squiggly lines (see the cityscape, for example, though I wish he had used this technique more often) help to reduce this feeling.  Unfortunately, the pictures don't always clearly illustrate the book's bolded prepositions and directional words.  For example, Joey is show chasing the ball \\"through the trees,\\" but the stick-figure green-leaved trees are set against a flat orange background that shows no perspective.  If a child weren't sure what \\"through\\" meant, this book would probably not help much. Similarly, there were problems with the illustrations for \\"among\\" (a difficult concept made harder because Jet is way off to the side in a spread cluttered with birds), \\"into\\" (directional arrows substitute for Joey actually going \\"into\\" something),  and \\"across\\" (the design is superb 1960's era modern, but the level of abstraction and point of view obscure the action ).<br /><br />Other drawings are more completely successful (e.g., \\"on,\\" \\"over\\") because they're well-designed, beautiful to look at, and illustrate the bolded word.  For the imagery, this is a 5* book. However, readers who want to expand their vocabulary might be slightly disappointed.	2005-04-23

Unfortunately, sometimes the parody is so easy that the author basically repeats others' efforts.  However, in \\"Ruby and the Sniffs,\\" author and illustrator Michael Emberley writes  a truly original story, using `Goldilocks'  only as backdrop for the character, the irrepressible Ruby the Mouse.<br /><br />Ruby is a curious, mischievous mouse. In fact, he even fibs a little.  While playing hide and go seek with his stern, seen-it-all babysitter, Mrs. (Edna) Mastiff he promises he won't hide by using any hallways or staircases-but that's exactly what he does.  He climbs to the upstairs apartment, empty except for unpacked boxes and an odorous smell.  Always wary of burglars, he announces himself loudly, but there is no reply. Sudden he hears a noise; it must be the burglars.  She tries to hide under a bed, but one is too high, the second too low, and the third one falls apart. She awaits his fate.  Suddenly, looming overhead, he sees the biggest, pinkest snouts he's ever seen:<br /><br />Stop sniffing me!\\" Ruby shouted. Leaping up, Ruby discovered that \\"the three enormous snouts were attached to three enormous pigs.\\"<br /><br />\\"Look!\\" squealed the littlest enormous pig. \\"A gerbil! A gerbil!\\" Ruby straightened up. \\"Listen, Porkchop,\\" she snapped, I am no GERBIL!\\"<br /><br />Several motifs recur after the initial meeting. These pigs apparently did just fall off the turnip truck, especially Poppa Pig, who is as full of slangy sayings as his tummy is full of trashy food (\\"Well twist my tail and call me a guinea pig!\\"), and there are a few echoes of Goldilocks:  \\"And somebody,\\" snorted Poppa Sniff, \\"has been eating my sticky fish heads.\\"<br /><br />The beginning illustrations are of the Sunday comic variety, but Emberley's imagination and energy soar when he gets to the action pictures of the three pigs, the secret burglar, and Mrs. Mastiff \\"halting the intruder with a perfectly timed linebacker tackle.\\"<br /><br />\\"Someone call nine-one-one!\\" shouted Ruby.<br />\\"That's a good idea!\\" said Momma Sniff. \\"What's the number?\\"<br /><br />Ruby the mouse is loveable because of his energy and enthusiasm. Even though he cheats at hide and go seek, acts a bit cheeky towards his upstairs neighbors, and is your generic wise-guy, she has a helpful and somehow innocent quality. This is an enjoyable, funny book that brings clever dogs and the piggy pigs to a revitalized Goldilocks tale.ting the intruder with a perfectly timed linebacker tackle.\\"    \\"Someone call nine-one-one!\\" shouted Ruby.  \\"That's a good idea!\\" said Momma Sniff. \\"What's the number?\\"    Ruby the mouse is loveable because of his energy and enthusiasm.

Gooseberry lives in a river community where all the  friendly, but very busy animals prepare for winter in their own way.  The brown beaver must finish his dam, the deep auburn squirrel collects acorns, and the rabbit has to cozy up his den (the entrance to which looks very much like the outline of a bunny!). The bright colors and very approachable animals make for a joyous story.<br /><br />But Gooseberry hears his own call of the wild, and that call commands him to practice flying. He has a bumpy takeoff near the beaver dam and soars happily among the orange and yellow leaves. There's just enough tension as we see all the animals gathering food for winter-except for Gooseberry. Even Gooseberry is concerned:<br /><br />\\"Winter's coming! And I'm not ready!' said Gooseberry. Mama laughed. \\"Little gooseberry, don't you remember what I told you?  Geese don't stay here for the winter. It gets too cold.\\" We'll be fling south, where it will be nice and warm,\\" Papa said. \\"It's a long, long trip, and that's why you need to practice flying. You've been getting ready for winter all day!\\"<br /><br />In a final picture, we see Gooseberry and his parents flying high above the pond, where Gooseberry's non-migrating friends wave goodbye. It's a lovely picture of purple hazed mountains, golden-topped trees, autumnal leaves, and evergreen trees.  This is a gentle story with friendly, inviting animal characters, a nature-driven plot, and excellent color quality.	2005-04-19

The toddler has also written valentines for his cat, his teddy bear, a bird, his grandma, a neighborhood girl, his grandma, mom, and other family members.  The book, written by the author of \\"The Nothing to Do Puppy,\\" may serve as a reminder that one doesn't need to wait for Valentine's Day to enjoy playing and showing one's feelings towards others.<br /><br />The poems are very lyrical and sweet, and the words easy to read.  The book focuses on simple, shared fun, the enjoyment of animals and nature, and gentle give and take of good relationships: Sitting with his brother (I assume), the young boy assures him: \\"If you'll be my Valentine/I'll sit with you today. We'll read a book/ about some frogs/ If you don't want to play.  L There's a Valentine showing a frog holding a heart underneath the text. The facing pages shows the boys read together on a soft-looking, big green couch with a plate of heart-shaped cookies nearby.  Illustrator Fumi Kosaka's drawings are soft, soothing, and uncluttered, and the text is set against slightly textured solid color backgrounds.  It's a warm, sometimes humorous book, good for Valentine's Day, sleep time, or just cozy up and read time.  The book seems just a bit expensive compared to others, but that may be due partially to the fame of its author, the award-winning Cynthia Rylant, and its recent publication date.	2005-04-14

Tracey Pearson's \\"Myrtle\\" is a lively, colorful book that teaches toddlers and young elementary school kids how to outwit, outplay, and outlast neighborhood bullies. It's a masterful turn by Pearson, who writes and draws with sensitivity and vivacity.<br /><br />Myrtle and her baby brother are happy children who enjoy books, games, and the outdoors, all under the watchful love of their parents. However, this rodent rhapsody is disturbed when Frances moves next door.  Pearson gets right to the point: \\"Frances did not love Myrtle or her baby brother. Frances made mean signs, sang mean songs, and said mean things, Frances was mean.\\"<br /><br />Pearson cleverly mixes the threat with some humor, so that the mean mouse won't frighten readers and listeners too much: \\"When Myrtle's ball rolled into Frances's yard, Frances kept it for three weeks and two days. Myrtle only got it because her baby brother found it. Frances had covered it with bubble gum, and it stuck to his nose.\\" Frances is both mean and persistent, and she dresses up as a monster, plants rubber snakes, and throws water balloons at the increasingly anxious mouse victims.<br /><br />Here, Pearson's story really departs from cookie cutter formulas entailing wise parents or tricky, funny revenge: She shows that being a victim hurts, Myrtle decides not to go outside at all, and, for some unexplained reason, her parents are unable to comfort her.  Pearson shows that parents are not omnipotent and sometimes have to turn to outside help.  That is why the loving parents call Aunt Tizzy back from her African safari to help Myrtle.  (\\"Aunt Tizzy dropped her binoculars and caught the first elephant out of the jungle.\\").  If ever there were a lay counselor, it is Aunt Tizzy. She doesn't confront the problem immediately; instead, she focuses on relaxing Myrtle by having fun with her.  They \\"giggled and played\\"; \\"they roared and they howled and they yowled\\" while playing with Tizzy's African masks. Tizzy wears authentic African clothes and masks, beautifully illustrated by Pearson, add even much vitality to the book, but it's a cozy energy, all played out in the intimate safety of Myrtle's large closet.<br /><br />Again, Pearson eschews the obvious.  In many books, she and Myrtle would avenge themselves by scaring Frances with the masks. Instead, Tizzy tells Myrtle how she handles \\"nasty lions\\" in Africa. She tells them they are rude, \\"and if they continued, I simply roared back.\\" And sometimes she \\"would just sing and dance until they were gone\\"  Myrtle comes out of her closet feeling \\"bigger and stronger,\\" and when Frances confronts Myrtle, her aunt's lessons serve her well. She uses her words (\\"How rude!\\"), and then they sing happy, silly songs, drowning out Frances's mean ones. They dance and \\"squiggle and wiggle,\\" and have so much fun that they forget Frances, who finally comes out of her hiding place and waits \\"for someone to notice her.\\" (This implied need for attention could be discussed with your young audience.)<br /><br />This very impressive book is truly original, not an easy feat in kids' books.  Pearson doesn't take any shortcuts or easy laughs (well, except for the baby brother being so happy he wets his pants); instead, she shows innovative ways to calm the bullied child and build self-confidence.  Rather than simply giving Frances \\"a dose of her own medicine,\\" or scaring her back, the young mice learn to combat their fears from the inside first: Overlaying anxiety with fun and confidence, and then gently modeling a few verbal and behavioral coping techniques.  Psychologically adept for adults, yet enormously fun, colorful, and relevant for youngsters, this superb book is as entertaining and engaging as it is helpful.thentic African clothes and masks, beautifully illustrated by Pearson, add even much vitality to the book, but it's a cozy energy, all played out in the intimate safety of Myrtle's large closet.   <br /> <br />Again, Pearson eschews the obvious.

Children lack the power and the authority to effect their environments in more direct, adult ways, so \\"the sneak\\" is part of their fantasy play, and an icon that they relate to in books.  Her superb evocations of the sneaky in her best stories--the award-winning \\"Goodnight Gorilla\\" and \\"Officer Buckle and Gloria\\"--are conveyed through text and pictures showing the surprised and deceived authority figures. Rathmann, like her animal heroes, winks her eye at us in secretive, lightly subversive collusion.<br /><br />I love Rathmann's books, and really wanted to enjoy this one as well. However, while the pictures are fabulous, and more noteworthy than in her previous books (including the Caldecott-winning `Officer Buckle,' the story is not nearly as engaging.  If you can take your eyes off the dramatic black shadows stumbling through the forest (the heroic boy chasing after the wayward babies), and focus solely on the plot, you may agree that it just doesn't compare to her other efforts.  The rhymed story is fairly routine, although Rathmann writes some terrific lines:<br /><br />They crawled in a cave-<br />You cried, \\"Babies, BEHAVE!\\"<br />But the babies loved bats,<br />So the babies just waved!\\"<br /><br />This is followed by the babies crawling over a ledge with a wonderful picture of one safely on a lower ledge, and the other three \\"who thought they were birds/And got caught on a tree!\\"  The four distinct babies calming but precariously perched in the picture, silhouetted against the bright yellow and blue background with hints of orange suggesting the coming of twilight. Two upside-down bats observing the scene are echoed below by the upside-down baby hanging on the branch of a Seussian tree. This is wonderful stuff.  However, the initial wonder of the pictures wears a bit as we see the technique on each page (although the increasingly dramatic sky is masterfully done), and the suspense diminishes once we know the babies are safe. In addition, the rhyming narrative is definitely subordinate to the pictures, and just doesn't seem up to her usual high standard.<br /><br />\\"Remember the way<br />They followed you home that day?<br />Through the cave and the trees,<br />On their brave, little knees,<br />Waving \\"bye-bye\\"<br />To the bats and the bees-<br />OKAY!<br />What a day<br />When the babies crawled away!<br /><br />I felt like I'd heard a similar story, although more obnoxious, tedious, and louder, in the first \\"Rugrats\\" movie.  This is an excellent book, and I do recommend it. The illustrations are her best, even if not as funny or intimately sly as in \\"Goodnight Gorilla.\\" However, the combination of story, humor, and illustration are better in `Gorilla' and \\"Officer Buckle and Gloria.\\" You really can't go wrong with any of them, though.  \\"The Day the Babies Crawled Away\\" has the advantages of dramatic, skillful graphics, a large-format, and a human hero with whom your audience may especially relate.

Even the beginning, however, suggests the point guard's choices as he drives down the court:<br /><br />\\"Magic contemplates his next move. Should he go in? Or Out? Or should he stay right where he is.\\"<br /><br />Before I suggest that Magic loft up one to a soaring Michael Cooper for a \\"Coop-A-Loop,\\" let's turn to the dilemma facing Magic the cat.  Each of the above choices entails different benefits, and all of them are tantalizing to a cat generally hungry for adventure, sleep, and food. For example, if he leaves his home, \\"maybe he could chase the loons. He'd hunt them along the rock shore, stalk them through the reeds, leap after them, then eat them.\\" (It looks like the loon just got away in time in the pictures showing Magic's fantasy.)  Magic continues to ponder the possibilities; We see him envision swimming under the water to catch  the brightly  colored salmon, riding a moose to the bears' island, and sharing a meal of salmon and blueberry pie.  This sounds good! But then again, \\"maybe not. Maybe if he stays right where he is, Magic's next move will come to him.\\"  And that's exactly what happens, as the big round cat gently falls asleep on the front porch.<br /><br />In addition to writing an imaginative story about imagination, Elisha Cooper's watercolor and pencil drawings are outstanding. His drawings recall those of Barry Moser with their soft colors, excellent depiction of light, and use of \\"white space.\\"  Cooper paints fairly realistically, but he also lets you see his  watercolor technique as well.  Much of the action is seen from the cat's eye level, but Cooper knows when to pull back to show you gorgeously illustrated panoramas of water, hills, and the cloud-adorned sky. Like most good daydreams, the book is both engaging and calming at the same time. This is a peaceful and beautiful book for story time and bedtime.

There's a real 40's feeling to this book, with its thickly three-dimensional interior objects that look like they're made from marshmallows and foam rubber.  While it's true that there's not a tremendous amount of action in the story, the oversized objects, the images of globby glue and jam spilling on the floor, the strewn toilet paper, and the smiling eyes on the faces of the watchful clock and the framed duck painting give this book an emotive quality full of real and potential energy. I think it will hold the attention of the toddlers for which it was intended.<br /><br />The story is simple but heartfelt and recognizable. It's Mother's day in pig suburbia, and the little pig girl (or boy, it's kinda difficult to tell)  wants to treat Mommy on her special day.  The adorable little pig's desires are greater than her skill,; however, and such surprises as breakfast in bed, a homemade greeting, and a cake turn out, well, badly.  The mother, in a familiar motif, winds up doing more than she normally would as she somewhat secretly cleans up behind her child.  It's touching, because both Mother and little pig are showing their love for each other, whether it's the little one tearing out the planted daffodils (\\"Mommy loves yellow daffodils. I know because she planted them all around the house\\") or the Mom cleaning the messy house or the messy piglet who spilled everything!  Some of the scenes are a bit jumpy, you have to infer that the little pig did something to make breakfast in bed turn into breakfast on the floor beside the bed (maybe the pig excitedly jumped up and down).  If you're prepared for these few discontinuities beforehand, you can have fun with your audience by asking, \\"Now how do  you suppose that happened?\\"<br /><br />This is a funny and fun book that shows how even the best-laid plans of pigs and people often go awry, but need not diminish the thought and effort that went into them.  Dan Andreasen's pastel colors shows a real warmth between the two porcine ones, and his setting is a simple, uncomplicated one where pigs--not possessions--matter most. There's a real warmth evoked by  the look of the 40's and the old-fashioned look of claymation and  the stylizations of the 1940's.

Author/illustrator Geisert's very imaginative story about two groups of feuding pigs is a triumph of illustration and imaginative myth-making.  Two tribes of pigs, the River Patrollers and the slightly unsavory Pigaroons (\\"descendents of Spanish pirates\\" maintain an uneasy peace on opposite sides of a large river.  Some vestiges of the Pigaroons' pirate past remain, because they  persist in stealing from the Patrollers.<br /><br />Just before the annual winter fete and ice sculpture contest, the `Roons cross the frozen river and steal the Patrollers' only  block of ice large enough to for an ice statue.  The \\"good\\" pigs are left with nearly nothing, while the ice-rich thieves build an enormous statue of Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto.  In one of Geisert's  superb etchings, he shows dozens of pig pirates readying lowering the stolen ice block.  Echoes of the Pigaroonian pirate past are seen not only in ship remains (somehow the hulls have eroded), but in shapes that cleverly suggest ships: There are small hills resembling the elevated rear deck of a galleon, and triangles in the scaffolding that evoke images of sails and rigging. The Patrollers have had enough, however: \\"One patriarch declared, `No more! They've stolen enough stuff from us!'  A plan was made.\\" Using a keen knowledge of physics, especially thermodynamics, the Patrollers cut their remaining ice into a thin translucent disc, board a balloon propelled flying ship, and avenge their tribe by melting de Soto from on high.<br /><br />The etched illustrations are a wonder. Unfortunately, Geisert doesn't draw the pigs with as much detail or affection as  the landscapes.  He etches the pigs with similar small shapes and little or no facial _expressions, and this decreases our identification and empathy towards them.  As a result, it's difficult to feel very sorry for the Patrollers, and their melting of the Pigaroons' statue seems almost mean-spirited as a result.  We find ourselves almost rooting for the thieving Pigaroons because they at least exhibit some flair and dash. Finally, except for one ice statue of a pig, Geisert eschews the opportunity for visual puns and references to pigs, which might have added to the sneaky theme of the book.<br /><br />Still, the story is very well written, told in a faux-historical tone (tongue in pig's cheek) that has more than a ring of truth.  And, except for the problems  mentioned above, Geisert `s illustrations are uniquely beautiful.  His<br />masterful use of color, shadow, and low light etched turn the bleakish gray icescape into an almost luminous setting, full of clouded light and meticulously line-drawn shadows. The compositions are especially compelling, almost cinematic, with their low horizons, and picture of pigs struggling mightily in the realistically drawn icescape.  Geisert's realization of a pig community with a seafaring, pirating past makes this is one of the most imaginatively drawn books of the year.Pigaroons because they at least exhibit some flair and dash.

And, except for the problems  mentioned above, Geisert `s illustrations are uniquely beautiful.  His  masterful use of color, shadow, and low light etched turn the bleakish gray icescape into an almost luminous setting, full of clouded light and meticulously line-drawn shadows. The compositions are especially compelling, almost cinematic, with their low horizons, and picture of pigs struggling mightily in the realistically drawn icescape.   Geisert's realization of a pig community with a seafaring, pirating past makes this is one of the most imaginatively drawn books of the year.	2005-04-06

Were the King...of the Forest!!!,	After our young hero knocks her lasagna dinner on the floor, her mother sends her to the proverbial corner time-out chair for being \\"wild.\\" The little redhead protests, all big-eyed and incredulous:<br /><br />\\"Wild? Who me? That's so absurd. How could she even use that word?\\"<br /><br />And to prove herself innocent of this outrageous charge, she fantasizes what she would do if she were REALLY wild. She trots outs a series of hypotheticals in a defense worthy of Louis Nizer or Perry Mason:<br /><br />If I were a lion,<br /><br />I'd growl and I'd roar<br /><br />And knock the dishes on the floor.<br /><br />I'd scare the hair<br /><br />right off the cat,<br /><br />but do you see me<br /><br />doing that?<br /><br />No, in fact, we don't! Case closed?  Not yet, for we see that her imagination running wild (in some of the best illustrations of the year). There's a large tawny lion with a reddish mane (that suggests blood), standing and roaring in the kitchen amid smashed dishes and one terribly frightened cat! On the next page, she explains that, were she guilty, were she really wild, she'd be a ferocious bear: \\"I'd scratch and poke and pierce and tear, not sit here nicely in my chair.\\" Dynamic, richly detailed pictures of other wild animals accompanying some clever poetic arguments serve to further her case.<br /><br />This funny and entertaining book gently recognizes how difficult it can be to take responsibility, and the imaginative lengths to which kids (and many adults) will go to find a convincing alibi. As stated above, the pictures are simply outstanding; Heather Solomon gets the most out of the popular watercolor/gouache format. Her very expressive pictures have compositional and textural strength--she does wonders with rhino hide. Sarah Weeks' story captures resentful imagination very well, but also shows its transient nature. The girl's thoughts stray from wild animals to tamer ones (e.g. an owl, a bunny, reptiles, and even lambs) in a psychological statement that we have both angry and tender thoughts. Week's poetry has a very inventive style, with a hint of Tin Pan Alley in one series: \\"Mother doesn't realize/that lions don't apologize/ But when she does, then she will see, the opposite of wild...is me.\\" I recommend this exceptional book very highly; it's one of the year's best.ent that we have both angry and tender thoughts.

Petersen-Schepelern encourages her readers to think creatively about salads; her recipes may can be used  \\"for a light snack or a substantial meal, to serve as an appetizer, or as a palate-cleanser between the entree and the cheese. There's even a fruit salad...\\"<br /><br />She's a Danish-Australian food writer and editor whose recipes are influenced by many cuisines. Recipes include \\"Tatsoi, avocado, and frisee (tatsoi is a \\"crisp baby Chinese leaf sold in many markets,\\" she never explains \\"frisee\\"--it has leaves, I gathered), Lebanese tabbouleh, Tuscan panzanella, Japanese soba noodle salad, and over 25 others. Chapters are divided into the introduction (\\"there's more to salads...\\"); leaves and herbs; vegetables; fish, chicken, and meat; beans, grains and noodles; fruits; dressings (two Asian-based, four pesto variations, vinaigrette variations, and several based on your very own homemade mayonnaise); and an index.<br /><br />The book is attractively presented, with nice close-up photographs; I suspect that this is why many people buy it. While directions are clear (quite precise, actually), many of the recipes include a number of ingredients, some of which may be difficult to find.  However, those familiar with cooking and buying will find these very manageable.  Tonno e fagiolo (Italian tuna and beans) includes a large tuna steak (\\"or two small cans of good quality tuna, about 6 oz. each, drained\\"), olive oil, red onions, fresh garlic, sherry or white wine vinegar, 4 cups of cooked or canned (she does recognize time constraints) flageolet (she informs us these are green, otherwise I know nothing about them from the book) or cannellini beans (or a mixture of the two), fresh basil leaves and small sprigs, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.<br /><br />Overall, some delicious looking recipes, and some interesting combinations (\\"e.g., Rare beef salad with parsley oil and wasabi mayonnaise).  In the beef salad recipe, by the way, she informs us \\"when you serve it, cut slices of beef about 1/2 inch thick: there's nothing worse than mean little paper-thin slices--it always looks as if you bought them at a deli.\\" Well!  She does take her salads seriously.  If you do too, and want a brief and attractive book with new ideas, you may enjoy this collection.serve it, cut slices of beef about 1/2 inch thick: there's nothing worse than mean little paper-thin slices--it always looks as if you bought them at a deli.\\" Well!

However, the story line somewhat lacks unity and coherence for its  intended young audience.  It's a story where things goe unexpectedly right, except for the detail that--between pages one and four--a young boy somehow loses his baby brother while fishing.  There's no explanation, and there are no adults present.  The innocent looking boy begins looking for his brother, but only after the giant fish he's caught promises to read a note left by the wagon if the boy lets him go.  Actually, the boy is not so innocent--he's just caught a fish --and neither is the fish, who, pretending to read, tells James that his brother is by the seashore.  Obviously this is just make-believe, but the dog-eat-dog (so to speak) narrative continues.  On the way there, James encounters a lion who intends to eat him. However, the lion lets him go, \\"moved to tears by the story of the missing baby brother.\\"  Next, James asks an old man and a pig, who confuse us (and your potential audience) with some presumably humorous but actually confusing dialogue.<br /><br />James tried again. \\"Have you seen a baby go by here?\\" he asked.<br />\\"Green, with long whiskers?\\" said the old man. \\"Does it have a curly tail and an orange wig?\\" grunted the pig. \\"No,\\" said James. \\"It's just a regular baby.\\"\\"Then we didn't see it,\\" said the old man. \\"Ask the owl. She sees everything.\\"<br /><br />McPhail then uses a very sophisticated pun that older children and adults might enjoy: \\"I want to go to the seashore,\\" James said. \\"But the owl said to try tomorrow!\\" \\"The owl is never wrong,\\" said the turtle. \\"The fare to Tomorrow is two cents.\\"<br /><br />McPhail's strength shows as he draws the \\"Turtle Taxi\\" with a wise guy look, an appealing purple and yellow cabbie hat, and, in the background, a small thicket of forest, with McPhail's signature crosshatch shading.  The conclusion is rapid and unclear. James makes it to the seashore where he rescues the big fish he had caught when fishing.  The fish advises James to go  home, and when he does, his mother and baby brother are there to meet him. \\"I see you found my note,\\" she said, \\"and you're just in time for lunch.\\"  Apparently the mom is unperturbed by the missing baby boy, the missing James, and the note somehow was supposed to alert James to come home for lunch.  I'm not saying that the book sends a bad message about safety, but that the plot just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Still, toddlers may enjoy McPhail's illustrations as I did, and they may find James' talks with the various animals interesting.<br /><br />NOTE:  The mystery is solved: On the back cover of the book is a copy of a note that James' mother wrote, saying that she took the baby home while James was sleeping, and to please come home for lunch.  Still problematic: Many other readers may also not look at the back cover, and how many parents would leave their young child asleep, alone, and by a stream! Again, an unsatisfying conclusion, even when you find the note.the seashore where he rescues the big fish he had caught when fishing.

296000:US	49600435	R1GJPBMW2QVQZP	0374399689	533175304	The Cat Who Walked Across France: A Picture Book	Books	5	14	14	N	Y	4 1/2  Impressions of a Wandering Feline	An orphaned cat walks from Rouen (just outside of Paris) to Mont Blanc via the Loire Valley, and then all the way to St. Tropez to find his original home in this beautifully illustrated book. Greg  Hallensleben's rich, captivating oil colors, visible brush strokes, dabs of color, atmospheric haze, and subject matter recall such great French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists as Monet, Van Gough, Rousseau, and Gaugin.<br /><br />The unnamed cat, seen walking by a Monet-inspired Notre Dame, seems fated to join his gateaux miserables: \\"He prowled the street begging for scraps to eat and fleeing from stray dogs!  But then, the Gallic spirit arises, and he decides to head for the home he was taken from years ago. The prose respects the intelligence of the young reader, and the inner voice calling him to the sea is believable.<br /><br />However, this is more of a picture book than an adventure tale. Hallensleben shows the effects of light on scenery as the cat journeys towards the Mediterranean.  While Hallensleben's richly textured oils and vast horizons are impressive in their grandeur, they don't distance the reader (perhaps because we can identify with the cat, and because of Hallensleben's warm and varied palette).  We see the cat on a bridge overlooking \\"thundering trains,\\" resting on the lawns of a large, shimmering chateau, seeking refuge in the snowy French Alps, and sipping water near what looks like a Roman bridge.<br /><br />The paintings of the cat's single-minded journey give the book a unity and emotional pull far beyond its relatively simple story.  The cat eventually finds a home and a friendly hand to pet him in a Matisse-inspired home and a Cezanne-inspired sea. This is an excellent book, especially for those who enjoy French landscapes and the painters who envisioned them.	2005-03-30

Before he wrote the more accomplished \\"Pigs Ahoy\\" and \\"Pigs Galore,\\" both featuring a 30-something man and a pigsty of romping pigs, he authored the \\"Pig Pig\\" series about one pig--\\"Pig Pig.\\"  The series aims at a younger audience than his later books, and doesn't feature the single man vs. horde of pigs motif; instead, Pig Pig has a series of adventures that toddlers will enjoy.<br /><br />While a photographer sets up his camera for a picture of Pig Pig, the bow tie clad youngster mutters \\"cheese\\" and is instantly transported to a place depicted in a photo book.  Unfortunately, this is the top of a church steeple from which the porcine one is slowly slipping!  He grabs the book, finds a picture of an airplane, and says \\"Cheese!\\"  Wouldn't you know it--he's suddenly riding the wing of an open cockpit plane flown by a mustachioed man with a purple scarf!  But one semi-dangerous situation leads to another, and Pig Pig keeps rifling through the photo album to escape such potential threats as angry humans (Pig Pig lands on a guitar, in a rowboat scene that recalls French impressionist subject matter), an alligator in a swamp, and hungry dogs.  In perhaps the funniest sequence, he lands squarely and happily on top of a boy's chocolate birthday cake:<br /><br />\\"Chocolate!\\" squealed Pig Pig, \\"My favorite!\\"<br /><br />\\"Get that pig out of my cake\\" a little boy screamed.<br /><br />He finally returns to the studio, resolving not to say cheese to the photographer.  This is a pleasant, albeit fairly simple book, with colorful, action packed pictures by McPhail. It has more color and shading than earlier \\"Pig Pig\\" books, and would probably be an engaging read to the young toddler set.  However, the more complex and funnier pig books mentioned at the top of this review are better efforts, and I recommend them over this one, especially if your audience has any experience following a story book.	2005-03-30

Various buildings, some moved as a whole, others taken apart and reassembled at Shelburne, house items according to their era and function.  The buildings include a lighthouse, a brick farmhouse, a Shaker shed, and a schoolhouse from the mid-19th century, a blacksmith from around 1800, and a \\"saltbox\\" style house from 1782. (Some of the structures are contemporary rurals housing objects, such as the \\"Circus Building\\" with its great display of circus miniatures.<br /><br />Curators placed some historical objects outside near the Museum's scattered gardens, most famously, the Ticonderoga Steamship, dragged over land from Lake Champlain to Shelburne (just south of Burlington, Vermont).  The Ticonderoga underwent another renovation recently, and it's a beautiful ship with a commanding view of the surrounding Vermont countryside. Other transportation at Shelburne includes a train, vintage automobiles, and various horse-drawn conveyances.<br /><br />The book itself is more of a guidebook for travelers visiting the museum, or for those who want a souvenir.  The inexpensive book is too brief for its subject and contains too few photographs (all in black and white) of the various buildings, grounds, and historical pieces.  While you'll undoubtedly enjoy your own photos more, the organization of the book (Museum History, Building Directory, Collections Directory, Suggested Tours--for those with limited time and/or who wish to pursue a common theme--and Museum Notes) make this a nice supplement. There's also an index and a map of the museum (although no map to the museum).  I hope that Shelburne will eventually publish a more thorough (including color photographs) book.	2005-03-30

Jack Gantos and Nicole Rubel deliver one of their best Rotten Ralph books in  this recent book.  Rubel's illustrations capture the irrepressible spirit of Ralph (that is: mischievous, naughty, but competely loveable), and author Gantos cooks up a truly funny, very authentic Ralph adventure in four linked chapters. Owner Sarah wants Ralph to eat  a healthy meal of fruits and vegetables (her refrigerator also contains miso, dates, yogurt, and hamburgers made without meat), but Ralph thinks the food \\"will finish me off.\\"  Sneaky Ralph climbs into the alley while Sarah sleeps and becomes a \\"trash-can gourmet.\\"  The gross-out food he eats, and the piggy manner in which he eats it is true Ralph:<br /><br />\\"He lifted a lit and got busy. He started with a green chicken wing.  Then he nibbled on some squishy squid. After that he licked a furry fish.  For dessert he found a hunk of blue cheesecake...\\"<br /><br />The result?  A nightmare of \\"little rats with spears...jumping up and down on his belly,\\" and a quick trip to the vet. The very, very sick feeling Ralph is asked to cooperate at the vet's office, but he spits out the thermometer. When the vet tries to check Ralph's reflexes by thwapping him on the knee with a little hammer, Ralph kicks the vet off his stool.  (There's a very funny picture accompanying this scene, while frustrated Sarah says, \\"Behave...or you'll just feel worse.\\" More comical resistance follows, until the vet and Sarah and a nurse pour an emetic down a funnel placed in Ralph's mouth. Rubel's talent is very evident in making these potentially violent and unpleasant situations  seem jokey instead of upsetting.  When Ralph wraps the vet and the nurse up in surgical tape; however, the vet decides Ralph need to stay overnight for observation.  This is his comeuppance, so to speak, and Ralph misses Sarah and home terribly.  What to do?<br /><br />Escape, of course!  However, even Ralph learns his lesson about the perils of garbage cuisine, and when he arrives home he just grabs some nuts-to pile on top of a gigantic banana split! Sarah and Ralph are happily reunited.  After 30 years, the Rotten Ralph series is as fresh as ever. I'm a big fan of these zany adventures for young kids, and the plot, the humor, and the pictures are vibrant and incredibly engaging. You might want to also look at Rubel's \\"A Cowboy Named Ernestine\\" and \\"Cyrano the Bear\\" for more humorous pictures and stories! \\"Rotten Ralph\\" is printed on high quality paper with superb color reproduction.he arrives home he just grabs some nuts-to pile on top of a gigantic banana split!

Robert Virgile compiled 20 intermediate SAS programming problems and 50 advanced ones that are short and deceptively simple. However, they are really geared towards those with advanced knowledge and experience, intermediate level users will get only a few right, and beginners shouldn't even tackle this. (An advanced user will have a thorough command of the intricacies of SAS Language.)<br /><br />Here's problem number 2, \\"First Obs Impressions\\" (Virgile relieves some of the pain through his generally clever problem titles):<br /><br />\\"If [data set] OLD contains 100 observations, which of these gets printed?<br /><br />OPTIONS FIRSTOBS=5 OBS=20;<br /><br />PROC SORT DATA=OLD OUT=NEW;<br /><br />BY ID;<br /><br />PROC PRINT DATA=NEW;<br /><br />As with most of the examples, the problem is on one page, and the next page repeats the problem and the solution.  A problem that Virgile has is that he assumes too much knowledge on the part of the reader, and his solutions are often too concise and not written clearly.<br /><br />The answer, in case you're interested, is 12 observations.  Hint: \\"out of observations 5 through 20 from OLD, those with the 12 highest values for ID.\\"  But, will you be interested? There are easier ways to limit observations, but Virgile focuses on the tricky, not the practical. Additionally, while one does learn about the FIRSTOBS= and OBS= options here, the problem and the concepts are poorly indexed in the book.<br /><br />Here's one more problem, from \\"Part 2, 50 Tougher Problems.\\"<br /><br />Virgile write four programs with two lines, and asks you to replace each two-line program with a single line. This is one of the four examples:<br /><br />IF AGE > 21 THEN DRINKER =1;<br /><br />ELSE DRINKER = 2;<br /><br />There are many solution possible for this example, this is one of them: \\"(AGE >21) =2 * (AGE&lt;=21);.\\"  Hint from book: \\"Take advantage of the fact that the SAS System replaces true comparisons with 1 and false comparisons with 0.\\"<br /><br />Solving the problem may indirectly improve your understanding of SAS logic and language.  It may, at some time, even come in handy. Notice again, however, that the main point of this puzzle is to solve it, not to reduce CPU time, keystrokes, or to generally make you a better programmer. The book has challenging problems, some of which can be instructive, but it is poorly organized and not intended to efficiently or systematically improve your SAS programming. Recommended only for advanced SAS users who enjoy \\"brain teaser\\" problems within a SAS context.f the fact that the SAS System replaces true comparisons with 1 and false comparisons with 0.\\" <br /> <br />Solving the problem may indirectly improve your understanding of SAS logic and language.

Famed graphic designer and illustrator Craig Frazier picked one wrong color in this otherwise superbly illustrated book. Frazier chose a brown shade from his computer that will look unpleasantly familiar to those with diaper changing experience.  Unfortunately, the plot is simple, and that makes the illustrations even more important.<br /><br />Stanley drives his 50's era pickup truck along the rolling hills and flatlands of his ranch. The brown background symbolizes the dry, hot landscape, and it's repeated in tree braches and other details.  The color is an immediate turn-off.  This is unfortunate, because graphic design elements are not often seen in children's books. Frazier draws massive but simple geometrical shapes, muscular outlines, and flattened backgrounds that show off his shadow-blackened foreground objects.  These elements are powerful exemplars of commercial and poster art imagery.  He draws Stanley with oversized arms and torso to emphasize his strength, an oversized head-on view of the big orange truck eating up the dusty road, and a pond reflection so real that it looks like a cutout in the page.<br /><br />The prose is, well, prosaic, with tired, familiar phrases (The barn roof was hot enough to fry an egg.\\" \\"The pool was so dry that it couldn't even make reflections.\\"), although Frazier's visual strengths add surprise and interest to the thin but imaginative \\"plot.\\"  Actually, it's hardly a plot, just an unusual occurrence along the road:  When Stanley stops to milk a black and white streaked cow, half of the cow disappears.  (I may be taking this too literally; it's possible that this is just Frazier's choice to de-emphasize the cow.)  Then, when Stanley inexplicably tosses the milk pail contents into the air, the white liquid (milk? magic cow juice?) immediately turns into large milky clouds, floating like fish in the tan colored sky. These fishy clouds bring rain, and the rain turns the ugly browns into a m&eacute;lange of artificial looking, but tantalizing greens (again, all colors were selected from a computer, and the resulting hues are not found in many crayon boxes). That's basically the whole story.  The excellent graphics are the main appeal, but I just wish Mr. Frazier had chosen a different shade of brown from his computer palette.ut tantalizing greens (again, all colors were selected from a computer, and the resulting hues are not found in many crayon boxes).

One of  \\"Saturday Night Live's\\" funnier Chevy Chase skits involved his mimicry of Jane Curtain's news delivery. Sitting next to and slightly behind Ms. Curtain, Chase mouths her words and copies her gestures. Jane, suspicious and discomfited by the audience's laughter, turns around, and Chase looks at her innocently, only to begin anew when she faces the camera again. Gloria the dog emulates this act in Peggy Rathmann's delightfully funny \\"Officer Buckle and Gloria.\\"<br /><br />In the sleepy, accident-prone town of Napville, Officer Buckle takes his safety lectures very seriously. No one else does.  The students at the school auditorium are definitely not listening to him; various kids  sleep, draw, and throw a paper airplane. One girl even has an accident while he's talking, spilling her yogurt on the floor.  Things change dramatically (literally) when police dog Gloria begins to tag along. She accompanies him on stage, and copies his gestures as he delivers such zingers as \\"KEEP your SHOELACES tied.\\"  Gloria's antics spark the kids' interest, and when Buckle turns to Gloria to see what's up, she gives him a sweet and innocent smile.<br /><br />Gloria's talents extend beyond mere mimicry, however, as she proceeds to act out various accidents that Buckle warns against. She flies in the air, for example, when he states the always enthralling \\"NEVER leave a THUMBTACK where you might SIT on it.\\" In one hilarious two-page spread, the increasingly renowned Officer Buckle warns a college audience-and a TV crew-to not swim \\"DURING ELECTRICAL STORMS,\\" and Gloria leaps up, her air looking electrified. Later, while munching popcorn in front of the TV, Officer Buckle discovers the real reason that his safety lectures became so popular. He looks at Gloria, who does one of her best impersonations yet-she looks positively sheepish. Man and dog are temporarily estranged, but eventually Officer Buckle, in an acknowledgement of Gloria as partner, thinks of his best safety tip yet: \\"ALWAYS STICK WITH YOUR BUDDY.\\"<br /><br />Rathmann's vibrant color selection, jokey pictures, and affection portrayal of officer and dog keep the interest level high.  This very funny, well-structured book is another magnificent work by Rathmann. I recommend this very highly as a gift for yourself or others, especially for those who like mischievous, good-hearted dogs.

Visitors are exciting, but they may also bring unexpected and inexplicable habits to one's house. Take Newton the bunny, for example.  While visiting cousins Henry and Wizzie, he won't take off his hat. Not for dinner, not in the bathtub, not even when he goes to bed!  He merely says \\"No hat.\\"  Bunny Henry does not have his sister Wizzie's patience; he calls Newton \\"weird,\\" steals his hat  (\\"Mama made Henry wait an extra ten minutes for his muffin\\"), and tries to trick him into taking off.  Finally, Henry ignores Henry, pretending he doesn't even see him, while Wizzie and Newton make a \\"tiger house\\" in the sandbox. When meanie bunny Gus knocks the house down, Winnie cries and Newton tries to cheer her up: He gives her his tiger, hugs her, and finally gives her his hat.  That does the trick--Wizzie stops crying.<br /><br />The funny thing is that Wizzie keeps the hat on. She wears it all that afternoon, during dinner, when she takes her bath, and even when she goes to bed!  Newton isn't upset that he doesn't have a hat; in fact, he jokes with Henry about it: \\"'No hat!\\" Newton said to Henry, and Henry laughed. BY the next day, all three bunnies are playing happily together, and none of them are wearing a hat (it's on Newton's toy tiger).<br /><br />Although a very simple story, I liked the example of Wizzie's acceptance of Newton's seemingly strange attachment to his hat.  The affection between the two leaves a warm feeling, and we also discover that Newton is neither \\"weird\\" nor so attached to the hat as Henry originally thought.  Conversely, those toddlers somewhat dependent on a favorite object may learn that they can give it up, so that others can enjoy its security too. Soft colors and nice interior details, along with the bunnies' expressive faces add to the book's appeal.	2005-03-22

At first, I didn't quite get the book, thinking the illustrations so cluttered that I didn't even know where to find Halibut.  However, that's part of the fun:  Jackson blends into the early 20th century background in a series of clever disguises that work as a trompe d'oeil. On wondrous page one, he wears a suit colored exactly like the brick wall against which he stands, as a dirigible, a soldier on a might blue horse, a musician, a lady in a giant green hat, and various colonnades decorate the two-page color illustration.  IF there were a book award for set decoration, this would win it.<br /><br />On the next few pages, we see him in a garden-patterned shirt and hat that perfectly matches the flowers in the park.  Again, the other objects in the scene are both intriguing  and function as distracters in the reader's effort to find Halibut: There's an odd tree with gigantic peanuts, a  pineapple plant, and assorted birds, mushrooms, and flowers.  Watch for Jackson's environment matching suits in a grocery store, a library (an especially tough one), and his house (which shows a photo of Jackson covering his eyes!).<br /><br />One day, he receives an invitation to attend the Queen's birthday party. Although he longs to see the Palace, he doesn't want to go to a grand gathering.  However, \\"that night he dreamed of the Palace. HE dreamed of glittering towers, of silver stairs, of a golden door...And when he woke, he had an idea.\\" Halibut Jackson, believing that the fete will be held inside the ornate periwinkle and gold castle interior, creates a suit to match, right down to the jewels on a crown like hat.  In yet another magical picture, Halibut is shown amongst musicians, dancers, a peacock, and elaborate decorations-outside the castle! \\"Everybody noticed Halibut Jackson.\\"  But Jackson learns that being noticed isn't always bad, even when you're completely different from the rest of the guests.  The happy conclusion features yet more clever pictures and costumes, and when I finished the book, I realized this was among the  most original picture books I've recently seen.<br /><br />It takes great talent to pull off  a relatively simple (though satisfying) story mostly through illustrations, but Lucas completely triumphs. His pictures have a definite Matisse influence, and the low-tech production indeed recalls picture books of 50 years ago (thin non-glossy paper, no computer-aided drawing, colors right out of a crayon box). A complete joy to behold, this book is an inspiration for budding artists, a fun \\"search\\" book, and a lightly told message all in one.

Author/illustrator Stoo Hample originally put out \\"The Silly Book\\" in 1961; Candlewick published this edition in 2004. Not having seen the original, it's difficult to say how the two compare. In general, I think that nostalgia and memory make the booklover's heart grow fonder.  However, Candlework's typical high production values (thick glossy paper, quality book materials) may actually work against the frivolity of the book; a cheaper 'zine (slang for low-tech magazine) format may have been more consonant with the throwaway silly humor. Here's an example:<br /><br />SILLY STORY<br />I want to see my mommy a minute,<br />My mimmy a monnit. My mommy a minnit.<br />I want to see my mommy a minnit.<br />To sing her a little song,<br /><br />To sing her a little.<br />To ling her a sittle,<br />To sit her a lingle long.<br />(I think my mommy will like it<br />Because it's a very short long.)<br /><br />Nothing extraordinarily clever here--you're not gonna get something akin to the \\"Mozart effect\\" (in which parents play Mozart for their infants, hoping to stimulate their brains). No, when Hample titled this \\"The Silly Book.\\" he meant it.<br /><br />Here are some examples. Note how some of these riddles and word plays are now very formulaic for adults.  The example immediately following is the kind of riddle that helped build one adult comedian's (G.C.) reputation.<br /><br />SILLY QUESTION<br />If people get chicken pox, What do chickens get? SILLY ANSWER People pox.<br />ANOTHER SILLY QUESTION<br />If Mommy eats a Popsicle, What does Daddy eat?  ANOTHER SILLY<br />ANSWER  A Momsicle!<br /><br />A few other examples follow:<br /><br />SILLY MILLIE<br />\\"I am silly,/You are silly, All of us are silly,/ Willy./ All of us but cousin/ Millie./ She's upside down.\\" (The poem is next to a picture of Millie, upside down, holding a flower labeled, \\"Tillie.\\")<br /><br />SILLY RECIPE<br />\\"Cook three pieces of/spaghetti in a pan of/water for two years.<br />Add one teaspoonful/ of chocolate syrup/ and mix well.<br />Spread on bread/ and freeze.<br />Feed to teddy bear.\\"<br /><br />More than most books, this one depends on the interaction between the reader and the audience. When read with the right expression and tone to a receptive, language/sound fascinated boy or girl, this may be great fun and build future warm memories. Read cold off the page, many of the riddles, poems, and other prose come off as familiar word play. (By the way, the accompanying illustrations are generally simple, although sometimes drawn with clever dialogue or captions).  Perhaps in 1961 this book was somewhat ahead of its time; the utter nonsense of these books may have been a refreshing change for some. Soupy Sales, a somewhat comparable visual and linguistic entertainer,  was still a few years away from TV.  Soupy, however, has a few more layers of meaning--there's a sly wink at the adults not seen here-this book centers around little kids only.  \\"The Silly Book\\" will not ruin your audience's language; instead, it has the potential to increase their enjoyment of language, and, most importantly, to build lasting memories of reading and silly time.  Given that context, I can recommend this book, especially for those adults who can add the enthusiasm that comes from finding an old favorite ready for a new generation.teaspoonful/ of chocolate syrup/ and mix well.

Meisel has fun drawing and writing about the big frothy hats, all covered with ribbons, bows, feathers, and fabrics, and the excited customers who buy them.<br /><br /> \\"'Oh, Mr. Selig, you are a genius!' Loretta Falsetta, the famous opera singer, trilled whenever she bought a hat.\\" \\"'This hat will be perfect for the firefighters' ball!' exclaimed Brenda Hookenlader, the fire chief's wife.\\"<br /><br />Everything runs smoothly at the shop, until Selig cannot find the last two feathers needed for Mrs. Hookenlader's hat. He entrusts Zara with finishing the hat while he searches the city for more, telling her that she'll make something \\"good enough for Mrs. Hookenlader, or even the President's wife.\\"  But, inexplicably (to the reader, as well), he cannot find any feathers, and therefore he cannot make any more hats.<br /><br />In a set of exciting pictures, Meisel shows Selig traveling on a great steamship and then through jungles and a desert to find bird feathers. Meanwhile, we see Zara and her mother walking around New York City, feeding ducks, buying hot roasted chestnuts, and watching a puppet show.  The period costumes, just like the hats, are colorful and authentic-looking.  Finally, Zara shows that necessity is indeed the mother of invention by resourcefully designing her own colorful hat coverings. Zara's paper mache animals, bugs, and other unusual decorations tree adorn the new hats.  They're  quite inventive, perhaps too much so for society New York society (especially that one with the Dalmatian next to the fire hydrant)!  However, when Selig returns empty-handed (again, inexplicably) to the shop, he sees the wacky hats, the crowded store, and later, even Alice Roosevelt-the President's wife!<br /><br />This is a fun story that encourages creativity and the famous \\"can-do\\" attitude found in Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland movies (`say, I have an old bicycle tire, and the judge can lend me his robe-let's put on the show!') The pictures are bright and crisp, and Meisel does an excellent job of showing both close-ups of  Sigmund and his daughter Zara, and scene-setting long perspectives as well.<br /><br />There's a real problem, however,  with the premise that Selig cannot find any feathers. The book's plot turns on this premise, but we are never told why the feather source has apparently flown the  coop.  There's not even an attempt to explain this sudden turn of events.  Meisel strives for an authentic portrayal of New York City--he even includes an 1899 photograph of Sigmund and Zara on the back cover-and one wishes he would have added some fun explanation about the feathers.  You may want to ask your audience to think of some reasons for this absence, or maybe they'll be so enthralled by the story that it won't matter. A very good book, but it could have been even better.movies (`say, I have an old bicycle tire, and the judge can lend me his robe-let's put on the show!')

His first word is \\"Eat!\\" and little pig follows the dictates of his appetite to hilarious ends in this is wildly funny and superbly structured book.  Author Jonathan London's slightly subversive humor, funny rhymes, and surprise denouement make a reading feast out of a typical recipe for a kids' book: Take one messy animal (or child, depending on taste), combine with lots of food, and watch the chaos. Instead, London's original variation surprised me: When the text read, \\"and little Pig ate. He ate OFF his plate,\\" I expected a rather pedestrian book focusing on prepositions. Turn the page, though, and it continues: \\"and he ate ON his plate\\" accompanied by a drawing of the big-nosed cutie-pig sitting on a plate and eating eggs and a banana.<br /><br />The unusual illustrations by Delphine Durand add greatly to the book's appeal; there's a simple innocence, and a 1940's-1950's aesthetic that recalls Chris Van Dusen's excellent \\"Mr. Magee\\" books.  She adds funny touches that magnify London's rhymes: A whole mouthful of long spaghetti slurped into Pig's cheek-stuffed mouth, and an explosion of food around the kitchen (almost resembling a Jackson Pollack painting) sets the background for the text:<br /><br />Food in his hair.<br />Food in the air.<br />Food on the ceiling<br />  and food<br />  EVERYWHERE!<br /><br />It slid down the walls<br />And flew from the fan.<br />It was rolled into balls<br />And spilled from the pan.<br /><br />Little Piggy is good-natured and mostly innocent, like a porcine version of Spongebob, and he is as focused on food as Squarepants is on making hamburgers.  However, little Pig seems to have a faster learning curve than the sponge, for when he shouts his second word ever, \\"Neat,\\" he neatly devours his dessert while in bed.  Pigs will be pigs, however:  \\"Sweet!\\" he said (\\"Sweet was his third word) and threw his toys instead.\\"<br /><br />This book (printed on quality paper, by the way) would make an excellent gift for older infants and for toddlers, or for slight older kids who are beginning to read.

A. Milne--the Winnie the Pooh stories), much like the recently reviewed \\"Walk Rabbit Walk.\\"  The cold, blustery December days and the vocabulary (\\"fortnight\\") transport us to England, a land rich in Christmas-related literature (Dickens, of course, and--in Wales--Dylan Thomas' \\"A Child's Christmas in Wales\\"). Somehow Christmas seems more steeped in tradition in such a setting, and David McPhail captures it almost perfectly in his long flowing sentences:<br /><br />\\"Perhaps, though, the thing Henry loved most about Christmas was the tree. A fine and full Christmas tree, beautifully decorated, with presents underneath and good friends all around.  This was Christmas all right--and Henry smiled as he thought about it.\\"<br /><br />Although some of the people have familiar McPhail faces, the animals and their surrounding depict a lovely little English town. On a two-page spread, we see Henry and Stanley entering the village to find a Christmas tree. McPhail shows us the thatch-roofed houses, the smoke steaming up from the chimneys, and the whole picture thick with shading and texture.  The enormous trees are so laden with snow that they look like moose antlers, bending over the narrow country bridge and the ice-islanded stream.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Henry's search for a tree. When they get there too late to buy  one of the \\"better\\" ones, he and Stanley try to buy one at the local school. IN what may be an homage to Charles Schultz's Christmas TV show (the one with Vince Guaraldi tearing it up on the piano), Stanley finds a scraggly, neglected tree similar to the one that Charlie Brown chooses, but Henry rejects it.<br /><br />Unlike Charlie Brown, Henry has confidence to spare, and when he spends all of their Christmas dinner money to enter the church raffle for a big, beautiful tree, he's already making plans on where he will place it when he wins. He wins it, but it so busy eating at the doughnut shop that he doesn't get there within the two-minute time limit.  There is a happy conclusion for all involved. McPhail, the illustrator of more than 50 books for kids, has written a suspenseful, somewhat humorous Christmas story,  and his pictures drawn with crow-quill pen, ink, and watercolor evoke the moods and colors of a small town Christmas.<br />Highly recommended!where he will place it when he wins.

The dogs have had it made til the baby arrives, and in a case of interspecies rivalry, the two dogs are jealous of the attention and praise that the little one gets.  They begin to notice his bad (read: un-doglike) ways:<br /><br />\\"Bug baby was full of flaws,<br /><br />He had no tail, no fur no paws,<br /><br />He lay about<br /><br />On back and tummy,<br /><br />Sucking on<br /><br />A rubber dummy.\\"<br /><br />The verse is humorous and colorful, although the plot strains a bit. We're supposed to link that the tiny toddler's destruction of the house (e.g., spilled ink, toys in the bathtub) to the dogs being away at the park. That short subplot is entirely unnecessary.  When the \\"pillaging, plundering\\" actions are discovered, the Mother immediately blames the dogs, locking them outside \\"without their kibbles and kippers/Their ball and their bone.\\"  Although the returning parents blame the dogs as well, Fabio and Gracie  show their family that the real culprit was the baby.<br /><br />Of course, it's all in fun, but there's a mean-spirited depiction of the baby.  The illustrator shows a bottom's up view of Baby Chow's rash-covered behind, and the usually cute, big-eyed, innocent looking baby is shown several times with an evil sort of smile on his face, as if he shows his true character to the dogs only.  I think the book will get a  lot of laughs, but after having just read equally humorous books that promote cooperation, I have just a little trouble with the message and the somewhat contrived plot.	2005-03-15

Books	5	9	11	N	N	The Insomniac Groundhog	This is a clever and very colorful story about a groundhog who just can't seem to get the hang of hibernation.  While his peers presumably sleep from autumn until February, this Groundhog keeps waking up-just in time for the holidays he usually misses.  In a coup de grace, author Judy Cox's Groundhog has an alarm clock that keeps track of time by  months!  Each time he wakes up, Cox's narrative repeats the following (changing only the month):<br /><br />\\"Groundhog curled up in his warm cozy bed. He closed his eyes. He tossed and turned, but he couldn't get to sleep. Finally he got out of bed.  He peered at his clock.  Half-past November.\\"<br /><br />Each new adventure starts with the lines \\"Groundhog went inside. He saw things he'd never seen before,\\" adding a sense of fresh wonder  at his new experiences. At Halloween he sees the costumed children and scarecrows, and a friendly witch flies him back to bed and reads him a story. The next time he wakes up, Autumn, and he sees \\"tall yellow corn shocks and round orange pumpkins.\\"  A turkey flies him home and reads him a story, but not before proclaiming,\\" It's almost winter. You should be in bed, and I should be making myself scarce.\\" At Christmas time, who but Santa himself  flies the excited Groundhog back home on his toy-filled sleigh, reading him a Christmas story, and giving him a cookie.  On his big day, February 2nd, Groundhog is awakened by the alarm; he has slept very well and can scarcely believe it is time to get up already!  Followed by his ever-faithful mouse pal, he goes outside and does his winter prediction duties.<br /><br />Paul Meisel's depiction of the friendly groundhog and the seasonal colors are appealing, and Cox's narrative premise, complemented by her gentle humor, make this interesting and engaging read. Cox also includes a one-page history of groundhog's day after the story. Bright colors,  a casual personal-looking font, and nice glossy paper add to the book's appeal.	2005-03-15

Wearing his engineer-striped cap and denim overalls, the mustachioed, big-eyed Niccolini is a comforting presence:  \\"Some watchmen were as cold and hard as the engines they cared for. Niccolini was not. He was a quiet man. His wife always said he was a good listener.\\"<br /><br />Usually there's no trouble at the train yard, but Niccolini is ready with his whistle and his legs just in case. One night, he hears mysterious sounds, which is just a family of raccoons. However, he then hears low whispers:<br /><br />\\"No, please, no more whistling.\\"<br /><br />\\"Seventy-six boxcars from here to Waxahachie, and only three hours sleep.\\" turn<br /><br />\\"Would you sing to me....Something low and sweet?\\"<br /><br />The whispers are from a train (\\"it takes a very good listener to hear a steam engine worry\\"), and it implores Niccolini for comfort with a song. His hand on the locomotive, Niccolini closes his eyes, remembers a tune his mother used to sing to him, and makes up new words that lull the engine to sleep. The picture of Niccolini singing to the train is as warm as the night must be cold; it's an outstanding illustration by Mark Buehner.<br /><br />Many authors would be satisfied to let the narrative end here; it's already a lovely story. However, author Chuck Wilcoxen extends it in an imaginative way. Niccolini's soothing lullabies not only sooth the trains that need it, but an ever increasing number of mothers  who bring their crying babies to the train yard to hear Niccolini. And, on one particular night, when the wind is howling and all the unsettled babies in the neighborhood come with mothers and fathers to the yard, Niccolini conducts a concert of trains, all playing Niccolini's song by softly blowing their whistles. The clouds, as if directed by Niccolini as well, form in to soft animal shapes, and both parents and kids become calm, trudging back up the hill to their little houses.<br /><br />Buehner, a veteran of many children's books, paints a velvety nightscape sharp outlines and warm facial colors that melt away fears of the dark, and first-time author Wilcoxen masterfully tells a soothing, wistful, and very imaginative tale. This is one of the best children's books of the  year, and it would make an excellent gift.

A. Milne (`Winnie the Pooh'), Beatrix Potter (\\"Peter Rabbit,\\" \\"Jemima Puddleduck,\\" etc.), and Kenneth Grahame (\\"The Wind in the Willows).\\"  These books share a gentle love of nature, specifically the English terrain of woods, farms, and the countryside. From the gently shaded opening illustrations and the text, I correctly placed Colin McNaughton and Elizabeth Attenborough within this tradition. (Attenborough co wrote the text with McNaughton, who drew all the pictures.) The book begins with rabbit leaving behind his neat, gated, foliage covered house, and making his way along a rolling landscape:  \\"'It's a long way,' said Rabbit to himself, `but it's a lovely day and I shall enjoy the walk.'\\"<br /><br />In a reverse of Aesop's tale of the hare and the tortoise, it is the rabbit who takes the slow way to the eagle's party on top of a mountain.  He's invited by his friends to join them in faster modes of transportation: Fox comes by in a hot air balloon, Bear (in the Mr. Toad role) drives by on his garish read and yellow racing machine, Cat offers a lift on his spiffy motorbike, and Pig somehow gets hold of a blue-propellered helicopter: Wonderful view from up here...\\"  \\"Don't you wish you could fly, Rabbit?\\"  To each of his animal friends, the Rabbit replies similarly: \\"No, don't...I like to feel the grass springing under my feet,\\" or NO thank you Fox...I like to look at the flowers and the butterflies as I walk along.\\"<br /><br />While there is no moral to the story per se, it turns out that Rabbit has made a wise choice-both for aesthetic and practical purposes. When Fox accidentally crashed into Pig in midair, a chain reaction of (unfortunate) events tangles every machine-driven animal into a crash on the road. Fortunately, the animals are all ok, although their machines will need quite a lot of repair. The animals all walk up to eagles lavish mountaintop estate, trailing Rabbit, who gets there first.<br /><br />This is a clever twist on the classical tale of the speedy rabbit, and the illustrations and text somewhat recall the writers mentioned above (although not with the same enduring quality).  Occasionally, the authors depart form the shaded soft look of their predecessors, especially in the crash scene. Still, the updated look retains some of the feeling, and various modes of travel and their ultimate (safe) crash will delight its young audience.will need quite a lot of repair.

Pilkey's Humor for the Toddler Set	Dav Pilkey departs from his wonderfully silly and scatalogically inclined \\"Captain Underpants\\" books in the Big Dog and Little Dog series, but displays his usual clever humor in this colorful book for toddlers.  It's a chapter book with five brief stories (similar to the \\"George and Martha\\" books), in which a very big dog a and very small dog share adventures, many of which get them in trouble with their owner.  For example, they have nothing to play with, so they devour a couch; they mistake a skunk for a cat, and arrive home, all stinky, just in time to ruin a party; they play in the mud and spray the owner with mud and water (they take a bath, and \\"are clean and dry. Now they want to go for another walk\\").<br /><br />The color pictures are bright and playful, and Pilkey has interesting compositions:  The focus is always on the dogs-sometimes the owner is only partially shown. There is lots of action, and Pilkey uses  solid backgrounds painted with acrylics as well as accent patterns to create interest and texture. The organization is superb as well; two simple two simple stories that show the two differently-sized dogs showing canine compassion and affection for each other bracket the three mischievous stories.  These are warm and touching, and perhaps a message for young siblings that shared needs and feelings can overcome differences.

Famed author Laura Numeroff (\\"If You Give A Mouse a Cookie\\") and illustrator David McPhail (\\"Pigs Ahoy\\") team in this clever story about going incognito.  Our young hero dons an outrageous facemask whenever he's in a risky situation.  His disguise is in the \\"cheapo cheapo\\" tradition of the \\"Groucho\\" mask, but with a large reddish moustache and beard, a gigantic red nose, and ultra cool black-rimmed, green tinted glasses. The unnamed low-tech spy (yet another trick in his spy plan?) goes undercover when faced with such precarious situations as a visit to the dentist's office, a dinner with lima beans, bath time (\\"You might want to add a different hat\\"), and when relatives come (\\"Then they won't pinch your cheek and say \\"My, how you've grown.\\").<br /><br />The text and watercolor pictures share a sly, droll humor. The disguise is certain to fool no one, but its fun to watch the young boy try:  He puts on the mask while playing hide-and-seek, and leans against a tree, assuring us \\"you won't have to bother looking for a place to hide.\\"  Two feet away another boy looks at him with a puzzled expression.  He gets into only one potentially dangerous situation when a \\"bully\\" stands in front of his school bus, but the bus driver looks on and makes sure he passes untouched (just in case the disguise isn't enough).<br /><br />Throughout most of the book, Numeroff and McPhail keep an adult nearby, and the warm big-faced portraits convey protection and love.  The boy has a lot of fun fooling his friends and relatives, but his blatant flouting of social convention is transparent and safe. A little rebellion can be good for you, but even little James Bond admits (while being tucked in for the night), \\"...at the end of the day it's nice to know that you're still you.\\"  This is a very fun and inviting book that almost any young sleuth will want to have close at hand.	2005-03-12

For example, we could code quitting smoking as a '1' and not quitting as a '0'.  Your outcome (a 1 or a 0 on smoking) may be related (in this hypothetical example) to frequency of smoking, smoking history, physiological and/or psychological features, treatment, or other factors. Logistic regression is used both to describe and to predict such outcomes. The book states this definition once, though not as clearly as the preceeding, then takes off into the mathematics:<br /><br />\\"This logistic regression equation models the logit transformation of the ith individual's event probability, p(subscript i) as a linear function of the explanatory variables in the vector, x (subscript i).\\"<br /><br />The text gets much more difficult than that.<br /><br />The SAS Institute's manual on 'Logistic Regression' is most useful for people who already understand a great deal of the rationale and the statistics behind logistic regression.  For them, the book's main advantage is its explanation of printed output, and coverage of several related topics. Most importantly, it provides problem examples related to logistic regression, and annotated SAS programs to solve them.<br /><br />Even the easiest sections of the book assume at least a college-level background in stats, and many sections seem to require post-graduate expertise.  There is very little explanation or teaching going on here, and the chapters on various log. reg. applications are simply too brief to learn from.  At its most general level, then, it's a user guide for understanding output. For the the very experienced, it's a reference for interpreting output, as a template for writing task-specific SAS log. reg. programs, and for understanding and choosing among various SAS logistic regression techniques.  Even experienced users will find some of the explanations lacking, however. For example, the chapter on ROC analysis is out of date, and cites two refences only (the most recent of which is from 1982).  Given that this is a growing statistical area, this is just not enough. Other areas are give adequate, although short explanations, and would be quite useful for someone wanting a quick reference.<br /><br />The book provides nine sample datasets dealing with comsumer choice and medical data. Topics and \\"examples\\" include fitting a binary logistic regression model, computing confidence limits, computing customized odds ratios, computing predicted probabilities and classifying observations, creating classification tables, using model selection methods in logistic regression, computing fit tests, producing regression diagnostics, correcting for overdispersion, displaying an ROC curve, ordinal responses, 1:1 matched Data, N:M matched data, fitting interactions, estimating discrete choice probabilities with a mulitnomial logit model, probit analysis for estimating an LD50, and fitting a Bradley-Terry model for paired comparisons. Hopefully, the preceeding list will give you an idea of whether this book is right for you.ll find some of the explanations lacking, however.

He sneaks it into the hotel where he and his father work, and the hotel employees keep the duck's presence a secret. However, when the hotel manager finds the duck swimming with some \\"decoy\\" ducks (there for an upcoming duck hunt) in the hotel fountain, he gives young Edward 30 days to train all the ducks to march to the fountain each day, stay there swimming, and then duly leave in the evening.  Because of his determination, the ducks succeed, and the Edward man gets his wish of a shiny uniform--similar to what his hero John Philip Sousa might have worn.  It's a very good story with familiar Polacco elements: The triumph of the underdog, the resolution of conflict seeded in race, class, and age, and the fun, loopy drawings.<br /><br />However, this book is unusual--and noteworthy--for the subtle yet direct hits on the nasty and virulent social climate of that time.  Polacco's illustrations of the somewhat ramshackle farm are benignly pastoral in sharp contrast to her portrayal of the  Memphis hotel.  The relatively wealthy white patrons and manager clientele are distorted rather than \\"loopy,\\" with an appearance of corpulence and a suggestion of piggish consumption. The heavy makeup adds to this general air of decadence, and the pictures are almost grotesque, reminiscent of George Grosz, the German Expressionist artist and master of class-based social criticism.<br /><br />The stocky, stern Mr. Schutt becomes a much more callous and dangerous man, evolving from a curmudgeonly but \\"good\\" manager who calls Edward \\"my boy,\\" to a threatening, gun-toting representative of the ruling class  who later just uses the pejorative \\"boy.\\" And the reward?  A shiny uniform--instead of firing his two employees in the middle of the Depression.  Lest you think I am exaggerating, note how the hunters (who enter the hotel with their live \\"decoy ducks,\\" designed to attract ducks that the hunters will kill) are all white, as are the guests here in the segregated South, the head chef, and the clerk, the first-line representative of the hotel.<br /><br />Whether she intended it or not, Polacco lets a sinister underside slip through the warmth of her story, and there is a sleight of hand in her illustrations and narrative:  Now it's a gentle story about a young man's dream--now it's a parable about the ugly side of human nature in general, and the beginnings of Depression era fanaticism in particular.  This is an interesting and provocative story that will evoke varying reactions from its readers.  Suitable for young children, and, on a different level, for their parents as well.y, stern Mr. Schutt becomes a much more callous and dangerous man, evolving from a curmudgeonly but \\"good\\" manager who calls Edward \\"my boy,\\" to a threatening, gun-toting representative of the ruling class  who later just uses the pejorative \\"boy.\\" And the reward?

The story involves Maisy, a yellow bird with a blue hair bow (\\"Tallulah\\"), and a large elephant (\\"Eddie\\") wearing orange swimming trunks with a blue and white daisy pattern.  These three want to take a dip in an inflatable swimming pool on a hot day.  However, not only does the inflatable spring a leak, but its not big enough for the two smaller animals when Eddie climbs in. The animals find their way to a happy and satisfying resolution.<br /><br />Lucy Cousins' illustrations add immensely to her story's appeal. Using rich, vivid colors, she draws her characters wearing toddler clothing--and big smiles. \\"Maisy's Pool\\" is 21 pages long. Each of the 10 two-page spreads (there's a one-page biographical piece on Cousins after the story) has large-font, bold text on a white background on the left side, and bright, cheerful gouache pictures on the right.

Author Emily Jenkins and illustrator AnnaLaura Cantone team up to produce one of the most imaginative books of 2004. \\"My Favorite Thing (According to Alberta)\\" features a memorable hero who discloses a number of strongly held idiosyncratic beliefs and preferences.  She is indeed \\"a girl of particular tastes.\\"  Alberta talks not only about the things she likes (but is one of these her \\"favorite?\\" the book asks), but also about things she doesn't like (and even something that frightens her), and this can get humorously complicated. Throughout the book, Jenkins mixes her third-person narration with Alberta's authentic-sounding monologue:<br /><br />Narrator: \\"Dogs are not her favorite thing.\\"<br />Alberta: \\"'I do not like large ones that drool, but small ones that keep their tongues in their mouths are okay,' explains Alberta.\\"<br /><br />Narrator: \\"Lots of people don't appreciate baths, but Alberta likes to soak in the tub for hours.\\"<br />Alberta: \\"'I stay until my feet look prune-y,' she says. `I have three rubber sharks.'\\"<br /><br />There's something both precocious and yet quite real about a youngster with such definite ideas. However, Alberta comes across simply as someone who knows herself, and as long as she's being asked, she's doesn't hesitate to share with the reader (even though you might not always approve \\"If I could never brush my teeth again, that would be fine with me,\\" she informs us, although her mother makes sure that she does!  So what is Alberta's favorite thing?  WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD. For someone who feels confident enough to tell all this personal information, it is perhaps not surprising that \\"My favorite thing is...ME!\\"<br /><br />This is a very funny book that realistically captures the thoughts and feelings of the egocentric very young (and I mean that in the nicest way possible).  The creative story encourages self-esteem through self-expression, and is not at all message- heavy.<br /><br />AnnaLaura Cantone's wonderful illustrations look like collages with cut painted paper, perhaps color-reproduced pictures, and fanciful perspective-jarring compositions and figures (including a dog with a studded collar, a cat with a very long snout, and a bird who almost always has something perched on its head). There's a great deal of action, color, and movement in the pictures, and these, combined with slightly untidy lines and squiggles, give a wonderfully chaotic quality that represents Alberta's individuality and fast-paced inner life.  They resemble something Ralph Steadman might draw if he were restricted to G-rated pictures. Recommended very highly for those who like humor, unconventionality, and the raw, unadorned truth of a young girl who speaks her mind.s color-reproduced pictures, and fanciful perspective-jarring compositions and figures (including a dog with a studded collar, a cat with a very long snout, and a bird who almost always has something perched on its head).

Mr. and Mrs. Harbottle were each awarded half of Esmerelda the pig upon their divorce.  Mr. Harbottle (\\"a horrid man with uncombed hair and dirty fingernails\\") wants his half served on a plate, preferably with gravy. To him, Esmeralda is just a plateful of sausage waiting to happen.<br /><br />Harbottle and some young toughs steal the pig and head over to the \\"Pig and Whistle\\" pub.  They lose time debating how to divide the poor pig to ensure that each former partner gets exactly half.  Two kids, a dashing young policeman, and a chase through an English town later, Esmerelda escapes and the thieves are caught.<br /><br />\\"Like the Pied (pig ) Piper she led those villains ( by the noose , as it were) across a couple of gardens...back at last full circle to her own home patch...\\"  The linked footnote reads: \\"Yes, I know, 'straight and true' and 'full circle,' but somehow it feels right.\\"<br /><br />Allan Ahlberg writes some other droll humor into this elliptical story, and daughter Jessica Ahlberg captures the reader's eye with various arrows, diagrams, and other objects, and diagrams mixed into her otherwise soft illustrations. However, there's a somewhat heavy-handed approach at unconventionality--addressing the audience in the first person, self-referential statements about the book and about writing, some offbeat throwaway humor--that is geared more towards young adults than towards kids.  Both the story and the bits about inserting interesting words here and there seem most appropriate for a younger audience.<br /><br />This is an ambitious book that strives for innovation and modernity. At times, it succeeds. I found, however, that the author's disengaged tone and the disunity of the illustrations works against any emotional involvement with the pig, the people, or the narrative. Interesting elements are trotted out (and some people will enjoy these), but the story as a whole is subordinate to them.em.	2005-02-27

Books	4	44	50	N	N	4 1/2  To Have and Have Not	A pigeon about to joyously eat a hot dog is constantly interrupted by a young duck who manages to upset his meal plans.  The duckling--all big-eyed charm and flirtation-repeatedly insinuates himself into the situation with \\"innocent\\" comments and questions just when the pigeon is about to take the first bite:<br /><br />\\"I've never had a hot dog before...<br /><br />What do they taste like?\\"<br /><br />The pigeon enthusiastically describes the exquisite nature of hot dogs, but then draws back, suspicious of the duckling's true motives, and feeling trapped by his own gusto.  Then, just when he's about to eat that hot dog again, the duck asks, \\"Would you say it tastes like chicken?\\"<br /><br />The baffled, frustrated pigeon looks out from the page and addresses the audience directly: \\"Can you believe this guy?\\"  Finally, overcome by the duck's seeming innocence but persistent curiosity, he goes completely wild, yelling, pacing, trying to persuade himself that the hot dog is his too eat, but aware that his \\"guest\\" will not leave him alone.  The two birds finally do share the hot dog, although the duckling belies his supposed naivet&eacute; with his final comment: \\"Hmmm...needs mustard.\\"<br /><br />Although very simple, the story has its roots in the classic comedy routines of vaudeville and early television. I can picture \\"Ralph Kramden\\" (in the pigeon role, of course) and \\"Ed Norton\\" in a similar setup.  A more recent example of this patter is in the movie \\"Diner,\\" when the Paul Reiser character asks without really asking for a ride home, some left-over food, etc. \\"Just ask the question!\\" shouts an exasperated Daniel Stern.<br /><br />Mo Willems reinforces the simplicity of this routine through his amateur-on-purpose drawings of the two birds and the solid color backgrounds. Aside from his beak, the pigeon's head is merely two concentric circles, a large dot, a line, and some shading.  As another reviewer noted, the kid-scrawl drawing is in the spirit of \\"Spongebob Squarepants\\" and primitive illustrations.<br /><br />Ultimately, this book is best read aloud to very young children.  Willems could have added some interesting geometric background shapes, or deepened the characterizations, but he kept it fairly plain and linear. It's up to the reader's dramatic abilities to pull out all the humor inherent in the conflict between owner and would-be owner. Willem's teasing dialogue and portrayal of the unwinding pigeon give adults plenty of comic material to work with.quarepants\\" and primitive illustrations. <br /> <br />Ultimately, this book is best read aloud to very young children.

McPhail's soft circular illustrations recall the Beatrix Potter books, as do the two animals at the center of the story.  Jack, a jackrabbit, goes to Rick the bear's tree to play, but Rick is sick.  Jack wants to help, but when he gives Rick something warm to drink it's too hot, and when he brings him a bag of ice to cool down, Rick is too cold. In a slightly confusing scene, Jack sits on Rick's chest to warm him up after the ice (which went between Rick's body and the covers).  The helpful Jack finally gets so tired that he takes a nap with his bear friend, the bear looking fondly (and with a trace of bemusement) at his friend with one eye open.<br /><br />The story is 14 pages long, with two sentences on every other page. . An additional five pages include an activity (make a \\"friendship award\\"), five questions about the story, and a page about David McPhail (which shows a recovered Rick playing jump rope with his pal Jack). Recommended by the publishers for ages 4 to 6, first grade, \\"Guided Reading Level--D,\\" and \\"Reading Recover Level-6.\\" First-graders and older kids may also enjoy hearing books from McPhail's very funny pig series, including \\"Pigs Ahoy,\\" and \\"Pigs Galore.\\"	2005-02-25

And so it is with Mr. Maxwell. Every day, at precisely 12:45 pm, he walks amongst the other cats to the dignified \\"Paw and Claw\\" dining establishment for his midday lunch of baked mouse. He is a somewhat stuffy cat, full of secret ambition, and both pride and power burst through his 3-piece herringbone suit.  Today, he is particularly proud because of his promotion to Vice Manager of Efficiency Control, and it is partly for this reason that he decides to order a fresh mouse and to kill it himself.<br /><br />The live mouse, served on a single slice of rye bread with a garnish of parsley, arrives relaxed and talkative. When the mouse sneezes due to the salt and pepper showering him, Mr. Maxwell says \\"Gesundheit,\\" and the mouse thanks him.  \\"Mr. Maxwell appreciated the compliment, but said nothing more.  His mother had always advised him not to fraternize with the food.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Maxwell is up against a formidable mouse, however, who elicits his pity and admiration, even as the cat's fork holds him down and his knife is perilously close to cutting. The mouse assures him that he doesn't want to escape, but his 5-hankie prayer, his advice on which wine would go best with mouse, and his empathy for Maxwell's difficulty in going for the kill earn the cat's trust.  This is the cat's eventual undoing, as the mouse tricks him, frees the other mice, and sends Maxwell to the hospital with a bloody tail.<br /><br />Asch sets a Gothic tone early, with the cold green d&eacute;cor and the grayish-green pallor of the cats and the dark greys of the formal club.  The computer-generated graphics also lend a cold, odd cast to the illustrations.  On one gruesome page, Asch depicts the mouse almost facing us, with a fork and knife millimeters away from their fatal work.  While the ending is wild and liberating, we see some blood (his own) flowing down Maxwell's tail as he lets out a painful scream.  This quirky book, full of gloomy, threatening imagery, expressionist close-ups and long shots, the specter of mousicide, and class (or, at least, inter-species) warfare (complete with sharp knife and let blood) is for older elementary school children and up.

Books	5	17	18	N	N	Pigs Gone Wild	I became a big fan of David McPhail's Pig books after reading his colorful and very funny \\"Pigs Ahoy.\\"  This earlier book again chronicles the age-old theme of man vs. pig with creative rhymes, chaotic scenes, and vivid, imaginative illustrations.<br /><br />Our hero is a 30-something male who may or may not be dreaming his encounter with a gang of messy, loud pigs: McPhail cleverly leaves open the possibility that his house isn't really inhabited by scores of \\"black pigs, white pigs, Brown and pink pigs, Making-oatmeal-in-the-sink pigs.\\"  In any event, these apparently nocturnal pigs are busy riding skateboards, dressing up, playing in a band, and ordering 50 pizzas! McPhail's rhymes are simple but clever, and he throws in an old favorite just for good measure:<br /><br />Pigs from England,<br /><br />Pigs from France,<br /><br />Pigs in just<br /><br />Their underpants.<br /><br />When the young man reads the huge pizza bill, he decides he's had his fill.  The pigs beg to stay (they know a good thing when they see it) and he relents, but only if they'll clean up after themselves. Pigs will be pigs, however, and even the cleanup is full of mishaps, messes, and (one suspects) some intentional mischief. Every page of this colorful action-packed book is funny and creative. In one section, McPhail draws gigantic pigs towering over the others, their snouts proud, and their robes loud:<br /><br />The King of Pigs<br /><br />The Piggy Queen-<br /><br />The biggest pigs<br /><br />I've ever seen.<br /><br />On the next two pages, dozens of pigs arrive at the house by ship, train, airplane (from which the pigs parachute), and \\"pigmobile.\\"  I thought that the narrative is not as clever as in \\"Pigs Ahoy,\\" this is more Three Stooges than Marx Brothers. Still, if you just like zany, uncomplicated stories with outrageous pictures, or if you like pigs, or even if you're kind of like a pig yourself, this will fast become a favorite.	2005-02-25

Graffiti covers her apartment building wall and barbed wire tops it, a broken auto rusts away on the opposing sidewalk, and trash--some in bags, some scattered by the wind--lays everywhere.  Even at night, the grey-brown cityscape tones are a convincing argument for urban renewal. Granny's apartment is a little more personal, but shares in the general dilapidation.  Moreover, Granny is too scared to let her visitors walk around on play on the fire escape, and has the neighborhood horror stories to prove it.  For the kids, it's a veritable prison.<br /><br />As the children try to sleep, author/illustrator Cole begins a very subtle shift towards a dream narrative. For one thing, the three grandchildren find a forth pair of feet (mysterious!) in their bed, and a figure who suddenly appears in a mirror grabs a robe-and disappears. Three pages later, any subtlety is gone: Disappearing under their covers,<br /><br />\\"..up they came in the witch's bed<br />where the granny-witch was fast asleep.<br />At that very moment, the bed gave a lurch and<br />floated out the window into Queen Street.\\"<br /><br />With the scary city beneath them, Maggie and Katie and little Nora engage in some \\"lucid dreaming,\\" willing their nightmare into a good dream. They dream of \\"white sails\\" and \\"great birds soaring\\" and \\"pancakes and syrup and doughnuts and tea in a garden of flowers near a house by the sea...\\"<br /><br />Apparently, the scared and defensive Granny shares in this dream, because when she wakes up (with a smile!) she announces a breakfast of pancakes, syrup, doughnuts, and tea. The neighborhood looks different when they wake up:  It appears cleaner and more appealing; the presence of city workers shows tax dollars finally at work. And Granny is freed up to show the kinds the dance she \\"learned long ago, when I danced with the Prince in fair Monaco.\\"<br /><br />It's difficult to know what to make of this book.  Older, poor people need kids to release them from entrenched, imprisoning thoughts? Younger, scared people can dream themselves into a refreshed mood?  Is that Sigmund Freud and a young Granny appearing on the page where Maggie says, \\"Don't be afraid?\\" Did psychotropics and/or a good night's sleep take the edge off?  I really don't know--Cole offers no discernable point of view or lesson. While that admirably leaves the book's conclusion to the reader's interpretation, it doesn't really offer any clues about how to cope with the very real problems of feeling lonely, poor, and vulnerable. It's clear that Cole is an accomplished illustrator; his watercolor washes capture both atmosphere and detail, and he cleverly interweaves the dream sequence with the gritty reality. However, I think his resolution of get-away dreamscapes and abrupt transformations is simplistic and unconvincing.  Perhaps the \\"message\\" is as simple as this:  Getting a good night's sleep, coupled with the energy and imagination of teens and children is as good an antidote to living in poverty as you're going to get.It's difficult to know what to make of this book.

Perhaps the \\"message\\" is as simple as this:  Getting a good night's sleep, coupled with the energy and imagination of teens and children is as good an antidote to living in poverty as you're going to get.	2005-02-16

David McPhail tells a tale of mythic proportion in another one of his popular pig books.  Creative rhymes, chaotic scenes, and bright, imaginative illustrations make this one wild and rebellious adventure.  Here, a young yuppie-type leaves for an ocean excursion, his blonde hair slicked back, and a tropical shirt covering his pale skin. He holds two suitcases, one of which has a \\"ROAM\\" travel decal.<br /><br />But our would-be anti hero (he wears a shirt proclaiming \\"Just Don't Do It\\") is no match for the real Wild Bunch, a sty-full of pigs who have taken over his stateroom (so crowded it resembles that of the Marx Brothers), and seemingly every activity on every deck of the giant liner:<br /><br />\\"After breakfast I recline<br />Until aerobics class at nine.<br />The pigs prefer to exercise<br />While eating burgers, shakes, and fries.\\"<br /><br />They take over the swimming pool and \\"race their pudgy motorboats,\\" they enter the boiler room (\\"where pigs are not supposed to go\\") and paint stripes on the pipes. FOr some reason, they're invited to the Captain's table. The pigs, inappropriately dressed to the nines (wearing Victorian clothes, loud checkered coats, patched shirts, gaudy jewelry), and they even make our hero look like a respectable decked-out suited hippie. Things predictably--and hilariously--go berserk:<br /><br />\\"The table's soon piled high with food.<br />(The Captain's in an angry mood.)<br />A piggy swings a baseball bat.<br />And knocks a meatball towards his hat.\\"<br /><br />The vividly colored, riotous frolicking continues to the delight of the pigs and the consternation of the humans, until the latter throw the former into lifeboats. As they row towards shore, the porcine ones call out cheekily: \\"Hey, Captain, let's do lunch!\\"<br /><br />All is calm on board without the snouted ones. Maybe too calm. Our thirty-something hero realizes that he didn't need just an escape, he needed the messy, antisocial, glorious fun that only pigs can provide. His eventual reunion with this motley crew is a happily disorganized one.n provide. His eventual reunion with this motley crew is a happily disorganized one.	2005-02-14

This book resembles the old western train ride at Disneyland before they transformed it into \\"Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.\\"  The opening pages have the same desert canyon terrain and hues of tan, umber, gold, yellow, orange, and purple.  Illustrator Ashley Wolff places mountain goats in strategic locations (e.g., on top of boulders and natural terraces), an armadillo and a chipmunk read on top of a cactus, and pigs fish off a bridge.  You almost expect one of the animals to jump off the page, slowly turned its head at you, and talk in an electronic voice. This is not a criticism, however; the relaxed tone and elements of fantasy tell you not to take it too seriously.<br /><br />A cowboy-hatted, banjo-playing frog starts singing \\"She'll be comin' `round the mountain when she comes,\\" and we see a red and white camper truck slowly approaching over wooden bridges and through cement tunnels.  As we view the frog in the foreground, and the almost mythic John Ford-like western landscape in the background, we can also look \\"down\\" at the old town nestled at the bottom of these mountains. Illustrator Wolff`s pictures capture a perspective as wide and long as the canyon itself.<br /><br />The story slowly unfolds through the frog's modified song lyrics, the activities in the old town, and the tension built through the approaching truck.  We learn gradually that the animals are preparing for a big reception in the town center and cleaning up the best room in town to get ready when the mysterious \\"she\\" comes.  Food is very, very important too: The skunks, foxes, and other animals are getting the salsa, rice, candy and other food ready:<br /><br />\\"We'll cook her favorite taco while she's here.<br /> We'll mash an avocado while she's here.<br /> We'll make an enchilada and a lovely ensalada,<br /> Then we'll all drink fruitilada while she's here.\\"<br /><br />In a wild scene again reminiscent of Disneyland, the critters are shown singing, dancing, and generally whooping it up on an adobe house decorated with red chilies--just as the camper truck is on the home stretch to town. Finally, we're at the climax. Everybody is singing and eating, dancing and snuggling, roasting marshmallows and even reading when the big truck rolls into late night \\"Reederville.\\" Finally, we're about to find the answer to the big question: Just who have they been waiting and preparing and celebrating for, what is that truck, and who is driving it?<br /><br />In a truly great surprise ending, we find out the driver is a pig, and the truck in a bookmobile named the \\"Six White Horses.\\"  The animals wait in line as the brightly dressed pig hands out books, and the bookmobile is decorated with bumper stickers such as, \\"If You Can Read This, Thank a Teacher!\\"  Twenty-eight colorful and rollicking pages, with an afterward that tells the origin of the song. One of 2004's best books; you'll have lots of fun reading this enchanting story aloud or to yourself.--just as the camper truck is on the home stretch to town. Finally, we're at the climax.

Sally, who is perhaps a black lab mix, is bored inside the house, where the people's homework, urgent memos, passports, old socks, and underwear surround her. Thrilled by a weather change, she goes outside and plays chase with her buddy, tabby cat Bingo. She's so excited that she doesn't see a tree stump, and she falls over, hurt.<br /><br />She's rushed to the vet (\\"The nurse explains that 'vet' is short for doctor of veterinary medicine.\\"), where she receives an x-ray (shown to the reader, there are no apparent broken bones), eye, mouth, and stethoscope exams (great close-ups here), and--a shot in the butt! This latter concerns her. When told to think of a happy thought, we see her closed eyes imagining a strawberry ice cream cone! \\"It really works! I hardly feel a thing.\\" While resting in front of a fireplace with her best pal Bingo, Sally relays her story and the doctor's advice about happy thoughts. In a nice touch, Bingo is shown lying on big Sal's back, thinking of her doggy pal. The book may help allay children's fears of vets, and perhaps of their own doctor visits. While imagining a happy thought may not be sufficient for a young boy or girl, the book at least suggests that there are ways to manage your fears.<br /><br />The highlights are probably the colorful, glossy, woodcut illustrations, a superb mix of big bold colors and detailed patterns that suggest texture and depth. Huneck seems to enjoy this mode so much that he devotes an opening paragraph in the \\"artist's note\\" to an explanation of technique, as well as a grateful note to vets everywhere. This 30-page work is one of those big picture books with simple text that will please toddlers and early readers as well.	2005-02-11

The prose is rhythmic, jazzy, and fun to read, and the watercolor illustrations display great texture, dimension, and emotion.<br /><br />Although the situation is dramatic, the author and the illustrator take their time telling the story.  There are no explosive moments or insights, just the little details of the everyday, set against a larger background of recent American history.  Harry notices Mr. Baker's crumpled shoes and how they're always tied, the suspenders of his pants, and how the leaves float and swoop in the chilly morning air (the two sitting on porch, hugging their knees) as they wait for the schoolbus.<br /><br />Mr. Baker's wife comes out, and in two subtle but evocative pages Hest and Muth suggest their relationship. Against a soft as memory background of a New Orleans style jazz band, we discover that George Baker \\"is a drummer man, and some people say he's famous.\\"  After the bus delivers them to school, Mr. Baker and the school children sit comfortably together with a common goal:<br /><br />\\"'We can do it,' says George after school...<br /><br />his lips sound out the letters.<br /><br />Real slow. But his fingers fly across his knees. Like a big old drum.\\"<br /><br />Telling a simple but beautiful story with heart and dignity, this book can be appreciated by readers (and almost-readers) of just about any age. Great production values by publisher Candlewick: Thick paper, easily read letters in \\"Integrity\\" font, and big, easy-going pictures. Very highly recommended!	2005-02-10

Somehow, that bear becomes a gigantic real bear, and the humongous real bear rides his own tiny little yellow bicycle along side the boy.<br /><br />The wise boy explains (and the illustration show) traffic rules that he follows whenever he rides (and there are some useful ones: watching for opening doors, looking both ways, etc.).  The bear does not follow the rules.  He gets into accidents and mishaps, but his size and the author's good taste keep him from any trips to the hospital.  Author McLeod and illustrator McPhail manage to show the danger without scaring us, and, indeed, with a bit of humor.<br /><br />This is an enormously appealing little book. The symmetrical structure contrasting the boy's cautious, safe ride, versus the bear's slapstick miscues. This organization and the single sentence in each two-page example clearly explain each imp0rtant rule of the road. The illustrations by the renowned McPhail are warm and welcoming, soft and soothing, yet funny. You don't have to know how to ride a bike to enjoy this masterpiece of simplicity and imagination.	2005-02-10

There are ponies to ride and cornfields in which to play, but there are also  \\"lots and lots of chores\\" to do.  Ike and Mem enjoy the fun stuff, but the grandkids-especially Ike-aren't very happy about the difficult farm chores.  It's a fairly prosaic story but younger readers will identify with complaints and rewards around work, and may enjoy the subplot about the mysterious sounds emanating from the cornfield.<br /><br />The dialogue and description convey personality and setting, but the author overplays his hand. The grandparent characters border on stereotypes: the mischievous, joke-telling (bad jokes, of course) grandfather, and the nurturing (especially with food), but stern and sometimes very gruff grandmother.  The two constantly insert the word \\"best\\" in their  demands (e.g., \\"Best get on out to the cornfield.\\") and forever talking in \\"rural\\" clich&eacute;s. Apparently, farm folks always speak the same.  This provides some humor,  as Ike begins to copy the best phrase.  (The cynical among us would believe that his word choice is sarcastic.)  Some other spots of humor will promote interest. I don't think that the suggested age range of 9-13 is right; this book is perhaps more suited to a younger age range.<br /><br />The black and white drawings are adequate but largely unimaginative, and the period farmhouse looks like a modern condo in  the mountains.  Early readers will enjoy the word repetition, the feeling of reading a grown-up book (55 pages, with un-numbered chapter breaks), the conflict over tasks, and the mystery in the cornfield.  However, the dialogue feels contrived, and the surprise ending is fairly predictable (although there is a very clever twist that may require re-reading to make sure the author didn't trick you. This is the fifth \\"Ike and Mem\\" book.	2005-02-10

I'm not sure, but it almost seems like James Stevenson, the superb author of many children's books, was going for the motif that Don Freeman used so beautifully in \\"Corduroy:\\" The lost or tattered stuffed animal without a home.  The problem with Stevenson's \\"The Night After Christmas\\" is that it veers too sharply towards the bleak.  Teddy the stuffed bear and Annie the doll have very little expression in their faces, and so it is becomes that much more difficult for the reader to identify with them.  The weather is unrelentingly cold and blustery and the disarray of the neighborhood is very apparent.  The bear and the doll are unhappy. Of course, who would be, tossed out into the garbage by kids who got fancier presents. \\"Want to sing `Jingle Bells'?\\" said Teddy. \\"Not right now,\\" said Annie.<br /><br />They are rescued by a scruffy terrier mix who warms them in a basement full of some neat looking pipes and gizmos. Even the dog, Chauncey, is having a rough time:<br /><br />\\"I'll play with you,\\" said Chauncey.<br />Thanks, said Teddy, \\"but I meant children.\\"<br />\\"Nothing personal,\\" said Annie.<br />\\"That's O.K.\\" said Chauncey, \\"I'm not much for games anyway. I run, bark, and wag my tail. That's about it.\\"<br /><br />Chauncey tries to cheer them up, but they won't have any of it, and are actually a bit rude to him.  Still, Chauncey cleverly finds homes for the thrown away gifts, and he is left with sleeping with his food bowl (mysteriously festooned with a red ribbon), alone again to face the mean streets of the city. I thought the tone should have been moderated with some of Stevenson's trademark dry humor, but the book is simply sad. Our son didn't want it re-read to him, and so any \\"message\\" here didn't was lost.  An unusual book, I would recommend almost anything else by Stevenson, including the \\"Worst\\" series, and the books featuring \\"Grandpa\\" and \\"Wainey.\\"	2005-02-08

One pair is human, and the other pair is bear!.  As they proceed up opposite sides of rolling hill covered in blueberries, each member of the species copies the other:  The moms focus on the task at hand, remembering the harsh winter ahead; the children (\\"Little Sal\\" and \\"Little Bear\\") focus on the immediate pleasures of eating blueberries--so much so, that each gets lost.<br /><br />In a deftly portrayed switch, McCloskey shows the Little Bear following Little Sal's mom, and Little Sal following the Little Bear's mom. The two lost children are unafraid of following the mismatched grown-ups (ok, so McCloskey takes some liberties in this very light book).  Eventually the two moms turn around and see who is following:  Little Bear's mother discovers Sal and turns away:  (\\"She was old enough to be shy of people, even a very small person like Little Sal.\\")  Meanwhile, Little Sal's mom discovers Little Bear, and the mother back away:  (\\"She was old enough to be shy of bears, even very small bears like Little Bear.\\")  Each pair reunites and returns home, with an adventure and berries to savor over the winter.<br /><br />McCloskey's deep blue-black drawings complement the appealing symmetry and innocence of the book, and the period furnishings, uncluttered landscape, and fashions add to the book's sentimental and enduring attraction.  This is a very good bedtime story for little ones who can appreciate an affectionate and tender book.	2005-02-08

They offer completely outlandish excuses for being late to school (pirates, a plague of frogs!), but realize that they need to find a way to get there on time.  Wendell (who, perhaps in homage to early comics, looks very much like one of the Katzenjammer kids of 1897) has an idea: He and Floyd will take \\"the secretest shortcut of them all...In fact, I invented it myself.\\"<br /><br />After scrambling though a thicket of vines, Wendell and Floyd find that their shortcut leads to a jungle! Two-page color spread shows the boys maneuvering past leopards, peacocks, and tapirs, rhinos, and snake; traveling a narrow path across \\"quicksand swamps and sleeping crocodiles,\\" and then over a \\"deep, rocky gorge.\\" Seeing that the shortcut is taking as long, if not longer, than the \\"longcut,\\" the boys swing Tarzan-like from vines until the vines run out and they land in a muddy lake.<br /><br />Although the wild diversion through the jungle is humorous and sometimes exciting, the book is a bit one-dimensional: They're traveling through a jungle, it's true, but they see typical jungle creatures and terrain.  Some of the illustrations lacked depth because of insufficient shadowing, although I like the multiple perspectives from which Teague draws the boys.  The conclusion, which comes quickly, is also a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The book might have been more compelling if the boys had encountered as much of the improbable on the shortcut as they did on their usual route (for example, the plague of frogs).  The monkey-mimicking vine swinging, ending with the disgruntled boys \\"in a giant puddle of mud\\" is a nice surprise, but a more ridiculous progression of events, perhaps told straight a la Daniel Pinkwater would have been funnier and more interesting.	2005-02-03

On the night of Paul Revere's famous ride, Sam accompanies his father to the village green. The pensive faces of the Minutemen and the monochrome and two-toned drawings of Lobel build tension as they await the possible arrival of the British. Finally, they hear the \\"TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP\\" of the British soldiers-the \\"lobsterbacks\\": \\"Over the hill and past the tavern came the soldiers! They came on and on and on.\\"  At close range, the British kill eight men (they're shown lying on the ground), and wound Sam's friend John in the leg. \\"'Sam!' John cried. `I'm hit.' John held his leg and fell down.\\"<br /><br />Soon after, the British attack again. Sam joins his father, despite his mother's loud protest. This time the Minutemen shoot back from behind trees and rocks. Benchley's dramatic narrative continues: \\"No one knew it then, but that day was the start of the American Revolution.\\"  Lobel shows the Minutemen's strain, the families' agony, and the fatigue of Sam and others.<br /><br />Although a simply told story intended for young readers, Benchley and Lobel convey some of the key elements that went into the eventual American victory. Perhaps a little violent for the younger audiences, this is a realistic story with the look and feeling of an archetypal children's book.	2005-02-03

I like the small size both for its portability and because it takes little room on my desk.  (This comes as a cost, however: There are just 4 lines for daily entries, and no hour markings. Conveniently, there is one week--Sunday through Monday--per page).  On every facing page there are beautiful, credited pictures of golden retrievers, young and old, in fields and by water and snow, content, serene, dignified, exuberant, unhappy, friendly, working, playing, lounging about--and all loveable. Other features include a very brief (three pages each) yearly planner for both 2005 and 2006, 14 thinly spaced note pages, and, on each page, a small view of the calendars for that month, the preceding month, and the next month.<br /><br />Sadie, the Wonder Dog, our enthusiastic ball retriever, believes that this calendar/brief planner will help us remember her daily need for 2-5 hour romps in the park, whether by us or her good friend, \\"Bryan.\\" (Not his real name, at his request.)

You'll be hungry as a hound by midmorning!\\"<br /><br />Gramma Emmaline brings a watermelon. \\"The watermelon was heavier than a full grown-raccoon in a washtub.\\"<br /><br />Some of the men happen to bring smelly items--even the ducks hold their noses: An umbrella \\"as tall as a beanpole\\" which might have some dirty socks within it,and a horse blanket which may have some horse hair. The raft loads up more and more as Uncle Binderbus and Uncle Mumpford, respectively, bring a bicycle and a chair.  Calamity ensues as the raft goes under (\\"fortunately the water was shoulder-high-shallow) and the givers focus on getting back their supplies.  There's a very happy ending, and overall, a very lightly presented lesson for the overly solicitous.<br /><br />The narrative, dialogue, and pictures are just flat-out fun. (You may find yourself doing a little regional dialect yourself after reading this one.)  It's great fun to read silently and especially to others.  The large format illustrations and exaggerated portraits give the book a tall-tale feeling but within a familiar context.

The beginning is auspicious, as the author's displays her dry humor-a la Daniel and Jill Pinkwater-as Phoebe, the older dog, teaches newcomer Buster a thing or two about bones:<br /><br />\\"When Buster came back, his bone was gone. `Why are your bones still here and mine isn't,?' he asked. `My bones are well trained, like me,' said Phoebe. `You are just a puppy. You have a puppy bone. It is not well trained.'  `Oh,' said Buster. He began to chew on the rug.\\"<br /><br />But new dogs learn new tricks quickly, as Buster begins to suspect that Phoebe has something to do with her disappearing bones. Older dogs, however, have many, many tricks up their paws, and Buster is taken for a ride again. One by one, her bones are lost. Phoebe explains that they're not smart bones! When a cement mixer swallows up a bunch of bones, Phoebe claims the remaining ones as hers, though by now Buster has learned to brand her bones with a signature X.  In the final chapter of this short book (45 pages, with only a few sentences on each page) for young readers, the upstart Buster busts Phoebe's attempt to steal yet another bone (a big one this time), and makes a friend (a very large dog).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the wry humor glimpsed at the book's outset is not maintained. While the book has some funny moments-especially for very young children-the story is feels a bit padded.  Most importantly, perhaps, the pictures are fairly flat and uninteresting-unusual for a story about dogs-although the ink and watercolor illustrations are bright and uncluttered.  Published on high quality paper by Boston's Houghton Mifflin Company, a firm where someone needs to learn how to spell Phoebe.	2005-02-01

Books	5	25	26	N	N	Harry Houdini-More than An Illusionist	If the picture on the cover is any indication, Harry Houdini is Sean Penn (there's a striking resemblance).  This is an interesting book in the \\"Who Was\\" series, detailing Houdini's impoverished boyhood in America (after emigrating from Hungary), his early interest in magic, and a turning point, his discovery of a book about Jean-Eugene Robert-Houdin, the \\"father of modern magic.\\"<br /><br />Author Sutherland divided the book into 12 chapters, each beginning with \\"So you want to be a (Magician, Pilot, Hero, Detective, etc.), detailing Houdini's feats in many areas. Several of the escape illusions are briefly explained (including Houdini's great illusion making an elephant disappear!), and there's a humorous bent as the author admits that it's difficult to tell which of Houdini's many statements about himself are true!  Houdini traveled from town to town, and it wasn't until he Martin Beck, head of the Orpheum Circuit's (a string of vaudeville houses), discovered Houdini that he earned international acclaim, staying five years in Europe.  The book does a good job at showing how Houdini worked hard at his illusions, and how this practice (and a penchant for self-promotion) catapulted him to fame. It also emphasizes the real dangers and near disasters that Houdini faced, a far cry from today's televised illusionists.<br /><br />Sutherland does a great job of providing relatively unknown information about Houdini: He was the first person to fly an airplane in Australia, his wife played an important part in his stage act, he was in five movies, and he and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the author of the Sherlock Holmes series) debated the validity of Spiritualism (Houdini thought it was an exploitative sham).  Sidebars about, for example, airplanes, movies, WWI add a historical context, During WW1, Houdini raised money for American troops, did shows for the wounded, and even taught soldiers how to escape from German handcuffs!<br /><br />This is a fascinating book that teaches a lot about Houdini and his times. Sutherland doesn't talk down to his readers, and both adults and kids will learn a great deal. The book may even begin or reinforce someone's ambition to perform magic tricks and illusions. John O'Brien's small black and white illustrations add an important measure of interest. 105 pages, with sidebars, two timelines, but no index.that teaches a lot about Houdini and his times.

They're also full of idealism.  Walter is excited that his older (age 9) cousin Howie is coming to visit: \\"Walter couldn't wait for his best friend and his favorite cousin to meet. `The three of us are going to have so much fun,' said Walter.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, Howie isn't interested in making friends with Iris.  In fact, his words are critical and his body language shows hostility and a distinct smug quality. (Illustrator Christine Davenier conveys this very well).  He even seems pleased that he's successfully placed a wedge between Iris and Walter, a wedge that Walter doesn't see.  When she overhears Howie whispering to Walter, \\"Does she have to do everything with us?,\\" Iris rides her bike home and bursts into tears.  Her supportive parents and grandfather comfort her, validate her feelings, and reassure her that she will remain Walter's best friend.  And that's exactly what happens.<br /><br />This simple, warm book touches upon friendship issues that really occur, and that can be very upsetting.  It need not be a visiting relative, this fear of replacement can happen, for example, when a best friend takes an exclusive interest in someone else for a while.  The book shows how parents and other adults can play an important comforting/listening role, and it shows kids that unpleasant, upsetting things like this often resolve themselves.  Davenier's casual pen-and-ink illustrations complement the story superbly, they are uniformly colorful, but depending on the scene, may be soft or swirly and action-filled. This 44-page book has a good pedigree, for the \\"Iris and Walter\\" books have won several awards, including a Publishers Weekly \\"Best Book of the Year.\\"  Recommended!	2005-01-31

McDuff, the irrepressible White Highland Terrier, joins owners Fred, Lucy, and their little baby for a traditional Fourth of July picnic in this immensely satisfying book.  Susan Jeffers' beautiful rich colors, blend of comic strip panels and large-format pictures, and attention to period accuracy convincingly portray the post-war patriotism, hope, and economic prosperity of the late 1940's and early 1950's.  Her drawings evoke Norman Rockwell, Boy Scout magazines, and the woodblock pictures that graced early children's books, and they are a major factor in the book's huge appeal.<br /><br />Rosemary Wells once again writes a McDuff series book with humor, warmth, and just a bit of mischief, qualities found in her famous \\"Max and Ruby\\" series (e.g., \\"Max's Dragon Shirt\\").  There's Lucy and Rick tomfoolery in the opening scenes as McDuff and Fred keep switching seats during the drive.  Finally:<br /><br />\\"Fred had to sit in the backseat with the baby and the chicken. 'He always gets the front seat in the end,' said Fred.  McDuff stretched out in the front seat and fell into a sausage-squirrel dream.\\"<br /><br />Wells and Jeffers also pull off a clever perspective switch as we see McDuff's version of how the picnic disappeared.  In McDuff's version, marauding ants \\"penetrated the picnic basket by the hundreds. In a few short minutes, the picnic was gone.\\"  We see five ants (only 5!) ferreting away a sandwich, and organized, orderly lines of ants absconding with cookies, candy, and cupcakes.  Jeffers, as masterful with facial expressions as with large-scale compositions, shows McDuff conveniently looking away, trying hard to look innocent.<br /><br />And just how does McDuff save the day?  By eating the meatballs of neighboring picnicker Mr. DiMaggio. (The authors go a little heavy on an Italian stereotype here.)  After DiMaggio yells for help, the family joins him in a generously shared, copious lunch.  As now expected from the ever-fortunate dog, McDuff gets a turkey-and tomato sandwich out of it!  A glorious fireworks display ends this idyllic Fourth, as Fred, once again, winds up in the front seat.

There's an unmistakable film noir feeling to the illustrations and the text: \\"He didn't know where he was headed--he only hoped it would be better than where he had been,\\" and \\"When night came, Wilfred stopped. He leaned against a highway sign. He shivered, and went to sleep, and dreamed he was being chased again by big dogs.\\"<br /><br />Wilfred fortuitously happens upon a seasonally closed amusement park, and his luck begins to change. There are bags of peanuts, and, most importantly, two new friends, a squirrel and chipmunk who make \\"Pleasure Beach\\" their winter hangout.  The three rodent-relatives play games, climb roller coasters, play hide-and-seek, and slide down the ice-covered slide.<br /><br />Summer comes, and the two new friends warn Wilfred that now is the time to leave. The owner isn't too fond of animals, and has a big dog to chase them. Wilfred decides to stay, and while trying to escape the dog and owner, makes a spectacular leap off the roller coaster into a pail of popcorn. As the crowd goes nuts, the owner pretends this was all planned, and offers Wilfred a lucrative job.  Now Wilfred must choose between money, fame, and the attractions of Pleasure Beach, versus returning to his newfound friends (who summer around a pizza place near the beach).  Wilfred makes the friendship choice, and the three have fun at the beach, looking forward to their return to Pleasure Beach in the winter.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of action, and the soft black and white illustrations of Pleasure Beach are enchanting and almost mystical. The black and white pictures lends complement the opening noirish aspect, but overall, I missed Stevenson's color illustrations. (There's an example on the book's cover.)  The friends' play at the close Pleasure Beach is imaginative, but the story is a bit too linear compared to the great \\"Grandpa and Wainey\\" series by Stevenson.  Still, another excellent book that will appeal those who enjoy animal stories, roller coasters and other amusement staples, and fans of Stevenson.o linear compared to the great \\"Grandpa and Wainey\\" series by Stevenson.

I'd like to thank Donald Mitchell (and Ms. Fairechild, who spoke with him) for pointing out that a much shorter, new version was published in 2003. Mitchell, who is an excellent reviewer (and connoisseur of P.G.

In addition, there are several unsubstantiated scientific claims (she provides absolutely no references or footnotes), as well as the author's personal (New Age-feeling) insights. Obviously, a revision and update were in order, kudos to the author for providing one.<br /><br />The author has written several other books available at Amazon.com, their favorable reviews are a welcome sight.	2005-01-24

Jeannie Baker's \\"Home\\" is a model for a book without text:  The pictures are compelling, the story flows easily, and there's enough intrinsic narrative to stimulate discussion.  Although much of the material is relevant to social and economic issues, the gorgeous collages and everyday scenes will appeal to infants and toddlers, as well as older siblings and adults.  Publisher Greenwillow displays its usual excellent production values.<br /><br />Baker shows the progression of a rundown neighborhood to the small city equivalent of a town square, as well as the maturation of the female protagonist (\\"Tracy\\") from newborn to mother.  Baker cleverly shows this--\\"Rear Window\\"-like-through Tracy's upper floor apartment window.  From this perspective, we view the changing interior (a window ledge and some of the wall), the adjoining backyards, and the stores and dwellings at the intersection.  When Tracy is born, the backyards and large apartment building are run-down, and graffiti (\\"DAMAGE,\\" \\"PAIN \\") reveals residents' frustration and anger.  You get the feeling that the people, too, are neglected objects.<br /><br />As the young girl grows, she and her environment begin to change.  It starts small: The girl plants some flowers, a wall is fixed, and eventually someone puts up a sign: \\"Reclaim Your Street.\\"  Gradually, more and more people enact the spirit of that sign as they rebuild their houses and yards. Residents make a small common area in a former driveway/vacant lot, and newer buildings replace old ones.  On a larger scale (one that may be appreciated by grade- and middle-school kids), economic and perhaps political forces begin to shape the neighborhood:  The apartment building is renovated, the streets are lined with plants, and a large complex in the background is torn down-revealing a beautiful lake that was previously hidden from view.  Meanwhile, the young girl makes friends, goes to school, and later falls in love, marries, and has a baby.<br /><br />The changes are gradual and believable:  They apparently spring from residents' desire to fashion a better place to live.  A couple of times, Baker \\"cheats\\" just a bit by painting the sky overcast on one page, and then a clear light blue as the intersection improves.  For the most part, however, the book doesn't take the easy way out-not everything is perfect in the end, nor is everything simply a \\"slum\\" in the beginning.  Neighborhood improvement is not necessarily equivalent to \\"neat and tidy\\" either:  By the end of the book, large, varied, and somewhat overgrown foliage blocks the view.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" is a beautiful picture book with exceptional composition and colors.  It is bright and pleasant to look at and it's fun to compare the subtle on each page.  It is also heartfelt, as Ms. Baker, in an afterward, discusses how the term \\"home\\" once encompassed the entire neighborhood.  This is a superb book that with appeal to many different age groups, each of which will experience it in a different way.  That quality makes \\"Home\\" a small treasure./>The changes are gradual and believable:  They apparently spring from residents' desire to fashion a better place to live.

Goodbye!!\\"<br /><br />The witches fly to a beach shack that's \\"damp and moldy...full of sand and spiders and ants\\"...and \\"smells of wet old towels,\\" says Lavinia. \\"It's adorable!\\"  But the witches can't leave bad enough alone. Wanting to make absolutely sure that Emma et al. are \\"miserable,\\" they fly back and dump bags of wet sand on her and her friends.  Emma's feline friend looks directly at the reader and says, \\"I say we ought to get even, if you catch my drift.\\"  With the help of her friends, including some newly recruited geese, and a shopping bag full of items bought by Emma, the victims fly to the beach to \\"get even.\\"  They manage to convince Lavinia and Dolores that there are poisonous jellyfish in the water (a -be-speckled goose with a straw hat confirms this), that they need to cover themselves in \\"anti-mosquito cream\\" (sold, of course, by one of the geese), and that a very dangerous sea monster is after them.<br /><br />While this may seem a little mean-spirited, Stevenson's casual illustrations and lettering, and his usual absurd resolution (aided by the somewhat unbelievable gullibility of the witches) give a fun, light tone to the story.  The story is best when Emma and her friends band together, and, with the most meager of resources, show what some imagination and teamwork can accomplish (on the next to last page, Stevenson explains just what Emma bought). While I didn't enjoy this as much as books in his \\"Grandpa and Wainey\\" series, Stevenson again shows his winning, offbeat sense of humor in this clever and enjoyable story.	2005-01-17

(Reading Rainbow Books)	Books	5	21	21	N	N	James Stevenson at His Best	This is one of James Stevenson's cleverest and most outrageous books, even though it follows a familiar formula:  Once again, grandchildren Mary Ann and Louie visit their unflappable \\"Grandpa\\" with a problem, and he tells them a tall tale to put things into perspective--albeit a very wacky perspective! The kids complain of a splinter, a lost kite, and a flat tire, and Grandpa responds each time with the seemingly boring \\"Could be worse...\\"  The two grandchildren think that this nonresponsive reply is due to the boring life Grandpa leads.<br /><br />It's the perfect set-up for the signature Stevenson story, in which Grandpa matter-of-factly tells them about an incredible adventure he once had. (Often these stories involve his little brother Wainey, although he does not appear in this story). Grandpa, while eating breakfast with the kids, begins\\"<br /><br />\\"Last night, when I was asleep, a large bird pulled me out of bed and took me for a long ride [the reader turns the page] and dropped me in the mountains.\\"  In this same unflappable style, Grandpa weaves together a story that includes an abominable snowman, a scaly beast who crushes him, a blob of marmalade (!) who chases him, a gigantic ostrich who kicks him into the sea,  an \\"enormous goldfish,\\" a safe refuge in a large cup, a \\"gigantic lobster,\\" and a sea turtle who rescues him. Finally, he discovers a giant newspaper upon which he flies back home.  He asks the kids \\"Now what do you think of that?\\"  On the last page, they hug him and shout: \\"COULD BE WORSE!\\"  By the way, on the next page, young hands had written in pencil \\"it could.\\"<br /><br /> What's interesting here is how Stevenson's tone makes this all sound like it really happened, even though a dream is strongly implied.  The vivid pictures (these are among Stevenson's best, he mixes rich pictures with other illustrations that display his more typical minimalist style), the detail, and the fun impossibility of it all make the reader \\"suspend\\" his or her incredulity.  If you read enough of these books, these characters takes on a familiarity and warmth that make them seem like old friends.<br /><br />One other great Stevenson touch:  The \\"dream\\" is populated by beings and items seen as Grandpa eats breakfast and begins his story: His newspaper, orange marmalade, coffee cup-even the \\"giant something-or-other\\" resembles his dog, and the sea turtle resembles his toast.  Spotting these correlates is more fun and sophisticated then finding \\"Waldo,\\" and the smile on the family's faces (including the dog, of course) makes this both a fun and an endearing book. While one should never write in a book that one doesn't own, the writing I found suggested strongly that Stevenson (a renowned illustrator for the New Yorker, and the author of many excellent kids' books) had once again captivated his audience.

Snow's brightly colored drawings (except for the black and white picture on pp. 10-11)  show cutaways of the dog's inner workings, including a telescope (eyes), microphones (ears), and something resembling a washing machine/bank vault to represent the stomach. All of this is very funny and creative on first viewing.  He uses computer analogies to explain higher functions like memory:  \\"All dogs, even the boring ones, have some sort of brain...\\" \\"All the information that goes into the brain is compared with the information that is already there (called memories).\\" In the \\"stored information\\" section of the dog, the cutaway reveals a bulletin board with tacked-on pictures (\\"visual memory\\") and bottles containing a boot, a sausage, and a treat (\\"smell memory\\").  Several small internal dogs operate the various levers and gadgets that control the mechanical beast we know as a dog.  (This begs the question of what operates the inner dogs, but Snow lets that one go).<br /><br />Obviously, this imaginative book is strictly for fun, and Snow's illustrations, short answers (e.g., \\"what happens when the eyes pick up an image of another dog\\") and guides (e.g., General Maintenance\\") are humorous and sometimes even instructive.  However, the book's mechanistic approach is sometimes off-putting as well.  Snow sometimes refers to the dog as an \\"it,\\" and this construct is reinforced throughout the book. In one two-page section, a vet opens up a sick dog as if the latter were simply a bad engine (screwdrivers and drill parts surround the upside-down canine).  Neither the eyes of the vet nor of the dog are shown, and each lacks a basic humanity or \\"caninity,\\" respectively.  Snow opens up the laboratory-like feeling of the book by showing a dog playing, eating, chasing, and exploring around a house, but the basic social nature of the dog is ignored.  Other sections of the book just don't feel right. The text for the diagram (that's what the pictures feel like) of the dog viewing an apparently frightened \\"other\\" dog reads, \\"Do I know this dog? Yes. His name is Fang, and he is my friend.\\" The humor around dogs' independence is usually reserved for cats, and the food-centered nature of the dog is nothing new-even if the illustrations are creative.<br /><br />As clever as the concept, and as well drawn the execution (this book won the New York Times Book Review title for \\"Best Illustrated Children's Book), the book lacks a certain warmth; you get the feeling that Snow doesn't own a dog.  After the initial satisfaction at seeing the bright, creative schematics, the dense text and complex pictures become almost taxing.  Occasionally, Snow takes a break from this formula, and his page about how dogs and owners come to resemble each other (\\"A pretty pampered dog will make its owner feel ugly and inferior. Result-the owner will rush off to the beauty salon.\\") succeeds well, and is the only illustration showing dogs and humans enjoying each other.<br /><br />I think little kids will enjoy the pictures and older kids will enjoy the obvious nonsense of it all, but the book could have \\"strayed\\" a bit more from its basic premise.  One could also view this book as a satire on kids' last-minute grade school reports, but Snow didn't take this route.

Compared with the previous version (this one),\\" the 3rd edition includes more information on preparing reports and tables, and exporting data.  However, the basic format and organization is the same.<br /><br />This book is organized into 8 chapters, with six appendices, and an index.  The overall organization is clear-- one topic leads clearly to the next (contrast this with the overly concise \\"Getting Started with the SQL Procedure,\\" also by SAS).  The book clearly assumes no previous SAS knowledge, although covering operating systems (e.g., Windows, your local workstation or mainframe) is beyond the book's scope.  Previous experience with any data entry, data management, or programming will be very helpful, but is not essential.  Each chapter is organized into two-page topics (these range from 7 topics in the MACRO chapter to 20 in the overly long data entry chapter) with introductory paragraphs, examples that include a small data set, and programming related to the topic.  Programming language related to the new topic is shaded to distinguish it from material already covered or otherwise irrelevant.  Because of the mini-data sets for each topic, you don't have to keep returning to datasets presented at the beginning only (as you do with some introductory texts).  The reason for using the language, the data, the example, and the output are all there on the 2 facing pages; it's very easy to use.<br /><br />In 217 well-written pages, the book advances from the very introductory (e.g., every SAS line ends with a semicolon; think of columns as variables, and rows as observations) to techniques (e.g., the chapter on MACROS) and programming \\"tricks\\" useful to those with years of experience (the too-brief chapter on debugging programs, the section on the always difficult MERGE statement).  This is the challenge of an introductory book:  It needs to teach the basics, but not so basic that one can finish the entire book in a couple of hours.  Delwiche and Slaughter handle this task superbly. Chapter 1, for example, explains basic SAS concepts (the database, the data step, procedures, viewing and printing output), and a few pages on SAS for Windows.  (The authors occasionally refer to SAS for Windows (\\"PC SAS\\"); this is valuable for those who have this software but otherwise extraneous.) Still, after nearly 15 years of SAS experience, I turn to this book when I want a concise yet easily understood explanation of something I may have not used for awhile.  After mastering this book, I recommend that users follow it with the somewhat more advanced \\"SAS Programming for Researchers and Social Scientists\\" (Paul Spector) and/or \\"Cody's Data Cleaning Techniques (Ron Cody).<br /><br />Chapters are as follows (I've added a sample topic in parentheses after each chapter title):<br /><br />1. Getting Started Using SAS Software  (\\"The Two Parts of a SAS Program\\")<br /><br />2. Getting Your Data into the SAS System (\\"Reading Raw Data...\\")<br /><br />3. Working with Your Data  (\\"Subsetting Your Data\\")<br /><br />4. Sorting, Printing, and Summarizing Your Data  (\\"Summarizing Your Rata with PROC MEANS\\")<br /><br />5. Modifying and Combining SAS Data Sets  (Combining Data Sets Using a One-to-Many Match Merge\\")<br /><br />6. Writing Flexible Code with the SAS Macro Facility  (\\"Macro Concepts\\")<br /><br />7. Using Basic Statistical Procedures  (\\"Using PROC REG for Simple Regression Analysis\\")<br /><br />8. Debugging Your SAS Programs  (\\"DATA Step Produces Wrong Results but No Error Message\\")<br /><br />The book's main problem is Chapter 2. The lengthy material on inputting data will be irrelevant for most students, as datasets are often already prepared.  Still, because one may sometimes need to create a dataset, the chapter is useful. In addition, chapter 8, doesn't contain include enough on error detection and debugging programs, an extremely important SAS skill that helps one detect and distinguish programming and dataset errors. Also the Appendix on resources, \\"Where to Go from Here,\\" mentions SAS Institute published books only, although this is partly due to the paucity of well written SAS books by independent authors when the second edition came out in 1998 (compared with today). Overall, while this much-loved book is much loved by those who took their first SAS steps with it.  I recommend the new edition (3rd) edition; it has more topics and is more current, for only slightly more money.rams, an extremely important SAS skill that helps one detect and distinguish programming and dataset errors.

The book most appropriate for intermediate or advanced SQL (Structured Query Language) users; it is not an introduction, as implied by the title.  First, if I were \\"getting started\\" with SQL, I would want to know why I needed to learn it. With the important exception of the `Join' chapter (roughly equivalent to \\"Merge\\" in SAS), the book does not explain the SQL's advantages compared with other database managers-there is little context.<br /><br />Although published by the SAS Institute, the book offers few contrasting examples of SQL and SAS. Except on one page (\\"When to Use Joins and Subqueries,\\" page 56) from the `Join' chapter, the book does not directly compare SQL to SAS or any other statistical language or database manager.  Similarly, there are few examples showing how to use them together. Instead, there's a very dry, nuts-and-bolts list of SQL procedure terms and very brief programming examples.  Contrast this with the SAS Institute volume, \\"SAS Guide to the SQL Procedure\\" which directly compares non-SQL SAS and SQL procedures, and is written in a more conversational and interesting manner.<br /><br />Looking at SQL only, the book does not explain adequately the laundry list of described procedures. Why and when, for example, would I want to create an \\"empty table (one that has variables but no rows)?\\" At times, many alternatives for a single SQL task, but there is little guidance about which one is better under what conditions. The concise language results in a relatively short book, but the instructions and sample programs are often truncated and confusing.  In the following excerpt, for example, example, the language is terse, apparently contradictory, and refers to an \\"operator\\" that has not yet been explained:<br /><br />\\"ALL does not suppress duplicate rows. When you use ALL, PROC SQL does make a second pass of the data to eliminate duplicate rows after it performs the set operation. Thus, using ALL is more efficient than not using it.

If you haven't bought one of the single volume books, it's best to order the combined.  Instructors, however, may wish their students to learn without the temptation of the solutions book nearby.<br /><br />I've found, for example, that when I can't solve one of Cody's ingenious problems (which may be harder or easier than they first appear), I'll go for the answer book using some rationale like, 'well, of course i know the answer, i'm just not getting it right now,\\" or \\"i KNOW the answer, but i don't have time to work on this, so i'll just 'check' to see if I have the right idea.\\"  All this may be true, but it bypasses the kind of experience you need to really learn SAS, and you may wind up thinking you know more than you do.<br /><br />Cody himself states that the \\"solution is obvious once you see it\\" and \\"the learning potential of the book is lost.\\" He therefore \\"removed the temptation for students to flip to the back of the book.\\" (Come now, aren't we more disciplined than that?). A more pragmatic argument is that \\"teachers may...feel more comfortable in assigning problems without the solutions too close at hand.<br /><br />This single-volume book has some very challenging problems, probably most appropriate for the intermediate to intermediate-advanced SAS programmer. You can really discover what you know about SAS by trying your hand at these well-conceived problems; as most SAS users know, the best way to learn is by doing. The problems give you some experience  before you encounter potentially hoarier problems at work or home. (You may also wish to examine the shorter but ceaper \\"test\\" book by Robert Virgile.)<br /><br />The Workbook's four sections are \\"Data Step Programming,\\" \\"Procedures,\\" \\"SAS Programming Techniques,\\" and \\"Statistics Problems.\\" Each of these sections has several brief topics; for example, Data Step Programming includes combining data sets, using IF-THEN/ELSE and other logical operators, numerical functions, dates, arrays, and working with longitudinal data.

But Paloma (\\"Dove\\" in Spanish) is sad, because she has no one to play with, and she wishes she had a sister.  While a beach bird looks on curiously, she picks up a stick and starts drawing \\"another little girl, like her but with curly hair.\\" Then the magic begins!  A pile of rocks behind her takes on the shape of a huge boulder-made person (\\"Big Daddy Rock\\").<br /><br />In a stunning illustration, \\"Daddy\\" blows and blows until Paloma's drawing turns into a little girl (\\"Sandy\\"), the playmate she wanted!  However, there's a Cinderella time-catch. Big Daddy informs Paloma, \\"You can have your sister til the tide comes back.\\"  Yuyi Morales (a young award-winning artist, as noted above by Amazon) draws shiny-centered yellow swirls of wind against a background of rolls and curves in the now golden sand.  We can feel Amanda White's description of Paloma as \\"amazed and excited and amazed all over again.\\"  The two girls have lots of beach fun, playing in the sand, pretending they're pirates, running after seagulls, and tide-pooling.  Unfathomably, these adventures are not illustrated by the talented Morales.  I would have loved to see her draw pirates and tide pools.  A conflict between the girls and the (temporary) disappearance of Paloma's \\"sister\\" keep the interest flowing, but the story's initial imagination begins to flounder-especially when compared with Morales' varying perspectives and flair for design.  Even Morales seems constrained by the almost unvarying color schemes and limited settings.  There's a happy conclusion (only slightly related to the magic playmate) that just seems a bit forced and pasted on.<br /><br />The 29 pages show Morales' acrylic brushstrokes, giving them a textured, slightly three-dimensional effect.  Morales also plays with perspective, on pages 1-2, for example, you get a fuller view of the small waves lapping at the sand because she curves the seashore as if viewing it though a small fisheye lens.  For somewhat older kids, I would recommend highly \\"Harvesting Hope.\\"  This work is perhaps best for the picture book crowd because of the large, high interest pictures, and the fairly soothing story.ves the seashore as if viewing it though a small fisheye lens.

The Rainbow Fish has brightly colored scales, and some of them shine like silver.  In a design coup, the book shows the fish decorated with tiny metallic paper scales.  The \\"oooooo\\" factor is high.  Not only is the rainbow fish an attention getter, but author/illustrator Pfister's ocean backgrounds show an imaginative color range.<br /><br />Fish's problem is whether beauty or friendship is more important.  When the proud fish haughtily, angrily refuses a small blue fish's request for one of his scales, Rainbow gets a bad \\"rep,\\" and the other fish ignore him.  Rainbow Fish advances one level of maturity when he realizes the consequences:<br />\\"What good were the dazzling, shimmering scales with no one to admire them?\\"  He reaches a somewhat more advanced level when a huge octopus, eyes gleaming in a purple-shadowed cave advises him to \\"'give a glittering scale to each of the other fish. You will no longer be the most beautiful fish in the sea, but you will discover how to be happy.'\\"  And so it happened:  \\"the more he gave away, the more delighted he became.\\"<br /><br />I agree that Rainbow Fish's motivation isn't very altruistic, and that he also could have pointed out the non-shimmery qualities of the other fish. But this is a book for small toddlers, not a platform for budding Rand followers. Slightly older kids could be led into a discussion of defending Fish's solution or proposing alternatives, and the visual highlights might inspire some painting or drawing.  Pfister first published the award-winning book in Switzerland (\\"Der Regenbogenfisch\\"); the translation is by J. Alison James.	2004-12-23

Although we're waiting for an accident to happen-we can just tell that young Maria is somehow going to lose her mother's ring while helping her make tamales-we also are pretty certain thins are going to work out alright.  While this may take away a bit of suspense, this is a comforting book that promises a happy conclusion (delivered her by a surprise).<br /><br />The text is simple and flows well; Soto is an experienced writer. He incorporates traditional activities like food, the visiting of extended family, and gift exchanges.  I was a bit puzzled that no religious elements were included, not even as an incidental (e.g., the family is returning form church, a religious decorative element).  However, I was not familiar with illustrator Ed Martinez, and it is his warm, emotional pictures that make this a \\"holiday book.\\"  He has a varied painting style, one drawing of Maria in light with a high contrast background recalls Renaissance paintings; other pictures use a Rockwellian focus on emotional faces and tableau-like scenarios.  Production values are good, although Putnam might have published a larger book with thick, glossy paper, and a heavier cover.	2004-12-23

Humorous twists on the `I remembered this, but forgot this' motif lift this book above the ordinary. For example: \\"I didn't forget to feed the goldfish, he just didn't look hungry,\\" and, after a bath, \\"I didn't use soap, but I didn't forget to.  I just don't like to.\\"  His mother is alternately tired, frustrated, and amused, and the clever story ends on a warm note. This is a sweet and simple story that manages to cover many familiar situations with honesty and empathy for all involved. Watch for the little mouse friend on every page!	2004-12-23

During this opening sequence, Sam the Owl calls out \\"who wants to play,\\" but the misty blue-grey landscape reveals sleeping animals only.  Then, on pages 8-9, Sam sees the light-or rather-a light, the one on the tail of the very spirited Gus the Firefly!  Following Sam, firefly Gus illuminates the night sky with zigs and zags, and he begins to spell brightly lit words in the night sky.  Intoxicated by the power of words, Gus misdirects airplanes, advertises a \\"FREE SHOW\\" at the theater, changes \\"hot dogs\\" to \\"COLD dogs,\\" and performs other `bad tricks.' But what will happen when the understandably angry hotdog seller captures Gus?<br /><br />P. D. Eastman's enduring story is funny, exciting, and easy to read. The firefly's bright yellow words are dazzling, especially for small fry, and the story shows the power of words (for good and for bad) and the value of friendship.  A great find you may remember from years past, this is another fine volume in the \\"Beginners Book\\" series from Random House.	2004-12-23

For Sorel, who dedicates the book \\"To the New York City of my childhood,\\" it was apparently a time of visible class differences (symbolized by neighborhood bully Morty, middle class hero Leo, and drawings of the disdainful rich) and social turmoil (fervent activists lecture passersby near a building with huge NRA signs).  Leo is what the movies used to call \\"a good boy,\\" he diligently practices his violin, and he's grateful for opportunities big (he's filmed playing the violin for Fiorella LaGuardia!) and small (a 20-cent pie at the Automat).  Most importantly, the respectable Leo doesn't actually fight Morty, instead, he fantasizes revenge in daydreams reenacting scenes from his beloved Bogart, Robinson, Cagney, and Flynn adventure films.<br /><br />Sorel draws big screen style pictures of these daydreams, placing young Leo en scene with his movie idols.  Cagney shoots Bogart and Robinson as Leo handcuffs Morty; Errol Flynn gives a winning smile as he watches young Leo disarm \\"Senor Morty's\\" sword with a thrust--of his violin bow.  Sorel's pictures replicate the high contrast, angular language of these films. Leo is not himself violent (Bogart, the person, did not really murder anyone). and his daydreams are recognizable escapes into imagined glory.<br /><br />There's a rather old-fashioned resolution to this story as well.  It takes place in the exquisitely drawn movie theater, Loew's Paradise.  After watching the newsreel of Leo playing before the mayor, Morty's parents congratulate the young violinist:  \\"... [Morty's] mother told Leo's mother how much she wished she had a son who could play the violin.\\"  (Ouch!)  Morty, scowling, hands in pocket and hunched over, looks away. And though \\"Leo almost felt sorry for him,\\" his proud, upright posture doesn't look very sympathetic.  These are the mean streets of Depression-era NYC, and Sorel doesn't sugarcoat the times.  While this seemed a bit harsh and abrupt, it's probably also a more accurate portrayal of \\"conflict resolution\\" in Leo and Morty's New York.  Sorel could treated this with the modern, healthier, talk-it-over approach, but that wouldn't have fit this particular slice of the Big Apple.

Told in an extended flashback (though, once again, the very young Grandpa and Wainy both sport moustaches), this wild, silly, and exciting tall tale will delight most toddlers and young children.<br /><br />Grandpa how Wainey couldn't agree with anything, and--Rashoman-like--Wainey claims that Grandpa was the disagreeable one. The alternate versions are just part of the fun.  Their own, somewhat more stern parents similarly tell young Grandpa and Wainey to take a long walk, \\"and don't come back until you agree on something!\\"  Wainey, with his trademark \\"Nump\\" (this is very funny to read aloud) repeatedly disagrees with the most factual of young Grandpa's observations on their walk.  The stroll turns into a series of semi-perilous adventures, including a landslide (\\"rocks,\\" according to Wainey) from which they are saved by a talking purple armadillo. In a hilarious sequence, Grandpa \\"hushed hundreds of ducks and geese\\" so he can find the lost Wainey:<br /><br />\\"At last, I had it down to one `WAH\\"...but it wasn't Wainey. It was just a parrot imitating the ducks and the geese.\\"<br /><br />Of course, Wainey, has an entirely different version of the landslide and the armadillo, which is just as silly and unbelievable as Grandpa's version.  Things get a little scarier as they fall safely off a cliff into a giant cave--or the moth of an iguana (depending on whose version you read).  They get out of the situation either by Wainey's irritating crying or Grandpa's boring speech. They two brothers eventually wind up on top of a gigantic, hot and bubbling, cherry pie, and they finally agree on something\\" They want to go home!  As in \\"We Hate Rain,\\" it all ends happily in the present with the kids, Grandpa, and Wainey enjoying some ice cream.<br /><br />Stevenson's signature style graces the entire book. The alternating but equally outlandish stories are captivating and very funny, and Stevenson's whimsy shows in his casual illustrations. (Yet, it's mostly presented n a straight, manner-of-fact style, without the exclamatory emphases of someone like the talented, but differently attuned, Dave Pilkey.)

When I read Chris Van Dusen's other book in this series \\"Down to the Sea with Mr. Magee,\\" I was completely amazed.  His super-detailed work, vivid gouache colors, and multiple perspectives just jumped off the page. There was a 50's retro style and setting, and a magical realism that recalls the best of Pixar animation. Much of that is evident in the sequel, \\"A Camping Spree with Mr. Magee,\\" including the super-realism, and the bold colors and perspectives, but it doesn't quite match up with the first book.<br /><br />I think that Van Dusen's visuals work  especially well when he's illustrating light, water, and  various shades of blue; the ocean surfaces of `Down to the Sea..' offers more of these visuals than the mountain setting here. However,  when we see a glimpse of the ocean, or the metallic/rubber looking Rambler (yes, it really looks like a combination of  a 1950's toy with some kind of hard rubber coating!) in which he and his dog Dee drive up to the mountains, that astonishingly fresh retro-style triumphs.  However, there are fewer of these views here, and Magee does not linger long enough before the trip for us to view van Dusen's 1950's-inspired depictions of their home and quaint village.<br /><br />Still, Van Dusen is one of the most original illustrator/writes working these days, and it's a treat to find this second \\"Magee\\" tale.  While I was somewhat spoiled by the magical pictures in the first book, this one probably has a more exciting story, and there are enough Dusen-style pictures to keep you riveted.  This is a fun all-rhyming story that quickly engages the reader. A comically drawn big black bear unhitches their trailer (inside of which Magee and dog are sleeping inside it) while going after a bag of marshmallows:  The excitement begins as the trailer \\"flew down the road in a wild, bumpy ride, with DEE and MAGEE sleeping soundly inside.\\"  They're heading for a waterfall, but fortunately, \\"their camper got stuck on a rock at the ledge.\\"  You may notice (in this and other scenes) how superbly van Dusen captures the colors of the river, and adds excitement by using different vantage points.<br /><br />Of course, the bear inadvertently rescues them, and there's a home sweet home last page.  Definitely worth your time, although I would give the edge to \\"Down to the Sea with Mr. Magee.\\"  Let's hope we see a lot more from this very enjoyable and original talent.You may notice (in this and other scenes) how superbly van Dusen captures the colors of the river, and adds excitement by using different vantage points.   <br /> <br />Of course, the bear inadvertently rescues them, and there's a home sweet home last page.

Awdry), and \\"In the Night Kitchen\\" (Maurice Sendak)!<br /><br />Note that Random House asked that readers name their most \\"memorable\\" books of the century, and most participants were probably adults. As seen in these reviews, \\"memorable\\" is not necessarily favorable. It appears from the diversity and intensity of feelings here that, depending on adult and child values, personalities, and sensibilities, reading this book can be a springboard for discussion or an incubator for nightmares.<br /><br />I'm always impressed with the number of excellent children's books available. If you think that the book may upset you or your small ones, or if it offends you or your values, then do not buy it. I will try to list some of the objections that reviewers have mentioned. The book shows little duck \\"Ping\\" almost being struck, his later escape and separation, birds yoked about the neck (Fishers yoke the birds so that they can't swallow the fish that they retrieve for the \\"Master\\"), Ping tricked, caught, and almost becoming dinner, and, finally, actually getting hit by a long stick. For some, it's like a kid's version of El Greco's war series. In the tradition of \\"Hansel and Gretel,\\" there is horror aplenty here, and there's no ultimate escape to freedom. I can also respect those who object to the stereotypes of the Chinese and China (the boy who captures and subsequently releases Ping is as brightly yellow as the duck, and the Yangtze River is colored yellow).<br /><br />Marjorie Flack wrote this and many other very popular books, and the book--written during the Depression and the sociopolitical movements of the 1930's--has historical interest. For example, one could argue that the book supports--or indicts--Fascism, Communism, Capitalism, or Social Darwinism. However, in a brief search on Google.com, I did not see any scholarly works about the book. Obviously, these are the concerns of adults and mature young teens.<br /><br />There is the potential, at least, that this book will be disturbing. So, please be aware of the controversial content and the differing reactions that your young audience could have. If you get the book, talk it over with them, as several people here have suggested. On another note, there's a lot to admire in the pictures. Kurt Wiese's simple but evocative color drawings are beguiling.

He is everywhere present: in his winking asides, his revolving idealist/cynical stance, and in his time-leaping comparisons of contemporary times with those of the founders. Vidal's sometimes quirky writing style includes unfinished rhetorical questions, an apparent disdain for textbook grammar, references to Shakespeare and the classicists (often in Latin), circuitously long sentences, and a tone alternating between scholarly report, detached bemusement, and profound concern (sometimes combining them into an inventive and provocative alloy).<br /><br />Citing Benjamin Franklin's written opinion (delivered by a friend to the Constitutional Convention) that our form of government will \\"eventually end in Despotism as other Forms have done before it, when the People become so corrupted as to need Despotic Government, being incapable of any other,\\"  Vidal shifts immediately to a  1996 Franklin biography, \\"[with] significantly-inevitably?, Franklin's somber predictions cut out, thus silencing our only ancestral voice to predict Enron et seq., not to mention November 2000, and following that, despotism whose traditional activity, war, now hedges us all around.\\"<br /><br />All of this will madden those who either disagree with his political views or who expect a traditional historical treatment.  Although Vidal obviously knows American history, the book is fundamentally an auteur's extended op-ed page or stage piece. Vidal's portrayals are a synthesis of his vast knowledge, prodigious research, hindsight perspective, and refreshingly unafraid opinion, mixing fact with both conjecture and psychological insight.  Once you accept this (or put the book down in disgust), you can enjoy Vidor's writing as you would a letter from an affectionate but outspoken family member: One who rules over discussions with a mix of fact and fancy, who educates, persuades, and regales his audience (including himself).<br /><br />Vidal covers the intriguing and monumental years from the pre-revolutionary era through the tumultuous presidencies of Washington and Adams (and, especially, contemporaries Hamilton and Madison), ending with a too brief discussion of Justice John Marshall and the roots of judicial review. After this always fascinating and sometimes frustrating view of the nation's founding, he provides an entertaining afterwards (as if he were finally free to really inject himself into the book) which includes a powerful anecdote about John F. Kennedy that poignantly conveys Vidal's anguish over the country he believes we have left behind.fact and fancy, who educates, persuades, and regales his audience (including himself). <br /> <br />Vidal covers the intriguing and monumental years from the pre-revolutionary era through the tumultuous presidencies of Washington and Adams (and, especially, contemporaries Hamilton and Madison), ending with a too brief discussion of Justice John Marshall and the roots of judicial review.

This is a beautifully illustrated story of \\"Jiro-San,\\" the supposedly \\"strange\\" older man who sweeps the beach, listens to birds, and waits mysteriously for something from the sea. Taro thinks Jiro-San is \\"old and wise,\\" but his sister Yuko considers him \\"weird.\\"  Jiro-san enlists the boy's help in sweeping the beach, and, for a moment, he wonders whether Taro was right about the \\"old\\" man. However, Jiro-San explains that his sea friends won't swim to this beach if they could get hurt on the scattered garbage.<br /><br />Taro and Jiro-San explore the inner bay, and in a series of striking tonal illustrations (one is mostly purples, another blues, and yet rich with another browns and yellows), the two see many wonders: Dolphins, swordfish, and a whale.<br /><br />\\"'Are they your old friends?' Taro asked.\\"<br /><br />\\"`They're friends,' said Jiro-San, `but not the old friends I meant. Maybe they will come tomorrow.'\\"<br /><br />Finally, Yuko joins the man and Taro, and they see an approaching shape: \\"It was huge and bobbed up and down on the water like an enormous cork. At last, the children could see what it was-a turtle!\\"  The next few pages show the huge turtle laying her eggs; eight weeks later, hundreds hatch from under the sand and crawl towards the beach. Yuko finally agrees with her brother that this is a wise man indeed-\\"full of wonderful secrets.\\"  A one-page afterward (\\"About Sea Turtles\\") explains the breeding of young loggerhead turtles, and the need for protecting them.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed the book very much, especially Nilesh Mistry's vivid and imaginative pictures, I felt just a little disappointed at its conclusion.  Both the last picture (the turtles scurrying to the sea in an almost abstract pattern) and the text (the realization that Jiro-San is wise, not \\"crazy\\") seem slightly anticlimactic, especially after the preceding excitement.

Books	5	10	10	N	N	Rainy Day Tale	When Mary Ann and Louie complain to their grandfather about two straight days of rain, he remembers when he and his younger brother \\"Wainey\\" experienced a real rainstorm. Told in an extended flashback, his straight-on delivery of one of the wildest and silliest rainstorms is sure to delight toddlers and young children.<br /><br />Grandpa recounts a turn of the century rainstorm in which it rained so hard that the water eventually started filling their Victorian house (beautifully illustrated by Stevenson). Grandpa and Wainey's parents are as unperturbed as Grandpa is in telling the story to his grandchildren. Young Wainey inexplicably (and to much laughter from our son) says \\"Yump\\" a lot. As the water rises from the floor to the ceiling to the second floor and beyond, the two boys take advantage of their watery circumstances.  Taking a bath is no problem, of course, nor are diving contests in the half-submerged rooms, sending letters by boat, nor visiting neighbors who float in and out of the house while calming seated.  They're an unflappable bunch.<br /><br />However, when prehistoric-looking fish swim by, and the family is forced to the roof with one cracker left to eat, young Grandpa dives to the bathroom and pulls the plug on the inundated house. Back to the present, the rain stops, \\"Uncle Wainey\\" comes over, and the whole family enjoys some strawberry ice cream.  Stevenson's signature style graces the entire book. The combination of the increasingly outlandish content with the Grandfather's flat delivery works well, and Stevenson's whimsy shows in the complementary illustrations, lettering, and throwaway humor: There's just enough plausibility in this improbable tale that you can immerse yourself in it.  Highly recommended!	2004-12-10

When your eyes feast upon the frontispiece illustrations-before the story has even begun-you know you're into something good. Eric Velasquez serves up a sometimes dazzling, sometimes quiet, evocation of the magic of album covers, salsa music, and warm family love in this autobiographical reminiscence of his childhood in Spanish Harlem.<br /><br />The pictures can be eye-popping dazzling; many times they are more serene one-panel set pieces.  At all times, they accurately and richly convey emotion and setting.  Here, the settings range from Grandma's house in El Barrio, to a brightly lit nightclub (both inside and out) in the Bronx, and even to young Eric's imagination.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Eric and his grandmother, who met many of the best salsa players while growing up in Puerto Rico.  The furnishings and her love of a few material objects suggest her relatively modest means:  her record player and records.  Without a trace of melodrama or contrivance, author/illustrator Velasquez shows music's importance to \\"Grandma\\":<br /><br />\\"Sometimes,\\" Grandma said, \\"a song can say everything that is in your heart as if it was written just for you.\\"<br /><br />She says this, covering her heart, and at the side, we see a picture of her and her husband long ago in Puerto Rico. There is joy as well. Listening to a meringue from the Dominican Republic, Grandma sways her hips, moves her arms, and generally loses herself in the rhythms.  There's one shockingly good picture showing a somewhat older Eric drawing sketches based on album covers: \\"As I drew, I could see the record covers coming to life and the bands performing right there in Grandma's living room.\\"  Bright, angular, Picasso-like suggestions of musicians playing their instruments fill the page.<br /><br />The narrative turns on an invitation from Grandma's band member friends (Rafael Cortijo \\"to bomba y plena what Duke Ellington was to jazz,\\" Ishmael Rivera, and Sammy Ayala) to hear them at a nightclub. Grandma and Eric wear their best clothes, walk into the darkened theater, and begin to hear a conga beat \\"BOOM BAK BOOM BAK BOOM BAK.  Then the lights came on with a loud BOOM, and the band began to play the song \\"El Bombom de Elena\\" (\\"Elena's Candy\\").\\"  Eric and his Grandmother share a strong love for each other, bound, in part, by the riches of their shared music. \\"Even today,\\" writes Velasquez, \\"I imagine I'm back in Grandma's living room and she turns to me and says, \\"You be the DJ today. Siempre me gusta tu selecci&oacute;n.\\"  (\\"I always like your selection.\\")<br /><br />First published in 1991, this is one of the best books for kids and adults I've read this year.

(It was light blue).\\"<br /><br />\\"'May I show you the new Tooth-Gnasher Superflash? We only have one left.'\\"<br /><br />\\"'Is it the light-blue one?' Mrs. Popsnorkle asked.\\"<br /><br />That interchange may go right past some little ones' heads, but like the best kids' humor, it can be appreciated at many levels (think \\"Bullwinkle\\").  As mentioned above, when Popsnorkle takes the wheel and starts pressing buttons, the Tooth Gnasher Superflash transforms itself into a series of impossible (and sometimes extinct) animals.  The exuberance of the Popsnorkles combined with the increasingly fearful face of the salesman in the back seat create a farcical scene made even more spectacular by the Superflash's many forms (though it always remains a nice light blue, even when it looks like a big elephant).<br /><br />The very perplexed salesman takes \\"lots of money,\\" and the Popsnorkles drive off in the Tooth-Gnasher.  The last paragraph does not disappoint, as Pinkwater manages to inject yet another surprise in this creative, silly, and fun book.  Highly recommended for almost anyone that can appreciate the Pinkwaterian style; this book may very well make a fan out of you!  As there are several books by Daniel Pinkwater (some of the later ones beautifully, whimsically illustrated by his spouse, Jill Pinkwater), you'll be in for a treat.s there are several books by Daniel Pinkwater (some of the later ones beautifully, whimsically illustrated by his spouse, Jill Pinkwater), you'll be in for a treat. <br />	2004-12-01

Loudly illustrated by Kenneth Spengler's gouache portrayals of New York City touched by young Billy's Western imagings, the book weaves a tricky path between pure entertainment and message.  For the most part, it succeeds.<br /><br />Billy sees a broken truck with vehicles waiting behind it as a wagon train needing repair.  Spengler draws a big truck, but he cleverly winds the street and vehicles around in a semicircle to suggest Billy's embellishment of the scene. Similarly, the urban hot dog vendor is at once a NYC vendor and a chuck wagon man (implied simply by his handkerchief and scraggly face).  When Billy enters the \\"Badlands\\" by way of a shortcut through the \\"arroyo\\" he remembers a trick that his grandfather taught him to hide and then switch back to his destination: The post office.<br /><br />This kind of book is difficult to pull off, but the message of love, rememberance, and continuity may very well comfort younger children. The book is entertaining as well, but it seems that the potential for a truely wild \\"Western\\" experience was moderated somewhat by framing the story within Billy's relationship with his grandfather.  Therefore, the story feels a bit restrained, despite the vivid pictures and \\"cast.\\"  However, the author explicitly states (in an endnote) that sheer entertainment was not her goal here; instead, she wrote the book to comfort and to evoke the power of imagination.	2004-12-01

While there is a great deal of useful information, the book awkwardly combines the simple and the advanced.  For example, chapters 1 and 6 explain automatically generated error messages in SAS logfiles.  A great many of these errors are either self-explanatory, unnecessary to understand in the detail presented here, or may not be included in your own program logs.  Still, it is very helpful to have these listed and explained in a compact form.<br /><br />The value of three other chapters will also depend on the experience of the user and the type of software used.  One very long chapter is devoted to debugging errors in macros; if you don't use macros, these chapters are of limited use.  Another chapter,  \\"Debugging SAS DATA Steps with the DATA Step Debugger,\\" is apparently only for SAS for Windows software. Furthermore, the correct programming is superimposed on very small pictures resembling Windows screens; it is frustrating to read the resulting tiny font size.<br /><br />Chapter 3, \\"Debugging SAS Language Programs,\\" is the most helpful one for the intermediate level user.  One of the difficulties in SAS and other languages is that a program may run and produce output, but contain undetected errors.  Burlew explains a variety of clever options statements and SAS language statements that improve your ability to detect logical, syntactic, and semantic errors.  Another nice feature is an Appendix that describes how to build the data sets that are used as exemplars throughout the book.<br /><br />Chapters are as follows:<br /><br />1 .Understanding the Types of Errors in SAS Programs, p.  24<br />2. Reading the SAS Log and Interpreting SAS Messages, p.  29<br />3. Debugging SAS Language Programs,  p.  45<br />4. Debugging SAS DATA Steps with the DATA Step Debugger, p. 109<br />5.

The book is as entertaining as it is intelligent, neither simplifying nor mystifying a complex emotional issue.  Moreover, the tone is just right: Instead of a preachy or saccharin approach, the story is suffused with a genuine warmth.<br /><br />The book opens with the Soto family planting a magnolia tree, dubbed \\"Maggie\\" by their only child, Julia. The beautifully colored tree provides shade, indoor flowers, and a place to just hang out. The family and the neighbors love Maggie. In fact, the Sotos love the tree so much that they decide to add a fig tree  (in one of several humorous grace notes, they name it \\"Figaro\\").  In a parallel story, Mrs. Soto is expecting the son who will be Julia's first sibling.  Maggie begins to voice the concerns that Julia might be having: \\"The magnolia...had mixed feelings.  `Nobody asked me if I wanted another tree...'\\"  When Figaro is planted, Maggie feels forgotten and trampled upon (literally).  Maggie resents the newcomer, \\"When's he going back to where he came from, I wonder. Things were better before...\\"<br /><br />Over time, Maggie resolves her anger as she tries out the new roles of protector and provider.  Yet, she doesn't sacrifice her own identity, and neither does Julia with her new brother, Felix.  Over time, Maggie learns to truly enjoy Figaro.  As illustrated in soft watercolors by Iorio, Maggie is amused at Figaro's knotted muscles, fading yellow leaves, and luscious purple figs.  As Julia and Felix grow up (Sera and Ioria easily communicate the passage of time), Maggie and Figaro have become the best of friends, and Maggie sees how Figaro \\"made all the good times better,\\" and that \\"it's a wonderful thing to have a brother tree in the yard.\\"<br /><br />This exceptionally wise book pursues difficult issues through the trees' perspective: The relationship between Julia and Felix is implied only.  This approach may encourage your child to feel more comfortable talking about his or her \\"negative\\" feelings.  The book is very attractive, with lots of white space around both the text and the soft, welcoming pictures.  Publisher Vocalis printed this on that wonderfully thick, smooth and glossy paper that only kids' books seem to have.  \\"Another Tree in the Yard\\" is directly concerned with the potential problems of a new  brother or sister, but it really covers the challenges and rewards that accompany any change.  It's one of the best new books for families this year.through the trees' perspective: The relationship between Julia and Felix is implied only.

Spruce and his three best friends-Bascom the beaver, Sedgewick the squirrel (or is it a woodchuck?), and Linwood the skunk-live in the fields and swamps surrounding \\"Moosemelookalike Lake.\\" There's a wonderful map of the area a la \\"Wind in the Willows,\\" although there are no references to the colorful place names in the text.<br /><br />Spruce is a big moose with very big antlers.  They keep growing each year until mid-winter. This year, however, Spruce's antlers are staying put. In a series of light mishaps, he gets stuck in doorways, knocks over clothes lines and birdhouses, and is unable to grab a present that he made for Bascom's birthday. Spruce's friends show real friendship and understanding, and they eventually help him loosen his antlers.<br /><br />The warmth of the story is accompanied by Stapler's [pictures of Spruce's cozy forest cottage.  It's filled with antique pottery and dishes, old snowshoes, and crafts.  An old milk pail, oak barrel, and braided rugs lay upon a wood-planked floor. Outside, a pile of split lumber and a snowman decorate the frosted tree landscape of frosted trees. With friends gathered around, and Spruce wearing a green and red sweater, the book speaks of \\"the Christmas season\\" (but in a secular sense only). Recommended!	2004-11-13

Valens' Stylish illustrations are the highlight here; the bright patterns framing each drawing look like old painted clay tiles. She mixes unusual, festive shades of blues, greens, orange, purple, and other colors for a \\"Mediterranean\\" look.<br /><br />The story concerns Danilo, a Sicilian fruit peddler. On the way home, he accidentally discovers a hidden park with trees bearing magical purple, pink, and blue fruits.  In a somewhat abrupt transition, Danilo meets a mysterious man who shares the delicious fruit with him.  But the man also has a parable in the form of a poem, which warns Danilo that he must give the fruit away, without thought of profit or planting a new crop. Used to his commercial ways, Danilo somehow doesn't get the message, and when he tries to sell the magical fruit, it turns into rocks. Months later, when he no longer needs the magical fruit or even thinks about selling it, he is inclined to just give the remaining ones away. In another surprisingly abrupt transition, a magical tree appears.  Now, when he no longer needs the fruit in a moneymaking sense, he can find them.<br /><br />The plot is a bit contrived, and sometimes characters and \\"surprise\\" elements seem somewhat pasted into the story, rather than developing naturally out of it. Still, in the tradition of many folk stories, the book has a lilting tone, and it concludes with an especially gentle moral about sharing freely. The vivid, Sicily-inspired decorative motifs, and the insertion of Italian words add to its simple appeal.	2004-11-12

Nancy Van Laan, author of the defiantly slangy \\"Possum Comes a Knockin,'\\" once again shows her keen sense of sound in this very fun picture book for infants and toddlers. It's a simple story that, in someone else's hands, could have seemed formulaic and predictable.  Van Laan, however, turns this into a frolicking poem that begs for dramatic oral expression.  You're the conductor here-speed up and slow down your voice, turn the volume up and down, register surprise, disappointment, and delight, as you read this out loud.  Sheila White Samton's unique collage-style pictures will also captivate your audience.<br /><br />The simple story tells of a (briefly seen) boy and his dog looking for a certain tree.  Instead, they find trees inhabited by friendly looking animals including frogs, possums (!), grasshoppers, worms, and squirrels.  SPOILER:  Our heroes eventually find the cozy tree house they were searching for!Nicely produced by Borzoi Books for Knopf, \\"A Tree for Me\\" has 28 beautifully illustrated pages.  Although a few of the words are difficult (e.g., squirrels, dangling), the repeating words in Van Laan's poem may make this an appropriate book for the beginning reader as well as the small fry hearing it from you.	2004-11-12

Here, we meet Hubie the mouse and his family, featured in earlier Stevenson books such as \\"The Seaview Hotel,\\" and \\"The Stowaway.\\"<br /><br />In faux documentary style, the first page announces that it's 1937 (look at the upper left, or you might not see this).  Hubie and his family visit a grand, rococo-style movie theatre to see  the melodramatic \\"The Island of No Return\\" (scenes from which Stevenson draws in evocative shades of gray).  Hubie  alternately displays and hides his fears--especially of islands. As the youngest family member, and the only one who is afraid, Hubie is somewhat of a castaway in his own family.<br /><br />Stevenson then tosses in one of many improbable but fun plot twists:  The family receives a large, stylish \\"Greetings from Barabooda Island\\" foldout from their aunt.  They fly there in a dirigible (just another in Stevenson's bag of scene-setting tricks), but Hubie very accidentally falls out and lands in the giant mouth of a pelican swimming a few hundred feet below.  \\"I beg your pardon...,\\" Hubie says very properly,\\" I just fell out of a dirigible.\\"  In what now seems like a parody of \\"Survivor,\\" Hubie meets a castaway on a deserted (or is it?) island, who shows him his baseball stadium, drum set, fruit stand, and speedboat!<br /><br />Everything is done in a wonderfully offhand style, with more and more fantastic perils facing our heroes on the island.  Stevenson's casual drawings and very handwritten-looking text add to the whole tone of sublime nonsense.  There's also a nicely done light message at the conclusion, as Hubie's adventures feed a newly discovered appetite for adventure.<br /><br />Stevenson is beloved by many adults and kids; still,  it seems that this superb writer has not received his due recognition.  This book is an excellent introduction to his talents, and I hope it will encourage  you to read his many other books. The book is 30 pages long, with illustrations done in pen and ink and watercolor, and the usual high production standards of the Greenwillow publishing house.age  you to read his many other books.

Janice Levy and Chris Monroe's \\"Totally Uncool\\" doesn't tell what happened to the unnamed girl's mother, but this makes the ambiguous situation even more widely applicable. The girl, who looks around 6 or 7 years old, objects to Daddy's newest girlfriend--the one he calls \\"Sweet Potato.\\"  She keeps looking for something to criticize, even relatively minor differences:  \\"She doesn't play soccer. Or work out in a gym. Video games? She hasn't a clue.\\"  Then there are the slight idiosyncrasies that accompany almost any person: \\"She plays the tuba\\"....\\"Falls asleep sitting up\\"....\\"Her hair is porcupine\\"...\\"She sings opera to her goldfish.\\" These observations supply much of the book's gentle humor.<br /><br />Midway through the book, the girl begins to recognize and accept Sweet Potato's kind ways and understanding nature:  \\"She listens to me without the TV on. Keeps my secrets secret...\\" \\"Lets me slam doors when things aren't fair.  She never calls me stupid.\\" \\"She doesn't yell when I forget things. Or drop things. Well, maybe just a little.\\"  On the last page, the daughter humanizes her by telling us her real name (\\"Elizabeth\\") and, smiling, concedes \\"Maybe there's hope for her yet.\\"<br /><br />The book shows and normalizes the difficulties inherent in such situations. Kids may see that their resentful feelings are natural, but that they can be balanced by the new adult's (sometimes overlooked) good qualities.  The new adult can see the situation from the child's view, and may get some perspective on respecting each other's boundaries and providing emotional support. But \\"Totally Uncool\\" is not just for family situations such as this one.  It shows that it's not always easy to build a friendship, and that one must try to balance the newcomer's seemingly  \\"uncool\\" surface characteristics with an appreciation of that person's deeper, more fundamental nature.  Monroe's informal, \\"crayonish\\" illustrations keep thing light and underscore the narrative child-centered perspective.  This is an excellent book that skillfully and lightly explores the evolving adjustment to the family newcomer.informal, \\"crayonish\\" illustrations keep thing light and underscore the narrative child-centered perspective.

In fact, the dog is emulating some of the most common and enjoyable human activities (going to movies, coffee houses, etc.). There's even a precedent for this emulation:  In Daniel Pinkwater's excellent \\"Bongo Larry,\\"  Larry the Polar Bear plays bongos and reads poetry in a beat-like coffee joint. These are not \\"slackers,\\" they are the compadres of Ginsberg, Kerouac, Ferlinghetti, et al.<br /><br />However, I must also agree with the reviewer who objected to the book's language. While I'm usually reluctant to criticize slang or \\"bathroom humor (see Dave Pilkey's \\"Captain Underpants\\" for an excellent example of the latter), the repeated use of the word \\"dumb\\" shows an intolerant, insensitive human father.  The same point (that the father thinks the dog can't follow directions, but the son knows that it's a con job to get out of obeying the rules) could have been made in a different way.  For example, Milgrim could have shown frustration or anger or resentment without the name-calling.  In this 29-page book, the word \\"dumb\\" is used three times in the first 5 double-paged scenes.  The tone is all wrong for a light-hearted book like this, especially when the dad calmly says \\"wow, what an idiot.\\" He says this while observing the dog running (on two legs!) with a net after a butterfly--a pretty skilled activity for man or beast.  Then, in the book's \\"message,\\" the boy says he's not fooled by Sneakers' duplicity: \\"I know a genius when I see one.\\" This does not make up for the scornful tone in the preceding 28 pages; it rings false, as if Milgrim concluded with some \\"warmth\\" to make the book more appealing.<br /><br />There are many good unconventional children's books available: Books that break the rules, both through illustration and theme. Milgrim's overblown black ink and gouache pictures, with their explosive colors and informal written dialogue, are very good. However, there are many imaginative, non-traditional authors and illustrators who adopt a more appropriate and consistent tone when dealing with nonconformity, defiance, or misbehaving (e.g., almost anything by Pinkwater, Rosemary Well's \\"Max and Ruby\\" series, Dav Pilkey's \\"Captain Underpants,\\" Roddy Doyle's \\"The Giggler Treatment,\\" Nicole Rubel's \\"Rotten Ralph\\").ever, there are many imaginative, non-traditional authors and illustrators who adopt a more appropriate and consistent tone when dealing with nonconformity, defiance, or misbehaving (e.g., almost anything by Pinkwater, Rosemary Well's \\"Max and Ruby\\" series, Dav Pilkey's \\"Captain Underpants,\\" Roddy Doyle's \\"The Giggler Treatment,\\" Nicole Rubel's \\"Rotten Ralph\\").	2004-10-29

It's not necessary to have a retriever type dog to enjoy this book, but it definitely helps.  Ted Rand's pictures capture their essence, and our family delighted in the similarities with our Golden Retriever, Sadie the Wonder Dog.  Michael J. Rosen's (\\"We're Going on a Bear Hunt,\\" and numerous other books) narrative is simple but engagingly creative, he compares the (unnamed) boy's Golden to various animals as the dog plays. For example, Rosen writes that the dog is \\"a Billy goat when he chews the mail,\\" and the two-page illustration shows both the dog and a Billy goat demolishing envelopes. Similarly, the retriever is like \\"a Hibernating Bear when he naps beside me in bed,\\" and Rand `s grease pencil and watercolor illustration depicts a big brown bear sleeping in a cave beneath the snow. Other apt comparisons include a mole, a beaver, a crocodile, a pony, a seal (\\"when he's slick with soap from a sudsy shampoo\\"), a kangaroo, a lion, a cow, and a groundhog!  The only animal that I thought should be included was a gazelle, but maybe it's only Sadie who leaps and bounds over vegetation to retrieve a tennis ball.  The book concludes with the simple, yet somewhat poignant, \\"And so, with a dog like that, a kid more me...can be anything I truly want to be.\\" The book's underlying premise is beautifully realized by Rosen and illustrator Rand.	2004-10-25

The monkeys frolic through the Brazilian rainforest, swinging from vine to vine, and, most importantly, climbing the thorny tall trees:<br /><br />Still they climb, UP-UP!<br />And they slide, Down-Down!<br />They sing, \\"Jibba-jibba-jabba.\\"<br />swinging round and round<br /><br />JUMP, JABBA JABBA,<br />RUN, JABBA JABBA,<br />SLIDE, JABBA JABBA,<br />Tiny monkeys having fun!<br /><br />But these same trees keep them from having a comfortable home, unlike their neighbors the armadillo and the toucan. The monkeys SAY they're going to build a house, but fun and delicious things (e.g., bananas!) keep them from doing it!<br /><br />The short rhymes and wonderful animal and nature sounds make this a very fun book to read out loud. The rhythms are musical, and the capitalized sounds (e.g., PLINKA PLINKA, WOOYA WOOYA, GURR-YUH GURR-YUH) are your cue to turn up the narrative volume for your little one. They'll eat it up. Slightly older toddlers may also enjoy the monkeys' priorities of fun and food over practicality. Yumi Heo has an unusual palette: I love the blues in her bubbling river and stormy sky. Her repetition of the playing monkeys nicely complements the repeated sounds of the text, and her flat, \\"folkish\\" drawings, filled with repeated designs and iconic imagery, evoke the teeming rainforest. The book was included in \\"The 3rd Edition of The New York Times Parent's Guide to the Best Books for Children.\\" A simple but superb performance by van Laan and Heo.	2004-10-25

This nicely illustrated musical history explains how the \\"psychedelic\\" sound of mid- to late- 60's San Francisco bands (e.g., the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Janis Joplin, Country Joe and the Fish, Moby Grape, and others) were an extension of folk music with roots in 1950's beat culture. Thus, Kesey, Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burrows figure prominently in the book, giving the music its foundation, it's apolitical ethos, and (as Hoskyns repeatedly emphasize)  its  acid and other  drugs.  The author's most fascinating and best writing occurs when he explores the roots and evolution of the San Francisco sound, and its love/hate relationship with the subcultures in which it was embedded..  For example, his analysis of the tension between the Berkeley radicals and the hippies is surprisingly astute and well documented (especially since there is inadequate analysis in much of  the book).<br /><br />The end  of the psychedelic scene  is a familiar and  shallow account that includes  legions of teen runaways, rampant  drugs and violence, and, (must we hear this again?) the conveniently  symbolic disaster at Altamount.  More instructive is his description of how the music industry co-opted the scene (with help from musicians who actually wanted to make money!), the organizational talent of  promoter Bill Graham who competed with the established but looser \\"Family  Dog\\" outfit, the overdoses, and the dissolution of the beat-inspired ethos.  Hoskyns  writes that  some of  this  was dissolution was inevitable, as the once young hippie musicians became the establishment, and a new generation rebelled against it.  However,  while San  Francisco was a major part of the 60's scene,  it was not the only part, and Hoskyns  doesn't  place it within the national context of the Nixon presidency, the increasing military/police complex, and the growing politicalization and militancy of women and other disenfranchised groups.<br /><br />More importantly,  for  a music history Hoskyns' musical analysis is fairly weak,  you don't get an idea of what the music was like, nor is there much discussion of how the groups differed.  But that would have required a more serious, even scholarly book.  \\"Beneath the Diamond Sky\\" is meant to appear a bit trippy, with different fonts and font SIZES and various tie-dye colors thrown in to replicate the feeling of the period. This mostly doesn't work;  it's too much artifice, but at least you get some feeling for the creative  impulse of the time.  Finally,  the book would have been better with  a epilogue tracing what more of what happened to the S.F. musical and cultural leaders after the 60's ended, and what their influence has been on others.<br /><br />However,  that's not really what this  book  is about (despite its  excellent early cultural analysis). The book is best for its great photographs of these seminal musicians and cultural icons in their prime, including pictures of street scenes, posters, and free concerts at Golden Gate park Still, the book  can be  annoying because of typos  and other mistakes, and seemingly contradictory statements.

Fortunate son Kevin Spoon has nearly everything, including his own TV, VCR, stereo, computer, professional running shoes, first baseman's glove, and even purebred guppies. One day, he encounters nonconformist Mason Mintz, who is deemed \\"weird.\\" He wears sloppy clothes, cheap sneakers, a plaid hat, and says \\"ho\\" instead of \\"hi\\" because he likes the way it sounds. But Mason has a unique toy-a doodle flute-that not even the toy-wealthy Kevin has seen.  The doodle flute plays a sound that Kevin had never heard before; furthermore, Mason's dad gave it to him, and it's the last of its kind.  The interaction between Kevin (who attempts to buy or trade for the doodle flute) and Mason (with his easy  individualism and Zen-like common sense) is graced by Pinkwater's characteristic dry humor and pithy dialogue.<br /><br />Although never preachy or saccharine, the book has some very important lessons.  Like Mr. Plumbean in Pinkwater's \\"The Big Orange Splot,\\" individuality has value. What may appear \\"weird\\" may really be an opportunity for growth, and the importance of sharing continues. Pinkwater also touches on how something unique and personal (the flute is given to Mason by his father) may have more value than the most expensive things.  Even without these wise (and subtle) messages, Pinkwater has written an engaging and unique book, complemented by his trademark casual colored marker illustrations. This is a small gem of a book in the inimitable Pinkwater style.	2004-10-25

This is the little book that spawned a multi-million dollar empire of Shrek toys, a Shrek shoe, Shrek Gameboy games, and, of course, the two wildly successful movies. So, how good is the book that spawned all these money makers?<br /><br />William Steig's Shrek is a malodorous, stink loving, ugly green monster-man: \\"'What a lovely stench!' Shrek cackled. The witch specialized in horrors, but one look at Shrek made her woozy.\\" Shrek is not quite as loveable as in the movie; he delights in his ability to disgust: He dreams that adoring children are playing with him, and deems it a nightmare. Steig's humor is playfully insidious, and there are several clever poems:<br /><br />\\"Your horny warts, your rosy wens,<br /><br />Like slimy boogs and fusty fens,<br /><br />thrill me.\\"<br /><br />The plot resembles the movie, but stripped down. There's a donkey (though he's not wildly verbal as in the movie), and a royal woman to rescue from a castle. However, the fights are all won either by his horrid personal traits or his ability to spit fire. After her rescue, and a vampire-like tryst (\\"Shrek snapped at her nose. She nipped at his ear. They clawed their way into each other's arms. Like fire and smoke, these two belonged together.\\") Shrek marries his soul mate: \\"And they lived horribly ever after, scaring the socks off all who who fell afoul of them.\\"<br /><br />The movie, with its million dollar voices, special effects, and expanded story line and satirical edge is better than the book, and I was never a huge fan of the movie. Please do not expect this short but original story to match the powerhouse film, or you will be disappointed. Additionally, Steig's strength is the humor and reversal of the usual fairy tale, the illustrations are only fair. Still, bigtime Shrek fans will want to take a look at the 1990 book that started an industry.	2004-10-25

We first read this book to our son when he was a toddler, now that he's ten, we still use it as a way to encourage his (and our) appreciation of others' choices. Pinkwater is one of the great storytellers and educator its around, and this book deserves as wide an audience as possible. It's that good. As usual, Pinkwater doesn't spend much time on developing a plausible plot: Things just happen, and, because of his dry matter-of-fact tone, you accept it. One day a seagull with a can of bright orange paint \\"dropped the can (no one knows why) right over Mr. Plumbean's house.\\" The resulting big orange splot upsets the neighbors, who all live in identical brown housed with gray roofs and green shutters. When they ask him to paint his house (to get rid of the orange splot), Plumbean follows the letter--but not the spirit=-of their request. He paints the house red, yellow, green, and purple. He adds more splots, strikes, and \\"elephants and lions and pretty girls and steam shovels.\\"<br /><br />The neighbors are aghast. In a recurring motif, the neighbors exclaim that something must be wrong with their neighbor: \\"Plumbean has gushed his mush, lost his marbles, and slipped his hawser.\\" Mr. Plumbean resists their pressure, explaining in one of many memorable lines from the book: \\"My house is me and I am it. My house...looks like all my dreams.\\" One by one, over tall glasses of lemonade, Mr. Plumbean casually talks to the other neighbors, one by one, about their own dreams.  The following day, each neighbor expresses those dreams through his or her house.<br /><br />The book isn't so much about nonconformity as about self-expression, or what Maslow called \\"self-actualization.\\" That everyone eventually paints their house in wild colors is not so much a new form of conformity, but rather the flowering and unafraid celebration of their individuality, and an acceptance of this in others. Very highly recommended; it may be a book you'll treasure for years to come.	2004-10-25

Mr. Webb, the patient teacher with the wavy feathers and yellow tennis shoes announces that its naptime--but Goldie doesn't want to sleep. All the other toddler animals are down on their naps: The bunny rabbit, the little lamb, and the cute pig with ribbons around her ears, but little bird Goldie would rather sail a boat, drag a train, or swing beneath the big tree. Besides, she announces repeatedly, \\"Naps are for babies.\\"<br /><br />When she does lie on her nap she immediately kicks the pig, then, in an inspired moment of rebellion, she whistles the class song. \\"Naps are for babies.\\" Finally, when naptime is long over, the beleaguered Mr. Webb (there's a wonderful picture of him looking like he's about to nod off) gives everyone some milk and cookies, and Goldie finally and naturally drifts off to sleep.<br /><br />Nicole Rubel's entertaining story frames the central issue of freedom versus control. How do you balance the child's individuality with societal demands, especially in competitive settings? Clearly, Mr. Webb favors the looser, child-centered approach. But does that lead to antisocial behavior (e.g., the kicking of the pig), and an egocentric non-adaptability?<br /><br />Return to review: Nicole Rubel's entertaining story is great fun to read aloud (e.g., the repeated \\"Naps are for babies\\") and has the rebellious humor captured in her famous \\"Rotten Ralph\\" series. It also shows the toddler what to expect in preschool, both the play and the routines of pre-school type settings. Rubel, as usual, illustrates with a certain motif; I pick up a Southwestern flavor here, (although I've been wrong about this in the past; personal communication with author). The illustrations are somewhat too cluttered for its audience; I had trouble picking out Goldie on several of the pages. In addition, the yellow colors seem a bit off; this may be the age of the book I was reading, Rubel's palette, or the production by publishers HarperCollins.<br /><br />Nicole Rubel's other books (the \\"Rotten Ralph\\" series, \\"Cyrano the Bear,\\" \\"A Cowboy Named Ernestine,\\" for example) show her enormous illustrative talents better than does \\"Goldie.\\" Rubel is a personal favorite; like other masters of kids' books, she has a great sense of humor and a very personal drawing style. These are books that please both adults and children.r />Nicole Rubel's other books (the \\"Rotten Ralph\\" series, \\"Cyrano the Bear,\\" \\"A Cowboy Named Ernestine,\\" for example) show her enormous illustrative talents better than does \\"Goldie.\\" Rubel is a personal favorite; like other masters of kids' books, she has a great sense of humor and a very personal drawing style.

Signature notation uses the standard notes and symbols one see on most written music.  The advantage is that it conveys rhythm as well as notes; the disadvantage is that it takes a while to learn, especially on fairly complex songs.  Tablature (or \\"Tab\\"), on the other hand, explicitly shows you what frets to play on each string to get the desired notes-but it tells you little or nothing about rhythm and loses some other nuances of signature.<br /><br />My own opinion is that tablature is a great invention for those who don't want to wait until they learn to read signature before they play the songs they really love.  Furthermore, you can get a technical description of the rhythm from the bass signature notation written right above the bass tab notation.  I was playing notes from \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" very soon after reading the tab.<br /><br />There are some problems, however, because tab simply can't convey as much as signature. I suspect also that those who have studied the more traditional signature notation are musicians more likely to have received music lessons and other more formal and more intense personal instruction.  A simple tab book is not a substitute for these.<br /><br />Still, this is a great addition to more formal aspects of learning an instrument.  I'll play scales for an hour, and then try my hand at the bass lines of some of my favorite Hendrix songs.  It helps if you know the music already, or have a CD nearby (a CD is NOT included with the book).  Also, the book would be much better if it included more than one page on how to read tab!  Several pages with additional tab conventions and simple examples are needed here.  On an absolute scale, this book deserves a 4; however, because of the paucity of tab books for bass guitar, and because this contains such sublime, historic music, the book merits a 5. As you might imagine, the beginning bassist will have more luck with the slower songs, those that are more familiar, and those with bass lines that can be matched with the lyrics-it's more difficult to keep track of your bass line when you're playing underneath a Hendrix solo. Highly recommended as a supplementary book, especially for the beginning player.ab books for bass guitar, and because this contains such sublime, historic music, the book merits a 5.

Books	5	30	30	N	N	An Outstanding and Original Achievement	Mr. Barnes, a slightly mysterious rabbit in a blue suit, goes on a train ride in this incredibly engaging and original book. \\"All Aboard\\" combines old-fashioned sensibilities (the first few pages evoked 1950's illustrations to me) with a rarely seen sophistication in the test and illustrations. I loved it.<br /><br />Amiko Hirao's dazzling pictures draw the reader right into the center of the story. You are immersed in the huge color displays, and the cinematic collages and low and high picture angles.  Without showing a single step, she conveys both the upper berth and the aisle of a train; she inserts cut pictures of faces into a colored-pencil nightscape; she startles us with an immense dark tunnel. In one particularly original picture, a child looks directly at the reader, a passenger (only the right arm is shown) reads a yellowed newspaper with the headline \\"Olivia is Born,\\" and a cuff-linked giraffe talks on a cell phone-it's dreamlike, a little noir film in day-glow colors.<br /><br />Mary Lyn Ray's writing also combines the traditional and the original.  There are familiar repetitions and rhythms (although look how she punctuates the following):<br /><br />Whoonk whoonk wahooomk. The trains start slow.<br />But then it begins to roll.<br />Long train, silver train. Long train, silver train.<br />Long train. Silver train. Long train. Silver train.<br />Train, train, train, train.<br />Whooo whoooooo<br /><br />and there are phrases that convey imagery and metaphor: Baggaged boxes \\"sleep,\\" and, as the train rolls along:  \\"A city slides by, strung with lights in the night, like a tug of dreams on a river.\\" Similarly, one page has the familiar cadence of \\" A freight flashes by...Red red yellow green yellow yellow blue green. Vrooom. Vroom. Vroom,\\" but the next page describes how \\"Mr. Barnes likes to look out the window. He likes to see the between.  The between where's he's come from and where he goes to.\\" The book also has a fun surprise ending.  How can you not like an author who dedicates the book \\"for everyone who waves from trains, and all those who wave back?\\"<br /><br />I think that kids from toddler to early grade school age will enjoy the book immensely. However, because of the art and design, teens and adults will appreciate Ray and Hirao's exceptionally talented imagination.

Joanne Ryder and illustrator Carol Schwartz have created a magical book for children from toddler to grade school age.  The narrative is adapted from a poem,  \\"Inside the Science Lab,\\" that Ryder wrote in 1981, and the text retains a very poetic feeling.  The subtle rhymes, assonances, and alliterations are enchanting to read and soothing to hear:<br /><br />On Friday afternoon<br />we file into<br />the science room<br />and find our seats<br />among the plants,<br />among the tanks<br />of lizards, insects,<br />snakes and fish.<br /><br />If I wanted to teach poetry to youngsters, I might begin with this, the very first sentence of \\"One Small Fish.\\" Schwartz works wonders with her gradual melding of a classroom with the ocean and its creatures.  A room with a single aquarium is transformed into a kind of gigantic classroom/aquarium, teeming with exotic fish, crabs, sharks, and eels. Octopi turning book pages with their tentacles sea horses play near the teacher's head, and the narrator rides with dolphins, \\"slipping between the coats that hang like seaweed on the walls.\\" Words and pictures combine for maximal effect, a large school of fish is pictured dashing through an open door, and Ryder uses gerunds like \\"darting,\\" \\"racing,\\" and \\"shooting\\" to describe the action. With all this excitement, the book retains a tone of awe; the fish are either friendly or, at least, benign.  Again, the words help this effect, some passages recall haiku imagery and sensibility. Schwartz's colors are bright but not overpowering, and her depictions of shimmering jellyfish, soft, undulating eels, and those page-turning octopi convey a rhythm of their own.  Only the briefly seen shark seems a bit uninspired.<br /><br />This is one of those rare books that will appeal to a wide age range. It's appropriate for those old enough to read, those who can't read but can follow a spoken story, and to those who will just enjoy the wondrous setting and pictures.  Highly recommended.	2004-10-14

The story  centers on old-fashioned extended family fun, but it is not quite as interesting or engaging  as others in the series.  Still, the portrayal of intergeneration and inter-species love is sweet.

However, to \\"buy\\" into the story line, Pilkey asks that we accept the premise that cats are bored creatures who endure the human-imposed routines. I know this is mere fancy, but I just don't buy it.  Most of the cats I've known are independent and stubborn and are quite able to disrupt routines, plans, and the apparent limits of reason.  Although this is a minor point, I do wish he had framed the story within a more cat-savvy context.<br /><br />Dreaming cats inhabit vivid images that are an escape into the wonders of possibility: \\"Nothing is the same when cats dream...The fishbowl is now an ocean, and cats can dive in.\\" Pilkey does a masterful job of illustrating the transition to a dream state. The black and white illustrations (indicating boredom) undergo an \\"Oz\\"-like transformation into color. Just like people, cats often dream about things they want: \\"When cats dream, someone has always left the back door open, and no cat is afraid.  The big orange dog that lives outside is asleep, snoring, snoring, snoring. And cats dance on his head.\\" Other Freudian elements include a small drawing of a cat hugging a female-looking companion. Cat dreams are happy, exciting, fantastic, imaginative, and without physical bounds. Yet, cat dreams end on a comforting note, because \\"cats must go home,\\" where \\"the other cats sing songs about you.\\"<br /><br />Pilkey's narrative is soothing and rhythmic, and his Picasso, Rousseau and (especially) Chagall-inspired fantasy drawings make this a wonderful going-to-bed book. It's also a possible antidote to a child's fears about sleeping and dreams. Adults will appreciate the artistic allusions, and the sight of their child drifting off to a pleasant cat-like sleep. Pilkey's book is as cozy and warm as having a cat sleeping at the foot of your bed.	2004-09-30

Along with Patricia Polacco and Rosemary Wells, Nicole Rubin is one of my favorite author/illustrators of children's books. Although perhaps not as well known as Polacco and Wells, Rubin earned acclaim for her very popular \\"Rotten Ralph\\" books (a deliciously riotous series she co-created with Jack Gantos), the very clever \\"Cyrano the Bear\\" and \\"A Cowboy Named Ernestine,\\" and many others.<br /><br />One night at dinner, young Ruthie announces the titular \\"No More Vegetables!\\" The next line (\\"She shared her peas and carrots with the dog.\\") exemplifies Rubel's very funny, non-sentimental humor. The palette is just as rich as in her other books, but there's an interesting look here. I thought they looked vaguely Spanish, with a touch of Barcelona's Gaudi.<br /><br />Ruthie clearly dislikes vegetables: She tries to convince her younger brother (and herself) that potato chips and French fries \\"count\\" as vegetables, and later she a nightmare in which vegetable-people chase her. She even recites a poem of rhyming couplets to her class (which includes the line, \\"Offer me slimy beats, I'll stomp them with my feets\\"). Rubel has the kind of emotional honesty that kids will believe and enjoy.<br /><br />Ruthie's mom has a clever plan that has something to do with the girl helping out in the garden. This responsibility, the lack of pressure from her parents, and her own natural hunger has her eating vegetables before too long. This tactic may or may not help your vegetable-aversive child (or spouse), but he or she will enjoy the vibrant colors and pull-no-punches humor. I enjoyed \\"Cyrano\\" and \\"Ernestine\\" somewhat more than this book, but it's another winner by Rubel, and it may just fit the bill for your youngster. Please look into this and other examples of Rubel's fine work. She also has an excellent web page.	2004-09-18

Parents may feel a tinge of recognition at the interrupted sleepover, as Amanda calls home late at night after imagining a monster!<br /><br />Most toddlers will identify with these little pigs, and parents and other readers will probably enjoy sharing the four related short chapters with small fry. The book nicely shows the value of friendship. These two piglets really like each other and are exposed to new things through playing together.  Although, there's nothing groundbreaking or especially inventive about the book, but it's a pleasant enough story with small soothing pictures.  A Dial \\"Easy-to-Read Book\\", rated at grade level 1.8, \\"Amanda\\" is 48 pages long with a picture on each page. A good book for the beginning reader!	2004-09-09

Get This Absolutely Delightful Cowgrrl Tale	Along with Patricia Polacco and Rosemary Wells, Nicole Rubin is one of my favorite author/illustrators of children's books.  Although perhaps not as well known as Polacco and Wells, Rubin earned acclaim for her very popular \\"Rotten Ralph\\" books (a deliciously riotous series she co-created with Jack Gantos), the clever \\"Cyrano the Bear,\\" and many others.<br /><br />This book, \\"A Cowboy Named Ernestine,\\" is a wonderful showcase for Ms. Rubel's prodigious narrative and illustration talents. It starts off grandly:  The story begins against a glorious two-page spread with a gold-tinged sky, showing Ernestine, dressed in beautiful shades of blue, arriving on astagecoach: \\"Ernestine O'Reilly, with hair as red and wild as campfire flames, came all the way from County Clare, Ireland to Lizard Lick, Texas, as a mail-order bride.\\"  The rest of the book has more cowboy colloquialisms and similes:  \\"A figure like a tumbleweed on stilts shambled up. There wasn't a single hair on his head, but below his nose was nothing but hair, making a mighty effort to reach his knees.\\"<br /><br />The pictures are drawn with ink and colored markers, but look rich enough to resemble gouache or acrylic. The bold foreground characters will keep younger audiences interested, while the detailed, idiosyncratic backgrounds will capture the attention of older kids (Ms. Rubel hints that there is at least one small armadillo on every page). The story is sort of a twist on \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Some Like it Hot,\\" as Ernestine escapes the impending marriage by running away dressed in men's clothes. She hooks up with some real cowboys, and tries to escape discovery.  One way she does this is by concocting a tall tale, \\"Turtle Soup,\\" about a cowboy who \\"decided to round up all the turtles in Texas and sell them in El Paso for a fortune.\\"<br /><br />There are other surprises in this rewarding book, and Rubel deserves high recognition for her work here. \\"A Cowboy Named Ernestine\\" is an immensely enjoyable book that succeeds on all levels.  It has colorful characters, consistently funny and inventive dialogue, beautiful pictures done in the \\"Rubelesque\\" manner, and a big-hearted finish.  Very highly recommended!oyable book that succeeds on all levels.

New Rosemary Wells	Rosemary Wells is perhaps best known for her wonderful Max and Ruby books, and she brings the same storytelling talents to the \\"Yoko and Friends\\" series.  However, except for the cover, however,  all the illustrations are by John Nez, who draws in Wells' familiar style.  However, there are subtle yet noticeable differences between Wells' cover illustration and those done by Nez. There's a sly look in the eyes and some shading and coloring effects that are missing from Nez's work. The animal pictures are simply less compelling and mischievous than what Wells draws. Fortunately, Wells wrote this story and it is funny in the way that Wells is always funny:  A basically well intentioned but still disruptive animal creates some benign trouble, incurring the anger of those around him. These snippets of dialogue are funny when read out loud and our child loves Wells' writing.<br /><br />\\"I am making beautiful music!\\" said Timothy.<br />\\"It is a beautiful noise.\\" said Yoko, \\"but it is not music....\\"<br /><br />Timothy the raccoon can't find an instrument to play for the school talent show, and he when does, he plays too loud!  He learns to play the bells (and to read notes with a clever numbering system), and the book shows that while music is lots of fun, it also requires practice.<br /><br />Ms. Wells, in a note following the book, introduces the \\"Yoko\\" series, and encourages parents to spend time reading with their kids. She notes that \\"the stories are all drawn from the experiences my children had in school.\\"  It's not clear why Wells didn't do all the pictures; the same is true in another Yoko book I picked up.  Still, Wells wrote the story, and her influence is felt in the pictures.  I also like the smaller, more portable size of these books. However, get some of the \\"Max\\" and \\"Ruby\\" books for a more complete and satisfying Wells experience.	2004-09-06

Unique recipes, with delicious blends of flavors, fancy yet casual, it is a wonderful place to eat.  Their slogan is the reassuring \\"If it isn't fresh, it isn't legal.\\" While I'm no stranger to well made fresh seafood, the regional touches were wonderfully noticeable and appreciated.<br /><br />The book beings with a brief history of the restaurant that began in Cambridge in 1968, and Legal's hints on selecting and storing fish, a fairly thorough description of fin fill and shellfish, and a briefer description of preferred basic cooking techniques at \\"Legal.\\"  While these section  sometimes reads a bit too much like an advertisement for the restaurant, there is some fascinating \\"inside\\" consumer-friendly facts and anecdotes about selecting and preparing fish-it does show the complexities of ope4ratingf a restaurant and has a lot of good information on health-related matters (although mercury in some types of fish is not mentioned.<br /><br />Recipes are easy to follow and vary in their complexity: I saw one shrimp dish with only 5 ingredients (excluding spices) and, on the facing page, one with twelve.  Although there is no information on preparation time,  these are often misleading without a staff of five to help you) There is a tremendous variety in the types of fish, and the courses in which they are used. In fact, there are over 200 recipes divided into appetizers, main courses, leftovers, salads, pasta and rice dishes with seafood, soups and sandwiches, vegetables and side dishes, sauces and coatings, and even fish desserts!.  There are some wonderful whimsical line drawings by \\"The New Yorker's\\" Edward Koren, and a useful index.  You can buy heftier and more expert-oriented fish cookbooks, but this is one of the more entertaining, creative, and useful ones.  Recommended as a great gift for any afishionado.br />	2004-09-06

Here, Frog finds that it's hard being an amphibian in the winter, especially when compared to his non-amphibian friends, Duck, Pig, and Hare.  It's a nice vehicle for teaching animal types, and the pictures are compelling; however, the last half of the story has a strangely dissonant tone.  I was expecting Frog to somehow adapt to the cold; instead, he winds up half-frozen while looking for wood.  His animal friends rescue him: Hare collects fire wood, Pig cools soup and knits a sweater, and Duck cheers him up.  However, Frog looks \\"bravely\\" tolerant when he gets well and ventures into the snow again. Then Spring comes, Frog is a happy amphibian again, and the story ends with the animals saying how glad they are that Frog is back.  It's not a really satisfying conclusion; it feels like Velthuijs just patched it on at the last minute.  Still, this is a simple introduction to winter and the illustrations by the award winning Velthuijs are delightful.	2004-09-06

In this account of a Crocodile artist and his prospective customer, Elephant, Velthuij paints pictures of Crocodile's paintings, as well as illustrating the text.  Many of these text-related pictures are drawn with framing borders, thus increasing the  `play within a play\\" feeling.  There's also an interesting comment about the enjoyment of art; Velthuij suggests that one's imagination--playing across an empty canvas-creates the best pictures of all.  Elephant is initially angry to learn that the creative magic lies within in hi head rather than the `painted\\" picture, but finally realizes \\"the real beauty of your masterpiece.\\"<br /><br />The book, therefore, is simultaneously pro- and anti-art, if art is defined as a person-made tangible object. It's a little bit confusing, but I doubt that this book's audience is going to get into the philosophical musings that an over-educated adult may contrive. Mostly, this is a simple, fun book, with warm illustrations by the award winning Mr. Velthuijs.  I just wish he hadn't drawn the crocodile smoking a pipe.	2004-08-18

This is a psychologically adept book that is both entertaining and instructive. Most importantly, she shows that while hatred can be learned, it can also be overcome.<br /><br />Eugene Esterhause (\\"Mean Gene\\") beats up other kids, misbehaves badly in class, and uses racial epithets.  The principal, an African American named Mr. Lincoln, overhears Gene using the \\"N\\" word:<br /><br />\\"'I'm going to tell Mr. Lincoln,' she announced.<br />`Go ahead, you little brat. I ain't afraid of that n___' Then he stopped. Mr. Lincoln was standing right there.\\"<br /><br />Polacco continues: \\"Now Eugene was in Mr. Lincoln's thoughts more than ever-he knew he had to find a way to reach him.\\"  Mr. Lincoln connects with Gene as the two build an aviary, building Gene's self-esteem and using Gene's love of different birds as a way to understand that diverse people are united as well.  Later, when Eugene calls two students from Mexico \\"brown-skinned toads,\\" he learns how Gene's father has \\"an ugly name for just about everybody who's different from us.\\" Mr. Lincoln makes him promises to respect all the schoolchildren (\\"my little birds\\"), and learns that there's a grandfather in the picture who does not share Gene's father's prejudice.<br /><br />Depending on the age and maturity of the reader, the story presents many good opportunities for sharing, discussion, and problem solving.  There is little preaching here; instead, Gene learns the power of thinking for one's self, and how youngsters--like baby birds--are shaped by the environment.  As in her superb \\"Thank you, Mr. Falker,\\" Polacco shows how compassionate and firm nurturance can help kids overcome their emotional and social problems.  Of course, these issues aren't always as tractable as depicted in these two books, but they offer kids real solutions and reasons to hope. There is idealism here, but `Mr. Lincoln' also hints at the many complex and entrenched factors that reinforce hate.  As usual, Polacco's unique illustrations convey a wealth of emotion that both soften and enhance the narrative.ere, but `Mr. Lincoln' also hints at the many complex and entrenched factors that reinforce hate.

You are bears. Get used to it.\\"<br /><br />The bears are eventually left to fend for themselves.  Larry discovers the joy of blueberry muffins when humans on a passing boat throw them to the bears.  After drifting to Bayonne, New Jersey, Larry works as a lifeguard (it takes a while for people to catch onto the fact that he is a bear) to earn money for more blueberry muffins. He saves Mr. Frobisher, a wealthy man who buys a hotel so that Larry may continue to lifeguard and earn muffins.<br /><br />This book is not as clever as the two \\"Larry\\" books that follow (\\"At the Hotel Larry\\" and \\"Bongo Larry\\"), but does introduce the bears and the origin of the Larry's blueberry muffin craze.  There's too much narrative and not enough of Pinkwater's celebrated wit. Still, completists will want the entire Larry story, and Jill Pinkwater's illustrations are cheery and bright.  One can easily read the other two books without having read  \\"Young Larry.\\"  However, you might be puzzled by the whole blueberry muffin thing.  Having read this review, however, you are now in the know.	2004-08-03

Published in 1946, it's the first book featuring &quot;Curious George.&quot; George was eventually taken from his habitat by the kind man in the yellow hat, but here we see George with his Mother and seven siblings. The book is filled with both verbal and visual humor (the nine monkeys all sleep together in a gigantically long giraffe bed). The giraffe helps the monkeys play by volunteering to play as a slide, a teeter-totter, and a sailboat. In all of these scenarios, the giraffe volunteers to play, is asked nicely to play, or looks pleased. There's one funny scene where the monkeys make a pair of stilts for Cecily, who is described as &quot;terribly excited&quot; (not coerced). In some deft self-referential humor, Rey draws the giraffe on the stilts &quot;so high the page isn't big enough to show all of her.&quot;<br /><br /> There is only one slightly dissonant note in the book, when the monkeys have tied strings between Cecily's head and outstretched legs to make a harp. For some reason, Cecily's smile looks forced, and the array of strings make her look tied up. Moreover, while Cecily does not object, neither does she explicitly give her permission for this activity. Other than this possibly flawed scene (given the tone of the book, undoubtedly inadvertent), I see only mutual support and friendship. It is also possible that a young reader who is familiar only with the later Curious George books may be upset to know that Curious George apparently left a rather large family behind (I don't know how--or even whether--the author dealt with this in some later book), but you can judge whether this will be troublesome for your audience. Here, however, George and family happily make a new home with the giraffe (after saving her house), and the formerly lonely giraffe has a house full of new friends. This is a creative (but apparently overlooked) book that shows how imagination (and a long neck) can bridge the distance between strangers and lead to fun and mutual help.book that shows how imagination (and a long neck) can bridge the distance between strangers and lead to fun and mutual help.	2004-08-03

Nona and her friend Amelia go to a modern school for magic, but Nona misses her grandmother and the village and leaves the \\"Accademia.\\" (Italian words are sprinkled throughout for atmosphere and authenticity.)  She envies Amelia's diploma from the Academy for Stregas.  But Grandma Concetta consoles her: \\"you don't need a diploma to be a true strega. You already have everything you need...  And when I pass my practice over to you, I will tell you the ingrediente segreto-the secret ingredient.  Then you will not only be a true strega, but a great one.\\" Concetta eventually reveals that the secret ingredient to all the potions made in her pasta pot is love.<br /><br />This is a quiet magic story, with no great adventures or battles.  There's a bit of humor(Amelia curls Nona's hair until it becomes  a beehive of a perm; Nona uses olive oil -instead of magic-to get a goat off the roof), but it's not really a funny book.  Mostly it is a calm, sweet tale of tradition and of people helping each other.  The illustrations are beautiful: The long flowing lines, religious icons, rich colors, and patterned borders recall a tapestry, but lighter and simpler, like the book itself.	2004-08-03

Analyze this too deeply and you'll recognize some basic child-rearing techniques, but Polacco infuses these with so much warmth that they seem to spring, sui generis, from some old folk wisdom held by Babushkas everywhere. The result is a genuinely exciting and lovingly told story enlivened by the fact that it is true.<br />Polacco's illustrations are a treasure.  She has a unique style that combines American influences (Rockwell, American primitives, early cartoons) with eastern European folk art, all drawn in her trademark loopy style. She paints brightly colored, organic looking objects, people, and animals that convey emotion and invite empathy.

Mr. and Mrs. Submarine give shelter--and corn muffins-to a cat (there's a beautiful picture of a cat surrounded by autumnal leaves, with bright green eyes gazing into the house), a huge shaggy dog, a tawny brown horse, crows, a wild coyote, chickens (who wisely stay away from the coyote) and then:<br /><br />a wildebeest , Ludwig van Beethoven (who speaks in German, translations provided), the United state Marine  Band, and more!

You'll be amazed at just how vivid and bright van Dusen's pictures look in this unexpected treat.  The colors seem to jump off the page.  Add that to some super-detailed work  (especially his splashes of water), multiple perspectives, and purposive lack of shading, and you have a kind of magical realism that recalls the best  of Pixar animation.  Yet van Dusen paradoxically evokes a decidedly 50's retro setting and style in his neon-bright gouache illustrations.<br />This is a fun all-rhyming story that quickly engages the reader.  Mr. Magee and his dog Dee decide to go to the sea. Soon,<br />\\"they suddenly spied off the bow to the east<br />A big pod of whales (there were fifty at least!)\\"<br />When a \\"little whale\\" (it's huge) playfully blows them 50 feet up in the air with a blast of water, the boat lands  on the top of a huge tree. Their surprising rescue takes the book to its happy conclusion.<br />Van Dusen's uniquely bold colors and old-fashioned sensibilities combine wonderfully, and the rhyming story flows smoothly with its enthralling pictures and subtle wit.  A great book for elementary school age kids (and anyone else, really) to look at and read aloud; I recommend it very highly!	2004-07-02

Here she creates a wonderfully drawn `folk tale' about a group of kids and their almost encounter with the ghost of Quicksand Bottoms.  Polacco is at the top of  her narrative and  artistic game.<br />On pages 3-4, for example, Polacco foreshortens the perspective, in a manner that evokes Grandma Moses, to show the dozens of towns `folk\\" making Halloween preparations.  (Patricia Polacco is also Dr. Patricia Polacco, with a doctorate in art history).  On the very next two-page illustration, Polacco returns to her familiar loveable loopy style.  She is a master at conveying emotion and character just through splashes of color accenting expressive broad faces.<br />The story is both leisurely and suspenseful, as the Halloween contests and pre-adolescent William's attempts to show Hester a thing or two (i.e., woo her) play against the looming presence of the legendary ghost. William can't seem to get anything right, and he gets \\"mad as the dickens.\\"  Polacco uses colloquialisms to good effect, especially with names: There's Hester Bledden, the object of his affection, as well as Mr. Stillwater, Lula Mae Cobb, Eulaylee Tester, Boof and Bertie Schiffer, all portrayed without condescension.<br />Williams' big opportunity arrives that night \\"as an eerie blue light came up out of the swamp.\\" Polacco's drawing of the swamp gas--or is it?) give us some spectacular blue tones and evanescent effects.<br />The exciting, well-plotted denouement gives frustrated William a chance too show his bravery and win the heart of Hester, as they share a plate of ice cream.  This is a beautifully drawn and written story, and is one of the best of the Polacco's many superb books.  Teachers, parents, other  adults, and kids  will also want to check out her fun and informative website.	2004-06-30

But unlike other children, his dreams spill out of his head in bright colors, coloring the drab landscape around him.  Furthermore, his young friends accidentally discover that wet objects will hold these color daydreams. However, on a rainy day, his dreams literally paint the town red, and blue, and yellow, and green.<br />Up to this point, the story is exciting and the illustrations, richly shaded in a slight change from Polacco's more typical style, accurately portray both the drab and the bright. But halfway through, the story turns to a lost children motif, and, somewhat predictably, Appelemando's ability to color the sky leads to their rescue.  There's a nice message here about having friends who believe in you and the importance of dreaming, but both the narrative and the pictures are a bit too uninspired for someone of Polacco's enormous talent.  The dream that rescues the wanderers is bright enough, but not varied enough.... just designs that spell out \\"Help Us.\\" and more pictures of animals and smallish abstract shapes.  A 5 for any other author, but relative to Polacco's other book, this merits only a 4.  Take a look at \\"Casey at the Bat,\\" \\"Picnic at Mudsock Meadow,\\" \\"Thunder Cake,\\" the `Babushka' series, and many others to get a truer picture of Polacco's magnificence.	2004-06-30

Larry is a huge but friendly polar bear who lives in a hotel and hangs out in the icy cold pool.  This is a jokey-book, but even when the humor is predictable, the Pinkwaters' dry as ice delivery is irresistible: \\"NOTICE TO GUESTS: MAKE SURE THE BEAR LIKES YOU BEFORE USING THE POOL.\\"<br /> \\"...Guests ask [my mother] `How can we tell if the bear likes us?'<br /> \\"...oh, the bear likes everybody.\\"<br /> Very few guests use the pool.<br /> Later the narrator (a young teenage girl) takes a mildly disguised Larry out for blueberries: \\"people think he is just a big fat man with whiskers, wearing a pair of slippers that look like fuzzy bear paws.\\"  Then the rim-shot:<br />\\"If anyone were to ask I would say that Larry is my uncle from Milwaukee.\\"<br />The one potentially tricky part of the book occurs when Larry takes his first trip to the zoo and sees his brother Roy.  But the zoo is a fun place for them to meet and swim together and fool a few visitors as well. The zookeeper even lets Roy and his two pool mates out for the night, and they have codfish cakes and blueberries at the hotel Larry.  Although I paused for a bit, the gentle good-natured tone drowns out any dissonance regarding free and captive polar bears:  It's a kids' book, and the Pinkwaters' combination of deft prose, and bold, colorful pictures set a happy tone of fantasy and bearish camaraderie.  Also check out Larry in \\"Bongo Larry,\\" in which he eats (what else?) blueberries and plays the blues at a local club. Good fun, and definitely recommended.	2004-06-24

The young narrator talks about how she's generally a good person: &quot;...I'm a really good kid. I smile a lot because usually I'm happy, and I give excellent hugs.&quot; She behaves even when her brother knocks over her blocks.<br />&quot;But,&quot; she explains, &quot;sometimes I'm Bombaloo.&quot; She shows her teeth, makes fierce noises and scrunches up her face.&quot; I use my feet and my fists instead of my words.&quot; She knows that later, after a time-out (&quot;I have to go take some time for myself and think about it&quot;), she'll calm down and apologize to her brother. But the book doesn't minimize the strength of the feelings: &quot;But while I'm Bombaloo, I'm not sorry; I'm angry. I hate everybody and everything...&quot;<br />The author shows a calm, factual empathy in her narrator's voice &quot;And I'm sorry and a little frightened. It's scary, being Bombaloo. My mother knows that. She hugs me and helps me clean up...,&quot; and, after making up with her brother, &quot;we build a new castle together.&quot; The book neither excuses nor judges Bombaloo-style anger. Instead, it shows the feelings that occur before, during, and after it, and offers parents and kids the hope of resolution. 29 pages, with excellent, evocative illustrations by Yumi Heo.	2004-06-24

A young girl, overly demanding of her grandmother (\\"Babushka\\"), learns what it's like on the receiving end when her grandmother's doll comes to life and makes demands on the girl. This is not, however, typical Polacco because there's a subtle punitive quality to the doll's incessant demands and misbehavior: \\"'You didn't do it right,\\" said the doll... Natasha began to cry. \\"I'm just a little girl,\\" she said between sobs.  I wish you were just a doll.\\"'<br />However, I think that Palocco's evocation of a fairy tale (which often contain gruesome scenes, unlike the mild consequences here), and her warm, very colorful illustrations soften the doll's \\"vengeance.\\"  This is not \\"Chuckie.\\"  And in the end, her grandmother slyly tells her that she must have been dreaming (although we are led to believe that the doll really did come to life), and we are reassured that `Natasha turned out quite nice after all.'<br />Palocco's large, loopy illustrations are always a treasure, and here, the pencil, pen, and acrylic bring some enchantment and a sense of fun to Natasha's \\"lesson.\\"	2004-06-23

Despite his good intentions, George adventures turn into misadventures: Dousing someone's campfire, getting lost with a galloping deer, and being sprayed by a skunk that George thought was a cat. As usual in these series (story by Margret Rey, with illustrations by a team in the style of the late H.A. Rey), George's curiosity also leads  to some monkey heroics.  He also learns how  to get rid of skunk smell (a vat of tomato juice).<br /><br />Given its forest setting, this is a somewhat quieter `George book,' but there are soft forest and animal drawings and enough action for the small ones. Curious George is now \\"a registered trademark of the Houghton Mifflin,\\" but the company encourages young readers to look for the `original adventures about Curious George' by the Reys. 24 pages, with pencil and watercolor illustrations on each one.	2004-06-22

In fact, I thought this might become a parody of the moral about the race not always going to the swiftest (maybe the fitter hare might win for once).  However, the two animals take their customary roles after this initial originality. It's the familiar tale after all, with some reworking of the pieces.<br />Illustrations are quirkily interesting, colorful though not vibrant, and a bit too cluttered.  Jones shows a deft narrative touch when she describes the other animals helping Tortoise (\\"A family of frogs jumped into their pond and splashed water all over Tortoise to cool him down.\\"), and she pulls off an exciting finish line.<br />Neatly cut holes in the center of each page (the pages resemble a collection of old 45 vinyl sleeves) reveal the center of the facing illustration.  This is a nice, slightly updated rendering of the fable that younger kids will especially enjoy, but it's not as satisfying as it might have been.	2004-06-22

The narrative has a superb rhythm that lends excitement to the text: &quot;There's a lion in the jungle and he's really on the run!&quot;  Colorful and imaginative illustrations match the vivid story.  Sure it's unrealistic, the lion might eat the other animals--but this is a very fun kids' book to read and hear.	2004-05-06

The book does not say whether or not it is based on a traditional Persian/Iranian story.  Partly due to this, the phrasing sometimes seems labored, as if the author is straining to make this sound authentic and indigenous.<br />At the suggestion of the kind, poor but kind farmer's daughter to whom he is betrothed, he young male protagonist rejects to seek his fortune. He buys a dancing tiger from a mysterious woman in the market and within a year he returns home a rich man.  However, his betrothed now seems beneath a man of his wealth and potential. There are some surprises along the way to the happy ending, but not enough humor. More importantly, the denouement happens abruptly and too quickly, like a bedtime story rushed to a conclusion before the child falls asleep.<br />There's a bit of Matisse seen in the eastern motifs, the splashes of color, and the shallow perspective. The parchment look of the paper, yellow and somewhat speckled lends a folk-tale atmosphere, but the colors are sometimes a little washed out and muddy. At times, I yearned for  bigger  splashes  of color  as in the excellent illustration on pages 12-13, an exotic collection of gold, purples, turquoise and mauve, that evoke Constantinople and  the Middle East.  This  is a very good book, but one that could perhaps have been even better.	2004-05-02

The main problem is that the myriad observations-- divided into 54 short excerpts-- fail to advance a plot, although we do get deeper into Nory's head. It just gets very tedious after awhile.<br />I would recommend this as a book from which to read snippets, but Baker would have done better to write a shorter book, or to have some semblance of a plot. Although the style and characters are quite different, try &quot;Zazie Dans Le Metro&quot; for another, more interesting look at young female adolescense. It's offbeat and ultimately more satisfying.	2004-04-30

Jill Pinkwater's vivid, varied colors (pen and ink, and colored marker) and Daniel Pinkwater's droll prose combine for another hit.  Here, Larry gets in trouble after eating 250 pounds of ice cream from the walk-in freezer at Cohen's Cones. Larry is full of excuses, including a claim that he ate the ice cream in his sleep! After hearing of his exploits (\\"Bear eats 1/8 Ton Ice Cream\\"), Mr. I. Berg comes to the Hotel Larry with a proposition to enhance the reputation of the Iceberg Ice-Cream Company: A new line of Larry ice cream bars, including codfish flavor.  Somehow it all goes well, even with the company's dubious new slogan--a quote from Larry--\\"I do not feel sick!\\"<br />This is a simple yet very entertaining story that succeeds because of the dry humor that Pinkwater injects throughout the book. There's a bit of a wink to the reader, but it's never too obvious or condescending--Pinkwater plays it straight.  Just about as good as &quot;Bongo Larry,&quot; and printed on high quality paper with excellent illustrations, this would be an excellent gift for any animal/ice cream lover that you know.	2004-04-21

Polacco's story evokes the attendant feelings of inferiority and isolations, as well as her grateful joy upon finally reading an entire paragraph.<br />The story opens with a family ritual later expanded into a full story in Polacco's \\"The Bee Tree\\": Her grandfather drizzles some honey on a book cover and tells her \\"knowledge is like the bee that made that sweet honey, you have to chase it through the pages of a book.\\"<br />Polacco draws in her trademark big loopy style; her palette and composition superbly capture emotion, particularly in the close-ups. She can convey a range of feelings simply by how she places color on a person's face. She's one of the most original and recognizable illustrators around.  One of the most heartfelt and moving books you'll find in children's literature.	2004-04-19

Fatima Shaik's combination of free verse and rhyme evoke the syncopation of jazz, and the writing is full of rich similes that describe the feelings of sound: \\"The sound is like slippers slipping and scraping on the long gravel streets. The songs growl like mad boys who fall too hard to their beds.\\"  Although the book is short on plot, children will enjoy watching the procession and celebration of the neighborhoods' residents.  After marching through the streets, the musicians and dancers \\"pause ...to silently recollect the reason we gather together at all\\":<br />Because the tradition<br />of love is our mission.<br />The book has some of the most beautiful watercolors I've seen recently, but the city is too sanitized and bereft of its color, stripped of some of its distinctive grit and realism. There's a great picture showing an example of traditional New Orleans architecture, but I would have liked more.  A nice touch is the Author's Note about the history of New Orleans marching jazz bands and the \\"second line\\" of dancers who follow them.	2004-04-19

What are you rebelling against?\\" \\"What have you got,&quot; Larry asked.<br />There are similarly fine touches throughout, the narrator's wife is named Semolina, Larry write a profoundly unprofound beat poem called \\"Are Muffins Like Fish?\\" (which culminates in \\"I like blueberry muffins but there are no blueberry fish.\\"), and paints an abstract painting of muffins and fish, and, finally, Larry goes to the \\"Care Mama Bear,\\" where he bongos behind  \\"Big Bear's\\" vocals.  The only inauthentic touch is that Big Bear's jazz opus is really the blues.<br />There are vivid, colorful pictures throughout that capture Larry's abundant cool.

The Horrible Trouble with Hally Tosis	Books	4	12	13	N	N	4  ½*  Tongue Wags the Dog	The pleasingly familiar illustrations and comic sensibilities (i.e., silly, punny, off-hand) of famed children's writer Dav Pilkey are evident from the first line  (and its accompanying illustration): \\"There once was a dog named Haley, who lived with the Tosis family.\\"  (Get it--Haley Tosis?).  This dog is so smelly that Mona Lisa holds her nose, a skunk tries to hide, and Grandma Tosis faints after Haley gets in her face.  After this, there are some typical Pilkey puns and visual humor as the family kids try to clean up her act.<br />After Haley saves her human family from some burglars, she becomes \\"the most famous crime-fighting dog in the country.\\"  The last page is quintessential Pilkey: The Tosis family, clothespins pinching their noses, gathers around Haley in an overstuffed chair, happy to keep their dog \\"Because life without Haley Tosis just wouldn't make any scents.\\"  Although the book has other such puns and clever pictures, it's  mostly for younger kids.  Pilkey really reaches his zenith in the \\"Captain Underpants\\" series, which features humor that is both more outrageous and layered.  There's more fun and irreverence in those books, but this is a good introduction to Pilkey for the younger set.	2004-04-19

Steve Martin's Mirabelle is bright and beautiful, and also clinically depressed and clinically bored (if there were such a thing). She's a salesperson exiled to the glove department Siberia of an expensive L.A. department store. She has artistic aspirations and talent, but she is neither pursuing her interests nor herself in any coordinated fashion.  She is drawn sympathetically, as someone who is doing the best she can, even if that's not working out too well.<br />Enter Roy Porter, the self-made millionaire who is entranced by Mirabelle and also secretly sees her as a woman from whom he can learn from, taking what he can from their relationship while preparing for the 'real one.'  Mirabelle is used, but she finally realizes this. Because of and despite Roy's noncommittal, inauthentic love, she is able to  learn from the experience (finding an authentic relationship, moving to San Francisco, and landing a new job, with Roy's assistance, in an art gallery.)  After the pain and the learning form the relationship with Roy, Mirabelle is able to announce to her new love \\"I'm, fixing myself.\\"  she says  to her new sig. other. It's a little too neat, this self-discovery and road to recovery, but we can forgive that because Mirabelle has always had an inner strength, so it seems at  least plausible. As for Roy Porter, \\" he sees, finally, that as much as he believed he was imposing his will on her, she was also imposing her need on him, and their two dispositions interlocked.\\"<br />There are echoes of \\"Pretty Woman' here: Self-realization blooming from a somewhat exploitative relationship, which is redeemed by the 'growth' of both characters at the end.  Shopgirl, however, has a more realistic ending than \\"Pretty Woman,\\" and Martin's writing is notable for it's incisive portraiture, insight, and something akin to humanity in his empathy for the characters.<br />A main problem is the omniscient voice that Martin employs, explaining what Roy, for example, sees as his reason for doing something, but then interjecting (as narrator) the real motivation-a force or feeling of which Roy is unaware.  This device is used too often, and it becomes annoying:<br />\\"This fact-finding mission, in the guises of philandering , is  necessary because as a youth he failed too observe women properly. He never sorted them into types, or catalogued their neuroses so he could spot them again from the tiniest clue. He is now taking a remedial course in F---ing 101, to learn how to handle the diatribes, inexplicable antics, insults and misunderstandings...  But he is not aware that he is on such a serous mission: he thinks he is a bachelor having a good time.\\"  (Whether this is Roy's somewhat askew take on women or Martin's  is not quite clear to me.)  In addition, the descriptions of Roy's lust are meant to convey some sort of unafraid direct use of language, but again, it gets tiresome; OK-we know you're not reluctant to use a four-letter word, but it's not the first time we've seen it.<br /> The author's voice is just a bit too present. It's difficult to not go that route with a story as psychologically rendered as this one.  However, if that voice had receded a bit it  would be less transparently connected to Mr. Martin, and its impact subtler and more powerful.

He cleverly uses an old mousetrap to create his own wire sculpture of a mouse swinging on a mousetrap, and enters it into a museum competition. There's a lot of visual humor, and Freeman makes the whole tuxedo-ed affair look fun and interesting, and there's a suspenseful subplot involving the guard trying to find Norman.  (No animals were injured in the writing of the book.) There's a nice warm simplicity to Freeman's soft but colorful pastel illustrations; they're drawn with such ease that both they and the story may stimulate your own creative energy.

If you're familiar with Disneyland this is NOT an indispensable book, but it will give you some tips and information that you probably weren't aware of.  There are plenty of time and money-saving tips, and suggestions for getting the most out of your visit. Disneyland rides, restaurants, and shops are described, with some little-known facts keeping things interesting.  However, the book is for fans of the \\"Magic Kingdom,\\" not detractors, and this is most definitely a tour book, not an expose or even a very critical review.  The critiques of the various rides are too uniformly favorable; even the Roger Rabbit Ride in Toontown, a manic ride short on content and fun, and long in wait-time, receives the same generally favorable review as the better rides. To sum, I would have preferred a slightly more opinionated guidebook.<br />The book also explores the three Disneyland Resort Hotels, as well as surrounding hotels, restaurants, and regional non-Disneyland activities (e.g., two pages on local surfing ands swimming, a nod to rival Knott's Berry Farm, and much more).  The book, which is updated annually, includes coupons, and an entire chapter on the relatively new \\"California Adventure\\" section.	2004-03-25

The young narrator talks about how she's generally a good person:  \\"...I'm a really good kid.  I smile a lot because usually I'm happy, and I give excellent hugs.\\"  She behaves even when her brother knocks over her blocks.<br /> \\"But,\\" she explains, \\"sometimes I'm Bombaloo.\\" She shows her teeth, makes fierce noises and scrunches up her face.\\" I use my feet and my fists instead of my words.\\" She knows that later, after a time-out (\\"I have to go take some time for myself and think about it\\"), she'll calm down and apologize to her brother. But the book doesn't minimize the strength of the feelings: \\"But while I'm Bombaloo, I'm not sorry; I'm angry. I hate everybody and everything...\\"<br />The author shows a calm, factual empathy in her narrator's voice \\"And I'm sorry and a little frightened. It's scary, being Bombaloo.  My mother knows that. She hugs me and helps me clean up...,\\" and, after making up with her brother, \\"we build a new castle together.\\"  The book neither excuses nor judges Bombaloo-style anger. Instead, it shows the feelings that occur before, during, and after it, and offers parents and kids the hope of resolution.  29 pages, with excellent, evocative illustrations by Yumi Heo.	2004-03-23

A nearly perfect book with a rhythmic narrative and richly stylized illustrations, \\"Loud Emily\\" is an engaging and informative book that I highly recommend.  It's the story of Emily, a little girl who voice started out LOUD and just got LOUDER: \\"But as Emily grew, so did her voice. It rattled the brasses. It shimmied the crystals. It shattered the plates as they crashed to the floor.\\"<br />There's a great narrative flair here, and the book is fun to read.  The illustrations, depicting mid-19th century houses and ships, are done with a \\"crackle\\" technique, and some pictures recall needlework or stenciling.  The illustrator also has fun accenting a sort of American Gothic style with humorous  touches and a tad of parody.<br />The message here (and it is subtle and secondary to the story) is that there is a niche for everyone.  For Emily, it is aboard a 3-masted sailing ship: \\"Can you call an order from the fo'c'sle to quarter-deck above a gale force wind?\\" peeped Captain Baroo.  \\"AYE AYE, CAPTAIN!\\"  she said.  Before the captain could say \\"Mizzenmast,\\" Emily called,  \\"ALL HANDS ON DECK!\\" and every ship's crew came running.\\"<br />The story has humor, drama, emotion, and action. You will share your child's delight when reading lines such as \\"AVAST! LUFF HER UP BEFORE WE\\"RE STOVE!\\" (the endpapers have a glossary!), and seeing the big ship rolling over a huge green sea. There's also an imaginative surprise ending.<br />This is that rare book which is both literate and fun, and where the sparkle of the prose is matched by the stylish originality of the pictures.  One of the best children's books I've read in years, it's about 38 pages long including endnotes, and recommended by the publisher for children 4-8 years old.  However, I think it might appeal to a much broader audience as well!	2004-03-23

Her expressive, folksy, slightly loopy style are all her own, and she has long been one of my favorite illustrators. Here, the warm, homey pictures just draw you into the story, and suffuse it with the familiarity of a family heirloom.  That's part of the magic here:  Polacco's stories and colors are so vivid and personal that they seem like par t of your own history, when really she is merely honoring everyone's personal history in general.  The colors are vibrant and soft at the same time, the narration has action and unique characterizations, and the obliquely offered message is even more powerful for it's brevity.  Very definitely recommended, and I encourage you to discover more of her work!	2004-03-22

Books	4	10	10	N	N	4 1/2* Sometimes the Best Gifts Don�t  Even Come Packaged	This yarn is about a young girl's presumably forgotten birthday, mixed in with a pseudo-scary hunt for the dreaded \\"Clay Pit Bottoms Monster.\\" The girl, Patricia, and her brother visit their divorced dad, an interesting figure who suggests after work that they look for the monster and take the first ever picture of it. Patricia is disappointed that her birthday was apparently forgotten, but she, her dad, brother, and cousin experience fun, excitement, and the unmistakable strength of her father's love as they try to lure the creature out of the lake.  There's a surprise birthday cake (decorated with a rubber monster on top!) waiting for Patricia after they run home thinking they've met the \\"monster.\\"  Polacco ends with a nice touch:  Her protagonist reports \\"Then everyone sang `Happy Birthday' to me. My dad sang the loudest-and off-key, of course.  That's my dad.\\"<br />There's a bit too much narration in Polacco's story, and her inimitable illustrative style is not as fully realized as in \\"The Bee Tree \\" (1998), Casey at the Bat (1997), or some of her other best work. Still, this late 1950's period piece has all the elements that make this author/illustrator one of my favorites:  Warmth, the building of memories, and a uniquely enjoyable illustrative style.	2004-03-22

Spot discovers that school is fun and interesting  in this flap book by Eric Hill.  After a warm greeting by his teacher and classmates, Spot hides (under one of the flaps found on every page) when it's time to sing a song.  \\"I can't sing,\\" he says. There is no resolution to this (maybe some pages were torn out of my copy?), but Spot soon finds plenty to do as the disjointed plot reveals Spot's fun activities at school. These include finding dress-up clothes in a small playhouse, spelling the word \\"DOG\\" with blocks, story time by the teacher, playing teeter-totter (Spot is cleverly hidden under a flap that is part of a tree), and painting paw prints. When his mom picks him up and asks, \\"How was school, Spot?\\" he answers with a resounding \\"Great!\\" Twenty-two brightly colored pages showing Spot enjoying school after some initial uncertainty.	2004-03-21

The guests are hidden under flaps, but both Spot and your reader can find clues to who's hiding even before lifting the flap (e.g., a silhouette, a banana peel, his mom's tail sticking out from beneath a table).  Bright colors and a variety of uncovered animals make this a fun book, though the title is a bit misleading. The book really has very little to do with Spot's birthday until the very last page, when all the animals are shown bringing presents.  The bold black text also makes this a nice book for the beginning reader.  22 pages.	2004-03-21

The focus is on the famous: Great big photos of silver screen idols from the silent days through the studio era and beyond. There's a bit of history (mostly tangential to the people making the movies), a little scandal, good &quot;behind the scenes&quot; images and facts, and some attention to non-American film, but this is mostly the public face of Hollywood.  &quot;Life Goes to the Movies&quot; features an outstanding collection of large format photos, many of them familiar (although many of them will be new to readers). The overriding spirit is a celebration, not of &quot;film,&quot; but of what fans know and love as the &quot;movies.&quot;	2004-02-23

Many a man has been swept away on nights like this one.'\\"<br />Indeed! Read this sumptuous seafaring book with a briny pirate's accent and you and your child will be similarly swept away. Preston McClear and Nicholas Dollak's exotic tale of bravery, danger, love, and mystery is told with bravado and panache. The book is perhaps best read aloud: There's an element of parody here that's captured best by the spoken word. (For example, the phrases  \\"many a sailor,\\" \\"many a man,\\" and \\"many an adventure\\" all appear within the first six pages. At first, this repetition seemed like an oversight, later I realized what fun these phrases contain when read aloud.)<br />The setting moves from ship to deserted island to trading port with several interesting plot turns. Nicholas Dollak's illustrations are tremendous: Luminescent, dreamy, and vibrant. These are some of the best illustrations I've seen recently (he and Yuyi Morales are among my favorite new illustrators). Dollak's palette and imagination suffuse the book with a fitting magical realism.<br />The book is 34 pages long, and includes several full-page illustrations. There is an additional 4 page \\"featurette\\" called  \\"How We Make a Book,\\" Dollak's account of Malibu Books' history.  As always, the company uses high quality paper that is a pleasure to handle and view. Very highly recommended. (Their other works include \\"The Boy under the Bed,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Frannie and Pickles.\\" I look forward to more books from this team.)	2004-01-11

A colorful book that doesn't quite reach its potential,  \\"The Boy Under the Bed\\" is about a young monster, Giles, with nighttime fears that a BOY may be hiding under his bed!  When he calls his big-headed (literally), tusked parents into his room, the boy disappears.  (The parents later comfort/admonish their son by saying \\"...THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS BOYS.\\")  But Giles knows better:<br />\\"But once the lights are turned out that mischievous boy is at it again, whooping, hollering, and laughing. Jumping from the dresser to the floor and thumping against the door. Wearing a sheet and saying \\"BOO TO YOU!!!\\"<br />Preston McClear and Nicholas Dollak produce playful, colorful books: There's a purposeful discontinuity between the illustrations (a poster on the monster's bedroom door changes 3 times in 3 successive pages) and the effect is like the \\"I Spy\\" books or \\"Where's Waldo.'  The monsters are-let's face it-refreshingly ugly, unlike the shaggy but adorable creatures of Maurice Sendak.  Still, the first section of the book lacks sufficient imagination, the writing is sometimes a bit forced, and most of the illustrations are from one perspective only-it's a little flat.<br />The second \\"act\\" is much better, as Giles breaks out of his bedroom to courageously help the boy find his way back home.  And what a home it is!  After journeying through \\"door #10\\" they climb a spiral staircase to a `mighty tree-house perched in the skies.\\"  It's a remarkable illustration.... row upon row of beds in a Central Park like setting; it's a multi-treed tree house! Boys appear from everywhere, climbing and swinging like monkeys and quite easily forming an easy friendship with the formerly scary boy: \\"Three cheers for my friend the monster!\\"  Freed from the confines of Gile's bedroom, Nicholas Dollak produces beautiful, cinematic images of the boys and monster romping about the vast tree house.<br />I would have liked to see more of this imaginative style in the beginning of the book.  Still, the subtle message about facing your fears and finding similarities is a helpful one, and the tree house scenes and peaceful ending make it a satisfying experience. (52 pages of text and illustrations on very high quality paper; Malibu again sets a standard for quality production.)  Look for McClear and Dollak's stunning \\"The Sailor and the Sea Witch\\" and the very funny  \\"Frannie and Pickles\\" as well!ok.

Both the left- and right-facing pages lift up (flaps) to reveal more pictures and text underneath, resulting in a three-page spread.  One interesting feature is that some flaps open horizontally while others open vertically.  There's not much of a story, and the under-flaps don't always relate to the covering page, but the toddler set probably won't notice. Bright, simple illustrations, and durable pages make this a winner.	2003-12-09

The latter include the following: SORT, PRINT, PLOT, FREQ, MEANS, CORR, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Regression. Although the book warns that it does not teach statistics, it somewhat accomplishes this through explanations of the programming statements and the resulting output.  Of course, it is not a substitute for a stats text. Indeed, some of the more complicated stats are reviewed in a cursory manner that was confusing or had little or no explanation: \\"This pattern might be the result of autocorrelation-we could use the P option in GLM to get a Durbin-Watson statistic to check for this,\\" without any explanation of autocorrelation.<br />For those of us who use datasets that are already set up, the emphasis on inputting cards in the beginning chapters is somewhat annoying.  However, this may be more appropriate for students assigned work with small sets of raw data.  It's not a very long book, but I recommend it for getting right to several of the most frequently used PROCS.  On the other hand, some of the explanations could have been expanded for clarity; it may have been better to cover fewer statistical procedures but to explain each one in a more user-friendly style.  Not including the somewhat superfluous Appendices (\\"Getting Started: The SAS System at Your Installation,&quot; and \\"More About the SAS System&quot;) the book is only 89 pages long.	2003-12-04

I don't know why anyone would purchase the Solutions book only instead of the set (perhaps a copy of the SAS Workbook&quot; is available).<br />These are challenging problems, probably most appropriate for the intermediate to intermediate-advanced SAS programmer. The answer book is limited to solutions, with little or no discussion of pitfalls, alternatives, or the logic behind the answers. Therefore, if you do not immediately understand the solution, you will need to work backwards, pick it apart, or use some other technique (like asking someone). This somewhat limits its audience to those who are more experienced. I hope either Cody or someone else will have a more instructive answer book in the future. Still, at this time, with so few books like this available, this is a great way to test and expand your knowledge. (Although you may also wish to examine the shorter but cheaper &quot;test&quot; book by Robert Virgile, also available from Amazon.)<br />The four sections of the &quot;Workbook&quot; are &quot;Data Step Programming,&quot; &quot;Procedures,&quot; &quot;SAS Programming Techniques,&quot; and &quot;Statistics Problems.&quot; Each of these sections has several brief topics; for example, Data Step Programming includes combining data sets, using IF-THEN/ELSE and other logical operators, numerical functions, dates, arrays, and working with longitudinal data.<br />Why two separate books? Cody explains that the &quot;solution is obvious once you see it&quot; and &quot;the learning potential of the book is lost.&quot; He therefore &quot;removed the temptation for students to flip to the back of the book.&quot; (Come now, aren't we more disciplined than that?). A more persuasive argument is that &quot;teachers may...feel more comfortable in assigning problems without the solutions too close at hand.&quot; Recommendation: Buy the set, especially if you are an intermediate to advanced user.in assigning problems without the solutions too close at hand.&quot; Recommendation: Buy the set, especially if you are an intermediate to advanced user.	2003-12-04

After establishing the close, special relationship between Frannie and her dog (Pickles rides on the backseat of Frannie's two-wheel bicycle), the plot turns to their sudden change in behavior.<br />One of the trickiest aspects of this genre is how to explain the switch:  was it a magic spell or potion, or perhaps a dream?  The author takes what I think is the right course for a children's book--it just happens without a lot of hoopla:<br />\\"One day Frannie and Pickles were having tea. Frannie said, 'Pickles, darling, I sure do feel odd.' Frannie lapped up the rest of her tea.\\"<br /> The book's text and illustrations show the wild and very funny consequences: One of my favorites is the book cover (also found on page 20) of Pickles driving while Frannie hangs her head out the window with her tongue and hair waving. Other adventures include Frannie chasing the postman, and catching a Frisbee thrown by Pickles.<br />I was quite impressed with Nicholas Dollak's unique illustrations: Rather than appeal to a common denominator, the pictures show an incredible amount of style and sophistication. They don't condescend to the reader by oversimplifying.  The colors are bold and usually only one main idea is pictured (which is great for a younger audience), but there are plenty of details and verbal and visual jokes for the older reader as well.(However, cat lovers might want to know that there are some small pictures showing minor violence by mice against a cat.) 34 pages on very high quality paper.  This is a very fun book, and I look forward to more work from this team.	2003-12-04

Ron Cody is the master of SAS educational books: His clear informal style is undaunting, he supplies plenty of examples, and he explains both what you need to know and why you need to know it.<br />Many books teach SAS programming, but few of them explain how to identify &quot;hidden&quot; errors, such as duplicate observations, out-of-range or missing values, and whether an ID value is in each of two or more files.  These are important checks, because programs will often run and look fine, even though they may contain these database errors (or, if not errors, assumptions that are not true).<br />The majority of the book is for intermediate to advanced users who set up databases for statistical manipulation.  Although Cody tries to simplify things, it appeared that some techniques such as PROC SQL and macros assume some prior basic knowledge.  However, as evident from the chapters listed below, there are valuable lessons that will help intermediate (and even some &quot;advanced beginners&quot; ) level users.<br />Chapters:<br />1. Checking Values of Character Variables<br />2. Checking Values of Numeric Variables<br />3. Checking for Missing Values<br />4. Working with Dates<br />5.

(Isaakson writes that Franklin was motivated by the belief that \\"to put forth benefits for the common good is divine\\").  Franklin played an important role in treaties with England and France, and was an initially reluctant but thereafter adamant proponent of independence from England. His Albany Plan (1754) and Articles of Confederation (1775) were early and eventually influential efforts to balance federal sovereignty and union with states' interests.<br /><br />The fault of the book, then, is its subject, but how Isaacson writes about him.  Its chief fault is the lack of narrative flair:  With the notable exception of the first and last chapters, we have a chronological account broken into small sections. Here's one particularly mundane succession: \\"Constitutional Ideas\\" (a mere 2 pages),\\" \\"Meeting Lord Howe Again (5 pages),\\" \\"To France, with Temple and Benny (4 pages).\\"  A more satisfying approach would have traced Franklin's domestic political thought in one larger chapter, but this would violate Isaakson's chronological imperative.  At times the book's equally weighted, well-ordered facts yield a pace that is both plodding and boring.  The book is best when it manages to integrate larger themes with the strictly biographical details.<br /><br />Comparing this biography with David McCullough's popular \\"John Adams,\\" shows that McCullough's book is more fully realized and more \\"modern,\\" as he interprets themes and implications within broader contexts.  Isaacson, at his worst, reads more like a chronicler as he emphasizes neatly compartmentalized facts that tend to obscure larger themes.  McCullough simply writes with greater narrative flair: His book contains both precision and drama, and, contrary to this book, it's never a struggle to get through.  Although Franklin's pragmatism perhaps limits how analytic Isaakson can be, there is, generally speaking, not enough about the larger context of American intellectual and cultural history (with the exceptions noted above). For example, there is only superficial discussion of whether Franklin's dream of a great middle class has been realized. Moreover, while some critics claim that McCullough is too admiring of Adams, Isaakson somewhat glosses over Franklin's negative personal qualities.  Franklin was a great political compromiser, but he appears somewhat rigid in other matters.<br /><br />Only in the last chapter does Isaacson fully delve into larger themes. He accomplishes this in 17 excellent pages showing American intellectual reaction to him from the time of his contemporaries through the present. He describes the variations in criticism, such as the great esteem for Franklin among rationalists (during the Age of Enlightenment) and American pragmatists, but also describes the Romantics' disdain of bourgeois practicality, and the critiques written by early 20th century intellectuals (e.g., Max Weber wrote \\"All Franklin's moral attitudes are colored with utilitarianism.\\").  In October 2000, however, critic David Brooks wrote that our \\"founding Yuppie\\" would be comfortable in today's middle class, sharing their \\"optimistic, genial, and kind\\" values and their secular and religious-based activism.  At the conclusion of the book, Isaacson briefly weighs the evidence, and, not surprisingly, praises Franklin's values and his deeply felt \\"faith in the wisdom of the common citizen.\\"  Had the rest of the biography been written with more of the insight and depth shown in this chapter, the book would have been much better.this book, it's never a struggle to get through.

(This would have been helpful in discerning which jokes are relatively old, and which just sound old.) Some of the material is fairly trite, deriding such easy targets as umpires and over zealous fans.  Most of them are quite funny though, including a picture of seven infielders gathered close to home as one fan explains to another \\"They expect him to bunt,\\" and another showing an umpire pondering how to call a play with a wonderful Jack Benny-like expression and the equally Benny-esque caption \\"I'm thinking!&quot; (with 'thinking' underlined).<br />A major problem is the formatting, all the `toons are given equal size, and hence equal weight. A number of these are just \\"throwaway\\" jokes, pictures and captions without much weight or originality. As a small illustration added--like a condiment--to a large text, these are appropriately lightweight and amusing, but as large pictures they don't compare to the more creative and funnier efforts here.  After a while, the similarities begin to inoculate you against the humor. A better format might have been to present these in the size in which they originally appeared.  However, this would make a good gift for baseball fans and those who live with them.  Overall, it's an excellent coffee table book that doesn't take up the whole coffee table.	2003-11-07

It's might be useful as an initial explanation, but it doesn't  (nor does it intend to) offer much more insight or coping strategies than those mentioned above.  As usual, the drawings are fairly bland and unimaginative, but will be familiar to the Berenstain Bear fan.	2003-10-23

The only real violence is the stabbing (without blood) of the monster. The intruder, on the other hand, gets bumped into a river when he aims his bow and arrow at some geese!<br />There are no words (watercolorist Goodall wrote more than 35 such books), but the fairy-tale setting, the beautiful illustrations, and the foldaway half pages that reveal action when peeled back will stimulate the young &quot;reader.&quot; For very small fry, somewhat older readers, especially girls, may not relate to the female mouse always being scared, and the male mouse always coming to her rescue.  But then, while the book is innovative in the use of foldaway half pages, the story is  fairly traditional.  In general, this is a very fun book that promises lots of good quality talk between you and your young one!	2003-10-23

Morales' tableaux display swirling designs, bold colors, and expressive faces to portray the joys and struggles described in Kathleen Krull's narrative.  It's not a preachy book, but relies instead on short revealing statements of  fact: \\"Once, after Cesar broke the rule about speaking English at all times, a teacher hung a sign on him that read, I AM A CLOWN. I SPEAK SPANISH.\\"<br />The book describes the inhumane treatment of the farm workers, focusing on Chavez' own experience: \\"Anyone who complained was fired, beaten up, or sometimes even murdered.\\"  Some may complain that this represents a monolithic view of ALL landowners in California. Still, this is a children's book, not a history of agricultural employment in California. The author correctly points out the terrible conditions that Chavez battled through non-violence,  notably the 1965 grape strike which ended with Chavez signing  the first farmworker contract in American history.  The book ends with a 2-page \\"author's note\\" that summarizes what Chavez accomplished.  I look forward to more of Morales' work.	2003-10-22

Her misadventures in Paris, prove challenging to those around her,and amusing to the reader. It's a collage of seemimgly misplaced dialogue and eccentric characters, yet is easy to read and laugh with.<br />(Note: Queneau is, I think, an underappreciated genius. You can find out more about him by looking up the book &quot;The OULIPO COMPENDIUM&quot; here at Amazon, which contains his extraordinary &quot;One-hundred-trillion sonnets.&quot; &quot;Oulipans: rats who build the labyrinth from which they plan to escape&quot; -- Raymond Queneau).<br />Zazie is less of a labyrinth and more of a amusement park, a good introduction to this imaginative writer.

The type and level of humor in this very funny book is shown in the first four pages: 1. &quot;Early one morning, the Bumb Bunnies were spending some quality time apart (picture of house)&quot;.  2. &quot;Poppa Bunny was watching the Super Bowl (bunny with football helmet eating popcorn and watching BOWLING on TV).&quot; 3. &quot;Momma Bunny was watching the Orange Bowl (bunny watching a bowl of oranges while spilling a bag of &quot;MOMCORN&quot;).&quot; 4. &quot;...and Baby Bunny was watching the Toilet Bowl... (bunny cheering a toilet).&quot;  If this is offensive, you may not want to buy the book. However, for those who like a silly, well-constructed, and colorfully illustrated tale, this is a winner.<br />The rest of the plot revolves loosely around various trips to the beach, the movies, etc., and is propelled by abundant puns and sight gags (most of which are NOT based on toilet humor). I found it genuinely funny, and an improvement on &quot;The Dumb Bunnies Go to the Zoo&quot;; here the bunnies seem somehow more endearing.  The gags are funnier and, sometimes, even sophisticated!<br />As usual, Dav Pilkey's illustrations are zanily bright and colorful without overwhelming the eyes. I tried to find out the media he used, only to find them listed as &quot;watercolors, India ink, acrylics, gouache, skim milk, and Vick's Vap-O-Rub!&quot; A very entertaining book for any young reader who enjoys the silly, especially those old enough to get the verbal and visual puns. Pilkey's &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; books deliver even more imaginative &quot;bathroom&quot; type humor, but at a higher reading level.	2003-09-10

This is one of the most beautifully written novels of the past 20 or more years, and definitely one of my personal favorites.  Arthur Golden, a student of Japanese art and language, paints a remarkably true-sounding account of one woman's training and practice as a geisha.  There's not a false note in the writing: The characters, dialogue, and emotional content all ring true. Aside from some slightly plodding descriptions of the protagonist's introduction to the geisha district of Gion, the pacing is excellent.<br />  I kept waiting for Golden to slip, for some implausibility in character or plot development, some anachronism or \\"artistic license\\" that would have made me feel cheated-but it never happened.  Without further research, it's difficult for me to comment on the book's historical and cultural accuracy, but it always felt true, and Golden's simple but powerful language is absolutely compelling.  The book surpassed my already high expectations, and increased my appreciation of--and curiousity about--historical Japanese social structure in general, and geisha culture in particular.  Above all, this is a completely satisfying book about perseverance within boundaries. Both the story and the writing are filled with grace, power, and beauty.	2003-05-09

Unfortunately, this means that while \\"Heartbreaker\\" is far better than his 1990 debut novel, it is far worse than 2001's Flinch. Ferrigno once again depicts the low-lifes of Orange County, California, and features the usual noirish cast: a protagonist with his own \\"moral code,\\" a femme fatale, a rich stepmother, a spoiled pretty boy playboy, and a hired thug.<br />Heartbreaker is a more deeply layered story than previous efforts, and he cleverly melds two main subplots centered in drug-obsessed Florida and in glitzy/seamy Orange County.  For the most part, the writing is brisk and humorous, and Ferrigno does breezy dialogue and tense situations very well.  (Theres also the usual graphic violence that may turn some readers off.)<br />However, the storys implausible twists and betrayals made this a disappointing read.  Why would someone trying to lay low appear on a drug-dealing killers favorite TV show and taunt him, thus making it easy to track him?  Theres an unappealing victim who is portrayed as an admirable person, and an appealing person who abruptly changes towards the very end of the story.  While these catch you by surprise, they seem contrived, especially in the latter example.  Flinch is a much better book, although populated with similar characters and action, you dont feel so manipulated.	2003-04-23

Unlike \\"Flinch,\\" the plot is sometimes unclear, he relies on clumsy stereotypes, and motivation is not always believable.<br />Ferrigno throws in so many contrived oddball situations that it's almost like he doesn't really believe in the strength of the story itself.  While humorous exaggeration is common to mysteries, Ferrigno doesn't balance this with enough realism to make this a credible story, and this lessens our involvement.<br />There are some good scenes (especially with the jocular but intimidating \\"Cubanito\\"), clever dialogue, and genuine suspense (along with his usual graphic violence), but the book does not compare to his later efforts.  Recommended only for completists who want to read all of his work.	2003-04-15

Although writer Jimmy Gage has the requisite cynicism and a balance of fair play and tough defiance, he's not strictly out of the Sam Spade mode either:  His sense of moral outrage is a bit askew, and he doesn't always use the best of judgment.

This book--at times disjointed, rambling, self-referential, and irreverent--is decades ahead of its time. It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease.  Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.<br />The book's structure is also modern:  He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route.  Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining. Twain seems caught between admiration and disdain for the \\"modern\\" age-but he also rejects over-sentimentality over the past. He writes with beauty and cynicism, verve and humor.  Very highly recommended!	2003-04-14

Calliope (later Cal) is the omniscient narrator of a story that begins in 1922 Smyrna, Asia Minor and ends almost 80 years later in Berlin.  Most of the story takes place in Detroit, a city that he describes with great insight and emotion.  Eugenides expertly switches between the voices of the grown-up Cal and the young Calliope; therefore, we experience events as Calliope did, but with the perspective of Cal (at age 40). Calliope is a winning storyteller, observant, funny, and with realistic childhood and adolescent feelings. Throughout the book, Eugenides demonstrates that Callie's circumstances underlie experiences shared by all: Pain, love, confusion, feelings of being both the same as and different from.  I think Eugenides somewhat underestimates the emotional toll that Callie's journey would entail, particularly during her long separation from her family as she makes the psychological transformation from Calliope to Cal. Usually; however, the insights and feelings are so true that it reads like an autobiography.<br />While the story is compelling, there are some problems that interfere with a fluid read. At times, narrative transitions are handled awkwardly through either through over use of ellipses (...) or with somewhat clunky sentences: 'Milton stepped on the gas, ignoring the scarcity not only of petroleum but of many other things as well,' which breaks into a long list of scarce hope, food, phone calls, clean socks, etc. He also overplays his hand at the Greek tragic motif he is constructing ('Sing now, O Muse, of the recessive mutation'!'; though he later, in apparent contradiction, concludes that we can forge our own truer identities) and in his broad caricatures of ethnic and religious types. There's also a sly quality that sets up \\"surprise\\" situations: In the most egregious case of 'magical realism,' or just plain gimmickry, Eugenides uses the conceit of using his fictional character 'Jimmy Zizmo' as the 'real' identity of the actual character, Nation of Islam Muslim founder W.D. Farr, and the denouement concerning Calliope's father and uncle lacks credibility.  Mostly though, Eugenides' story is compelling and humorous, and he masterfully evokes place and character (industrial Detroit; a hilarious indictment of an ultra-hip 1970s-era surgeon/sexologist), with a casual ease that nicely belies the serious themes.<br />The book bears some resemblance to Michael Chabon's own Pulitzer Prize winner, \\"The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.\\" In both, the immigrant experience and the forging of a new identity are central, characters journey to find their own \\"American dream,\\" and urban settings help shape their lives. While Chabon is the more nimble phrase writer, Eugenides is similarly poignant and symbolic.  Like Chabon, Eugenides uses metaphor (based on reality) as he explores the ideas of being 'different,' the sometimes-artificial nature of boundaries, and the Greek notion of fate. It is an entertaining and often moving story that, despite some minor annoyances, I recommend very highly.mmickry, Eugenides uses the conceit of using his fictional character 'Jimmy Zizmo' as the 'real' identity of the actual character, Nation of Islam Muslim founder W.D.

Leroy \\"Encyclopedia\\" Brown, a winning fifth-grader, uses his powers of observation and logic to solve petty crimes and assorted other mysteries in his neighborhood.  Aided in some stories by tough, bright Sally Kimball (look out, she hits!), Encyclopedia solves 10 cases here.  The stories are formatted similarly:  There's a problem (e.g., something is stolen, someone makes a possibly false statement), and Sobel mixes in a few good clues with a lot of dialogue and extraneous information.  Brown announces that he has solved the case, and the reader is asked to come up with Brown's solution.  Answers are given in the back.<br />Unlike some books in the series, all but two or three of the stories were solvable without special knowledge or assumptions.  Our third-grader, who's quite the intellect himself, said that a few of these mini-mysteries were very hard; some of these stories are more appropriate for kids in upper elementary school grades.  Each story is about 5-6 pages long; the solutions are about 1 page.  The dialogue doesn't always sound very contemporary, at least not for those living in urban California.  Close attention to detail will help the young Holmes in your house.	2003-03-01

However, when young Emma Tuttle finds her ideal pet, a beautiful green parakeet named \\"Henry,\\", the author indulges in some fun, fanciful adventures.

I'd have to agree with their parents.\\"<br />Dav Pilky's affectionate, \\"epic novel\\" further chronicles the adventures of George and Harold and their principal, Mr. Krupp, who turns into heroic \\"Captain Underpants\\" whenever someone snaps their fingers. Pilky unapologetically presents toilet jokes, body part jokes (the boys switch a sign from \\"pretty armchairs\\" to \\"hairy armpits\\"), and brazen disobedience at school. That's a warnng to potential buyers who can't stand this kind of juvenile humor.<br />But the book is for juveniles (and those in touch with their inner juvenile).  Pilkey's silly jokes, gimmicks (FLIP-O-RAMA), and self-referential chapter titles are inspired insipid fun, and not nearly as violent as the Three Stooges.  More mature children will appreciate Pilkey's skewering of the traditional kids' book  and his celebration of low-tech, non-glossy gimmickry.<br />Oh, and not that it matters, but the evil Talking Toilets are defeated by the \\"Photo-Atomic Trans-Somgobulating Yectofantriplutonic-zanziptomiser\\" (or PANSY). 139 pages of fun and lowbrow humor.

Illustrations are by Michel Simeon.)<br />This fanciful book's old-fashioned style and content almost feels as if it were written at the turn of the 19th Century, and the James' initial misery recalls Dickens. The writing's rough edges make it seem more like a personal story, rather than the product of some anonymous conglomerate.<br />Unfortunately, the beginning of the book (where James magically escapes from his aunts) seems contrived, the aunts are unbelievably cruel, and the writing is somehow flat.  However, the book picks up after James and his newfound insect friends escape via a magic peach.  The bantering and arguing insect personalities are reminiscent of those in \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" (The feuding Centipede and Worm are a bit like emotionally labile Tigger and pessimistic Eeyore; the \\"LadyBird\\" plays a role similar to the Scarecrow.) The insects' squabbling and fear is balanced by James' good-hearted and well-reasoned actions that save them from sharks, the angry  \\"Cloud People\\" (who throw hail, water, and rainbow-making paint at them), and the fearful citizens of New York City.<br />Dahl has lots of word play (\\"Oh, just look at the vermicious gruesome face!\\"), and songs done in a kind of  \\"Alice of Wonderland\\" meets Broadway style: \\"I've eaten many strange and scrumptious dishes in my time, Like jellied gnats and dandyprats and earwigs cooked in slime, And mice with rice-they're really nice/When roasted in their prime. (But don't forget to sprinkle them with just a pinch of grime.)\\"  As you can see, the humor (and some of Michel Simeon's illustrations for the 1988 edition) is sometimes fun-gothic, and the demise of the aunts is not like that pictured in the movie based on the book (They get run over by the peach.)  Overall, however, and despite its slow beginning, the book is stylish and lots of fun.	2003-02-20

In \\"Fox and the Girls,\\" Fox goes to a fair with Rose, then Lola (\\"On Wednesday Fox and Lola went to the fair.\\"), and finally Raisin, who discovers Fox's previous \\"dates\\"  (\\"And on Saturday, Fox went to the fair...all alone.\\"). In the final story, Fox and his sister win second prize in a dance contest (\\"They did the boogie. They did the stomp.\\"), after Raisin turns him down--perhaps still upset about Fox's fair dates described in the previous story.  While the first two stories have some clever humor, the final one is a bit flat.  The pictures, while simple and cute (somewhat similar to Sandra Boynton's style), are chiefly limited to green and orange colors.  A good book for Fox fans, but I can't imagine most children getting too excited over the stories.  However, children may enjoy a  \\"chapter book\\" geared for the early reader (perhaps grades 1-2).  The publisher (Dial) lists the reading level as 1.8; the book is one of several in its the \\"Easy-to-Read&quot; collection.	2003-02-20

This systematic approach is a great way to compare and contrast the clothes, climate, flora, and activities of the seasons, yet it is never boring or repetitive:  Anne Rockwell's pictures switch from wide angle to close up perspectives and this adds an unexpected twist.  A very satisfying book with warm, bright, colorful, illustrations, and lots of details to explore.	2003-02-20

He's a little more like Mr. Toad, doing some things he knows he shouldn't do, and he's not always very careful. Still, his exuberance and the winning 1950's illustrations are a delight. As usual, George gets into trouble with people, but eventually he rescues one of the circus animals and is hailed as a hero.<br /><br />It's true that George gets into an circus wagon with two strangers... Be sure to advise your own little monkey not to take rides with strangers. But if that upsets you, you might as well also explain that circuses are often not very animal-friendly.  A little too long compared with the simple joys of other George books, but this does extend the curious monkey's adventures to somewhat older kids.  Lots of action in the 48 pages, with no more than one to three short paragraphs of text per page.	2003-01-31

This is a fairly interesting book about a sleepover at a friend's and the ways they alternately laugh and get a little scared about the possibilities of ghosts in the house.  The author convincingly portrays two friends playing: They joke, eat spaghetti, tell stories, and play with their pets.  On a dark and stormy night (what else?) the boys are awakened by unusual sounds from the piano downstairs; (DON'T read the following if you want a surprise!) it's the two hamsters eating crumbs off the piano!  48 pages with nice (but not exceptional) color pictures. Although the publisher calls this an \\"easy-to-read mystery,\\" I don't think it's for kids just beginning to read; some reading experience will help.	2003-01-31

The story, based on a legend of the Northwest Indians (it would have been nice to name them), is about diverse animals working together to save salmon from a river-going whale!  Thunderbird's talons take the whale up to a mountaintop and the two creatures strike a deal to make the river safer for Frog and  abundant with fish for people.<br />In addition to the unique wood prints, Siberell's book is noteworthy for the last page's description of tools and natural color sources (e.g., cedar, animal blood, berries, clamshells) used to make totem poles.  29 pages, suitable for reading to toddlers up through first grade or so, as well as a good reading book for the somewhat older child (around second or third grade).	2003-01-30

A Treasure of Pirate Information	Once again, Dorling Kindersley swabs the decks of other publishing houses with its high quality production, style, and storehouse of sidebars, illustrations, and tidbits of information.  This book is recommended for children in grades 2-4, although they caution that these are rough guidelines.<br />After a brief introduction, there are fictional first-person narratives of adventures with famous pirates from many places and eras, including a slave of Julius Caesar, both of whom are captured by pirates (and eventually freed); Henry \\"Long Ben\\" Avery, a British pirate of the late 17th century, Henry Morgan's pillaging, looting, and torture in Jamaica, the exploits of Captain Kidd and Blackbeard.<br />Along with illustrations of such pirate essentials as guns and swords, ships and navigational instruments, food and flags, there is a drawing of a gallows and a man hanging from one, a man placed on the torture instrument, \\"the rack,\\" several pictures illustrating a hangman's noose, a hanging body and a severed head tied to a ship. These pictures are not graphic or detailed, but they may  be frightening to some children.  48 pages, with a brief glossary, and lots of pictures. The historical angle would have been more complete if an afterward had been written to explain the demise of the piracy.	2003-01-29

His floating word-pictures are both vague and precise, inviting the reader's imagination to fill in the blanks.  Thomas creates the sensations of memory--blurred, idiosyncratic, and suffused with impression:<br />\\"There were church bells, too\\"<br />\\"Inside them?\\"<br />\\"No, no, no, in the bat-black, snow-white belfries, tugged by bishops and storks. And they rang their tidings over the bandaged town, over the frozen foam of the powder and ice-cream hills, over the crackling sea.\\"<br />Fortunately, the dreamlike imagery never weighs down the book. Instead, Thomas wishes only to convey the warmth, humor, and imagination of his childhood Christmases in Wales. Although this is great modernist literature, it is completely unpretentious and can be enjoyed by all ages.  The book seems longer than it is, perhaps because Thomas' depictions linger warmly after one reads about the Christmas fire, the smoking Uncles and drinking aunts, the presents (\\"...and a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unducklike sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow\\"), the dinner, the caroling at the large strange house where \\"the wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant and maybe webfooted men in caves,\\" the music, and the soft bedtime.<br />These episodes are generally no longer than a page each, but they graft onto our own memories--or would-be memories--of what Christmas could or should be like.  In sum, it's a pleasure for the both the intellect and the senses, an unsentimental yet warm treat for both young and older audiences. It's one of the truest--and therefore most satisfying--Christmas books you'll ever read.	2003-01-07

For the most part, it succeeds both as literary experiment and as narrative.  Author James Merrill is a poet, and his imagery and poetic structure are the major attraction of this \\"book within a book.\\"<br />Merrill's protagonist, Sandy, struggles with a novel he's writing about his family and their experiences on the Greek island of \\"Diblos.\\"  Merrill's conceit is that his (Merrill's) book is really the notebook of author \\"Sandy.\\"  There are two types of entries in this notebook: Sandy's draft of a novel, complete with edits, restarts, notes to himself, etc., and Sandy's journal about his \\"real life\\" and people and experiences from which he derives much of his novel.<br />I won't be giving away too much by providing a brief key to the names of characters in Sandy's novel and their counterparts Sandy's life. \\"Orestes\\" is the draft novel 's name for Orson, Sandy's half-brother. \\"Dora\\" (the older woman unnamed at the start of Sandy's novel), Orestes' friend and lover, is based on Dora, friend and lover of Orson on Diblos who later accompanies him to New York City. \\"Sandy\\" remains unnamed in the novel, but is Orestes' half-brother.  \\"Arthur Orson\\" is Orson's godfather; his place in the novel is not yet resolved.<br />\\"The (Diblos) Notebook\\" is not as confusing as it may sound, and the writing is evocative and beautifully impressionistic:  \\"The islands of Greece  Across vivid water the islands of Greece lie. They have been cut out of cardboard and set on bases of  at subtle odds with one another, upon bases of pale haze. Their colors are mauve, exhausted blue, tanned rose, here and there crinkled to catch the light. They do not seem  It is inconceivable that they are of one substance with the warm red rock underfoot\\"<br />These fits and starts are especially prevalent in the beginning of Merrill's book, and (as he notes in his 1994 afterword) are his attempt to show that, contrary to the notions of some Beat writers, the first creative impulse is not always the best. Sometimes revision improves writing.  What I found just as interesting, though, were the sentences in which the original sounded truer, as if the revisions were trying to hide certain emotions.  The editing device, with the fragments that resemble poetry and the hints at repression get somewhat tiring after awhile, and Merrill focuses more on straightforward narrative in the well-paced second half.  His presentations of brilliant, vain Orson, insightful but isolated Sandy, and the contrasts between Greece and New York read easily and are as insightful as the more overtly psychological revisions.  It's an interesting book, rich with such pleasures.  At times the book is challenging, and Merrill perhaps overplays his  \\"experiment,\\" but it's also one of those books that reveals more pleasures with each rereading (whether of the whole book or just sections). This book was well received by the critics; it was a final nominee for the National Book Award in Fiction in 1965. Definitely recommended.attempt to show that, contrary to the notions of some Beat writers, the first creative impulse is not always the best. Sometimes revision improves writing.

Part of the fun is the unexpected leap from he has now to what he wants next.  As our third-grader put it, it wouldn't be that funny if the book just said, \\"If you take a mouse to the movies, he'll want to see the movie.\\"<br />On the other hand, I understand those readers who say this is not quite as good as others in the series, notably, \\"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.\\"  Some of the if/then conjunctions just aren't as clever as in the past.  Moreover, the title sets up some false expectations that the mouse's appetites will take place within a movie theatre, or, at least, within an urban setting.  Instead, almost the whole book involves requests for holiday items, most of which are found in the house.  Perhaps if the book (and the title) pointed to the book's Christmas theme, one's expectations would be met and the book would satisfy more than it does.<br />Still, I think any child will enjoy this book, and the warm, humorous (cute, frankly!) pictures by the imaginative Felicia Bond.  The illustrations are interesting without being cluttered, colorful without being assaultive.  Just the thing for a fun holiday read!	2002-12-09
1312089:US	49600435	R2WAZUJ993JQH5	0743427041	720671224	The Secret Life of Dr. Demented	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Good for Right Audience	Although the title focuses on wrestler Dr. Demented, a scary \\"heel\\" (bad guy) who demolished his opponents with power and brutality, this is primarily an issue book, exploring such themes as divorce and single parenting, dating, violence and bullies, and being true to oneself.  As such, it was somewhat boring to my third grader but will probably appeal to young adolescents around 5th to 7th grade or so.<br />Wrestling fan Wesley discovers that the feared and idolized \\"Dr. Demented,\\" is really his gym teacher, Landon Wheeler, in disguise.  He and a friend begin weight training with Dr. Demented so that the school bully will stop picking on them.  Wesley's mom, who suffered through after an abusive relationship with her ex-husband, tries to raise her son to rely on his brains and not his body. However, she meets the cultured, strong but gentle Mr. Wheeler, and they begin to date.  Soon, each person is struggling with a dilemma:  Should Wesley tell his mom the truth about Dr. Demented's identity?  Should Wesley's mom see Landon anymore after his secret identity is revealed?  How should Wes and his friend deal with the bully?  Should Dr. Demented continue his secret (and, maybe even \\"job\\" a fight--lose on purpose) so that he can get enough money for medical school, or should he be honest with himself and with Wesley's mom?<br />There are just too many complex problems to resolve, and Gutman sometimes straddles both sides of an issue.  He points out that wrestling is fake, but also that wrestlers do get injured and sometimes hurt themselves intentionally for the sake of the show. Violent self-defense is \\"sticking up for a friend\\" and may avert future attacks, yet could also have seriously injured the school bully. Honesty and sincerity are important, but the gym teacher's obsessive attentions and later apologies seem to come from a man who view a date as a conquest to be won like a wrestling match.  At least, Gutman comes out unequivocally against using substances to enhance weight training.<br />This book might be best in a classroom, where a teacher could point out the contrasts, and let kids debate the various angles that Gutman presents.  Otherwise, I recommend this to older students who are mature enough to both enjoy and think through these dilemmas, either by themselves or with family members.  There is some intriguing information about how wrestling is choreographed, and Gutman's ear for kids' dialogue is keen as usual.  However, I don't think this somewhat overly ambitious book is as good as those in his sports time traveling series (e.g., \\"Jackie Robinson and Me\\").  Still, it's an interesting \\"serious\\" exploration of a very popular phenomenon.nhance weight training.<br />This book might be best in a classroom, where a teacher could point out the contrasts, and let kids debate the various angles that Gutman presents.

The book does not back away from the ugly words, the prejudice, or the violence faced by many Black Americans at that time, especially by the courageous Robinson.<br />As usual, Gutman explores the social and historical context (I would have enjoyed even more details about Brooklyn; Gutman references three books for further reading), and he supplants the text with photos, newspaper reproductions, stats, and a note to the reader separating the book's facts from fiction.  The book is well-researched, although there are some anti-Robinson quotes from players and other racist material that I wish Gutman had explicitly documented:  It's not that I doubt that they happened, but a direct cite to source material would enable the reader to know if the words and behaviors are described verbatim or are there as (approximate) illustrations of what Robinson faced. Gutman wisely notes in his \\"To the Reader\\" that \\"Robinson's first year in the big leagues was even more difficult than described here.\\"  Another fine job by Gutman; I recommend this highly to mature young readers who can handle and/or talk about the ugly and violent racism described here.	2002-12-04

This is one of the best in the Joe Stoshack series, the boy who travels in time to meet some of baseball's legends.  Gutman excels at evoking baseball's early years, when the game was more intimate and perhaps rougher. Gutman really did his research: \\"People were hanging all over the fence, and there were seats in front [italics] of the fence. The only thing keeping fans away from the playing field was a rope.\\" Gutman also includes some play by play descriptions from the 1909 Series.<br />Gutman supplements these descriptions with newspaper clipings, great photos (including one of Wagner and Cobb, and what I assume is the Detroit field, \\"Bennett Park,\\" in 1909), a reproduction of the T-206 Wagner, stats, a 2-page baseball \\"tips\\" piece written by Wagner in 1950, and a short section that separates the book's facts from fiction.<br />There's a minor romantic subplot that seemed a bit contrived, but it's incidental to the main action here. Wagner comes off as an admirable man with a wonderful sense of humor, and Gutman, as usual, shares with us his great affection for the game.	2002-12-04

Book for the Musically Inclined	Yes, the man is opinionated, and one may argue with some of his more controversial and unsparing critiques.  His analyses are grounded in a thorough understanding of music, and he does not retreat from criticizing the most popular. I think that the whole topic is perhaps more subjective than Wilder lets on, but at least he's forthright about his opinions, and provides hundreds of musical annotations to illustrate his views. I'll also agree with the reviewer who criticizes Wilder's view that post-50's popular music was written by &quot;amateurs.&quot; Still, this is widely regarded as a must-have for the student of popular music, and it's an excellent, albeit somewhat technical critique of popular music's &quot;golden age.&quot;  Recommended!	2002-12-04

There is little or no mention of cost analyses  (a popular topic these days), or of epidemiology or case-mix adjustment. The book probably best for the intermediate user who wants SAS programming instruction than for the advanced user testing hypotheses.<br />Still, the book includes several topics that are endemic to the health care field, including an explanation of diagnostic, procedure, and national drug codes, and brief overviews of some of the major health care databases  (e.g., HCFA, UB92).  There is a very good appendix listing database and health information organizations on the net, such as the National Health Information Resource Center, the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (which includes some programs), although VA sites are not listed.<br />In general, there are several gaps in the book, perhaps not unexpected given its relatively brief length (274 pages). There's an excellent glossary, although, annoyingly, some of the terms are not discussed in the text itself (e.g., RUG).  Some complicated procedures are admirably described (Proc SQL); others are mentioned with very little explanation (ARRAY).  The authors are aware that of the space limitations, and helpfully list other books in the SAS-published  \\"Books By Users\\" series (including the excellent SAS books by Ron Cody). This book is best viewed as an introduction and overview of the subject.	2002-11-20

Because the brain regulates the entire body, the author spends an inordinate  (and misleading, from the title) amount of time on topics other than the brain; for example, the different types of teeth, and the layers of the skin.  For this reason, a lot of fascinating brain-related information is omitted.<br />The author is also a bit too glib, and this gives a very mixed tone of the serious and the off cuff:  \\"the two are brought together by sexual intercourse (a term often shortened to `sex' when people are in a hurry\\").  Moreover, admonishments to care for your body (brush your teeth, exercise more, etc.) seemed out of place.  On the positive side, the book has some fun illustrations (although a too cluttered at times), and the large color pictures of the organs and brain are fairly easy to understand.  62 pages, with a short glossary and an index.	2002-11-20

Henry is worried: \\"He thought Mudge might drool on the teacher's foot.  Or sit on a poodle by mistake. Or not even stay awake long enough to do anything.\\"<br />The book is funny and teaches kids some fundamentals about training dogs.  If Mudge can do it, maybe your dog can do it too!<br />The book is rated at \\"level 2--reading with help\\" by the publisher, and it has enough repetition and short sentences for the beginning reader.

Fisher (later a famed chef and memoirist) and her husband Al Fisher lived and studied in Dijon, France.

The brief book (about 30 pages) traces his power hitting from his youth to high school and to college at USC, then picks up his home run stats at Oakland and St. Louis.  There are excellent color photos throughout.  Somehow, the book doesn't quite capture the magnitude or excitement of his achievement (later broken by Barry Bonds), and a page devoted to his full stats would have been helpful. But the book does mention some of the more subtle reasons why that year was special, such as the competition with Sammy Sosa, and the respect McGwire showed to the family of Roger Maris.  McGwire also established a foundation to help abused children, and is presented as a good role model for kids.  Enjoyable reading, with great pictures, this would be appreciated by a young baseball fan.	2002-11-15

However, because it focuses on developing basketball skills, there are few of the archival photos, sidebars, and memorabilia that DK usually presents.  Basketball history is limited, and there are very few shots of NBA players.<br />Instead the book gives a thorough presentation of fundamental basketball skills, including dribbling, several types of passing and shooting, defense, and some plays such as the fast break, the give and go, and the screen play.  Young models illustrate these basics and the presentation is very clear. Again, however, this is a book for beginning players, those with some experience playing on a supervised team will probably not benefit that much from this material.	2002-11-15

Dr. Feinberg describes a political scandal as anything in a public officials professional or personal life that defies the code of conduct Americans set for themselves. She astutely notes that since morals change, so may the behavior thought sufficient to reach scandal status. She excludes scandals that do not involve political or personal morality (although many early scandals such as the Peggy Eaton Affair seem to fall outside this scope), and does not discuss unverified accusations.  Thus, she mentions (in Chapter 1) that there is no mention of the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings or the charge that the release of hostages in Iraq was timed to influence the 1980 election.<br />For the most part, the book focuses on egregious and important scandals, along with a few of the more vivid episodes (e.g., the beating of Senator Sumner in the Senate Chamber, and the Hamilton/Burr duel) to keep things interesting.  Dr. Feinberg categorizes the many scandals into Violent Political Quarrels, Controversial Election Returns,  Affairs of the Heart, Political Office for Personal Profit, Public Displays of Personal Misconduct, and Abuse of Power. Unfortunately, the book predates the impeachment of Clinton, and the 2002 election irregularities, although there is an excellent section on the abuses of Iran-Contra (although the defense position is not discussed).  She wisely concludes, although the government is not scandal proof, it is not permanently scandal-ridden, and she reminds readers of the governmental and journalistic checks against scandal.  Although limited by its brevity, Dr. Feinberg presents three theories about the prevalence of scandal in the Grant, Harding, Nixon, and Reagan eras.  Teachers and students will be pleased with the books bibliography, glossary, six pages of source notes, timeline, and index.pleased with the books bibliography, glossary, six pages of source notes, timeline, and index.	2002-11-11

Books	4	1	1	N	N	4 1/2*  Going Dental	This book turns the potentially mundane topic of animal teeth into a fascinating one. Patricia Lauber goes beyond the expected description of incisor, canine, and molar functions by presenting lots of details and interesting facts.  For example, felines have sharper teeth than canines because most big cats (e.g., lions) pounce on rather than chase after prey. Elephants, walruses, and hippos use their tusks to dig, to get around, for defense, and for hunting.  The writing is clear and informal: &#147;Perhaps you are wondering how an animal with such big teeth can close its mouth. The answer is that there are two pockets in the upper jaw. When a hippos closes its mouth, the lower canines fit into these pockets.&#148;<br />Lauber tells how animals can be classified by their teeth, and describes a variety of animals, including bats, dinosaurs, sea mammals, fish, and reptiles. The book is aimed primarily at elementary school readers, although older children will find much of the material enjoyable and interesting. There are 60 pages, with black and white illustrations and an index.	2002-11-11

Even Sports Illustrated sends out a writer for a major feature about her. But what her the emotionally suppressed father, and Ruthie herself discover is the pain, longing, and isolation hidden behind her dazzling on-field brilliance.<br /><br />Ruth is the only girl on her team and in her family, her pioneering firefighter mother having been killed several years before.  Her future in baseball is doubtful because of her gender, and her family doesn't recognize her claims to grief and her desires to remember her mother. With the help of the sportswriter, her feminist friend Ellie, and, especially, her own courage in confronting her family, she discovers her true, multifaceted identity.  The pride and confidence she feels on the field are, at the story's conclusion, extended to her feelings about herself.  I recommend this to older kids because of the mature themes:  Baseball is really just a subtext for this psychological portrayal of a young woman.  Yet, it's both serious and fun at the same time. This winner of the Marguerite De Angeli Prize (for a first novel aimed at middle-grade readers) is a well-written story of some of the pains and joys of growing up. Recommended.	2002-11-08

There are surprising facts: The father's instinct to balance an egg on his feet away from the snow is so strong, that \\"one emperor who doesn't have an egg shuffles around with a chunk of ice about the size of a softball.\\"  It's nice that both mother and father penguins get their due as hard-working parents. The mother must travel \\"waddle, waddle\\" ninety miles to the open sea (at less than one mile an hour) to get food after the egg is hatched. If lucky, she may find a \\"field of slick ice, and toboggan on her white belly to speed up the four-day trip. Swoosh! Swoosh!\\"  (The author has a lot of fun with verbs!).  The father stays with the egg for over two months in temperatures as low as -60 degrees F., and  loses half of his body weight.<br />Some passages are longer and more complex than others, although in some way this widens the book's appeal.  The pictures are boldly colorful and uncluttered  (made from hand painted paper shaped formed into collages), my only complaint is that some there are too many pages of static penguins. True, this is the frozen North, but in other sections of the book there is more detail and action.  Replete with interesting penguin facts and bright, friendly pictures, this is an excellent combination picture book/fact book.	2002-11-04

I thought he succeeded in this. The main problem is the lack of a plot: The myriad observations (divided into 54(!) short excerpts fail to advance a plot, although we do get deeper into Nory's head.  It just gets very tedious after awhile.<BR>I would recommend this as a book from which to read excerpts, but Baker would have been better to write a shorter book, or to have some semblance of a plot.

He may have also begun the modern media-related \\"show within a show\\" concept, exemplified to some extent by \\"Seinfeld,\\" and in the past by the shows of George Burns, Danny Thomas, and Lucy and Desi.  Perhaps it is more accurate to describe him as the father of post-modern comedy, where every occurrence, sound effect, and the idea of comedy itself is the object of Benny's gentle yet piercingly funny humor. But enough intellectualizing, above all perhaps, he was an extraordinarily talented, funny, and well-loved man.<br />Mr. Benny's daughter found this unfinished biographical material and we are grateful for the insights to his character, his humor (beginning with his days in vaudeville), and his wide-ranging, generally liberal thoughts on celebrity, comedy, and race.  These sections of the book justify its purchase and are the primary source of its enjoyment.<br />As others have noted, Joan's sections of the book can drag and one eagerly waits for the bolded font which is her father's own words.  I do think she provides some valuable insights into Mr. Benny's domestic life and routine, as well as some humorous and interesting glimpse into growing up as the daughter of one of our most popular and well-respected entertainers. Unfortunately, some of this seems fairly generic to that culture, especially her early years.  Her criticisms of her mother, however well founded, seem discordant with the prevailing tone of the book.  The book would have been better with more pruning of Joan's autobiographical comments.<br />Still, the other material is a treasure for his millions of fans, and I recommend the book to fans.  Joan's part does not detract from her father's; after all, the book was never finished and gives an incomplete picture anyway.  Mr. Benny seems a modest man and I believe his biographies would complement the wonderful material here.  If you're new to the subject, perhaps you should begin with the biographies and then proceed here, if you're a confirmed fan, the order won't matter, and you will want this in your collection.Benny seems a modest man and I believe his biographies would complement the wonderful material here.

There's even a mention of the mildly scary \\"heffalumps and woozles.\\"  All turns out well: \\"...I just remembered that no bear ever had such grand and wonderful friends.\\"  The book has 25 pages, with simple, uncluttered pictures on each page.	2002-10-10

Other authors have done this, but Eugene Trivizas is particularly clever and Helen Oxenburys drawings capture the personalities very well.  The role reversal is easy enough, but Trivizas adds layers of humor with his descriptions of the wolves and the pig. The three cuddly little wolves with soft and furry tales enjoy such genteel pursuits as croquet, battledore, and shuttlecock, and the big bad pig uses a sledgehammer, a pneumatic drill, and dynamite to destroy the very study houses.  Theres a wonderful paradoxical ending (the house made of flowers is the strongest), just one of the many creative twists and turns to the traditional story. Despite the pigs potent methods of destruction, no animals are hurt (except for some slightly scorched tales) in the book.	2002-10-10

Another very useful SAS book by one of the premier instructors in the field, Ron Cody.  These are challenging problems, probably most appropriate for the intermediate to intermediate-advanced SAS programmer.  You can really discover what you know about SAS by trying your hand at these well-conceived problems; as most SAS users know, the best way to learn is by doing.  The problems give you some experience (and answers) before you encounter potentially hoarier problems at work or home.  The answer book is limited to solutions, with little or no discussion of pitfalls, alternatives, or the logic behind the answers.  Therefore, if you do not immediately understand the solution, you will need to work backwards, pick it apart, or use some other technique (like asking someone).  This somewhat limits its audience to those who are more experienced. I hope either Cody or someone else will have a more instructive answer book in the future.  Still, at this time, with so few books like this available, this is a great way to test and expand your knowledge. (Although you may also wish to examine the shorter but cheaper \\"test\\" book by Robert Virgile, also available from Amazon.)<br />The four sections are \\"Data Step Programming,\\" \\"Procedures,\\" \\"SAS Programming Techniques,\\" and \\"Statistics Problems.\\" Each of these sections has several brief topics; for example, Data Step Programming includes combining data sets, using IF-THEN/ELSE and other logical operators, numerical functions, dates, arrays, and working with longitudinal data.<br />Why two separate books? Cody explains that the \\"solution is obvious once you see it\\" and \\"the learning potential of the book is lost.\\"  He therefore \\"removed the temptation for students to flip to the back of the book.\\" (Come now, aren't we more disciplined than that?).  A more persuasive argument is that \\"teachers may...feel more comfortable in assigning problems without the solutions too close at hand.

This work helped establish or influence Abstraction and the Avant-Garde, and drew upon Rousseau's realism, \\"primitives,\\" folklore, and other currents.  In sum, this \\"episode\\" was the foundation for much of modern art in the 20th century.<br />The book has 180 illustrations (160 in color), and they are sumptuous:  Vibrant, textured, full of movement and bold color.  Printed on thick luminous paper, this is an opulent book.  However, unlike some so-called \\"coffee-table\\" books, the scope is manageable, and the text reads intelligently and without hyperbole. Kandinsky is especially well represented here (showing a variety of his styles), and there is an interesting section on his interests in theater and music. Unfortunately, there is no index, and the text could have been longer, but this is an absolutely beautiful collection of paintings.  The book has 223 pages, with photo credits that identify the location of the paintings. Very highly recommended.	2002-10-07

This excerpt describes the bears' practice field:<br />\\"There were no foul lines, just base paths worn by year after year of cubs running the bases.  So there were a lot of arguments about foul balls.  There was a rule against sliding into second base, because second base was a rock.

His goal is to see whether Ruth really did \\"call his shot,\\" that is, point to the outfield stands just prior to hitting a home run there.  Joe's angry, divorced, recently laid-off father sees the trip as a money-making opportunity (by betting on know outcomes, accruing 70 years of interest, and obtaining Ruth-autographed baseballs to sell when they return to the present).<br />This well-written book will appeal to all baseball fans, especially its audience of kids around 7 to 12 years.  Gutman obviously loves the game and its lore, and he vividly recreates 1932 Chicago. It's a very good history as well as sports book, as Gutman describes (aided by newspaper clippings and photos) such topics as segregation, the Depression, and the arrival of German Fascism.  At times, Gutman is a little too sentimental, especially when describing the eventual (and predictable) family rapprochement, and there's a somewhat simplistic nod to the Holocaust.<br />The main appeal is its depiction of early baseball and the larger-than-life character of the Babe.<br />Although Gutman exaggerates some of Ruth's grandiosity (which the author points out in an afterward), most of the book is factual.  Gutman's researched his subject with sources such as the Society for American Baseball Research and the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Baseball Center.  There's also a terrific section featuring contemporaries' opinions on the called shot, and a 2-page summary of Ruth's batting and pitching stats. These are inspired ideas, that, again, show Gutman's skillful weaving of fiction and fact.<br />This book offers much more than the usual sports fiction for kids.

This book transports you to 1602 London and its  famous Globe theater, the venue for some of Shakespeare's greatest plays. One of its many strengths is that it is told in first person narrative by multiple characters: A young male character actor playing a woman as well as Richard Burbage, perhaps the most famous Shakespearian actor of the time, an apple seller struggling to make a living during a time of plague, a wealthy theater-goer and a poor one, a pickpocket, and Burbage's brother, Cuthbert, the force being the building of the Globe.<br />The narratives and sidebars are full of interesting facts and\\" asides, from the major types of plays and play-goers (\\"people whose clothes were thought to be too expensive [for their station]...were arrested and fined.\\" There's an excellent section on Richard Burbage and his techniques, along with details on stage production, the history upon which Henry V was based, and the tricks that kept audiences spellbound.<br />Highlighting both the high and low culture/classes of the period, \\"Welcome to the Globe\\" gives a fresh and colorful presentation on a subject many school-age children might otherwise find distant and boring.  There's an intimacy to the narratives that complements the panoramic view of the broader culture in which the plays thrived.  The book may interest readers into further exploration not only of the theater, but of culture, history, and science. The scope and quality here yields yet another DK hit!	2002-09-23

But Bobby meets moose Harry Haller, the \\"Emperor of Cool\\" and copies his every move. \\"He ate cool, he slept cool, he walked cool, and he talked cool...\\" He becomes so cool, in fact, that one day he literally needs to thaw before he can move! Finally Bobby wins the acceptance he so eagerly sought..<br />After reaching the epitome of cool, Bobby discovers he no longer has to try being cool: \\"He already was cool. He'd been there. Right at the heart of it\\". Bobby seems to have discovered the zen of cool-- being cool is about authenticity and not playing to the crowd. But this moral conviction falters as author McEwan tries to have it both ways: At the contest for coolest skateboarder, Bobby both tries being cool and disdains it. Harry's sage advice that boundaries are sometimes needed tempers Bobby's free-wheeling but potentially dangerous freedom. (In a way, there's a mixed message, being cool means doing your own thing, but within limits imposed by a role model). Ultimately, the sage Harry whispers an understanding message about skateboarding and the art of achieving inner cool: \\"Many catch air. Only a few take flight.\\"<br />Perhaps this review finds too much of a message in the book. At the level with which most kids will read it, \\"The Heart of Cool\\" uses authentic language(e.g.\\"Okay, big man, your turn! Show us how Mr. Totally Cool does it.\\"). There's a believable spectrum of characters, and Sandra Boynton's ever magical mix of soft line, beautiful, unusual coloration, and nuanced portrayal of emotion.  48 pages, buoyed by Boynton's graceful illustrations and a \\"message\\" that may, at least in part, alleviate some of the dangers of peer pressure.	2002-09-23

But Moo, wanting more, and inspired by a book of heroes called \\"The Musk of Zorro,\\" persuades Minnie that they should and could be heroes.  They take their cues from a misread \\"Zorro\\" book (or a version written just for cows): \\"Who was `Zorro'?\\" Minnie asked. \\"A famous bull,\\" said Moo. \\"...he dressed in black and scared away the bad guys with a sword...he marked their shoots with the letter Z.\\"  \\"I'll bet that scared then,\\" said Minnie. [Get ready for punch line:] \\"That, and the smell, said Moo. The musk of Zorro put fear in their hearts.\\"<br />So, armed with salvaged costumes. A sword attached to lipstick (to the notorious \\"Z\\" on the bad guys), and some deodorant substituting for the musk of Zorro, our two bovine heroines courageously and mistakenly battle a chicken (they thought it was \\"a fox\\"), and some  pajamas hanging to dry (\\"bad guys\\"). While the ending is a little week, it conveys books' potential for imaginative adventure.  With 48 pages, colorful illustrations, and two loveable cows featured in other Dorling Kindersley books. Recommended by DK for grades 1-3, this is a very funny book.	2002-09-23

First, the young reader (or audience) may not initially realize that main characters  \\"Jane\\" and \\"Teddy\\" are the dolls of the titular \\"Lily\\" and \\"Willy.\\" Second, after several gentle scenes where Willy's Teddy copies whatever Lily does with \\"Jane\\" (\\"Jane wants to climb a tree. Teddy too.\\"), Teddy surprises us by not copying the nap that Lily gives Jane: (\\"Jane wants to take a nap.  Bear NO!\\")<br />It's a nice indirect take on the difficulties of naptime and the individuality of toddlers. The soft colors and simply told story will be popular with very young toddlers, With only 12  thick pages and 22 different words, this board book may also appeal to the very early reader.	2002-09-23

It has a gentle pastoralism (\\"Beech Green...is extremely pretty, with flower-studded banks or wide grass verges, clumps of trees, and a goodly amount of hawthorn hedging\\") somewhat reminiscent of Kenneth Grahame's writing in \\"The Wind in The Willows.\\"  Although the pace is slow, and the excitement minimal, Miss Read retains your attention with her relaxing yet vigorous prose, her keen observations and precise descriptions, and her loving devotion to the English countryside and its inhabitants.<br />The characters and plot are somewhat predictable.  Miss Quinn, a fastidious and introverted administrative assistant, rents a room in beautiful \\"Holly Lodge\\" from recently widowed Joan Benson.  She hopes to settle there comfortably when she learns that her sister-in-law (of whom she is not especially fond) is in the hospital.  Mrs. Miniver-like, Quinn rushes to the house and bravely takes on the house, the children, and her own prejudices about her sister-in-law.  Despite her domestic triumphs and the briefly described attentions of a young man, she decides (perhaps prematurely, perhaps not) that \\"spinsterhood\\" (and no children) might best suit her temperament.<br />A feminist tract this is not; in fact, it seems to have been written at least two generations ago.  Therein lie its appeal and its flaws. Some readers may grow frustrated (or weary) with the lack of excitement, the old-fashioned treatment of the children (the author seems to imply that the children need a slap on the arm from Miss Quinn, even though the parents don't approve), as well as an unfortunate analogy with concentration camps.  They may wish that Miss Read had slightly more modern sensibilities.  Other readers will likely ignore this and delight in the carefully wrought little village that is so simply and beautifully rendered.	2002-09-13

He examines the importance of a song's \\"singability.\\"  Furia, as in `Poets' traces the history of the theatre song as a stand-alone number (a la Ziegfried Follies) to its height as an integral \\"character\\" that advances the show's plot (first accomplished in \\"Showboat\\" and \\"Oklahoma.\\"  Finally, he shows how Ira Gershwin's style (and often his skill) was different from other lyricists of the Golden Age.<br />The problem is that there is a dearth of original research, especially about Ira's latter non-writing years.  I wonder why the author did not interview Michael Feinstein, who befriended Gershwin in the latter year, and here receives a one paragraph cite on the next to the last page. Most of the references on the latter years come from two books alone.  Furthermore, while not the life of the party like George, we don't get much of a clue as Ira's personality or personal life.  Some original research into Gershwin's personal life and post-writing years would have added greatly to the book. Finally, his use of phrases such as \\"saying I love you in 32 bars\\" and \\"singability\\" is so repetitive that it becomes grating.<br />Still, this is an excellent book for students of songwriting and Gershwin fans in particular.  There are some excellent behind-the-scenes details about how songs are written (and sometimes ruined) and it's mostly an enjoyable read.

Set as a chapter book, \\"Movie Magic\\" describes a young girl's experience making a movie, from her audition to acting, makeup, wardrobe, set production, sound, lighting, special effects, and post-production. There are very informative explanations of the technical aspects of film making, especially those dealing with cinematography and special effect techniques.

Two children stricken with diphtheria need medicine, but the train that carries it gets stuck in the snow, 700 miles from Nome. The town's only hope is a 21-team dog sled relay to deliver the precious medicine. Balto, the head dog on the second to the last run, leads his team through blinding snowdrifts and over a frozen river, and around cracking ice, and reaches Nome almost ten days before the expected arrival. He becomes famous: In New York City, thousands of miles away, a statue of Balto is put up in Central Park.<br />This is an exciting book, with soft, slighted muted illustrations and short sentences, is an excellent book (especially for adventure and dog lovers) for the reader in from around grades 1 through 3.  The suspenseful narration and the real heroics of Balto and his driver (along with the 20 other dog teams) make for a dramatic story. 48 pages, includes map of the trail to Nome.	2002-07-27

Ignorant men, usually black, and usually next to illiterate, address one another in a set of  \\"conversational\\" exchanges... It is just that they converse with their physiques.\\" -Norman Mailer, \\"Ego,\\" March 1971<br />This is an excellent book, not only for those interested in perhaps the greatest boxer of all time, but for people interested in the separate and combined effects of race, the 1960's, and the subjectivity of writing.  For example, it appears that Patterson and  Mailer held contradicting opinions about Ali's  talking, and, much this book's fun is how Ali served as a projective test for the attitudes and values of others--Mailer in particular is a hoot.<br />Ali's larger-than-life persona draws such literary heavyweights as Amiri Baraka, the humorist and essayist A.J. Liebling, Mailer, Joyce Carol Oates, George Plimpton, Irwin Shaw, Gay Telese, Garry Wills, and Tom Wolfe. Ali is a symbol, yes, but an individual  too, and the better essays show him as a multifaceted, intelligent, and controversial person.  Three interviews (\\"Black Scholar,\\" uncredited, June, 1970; \\"Playboy,\\" uncredited, November 1975;  \\"Sport,\\" Joe Torres, December 1981) let the champ speak for himself.<br />The book is full of great writing (except for Hunter S. Thompson's annoying self-aggrandizing piece and Wills' non-illuminating intellectualism), and offer snapshots of Ali from 1962 through his post-Atlanta Olympics acclaim in the late 1990's.  A blend of facts and iconography, the book is a fascinating look at Ali both inside and outside the ring. (Some pieces were edited for this book, but there is a bibliography on source material.

Some of it is quite humorous \\"...Get our California Gold Grease! Only 10$ a box. Rub on your body, roll down a hill.

Both during the gold rush and after its height a gold-based service economy arose to meet the needs (at highy inflated prices) of the miners.<br />The book describes how gold was mined, and the properties of gold that make it valuable \\"A piece of gold the size of a pea can be stretched into a wire that is two miles long. ...Gold is eight times heavier than stones and sand. Gold is sturdy, yet soft.\\" Surprisingly informative and always interesting, with Michael Eagle's portraits and exciting scenes illustrating the already exuberrant text.

For example, opposite a picture of a very majestic German Shepherd holding a leash in his mouth is the quote \\"Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power.\\" -Lao Tzu/Tao Te Ching.  All quotes are attributed to their sources, and there is a list of the pictured dog breeds at the back (unfortunately the pages are not numbered).  Some quotes are from the Tao, others from Buddha  (\\"The fool who knows he is a fool is that much wiser. The fool who thinks he is wise is a fool indeed,\\" opposite a quizzical looking mixed), Sanskrit, and individuals as diverse as Goethe, Rumi, Robert Persig, and the Dalai Lama.<br />It is slightly annoying that some quotes are cited only to the names of other books (e.g.,\\" Zen Flesh, Zen Bones,\\" \\"The Little Zen Companion.\\"). The book doesn't completely elucidate the dog-Zen equation in its brief introduction, but this is obviously  more for dog lovers than for serious students of Eastern religion and philosophy.  A few photos could have better arranged or focused (and once in a while a quote seems a bit forced onto the picture), but overall this is a funny, calming, and sweet book that will speak to your inner dog.  The nicely formatted book has 107 pages (including photos), and can be perused for light humor as well as insight.	2002-06-24

Steve Martin's collection of \\"New Yorker\\" short pieces is so intellectually inspired, that one is tempted to analyze it and perhaps alienate potential readers.  So, I will restrain from doing that. Nor will I try to imitate his inimitable style (uh oh, too late!). On with the review:<br />This is a hilarious, smarmily profound (in the manner that Martin seems to have invented), clever, wise, stimulating, and yes, laugh-out-loud (Martin could do a whole essay on that overused phrase) funny book. As a slim volume (115 pages) it's a bit pricey, but the material is so dense, so rich with humor, that even the least of these is worth reading several times over. Martin absolutely skewers the trendy in such pieces as \\"Closure\\" and \\"On Writing\\":<br />\\"Because topics are in such short supply, I have provided a few...<br />'Naked Belligerent Panties': This is a good sexy title with a lot of promise...<br />Something about how waves at the beach just keep coming and coming and how amazing it is (I smell a best-seller here).<br />'Visions of Melancholy from a Fast-Moving Train': Some foreign writer is right now rushing to his keyboard, ready to pound on it like Horowitz.\\"<br />Like Bill Murray, Martin can both inhabit and distance himself from his targets, and he is a master of light-hearted mockery: In \\"Dear Amanda,\\" as Joey, he writes \\"It was a lucky coincidence that my cat leapt on your speed-dial button last night, as it gave us a chance to talk again. Afterwards, I was wondering what you meant when you said, `It's over, Joey, get it into your head.'\\"<br />Martin's own topics are mostly about the arts in general, and writing in particular.  He has a knack for the throwaway line (from \\"Times Roman Font...\\"): \\"Bobby Brainard, a writer living in an isolated cabin in Montana, who is in fact the only writer living in an isolated cabin in Montana who is not insane...\\"), as well as the pithy observation (from Hissy Fit: \\"He fails to see that Los Angeles is a city of abundant and compelling almosts.\\").  He writes movingly and with great subtlety in a tribute to Walter Matthau that doesn't read like a tribute (\\"Michael Jackson's Old Face\\").  And there's his extraordinary tale of irony (the clash, I suppose, of text and subtext) in the very funny \\"Drivel\\": \\"She had painted a tabletop still life that was a conceptual work in that it had no concept.  Thus the viewer became a `viewer,' who looked at a painting, which became a `painting...' Dolly could take the infinitesimal pause to imply the quotations around a word (she could also indicate italics with just a twist of her voice).\\"  She breaks up with him when he actually likes one of her paintings \\"without any irony whatsoever.\\"<br />Every once in a while, in the midst of the non-sequiturs and wise observations, there is a phrase or sentence (only once, a story, \\"Bad Dog\\") that sounds off, or a bit lazy, or just sophomoric. For example, after this wonderful exchange (from \\"Lolita at Fifty\\"): \\"'Name?' `Lo-lee-tah.' She spoke her name like a steam radiator with consonants,\\" Martin follows with \\"'Last name?'  `Lolita Rooney-Burton-Winn-Fortensky-Guccioni,' she said, omitting a few names and adding a few to jazz it up.\\"  Or in \\"Side Effects,\\" in the middle of a string of increasingly outrageous patter (like his early \\"What I Believe\\" performance), he writes \\" If this (i.e., secondary sexual side effects) happens, women should write a detailed description of their last three sexual encounters and mail to me, Bob, trailer 6, Fancyland Trailer Park, Encino, CA. OR e-mail me at `hotguy.com.'\\"  Too easy.<br />But this is a wonderfully funny book by the master himself, one of the few comic geniuses of the last 100 years. In his writing and performance, he balances the intellectual and the plain silly, pomposity and minimalism, and finds the grain of truth at the heart of humor. When he received the first \\"Jack Benny Award\\" from UCLA many years ago, he accepted it with great solemnity, and then (after a perfectly timed pause), he bounded gleefully up and down the stage like a small child.  Highly recommended writing which satisfies more with each reading.ly timed pause), he bounded gleefully up and down the stage like a small child.

Unlike other first-person novels (or dialogue in 3rd person), Hart gives John and Tina (her chosen Anglicized name) authentic voices true to their strengths and, most importantly, limitations.  The bounds on their perceptions and emotional responses ring true: Goddard's cynical and sometimes sweeping moralizing tone, for example, seems appropriate for a man tuned into the \\"black and white\\" rather than the gray shades: \\"Then there's Memorial Day...here the underlying theme is human sacrifice by auto crash, as thundering engines and screaming gears are echoed a millionfold on the nation's highways.\\"  Though the book effectively attacks the ESL practices and the self-righteous administrators who impose them, Hart restrains from using his characters' voices as a proxy for his own; they do not suddenly become eloquent or insightful so that Hart can make a point.<br />The book's pace, character development, and alternating narratives show great balance. Hart is patient with his characters, letting them reveal explosive bits of the past in wider and wider circles as they approach their Vietnam experiences.  Mr. Goddard initially confronts the past indirectly, seeking answers in the lives of other war survivors: Ulysses, the prototypical soldier and war refugee, humorist/Civil War veteran Ambrose Bierce, and in his own farcical but somewhat detached Vietnam novel.  However, this intellectualizing does not abate his continuing symptoms strongly indicative of PTSD (e.g., nightmares, flashbacks, isolation, anger).

Let A Simile Be Like Your Umbrella	If it were possible to write the Great American Novel, \\"escape\\" could easily be its theme. America was, in part, founded upon escape: from persecution, famine, and class, and, for those who came to America but were denied freedom, escape from slavery. Michael Chabon's sprawling novel, \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay,\\" explores the dimensions of escape: physical and psychological, literal and metaphorical, and the complex relationship between escaping from and escaping to.<br />The first 100 or so pages of the book are incredibly powerful. Josef Kavalier is a trained escape artist who uses his talents to leave Nazi-occupied Prague for America. The oppression and suffering are palpable, as are the humanity and suffering of the persecuted Jews. To fool the Nazis, Kavalier shares a trick casket with a golem, a clay figure of Jewish religious significance; both are symbols of the Jewish community's near-death and faith. Chabon is at his tragicomic strongest here, exquisitely recreating the atmosphere of the survival of faith against brutality. This section alone stands as a superb novella.<br />Once in New York City, Kavalier rooms with his cousin Samuel Clayman (a pun on the golem), whose own escapes from reality yield mixed results. The two young men create the eventually wildly successful comic \\"The Escapist,\\" a costumed superhero who battles evil forces and rescues the helpless in an initially vicarious exercise for Kavalier. The book is again wondrous here, detailing the low-rent, fly-by-night \\"enterprises\\" of those A.J. Liebling once described as \\"The \\"Telephone Booth Indians\\" (Chabon cites Liebling in the book's acknowledgements, along with several other sources that show the scope of the author's research).<br /><br />About midway through, the book begins to lose some of its focus and the force of its words. Chabon's wizardry with words begins (at times) to seem gratuitous, much like his introduction of various historical figures such as Al Smith, Salvadore Dali, Orson Welles, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Senator Estes Kefauver (I was glad to find that Chabon restrained himself from somehow including American icons Billie Holliday and Joe Dimaggio as well.) To be fair, though, I have a bias against this style; others will enjoy the inclusion of these characters as well as a glimpse into the mechanics of the 1939 World's Fair). In addition, the historical allusions and footnotes add to the book's verisimilitude.<br />Chabon's spiraling, cascading sentences sometimes work magic, but sometimes seem to ignore Agatha Christie's literary dictum to \\"kill your darlings.\\" At worst, the prose seems self-indulgent and congratulatory, much like the showy magicians that Kavalier's Prague teacher so disdains. Chabon's voice is so distinctive, his sentences so dazzling, that at times he almost parodies himself, and one is tempted to imagine sentences with his style and diction (\\"effluvium,\\" and \\"detritus\\" come immediately to mind. The unpredictable becomes predictable; the writing seems out-of-touch and wearily linear, like an overly long drum solo or a beloved but stale verbal heirloom.<br />The last thematic section portrays Kavalier's psychological escape, from his loved ones and from himself, as tragedy hits him. His much-criticized (among reviewers here) retreat to Antarctica is actually fairly interesting, especially if taken on a more metaphorical level, and it sets up the other theme of the book, where and how does one return after escaping. Joe Kavalier's largely unexplored 11-year absence is not as irritating when taken as a symbol of retreat after his traumatic WW11 experiences, and this last section's largesse (about reversing an escape from home to the psychological commitment journey towards belonging and reconciliation) is described with almost the same power and restraint that Chabon shows in the opening Prague scenes. (Later sections on Joe's Empire State Building escapade and the Senate hearing on comic books aresomewhat superfluous.) That the characters don't develop much during this 11-year sleep is Chabon's on-target indictment of suburbia, the conformity of the 50's, and the habit-born comforts and gnawing disillusionment that equally inhabit the borders of approaching middle age. Only Joe's love interest, Rosa Saks, lacks sufficient depth here. I cannot imagine her earlier spirit so vulnerable to the effluvium of habit, a miasma pouring like ether from a culture too tired to question itself (as Chabon, though with greater skill, might put it. It must be fun to have Chabon's godlike creative productivity...so many structures and words from which to choose). Wouldn't Rosa have at least explored the new directions in arts and literature?<br /><br />Because of these faults and annoyances, I dock the book a half-point, but this is a superb, imaginative book well deserving of its accolades and Pulitzer. One may like it even more if one is not familiar with his earlier works, because the literary fireworks will seem less familiar (as was my own experience with reading his beautiful, astonishingly good debut novel, \\"The Mysteries of Pittsburgh\\"). Very highly recommended!somewhat superfluous.)

Each of the 40 pages (divided into three short chapters) has pictures and just a few sentences, making this a great beginning reader's book or a fun story for adults to read out loud.<br />There is a nice message about variety: Mudge meets and enjoys other dogs; the snowman contest features many different snowman ideas and decorations...

The book offers excellent, non-technical explanations for kids with enough detail to keep things interesting.  For example, the telephone section (15 pages) mentions sound waves, diaphragms, and radio waves; the television section concisely explains the mixing of color light waves, as well as the transmitter, the antenna, and cable TV, and the section on toilets not only contains a sly reference to Virginia Woolf's \\"Flush,\\" but explains the basic mechanics of the handle, the float, the rubber stopper, the septic tank, and the plunger (when things get stuck). A nice combination of whimsy and fact, this is an excellent book for the young scientist and the merely curious.  Adults may learn from it as well. With 47 pages, simple (but not \\"amateurish\\") illustrations, and a one-page index!	2002-01-22

The reader follows the flight of an umbrella-wielding boy swept up by the wind.  The pictures show a bird's eye view of the varying landscapes, including a flight over a dam, past a train (with which he almost collides), a waterfall, the docks of what looks like Boston, and his final safe landing back to the park where it all began.  Some of the pictures may be a little frightening to sensitive toddlers; on the other hand, they may be reassured by the boy's happy landing.  The 30 pages of watercolor pictures are luminously rendered, and the adult and young child can talk have a dialogue about \\"what happens next?\\" or \\"where is he now?\\"  This is a nice opportunity for toddlers (and pre-toddlers) to add their own words to a beautifully illustrated story.	2002-01-22

The last section \\"Working There,\\" briefly talks about teen and professional employment.<br />There isn't very much on the art and architecture of rides; the book is written at a more macro level describing the staff needed to run a park.  Additionally, most featured parks are in California, and they are described fairly briefly.  Still, the text is well written, there are some fascinating facts (e.g., two 450-horsepower pumps get water speeds up to 30 miles an hour at California's \\"Magic Mountain\\"), and some nice color and black and white photos.  I think it may be best as a book to read to youngsters; those who can read may want something a little more technical and up-to-date.	2002-01-22

Three of the eight illustrations are two-page spreads, including the tall Scottish tower.<br />Daily life is described briefly, and the flaps open to show more detail about the various occupants and their use of each building. Open one of the tower flaps, for example, and you see the Scottish lord's servants and soldiers eating in the great hall, and read that meals were &quot;served on a slice of stale bread, instead of a plate.&quot; Peer inside the French farmhouse to view a boy lifting a heavy sack of grain, or find the patchwork quilt in the house above the Old West general store. The slim book provides a snapshot of both the delights and the hardships of life in earlier times. This is an excellent book to explore for fans of flaps, history, architecture, and culture.	2002-01-15

True to form, he asked for the easiest instrument, and after failing at the balalaika (is that really the easiest?) and the fiddle he asks for a horn. Dunno, with little work, gets some sounds: &quot;the horn blared and coughed and wheezed.&quot; Trills admonishes him: Blowing a horn is not the same as playing it; noise is not the same as music (Trills is obviously not a fan of avant-garde jazz). Alas, none of the neighbors like his horn either, and Dunno spitefully says he won't play again.<br />The book's beauty lies in Boris Kalaushin's gloriously folk-style illustrations. There's an Eastern European flavor here that perfectly accompanies Nosov's text (translated from the Russian by Margaret Wettlin). The book is Pinnochio-like, only in reverse: Dunno's lack of effort results in his failure to become a musician. (In fact, the colors and woodcut style are somehow reminiscent of Disney's animated Pinnochio movie.) Recommended for book lovers of every age, particularly those with an affection for stylized old-fashioned illustration.	2002-01-15

Merrill D. Peterson examines the characters of Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun and the issues facing them in (roughly) the first half of the 19th century.  These issues involved primarily the differing conceptions of the federal government (federal powers vs. states' rights) arising in the Constitution Conventions of the Revolutionary War period.<br />This fundamental political difference was linked to other fiercely divisive issues, such as the moral and economic conflict over slavery, and eventually led to the Civil War (to put it simply).  Passions were so linked to sectional economic and political interests that the Civil War appears inevitable; indeed, one wonders why it didn't occur earlier.  Part of the answer is that Clay and others, through a series of \\"Compromises\\" delayed the war. The reader's attitude toward these three \\"giants\\" will depend on his/her own values and politics.<br />Peterson paints vivid portraits of the characters, but he assumes a fair amount of historical knowledge by the reader.  For example, his discussions on tariffs, the need to increase the debt, and other economic measures were often too dense, as were the detailed and somewhat confusing party realignments  (e.g., Whigs, Republicans, Democrats, \\"Ultras,\\" and various combinations of these).  Although he is sometimes dry, Peterson also has a scholar's wit and appreciation for his subject.  Furthermore, the political and legal manipulations of the principles are often fascinating (e.g., Calhoun's unconstitutional theory of states rights known as \\"Nullification;\\" the failure of all three to reach the presidency). At times, it feels lengthy (especially for the non expert; the book is basically written at a beginning graduate school level), but it is generally very well written and covers a fascinating period in American history.	2002-01-07

In fact, the bears and friends (Cousin Fred, Lizzy Bruin, and Dr. Wise Old Owl) are on their own as detectives.<br />They get a call that the mean, nasty Bogg Brothers (&quot;Not only did they rob and cheat, but they also made rude remarks...&quot;) have escaped from jail (again).  The Bears find that the police have most of the places with valuables covered, with one exception, the &quot;Bearsonian&quot; museum. Here, with the help of Professor Actual Factual, they that find several items have been stolen, and they proceed to solve the case.<br />The story is more original and the language more witty than usual in this series, and I also liked the setting: It makes museums sound very interesting. 48 pages, with bright pictures, and recommended by the publisher for readers in grades 2-3.

The book treads new ground in the annals of scatological literature.  The Gigglers are resourceful little creatures who administer &quot;dog poo&quot; punishment to adults who are mean or unfair to kids.  This time, however, the Gigglers make a mistake, and a variety of human and non-human characters attempt to rescue Mr. Mack from making an excremental next step.<br />This book (much like the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books) breaks many of the rules that often result in stiff, safe kids' fare.  First, Doyle never talks down to his young audience, he takes them into his confidence like an old friend, and spins wild adventures and non sequiturs without condescension or apology.  The book's sophistication is cinematic: Doyle cuts back and forth between the foot approaching the  poo, the circumstances leading to this messy scene, and  the history of the Gigglers. In addition, he  tells the story from different points of view: As omnipresent narrator, as talking dog ( you didn't know dogs could talk and earn money from Gigglers for their &quot;poo?&quot;) as the kids, even as the reader.  He also plays with the usually staid format of children's books, for example, creatively numbering or non numbering the chapters (&quot;This Chapter Is Named After My Mother Because She Said I Could Stay Up Late If I Named it After Her: Chapter Mammy Doyle&quot;) and providing an American-English/Irish glossary. Although dazzling in its execution,  Doyle's playful spirit never obscures the general requisites of a clear (though slightly askew)  story line or plausible motivation.<br />In short, this is a hilarious book, one of my 7-year old's favorites (he even loaned it to his second/third grade teacher to read in school).  The text is matched perfectly  by the glorious black and white shadings of illustrator Brain Ajhar. The book is for adults and kids who enjoy their humor both intelligent and silly, and probably not for the traditionalist.  It's simply one of the best of its kind.

(Frank Murphy  notes on the last page that Franklin really did have a pet squirrel, something that I thought was the author's invention). The book highlights Franklin's lifelong  knack for inventions and  chronicles his achievements as a  publisher, sciencist, writer, and patriot.  The book also introduces magic squares, showing how Frankinn invented one as he sat, bored, waiting to take notes for the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly.  There's a good explanation of magic squares (a nine-cell table in which 3  numbers counted vertically, horizontally, or diagonally add to the same number), and instructions on how to make your own magic square.  With 48 pages and colorful, evocative pictures, this book will appeal to the young reader, historian, and scientist.	2001-12-01

Wizard (a wizard) and Wart  a dog) are concerned when Zounds  (a vulture) announces that \\"Trouble\\" is coming.  Some minor trouble does come, in a way, but the wizard eventually get things straightened out.  And (Don't Look Cause This Will Give Away The Story) the \\"Trouble\\" that Zounds was talking about turns out to be just the name of another vulture!  The pictures are very colorful yet simply done.  A great book for beginning readers or for adults to read to kids.

This is an excellent book for the budding oceanographer  (or the beginning reader). It realistically shows the shark as predator (some of the pictures show sea animals being eaten by sharks, but the illustrations will probably not be upsetting for most), and as victim of the smarter, more teamwork-oriented dolphins.  The book does a great job of reporting interesting shark facts; for example, there are more than 300 types of sharks, the dwarf shark is no bigger than a hand, a barrel of nails was once found in a shark's belly, etc. 47 pages long, the publisher recommends it for readers in grades 1-3.

Leaving town because of a Harvest Festival next to his house, the Worst hops into his 1959 Edsel to get away it all:<br />\\"The polka band was rehearsing: When they paused, the worst stepped forward.<br />`Do you take requests?' said the worst.<br />`What would you like to hear?' said the leader.<br />\\"Total silence!' said the worst.<br />`I don't believe we know that one...\\"<br />After begrudgingly paying a quarter at a $2.50 toll booth (\\"that's an outrage\\"), the worst \\"arrives a few days later in Florida....palm trees swayed in the wind, people splashed in the surf...'I don't know how anybody can stand this place'\\", said the worst.<br />He takes the worst possible hotel (\\"Worstmor\\"; which is probably also the cheapest), and amongst the frogs and bats, the broken door, and the dirty pool, he finds someone almost as cranky as he is-A long lost relative:  \\"Well, don't expect any special rates...just because you're a relative.\\"  As usual, the worst softens a little upon his return home, and even donates a little something to the crafts booth.<br />It's unfortunate that so many of Stevenson's books are out of print or difficult to find.  His sly humor is accompanied by superb ink and watercolor drawings that the Worst probably wouldn't like: They're colorful and slightly whimsical.  Check out some other books by the prolific Stevenson, you'll find much to love.  30 pages, with at least one drawing on each page.	2001-11-27

The stories are linked through a tone of quiet wisdom and gentle humor that somewhat recall James Marshall's \\"George and Martha\\" adventures.

I suppose some interest in Revolutionary and Post-Revolutionary politics and history will help, but it's difficult to imagine that anyone with some curiosity about early America will find this tedious.<br />On the contrary, Ellis manages to capture the personalities and politics of seven \\"Founding Brothers\\" in a mere 248 pages full of sound observation, healthy cynicism, and a broad understanding of his role as historian. As noted by others, the book has 6 chapters (and an excellent 18-page preface) which frame major issues within the relationships of the \\"Brothers.\\"  Ellis examines the linked compromises between slavery, states' rights, and Federal monetary authority in \\"The Dinner\\" (Jefferson, Hamilton, and Madison); he describes the tempestuous politics in \\"The Duel\\" (Hamilton and Burr); and (through Adams and Jefferson in the final two chapters) he discusses the conflicts between national and state interests, and between sovereignty and rebellion.  Ellis' best chapter is \\"The Silence,\\" which posits the Union, from its inception, as a precarious alliance which could only \\"resolve\\" the contradiction of slavery by ignoring it.<br /> \\"...George Washington...also concurred that the ongoing debate in the House [under the auspices of Benjamin Franklin] was an embarrassing and dangerous nuisance that must be terminated.  The common version of leadership [was] a keen appreciation of the political threat that any direct consideration of slavery represented in the still-fragile American republic.  And the man who stepped forward to implement this version of leadership was James Madison...Madison's prudent and silent intervention rescued Jefferson from the secessionist implications of his revolutionary principles...\\"<br />The above is an example of Ellis' grasp of politics and political theory, as well as his dense but insightful writing.  My only complaint is the book's focus on Adams, Jefferson, and Washington; Madison, Franklin, Hamilton, and Burr (in order of their prominence within the book) are less central.  There is little, if anything, on the war of 1812 or the presidency of Madison, while Ellis' thoughts on the Adams/Jefferson correspondence become somewhat redundant.<br />Still, this is an illuminating and well-written book by an author who does not pull his punches. Speaking of Jefferson's letter stating that he always valued Adams' judgement (\\"with the single exception as to his political opinions\\"), Ellis humorously comments that this is a \\"statement roughly equivalent to claiming that the Pope was otherwise infallible, except when he declared himself on matters of faith and morals.\\"  In a relatively short book (too short, in my opinion), Ellis gets to the heart of the issues that both preoccupied the \\"founders\\" and that dominated the ensuing political landscape. Highly recommended.n Adams, Jefferson, and Washington; Madison, Franklin, Hamilton, and Burr (in order of their prominence within the book) are less central.

The temperature, according to records kept by Adams' former professor of science at Harvard, John Winthrop, was in the low twenties.&quot;<br />One can almost hear the amiable yet dramatic tones of historian David McCullough, punctuated by paintings of New England blizzards and the sound of hoofbeats. (McCullough is a frequent narrator of documentaries, notably those of Ken Burns.) McCullough's familiar cadence resounds through this extremely well written best-seller. The details never slow the reading or obscure the portrait; instead, source materials (much of it from the Adams' personal letters) illuminate and concretize his subject. McCullough writes clearly, forcefully, and with an ear for detail, humor, and anecdote.<br />Overall this is a flattering portrait of Adams' longtime service as lawyer, revolutionary, writer and philosopher, diplomat, politician, and farmer. The book could well have been subtitled: &quot;An Appreciation,&quot; both because Adams demonstrates so much to admire (including integrity, erudition, patriotism, work ethic, and courage) and because McCullough either doesn't criticize Adams or couches his disapproval by leaving some issues open.<br />Some readers may suspect a positive bias. Criticized and embattled by Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton--and by the libelous hyperbole of opposition newspapers and rivals--Adams takes on an almost martyr-like persona. To test McCullough's balance, one must read other books on both the Founders and the political culture of the times. Joseph Ellis' &quot;Brothers of the Revolution,&quot; for example, is a more analytic, speculative, and impersonal book than &quot;John Adams,&quot; and Ellis does not temporize on such issues as Jefferson's affair with Sally Hemmings. (McCullough: &quot;for all the rumors . . . relatively little would ever be known.&quot; Ellis: &quot;which was only confirmed beyond any reasonable doubt by DNA studies done in 1998 . . . &quot;). Ellis engages in comparatively more &quot;psychobiography&quot; (&quot;[Adams had] a congenital inability to separate his thoughts from his feelings about them&quot;); McCullough resists theory, and relies more on the literal evidence of his source materials. Also, because it is a biography, we miss some history: Since Adams was an ambassador in Europe during the war, securing French naval assistance and Dutch money, there is little mention of the country's trials military victories in the latter years of the war. Hamilton's role in stabilizing the country through the Federalist papers and establishment of a central bank receive little attention.<br />There is little question that Adams was, for the most part, the right man for the times, largely steering clear of both Republican and Federalist extremes. McCullough demonstrates that Adams was largely underappreciated by his contemporaries. More than Jefferson, Adams seems the man of the people, as well as the more flexible: Adams was an idealist when the times called for it; a pragmatist when they did not.<br />McCullough includes some fascinating insights into Adams' personal life, especially his love, partnership, and correspondence with Abigail Adams and their son, John Quincy Adams. One comes away liking Adams, despite certain tempermental qualities implied by McCullough. The book documents just how well (and how often) Adams served his country, no matter what the inconvenience to himself or his family. Overall, the appreciation is well deserved. Readers will likely use this fine biography as a springboard to further investigations, such as Ellis' book. &quot;John Adams&quot; has 654 pages of text; additionally, there are black and white as well as color plates, extensive source notes, and a thorough index.

A book that not only places song lyrics within the realm of literature, but also contains those lyrics in their entirety, This is the most complete book of English and American lyrics around: It contains all the lyrics (other than a song sheet, where will you find refrain 4 of &quot;The Lady is a Tramp?&quot;) to more than 1,000 songs from the late 19th century  to 1975, including the prototypical works of Gershwin, Porter, Hart, Mercer, Comden and Green, Berlin, Fields, Cahn, and Strayhorn. Dozens of relatively less prodigious and famous lyricists are included as well.<br />The book is a dream for jazz lovers. With the complete lyric and verse of &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (for example), one can appreciate Billy Holiday's vocals or Coleman Hawkins' definitive sax, or--warn your housemates--sing along!  From &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; (1925) to &quot;All of Me&quot; (1931) to &quot;Peel Me a Grape&quot; (1962), this is a rich compendium of the English language songbook.<br />The organization is somewhat confusing: Lyricists are ordered by date of birth. True, one glimpses the evolution of the form, but with little context or theory this presentation is often more confusing than illuminating. (Fortunately, there are capsule biographies as well as a brief but informative introduction.) Other tips to navigating the book: The Index of Songs contains all songs in alphabetical order, the year they were written, the source, if not a recording (e.g., show, nightclub act, film) and the singer most associated with the song.  Unfortunately, there is no index of lyricists, so one must search the lengthy Table of Contents, or work backwards and find the lyricist through the Song Index.<br />Small matter.  As far as I know, this is the only book of its kind.  A wonderful reference, &quot;Reading Lyrics&quot; makes a wonderful gift for the shower singer, the jazz buff, or the poetry lover. Very highly recommended!	2001-10-10
1864270:US	49600435	R34BEXBYG5Z4H5	0306802171	21495686	Mingus: A Critical Biography (A Da Capo paperback)	Books	4	17	17	N	Y	Giant of Jazz	This is a slightly disappointing, but still very good biography of one of the greatest jazz composers and probably its top bassist.  Mingus, using a mixture of jazz, blues, church music, European impressionism and march music, and folk, wrote some of the most outstanding music of the 20th century. A man of wide-ranging, complicated emotions, lionesque appetites, and varied intellectual and creative pursuits, this titan of modern music is a fascinating biographical subject.<br />However, Brian Priestley does not capture the full measure of the man and his music. I'm not sure what the subtitle &quot;A Critical Biography&quot; is meant to convey, but there is not enough musical criticism.  Particularly in the second half of the book, Priestley resorts to an &quot;and then he wrote&quot; approach, painstakingly detailing every new composition or derivative, and every new musician in the ever-changing Mingus ensemble. There is musical analysis, but often it is more technical than critical.  Referring to a song on &quot;East Coasting&quot; Priestley writes, &quot;it incorporates passages of G minor twelve-bar blues only slightly different from the opening of `Eulogy' (Im/bVImaj\bII7\V7 instead of Im|bVImaj7\IIm7b5\v7).&quot; The first part of this sentence is the more revealing: &quot;It is a tribute to Mingus' maturing methodology that ideas are shown to be capable of repetition and rearrangement.&quot;<br />This does not go far enough, though.  Why did Mingus &quot;cross-breed&quot; so many of his works, as Priestley notes but never really examines.  The reasons (aesthetic, psychological--practical in the case of &quot;Slop&quot;) for the similarities among some works (e.g., &quot;Better Get Hit Into Yo Soul&quot;, &quot;Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting&quot;, &quot;Slop,&quot; and other compositions is never really explored. Were Mingus' edits across versions and his reworking of similar themes an attempt to forge a new &quot;traditional&quot; folk music within a mere two decades? (Perhaps this hypothesis is off, but I would have preferred that Priestley write a more encompassing analysis of both the whole of Mingus' work and its constituent parts.)<br />Conversely, we may praise the author for not indulging in psycho-biography, for including extensive well-documented quotes from Mingus as well as other musicians, and for describing enough on-stage Mingus behavior to get a sense of his personality.  One might want to read the excellent though brief &quot;Mingus/Mingus: Two Memoirs&quot; for a better look at the offstage Mingus and his relationships with non-musicians.<br />The strength of the book is the extensive documentation of the entire Mingus discography, the ever shifting lineups, and both the recorded and non-recorded performances. This must have been a labor of love, as Priestley gives the definitive record of Mingus' output and how the performances map onto the different albums. The appendices include musical notations of ten (!) bass excerpts, a second-by-second structural analysis of &quot;The Black Saint...,&quot;and notes to all citations in the book.  This is invaluable for the Mingus fan.<br />Priestley's writing can be awkward, &quot;She it was who wrote....,&quot;  and strained &quot;Any minimally serious astrological guide will describe the typical Taurean as having outsized physical appetites; what is perhaps even more relevant to Mingus is the ability to treat extramarital affairs (like the ice-cream [sic] of which he was so fond) as a dessert complementing, but in no way threatening, any long-established relationship.&quot;<br />Despite the reservations noted above, I can recommend this book as a comprehensive resource for Mingus fans.  It also includes enough personal information and sympathy (through interview excerpts with Mingus and others) that one begins to appreciate his complexities. There are a few clues to his Joycean autobiography, &quot;Beneath the Underdog,&quot; and one gets a good sense of the racial tensions and injustices battled by Mingus.  Finally, judging from the reviews of the other major Mingus biography, &quot;Myself When I Am Real,&quot; this is the best book currently available. It will be enhanced, however, if read with the aforementioned autobiography (as perplexing as it is) and &quot;Mingus/Mingus,&quot; as well as the brief but excellent critiques in &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz.&quot;  Includes 25 black and white photos, notes, appendices, and an extensive index.racial tensions and injustices battled by Mingus.

Sue Denim's &quot;Dumb Bunnies&quot; series is full of verbal (and visual) puns and other language-based humor, much of it clever, some of it puerile. The humor can be at a fairly low level, and the adjective &quot;dumb&quot; is not used in any redeeming way. Unlike the similarly confused &quot;Amelia Bedelia&quot; character, the bunnies are neither particularly sweet nor well-meaning; unlike &quot;Curious George,&quot; there isn't a tradeoff between mischief and heroics; unlike Homer Simpson, the questionable IQ is not balanced by other personal qualities.<br />Despite these minor objections, Denim does knows humor for the young set.  In this story, the &quot;dumb bunnies&quot; confuse themselves and others during a zoo trip, and generally cause trouble for all. A lot of the humor is in the background zoo signs:&quot;Free Admission. Free Ice Cream. Free Popcorn. All For One Low Price,&quot; and &quot;Hot Dogs. Chilly Dogs. Room-Temperature Dogs.&quot; Dave Pilkey's illustrations are bright and colorful without overwhelming.  A good book for around ages 4 to 7.  Note: Although for older readers/listeners, Pilkey's &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; books deliver even more bathroom humor (for those who like that--and I know that many kids do), but they are more cleverly designed and plotted than this book.	2001-08-19

For the newcomer, however, Brookshiser sheds light on one of the most interesting on the \\"Founders,\\" a self-made man who became the leading exponent of Federalism and brought economic structure to the foundling (and sometimes floundering) country.<br />Brilliant, visionary, and enormously articulate, Hamilton was quick to argue his positions, most notably in \\"The Federalist  Papers,\\" in a series of anonymous letters to newspapers, and in the courtroom. His belief in a strong central government drew him into conflict with other luminaries, including Virginia Thomas Jefferson.  His politics and simmering rivalry with Aaron Burr culminated in a famous duel. Today, when we think of Jefferson et al. as apolitical \\"statesmen,\\" it is instructive to view the ferocious politics of the era.<br />Brookshiser's non-academic, breezy style enlivens the characterization of the people, the times, and the economic issues. Unfortunately, this style sometimes works against him: Describing the Hamilton/Burr communiques preceding the duel, Brookshiser merely states \\"It would dignify the mummeries that followed to describe them in detail.&quot; Still, Brookshiser's book is a welcome addition to the literature on the Revolution and early American politics.

First, Grady is not a likeable character, and though I can't fault Chabon for Grady's dubious qualities, I don't think the author adequately explained why Grady never seemed to have matured, either as a responsible person or as a writer. The book's first person narrative is also problematic. Unlike, say, P.G. Wodehouse, it's not always clear when Chabon thinks his character is a buffoon, and when he intends us to take the character seriously, i.e., as an extension of Chabon's own views. Some of the characters seem too easily drawn, and the farce becomes a sophomoric parade of stereotypes (the brilliant but troubled student and Frank Capra fan; the kindly father-figure/prospective father-in-law, etc.). Finally, there are a number of &quot;grand&quot; themes in the book that remain unconvincing; most notably, that there is an &quot;incurable disease that leads all good writers to suffer, inevitably, the quintessential fate of their characters.&quot; Such ambitious but unconvincing theorizing coupled with his occasionally overly decorous prose make for a sometimes pretentious voice. (But is it Grady's or Chabon's voice?--we're not really sure.)<br />The book primarily succeeds as a broad farce, and it is easy to see how the melange of characters and &quot;scenes&quot; lends itself easily to the big screen. (I haven't seen the recent movie with Michael Douglas.) I recommend this as &quot;summer reading&quot;: Light, humorous, and fanciful. However, it sometimes bogs down in its own narrative virtuosity, and fails to convince us of its &quot;heavier&quot; literary themes.g coupled with his occasionally overly decorous prose make for a sometimes pretentious voice.

He's got no problem with the name until a school bully begins taunting him, calling him a girl (generally not received well by seven-year-old boys), and generally intimidating him.<br />Pinky, wondering if he's too old for such a nickname, decides to change his name back to Billy, and give his beloved animals to his sister.  Fortunately, an older neighborhood woman teaches him to accept himself as he is:<br />&quot;It's hard to be different, isn't it, Billy? ....But, believe me, it's worse not to be yourself. Don't change for other people, Billy. Other people will come and go in your life. Do what's right for the one person who will always be with you--yourself.&quot;<br />Her advise, and some newfound assertion by Billy/Pinky helps him out: &quot;Pinky walked straight up to Kevin and poked him in the chest . . . 'I'm not a sissy and I'm not a girl. And if you think so, it just shows how dumb you are.'&quot; OK, so Pinky gets slightly physical, but, overall, this is a fine book for the bullied--and those who bully them.  Forty pages long, with lovely soft color illustrations, a non preachy tone, and a nice inter-generational angle.  This book really seems to know the seven- year-old's mind.	2001-07-12

Published in 1963, it has a sweet tone reminiscent of 1950's TV shows. The fun, though, lies in  tracing and anticipating young Brown's using logic, a little science, and keen observation to solve minor crimes and mysteries.  Sometimes, he's helping his police chief father; other times kids bring the mysteries directly to him.<br />Your child may successfully solve the mystery on his or her own (each of the 10 cases ends with a question, e.g., &quot;HOW DID ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN KNOW THIS?,&quot; or, after trying to find the culprit, they can turn to the back for the brief answers.  There's no tricks, though at least one story assumes a little more knowledge than might be expected from the average grade schooler. For example, one hint is that &quot;Bull Run&quot; was the Northern name for the Civil War battle, not the Southern name (although this solution has an easier clue as well).<br />A wonderful, captivating series of vignettes (ten cases covering 78 pages, not including solutions), I recommend this very highly.  It's also a great book for readers from about grades two through about six.	2001-07-12

Her usual targets are those who have skipped out on her employer, Max: A purveyor of bail bonds for some of New Jersey's most laughable--as well as most dangerous--alleged criminals.<br />She's a very likeable character, and her snappy dialogue, everyday tribulations, and downright nasty encounters with the bad guys keep you glued to the book.  Unfortunately, &quot;Hot Six&quot; is that the plot is filled with holes, the characters and their actions are often way beyond believable, and the mystery is solved partially--through withholding some important information from the reader.  Yes, this is a farce, and should not be taken too seriously, but Evanovich needs to infuse a little more credibility into the book to rank with the likes of Sue Grafton and other contemporary authors.<br />Evanovich is wildly popular right now, and I do recommend this book for breezy, page-turning fun.  However, a little more credibility and development would put this in a higher echelon.  Perhaps her newest book, &quot;Seven Up&quot; accomplishes that.  This book, however, rates 3* as a mystery, but 5* as a fun vacation read. It averages out to 4* for breezy, snappy, page-turning fun.	2001-07-09

She also wrote the four &quot;Claudine&quot; novels (1900-1903), and became celebrated  for &quot;Cheri&quot; (1920; followed by &quot;The Last of Cheri&quot; in 1926).<br />She regarded &quot;The Pure and the Impure&quot; as her best work; a mostly autobiographical treatise on Eros and love, particularly Sapphic love.  She mixes a reporter's objectivity with deeply felt analysis psychological and philosophical observations.  Sometimes she takes  a dispassionate, almost distant look at passion; other times her emotional attachments to  her subjects--primarily lesbian  aristocrats and artistes--are candidly exposed.<br />She is an exquisite writer without being precious.  Colette bends words and phrases perfectly, and one is struck by her vivid yet subtle prose, as evocative as Woolf but perhaps even more sensual. &quot;The Pure and the Impure&quot; contains memorable passages of keen observation and wit, and one feels  drawn to her observations:<br />&quot;...I delighted in the...empty gaiety of the chatter and the diverting and challenging exchange of glances, the cryptic reference to certain treasons, comprehended at once, and the sudden outbursts of ferocity. I reveled...in their half-spoken language, the exchange of threats, of promises, as if, once the slow-thinking male had been banished, every message from woman to woman became clear and overwhelming, restricted to a small but infallible number of signs...&quot;<br />This is not to deny, however, that reading the book  is sometimes difficult.  Whether due to the translation, the era, or Colette's  particular style, her writing can be challenging, particularly her last chapter, a very subjective, personal description of jealousy.<br />This is a beautifully written book about the erotic, about men and women, and about the natural history of love.

Wodehouse's &quot;Jeeves&quot; books are noted for their similarity of plot but suavity of execution. Of  the latter, a &quot;Times Literary Supplement (London)&quot; critic writes: &quot;...there comes a stage where the [inveterate] reader  . . . finds a new pleasure in seeing how exquisitely it is done.&quot;  The words &quot;facile&quot; and &quot;frothy&quot; describe Wodehouse's delectable concoctions, in which aristocratic Bertram &quot;Bertie&quot; Wooster finds himself inevitably drawn to the rescue of young lovers, a task to which he is eminently ill-suited.  (Bertie, in wave after wave of well-intentioned  malapropisms, undeserved self-esteem, unintentional ironies, misquoted allusions, and suspicion-raising bungling, would be the epitome of the foolish nouveaux riches, if only his own riche were nouveau.)  Instead, Bertie, appeals to the old &quot;feudal spirit&quot; of his cunning and erudite butler Jeeves, Bertie's superior in everything but station.  It is Jeeves who really comes to the rescue, bailing Wooster `out of the soup.'<br />The stars of this show (as others have noted, Wodehouse wrote these adventures in a theatrical, musical-comedy style) are two pairs of &quot;affianced&quot; lovers; the fetching Zenobia &quot;Nobby&quot; Hopwood and writer Boko Fittleworth, and the  intimidating couple of  Florence Craye and G.

Chichester Clam.<br />There are some annoying flaws in the book: Some fortuitous happenings that strain even the permeable bounds of farce:  the unexplained acceptance of Stilton by Lord Worplesdon, an outright lie by the proper (but usually more cunning) Jeeves, and the capitol punishment meted by foot to the backside of young Edwin.  The latter does not trouble his sister Florence, although we learn early on that &quot;Florence is one of those girls who look on modern enlightenments a sort of personal buddy.&quot;  This coup d'Edwin  may trouble some modern day readers. Still, this is  light farce and one may excuse this ugly punishment through a metaphorical reading.  After all, can one  really trust the narration of Bertie Wooster when he utters such gems as &quot; . . . and already much of the gilt, I feared, must now have rubbed off the gingerbread of their romance.&quot;<br />Although not as well crafted as &quot;The Code of the Woosters,&quot; this book certainly rivals the former in its rich cast and nimble dialogue, and its subtle thrashing of the manner and speech of the British aristocracy.

Well, probably not...but in both instances it's a very effective and heartfelt line, capturing the essence of unconditional, lasting love.<br />Corduroy is a cute little stuffed bear who nobody wants to buy: There are bigger and newer toys, and besides, the button is missing from one strap of his overalls. Only Lisa shows interest that day, but her mother hesitates and they leave without him. While looking for the button after the store closes, Corduroy experiences the wonders of a big department store: The elevator and the new beds lined in rows:  \\"This must be a palace...I guess I've always wanted to live in a palace.\\"<br />Lisa returns the next day and buys him with her own money, and the sugarcoated ending strikes up just the right amount of sentiment without becoming overbearing (no pun intended).  \\"This must be home,\\" he [Corduroy] said. \\"I know I've always wanted a home!\\"  And then: \\"You must be a friend,\\" said Corduroy. \\"I've always wanted a friend.\\"  \\"Me too!\\" said Lisa, and gave him a big hug.  Powerful, misty-eye making stuff!  Beautiful simple color pictures, and 28 pages of adventure and sweet love.  Awwww-inspiring (pun intended).  Highly recommended for the toddler set!	2001-05-25

Froggy wakes up full of enthusiasm for a day's bike ride and picnic with his dad, but his disorganization keeps them at home until the end of the day.  In between, Froggy looks around for assorted biking/picnic items (e.g., a ball, a helmet), slamming and bonking around, and finding them in the most unusual places (what ARE those peaches doing in his bed?!).  Each time the two are ready to leave another forgotten item must be found:<br />  \\"Frrrooggyy!\\" called his father. \\"I'm re-e-a-d-y!\\" yelled Froggy... \\"But Froggy...you need your bicycle helmet!\\" \\"I don't know where it is!...\\"  \\"It's wherever you left it!\\" \\"I forget!\\" \\"You have to LOOK for it!\\"  This little routine will sound familiar both to children and those who raise them! There's a happy denouement as both Froggy and his dad finally set out (after deciding they're both so hungry they'd better eat the picnic first-at home!).<br />Bright, uncluttered pictures, 27 pages, lots of word repetition and cool sound effects make this a treat to listen to and read.  A toddler who loved the listening to this book will enjoy returning to it as an older reader (perhaps around grade 2-3).	2001-05-25

Dr. Stephen Astor is a Californian allergist who has taught at both Stanford University and the University of California.  This is a clear and informative book about the nature and treament of allergies (as well as allergen-related asthma). Though brief (201 pages with Appendices on medications and on other allergy books), it covers the basic treatments and lets the potential patient know that options are available: &quot;By understanding both sides of the different claims made about allergy treatment, you can determine for yourself whether a new finding, drug, machine, or injection is new for you.&quot;<br />Astor's presentation of study results is always clear, and he makes a potentially tedious topic interesting by debunking common allergy myths, and summarizing major points through &quot;hints.&quot;  I hope that there will be a new edition (this third edition was published in 1992) when there is sufficient new information on allergies and their treatment.	2001-05-23

In this slim book , he traces the development of jazz, hitting all the basic elements: African polyrhythmic  drumming transported to Congo Square in New Orleans, work songs and slave songs, homemade instruments, spirituals, the blues, ragtime, minstrel shows, improvisation, the spread of jazz to New York and Chicago and the regional bands, the influence of Louis Armstrong.<br />Sound familiar?  It's the first eight hours or so of the Ken Burns' documentary &quot;Jazz,&quot; only much briefer and written for youngsters ranging from around ages 4 to 9 or so.  Although he ignores all the contributions of early women jazz artists  (singers are paid scant attention here), his tone is proudly inclusive (&quot;Of course, people were making music in other parts of our country in early times, too--not just in New Orleans.  In New England, settlers were singing their hymns. In Virginia and Kentucky, the newcomers were singing their ballads. In the Far West, the Indians were playing on their drums, African slaves in Georgia, the Carolinas, and other parts of the South, who did not always have drums on which to play, were making up songs to chop cotton to, load the river boats, or build the levees.&quot;) and emphasizes the joy of performance and improvisation (&quot;That is how the music called  jazz began--with people playing for fun.&quot;).<br />The straightforward narrative, although lacking the &quot;poetic&quot; imagery one might expect, is clear and joyful.  This is a excellent introduction for young readers. It is obviously not intended as an jazz encyclopedia, and jazz fans will have to ignore a few of its inherent limitations: The above-mentioned oversight of singers and of women (other than one list of pianists that includes Marion McPartland), the over-generalized portrayal  of early jazz musicians as untrained, and limited descriptions of Ellingtonto Jazz, swing, and bebop. (Although, for a book written in 1955 by a non-musician, Hughes mentions Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Max Roach, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young).  The book includes fun drawings by Cliff Roberts, a brief discography (apparently updated to include Coltrane, Mingus, and Ornette Coleman--but no Miles), a three-page definiton of terms, Hughes' list of his 100 favorite jazz recordings, and a  list of &quot;famous jazz musicians&quot; by instrument.a book written in 1955 by a non-musician, Hughes mentions Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Max Roach, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young).

Wodehouse through his mostly-true autobiography, &quot;Bring on the Girls,&quot; in which he  adroitly  recalls his theater days  with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern.  But Wodehouse is most famous for his &quot;Jeeves&quot; books, featuring  the wise and unflappable butler who extricates Bertram &quot;Bertie&quot; Wooster from all manner of ridiculous conundrums.  The wonder of these farces is that Wooster himself narrates the story, presumably unaware of his foolish prattling and numerous faux pas.  In the Jeeves books, Wodehouse  manages to write similar plots that are soothingly familiar and yet still ingenious.  Wodehouse typically sets the bumblings and posturing of the &quot;social betters&quot; against Jeeves' clever, no-nonsense, &quot;psychology of the individual&quot; solutions.  Wodehouse is nimble, nuanced, and both smilingly and laugh-out-loud funny.<br />This is a good, but somewhat disappointing (by the very elevated Wodehousian standards) work.  For one thing, Wodehouse's humorous devices are somewhat redundant, centered too often around Wooster's difficulties with words and phrases.  Wodehouse dips into this well just a little too often: &quot;Ceasing to expostulate then, if expostulate is the word I want,&quot; and &quot;What's the word I've heard you use from time to time--begins with eu?&quot; &quot;Euphoria, sir.&quot;  While perhaps a minor complaint, Wodehouse's vitality and invention are somewhat enervated by this reliance on  linguistic stumbling.<br />The plot involves (as usual) fiancees on the brink, Wooster  accused of pilfering, and assorted foolish/nasty characters gathered at his Aunt Dahlia's house. This time around, the butlers'club journal (in which the butlers record the less commendable actions of their employers)  is stolen by one of its members with a mind for political blackmail.  A wonderful engine for a story, but I thought Wodehouse lost some opportunities in not exposing any of the club book's contents, and paying just fleet attention to an apparently uproarious political debate.  It's true that Wodehouse is a master of understated humor, but I've read other books in which he better exploited an episode's comic possibilities.<br />Still, Wodehouse is always a treat: &quot;she guffawed more liberally than I had ever heard . . . If there had been an aisle, she would have rolled in it,&quot; and &quot;He . . . gave the impression, as Esmond did, of being able, if he cared to, to fell an ox with a single blow. I don't know if he had ever  actually done this, for one so seldom meets an ox . . . &quot;  Wodehouse's  nuanced humor and farcical elements are always enjoyable, especially in  Wooster's  scenes with Jeeves and with his aunt.  I just think that the initiate might better begin with a different, perhaps more humorous &quot;Jeeves&quot; book, such as the excellent  &quot;Code of the Woosters.&quot;  I hope you'll give P.G.

I suppose that one answer is to ask what isn't so admirable about non-curmudgeons:  People whose advise may reassure them more than you. After all, don't worry, be happy.<br />Sometimes just acknowledging the cranky, bilious soul is more effective than drowning it in bland sweetisms. This book recognizes your (or someone else's) bad self, and implicitly encourages you to go with it. Perhaps it's the mix that makes us more human.<br />This very funny collection of sarcastic, witty, cynical, caustic, and sometimes just downright... quotes will &quot;speak&quot; to you like the blues.  Quotes are arranged alphabetically by topic, so that you can look up &quot;G' for gratitude, and plagiarize Rochefoucauld: &quot;Gratitude is merely the secret hope of further favors.&quot;  Cynical--of course--but perhaps containing a grain of wisdom.  This topical organization doesn't work that well; the categories are too fine grained (who would think of &quot;dinner theatre?&quot;).<br />The best feature are the multi-page sections devoted to one of the masters: W.C. Fields, Oscar Wilde, George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, Quentin Crisp, Oscar Levant, and others. These sometimes take the form of interviews, biographies, and/or several pages of quotes.  However, sprinkled liberally throughout its 299 pages are gems (&quot;If you can't say anything good about someone, sit right here by me.&quot; -- Alice Roosevelt Longworth) by such notables as Marx (Groucho), Mencken, Bierce, and Twain and contemporaries such as Vidal, Woody Allen, and Rita Mae Brown.<br />Oh--in case you were wondering--it was Paul Fussell who said the following about dinner theatre:&quot;...a way of positively guaranteeing that both food and theatre will be amateur and mediocre, which means unthreatening and therefore desirable.&quot;<br />To its credit, the book stays away from most sexist and all racist &quot;jokes,&quot; it doesn't confuse humor with stupid attack.

They discover that they have a few things in common, and Molly learns that she can be babysat without losing her dignity.  A wonderful book, it conveys that adults can meet children on their  level without giving up their own.	2001-05-05

Suares has compiled a wonderful little photo book (78 pages) of mostly \\"old\\" Hollywood actors in various poses with canine friends and thespians. The earliest photo is a 1920's shot of the Little Rascals with pit bull mix, \\"Pete the Pup\\" (Suares informs us that the circle around the eye was drawn), and the most recent is James Belushi in 1989's \\"K-9.\\"<br />While a few shots are candids (e.g., a fabulous picture of Gable petting an Irish Setter on the set in 1931; Bogart with his Scottish Terriers), most are publicity stills or shots from movies.  These include Shirley Temple (and mutt) in \\"The Stowaway,\\" William Powell, Myrna Loy and-of course-ASTA in \\"After the Thin Man.\\" Katherine Hepburn with English Springer Spaniels in \\"A Bill of Divorcement,\\" and, perhaps most famously, Judy Garland with Toto (a Cairn Terrier).<br />The pictures are in glorious black and white. Even without the dogs, this is an enjoyable book: There are almost iconic-looking photos of Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow, Elvis Presley (with a hound dog), Roddy McDowall, and Elizabeth Taylor, to name a few.  Photos are captioned and there is a 4-page introduction by the author. Worth looking for!	2001-04-26

Some of the kids are a little nervous at first: Ralphie believes that bats are really vampires! The field trip shows otherwise, as bat-facts are presented in a creative and interesting manner.<br />The famous bus does do some magic here: Turning into a \\"bat bus\\" to demonstrate echolocation, and then turning the children into bats (temporarily!) so they can learn about bat food, bat predators, bat flight speed, and general \\"hanging around (upside down from the branches of a tree).\\"  Facts replace suspicion (Is Ms. Frizzle herself a vampire?  Did she turn the parents into vampires?), and the story ends with yet another pun.  (Be your own judge about whether this story might be too frightening for the very young).  With bright, colorful (but not extraordinary) illustrations on each one of the story's 28 pages, and two pages with letters about bats and bat facts. Probably not as exciting as Batman, but fans of \\"The Magic School Bus\\" and nature facts should love it.	2001-04-26

When  a witch pretends to turn him into a frog, Jerome proudly announces his new identity to the townspeople.  However, they are skeptical, and ask him to prove his royalty by performing three daring and tricky deeds.  Jerome succeeds through brains, not brawn, and since he does as a prince would do, the people decide he is a prince-just one who looks amphibian!<br />Jerome's solutions are clever (and, except in one case, fairy-tale plausible) and show  imaginative ways to solve seemingly difficult problems. The pictures are wildly colored, and the prose is coherent and sometimes enchanting (as when the wizard remembers when he used to be a boy: \\"secret codes and watermelon and horse chestnuts; telling stories under the porch; old aunts who smelled like flowers...\\"). If only more of the story were written that wonderfully!<br />Still, the great pictures and magical story earn this a recommendation, especially for young children.

First published in 1959, this is one of more than 30 books written by the great Bill Peet.  In it, a proud young lion loses his hair in an accident, and his animal friends come out to solve his problem.  An elephant remembers a cure (crocodile tears), but no animal is brave enough to collect them except the clever elephant.  However, the croc tonic works so too well, and a baboon is dispatched to trim the overgrown mane. The resulting haircut is a tribute to nonconformity:<br />\\"You can search every jungle, each circus and zoo, From San Francisco to Timbuctoo But I doubt that you'll find though you look everywhere A lion whose main is so perfectly square ............So there!\\"<br />The rhymes are delightful and the pictures are fun, relaxed, and absorbing!  Peet worked as an illustrator, scriptwriter, and producer for Walt Disney, so you may see some Disney-esque touches in the expressive animal drawings.  It's a great children's book (38 pages long).  Recommended!	2001-04-26

You strike up a relationship with a character, only to find that the last date is just a few pages away.<br />Melissa Bank solves this problem (as have others) by writing intertwined short stories about the same character: The likeable, funny, and insecure Jane Rosenal.  Her relationships with men (and other elusive goals) are the core of this humorous, easy-reading book.  It's neither pre- nor post-feminist, just a recognizable woman facing the complexities of love and work.<br />The first story is one of the best: Told from the teenage Rosenal's view, it shows her vicariously experiencing her brother's relationship and break-up with Julia, an upper class, sensitive college student.  Bank tells this story with the humor and perception of a J.D. Salinger (but without the Zen undertones).  Two of the seven stories deal with Rosenal's relationship with a famous, older, somewhat unconventional editor.  Bank is even-handed, as Archie alternates between mentor and monster, self-centered protector and sympathetic victim.  He's a concerned, loving partner, but also a publicity conscious show-off, telling stories about Jane as if she were in one of his books. Interwoven with this story is an emotional and very effective look at Jane's parents.<br />The sixth story is a series of vignettes told in a combination of the third (\\"In post-op, he will tell you he is honored you threw up on him.\\") and second person (\\"You see yourself through his eyes, as THE GENERIC WOMAN, the skirted symbol on the ladies' room door\\"). Here, Banks writes with a faux-tough style that recalls Liz Phair:  \\"Everywhere you go, you see women more beautiful than yourself. You imagine him being attracted to them. You're drinking gasoline to stay warm.\\"  Unlike Phair, however, Bank can't buffer her lyrical sentences with music, and the words are imaginative but awkward.  It's not clear why they eventually break-up, except that his devotion is purportedly aimed at all women, not Jane specifically. I didn't quite buy it.  One other minor complaint: Jane Rosenal is sometimes sitcom glib--the funny lines need a rest sometimes. (We get it, we get it, she's a witty person!).  For all the excellent writing (\\"My devoted friend says,'I don't think you could have felt so strongly if he didn't feel the same way about you.' `I say, \\"How do you feel about Jeremy Irons\\"'\\") there are a few clunkers (\\"It occurs to me that I may not be the only butterfly whose wings flutter in the presence of his stamen.\\"  Well, maybe you like that line.)<br />Finally, there is the excellent title story.  Hearing from a friend that she's been trying to catch a man by swimming with him, rather than fishing with a hook and bait, she buys a self-help book, \\"How to Meet the Man You Want and Marry Him.\\" The two female authors, \\"Bonnie,\\" and \\"Faith,\\" become characters in the story, and Jane follows and argues with their advise over how to handle Robert, a (standard poodle loving!) soulmate whom she meets at a wedding.  Her guides to \\"hunting and fishing\\" advise her to play hard-to-get, because men \\"are predatory animals who enjoy the hunt.\\" Because of her self-doubt, Jane follows their persistent admonitions to a Pyrric victory, finding that her role-playing is about to lose her \\"the man I never hoped I could expect.\\"  While some reviewers have mentioned that Robert seems a bit one-dimensional, the story really belongs to Jane and her interior conversations with her \\"man-trapping\\" guides<br />The book is witty and smart, and captures the ineffable nature of falling in and out of love.  Other than the basic themes of love, commitment, and insecurities, it's not really much like \\"Bridget Jones.\\" Both books are enjoyable, but this has a little more substance. A fabulous book, warm, funny, and real.  Very highly recommended!d.  It's not clear why they eventually break-up, except that his devotion is purportedly aimed at all women, not Jane specifically.

(As one reviewer pointed out, they don't--there are hundreds of sports in which Blacks don't dominate). But the author believes it's time to lay all the cards on tha table, even if race and differential race performance make us uncomfortable.<br />One of the main problems is that Entine seems to think that science is a democracy; that all points of view deserve equal weight.  But scientific arguments are not equally valid, they differ in the quantity and, especially, the quality of the data that support them.  There is no reason, at this stage of our knowledge, that we should be equally open to all viewpoints. While Entine seems to pride himself on asking the \\"tough\\" questions, his attempt to depoliticize the debate fails because he seems to ignore his own assumptions and values. His attempt at value-free inquiry is either naiive or duplicitous.<br />  He is especially weak on the analogous question of whether IQ is genetically tied to race. He suggests that we keep an open mind about \\"The Bell Curve,\\" a book that has been roundly criticized for its selectivity, dubious social conclusions, and hidden political agenda (see \\"The Bell Curve Wars\\").  Speaking of which, what are we to make of a writer who calls Arthur Jenson a \\"respected scientist,\\" who slights America's greatest popular science author (Stephen Jay Gould) and who so disrespectfully paints Howard Gardner's concept of multiple (eight) intelligences.  (He doesn't even mention Guilford's pioneering work proposing well over 100 intelligences).<br />Such shoddy treatment of \\"The Bell Curve,\\" the most publicized book on race and performance in recent times, casts substantial  doubt on Entine's discussion and theories about the heritability of athletic ability. Nor does he tackle the sociobiological meaning of race and its validity problems (see the \\"Scientic American\\" editorial review above).<br />It's true that we should be unafraid to discuss racial issues, and I suppose this book will encourage debate. But that debate should be reasoned, grounded in  known facts, and taken very very seriously.  It's one thing to call for a national uncensored debate, it's quite another to popularize the issue (using Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan to sell books), to imply that all scientists' theories deserve the same consideration, and to make a very serious issue a matter for casual jokes: What are we to make of a book that concludes (perhaps  tongue in cheek) that maybe \\"white men can't jump.\\"  The issue, wherever it takes us, deserves more serious and scholarly treatment than it gets here. As one alternative I suggest Stephen Jay Gould's \\"The Mismeasurement of Man.\\" This book is not worth the money or effort.we should be unafraid to discuss racial issues, and I suppose this book will encourage debate.

Illustrated and written in the style of original authors, Margaret and H.A. Rey, this 1998 release finds George and the infamous man in the yellow hat visiting a chocolate factory.  When the yellow-hatted man tells George &quot;wait here while I buy these, and please stay out of trouble,&quot; you KNOW that George will do exactly the opposite.  After all, George is CURIOUS, and his inquiring personality and sweet tooth lead him deeper and deeper into the inner workings of the factory, where he gets into more trouble.  His quick hands and mouth save the factory from his own curiosity-inspired havoc, and George goes home happy and full.<br />While not as clever as some of the earlier books in the series, the chocolate factory setting is inspired. Page 10, for example, depicts seven different mouth-watering chocolates. Little ones will understand George's interest in the making of chocolates, and his accidental, temporary wrecking of the assembly line.  Again, I don't think it's quite up to the high standards of some of the other &quot;Curious George&quot; books.  Twenty-two pages, with understated watercolor and pencil illustrations on each page.	2001-04-15

The bus takes the kids inside a book about Physics, where they enter a page about a baseball field with no friction.  The kids learn about how throwing, running, and catching would work were there no friction.<br />Generally, the books are funny, have recognizable characters, and teach science principles in a clear, imaginative way. This book, however, was not as good as others I've read in the series: there is minimal use of &quot;miniaturization&quot; that makes the other books so clever and unique, the focus on friction is a bit too narrow, and the usually exciting escape from danger is on the tepid side.  Still, its 30 pages contain bad puns, demonstrations of  friction, and two friction experiments and the never-frazzled Ms. Frizzle.  It's a mildly entertaining and informative book.	2001-04-15

Books	5	14	16	N	N	Wherever There�s Magic and Make-Believe�	This is an almost encyclopedic description of the greatest \\"backstage\\" movie ever made (along with \\"Stage Door\\"), 1950's Oscar-winner &quot;All About Eve.&quot;  Believe the title: This is all about the movie, and people who haven't seen the movie or who don't like it will indeed find this stuffed with too much information.<br />That caveat aside, this is a superb book, taking both a lowbrow and highbrow analysis of the Joseph L. Mankiewicz scripted and directed film starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill, Thelma Ritter, Marilyn Monroe, Gregory Ratoff, and Hugh Marlowe. Author Sam Staggs takes us behind the on- and off-stage scenes, to deliver the subtext of the movie: The various meanings transacted among the text--the film itself--and its audience (including those who made the film). There are brawls, feuds, insults, lawsuits, legal challenges, large egos, and a Rashomon-like recollection of who said what to whom more than 50 years ago.<br />Staggs tells the real event on which \\"Eve\\" is based, and then traces its evolution from short story to film. (We later meet the \\"real\\" Eve Harrington, as Staggs turns sleuth). The book is juicy, but the prose is occasionally overripe: Drawing a flimsy parallel between the fire in his brother's film Citizen Kane, and the real fire that (much later) consumed a van filled with many of Joe Mankiewicz's belongings, Staggs writes: That final fire at Xanadu, and the later one that consumed the Mankiewicz moving fan, rhyme like a combustible couplet.\\"  Really now!  Fortunately, such purple prose is rare.  Staggs give you the dish on \\"the bitchiest movie ever made,\\" but he also dwells like a scholar on technical aspects of the film, including lighting, costumes, script revisions, editing, casting decisions, and art direction, to name a few.<br />There's an excellent section on the special meanings of the movie to some members of the gay subculture, and how it has influenced (and been influenced by) general culture as well (\\"Eve\\" was acted out in movie houses long before \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\\") Again, Staggs makes a deft transition between \\"hi-brow\\" and \\"low-brow\\" culture and criticism, the former represented by his command of film semiotics, the latter by his references to \\"Hollywood Babylon\\" and porn films influenced by the movie.<br />It's a fun and informative book, and I can't imagine any fan of the movie, or movies in general, not liking it. (But remember we're talking \\"fan\\" here).  With 16 pages of black and white photos, an index, and sidebars (e.g., \\"No [sic] Innuendos Please-We're Anglo-Saxon\\" is a half-page box showing the lines cut by censors in Massachusetts and in Australia.)

In this slim volume, each writes separate but intertwined memoirs about  their relationship  as friend, editor, and fan with the great bassist/composer/bandleader. Their memories are fond, warm, personal, and humorous; their affection and something like awe are evident throughout the book.<br />This was the period of such Mingus works as &quot;Pithecanthropus Erectus&quot; and &quot;Ah Um.&quot;  Both Coleman and Young followed Mingus to New York City, where at clubs like the Bohemia,  Mingus' &quot;Jazz Workshops&quot; (people pay to hear us practice), musicians such as Jacki Byard, Dannie Richmond, Jimmy Knepper, Jackie McLean  followed Mingus' spontaneously combusting arrangements. We get a glimpse of Mingus the musician, the writer, and general connoisseur of life. As Coleman puts it, I knew Mingus during &quot;his Shotgun, Bicycle, Camera, Witchcraft, Cuban Cigar, and Juice Bar periods, and was familiar with his Afro, Egyptian, English banker, Abercrombie and Fitch, Sanford and Son, and ski bunny costumes. I ate his chicken and dumplings, kidneys and brandy, popcorn and garlic . . . &quot;  There are several good clues to the puzzle of Mingus' autobiography &quot;Beneath the Underdog,&quot; a work which Coleman, among others, helped edit.  I recommend reading &quot;Mingus/Mingus&quot; before tackling his Joycean autobiography.<br />We also see the political Mingus, rightly protesting the treatment of black musicians, as well as racism and militarism  generally.  After all, this is the genius who wrote such pieces as &quot;Oh, Lord, Don't Let Them Drop That Atomic Bomb on Me (with the great line, &quot;don't drop it, bebop it&quot;), &quot;Remember Rockefeller at Attica,&quot; and the  great &quot;Fables of Faubus,&quot; which courageously lambasted the segregationist governor. Cole's memoir is perhaps the more literary of the two (Coleman is a writer), and gives us a very personal view of Mingus' profound effect.  Coleman may have been the closer friend and she offers some rarely heard and often humorous anecdotes. Both Coleman and Young knew Mingus for more than 20 years, and the book is rich with material recalling Mingus and the social and creative forces of  the period: For example, Mingus played Genghis Kahn in a &quot;psychedelic Western&quot; written by Coleman's husband and filmed at Timothy Leary's ranch. Mingus criticizes Leary's approach: &quot;You can't improvise on nothin', man. You gotta improvise on something.&quot;  The book is filled with Mingus' humor and anger and appetites; his idealism and his realism.  A titan of a man and at times, a study in contrasts, Mingus the subject  is as compelling as the music he composed. (No index, but you get Mingus' recipe for eggnog!)

(The moral is presented as a rhyme on the title page:  &quot;Grownups and cubs get quite a surprise when they see themselves through the others' eyes.&quot;)<br />The book opens with some very grumpy parents getting angry (and petty) with their kids: Brother: &quot;What eating him?&quot; Mother: &quot;...and furthermore, I'll thank you not to refer to your father as 'him.'&quot;  Five pages later, Father &quot;roars&quot; at brother, &quot;Food isn't supposed to be interesting...it's supposed to be food.&quot;<br />The kids, who &quot;had no doubt that their parents loved them, [but] they were a little difficult to get along with sometimes,&quot; then enact a play to show their parents what it all sounded like to them.  Fine, and there's a few nice lines about getting costumes ready, but then the adults give their kids the same medicine they received:  The next day, wearing oversized version of Brother and Sister's clothes, they complain, scream, jump up and down, and leave things strewn all over the living room.  Yes, sinking to the children's level is ALWAYS a mature, adult way to handle your kids. (Please note sarcasm here.)<br />It's not exactly harmful, nor does the book pretend to be a parent's guidebook, but I found this version of &quot;perspective-taking&quot; contrived and annoying. The book isn't very clever, and the pictures are flat and lacking in imagination. Only for a real Berenstain Bears fan.	2001-03-14

The book does not adequately explain the motives of the high school teacher who tries to steal an election from overachiever Tracy Flick. (The book is set in Tom Perrotta's favored region of New Jersey.) The movie adaptation (with Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon) portrays more fully developed characters, allowing one to feel and believe their emotions.  However, the book is better than the movie in some respects. Paul Warren, Tracy's main electoral rival, is much more perceptive, and--well--smarter, than the one-dimensional nick jock in the movie. His first-person narration is closest to the author's point of view, and it's a very effective portrayal.  Tracy Flick comes off as more sympathetic, although a little more self-aware too.<br />Paul and Tracy represent high school archetypes; Paul's sister, outsider Tammy (so vividly portrayed in the film) is not as bouyant here and her relationships not highlighted as well.  Still, the rapid switches between different first person accounts of chronologically overlapping scenes make this a Rashomen-lite narrative that is fast, light, and often funny.<br />The main problem is &quot;Mr. M.,&quot; the high school teacher who attempts to rig the election against Tracy.  We don't see the burn out, the conflicts between idealism and cynicism, and, especially, the self-loathing that Broderick (and the screenplay) brought to the film.  Because of this somewhat superficial treatment, his behavior is never provided the context or motivation to fully realize the tragi-comical themes underlying the humor and irony so effectively portrayed in the film.  Still, a quick fun read.	2001-02-26

Despite these \\"heavy\\" undertones, this is light reading at its best, full of distinct, interesting characters, humorous unexpected developments, and a brisk pace.<br />The story involves Dave Raymond, the 31-year old lead guitarist for \\"The Wishbones,\\" a wedding band in which Dave feels both stuck and exhilarated. He has his own pre-wedding anxieties, as he finally proposes to his high school sweetheart, and then worries that he will settle into a bland suburban life sans music.  At a gig, he meets Gretchen (nom de plume: Marlene Fragment!), an aspiring bohemian poet, who seems Dave's last chance at prolonging and preventing some touch choices.<br />Perrota is great at irony, and he almost overplays this, but the book moves so quickly that one doesn't mind.  Although some of the book covers familiar &quot;rites of passage&quot; decisions, there's some outrageous (and I've heard, fairly realistic) wedding scenes, an unexpectedly tense gig with an unusual audience, and the musical aspirations of the singer (think \\"Springtime for Hitler,\\" but in somewhat better taste.  I liked the comparable \\"High Fidelity\\" more; it better captures the depth of rock and roll obsession, but this is close--An appealingly light look at marriage, weddings, and some awful 70's music.

I think Paul Pacult's &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot; is the better book, however: The tasting notes seem more accurate, and the grading system gives you an idea of his opinion of one scotch versus another.  There is no such rating system here.<br />The notes are necessarily brief for a &quot;pocket guide&quot; and often describe only one vintage (e.g., a 12-year old).  However, the notes for the notorious Laphroaig (peat smoke, tar, diesel oil, seaweed, iodine, salt&quot;) don't state whether it's the 10-, 12-, or 15-year old that is being evaluated. All in all, however, the author, a renowned authority on whisky, knows his scotch, and conveys well the essential elements of nose, body, taste, and finish.<br />There is a fairly heavy emphasis on the industry, including a list of top selling brands, prices fetched at auction (!), and the transfer of distillery ownership.  There is a nice list of distilleries, locations, and telephone numbers for those planning a scotch tasting excursion, and a good (but dated) bibliography.  Recommended particularly for those who want a portable reference book, or who have a special interest in distillery history.	2001-02-10

Though limited to short anecdotes, jokes, and short but histories, the book, much like Gene Lees' great \\"Meet Me at Jim and Andy's, offers a whole pie of jazz life its intimate slices.<br />Crow provides a lot of jazz history to introduce the topically arranged anecdotes (e.g., Good Lines,\\" \\"On the Road,\\" \\"Beginnings,\\" \\"Hirings and Firings,\\" \\"Prejudice\\"). The lines and stories are very good, and give insights into personalities and jazz, in general.  There are one-liners:  \\"Shelley Manne gave an interviewer his definition of jazz musicians: `We never play anything the same way once,'\\" and longer stories such as the legendary fight between Juan Tizol and Charles Mingus on Ellington's bandstand (We get Tizol's and Mingus' versions of what happened, including Mingus' revealing recitation of what Duke told him afterwards about the fight \\"I congratulate you on your performance, but why didn't you and Juan inform me about the adagio you planned so that we could score it?.\\"<br />There are short sections focusing on one or two famous jazz musicians, such as Mingus, Armstrong, Miles Davis and John Coltrane, Bessie Smith,  \\"Fats\\" Waller, Dizzy, Bird, Eddie Condon and others, as well as funny stories about lesser known players: \\"[Joe] Puma dropped in at a small New York Club where Jim Rainey was working.  The club wasn't doing much business...there was a fire department sign on the wall... `OCCUPANCY OF THESE PREMISES BY OVER 116 PEOPLE IS UNLAWFUL.' Jimmy penciled neatly underneath: `AND UNLIKELY.'\\"<br />Sources include autobiographies, interviews, biographies, oral histories, and Crow's own experiences.  Under \\"Acknowledgements,\\" the book includes a great bibliography of jazz-related writings.  No pictures, but an index, and, as mentioned earlier, lots of information mixed in with the humor.  Very highly recommended.commended.	2001-02-02

Susan G. Purdy (former student at \\"Le Cordon Bleu\\" and \\"L'Ecole de Cuisine la Varennes\\" in Paris) is a master chef, whose previous book, \\"Let Them Eat Cake\\" won the Julia Child Award. Her number one criterion for these low-fat goodies is taste: \\"The recipes must stand on their own and taste wonderful, not `okay' because they are low fat.\\"<br />It's an easy yet complete guide to making low-fat sweets, with cooking tips on almost every page, enumerated instructions for each recipe, and notes on advance preparation, special equipment, and time requirements.<br />Her recipe for the delicious and usually cholesterol-heavy Tiramasu is a wonder.  Per serving, it has 341 calories (compared to 600 for her favorite non low-fat recipe), 7.8 g of fat (compared to 37 g), and 92 mg of cholesterol (compared to 243mg). Her lemon meringue recipe has half the fat and one-sixth the cholesterol of the usual by using non-fat butter, no egg yolks, and other healthy substitutions. There is a long, excellent chapter on nutrition and cooking, a list of recipes by dietary requirement (e.g., fat-free, lactose-free, reduced-sugar) and occasion (children; holidays). She includes also a humorous 4-pagesection called \\"quick-fix cover-up tricks\\" when recipes don't go as expected.<br />This is a fun, thorough, and delicious set of recipes. Ms. Purdy talks about the importance of reducing fat and cholesterol but never sounds preachy.  There's a guide to USDA food labels (for example, she explains the meaning of  \\"fat-free\\" on a label), a list of mail order suppliers, a bibliography, index, and some beautiful color pictures within the book's 389 pages.

Josephine Araldo, who \\"influenced a generation of American chefs,\\" was born in Brittany, studied at the Cordon Bleu in Paris, and, in 1924, moved to San Francisco. The book is divided into three sections reflecting her work and influences from these settings.  One simple and tasty recipe is for \\"Green Beans From the Brittany Coast\\" (&quot;Haricots Verts Cotes de Bretagne\\"); it combines blanched string beans, new potatoes, scallions, garlic, butter, parsley, and seasoning. Directions are clear but brief; for example, there is no instruction on how to \\"blanch\\" vegetables. This is probably a very simple procedure, but the author, Robert Reynolds (friend and student of Ms. Araldo) assumes you know the technique.  (Caution: Vegetarians and Bugs Bunny fans may also be turned off by the suggested accompaniment of braised rabbit.)<br />It's interesting to contrast the regional and perhaps historical differences among recipes for a particular vegetable; for example, \\"Cabbage and Rutabaga with Almonds\\" from Brittany (you may want to skip the two tablespoons of goose or duck fat), \\"Red Cabbage and Pears\\" from Paris, and \\"Cabbage with Apples and Gooseberries\\" (good with poached salmon) from her San Francisco days.<br />Collated by her friend, Chef Robert Reynolds (\\"Le Trou Restaurant Francais,\\" San Francisco), who also wrote fascinating regional and biographical notes for each section.  No nutritional information, but excellent brief comments on each recipe, an index, and some black and white reproductions of watercolors, and clear uncrowded typeset on thick luminous paper: Overall, a beautifully produced book.	2001-01-30

One of the best of the vegetarian cookbooks, this has delicious recipes (e.g., \\"Pasta with Greens and Ricotta\\"), and clear directions for relatively easy vegetarian fare.  There's an emphasis on the \\"fast and easy,\\" and each recipe has an estimated preparation time, often under half an hour.  Sometimes these estimates imply a cook with Olympian speed and efficiency, but with experience, preparation time is reduced.  For example, \\"Field Peas with Kale and Sweet Potatoes\\" requires boiling potatoes, and sauteing onions, kale, and peas. Total time is a reasonable 25 minutes. A nutritional analysis follows each recipe. Field Peas above has 142 calories, 6.9 G protein, 2.3G fat, 24.5 Carbohydrates, 19mg sodium, and 0 mg cholesterol.<br />There's no particular low-fat emphasis here: Boiled Polenta with Mushrooms and Cheese\\" has 15.6 g of fat per 8 oz. Serving, Moosewood Fudge Brownie have 9.3 grams per two-inch brownie, but there are several recipes with under 3 grams of fat per serving.<br />It's a very comprehensive book, with recipes for soups, quick breads, salads, sauces, main dish salads, grains, beans, pastas, fish, desserts, stews, stir-fries, pizza, and more. The book includes a guide to ingredients, and chapters on techniques, herbs, menu planning, and a list of recipes for kids, parties, vegans, and buffets.  Finally, there is a chapter called \\"Quantities,\\" so that you'll know with utter serenity that it takes 2 ½ cups of florets to get one pound of cauliflower.<br />For an emphasis on low-fat vegetarian cooking, take a look at the Moosewood Low-Fat Cookbook. Otherwise, this is an excellent cookbook for beginner or expert, and ranks with \\"Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone\\" as one of the best vegetarian cookbooks available.	2001-01-29
2126833:US	49600435	R2L8Z901MFRTOS	0195090810	735693784	The History of Jazz	Books	5	98	99	N	N	Burns Delivers the Pictures, but Giola Gives You the Text	Anyone purportedly writing a &quot;History of Jazz\\" faces a daunting task: A complex history of interwoven musical strands, the linkages and evolutions (sometimes skipping a generation), the geographic spread to Europe and elsewhere, the eventual fragmentation of jazz into diverse sounds and approaches, and the opinions of knowledgeable, rabid fans.<br />Ted Giola succeeds magnificently: This is the best single-volume history of jazz I've seen.  While not without some minor flaws (see below), this is a comprehensive, generally very well written, and intriguing story of the genesis and development of jazz.  It is a compelling story, and Giola writes without mythologizing jazz, or constantly needing to remind us that this is, indeed, art. The giants of jazz-- Armstrong, Ellington, Parker, Holiday, etc. are critiqued rather than lionized.<br />Giola proceeds through the now familiar African, American, African-American, and European roots of jazz that emanated first from New Orleans.  He traces its developmental routes through Chicago and New York, the Armstrong solo evolution, and the diverse &quot;territory bands&quot; such as those of Bennie Moten and Count Basie.<br />Fortunately, Giola does not limit himself to a strictly chronological narrative.  He interrupts the timeline with revealing excursions into topics such as the development of instrumental styles (e.g., piano, trumpet), and jumps ahead to show the impact of early influences on later styles (e.g., Lester Young and bebop).  He also pays attention to cultural, technological, and economic context, without letting these subtexts blare over the music.  Giola knows music from the &quot;inside&quot; as well as the outside, and his discussions of jazz technique and harmonic and rhythmic innovations are detailed and precise.  His deconstruction of various solos and styles is illuminating: Charlie Parker's \\"Indiana\\" is a version \\"where almost every bar features one or more altered tones-an augmented fifth, a major seventh played against a minor chord, a flatted ninth leading to a sharpened ninth...a textbook example of how bop harmonic thinking revolutionized the flow of the melodic line in jazz.\\"  Yet Giola is also astute in directing our attention to the \\"core of simplicity\\" ...the \\"monophonic melody statements\\" in bop.<br />Giola's critiques of various musicians are generally fair and accurate, and he discusses the famous as well as the overlooked.  Every jazz fan, however, will probably find some favorite musician given insufficient coverage, or will disagree with a Giola critique.  There's no mention of Carmen McCrae, about half a page on Sarah Vaughan, very little mention of European jazz, not much discussion of Miles Davis' or Basie's later work (\\"The Atomic Mr. Basie,&quot; for example).  For my tastes, there is not enough on Mingus' sidemen (other than Eric Dolphy and Rahsaan Roland Kirk) and he describes the Mingus Town Hall Concert as a fiasco. (Organizationally it was a disaster, but musically it succeeded.)  Giola's statement that \\"Mingus was the closest jazz has come to having its own Ezra Pound,\\" is baffling.  To a large degree, however, these are editorial  (the book is only 395 pages long), as well as critical decisions.  Not everyone would agree, as I do, with Giola's dismissive statement that Kenny G. \\"sold over $20 million of emaciated pseudo-jazz to a devoted audience.  A critic cannot and should not please everyone.<br />Giola commands our respect because of his thorough knowledge of jazz and its web-like variations and influences.  He knows his material well, whether it's the origins of jazz or the \\"Third Stream\\" and \\"Free Jazz\\" movements of relatively recent years.  I recommend this book very highly to both musician and non-musician alike, jazz aficionado and novice.  You may read the book as an introduction to jazz, or to achieve a greater synthesis of what you already know.  It may also serve as a springboard to more narrowly focused jazz writing, such as Rosenthal's \\"Hard Bop\\" or Lees' \\"Meet Me at Jim and Andy's.\\"  There is a general index, an index of songs and albums, 15 pages on recommended listening, eight black and white photos, some notes on sources, as well as suggestions for further reading. This book, and perhaps a copy of the \\"Penguin Guide to Jazz,\\" could easily serve as the core of a jazz lover's bookshelf.g, such as Rosenthal's \\"Hard Bop\\" or Lees' \\"Meet Me at Jim and Andy's.\\"  There is a general index, an index of songs and albums, 15 pages on recommended listening, eight black and white photos, some notes on sources, as well as suggestions for further reading.

Her book is informed by her personal experience that &quot;healthy foods serve no purpose if they aren't eaten.&quot; Woodruff states that this &quot;is the perfect book for those who want to reduce the fat in their diet, maximize their nutrition, and still enjoy great-tasting sweet treats.&quot;<br />After the introductory chapter on the importance of limiting fat, she presents 130 no- and low-fat recipes, often using creative fat substitutes such as fruit, yoghurt, buttermilk, corn syrup, jam, pruunes, sweet potatoes, and date sugar.  (She's also mindful of salt and cholesterol.)<br />The recipes vary from Cherry Apple Scones (0.3 grams of fat per serving) to Buttermilk Chocolate Cake (1.3 g), pumpkin gingerbread (0.3 g), Pear and Walnut Bundt Cake (0.7 g), Plum Delicous Bran Muffins (0.7 g), and old favorites like oatmeal raisin cookies (0.3 g).<br />As you can see above, the fat content is indeed low, which sometimes sacrifices the flavor and texture found in higher-fat recipes. (Though I think one reviewer here went a little too far in criticizing the taste).  This is a good beginner's book with a variety of recipes, and offers useful cooking tips, a list of stores selling low-fat ingredients, nice old-fashioned color photos, and an index.  For a little more flavor (and perhaps a little more fat?), take a look at &quot;Let Them Eat Cake.&quot; For those who want to eat their favorite sweet things with minimal fat, this is an excellent book.	2001-01-24

To top it off, let's have the \\"Rhubarb Tart with Orange Custard.\\"<br />Sound like something from the Michelin guide to Paris?  It's Deborah Madison's excellent new volume,\\" Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone.\\"  This book is more user-friendly than the author's \\"Greens Cookbook,\\" Dishes are easier to prepare and not as time consuming.<br />The book includes tips on various cooking methods, equipment, seasoning and sauces (apple pear chutney!), and over 1,300 recipes for delicious salads, sandwiches, soups, casseroles, vegetables, pastas, breads, desserts, and breakfasts. NOTE:  This is not a vegan cookbook (i.e., dairy is included), but there is little or nothing on fish.  It is also NOT a low-fat cookbook a la the Moosewood Low-Fat book. Unfortunately, there is no nutritional information, but again, this is a not a \\"Health\\" cookbook.  Still, I think some attention to dietary issues would have strengthened the almost-encyclopedia quality of the book.  The two paragraphs on salt, for example, delve only into matters of taste.  As another reviewer noted, the few color pictures are good, but not great.<br />Ms. Madison comments on almost every dish: what to look for in the ingredients, serving suggestions, and some notes on modifications.  This is a very comprehensive guide to cooking; for example, she describes 9 kinds of squash and 8 types of cooking oil! There is a very helpful extensive index.  If you're a beginning vegetarian, or one with certain dietary needs, you might want to begin with a more focused book.  For the seasoned veteran, however, this is a thorough and well-written collection of recipes that taste as delicious as they sound.	2001-01-24

If the story of jazz is best found in the music itself, this is, far and away, your best guide to CDs. IT is simply the best jazz review book available.<br />The authors have exceptionally good, eclectic tastes; I detected no particular biases here.  Other reviewers have complained a little about the relative emphasis on English and European performers. I found that this improved the coverage of jazz, and did not feel that American performers were slighted. Besides, these performers are excellent, perhaps underrated in America, and often record alongside musicians from many countries!<br />The authors clearly explain their rating system, and there is a valuable emphasis on the sound quality of the recordings. Excellent notes on personnel and dates of recording: This is important because publishers seem to constantly repackage their jazz CDs, sometimes the only way to know what you've got is to compare personnel and dates.<br />Another strength here is the biographies of the performers.  There's lots of detail, and, as in the reviews, the authors don't refrain from fully critiqueing the records. Unfortuantely, this new edition does not have the small section on compilation CDs (i.e., Special limited-time gatherings of great musicians, such as the All-Star Metronome Band.  Perhaps these are no longer in print, or they are now listed under the principle player(s), at any rate, I preferred the prior method of listing these separately.)<br />I think the reviews are fair and insightful. Of course, you'll disagree with some of them, but this is really an excellent guide to jazz musicians and their output.  Their choice of musicians is thorough and appropriate (scant attention is paid to &quot;light&quot; jazz/pop artists such as Kenny G., etc., favoring instead performers ranging from Armstrong and Basie, bebop and big band, to contemporary musicians like Metheny and Krall.  The only question is whether you should wait for the next edition.  I recommend buying every edition (if you can), new mixes, box sets, and re-done CDs are, perhaps unfortunately because of the confusion, coming out all of the time. But between this and the last edition (despite my one reservation above), this will map better onto what's available.

It also describes the relationship between mother and daughter, husbands and wives, and the Sidda's professional and personal future as she retreats to the Olympia Peninsula, trying to understand her fear of love through the stories and memorabilia of her mother's scrapbook.<br />These flashbacked stories are the heart of the book, as Viv and her three close friends, who together make up the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, embark on various rites of passage as they grow up in the 1930's and 1940's. There are some hilarious scenes, reminiscent of Mark Twain, including a trip to see the premiere of \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" a Shirley Temple look alike contest, and climbing naked into the town water tower.  The warmth and loyalty of the four Ya-Yas, extending from childhood to their 70's is heartwarming and rare.  As Sidda goes through both the pleasures and pains of her mother's upbringing, her self-analysis takes her through her own memories of life with Viv.<br />A few complaints: The loyalty and personalities of the Ya-Yas are somewhat exaggerated, at times straining credulity. And, lest we forget that the fun-loving, generous, idiosyncratic mother also beat her child, we are constantly reminded (in redundant one-liners) about the physical and emotional impact of the belt on Sidda's skin.  As a narration of self-analysis, realism is sometimes sacrificed for storytelling and emotional pull.<br />But this is not a guide for the perplexed; it is a splendid confection (albeit layered with pathology) about the love of friendship, about memory and forgiving, and about intergenerational ties and the need for boundaries.  A delicious summer read; highly recommended!	2001-01-05

The metaphor of the bridge--the conduit to both the past and the future--figures prominently in this story of a Boston architect torn between his ongoing \\"mid-life\\" crisis and his energetic, passion-filled past.<br />The story contains some heavy-handed symbolism (e.g., the bridge), melodramatic action (\\"With one [hand] he threw down the window and with the other--still standing behind her--he drew her back against him), and awkward phrasing: \\"'He was simply the most tremendous response to stimuli I have ever known.'\\"<br />Still, the story moves along well, and there is an interesting Henry James-like contrast of Europe and America.  The beginning nicely portrays the Boston upper class, and the dramatic conclusion includes passages of great strength and imagination.  It is in this last chapter, especially, that her skills are most evident.  Willa Cather is the Pulitzer Prize winning author of \\"O Pioneers!\\" \\"My Antonia,\\" and other great works.  Definitely recommended for those with an interest in her work.	2000-11-15

In just 220 pages, bookshop owner Sylvia Beach, owner of the bookstore &quot;Shakespeare and Company,&quot; paints a vivid portrait of the social, cultural, and especially , in Paris.<br />The store opened in November 1919, offering works of T.S. Elliot, Joyce, Chaucer, and others, a variety of literary reviews,  and photographs of Wilde and Whitman. It ran first as kind of lending library, and almost immediately the many native and expatriate writers of Europe were borrowing books--and giving her their own new writings.  Very early customers included Gide, Maurois, American poet Robert McAlmon , &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Pound, &quot; and the following couple:<br />&quot;Not long after I opened my bookshop, two women came walking down the rue Dupuytren.  One of them, with a very fine face, was stout, wore a long robe, and, on her head, a most becoming top of a basket.  She was accompanied by a slim, dark whimsical woman: she reminded me of a gypsy.  They were Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas.&quot;<br />Sylvia Beach writes clearly, candidly, and fondly of her many visitors and friends in prewar Europe, especially the 1920's ( she and her friends dismantled the shop when the Nazis threatened to confiscate her books in 1941).  She evokes an entire era though richly told and plentiful anecdotes. She writes of  encounters and friendships with such notables as Sherwood Anderson, Katherine Anne Porter, Satie, Bryher, H.D., Paul Valery, Valery Larbaud, D. H. Lawrence, and Hemingway (at the end of the book, Hemingway  liberates &quot;the wine cellar at the Ritz&quot; (Hemingway's words) as he and his company try to rid the Rue l'Odeon of the remaining German snipers.  Perhaps her closest relationship was with James Joyce, and she tells many stories, both amusing and sad, about him. (Sylvia Beach  published the first edition of the highly controversial  &quot;Ulysses&quot; in 1922.)  The book feels intimate; one feels as if M. Beach has let one into her confidence. Highly enjoyable, fascinating, personal--and ultimately thrilling.ach has let one into her confidence. Highly enjoyable, fascinating, personal--and ultimately thrilling.	2000-11-11

Not only does it introduce young readers (and parents not familiar with the &quot;Negro Leagues&quot;) to great, almost legendary African-American players including Leroy &quot;Satchel&quot; Paige, Josh White, James &quot;Cool Papa&quot; Bell, Josh Gibson, and Jackie Robinson (as well as the Cuban-born Martin Dihigo, Jose Mendez, and Crisobal Torriente), but it explains segregation with facts and an appropriate tone of compassion and a sense of injustice:<br />&quot;Before about 1950, if you were black and wanted to earn a living playing baseball, you were not allowed to play on the same team with white ballplayers. Prejudiced team owners, encouraged by bigoted players, established racist rules that prevented black athletes from playing in the major leagues, regardless of their skills.&quot;<br />The book also explains how Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier when Branch Rickey hired him to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. The book mentions the insults that Robinson endured (though not detailing them) as he paved the way for other early major league stars who came from the Negro Leagues (for example, Roy Campanella, Monte Irvin, Ernie Banks, and Elston Howard).<br />This initial integration spelled the eventual end of the Negro Leagues. Still, in one poignant quotation from Gene Benson, an outfielder with the Bacharach Giants and the Philadelphia Stars, famed baseball author Lawrence Ritter captures the accomplishments of these often unheralded players: &quot;We never thought about the major leagues. We never dreamed that it would come true. But I know we were the pioneers. Without our league, where would Robinson have come from? If we weren't out there suffering and struggling, they wouldn't have any blacks in there now.&quot;<br />Although written primarily for kids, I would have liked to see photos (in addition to the excellent drawings) of the players, and, when known, their stats. For a more detailed look at the game, try Robert Peterson's great &quot;Only the Ball Was White.&quot; This, however, is an excellent (if somewhat too brief) look at an era when &quot;The National Pastime's&quot; most prestigious (and highest paying) league excluded players on the basis of race.a more detailed look at the game, try Robert Peterson's great &quot;Only the Ball Was White.&quot; This, however, is an excellent (if somewhat too brief) look at an era when &quot;The National Pastime's&quot; most prestigious (and highest paying) league excluded players on the basis of race.	2000-11-09

Its archetype practitioner was trumpeter Lee Morgan, killed outside a nightclub in January 1972 by his lover.  Influenced by boppers such as  Fats Navarro and Dizzy Gillespie, Morgan and other hard boppers developed a style emphasizing minor keys, a &quot;dark&quot; mood, slurs, and half-valve effects.  Morgan's most popular number in the idiom was the huge 1964 hard bebop/R&amp;B  hit &quot;The Sidewinder.&quot;<br />Hard bop is introduced here through the prism of Lee Morgan: Morgan helped develop the style as an alternative to bop's successor, cool jazz, as developed, in part, by Gerry Mulligan and Miles Davis, and hard bop began to fade with his murder.  But the book tackles more than Morgan, and, in fact, more than hard bop: It's a fascinating account of the various musical streams colliding--sometimes melding-- in the 10 years between 1955 and 1965.<br />Rosenthal traces the evolution of hard bebop as bop declined (&quot;bebop . . . had turned into something of a straitjacket . . .  Many of its best practitioners were dead, and others . . . were in decline&quot;). Musicians looked to R &amp; B to revive bop, and a new &quot;more emotionally expressive and more formally flexible style began to emerge.&quot; Rosenthal looks at the expressions of hard bop in such diverse artists as Sonny Rollins, the soulful Horace Silver (&quot;The Preacher&quot;), Cannonball Adderley, organist Jimmy Smith (&quot;Midnight Special&quot;), Jackie MacClean, and, to a lesser degree, Art Farmer, Andrew Hill, Mingus, and some of the pre-1965 John Coltrane (e.g., with Miles on &quot;Cookin'&quot;).  Rosenthal perceptively notes that hard bebop was a &quot;complicated set . . . of interlocking tendencies,&quot; rather than a static, easily defined style.<br />I enjoy this book because it explores a somewhat brief phenomenon, and shows how it developed, flourished, and then gave way to new elements.  The writing is crisp,  intelligent, energetic, and full of  illustrative anecdotes that illuminate and entertain (not the dry pedantic  treatise one might expect on this rather narrow topic).  Rosenthal  shows the connections between various elements of jazz, and presents it as a living, evolving, powerful force. Eleven chapters following the introduction, no pictures.  Very highly recommended to jazz fans of any stripe.The writing is crisp,  intelligent, energetic, and full of  illustrative anecdotes that illuminate and entertain (not the dry pedantic  treatise one might expect on this rather narrow topic).

The book's extraordinary  photos and well-researched narrative give a fond but unsentimental portrait of  jazz history; of brilliant music played against  a backdrop of  hardship and white expropriation.<br />The book is a delight: A museum of rare and evocative materials from turn of the century Storyville, New Orleans (the oldest picture is of  jazz legend Buddy Bolden's Band circa 1894) up to around 1990 (with posters of recent movies like &quot;Bird&quot; and &quot;Round Midnight&quot;); however, the bulk of the collection is from the early New Orleans days through bebop.  We see the very young Louis Armstrong in the &quot;Colored Waif's Home&quot; brass band, and later with his &quot;Hot Five&quot; group in 1925, and then a racist ad for Armstrong's OKEH recording of &quot;St. James Infirmary.&quot;  Numerous pictures of jazz in Europe, featuring two Django Reinhardt album covers, a &quot;Jazz Illustrated&quot; article about a 1949 Paris concert with Sidney Bechet, Charlie Parker, Tad Dameron, and &quot;Hot Lips&quot; page (all of  whom were subject at the time to a British protectionist ban on foreign musicians), and numerous memorabilia of British jazz bands.  (There's a disproportionate amount of material on English jazz; the book was originally published in London).<br />Bunk Johnson is featured on the cover of &quot;The Jazz Record,&quot; hailed as a &quot;the last important link between the present [the 1940's] and the fabulous Buddy Bolden . . .&quot; Superb pictures (but too few) from the bebop and post-bebop periods, including the young Dizzy Gillespie, a close-up of Monk, and album covers for Bird.  There's also a ticket from the &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot; series and an English &quot;programme&quot; for an Ellington concert, but only a two page section on &quot;Women in Jazz,&quot; featuring photos and albums of vocalists Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Bessie Smith and Ella Fitzgerald.<br />The book has its problems. As mentioned previously, there is far too much emphasis on British jazz, the books devotes almost an equal number of pages to &quot;Jazz Consolidates in Britain&quot; as it does to the Swing Era. The boppers, the Cotton Club, Miles, etc. are also not well-represented; this is not a history of jazz.  But, overall, this is an eye-catching assortment of &quot;printed ephemera and collectibles.&quot;  With a special section on &quot;jazz in print&quot; (a guide to jazz magazines), jazz-related  literature, ephemera collections (e.g., the Louisiana State Museum), a bibliography, and index.

Miles' autobiography reveals a hardworking, supremely talented musician who challenged himself continually as he, time after time, reinvented jazz.  Yet Miles Davis is full of contradictions; the victim of racism; he rails, at times, against whites, yet plays with and respects them. His attitudes and behavior toward women can be appalling, yet he had a tender, generous side, and admits (and also denies) his faults.  As far as I can tell,  Miles is Miles in this book, and if there are contradictions in his story, it's because there are contradictions in the man.<br />Some people have complained that there is not enough analysis of  his music in the book, but your ears will tell you more than any technical explanation.  He talks of his early days at Juilliard, skipping the school to play with Bird and others in New York, his courageous &quot;cold turkey&quot; quitting of heroin, his abuse by police, and the various bands and movements he led.  Lots of amusing (and tragic) anecdotes, comments on other musicians, insights into his wide-ranging tastes, and interesting sidelights (he and Jimi Hendrix almost made an album together).<br />Miles Davis is candid, and quite generous with his use of obscenities--but no matter. He tells it like he sees it.  One gets the impression that if the man is flawed, and his recollections perhaps self-serving at times, he at least is being as honest as he can be with himself.  We really don't know, just as we can't really know all the &quot;true facts&quot; in any autobiography.<br />His music is unspeakably beautiful, and  one may wonder how his music seems to transcend both his  victimization and his own prejudice.  But then, maybe that is our bias: To try to fit Miles into some definition that would explain these seeming incongruities.  Miles defies categorization, and that is the challenge and the beauty of the book: To take it on its own terms, to accept the complexity of the man, flaws and all (as we are all flawed), and then to be thankful that Miles smiled on us. This  is a landmark of autobiography, transposing  the seen and the felt.  The book makes you think, and would be an excellent choice for a book club or  classroom. Very highly recommended, one of the best books ever written about one musician's personal journey.e man, flaws and all (as we are all flawed), and then to be thankful that Miles smiled on us.

It traces three generations of baseball fans, growing with the game, and their encounters with George Herman \\"Babe\\" Ruth.  Baseball changes more slowly than the events around it: war, the Depression, marriage, birth, technology.<br />The love of baseball is transmitted from father to son to granddaughter, and it is in that slow but certain transmission that the author conveys the beauty of the game.  No other sport treasures its history so much.  No other major sport is so unconstrained (at least, theoretically) by time.<br />Donald Hall has written an unhurried look at baseball, growth, and decline.  We meet the young Babe Ruth as a star southpaw for the Red Sox, then follow (with the New Hampshire family portrayed here) repeated years of father-son baseball games, rooting for the Babe as he keeps breaking his own home run record, and then, briefly, the Babe's last, uncompleted year in baseball.  Between the lines we see the dimmest outlines of a flawed man.  The book is both a sentimental evocation of a New England family's enchantment with baseball, and an unstudied meditation on the passage of time.<br />Of course, the above is from an adult perspective.  Elementary school kids (and older) will enjoy the depiction of times past, the two encounters with the young and the older Babe, and, most of all, the outstanding illustrations by Barry Moser.  Like baseball, it can seem a little slow, but if you have the time and the inclination, the book will envelop you like an old familiar glove.	2000-10-30

(But not every time....)	Anyone who enjoys the beauty and mechanics of fine fountain pens will enjoy this volume. The book contains dozens of beautifully photographed pens, most from 1900-1940, a golden age for fountain pens.  The intricately engraved and filigreed metals and hand-painted plastics are well presented, with brief descriptions of each pen.  Most of the pens are beyond the budget of anyone but the most serious collector, but their allure is captured well.<br />The emphasis on collecting rare pens limits its scope and appeal: Interesting (but less valuable) pens of the post-World War II period are largely ignored.  However, this is one of the few book s on pens, and the beautiful merging of form, function, and fanciful embellishment is evident on every page. There is a brief history of fountain pens, focusing mainly on mechanical advances.  Some of this description is too dense, and the inclusion of diagrams from the period is interesting but not very instructive for the non-collector. Includes names of dealers (and even fountain pen clubs), a guide to what is repairable in a used pen, and histories of pen manufacturers. Recommended especially for collectors, and generally for people interested in how design and craft can elevate the aesthetics of an everyday object.	2000-10-20

The entire volume is introduced briefly (16 pages); each major work has a short preface as well. Not surprisingly, such brevity omits the many interpretations of Joyce's works, and much background material.  But this is a good get-your-feet-wet volume: An introduction to the major themes and styles of Joyce that can be approached by readers of varying experience.<br />&quot;Dubliners&quot; is easily comprehended at first reading (although the reader may choose to pursue its many layers by reading books that focus on interpretation), and may encourage the extra effort (and resulting pleasures) sometimes required for the other material.  The inclusion of a few chapters from &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; afford a sampling of the author's more &quot;difficult&quot; books.  I don't think the reader will come away with an appreciation of the total book (how could one?), but will gain some familiarity with Joyce's more complex works.<br />Should you buy this compact, thick, version, or the works individually?  I think there are two groups to whom the book will appeal: The reader who wants a fairly comprehensive introduction to Joyce, and the Joyce-fan who knows he or she would like a portable collection. Both types will forfeit some ease of reading (the print is small, but surprisingly clear), the complete text of the longer books, and literary \\"decoding\\" and criticism for the convenience and savings of one volume.  For these readers, this volume is highly recommended.	2000-10-05

The premise is wonderfully absurd  (Franken runs for President on the single issue of lowering ATM fees), and Franken presents the material in a variety of formats: Excerpts from his \\"autobiography\\" (\\"The Courage to Dare\\"), transcripts of political chat shows, and selected material from his speeches and diary.  Pages 3-4, for example, include a letter to Chief Justice Rehnquist, asking if he'll appear for a photo for the cover the book. Franken offers to reimburse him for \\"off-peak train fare,\\" and then asking for free legal advice.<br />But then Franken destroys the readers' trust in his cheeky humor and insight by making himself thoroughly unlikable in the remaining 200-some pages.  Rather than posing as the politician you love to hate, candidate Franken is merely a juvenile prankster, puerile and unfunny.  The sex and drug jokes, the cheap shots at public figures, and the sexist and other offensive escapades are grade school quality and repetitive.  They are so unlikely that-as satire-Franken's implicit commentary on the hypocrisy of politicians and the flaws of the electorate has no wit or insight.  Instead, he offers an implausible figure with nowhere to go satirically or as straight-ahead comedy.  The net effect is a mostly unfunny ego-trip that quickly loses its initial appeal.	2000-10-05

This superb book sparkles with both scholarship and wit.  Much like Thomas Kuhn did in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,&quot; Ms. Marler describes the external determinants of acceptance and repute.  Ms. Marler traces the beginnings of the circle of writers, painters, designers, and other intellectuals (including John Maynard Keynes, Vanessa Bell, Lytton Strachey, E.M. Forster, and Roger Fry) known as Bloomsbury and, especially, its most famous literary member, Virginia Woolf.  Bloomsbury and Woolf go in and out of fashion, sometimes together, sometimes separately, as various critical camps interpret the  &quot;real&quot; meaning of her work.<br />Passing through a decades-long  literary gauntlet, Virginia Woolf's works are rudely characterized and discarded, rediscovered and reinterpreted, revived and revered (although some form of backlash seems never  far away).  Marler traces how Woolf's writing is subjugated to various forms of  literary criticism and theory: Structuralism, post-structuralism, feminism, new criticism, psycho-biography, and, one is tempted to say, pseudobiography. In fact, after reading &quot;Bloomsbury Pie&quot; the  reader may ponder what biography can realistically achieve. Marler also brings fresh insight into how familiarity may  color a critic's evaluation of a subject, and how familial and proprietary considerations  may clash with needs of scholars and sellers.<br />While the author refers to Woolf's genius, the book's primary purpose is not to critique Woolf's literature or place in history, but rather to trace how literary history is forged within social, cultural, and financial contexts.  It is to the author's enormous credit that she applies the same high rigorous standards to all Woolfian critics.  (Perhaps it is this objectivity and specific purpose that irked some Amazon reviewers here.)  In direct contradiction to many of these scholars, Marler seems to have no axe to grind, no theory  to which the facts must fit.  In the final section, she traces, with measured cynicism, the intersection of art and commerce, showing who benefits from Bloomsbury's ever-changing meanings. (As Clive Bell observed, reporters could not decide whether the term referred to &quot;a point of view, a period, a gang of conspirators or an infectious disease.&quot; p. 275).<br />If these sorts of ideas and issues appeal to you, or if you have some curiosity about &quot;The Group,&quot; I strongly recommend this excellent volume.  &quot;Bloomsbury Pie&quot; is well-researched, evenhanded, and particularly well written.  Marler writes incisively and with great humor;  commenting on one critic's smug, vitriolic dismissal of Bloomsbury, she observes: &quot;It is easy to pick apart this sort of review, which lays its writer open like a filleted fish (p. 32).&quot;  Although not necessary, some  familiarity with the group's works will help the reader fully appreciate the many  rewards  of this brilliant, insightful, and entertaining book. Definitely worth looking for!.  In the final section, she traces, with measured cynicism, the intersection of art and commerce, showing who benefits from Bloomsbury's ever-changing meanings.

Very irritating, for serious tourists and new  arrivals.&quot;<br />Do not fret.  Within a few pages both the initiate and  the expert will be won over.  This is a superb book in the Wooster-Jeeves  series, full of Wooster's malapropisms, preposterous schemes, boggled  literary quotes (&quot;the snail was on the wing and the lark on the  thorn--or rather, the other way around . . . &quot;) and memories of  hi-jinks at Eton and the Drones' club.  Then there is Jeeves, the  gentleman's gentleman, aware of his subordinate position to Wooster,  but--as admitted by all-- possessing a greater knowledge of &quot;the  psychology of the individual.&quot; Consider the following exchange between  Bertie and the ever-troubled Augustus &quot;Gussie&quot; Fink-Nottle:  &quot;this is frightful, Bertie.&quot;  &quot;Not too good, no.&quot;  &quot;I'm in the soup.&quot; &quot;Up to the thorax.&quot; &quot;What's to  be done?&quot; &quot;I don't know.&quot; &quot;Can't you think of  anything?&quot; &quot; Nothing. We must put out trust in a higher  power.&quot; &quot;Consult Jeeves, you mean?&quot;<br />The book's events  appear to take place soon after those described in &quot;Right Ho,  Jeeves,&quot; and before &quot;Joy in the Morning.&quot;  As mentioned  above, one is easily drawn into the humorous misadventures of our  protagonists and their screwball plotting against Gussie's fianc&eacute;'s father  and his  neo-Fascist friend, Spode, modeled after England's Sir Oswald  Mosley. Written in 1938, even the humorous hand of Wodehouse touches on the  threat of the fascist &quot;black shorts&quot; (the shirts, apparently, had  already been taken).<br />Lighthearted fare, but perfectly crafted by a master  of modern farce. This book is simply a delight, a compote of impossibly  funny personalities sweetened with a meringue of wit and satire. P.G.  Wodehouse, along with those other two-initialed humorists of the early to  mid-20th century (E.B. White, S.J. Perelman, A.J. Leibling) is one of our  most treasured writers.

The authors illuminate Irish colloquialisms  (&quot;I blow him out about you;&quot; explained here as &quot;I make him  feel proud (or vain) of our acquaintance),  as well as long entangled  references within  inner dialogue and narrative.  It expands one's  appreciation of &quot;Ulysses&quot; (and Joyce's genius), but it can also  slow down the pleasure of reading and just enjoying the sounds of it.<br />I  suggest that one use the Annotations to enhance, as opposed to impede,  one's enjoyment of the book; one need not investigate every one of the  twists and turns in Joyce's complex referential labyrinth. It's also fun to  read the Annotations after reading a chapter of Ulysses, and compare one's  prior impressions with one's (now almost encyclopedic) decoded version.  Some will also enjoy just the vast amount of information contained here and  read it out of sequence, or even  long after reading  &quot;Ulysses.&quot;<br />There's an introductory  overview of the book and  its context, and each chapter includes a comparison to the Greek &quot;The  Odyssey.&quot;  However, the bulk of the book is devoted to very thorough  explanations of the text.  The authors note that they walk the tricky line  between explanation and interpretation, I think they succeed in emphasizing  the former.  This book does not provide lengthy interpretations of the  themes and literary devices abounding in Ulysses--that is not its intent.  Rather, it is a well-written translator of the words and general structure.<br />Annotations are keyed to the 1984 edition of Ulysses, the standard 1961  Random House edition, and the Modern Library and Vintage editions.  The  revised &quot;Annotations&quot; contains over a thousand corrections and  additions to the first edition.

I think the key to  enjoying--rather than just finishing--the book is that it can be read on  many levels. One can choose to decode every historical, literary, and  religious allusion, the staggering play of words, and sometimes barely  comprehensible inner dialogue.  I recommend decoding these  selectively--they do add meaning and humor--but to also read this as a kind  of tone poem, in which language itself is celebrated and elaborated, with  passages of great humor and sympathy. A non-slavish interpretation of the  book, enables one to laugh (out loud, even) at the rich humor, to identify  with the struggles of every-person Leopold Bloom, and to savor, Zen-like,  the sound soup without total comprehension.  In addition to Joyce's mastery  and subversion of the language, there are larger issues: A liberal critique  of ethnocentrism, nationalism, dogmatism, and vanity.  Criticized by some  as degrading the human spirit (see Jeffrey Segall's &quot;Joyce in  America&quot; for a very good review of critical reactions), it is really a  celebration of it, finding dignity and soul in the flaws and triumphs of  the &quot;common&quot; person.<br />I can also recommend some books to  negotiate the complexities of the book, especially &quot;Ulysses  Annotated&quot; (by Don Gifford with Robert J. Seidman), &quot;The Ulysses  Guide&quot; (Nicholson), &quot;James Joyce: A to Z&quot; (Fargnoli and  Gillespie), and &quot;Ulysses, Portals of Discovery&quot; (McCarthy).  (All  of these available at Amazon.)  While I kept the Gifford and Seidman book  handy, and think it enhanced my appreciation of &quot;Ulysses,&quot;it is  definitely not necessary to solve every allusion and ambiguity.

The  \\"Telephone Booth Indian,\\" for example is a man or woman so poor as to not  have an office; so poor, in fact, as to not have a \\"nickel with which to  make a telephone call, and so must wait in the booths until another fellow  calls him.&quot;<br />Among Leibling's most successful entrepreneurs are the  two men who put on shows at Fairs and Exhibitions. They drop an intended  religious display because, \\"Rogers says, without any intended disrespect,  `the nuns would not play ball with us.'\\"  Liebling is attuned to social  forces at work in these late depression years; for example, the minority  group boxing amateurs fighting for $15 watches, and still having an easier  time making a living than the professionals.  And, in great detail,  Leibling describes the occupants of the composite \\"Jollity Building,\\"  including the telephone booth Indians (those without offices), heels (those  who rent offices for $10 to $12.50 a month) and tenants (those who lease  offices, but who often rotate back to \\"Indians\\" within a short time).  \\"Heels are often, paradoxically, more affluent than the official lessees of  larger offices\\" who often share desk time and name on the office door time,  since the manager allows only one official lessee. They get around this by  having their names painted and taped to the door during their scheduled  time.  \\"One two-desk office ... may serve as headquarters for four theatrical  agents, a band leader, a music arranger, a manager of prize fighters, and a  dealer in pawn tickets.\\"<br />Liebling provides a wonderfully rich  lexicography here as well, such as the two show producers who explain that  they do not provide \\"hokum\\" to the masses, but \\"gonk.\\"  \\"Gonk is hokum with  raisins in it...gonk is what we do.\\" Liebling writes with detail, vigor, and  affection.  This talent, along with his socioeconomic insight, gives  dignity to these people and to Liebling's dry wit: These are people doing  what they can do in difficult times.  I was reminded a bit of Woody Allen's  \\"Broadway Danny Rose\\" which similarly chronicles those on the fringe.  At  first, I pitied those people, but Allen, like Liebling, shows that they do  not pity themselves (not that there isn't an underlying injustice and  inequality portrayed here). Liebling's humorous book shows great insight  into their struggles, and an appreciation of how they creatively (and,  sometimes, illegally) negotiate their needs both because of, and, in spite  of, the American entrepreneurial dream.

(I didn't see the recent movie based on it, but, from what I've heard, it  doesn't do justice to the book.) The book can be read on several levels: A  tragicomedy of style over substance; a symbolic, psychodynamic portrait; or  a twisted travelogue. At any level, it is an astonishingly gripping  suspense, with unexpected but plausible twists and turns  throughout.<br />Thomas Ripley is the psychopath who forges an identity by  assimilating the envied elements of others.  Both his idealized self and  his self-loathing are projected onto others, with disastrous results.  His  &quot;talent&quot; lies in his chameleon-like ability to change his  identity. He purges his self-loathing by seeing others as common and  mediocre, and becomes a heroic-other through his gift for imitation,  deceit, and ingratiation.  He is a gifted actor, but acting is his only way  of &quot;knowing&quot; himself.<br />This is suspense at its finest. Like a  Hitchcock movie, the book has you asking yourself,  &quot;What will he  do?&quot; and then, &quot;Will he get away with it?&quot; Highsmith, who  also wrote &quot;Strangers on a Train,&quot; (later made into a Hitchcock  film) grabs your attention from page one and never lets up.	2000-08-28

Pleasant enough, but P.G.  Wodehouse masterfully parodies the upper crust and their sometimes foolish  pretenses as he skewers one Bertram \\"Bertie\\" Wooster (\\"A lesser man, caught  in this awful snare, would no doubt have ceased to struggle; but the whole  point about the Woosters is that they are not lesser men.\\"); often through  the verbal and psychological ingenuity of  \\"Jeeves,\\" the almost obedient  servant who masters the master  (\\"I fear, sir, that I was not entirely  frank with regard to my suggestion of ringing the fire bell\\").<br />Wodehouse  (who belongs with those other two-initialed humorists of the era, A.J.  Leibling, S.J. Perelman, and T.E. White) created icons and, perhaps, an  entire genre through Bertie and Jeeves. The dialogue is, as they say,  splendid: Droll and dry, understated yet preposterous.  Perhaps nowhere  else have the strictures of etiquette been exposed with such wit:  \\"A touch  of salmon?\\" \\"Thank you\\" \\"With a suspicion of salad?\\" \\"If you please.\\"  Wodehouse manages this satire through the first-person narrative of the  object satirized-no mean feat, what?  (You may find yourself uttering  Wodehousian English phrases for a few days after reading this.)  The plot  is a bedroom farce without the bedroom, with lots of the usual twists and  turns, but the ending is a little too neat. One reads Wodehouse, however,  mostly for his delicious language, his assortment of odd, engaging (and  oddly engaged) personalities, and, above all, his adroit sense of humor and  timing.  Right ho! Highly recommended.	2000-07-28

The formerly outrageous implausibility now seems  too deliberate, almost scripted for a series of five-minutes scenes (and  &quot;Strip Tease&quot; did become an awful movie), the sleazy villains and  virtuous heroes are now predictably offbeat, tenacious, and plain lucky.  We can forgive the manipulations on a first encounter, he's a good and  clever author taking you on a gravity-defying roller coaster.  But we're a  little more leery with this outing, and the farcical is supplanted too  often by the expedient.  Again, he's such a good writer that you want to go  along with him, but after a while, it's a bit too felicitous.<br />In  &quot;Strip Tease,&quot; the characters are, for the most part, either good  people in unfortunate situations, or bad people in fortunate ones. The  heroine, while appealing and feisty, is still somewhat of a cliche--the  whore with a heart of gold--only she's not a whore, she's a stripper, and  she's her own stripper too, refusing to do table or lap dances.  And, if  that weren't enough, she's doing this all to pay lawyer's fees to regain  custody of her daughter. Here she is, a former FBI assistant, smarter than  anyone around her, can type 70 words a minute, and only this job will pay  the attorney?  A job,  no matter how how she limits it,  that isn't likely  to win many points in future custody battles. Makes for a fun novel, what  with the easy target of a sleazy (but not too!) strip joint, a violent (but  good-hearted) bouncer, and mostly good ole' boy customers, but not a very  plausible one.<br />Again, this might work better in a pure farce, but the  multiple murders, child endangerment, and unexplored exploitation of women  works against this. The author would have us believe that the strippers  really have the upper hand, but why, in the epilogue, do so many of them  leave the joint for such heretofore unimagined pursuits such as law school?  OK, let's just take it tongue in cheek...but after a while it begins to  read like a male fantasy, with the author rescuing the women and punishing  the unjust. While exposing the corruption of Florida's sugar cane industry,  there's very little comment about the lurid, potentially dangerous life of  a stripper. (Oh, those must be the &quot;BAD&quot; strippers, not the ones  described here.)  3 ½ * if you've never read the author before, he's funny,  ironic, and writes an exciting conclusion, but I respectfully disagree with  my Amazon colleagues who rate this a 5.

The pictures are  very detailed and a bit abstract, but not unrecognizable or too cluttered  for our 4 year old.<br />A very unique and funny book, it's great for children  between about four and nine.

King in this powerful retelling of the classic American legend.  This is another treasure from Rabbit Ear  productions: a beautifully illustrated book that can be read on its own, or  with the included cassette.  Go for the cassette first: You'll be treated  to Denzel Washington's warm, rich, folksy, awe-struck, conversational  narration.<br />&quot;So y'all listen up, `cause I'm gonna tell you the  guaranteed, gold plated, ninety-nine-point-nice percent truth about John  Henry.&quot;<br />Then, enjoy the inimitable riffs of B.B. King, as he and  his guitar (presumably &quot;Lucille&quot;) sing out with the pure, clear,  authenticity of the blues: &quot;My name is John Henry. I'm a born natural  man. I was born one morning with a hammer in my hand . . . &quot;  This is  collector material.<br />John Henry's triumph defends the dignity and  perseverance of human labor against the encroaching machine.  In its own  small way, with a low-tech  assist from the aural majesty of Washington and  King, this volume preserves and extends the pleasures of the written page.	2000-06-20

Cyrano, in this scenario, is a sheriff with a somewhat large nose, and an even bigger crush  on the belle of the town, Roxane, the sheepish (literally) librarian.  Trouble is, Cyrano's deputy, Wolfie (yes, he's a wolf) has a thing for  Roxane as well.<br />But that's not Cyrano's only problem: The Gila Monster  Gang (umm, they're Gila Monsters) comes in a-shooting up and robbing the  town. The story proceeds loosely along the lines of the original (with some  action and sarsaparillas thrown in for Western authenticity) as the amorous  but shy Cyrano writes poems for Roxane, signed by Wolfie. But, when the  Gila Monster Gang threatens to rob the train at Purple Rock River, Cyrano  (with the agility and power of a Kobe to Shaquille dunk) uses all his  talents to capture the gang and win Roxane's heart.<br />I think Roxane puts  it best: &quot;Cyrano! Your great nose has taught you to be courageous, but  your poetry has lassoed my heart!&quot;  Highly recommended!	2000-06-20

Thayer's classic ballad, `Casey at the Bat,' is greatly enhanced by Patricia Polacco's brilliantly achieved, big-hearted illustrations. Ms. Polacco captures emotion, action, and character through wittily  exaggerated, slightly loopy pictures, and through lots of uncrowded  background shenanigans.  It's very cinematic: She effectively isolates  action through extreme close-ups, and extends time through a montage of  events occurring within a single picture.  Like the auteur she is, she even  adds some opening and closing story elements (while leaving the poem  intact) that  augment the poem's appeal to the younger reader.<br />This book  is simply great fun to read aloud; you'll find yourself wanting to memorize  its evocative imagery and epic aspirations:<br />&quot;Ten thousand eyes were  on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt; Five thousand tongue applauded  when he wiped them on his shirt. Then while the writhing pitcher ground the  ball into his hip, Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's  lip.&quot;<br />You and your youngsters will love the humor and the drama in  this a classic rendition of Thayer's beloved poem.  Infants and toddlers  will enjoy the bright pictures, and all readers will appreciate the perfect  teaming of Thayer and Polacco.	2000-06-19

This 1953 story begins with Ms. Wise's typically lyrical prose: &quot;Born at sea in the teeth of a gale, the sailor was a dog.  Scuppers was his name.&quot;  However, much of the book's language is not quite as  enchanting, nor as warmly and wisely love-soaked as Ms. Brown's  &quot;Runaway Bunny.&quot; Perhaps it's just that this is aimed at a  slightly older reader/listener than 'Bunny.'<br />The revelation here (in this  Golden Book edition) is the very richly-hued palette of Garth Williams,  who, for example, uses orange, purple, and varied shades of green with  originality and flair.  Some of his pictures recall (and may have  inspired?)  Richard Scarrey's busily occupied town creatures.  The two-page  illustration of Scuppers asleep in his cabin may very well lull your little  one to sleep, and invite adult fantasies of building a cozy houseboat.  Recommended!	2000-06-19

They furnish insights  into and first-person accounts of bop's development, along with a  collection of anecdotes variously hilarious and poignant.  The oral history  reads easily, partly because Gitler wisely leaves enough room for each  musician to speak, and because he links the narratives together with brief  but helpful comments.<br />An excellent book for either the student of jazz  or the casual reader; \\"Swing to Bop\\" is a revealing account of the  musicians' culture and the improvisations on a form that coalesced into  bop.  With 12 pages of photographs and a useful index.	2000-06-14

Great Illustrations, Playful Dialogue  4 1/2*	This is the story of some tools (e.g., Penny Plane, Mike Hammer, and Walter Wrench) stuck in the basement, yearning to taste the comforts of  the upstairs life.  Meanwhile, the upstairs appliances, including Blake  Blender, Suzie Seltzer Bottle, and Calvin Coffeepot (the latter looking  suspiciously like Thelonious Monk) contemplate cleaning the neglected,  sink-clogged, slimy kitchen.  But before they do, the downstairs tools  stage a coup d'etat (or de kitchen, as it were).  The victorious tools  devise ways to make lunch and clean up, while the appliances tackle the  filthy basement, with the not-so-startling conclusion that it takes  different tools working together to clean a house.<br />The fun is primarily  the loopy picture style that recalls Disneyland's Toon Town, and the  groanfully corny puns of the tools: &quot;`Hey Walter Wrench,' said Penny  Plane, `remember the time you fixed that drippy faucet?' `Yep, I really had  a grip back then . . . '&quot;  and &quot;`Heck, I bet we could run the  kitchen!'&quot; hammered Mike.  Our little boy loved this book, and it's  great fun to read out loud.  Worth looking for!	2000-06-14

At its best the book covers the intellectual and moral distance from Twain's boyhood in Hannibal (where slavery was accepted as &quot;natural&quot;) to his Elmira, Connecticut  evolution, where, as a kind of Southern expatriate (and son-in-law of a  fervent abolitionist living in an important Underground railway stop), he  challenged himself and the nation to fight racial inequality.  At its  worst, the book is a somewhat self-important narrative of the author's  journey from researcher to advocate. In toto, it is well worth  reading.<br />Dr. Fishkin, editor of Oxford's complete works of Mark Twain,  wrote the earlier &quot;Was Huck Black?  Mark Twain and African-American  voices&quot; in which she argues that the &quot;voice&quot; of Huck Finn is  drawn directly from the &quot;rich creative oral tradition&quot; of slaves  and ex-slaves whom Twain met. Here she revisits Hannibal, the town that  practiced &quot;mild domestic slavery,&quot; though Twain's own father sold  a slave &quot;down the river&quot; (and away from his family) for $40 worth  of tar. Perhaps not coincidentally this is how much the eventually  tar-feathered king and duke received for selling Jim. Racism is still  evident in Hannibal, where the &quot;erasure&quot; of any black history  mirrors the nationwide removal of &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; from school  libraries.  Fishkin argues convincingly that Twain's use of humor and irony  serves, from Elmira onward, to expose, ridicule, and directly confront the  enduring injustices of the Reconstruction years.  Indeed, the controversial  ending of `Finn,' in which an already-freed Jim is locked up and subjected  to terrors by Tom and Huck, is interpreted by Fishkin and others as an  accurate comment on the mirage of freedom offered to ex-slaves during  Reconstruction.<br />This covers the first 126 pages of the book, and aside  from some rather self-important comment on a five-year-old's hitting her  with a miniature bullwhip, &quot;I had just been bullwhipped on the banks  of the Mississippi,&quot; it is a sobering and fascinating account of the  racial whitewashing of Hannibal and America.<br />The next 77 pages contain  some redundant, wide-eyed commentary on the omnipresence of Twain in  American culture, both low and high (Chapter 3), and, in the epilogue,  unnecessary innocent-by-association defenses of Twain.  Both sections could  have been pruned and achieved the same effect.  Chapter 3 is amusing; it  seems that Twain's image has been appropriated by entrepreneurs,  playwrights and others to sell everything from imported ale to dry-cleaning  to TV scripts. Many of Twain's famous quotes (e.g., &quot;Everybody talks  about the weather, but nobody does anything about it,&quot; and &quot;The  coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco&quot;) are either  undocumented or came from someone else. But these examples, while  suggesting that Twain functions the &quot;consummate Rorschach test&quot;  of one's beliefs about America, are piled atop each other to include  digressions such as which is the best movie adaptation of Twain's work;  a  long catalogue of books and other media that are either about Twain,  &quot;borrow&quot; from his works (including her 11-year-old's &quot;A  Return to Camelot&quot;), or that feature a fictionalized Twain;  a  comparison of both Fishkin's laptop computer and an IBM voice recognition  machine to Twain's interest in an automatic typesetting machine.  (The IBM  machine, Fishkin dutifully reports, interpreted Twain's &quot;rotten  glad&quot; as &quot;writing glad,&quot; and &quot;anybody but lied&quot; as  &quot;any body butterfly.&quot;)<br />The &quot;epilogue&quot; also takes too  long; Dr. Fishkin vigorously but somewhat condescendingly defends  &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; from Jane Smiley's 1992 critique in  &quot;Harper's.&quot;  Fishkin questions whether Smiley's could comprehend  writer Ralph Wiley's deep valuation of Twain: &quot;How could understanding  Mark Twain's works be essential to any child in twenty-first century  America....Smiley would shake her head.  Not a clue.&quot; Dr. Fishkin also  parades an all-star gallery of authors who defend Twain, and comment on his  influence on their writing.  She quotes a &quot;silver-haired Oxford  don&quot; who sputtered, &quot;This is going to sound very negative, but I  can't figure out what you Americans see in this book,&quot; and later  speculates, somewhat smugly, that the &quot;don would have agreed, most  likely&quot; with an 1870 British publication describing Twain as a  &quot;very offensive specimen of the vulgarest kind of Yankee.&quot;<br />This  is still an excellent book, despite its need for some editorial restraint,  and its meandering trip through Twain's influence on culture.  Because the  book has so much to offer its few faults are all the more annoying.  Perhaps Dr. Fishkin is preaching to the unconverted: Those who think  Twain's masterpiece is a racist tract that should be abolished from schools  and libraries.

This epidemic attacks inhibitions: Friends, co-workers, even  strangers drop spontaneously hug, celebrate, leave their jobs to pursue  long-abandoned fantasies, and have guilt-free and always-safe sex.  It's  like &quot;The Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; in reverse--instead of  producing automatons, the intruder recovers your humanity, releases the  repressed id, and generally induces a madcap euphoria.<br />So, what's the  problem? If you're protagonist Jim Rowan (a minor planning commissioner  soon to become Mayor after the latter runs off  to a model train  convention), the problems are potentially enormous--maybe the trains don't  have to run on time, but they do have to run. As do the hospitals, police  department, fire stations, transportations systems, and other essential  human services.  It also doesn't help when your spouse catches the virus  and runs amok in the city.<br />Part of the genius here is McHugh's mixing of  the silly and the sexy with the practical and scientific.  There are  intelligent discussions of psychiatry, epidemiology, city planning, and  philosophy placed with discretion amidst the delirium.  And, although it  inhabits  a particular American past, the book's slightly cautionary  hedonism has an admirable egalitarian stance: Men and women share in the  equal employment of desire.<br />This would have made a great movie, with the  potential to rival the most intelligent of the screwball comedies. So as  you read it, I suggest you imagine your own &quot;movie,&quot; casting  Jimmy Stewart or Fonda or Grant; Lauren Bacall or Eve Arden, Rosalind  Russell or Jean Harlow.  Set it in the New York of the Ritz, the Colony,  and Sardi's, fill it with the sassy repartee of Bogart and Bacall--or Nick  and Nora Charles-- and please, film it in sharp, shimmering black and  white: Because they don't make books--or movies--like this anymore!Harlow.

It's a highly unique poetry narrative,  filled with magical excursions and inventive characters, rather like the  Beatles meet Lewis Carroll.<br />The fanciful illustrations, featuring Russian  Orthodox and Victorian architecture and recalling Da Vinci, Chagall (watch  for the flying cow), and medieval manuscripts, are detailed and  self-referential (without being overwhelming).<br />The imaginative drawings  perfectly suit the richly imaged poetic content:<br /> &quot;The man in  the marmalade hat  bustled through all the rooms,  and calling for  dusters and brooms,  he trundled the guests from their beds,  badgers and hedgehogs and moles.  Winter is over, my loves, he said.  Come away from your hollows and holes.&quot;<br />There are strains of Emily  Dickenson as well,&quot;'Belief` shall be a boat having both feet and  fins.&quot;  But perhaps this sounds too literary and serious. This is,  above all, a fun and creative book for all ages: Children and adults will  find inspiration to free their own poetic and pictorial musings.  There is  much to explore here.  A book you'll turn to and treasure for years to  come!	2000-05-28

Another winner in Rosemary Wells' slyly  hilarious &quot;Max&quot; series, this time Max and his older sister Ruby have just $5 to replace his &quot;disgusting&quot; pants.  Max has his eyes set on a &quot;dragon  shirt,&quot; but Ruby has to get those pants.<br />Their ensuing  misadventures in a department store take the bunny pair from &quot;Large  Appliances&quot; to &quot;Boy's Sportswear&quot; (a caution: Max is  momentarily lost in the store, this may or may not be frightening to your  little one).  With big colorful illustrations by Wells and a happy ending  (well, for Max!), this is a fun story of siblings on the loose.  22 pages,  with watercolor/pen and ink pictures on each page.	2000-05-27

(4 1/2 *)	Another winner from James Stevenson!<br />Set at the turn of the 19 th century, this story is a visual delight with a light-hearted message for kids and adults alike.  Little mouse Hubert and his rather straight-laced  parents vacation at a seaside resort (a beautifully pictured Victorian).  Hubert discovers that he's the only kid there, and that the other animal  guests are not very interested in him.<br />Then, Hubert has the good fortune  (and the curiosity) to meet Alf, the hotel groundskeeper. He shows Hubert  that &quot;there's plenty to do around here...but you have to keep your  eyes peeled.&quot; Together they enjoys some unexpected joys of nature, and  Hubert takes a thrilling ride in Alf's homemade glider.<br />My five-year-old  and I enjoyed this very much. The pictures of late 19th century houses and  trains are richly detailed, from the candelabras to the stenciled ceilings.<br />Stevenson effectively conveys how joy can be found in seemingly boring  places. It takes some curiosity,and sometimes some adult guidance to  discover that joy.  A fun book for kids and adults: Highly recommended!	2000-05-25

I've been doing data analysis for almost 20 years and recommend this highly.  It is not too advanced for the beginning college student or professional, but more weighty than the small Introduction to SAS books  (which seem more suitable for those with no experience). Because it  interweaves SAS programming with often used statistics (and offers  excellent examples and interpretations of output throughout), it is ideal  for a stats and/or SAS course.<br />I find it useful for reviewing SAS  steps, and as a quick stats overview. The big SAS books are fine as a  reference or for researching more complex and/or narrower questions, but  this is far more user-friendly.  Highly recommended for the beginning to  moderate statistician or programmer.	2000-05-23

Segall adeptly shows how Joyce's work,  offering a panoply of images, word-play, and interior monologue, functions  as a psychological projective test: Critics' reading of the book bends to  fit their political, cultural, and aesthetic preferences.  Although not  surprising, given the ambiguity and teasing allusions of  &quot;Ulysses,&quot; it is amusing to see Joyce's work admired and reviled  by the Left, and admired and reviled by the Right. T.S. Eliot saw Ulysses  as a work &quot;penetrated with Christian feeling&quot;; classicist Paul  Elmore More saw a &quot;congeries of ugly pictures expressed in the streets  of Dublin gutters.&quot;<br />Segall leads us through the reactions of various  literary &quot;schools,&quot; including Russian and American Marxists (one  chapter deals mostly with the Soviet response), the New Humanists,  liberals, Catholics, and a few of the post-structualists. To me, the most  balanced and insightful critics are Edmund Wilson (I now want to read his  &quot;Axel's Castle&quot;), and Joyce's preeminent biographer, Richard  Ellman.<br />While I enjoyed the book (except for a few annoying repetitions  of words and phrases), I think it is best suited to either those familiar  with Joyce's works or who have a strong interest in literary criticism.  That said, I also think the book offers much to people who haven't read  Ulysses, but either have read &quot;Portrait of ...&quot; or know something  about Joyce's style. Reading the book's introduction and conclusion first  will also help. Recommended!	2000-05-22

Written from the perspectives of the owners, trainers, jockeys, bettors, and the horses (!), Smiley describes the interplay between about 50 humans and 12 racing  horses.  While this may confuse at first, Smiley's vivid and distinctive  portraits help the reader distinguish between the large cast.  This dense  population ultimately helps because it richly depicts the sociocultural  context (much like Tom Wolfe).<br />&quot;Horse Heaven&quot; conveys the role  of luck in the success and failure of both human and horse.  It also  sensitizes readers to some of the cruel outcomes involved in racing without  being preachy.<br />You don't have to be a track  aficionado to enjoy the  technical descriptions of racing, although equestrians will enjoy Smiley's  eye for detail. Highly recommended: A great summer read!	2000-05-22

With its stunningly original illustrations and long-named hero, I expected a real find. Instead I discovered a tedious one-joke story featuring a sadistic teacher.  Oh, I know, it's all meant as fun, but there was nothing  amusing about a boy forced to repeat 400 times &quot;I must not tell lies  about lions and I must not tear my trousers,&quot; and who is threatened  with a beating.<br />The book is neither very funny nor wise.  There are so  many outstanding children's books; this is not one of them.	2000-05-20

Our five-year old loves the Henry and Mudge series, and this is a fine example of its appeal. When Henry gets sick, he and Mudge share popsicles and crackers (well, Mudge gets the crackers; he gets the popsicles). But  then, Mudge awakes and seems strangely subdued.<br />The family takes him to  the vet, where, in one of the funnier scenes, the anxious dog sheds all  over the waiting room. The happy ending, simple yet interesting structure,  and depiction of a boy and dog's mutual love make for an entertaining book  for young children.  Repetition of some words and satisfying pictures tied  to the story will help the new reader.	2000-05-16

Inspired by a Scientific American  volume, delving into ancient and contemporary history (they meet the  inventor of the &quot;Ozzy Osbourne Liver Launcher,&quot; a catapult  designed to fling cow organs into the audience, but which, in its beta  version, splattered  security personnel on stage) they recount the  difficulties of recreating a centuries-old weapon without DOD funding  (although they succeed in winning a $500 grant from a local Arts Center  &quot;to observe the impulse to shoot a catapult&quot;).<br />The authors  describe the catapult's history, with notes on the development, historical  use, and mechanics of other weapons.  All of this is interesting, but is  not the heart of the book:  How two contemporary adults--with the vague and  unencumbered fascination of the naive--transcend limited mechanical and  material resources and build something transcendent and personal, both art  and science.  Self-indulgent? Perhaps. But clear, plain writing and a nice  eye for detail make this entertaining and unusual story work.	2000-05-15

This is, above all, a funny and playful book, playful with itself and the various conceits of fiction: the suspension of disbelief, the conventions of  form, and the pretensions of rhetoric.  Think of it as Pirandello meets  the Marx Brothers.<br />&quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; delights in rapid-fire  wordplay and sophomoric experimentation (there are three alternative  beginnings to the story).  O'Brien succeeds in this bombastic flair partly  because he doesn't take the literary enterprise--his own included--too  seriously.  He  races along at a Groucho-like pace, only to slow down in  wonderfully overwritten and overwrought scenes:<br />&quot;Together the two  strong men, joyous in the miracle of their health, put their bulging thews  and the fine ripple of their sinews together at the arm-pits of the  stricken king as they bent over him with their grunting red faces, their  four heels sinking down in the turf of the jungle with the stress of their  fine effort as they hoisted the madman to the tremulous support of his  withered legs.&quot;<br />Indeed!<br />James Joyce praised O'Brien as  &quot;a real author, with the true comic spirit,&quot; and Graham Greene  called this &quot;a book in a thousand....in the line of Tristram Shandy  and Ulysses.&quot;  Like Joyce, O'Brien dazzles us with language and the  sheer sound of words. The narrative is interrupted with rhetorical notes  (&quot;Name of figure of speech: Litotes [or Meiosis]&quot;), populated by  varying narrators &quot;Tour de force by Brinsley, vocally interjected,  being a comparable description in the Finn canon:,&quot; and buoyed by  dialogue that variously recalls 30's screwball comedies,B-movie Westerns,  and bad courtroom dramas.<br />O'Brien himself offers some literary  &quot;theory&quot; that illustrates his comic sensibility and offers sly  clues for his delighted (and maybe perplexed) reader:  &quot;...a  satisfactory novel should be a self-evident sham to which the reader could  regulate at will the degree of his credulity,&quot; and, &quot;Most authors  spend their time saying what has been said before--usually said much better  (Page 33).&quot; Flann O'Brien's command of--and upending of--narrative  forms, and the hilarity of his farce make this an essential addition to any  comic library.

Here the twain is met, with both comic and tragic results.<br />Satirizing the eclectic &quot;industry&quot; of religions and  cults in the impoverished town of Malomba, the author effectively parodies  the spiritual/physical healing quest of Mrs. Hemony, towing along her  daughter, Zoe, and son, James.  Zoe, in particular, is an appealing  character (raised chiefly in an Italian commune, she is told by a  representative of their entrepreneurial guru, &quot;you'd be a sensation in  California!&quot;) who drifts from her mother's well-intentioned control to  the more secular/sexual appeals of Malomba.<br />The book takes a few too  many cheap shots at the Westerners, and Laki, the hotel's poorly-paid  concierge, is written somewhat too broadly. Laki is eventually punished  after his successful courting of the Hemodys, and this denouement seems  contrived, as if to make up for the oh-so-loveable portrait previously  drawn. However, enjoy it for the farce, and the sensual descriptions of the  author's holy-city fantasy!	2000-05-10

While photographs are  the inspiration, Dyer's writing is so precise and sensual that he need only  describe the photographs (the book has only one small photo).  And this is  just right for a book about music, his writing is so lyrical that we almost  hear the sounds while reading.  (In fact. the least effective aspect of the  book is the Duke Ellington &quot;road trip&quot; that introduces each  chapter, perhaps because the narrative is not connected to any particular  Ellington sound.)<br />Many of the scenes and dialogue (especially the inner  dialogue) are necessarily fictions, &quot;assume that what's here has been  invented or altered rather than quoted.&quot;  But Dyer's explains that  while his version may veer from the truth,  &quot;it keeps faith with the  improvisational prerogatives of the form.&quot;  He mixes truth and  fiction into portraits that illuminate what strictly factual history cannot  always convey.  (Think of Robert Graves' in his WWI memoir/fiction  &quot;Goodbye to All That.&quot;).  Dyer explains that while a photo  depicts only a &quot;split second,&quot; its &quot;felt duration&quot; may  include the unseen moments before and after that split second.  &quot;But  Beautiful&quot; invites us to improvise (as Dyer does) into that unseen  time, and discover our own subjective relationship to the music.<br />Listen  to this: &quot;Chet put nothing of himself into his music and that's what  lent his playing its pathos...Every time he played a note he waved it  goodbye.  Sometimes he didn't even wave.&quot;<br />The evocative word  pictures are unusually perceptive and sensitive. Although personal and  often imagined,  it's really like an improvised solo that either feels  &quot;right&quot; or not.  I think  &quot;But Beautiful&quot; hits the  right notes and rhythms: his words evoke the music, and, after reading it,  the music will evoke the words.  Not without its flaws, it is still an  astonishing feat.goodbye.  Sometimes he didn't even wave.&quot;<br />The evocative word  pictures are unusually perceptive and sensitive.

Jim and Andy's bar, located at 48th Street and 6th Avenue in New York, was a home, restaurant, answering service, employment agency, bank, storage place, and general hang-out for some of the 60's most famous jazz  musicians, including Gerry Mulligan, Clark Terry, Coleman Hawkins, Ben  Webster, Eddie Davis, Al Cohn, and Zoot Sims--with visits from Belafonte,  Bennett, Horne, and Vaughan.<br />Here, the bar serves primarily as a backdrop  for Lees' intimate conversations with musicians and observations on the  idiom. Lee admonishes critics who question the status of jazz as a  &quot;serious&quot; art form.  The rest of the book, while somewhat  overly-structured, includes chapters devoted to such icons as Woody Herman,  Artie Shaw, Billy Taylor, and Art Farmer. The writing is uniformly lucid;  the anecdotes humorous and illuminating.<br />While the book doesn't return to  a satisfying coda to either Jim and Andy's (now closed) or the new  hang-outs, Lee's first person narrative conveys a singular warmth and  sympathy, radiant with his love of jazz.	2000-05-04

This is one of the most engaging titles I've seen in years.  I was looking forward to a clash of East v. West, of the legal v. the spiritual, all leavened by a large dash of humor.<br />Instead I found a entertaining, but  ultimately disappointing book.  The plot is sort of an Indian &quot;Maltese  Falcon,&quot; only this time, &quot;the stuff that dreams are made of&quot;  is a statuette of the Hindu god Shiva.  Our hero, a London barrister  (smart! good-looking!), is off to India (where he grew up) to dig up leads,  and, eventually, romance.<br />The description of the Western guests and  Eastern hosts--all suspects!-- and the atmospheric hotel from which the  statuette was purportedly stolen is wonderful escapism. The guests parody  varying attitudes towards the East (variously appalled, shocked,  intoxicated, patrician):  Enjoy these characters and their sense-satiating  hotel with a long cool summertime drink.<br />But the plot, and most of the  characters, proceed without sufficient development or surprise to match the  promise of the earlier narrative.  And when it all ends (in a Perry  Mason-like long confessional), one wishes that the book had taken a  different, perhaps more whimsical direction.<br />Being a  short novel, it is  probably worth your time to read it, if only for an introduction to Rumer  Godden, and as an antidote to summer's gasoline-soaked barbeques and  blaring baseball games.<br />(I look forward to reading other books by this  renowned author.)	2000-05-01
