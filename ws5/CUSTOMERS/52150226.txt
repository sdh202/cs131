Filled with intrigue and suspense that puts him at the top of my 'must read' list. His well researched novels, this time around, includes Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, some history of bio-chemical warfare, the divide between Muslims two major groups and much more. With all this, you get a great adventure to boot. Doesn't get much better than this for great entertainment.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.	2005-10-12

While reading parts of it I was visualizing the protagonist as a cinematic 007, as well as a Ludlum/Clancy type rogue spy. A good combination. This looks to be the first in a series featuring Cooper and Laramie. I didn't see the great depth to the characters as other reveiwers did, and would have liked to learn a little more about them. Still good entertainment.<br /><br />\\"Live slow, Mon.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-10-04

The way Tanenbaum entertwined 2 or 3 major plots is the sign of a skilled author, and I thought he did a fantastic job. International terrorism, rascism, courtroom drama, family drama, all of this and more, make for a compelling and enthralling story with a very high 'entertainment value'.

It \\"robs a soldier of free will without their knowledge, overides their sense of compassion and neutralizes the fear of injury\\".<br /><br />The well researched sciences (psychological, biological, cosmological, etc) involved in the writing of this novel made it both highly entertaining and educational.<br /><br />A fascinating thriller well worth your time.<br /><br />From inside: \\"The human mind is a strange amalgam of deep-seated, foundational Darwinian impulses and rational centers of higher control.

I very much enjoyed this novel and I think Larkin will soon be out on his own, without the need for Ludlums' namesake. Though, as common sense dictates, without the name Ludlum on the title, sales would not be near as high. I agree with one reviewer in regard to the heroes surviving as long as they do, when the killers talk instead of shoot. Oh well, its good escapist fiction either way.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2005-09-20

Though he brings in the common villian who is brainwashed by his religious beliefs, he puts a unique spin on it. What also caught my interest was the way Ablow integrated the secret society of the Skull and Bones, which is the oldest and most prestigious of Yales 7 secret societies, that was established in 1832. President Bush is rumored to be a member among other powerful figures.<br /><br />This was a highly entertaining and fascinating novel.

Antonelli is a memorable character that's very likeable and who seems to have a lot of common sense. (I liked his views on capital punishment).<br /><br />The story seemed a little rushed and could have used a little more detail in places.

The timing is also good since, just recently, a pope has been anointed. But if your looking for an action packed suspenseful thriller in the vein of Dan Brown, don't expect this one to deliver. It was well written but came off as a little dry to me.

It does move along at a gradual pace yet still draws you into the story and characters. You'll certainly learn quite a bit about Bologna, Italy and the surrounding area (almost too much?).<br /><br />I wonder if Grisham might write another Joel Blackman novel?

I have picked up some of his previous novels but never finished one. He definitely gets into detail when it comes to the military and its machinery. His solid story telling and the topical subject of terrorism make this a fairly entertaining novel that I see pleases most of his fans.<br /><br /> I'm sure his military knowledge is much better than his knowledge of air traffic control 'phraseology', which really made me laugh (being an ATC).

The ending and overall explanation meant to convey a religious overtone ruined it. Hopefully you're not going this route because it sells, if you are, you're going to lose some fans.<br />&quot;If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.&quot; -Albert Einstein	2004-06-08

The storyline and the pace move along at a speed that will keep you more than satisfied. Jake Grafton plays a pivotal role in the novel, yet he's more of a sideliner (An important one though). A satifying thriller that Coonts fans will enjoy.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-03

The mystery. The suspense.<br />This book is worth reading, though it's not his best. Most of the mysteries and questions were thrown at you in the last few pages (making it complex enough to make you loopy).<br />Recommended.	2004-05-29

I have not yet been disappointed.<br />This time he has written a well crafted techno-thriller. The 'techno' portion has been done before in the past (Hal), but the way it's put together with the characters and the dating matchups gives it originality.<br />Recommended.	2004-05-25

This novel is not only timely, it offers up a character (Mitch Rapp) who knows what it takes to win war on terrorism, like it or not.<br />An exciting story you'll want to read quickly. Looking forward to the next Rapp novel.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-05-19

Preferrably the Booklist review.<br />As a somewhat avid thriller reader, there was something about this novel that didn't take with me. There was action and some suspense but it seemed to lack the gripping pace and 'pull you in' writing that I come to expect.<br />This is my first David Lindsey novel. I'm not sure if there will be another.	2004-05-02

See storyline above.<br />In my opinion, congratulations are in order for Phillip Margolin for writing, what I think, is one of his best novels to date.

I liked the subject matter (Colliders, etc) and the small education about the Higgs boson (When you get on the scale in the morning, you may be hoping that it registers a smaller number than the day before -- you may be hoping that you've lost weight. It's the quantity of mass in you, plus the force of gravity, that determines your weight. But what determines your mass?).<br />The story moved at a steady pace and kept me entertained.	2004-04-22

This international thriller is fast-paced and satisfying.

Though there isn't much in the form of originality here, he does a good job of melding all these genres together and creates a story thats engrossing and captivating. The cruelty of kids, as well as parents, is well depicted.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-04-02

Each time I start one of these stories I just keep thinking Lindsay Boxer is a man, but that's just because male authors obviously know a mans perspective better than a womans, and as a reader it's what I expect (but he seems to do women well?!).<br />Anyway, once I'm into the story I forget most of that and just enjoy the fast-pace and the unexpected turns. A good story that's comparable to the other two in the series.	2004-03-31

Filled with death defying action and unbelievable escapes, Matthew Reilly again shows us what adrenaline pounding action is all about. This book almost makes Clive Cussler's writing seem like a pussycat--well, maybe not quite.<br />In an interview at the end of the novel Matthew admits it's &quot;...outrageous and over-the-top...accept that I sometimes have to bend the truth (and, hell, the laws of physics!) for the sake of a roller-coaster story.&quot;<br />This one's strictly for fun. It would also make one heck of a movie--of course the movie would require more computer effects than anything I've seen.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-03-26

This novel contains both explicit violence and sex.<br />The first person perspective of the villian gives great depth to that character and shows you just how crazy he is.<br /> A dark and entertaining read.	2004-03-17

This takes away some of the fun of reading, unpredictability. ( If you don't read the book flap you'll be in for more surprises). That being said, I still liked it.<br /> A sharply written medical thriller which also brings up some interesting ethical issues. Throughout the novel you'll be treated to some of the authors own medical stories. A good read.<br />Recommended.	2004-03-13

With its intricate plotting, this novel is best read in a day or two.<br /> Stephen Frey does a good job explaining big business and accounting, giving you an inkling of an idea how companies like Enron and Worldcom eroded.<br />A suspenseful and fast-moving novel I found very entertaining.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-03-07

It was a little bit of a struggle to get through, but when I reached the end, I decided it wasn't such a bad book. Stephen White fans will see this as an average effort from the author.	2004-02-28

The weaponry is researched, the action is good, and you know his protagonist is invulnerable. The invulnerability of Scot Harvath (like Cusslers' Pitt) will make you suspend belief in the story but it sure makes for great escapist reading. Keep it up Brad Thor, your books keep getting better.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-02-03

The action takes place not only on the sea (thank goodness) but also on land. Some of his characters do have a tendency to be super human (a youngster sailing halfway around the world and a guy who loses an eye, which hardly effects him).<br /> His knowledge of the sea comes through clearly in all his novels. Of course I have very little knowledge about sailing and the sea, so while I learn more from his books, much of it still goes over my head (ref: boat parts and shipping terms). Yet even with all the boating jargon it makes for a gripping thriller.<br /><br />Recommended.	2004-01-27

This one was very entertaining but it doesn't add much when it comes to originality. You get your typical dangers such as piranhas, anacondas and jaguars.

As one reviewer notes its more a literary thriller. Plenty of prose here. Once you develop compassion for the protagonist it gets a little better, but overall I still think its a little over-written, though at the same time well-written (this might only make sense to me). Not something I'd read over again.	2004-01-19

874538:US	52150226	R1PZQ4MIL60V38	0399150803	642490368	Trojan Odyssey (Dirk Pitt Adventure)	Books	5	0	5	N	N	Great Cussler	See storyline above.<br />Cussler again delivers a high level adventure that should please all his fans. This time he throws in a little history about Odysseus' great voyage as well as a lesson in Celtic Culture and the Druids.<br />I thought this was a well rounded adventure and a great escape. One of Cusslers best. It includes all the regular characters, as well as introducing Dirk Pitt's new found son and daughter, Dirk and Summer, who have an adventure of their own. You'll get no disappointment reading this newest adventure.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-06

Though I would have preferred an unabridged version, the abridged version is chuck full of the most important discoveries. Bill Bryson has done a wonderful job in making science easy to understand and easy to love.<br />Highly recommended	2003-11-29

If you've not read any of them you might get a little confused as to some of the background (but you'll catch up). Either way you'll enjoy this supernatural thriller.<br />Wilson's ability to pull you into a story is one of the things that makes him one of the best in this genre. His knack of displaying highly visual and sometimes graphic scenes is also a bonus.<br />I don't think I've read anything bad by this author. Keep it up.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-11-25

There is action as well as romance. Much of the time is focused on Jonas Lamb's (the protagonist) relationships--a man who has had six marriages. It moves at a satifying pace with a satisfying ending.<br />Recommended.	2003-11-21

Maybe he should have read this again before putting his name on it. This would have made a heck of a good story if it had a little more depth and characterization but it was presented with too many characters who were given too little time. His next solo effort will surely blow this one out of the water.	2003-11-10

There wasn't much said about it, yet it ranks right up there with one of the best I've read recently. It's based on the interesting premise of creating a genetic virus that attacks (with 100% fatalities) only certain ethnic groups. The leader of that group is a powerful neo-nationalist japanese industrialist.<br />As well as being very suspenseful and well written, Lewis Perdue has done a lot of research regarding Japan's atrocities during WW2, ranking very near the cruelty of the Nazis. The science is solid, too.<br />I recommend this to anyone who likes a good scientific/medical thriller with international locales.	2003-11-04

It always amazes me how so many people believe everything they here on talk radio and TV (this is true on both sides of the political spectrum). That someone like Franken can break it down and analyze it and find the lies makes great reading.<br />Franken narrates in his usual and hilarious manner.<br /> I highly recommend the unabridged cd.	2003-11-01

This one is a little different as it takes place mostly in Cuba. The action is here, as is Earl Swagger and his penchant for getting in trouble, and when the odds are mostly against him he still seems to come out on top. Quite a hero.<br /> This is not my favorite Hunter novel but it was still exciting to read.<br />Recommended.	2003-10-30

What he's served up here is not your highly suspenseful thriller or a fast-paced shoot'em up. Instead what you get is a slowly unraveling mystery (and I mean slow), the type of which many authors write. Some people may love this kind of novel, but I don't.<br />It's not what I expected, but as far as straight mystery goes, it works.	2003-10-28

To see him come out with something different took me a little by surprise. I'm not disappointed, though. Smoke Screen is a tale of big business and the tobacco industry. There are arguments for both the anti-tobacco lobby and the Tobacco companys. The solution seems to me to be ideal, but not likely to come to fruition. So whether you're a smoker or not, you'll get plenty of ammo from this novel.<br />The protagonist, Trevor Barnett, did not strike me as a very likeable character. He seemed naive and wishy washy (not knowing which way to go on an issue).<br />This novel will have some naysayers, only because their used to the typical Mill's thrillers, but I enjoyed this foray into a different genre (probably because I used to smoke) and will continue looking for Kyle Mills on the book shelf.<br />Recommended.	2003-10-25

An exciting thriller that will take you to the past. With scenes about the 'tunnel rats' of Vietnam to the atrocities put forth by the Milosevics, including a wife, son and daughter described as making &quot;...the Munsters look like Little House on the Prairie&quot;, too the present, with hero/protagonist Calvin Dexter out to capture Zoran Zilic (the name even sounds evil) an old Milosevic henchman.<br /> I'd really like to see this become a series. With a great skill at writing international thrillers and a super hero like Calvin Dexter, how can you go wrong.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-10-22

This one is comparable to McMahons previous novels.<br />Recommended	2003-10-13

This is indeed what you get.<br />I did kind of miss Imelda Pepperfield (she had a very small cameo).<br />Highly recommended.	2003-10-09

I've gained a whole new respect for you Greg Iles. The entertainment you packed into this Scifi/thriller is wonderful. I haven't read a book this fast since Dan Brown's 'The DaVinci Code'. Seems you've stirred the pot a little bit here too, judging by some of the negative reviews. One of the things I like about fiction is the exploration of new and fresh ideas. This delivers.<br />&quot;God is merely a part of the human brain, an evolutionary coping mechanism that developed to make bearable our awareness of our own deaths.&quot; A quote by one of the numerous scientific characters in the book.	2003-10-03

It also makes a good thriller.<br />Don't expect a Dan Brown novel just because he wrote a positive blurb.<br />Though not as riveting as some, this novel kept me entertained.<br />I will read his next novel knowing it will be as good or better than the first.<br />Recommended.	2003-09-28

The last book I read like this was Tom Wolfe's A Man in Full.<br />It entertains at the same time it educates. You'll get a taste of the corporate life as well as the prison life. A well rounded novel written in a wonderfully entertaining and informative manner.<br />Recommended.	2003-09-23

I liked the pace and the intensity. Pottinger has put together an intense thriller that will grab you by the gut and won't let loose until you get to the very satisfying end.<br />The idea of biological/genetic terrorism comes to light, especially when it's written by Stan Pottinger.<br />Nicely done.<br />&quot;There are rules for everyone else, and then there are rules for monsters&quot;<br /> Highly recommended.	2003-09-13

This one was read by Lorelei King and she did an outstanding job with the narration and the voices (Lula just makes you laugh out loud). Easy to follow and perfect for the drive too and from work.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-09-06

An outstanding attorney that somehow gets by, even though he doesn't ever seem to make money.<br />Kincaid and his sidekicks--you gotta like Loving and his crazy conspiracy theories--whoop it up again in a very enjoyable legal/suspense thriller. I think this is one of Bernhardt's best. A gripping storyline written in a style that will draw you in.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-09-04

Hurwitz's lead character Tim Rackley has lost his young daughter to a brutal murder. What Hurwitz has done well is portray the pain that Rackley feels. The emotional dilemmas involved with the loss of a child hits close to home to anyone with a child. Along with the strong emotions there are ethical problems that are portrayed in the story concerning vigilanteism. Right or wrong? With the novel also comes plenty of action. Put all together, you get a great story that will keep you entertained. It might make you mad or it might make you happy, either way it will make you think.<br />The only negative I have is with the character of Rackley. I did not care to much for him. Maybe because of his views or because of his hypocrisy.<br />Recommended	2003-08-20

The premise was a little unbelievable but the entertainment quotient was high. I thought the characters were more than one dimensional and seemed to think there was depth to quite a few of them.<br /> The story itself was sometimes repetitive (meaning certain descriptions were repeated many times). This is good entertainment. I look forward to the next Zeman novel knowing it will be as good or better.<br />Recommended.	2003-08-08

He never has disappointed me yet.<br />His latest starts with a bang and doesn't let up till the end. It has witty dialogue (especially between Theo and Jack) along with a writing style that will keep you turning the pages.<br />I recommend this to everyone who likes a good mystery/thriller.	2003-08-06

I am so glad I did. In 'Ice Hunt' he takes adventure to a new level. The book's intense, the main subject very interesting (cryopreservation), and it reads like a combination of 007, Indiana Jones, and Dirk Pitt. A well rounded--and researched--adventure sure to please anyone with a taste for quality adventure.<br />I have to agree with the Amazon reviewer, though. The cover art gives it a somewhat hokey look (mass market?).<br />Most highly recommended.	2003-08-01

Well this time around he might just have a legitimate case.<br />The story moves at a rapid pace and concerns an interesting subject, top secret government experiments with DNA. You'll even get treated with a cameo by Shane Scully.<br />Cannell writes with a flare. You'll be finished reading this before you know it, feeling quite satisfied. Like a good movie.<br />Higly recommended.	2003-07-27

Okay, the plot had potential and the action was there, but this book seemed like it was very rushed. The characters didn't seem there usual self (Dillon being stopped by a tractor in the road? No other explanation?). Please. The brevity of the book and the rushed style (very little depth) made for a very disappointing read.<br />Not recommended.	2003-07-23

That's what you get. I too was surprised when I received this in a hardback instead of the paper. What I thought (since it was a hardback) was that Kurt Austin was going to replace Dirk Pitt as Cusslers main protagonist. I also got the impression that I would be reading a better novel (such as the Dirk Pitt hardbacks). Well it is good entertainment, and without a doubt, action packed, but its become a bit formulaic.<br />I will still always jump on the newest Cussler novel and certainly look forward to the newest Dirk Pitt.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-07-20

These are two names I love seeing on a book cover. What they deliver is pure entertainment. Fast-paced action with an original theme.<br />The protagonist, Pendergast, is also a mystery in himself, but still one of my favorite characters.<br />The action, along with a surprise ending, makes this an exciting and thrilling story.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-07-18

I agree the main character (Jack Reacher) is not very personable, but he is likeable and he always gets the bad guy. This you know from previous novels and this is also what makes it good escapist fiction. It gives you a good feeling when the bad guys go down.<br />Fast-paced and a lot of action. A novel you'll finish quickly.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-26

His novels always keep me on edge and it seems he gets better and better with each novel. This time around he seems to have made his protagonist, Thorn, a little more human, and not quite the superhero he was in previous novels. A fast paced and very gripping story. Keep up the good work.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-19

I kept expecting something more.<br /> It honestly sounded like a romance novel with just a little action. I read the first book of this series many, many books ago and didn't remember much of it...and this book certainly didn't refresh my memory much. If you like romance novels you'll somewhat enjoy this one (even though it's a ridiculous premise--Bird kids?. Yes I know it was all explained in the first novel, but still.)<br />Hopefully Patterson will team up with a better author, such as  he did with the novel &quot;Jester&quot;, and I can start enjoying a Patterson book again.	2003-06-15

Though some of the story is plausible (the genetics) and some not so much (memory implants), it works together fairly well. A fast-paced twisting ride sure to entertain.	2003-06-10

If I didn't have a back log of newer books on the shelf waiting to be read I would have suffered through the whole thing. Then again, if I had read the whole thing, maybe it would have been worth it. For what I expect and want from Koontz, it was not. Koontz, without a doubt, has a way with words, and with these he seems to be trying a new serious form that I just didn't care for. Oh well, maybe next time.	2003-06-09

The whole concept of the story was good but the 'putting together' was not.	2003-06-07

The characters lack depth and the story moves very rapidly. Because of the characters shallowness I found myself not really caring about them.

There are thrillers out there that are harder to put down than this one. Though Coben has written a great mystery, I think his previous novels are just as well written and told. To me the beginning seemed a little drawn out.<br /> The characters are great, the story will keep you guessing, and the plot is well rounded.

It's a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated, and manual labor is gradually being transferred to &quot;sims, &quot; genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human.&quot;<br />If you can overlook the fact that Congress--in this novel--determined that the use of these genetically made simian creatures (almost human and can speak english) are not animal or human, but rather property, then you'll enjoy this novel immensely. As I read further into the novel it somewhat explained the reason behind Congress' decision.<br /> The writing is superb, as one can expect from Wilson. The gripping story line and the rapid pace will leave you satisfied to the very end.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-05-01

See book summary above.<br />\\"During the Middle Ages in Europe ignorant, illiterate people were manipulated by appeals to the strains of intolerance and fanaticism that are part and parced of every religion. The Crusades, the popes' wars on heresy, the Spanish Inquisition, the war between Catholicism and Protestantism...all these horrors were committed in God's name. The result was the rise of the secular states, which grew into nations.<br />The Muslim world didn't move on--it's still trapped in the Middle Ages. Islam teaches that man should live a life that earns him God's mercy--it's no better or worse than any other religion.  Yet the Islamic fanatics are exporting the horrors to a developed world that moved on centuries ago. Perhaps this war between religion and secular society is a stage that every civilization has to go through. Maybe it's the only way for a people to gradually learn tolerance, which is the foundation for complex societies that can entertain new possibilities, new visions.\\"<br />This is a Jake Grafton speech (the protagonist of this and previous novels) and like it or not the book is filled with many of these little gems. This is about the only positive thing I can say about this Grafton novel. Yes I was disappointed. When I see Stephen Coonts on a book cover, no less a Jake Grafton novel, I expect alot. This didn't deliver. If you didn't read it in two or three sittings it's sometimes hard to remember who certain characters are, of which there are many. Maybe I'm just getting old but this one seemed to be a chore to read.	2003-02-12

Having assembled an international league of Islamic terrorist networks in an ingenious plot to topple both Israel and America, Harvath and his CIA-led team must reach Nidal before it's too late. One problem remains - they have no idea what the man looks like...\\"<br />I give this a five star rating because it was outstanding escapist fiction. The pace is relentless. You'll visit Bern, Chicago, Cairo, Jerusalem, The island of Capri, and Rome, along with a couple other spots. And yes its main focus is the dispute between the Israeli's and the Palestinians.

With this first solo attempt he hits a home run. What Lincoln Child has created in this novel is an elaborate theme park (in fact some of the descriptions of the park are so overwhelming they are hard to picture, so the author was thoughtful enough to put an illustration at the start) based on past cultures as well as future cultures.<br />This is a very entertaining and exciting novel. For some reason while I was reading this story, the movie 'Die Hard' kept coming to mind. Hmmm.<br />Highly recommended...strictly pleasure.	2003-01-12

This is more than police business, it's personal: Alexandra's closest friend is engaged to the producer. When he looks closer, Scully discovers that the man's mysterious past may hide deadly secrets.<br />To uncover them, he must work alongside a former down-and-outer-turned-Hollywood impresario to infiltrate the movie business' violent dark side, a world where deals are settled with handshakes but broken with the spilling of blood, and where the danger to Shane's loved one is all too real.\\"<br />After 35 years in Hollywood, Stephen J. Cannell knows what he's writing about. With this gripping crime drama he again gives you a glimpse on the inside 'goings on' of Hollywood.<br />The fact is this tale involves everyone from the Crips and Bloods to the Italian as well as Mexican Mafias.

This time around he has come out of his rut (not a big rut, of course) and served up some fantastic reading. The subject is the ever popular nanotechnology, though with Koontz you get the nanotech with a big dose of the supernatural. Koontz writes this novel with a certain flare. The prose, as well as the dialogue, is top-notch. Jilly (&quot;I should warn you I know Karaoke&quot;), Dylan, and his autistic brother Shep, make for an original and very likeable group of protagonists.<br />Dean Koontz has written one of his best novels and I highly recommend this to all his fans and to those looking for a fast paced thriller.	2003-01-03

They have good depth and characters but the story is not as thrilling and involving as his older works. As everyone else seems to think, his earlier novels are much better.

I myself will compare it to a made for TV movie, although it would do best on the Lifetime channel.<br />It was a pleasant departure from his normal thrillers, and because it was somewhat short, I decided to give it a try. I liked it. Baldacci can draw you into a story to where you actually care about the characters. Almost all the characters in this pleasant novel had something you liked about them.<br />I don't read stories like this very often and prefer to stick with thrillers, but it's nice to take a break every once in a while and read something 'feel good'.

It moved at a fast pace, but the main topic of brainwashed assassins going after Kirk McGarvey, the soon to be director of the CIA, just didn't seem to take my interest. Convoluted comes to mind.

Everything else was average. The main character, Henry Pierce, was not likeable. Maybe it was because he seemed very naive. His quest to find a missing prostitute made no sense. Why would anybody do what he did (risk his company and his life) to find someone whose phone number he was accidentally issued (or so it seems). Even his past history with his sister didn't seem reason enough. When you can't sympathize with the main character it's hard to really enjoy the story.	2002-11-09

As far as international thrillers go this is by far the best one that carries the Ludlum name. It is truly non-stop action, and along with that you get highly intelligent dialogue and story telling. It seems to be just a step above the normal Ludlum novel.<br />Keith Kahla was the senior editor that supposedly put this novel together. The publisher says about three quarters of the book was finished when Ludlum passed away.<br />A truly wonderful work of suspense. I wonder if there's a chance we might see Janson and Kincaid again. That I would surely like to see.<br />HIGHLY Recommended.	2002-11-06

He is a former FBI agent and is presently working as security chief for one of the worlds largest construction projects. The building, known as 'The Gold Swan' because its shape is similar to a swans neck, is the worlds tallest building coming in at 2500 feet. When Williams realizes the building is starting to lean, he discovers a conspiracy within the government to keep it quiet.<br />Thayer's solid writing along with his 'grab you by the seat' story telling made this a fun thriller to read. From the power struggles in the Chinese government to the powerful triads running the cities to the descriptions of Hong Kong(which made you feel as if you were there), I felt like this was a well rounded thriller and one of Thayer's best.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-10-29

There are a couple old folks who escaped a retirement home, a band called 'Johnny and the Contusions' whose main goal is to be high, drug runners, cocktail waitress's and a few others. All play a major role in this laugh out loud story.<br />The reader, Dick Hill, is a very talented voice actor.

There are many parts you can just glance over. There are only so many things you can describe about a cave chase scene. Predictable falls, trips, slides, and cave ins. The saving grace, obviously, was the mad scientist and his search for the moon rock.<br />The premise of using this mostly unexplored cave for the practice of moon miners seemed somewhat silly. Would not regular mines suffice? They're dark.	2002-09-04

I guessed the killer early in the novel and am a little surprised that Daphne and John overlooked him/her. It became almost frustrating to me as I kept reading and they remained clueless.<br />It's a story of a stalker that will take you into Seattle's underground. A place I didn't know existed.

It was a rather eye-opening account of the world of cooking (Bourdain's world anyway). It was well written and held my attention. I would recommend young chefs in training pick up a copy. Though Bourdain's way to success is not the common way, it sure has been quite a ride so far. Since reading this, my view point of the cooking field has changed somewhat.

Billy seems to stumble around quite a bit in most of the book, missing alot of clues (e.g. the rabid dog) and shaking in his boots every time he sees or hears a gun. This of course gives him the human quality achieved in this novel. Wiltse's descriptions of the area are accurate and almost make you feel as if you're there, describing the heat and humidity, &quot;Like sitting in an oven, wrapped in a wet horse blanket&quot;. A good story that is sometimes too wordy, but moves at a steady moderate pace.	2002-08-04

An original character on his own but still as tough as they come. This time around Austin and his regular partners-including Joe Zavala-- must stop a Russian mad man, who claims to be a Romanov descendent, from destroying the United States and becoming the new Tsar of Russia.<br />I am never disappointed with a Clive Cussler novel. The entertainment value is unbeatable. The subjects he writes about are well researched, as are the locales (Black Sea, Istanbul). Even though the good guys always miraculously win, it's still darn good storytelling.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-06-10
1519134:US	52150226	R2CGV7H3NH6EK2	0670030902	674038187	Red Rain (Luther Ewing Thriller)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Red Rain	See storyline above.<br />Michael Crow, a pseudonym of an apparently popular author, has a writing style that draws you in to the story and makes you part of it. This is the story of Luther Ewing. Luther is presently a detective for the Baltimore County Police Department. His past is a mystery to most of his friends and involves the Gulf war and his experiences with the special forces. When out of his past comes a certain old Russian mercenary named Vassily. Vassily seems to be taking over the drug trade in Luther's district and in his path he leaves death and destruction. Luther soon realizes that the only way to defeat Vassily is to veer a little outside the law.<br />Though just an average thriller, the writing style and knowledge of weaponry give it an edge that's worth reading. I was bothered by the fact that Vassily didn't have a clue that Luther was a detective.<br />Recommended.	2002-06-05

Storms and his rag-tag partners, to the rather naïve Jim Davenport, a low level white collar worker who decides to accept a transfer to Tampa, we soon discover the wackiness that surrounds the mind of Tim Dorsey. This wickedly hilarious romp through a minefield of guffaws will make you wish the book will never end. If you're not smiling while reading this novel you're probably laughing. The four old ladies were a riot. I very much look forward to the next Dorsey novel and wouldn't mind seeing old Serge again.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-29

This is one of his best adventures to date. Character driven non-stop suspense will keep you from putting this one down (I know that's a clich&eacute; but this book proves it). A well rounded thriller from an author one soon expects to see on the bestseller lists.<br />If you've ever flown, this will hit home.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-22

He believes the local mining company is causing illness and death (such as his wife's and father's), and is looking real hard for the reason to get the mine shut down. Not a real popular idea amongst the folks in town.<br />  Ellen Kroft is a retired school teacher who believes that a new vaccine that's being introduced nationwide (endorsed by the First Lady) is deadly.<br />  Nikki Solari, a coroner from Massachusetts, is in the town of Belinda to attend her best friend's funeral, when an attempt is made on her life. It seems she might have received some suspicious information about her best friend's death, and somebody wants that information real bad.<br />As these individuals come together in the story, you get a very exciting and suspenseful novel that should put Palmer on the top of his genre (I think he's already on the top). Lassa fever, Prion diseases and possible problems with vaccinations are just a few of the interesting topics covered. You'll enjoy many of the characters as well. I got a kick out of the dialogue with the mountain men.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-13

Not because it was good, but because there is a lot you can glance over and still not miss anything. Morrell seems to have become a bit subdued with this latest thriller, wich includes a few suspenseful parts and a lot of filler. With the quality of writing that Morrell has had in the past though, I'm not about to let his next novel go without reading it, hoping it's as good as his previous books.	2002-05-09

The people whom stand accused for this heinous crime are three US military men. Katherine Carlson, a highly intelligent and cunning civilian attorney, is representing one of the accused, a Thomas Whitehall, who doesn't stand much of a chance since the other two will testify against him. Katherine requests Major Sean Drummond to be the military co-council. Drummond takes on the job with some reservations. When Drummond was in law school, Katherine was a classmate and they constantly fought like cats and dogs. Never did they get along. So needless to say Drummond is quite baffled as to her choice of co-council. It turns out the case goes beyond just the murder and rape.<br />Brian Haig's witty first person narrative and a fast-paced story line, gets the reader highly involved and makes this a very good novel. The South Korean setting and gays in the military are two prominent themes in the story. A great military legal thriller.<br />Highly recommended	2002-05-06

Pineiro on top of my `must read' thriller list.<br />Bruce Tucker is ex-Navy Seal, ex-Secret Service and Ex-CIA operative. After losing his family to terrorists, which he also blames on the CIA, Tucker takes the job of protector/bodyguard to one of the richest computer gurus alive (think Gates) named Mortimer Fox. When Fox has a heart attack, after a failed attempt on his life, he passes on to Tucker a couple secrets and asks him to please protect his daughter. The same powerful forces that have been trying to kill him will now go after her. The big secret (Firewall) behind Mortimer Fox is a technology, which if discovered by another country, could trigger Armageddon. From launch codes to all the coded messages between intelligence agencies, nothing can be kept secret if the code to Firewall is acquired.<br />As much spy thriller as techno thriller. A better-rounded thriller you couldn't ask for. From computer technology to the possibilities of a North Korean invasion, all play a pivotal role in this non-stop thriller. At times it gets graphic (Cannibalism) and violent, but in the situations presented it's appropriate and not over done. This novel is very satisfying and should create some new fans for R.J. Pineiro.<br />Highly Recommended.	2002-04-27

The plot and storyline about plagues and life ending disasters combined with the biological sciences of cloning and genetics, along with a dose of pre-history, should spell bestseller. This one disappoints a bit. I didn't like the somewhat blocky writing style or lack of continuity. Though the story was very interesting, it just didn't grab me like a good thriller should. I really wanted to like this novel more. Maybe next time.<br />Recommended for the sci-fi buff.	2002-04-22

They call her the Dragon. This group is trying to overrun the Sierra Leone government. The Dragon's subsequent plan is then to destroy the USA with a secret weapon known as the Black Death (not the Black Death you're familiar with either). Ben Kamal and Danielle Barnea, in a most unusual way, get back together in an effort to stop the Dragon and her secret weapon. Of course this is just one of their problems. Old enemies also return.<br />The story also has numerous subplots that each come together to make this one of the most satisfying thrillers I've read in some time. From the civil war in Sierra Leone to the secret weapons factory in Russia, this novel carries you non-stop from beginning to end. The timely subject of the Middle East also plays a prominent role.<br />Quote: You do this out of hate for the enemy, not love of the people.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-04-10

Needless to say, she has no idea what she's soon to come up against: Sean Dillon, Blake Johnson, Harry and Billy Salter, Roper, Daniel Quinn and others.<br />A fast-paced thriller. The character of Sean Dillon is reminding me more and more of a character by the name of Dirk Pitt. You thriller readers know whom I'm talking about. Somehow you just know that no task is impossible. Of course Dirk still rules. This novel was comparable to the previous Dillon novels.<br />A suspenseful and quick read.<br />Recommended	2002-04-08

Sheri's mother was serving on a jury when she mysteriously died of what seemed to be salmonella poisoning. What Sheri wants to find out is whose fault it was. As McInnes and his partner, Joey, start researching the mother's death bad things start happening. Tom's life is now in danger. He gets blackmailed for murder and he also becomes disbarred. As he gets closer to the truth, death gets closer to him. With the help of an Asian-American doctor (psychology) who soon becomes a close female companion, and Joey, his trusting investigator, Tom works his magic and soon discovers the truth.<br />Stewart's way with words makes this novel one heck of a good read. A strong descriptive narrative invites one to visit Mobile, Alabama even in the dead of winter. A well plotted, fast moving story that I really enjoyed.<br />Highly Recommended.	2002-04-04

She agrees because she obviously needs the money. Little does she know the trouble she's getting into. Her husband is found murdered, and it seems to be because of some pictures he's taken. Having been a paparazzo, her dead husband seems to have made some powerful enemies. She's not afraid to find out who they might be.<br />A well written mystery.

The first person perspective of a female protagonist by a male author still throws me off a bit at the beginning, but soon I forget about it. As mentioned, the book moves fast.

As far as entertainment is concerned, James Rollins will fulfill your needs.<br />Nathan Rand is the main protagonist. He has lost both his mother and father to the dangerous Amazon. The government would like his help in finding the trail his father took four years ago. It seems a member of his father's original team has shown up alive after four years, but lives just long enough to say a few words to a shaman in a small Amazonian village. He also had a real arm in place of one that was amputated several years earlier. There is something out there that could change the world. Nathan's team includes Army Rangers as well as a group of scientists. The obstacles encountered will leave no man unscarred.<br />I just love stories like this. High adventure in the vain of Indiana Jones. The writing was so vivid it was like watching the big screen. It has fantasy with sci-fi, it has horror and mutations, and it covers the sciences from archeology to biology to evolution. Jaguars, anacondas, black caimans, piranhas, black ants, and one of the most vicious creatures, a woman called Tshui, are all part of the dangers (at least the normal dangers).<br />You'll enjoy this escape to the dangerous Amazon.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-03-29

This time around the INS, FBI and NYPD are using his expertise in capturing an infamous snakehead nicknamed the `Ghost'. Snakeheads are \\"smugglers crawling furtively through borders to deliver human cargo\\". When the `Ghost' destroys and sinks a ship carrying his cargo of Chinese dissidents--in an attempt to kill all on board-- Rhyme and his girlfriend Amelia Sachs, an NYPD officer, go in search of this mysterious criminal. Working with a philosophical Chinese police officer that survived the sinking, they discover that there are survivors and that the `ghost' is out to kill them.<br />Rhymes and Sachs's work with the crime scenes alone makes this top notch entertainment. The story of illegal Chinese immigrants and the reasons and hardships of some of their travels are somewhat eye-opening. The suspense and the mystery, as well as the unexpected turns, should help give this book, in my opinion, a spot on your shelf.<br />Highly recommended	2002-03-23

With the help of a rather accident prone pianist named Anna Rolfe, Gabriel treks all across Europe searching for these elusive paintings while avoiding assassins and the Swiss secret service. Secret documents and secret councils are just some of the surprises in this fast-paced international spy thriller. Silva paints a rather dark picture when it comes to Switzerland and their possible involvement with the Nazis and stolen treasures. A well researched novel with an ending that wasn't totally satisfying.<br />Daniel Silva is definitely one of the top thriller writers. Keep it up.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-03-17

One day while walking down the street he runs into his ex-brother-in-law. It's been about ten years since they've seen each other, so they chatted a bit. The next thing you know Eddie is given a pill to try. This `supposed' smart pill apparently does make him smarter but it also has some deleterious side effects. Death seems to surround this drug whether it's murder or the side effects.<br />The first half of the book seemed to move rather slowly, but the second half picked up the pace and made the book well worth the read. The whole concept of a smart drug was very intriguing. Eddie Spinola's character was likable but I didn't really care if anything happened to him. He was naïve about the drugs side effects and thinking ahead. The ending was left somewhat open. A good first novel with a not so good cover.<br />Recommended	2002-03-05

When the President decides to visit a top-secret base in the desert, known as Area 7, he stumbles upon some secrets he didn't even know about. Basically what happens is a large group of military soldiers from an elite squad in the Air Force take over Area 7 and kill almost everyone who is in charge of protecting the president. The mastermind behind this wants the president dead and has created a little game in which the president stands little chance of winning. Once the presidents heart stops beating, a device that was implanted, unknowingly, in his heart years ago, will cause a series of explosions (blast plasma warheads) at many of the busiest airports around the country. Needless to say, Scofield is one of the few survivors after the initial onslaught.<br />Matthew Reilly was quoted as saying that he likes to write \\"about action, thrills and adventure, and if developing characters slows down the action, then developing characters gets the chop\\". This is it in a nutshell. First suspend your beliefs, because when you get a hold of this relentlessly paced book it won't let up. It even comes with illustrations in case you don't have time to think. From chases in space to chases in lake Powell to the idea of racial viruses, it's a tremendously fun mindless read.<br />Highly recommended strictly for fun.	2002-02-23

I read it in two days and must say I really enjoyed it. Not a dull moment. Violence, action, vengeance, and some humorous dialogue drive this suspense-ridden novel to a satisfying conclusion.

After a love affair ends (not his choice), he becomes deeply depressed, suffering what he calls `the black dog', a term for depression coined by Winston Churchill. He returns to his childhood home in a small Illinois town to write a book about his childhood. Renting an abandoned childhood friends house, a friend who died in mysterious circumstances when he was eleven years old, some really strange things start to happen. Stewart starts to wonder whether he's going crazy or if these weird things are actually happening. Giant black dogs. Seeing dead people. Neo Nazis. Okay, the Nazis could be real.<br />I have not read the first book that takes place in the summer of 1960/61, where they are young kids. I think this book stands well by itself. I might have gotten more out of it if I'd read the first though.<br />It is written in a very stylish and enthralling way. There comes a point in the book where you as the reader, are not sure what's real and what isn't. You don't always know if the character is really that crazy or not. Is it reality or psychological? You'll have to decide.<br />Recommended	2002-02-12

I will agree that the story had me hooked, but I had to read through many pages that described nothing but feelings. Is it fast-paced? No. Is it a story with a lot of depth? Yes. I still recommend this as a good thriller because it tells a good story, even though it is a little verbose.	2002-02-09

He's assigned to write up an obit for one Jimmy Stoma (accidental death by drowning), lead singer for the old Jimmy and the Slut Puppies band; (this band had some song titles that went quite well with the band's name). While getting more information on the old band and talking to the widow, Tagger soon finds out that things are not as they seem. While investigating what he thinks is a murder, he also has to deal with his editor, who seems to be looking for a reason to fire him.<br />With the unique characters (Tagger's \\"loony death phobias\\") and the humorous dialogue created by Hiaasen, this book was a joy to read. I'll agree that it wasn't his funniest novel, but I still broke out in smile at times.<br />Highly Recommended.	2002-02-03

It was a little dry and not highly believable.<br />Kurt Ford is an ex Secret Service agent that used to protect Carter and Reagan. He is now a billionaire and founder of Safe-Tech, a very successful high-tech company. When his son, also a Secret Service agent, is found with a bullet in his head, Kurt is absolutely devastated.  The police believe it was suicide and don't intend to put any time in on the investigation. Kurt knows for a fact it was murder. He goes to an acquaintance of his who is working for the Secret Service and tries to get his help in getting information (This friend is also the man whom Kurt did not want working for him in his new company). With information this man gives him, Kurt is convinced that the president is responsible for his son's death. So Kurt decides to kill the president.<br />While a lot of the book deals with the emotional issues between Kurt and his fianc&eacute;, brought on by his son's death, some of the story deals in suspense. I felt the story was too predictable. From the beginning I knew who was behind the murders and that made the whole story frustrating. Kurt's gullibility didn't help. I've read all Tim Green's books and this is my least favorite...	2002-02-01

Press calls it something between the truth and a lie. It all depends on when and how you use it. Press is slightly left of center but gives a fairly even handed jab to all sides. Giving Clinton his due as the master of spin, followed closely by Bush (in politics).<br />A quote from the book about what makes news;<br />&quot;In his masterful biography of Hearst, David Nasaw explains the famous publisher's guiding principal: &quot;News is not a phenomenon that exists in the real world, waiting to be discovered...An event becomes news only when journalists and the editors decide to record it. More often than not, what determines whether an occurrence is noteworthy or not is the ease with which it can be plotted and narrated so that readers will want to read about it.&quot; Thus spin feeds the beast of corporate-driven journalists.&quot;<br />I'll leave you with one example of spin from the book:<br />Spin: &quot;I'm just an average American who found herself in a situation not of her own making.&quot;<br />--Linda Tripp<br />Translation: I'm going to get a book deal and I'll rat on my friend to do it.<br />Recommended	2002-01-26

Not his best but still quite enjoyable.<br />When Augustus McKnight gets lucky on one of his stocks and makes a significant profit he thinks it'll make things all better for him and  his wife. Wrong. Before he gets a chance to say anything she tells him she's leaving him and wants a divorce-it seems there is a greener pasture with her boss. The next day she is found murdered. He will be the beneficiary of a one million dollar life insurance policy taken out six months earlier. So he quits his regular job and decides to become a full time day trader. Needless to say there is a detective on his case as well as an insurance investigator. Now for some reason this seems very surprising to the, obviously very naïve, Augustus.<br />With some neat twists and turns, Frey has written an entertaining novel. The biggest flaw in this book (fairly significant) is the protagonist. Through most of the novel I could not have cared less about Augustus. As mentioned by other reviews, and to put it plainly, he was just too dumb to care about.<br />I kept waiting for him to get smart but the book ended before I got there.<br />Though the novel tells you a little about trading, it mostly deals with the murder mystery.	2002-01-23

In what they think is a foolproof plan, they talk themselves into stealing it. Well it wasn't foolproof. First of all, when they transfer the 3 million they receive quite a shock when they look at their deposit. Secondly a friend of theirs is shot and they are blamed. In the meantime two rogue secret service agents are after them as is a private investigator. How do you try to clear your name if indeed you're guilty?<br />I really enjoyed this fast-paced thriller. Of course, like everyone else, I thought of Grisham when reading this. Better than the new Grisham, comparable to the old. Laced with some humorous dialogue and some surprising twists. I think lovers of the thriller will like this one. Disneyland was a Hoot. The secret service's roll in this novel took me somewhat by surprise.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-01-22

It's a good international thriller that will remind you of early Ludlum.<br />Secret service agent Scot Harvath, an ex Navy Seal, is the only agent to survive an elaborate kidnapping of the president of the United States while on a skiing vacation in Utah. Though he saved the President's daughter, he also feels it's his duty to find out who was behind this very well thought out kidnapping, even if it means stepping on some toes and breaking some rules. The power behind the kidnappings eventually frame Harvath and soon everybody is looking for him.<br />Brad Thor has created a very visual thriller. His location descriptions are clear and accurate. From Lucerne to Bern, Thor takes you on an exciting, heart-pounding adventure. His super hero, Harvath, is sure to return for another adventure, which I certainly look forward to. If you like political intrigue and international thrills, I think you'll truly enjoy this first novel by Thor.	2002-01-13

Fascinating	If you're looking for a good biography on Howard R Hughes, look no further, because this is the one you'll want. Richard Hack writes in an open and laid-back manner making it all easy to enjoy and absorb. The subject manner certainly makes for entertaining reading itself. This most noted of eccentrics will captivate you as well as disgust you. Hack takes you inside the Hughes empire and paints a very good picture of the how and why of his world. If not for Hughes inheritance from his father-owner of the Hughes Tool Co-you most likely will never have heard of Howard Hughes. Basically Howard himself had no business acumen. His life does read somewhat like a fairy tale in that most of the things he wished for he got. From movie starlets to hotels and casinos. Money can truly buy most things. Unfortunately he wasn't psychologically stable for the last half of his life and this caused him and those around him much misery. Form whatever opinion you like about Hughes, but after reading this biography, the opinion you form will be a strong one. It was a well-written biography that lagged just a little on the editing.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-01-07

On the outside, Alexa is handling things.<br />Cannell takes you into the world of money laundering, drugs, and murder, while taking you into the deadly locales of South America. It was an entertaining and easy book to read. Itâs not hard to picture a movie out of this story (obviously due to Cannellâs scriptwriting abilities).

A decade where the market soared and technology boomed. A decade when scandal seemed to be on everyone’s mind and on everyone’s TV.<br />A good portion of this book involves Clinton and his escapades. Other portions talk about technology and its affect on everything from the sciences, where the genome is being mapped, to the Internet, and its web over the country.  The popularity of scandal TV and reality TV get quite a bit of mention also. From the O.J. debacle to the Monica story. Is it the dumbing down of the media for the public or the other way around?<br />Johnson has summarized the nineties fairly well. This brief history covers quite a bit of territory and is written in a concise and readable way.<br />If you’ve kept up with the times, you won’t learn anything new here, but it will bring back some either good or bad memories.	2001-12-26

The uniqueness lies in the fact that each of the authors didn’t know the storyline until it was his/her turn to write a chapter.

This time around he writes a somewhat scathing story of Nashville and the country music industry.<br />It seems as though Fitzhugh’s novels are becoming progressively less funny (laugh out loud). They may be less funny but the stories are still fun to read. Even though this story has no laugh out loud parts it is dosed with some little humorous gems (Jimmy’s description of a Gulf Coast casino as feeling like he was in a Dukes of Hazard pinball machine). Fender Benders is an entertaining and eye opening look at the workings of the country music industry and will make you look at Nashville in a whole new light.<br />Recommended.	2001-12-19

After the first mission fails she returns to London to look for recruits for a brave new plan that will take them into the exchange itself. These recruits will be comprised of nothing but females (and quite a group this turns out to be).<br />Dieter Franck is the German, working under Rommel, who is set out to stop the resistance movement. He soon becomes Flickâs archenemy. Dieter is a skilled interrogator and a ruthless torturer who has a knack of getting the truth out of his enemies.<br />The cat and mouse scenario between Flick and Dieter drives this novel to its very satisfying conclusion. It has an odd assortment of characters, some youâll like and some youâll hate. This is not one of Follettâs more memorable novels but it is still worth your time if youâre a fan. The plot didnât really draw me in until the second half of the book, and thatâs when it grabbed hold and wouldnât let go. I will continue to be a Follett fan.<br />Recommended.	2001-12-13

He is well respected and thought of as a hero. On his latest mission this all changes. He has unknowingly led his squad of 6 into an ambush and they are all killed. He survived. The bad thing is, he froze before entry and he doesn’t know why. This squad included his many good friends. Few know the truth, but most look at him as somewhat of a coward, including the media. His personal job now is to find out who was behind this ambush. Was it a group of neo nazis?  Could it have been the local drug kingpin?<br />Many different issues are touched on in this well-rounded thriller. The character study of Web London is lengthy and in depth. Yes, in this thriller Baldacci gets more touchy-feely than his other thrillers, but this also is a bonus in that it adds depth --great depth-- to the character. The challenges of the HRT (hostage rescue team), of the FBI are touched on and quite interesting. A satisfying story with some unique characters.<br />Highly recommended for Baldacci fans as well as thriller fans.	2001-12-08

Mostly young teenagers. This is when Texas rangers' Travis and Manny get on the case.<br />The story should be aimed at parents and teenagers. A rather moral tale that describes some of the perils of teenage drug use. There is suspense to go with the emotion. It's also laced with humor, especially when it comes to Manny and Travis. Being a short novel, as this was, it did lack some depth but it still kept me in my chair.	2001-12-05

After all this was real â~survivorâ. It was, without a doubt, a very entertaining story. Action, mystery, and a little lovinâ, will keep the reader racing to the end to solve the mystery.

More like his earlier works, yet there is quite a bit of originality and uniqueness to this one. With exciting locales such as Vienna, Buenos Aires, Zurich and Paris, it’s hard to get bored. This is a well-plotted story involving a conspiracy so powerful (Sigma), nobody is beyond its grasp. It seems much of Ludlum’s wisdom, as well as research, went into this novel. An interesting story that will raise your eyebrows as well as your adrenaline.

More a murder mystery than legal thriller. Margolin's story of a young associate will keep you reading at a steady pace, because if you don't read this in one or two sittings, you're apt to forget who certain characters are. I think Margolin's previous novels put this one to shame. This novel was just a little to short to accomodate this type of story line.

This time around it revolves around Hollywood. The old and the new. Barker’s stories generally involve all sorts of depravities. This one definitely has its share. Explicit sex, along with stunning and shocking visuals, lets you know you’re reading a Barker novel. Barker seems to create a great depth to his stories, and this is no exception. A ghost story that portrays Hollywood as a sort of sexual asylum. The talent that Barker has in bringing you into his fantasy worlds exceeds that of most contemporary horror writers, as well as most novelists. The violence as well as the sexual explicitness (nothing forbidden), will bring out a weird range of emotions in the reader, so beware.<br />Highly recommended, even though I liked the UK cover much better.	2001-11-02

His divorced lesbian sister is the one in need of repair on this go round, though Joe and Stan, the arsonists from a previous novel, do make a rather large cameo appearance (and then disappearance).<br /> I usually rate Wilson's novels with five stars, but this just didn't have the oomph I'm used too. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, it lacked certain repairs. Sure there was suspense, and it sure moved at a quick pace, but this supernatural thriller didn't have quite enough closure. I will, of course, read the next novel in this series, with just a little apprehension, not much, just a little. I think the editors at Forge slipped a little bit also with some of the spelling. One more gripe. There is no microwave oven, in home, that will run 99 hours.<br />Still highly recommended...because it's F. Paul Wilson.	2001-10-26

Not a bad story but nothing I would go out of the way to recommend.<br />Billy Strobe came from a rather broken family. His father was a good attorney but committed suicide when Billy was 12. His mother is an alcoholic and his sister has MS. While his mom and sister are living in a trailer in Enid, Oklahoma, Billy is serving time in prison because of a little thing known as insider trading. Billy manages to earn his law degree through correspondence courses and becomes the 'prisoners lawyer'. Billy is released early and hired by a fairly demanding law firm. He spends most of his time trying to get a new trial for his friend in prison, whom he believes is innocent, while also trying to clear his dead fathers smeared reputation.<br />While overall a good story, the character of Billy Strobe, to me, was not likeable. His overly ambitious efforts to prove the innocence of his friend in prison cost innocent lives on the outside. This was not worthy of praise. His efforts to clear his fathers name was.<br />This book will be enjoyed by most legal thriller fans.<br /><br />Maybe my mood just wasn't into this kind of story. It's happened before.	2001-10-16

This novel, in my opinion, puts Vince Flynn in the big leagues with Ludlum and Clancy.<br />CIA director Thomas Stansfield has died. In line to get his job is Dr. Irene Kennedy, who is currently heading the CIA's counter-terrorism unit. There are some powerful people who do not want to see Kennedy become director. In the meantime, Mitch Rapp, a 32-year-old operative, is on a mission to try to find out who tried to have him killed when he was in Germany. This leads him to Italy where he looks up an old girlfriend/assassin. This is where the bodies start piling up. On his return to the USA, he's asked to do a final job. He accepts. Through information from the Mossad, it is learned that Saddam Hussein has three working nuclear weapons. These weapons are hidden under a large hospital in Baghdad. Rapp's job is to destroy or steal these weapons without innocent casualties.<br />With a rather complex plot that creates wars between different politicians, as well as other countries, Vince Flynn has delivered a fantastic story. Everything is covered. From Arab-Israeli relations to the powerful workings of Washington D.C.  From the Mossad to Saddam Hussein and his family. A well rounded, fast-paced, well written novel.<br />Highly recommended	2001-10-16

I must say it was well worth it. It had a certain originality I truly enjoyed.<br />Hap Collins and Leonard Pine are two good oleâ boys from East Texas working as security guards at a huge chicken processing plant. Although Leonard is black and gay and Hap is straight and white, they are as close as brothers. When Hap saves the life of the ownerâs daughter, he is given a substantial reward, as well as time off for him and Leonard to go on vacation. They opt for a Caribbean cruise that doesnât bring much relaxation. First theyâre abandoned, and then theyâre mugged. They could have been killed, but an old man and his machete save them. Hap gets involved with the old mans daughter and soon finds that this family is having some major problems.<br />Murders, kidnappings, and a wide assortment of odd characters and situations are played out in a way that gives this work of fiction a fresh originality. As secrets are revealed the body count begins. Hap and Leonard seem to find trouble wherever they go and that keeps the entertainment factor high. Itâs rude and itâs crude and itâs incredibly fun to read. Joe R. Lansdale will be on my must read list.<br />Highly recommended for guys who like a crude and fun ride.	2001-10-01

It seems a state of the art cruise ship named 'Emerald Dolphin' is experiencing a major fire. The radios, as well as the sprinkler system, has been sabotaged and the lifeboats have been burned. Dirk must now rescue over 2000 people. This amazing rescue, along with 3 or 4 others in the novel, seem to be somewhat miraculous, but they sure are fun to read. As a multi-billionaire attempts to take over the oil business and eventually the government, Dirk has his work cut out for him.<br /> Dirk, and his long time friend Al Giordino, get together once again in this entertaining and fast-paced story. This well rounded and well researched novel includes tales of the old Vikings and Norsemen. Jules Verne also plays a part in this story.

Ethan Black returns with a great novel that's even better than `Irresistible'. A timely thriller that holds nothing back<br />When Conrad Voort meets up with an old best friend named Meechum Keefe at a tavern in Greenwich Village, he finds that his friend is scared and paranoid. Meechum gives Voort a list of five names and addresses and asks him to find something that ties these names together. The next day Voort finds Meechum is missing, and with the only clue he has to go on, he starts investigating the list. Voort soon finds out that there is very little to tie the people on the list together. The first three on the list seem to have died in separate accidents. The last two are still alive, for now. When Voort tries to locate the last two people, he realizes there lives are in danger. When he locates number four, a beautiful doctor, he falls in love. He soon makes a connection. It seems that terrorism might tie all these people together.<br />Terrorists and secret organizations all play a crucial role in this well crafted and very well written thriller. From the descriptive narrative to the tight dialogue, this story puts you in the center. Very entertaining and very involving. I very much look forward to Ethan Black's future novels.<br />Highly recommended.<br />Inside the covers:<br />A scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim, so he asks a frog to carry him across.

After numerous delays, I'm glad that Robin Cook's latest finally made it to the bookshelves. It wasn't quite worth the wait.<br />When Deborah Cochrane and Joanna Meissner, two college grad students, decide to sell their eggs, it seemed like a good idea, after all it paid 45,000 dollars per person. This money would be enough for them to get a condo, and travel to Venice for a year to work on their theses. The Wingate Clinic, which offered the money, performed this procedure in an afternoon, with apparently no problems.<br />A year down the road when they return from Venice, Joanna becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her eggs, even though this went against the agreement with the clinic. Well of course Deborah had to help her obsessed friend find out. Big mistake. One of many to come.<br />Cook's latest medical thriller is not quite up to par, and not what I would expect from him. In the medical thriller genre, there are quite a few authors that can provide a better book than this (Palmer, Gerritsen). I had no compassion at all for the protagonist's of this story. Deborah and Joanna's ideas for breaking into the clinics computers or disguising themselves for employment made it hard to believe they were college graduate students. When committing felonies, one does not leave so much evidence as they did. Two clueless characters. This timely and controversial subject could have been written with much more depth and adventure. I wonder if this was actually written by Cook, and why is there a ten-year-old picture on the jacket and not a newer one?<br />Lightly recommended for the die hard Cook fan.	2001-09-12

His last victim, Dr. Cordell, fought back and killed him.<br />Now living in Boston and working as a trauma center doctor, Catherine Cordell soon finds out about some recent rapes and murders happening in the Boston area that are very similar to the ones committed by Andrew Capra, the man she killed 2 years ago. This killer starts sending her clues, which causes her to recapture all those hideous moments of the past. She soon finds out that she may be the final target.<br />Detective Thomas Moore is a rather easygoing guy (with a growing attachment to Cordell) assigned to these recent killings, along with lead detective Rizzoli, who happens to be a women struggling to prove herself to a mostly male police force.<br />Filled with well-choreographed emergency room action and engrossing scenes of life and death, this novel does not disappoint.

He has survived over 11 years in Attica with a 10,000-dollar bounty on his head, which was offered by the Mosque brothers when he killed one of their own. After his release he decides to offer his services to the local mafia don, Byron Farino. It seems Farino's accountant has gone missing. When Farino decides to hire Kurtz, that's when the fireworks start. The 10,000-dollar bounty offered to kill Kurtz is still payable on the outside; so on top of looking for the missing accountant, Kurtz is dodging bullets from an assortment of bad guy's. Everyone from the drug lords, to the Alabama Beagle Boys, seem to be after a piece of the Kurtz pie.<br />A fast-paced and oft times violent novel. The character of Joe Kurtz seemed to lack depth. The story itself must have lacked a little depth because it read like a sequel. I liked the varied characters and the quick and snappy dialogue. No wasted speech here.<br />Overall an easy to enjoy, quick read, delivered by an author that's done better work.<br />Recommended.	2001-09-07

There is a huge hole in the ozone layer on the South American coast in the area of the Galapagos Islands. Because of this depletion the local governments have had to put up electronic billboards advising you of your \\"minutes to burn\\". In March of 2002, a 9.2 magnitude earthquake, dubbed the `Initial Event', struck the region.<br />Dr. Rex Williams is the ecotectonist assigned to place 6 Gps units on a small island in the Galapagos called Sangre de Dios to study seismic events. Also along with Williams is a differing group of Navy Seals--one ex-Navy--assigned to protect him. When a genetically mutated creature is discovered on the island, all hell soon breaks loose.<br />Hurwitz has written an in-depth and highly researched scientific thriller that reminds me more of `Predator' than anything else. The characters were described with a depth that made you feel you were there. Hurwitz also gives you a good idea of how fragile the ecology of these island are and how simple new species are introduced. I loved the science and I loved the action. Only rarely predictable. The Darwin virus described, with its massive range of DNA seems quite implausible. But is it truly?<br />Highly Recommended.	2001-09-05

USS America is Americas newest nuclear powered submarine armed with tomahawk missiles. The 2 billion dollar sub, which is carrying 134 men, is hijacked on its maiden voyage and soon disappears into the Atlantic Ocean. The terrorist who has taken the USS America, starts firing missiles at Washington D.C. and New York City in separate attacks. These specific tomahawks are called Flashlight missiles or E-missiles. When detonated over a city it releases a strong electromagnetic pulse and makes everything running on electricity virtually useless making the city shutdown. When this happens, political, psychological, and financial upheaval occurs. Rear Admiral Jake Grafton soon learns there is a connection between the lost satellite and the stolen submarine. Grafton, along with his aide Toad Tarkington, have there work cut out for them in this well rounded thriller that gives you a lot of detail with a lot of action. What you have here is a story of superpower politics, cutting edge technology, and greed (as quoted by Grafton). Throw in some Russian and European spies with a few computer hackers and you have yourself a heck of a story. I liked Coonts' previous novel `Hong Kong' a little better than this one.

As the current governor, Conrad is running against house speaker Gomer Tatum, a Democrat who doesn't seem to have much of a chance at winning. When Conrad is called to duty and sent to the Balkans on a peacekeeping mission, what he witnesses changes his life. On his return he surprises many of his colleagues by renting a Winnebago-The Orange Crush-and starts touring the state of Florida by visiting the families of his slain friends which he served with in the Balkans. During his tour his polls are climbing and falling, back and forth. You never know what he's going to do next. With him on this tour is Gottfried Escrow, who is his chief of staff and would do anything to discredit Gomer. Pimento is also along for the ride as Conrad's press secretary. Pimento has amnesia and he's not sure who he is. This story is filled with many unique characters.  Bab's, fianc&eacute; to Marlon, has a neat little trick she likes to use when making love; I'll just say it has to do with ventriloquism and Howdy Doody. Helmut Von Zeppelin's experience with his football team was quite hilarious also.<br /> From serial killers to tennis stars, this book is an all around fun time to read.

Eventually Fritz decides he should do something about this murder, or at least find out who's responsible. As Fritz soon learns, he's in way to deep.<br />  One would think that Fritz is smart, but being a professor of history does not make him a good detective. He seems to lack the ability to read people well. His way with the ladies seems a little too lucky. Fritz also seems to carry a lot of emotion around with him.

The closest escape is a house by the road. A father and his two children are held hostage. As it turns out, they couldn't have picked a worse family to hold hostage. In steps Talley as the man in charge of the scene, hoping to pass that on to the county sheriff's department as soon as he can. A homicidal killer and the mob all play a key roll in this top-notch thriller.<br />Robert Crais' latest novel flows with suspense from beginning to end. During the last third of the story you'll be looking for your seat belt. Even though it had some stupid criminals and a not so smart local mobster (his plan to get the disc's seemed ludicrous), the story pulled you in and kept you reading.

A group from the Special Forces A-Team is arrested for this atrocity. Sean Drummond, a JAG lawyer, is put in charge of the investigation, to find out whether it was self-defense or outright murder. With his witty and smart-alecky way, Drummond weaves from cover-up to cover-up in what seems an endless pursuit of justice.<br />I felt really comfortable reading this book. The writing style was fluid. There was not as much suspense as other military thrillers but the manner in which Drummond investigated and interviewed potential suspects kept me on edge. I got a pretty clear picture on the Serbian/Albanian relations and some of the politics involved with NATO operations. Military operations with the KLA brought some insight also.<br />Overall a satisfying read, especially for military buffs.<br />Inside the covers:<br />He said, “Sometimes those principles they teach at West Point about duty and honor and country, sometimes they clash against one another.

Thus begins Jon Smiths desperate attempt to find out what Yuri knew that cost him his life.<br />This is what I consider good escapist fiction. International locales with some space shuttle action thrown in, drives this somewhat complex thriller. The idea behind this biological thriller, is using an altered smallpox virus with no possible vaccine, in warfare. Sure it stretches reality but that's what escapist fiction is all about. The motivation behind some of the powerful figures in this plan are??? I'm not sure.<br />Non-stop action and suspense.<br />Recommended for thriller fans who want to escape.	2001-08-01

Almost 2 years ago Umberto Alvarez lost his wife and twins in a collision with a train, where the blame was ultimately put on his wife. Alvarez thinks differently and believes that Northern Union Railroad is at fault and is covering up some major problems. He want's to get even. Peter Tylers pursuit of this so called terrorist drives this story and brings it to it's exciting conclusion.<br />The action and romance move this story at a somewhat average pace. For some reason this latest Pearson novel just doesn't have the oomph I'm used to. More idle time than suspense could be a factor or the simple fact that some of the characters had little depth.<br />Recommend...Library first	2001-07-30

An Air TransSouth flight has crashed in the mountains of North Carolina killing all eighty-eight people on board. Near the accident scene Tempe finds a foot with no other body parts around it. It turns out this foot does not belong to anybody on the plane. From who’s body does this foot originate? Why are people trying to stop her investigation?<br />As Kathy Reichs takes you on this highly detailed investigative ride, you’ll learn much about forensics and science on the way. I like that. To be both entertained and educated. I did learn just a little more than I needed to about VFA’s (volatile fatty acids), but it was fun anyway. Overall this was a good medical and forensics procedural with a lot of neat information.<br />A word of advice:  If you get a death threat, it’s best not to go running at night, even if you do have a dog.<br />Inside the covers:<br />Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an  Englishman.

Or was it a combination of both; Racial genetics?<br /> Madriani and Hinds do what they can in this rather lackluster effort by Steve Martini. A fairly slow-paced, very average legal novel like this is not what I expected from Martini. This was a dry Martini. It also seems to me that the title was chosen before the book was written.

The character of Patrick Wallington as a woman loving reporter, though not highly likable, did grow on you. At times laugh out loud funny.At times not totally sensible. The story line did have a uniqueness only John Irving could bring to paper. I did enjoy the first half of the novel more, simply because there was more going on. Wallington's trip to japan--for the 'Future of Women' conference--was hilarious, as were some of his other rendezvous'. The subplot involving Dr. Zajac and his problems drew me in too. The character of Doris Clausen seemed rather shallow and I found it hard to believe that Wallington could even fall in love with this lady. The book did lack emotion and depth with some of the characters, but the plot and comical farce made up for some of that. An overall fun and quick read for the summer.<br />Recommended.	2001-07-18

The brilliant but also very much hated Judge Calvin Jeffries is found murdered in a courthouse parking lot. A couple months later another prominent judge is found murdered in the same location and in the same manner. A different homeless man is arrested for each murder in what seems to be open and shut cases. Attorney Joseph Antonelli decides to defend the accused in the murder of the last judge and soon discovers nothing is as it seems.<br />This was a very engrossing read for me. I also feel that this is one of the top ten in this genre, as opined by a previous reviewer. The writing style drew me in as much as the story. Smooth and captivating dialogue really kept me reading all night. A finely written legal/mystery thriller with plenty of emotion and mystery that will make you want to bring the book with you wherever you go till you finish. It’s that good.<br />Inside the covers:<br /> Oh where is the noble fear of modesty, or the strength of virtue, now that blasphemy is in power and men have put justice behind them, and there is no law but lawlessness and none join in fear of the Gods.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-07-14

This woman, Carmen Greer, seems to have quite a story to tell and wants Reacher help. It seems her husband is being released from prison for a stretch he did on tax evasion, and if her story is to be believed, he’s a very abusive husband and she needs help desperately. After a few tricks by Reacher to find out if Carmen is telling the truth, he agrees to help. So what’s next? Twists and turns with some great action and a very intelligent killing crew.<br />Lee Child has written another fine Reacher Novel. It was fast-paced and filled with some neat twists.

Well you don’t just quit the mob. While living in Aspen, he finds out he’s been misdiagnosed and actually has no cancer at all. He turns to Cole Springer, an ex-secret service agent, for protection. Unfortunately, Springer desperately needs the money to avoid the bank repossessing his tavern, and takes the job.  The action begins.<br />This novel was great fun to read. A sort of Elmore Leonard/Bill Fitzhugh mix, that’s filled with unique characters. Ray Dean and Auteen, two mismatched thugs, were a riot to listen too. Max Shapiro had the Joe Pesci type personality from Lethal Weapon, which was hilarious. Then of course there is Cole Springer, a hero who’s hard not to like.<br />Great dialogue and nonstop entertainment filled with just the right amount of humor, makes this crime drama fun to read. W.L. Ripley will go on my must read list.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-06-28

David Haines is the death row inmate with the super immune system along with a fanatical religious belief that will not allow him to give his blood. He's on death row for killing numerous doctors. Dr. Laura Donaldson's attempts to acquire a sample of his blood through legal means backfires when Haines makes a somewhat predictable escape from prison. Kevin Sheldrake, the FBI agent who captured Haines the first time, is on the case again. Can they capture him alive?<br />With a gritty edge of suspense and a little background on cancer and cults, this makes for some entertaining summer reading. You'll see the depths reached by religious fanaticism and the fervor of a scientist with a goal. The ending was left open for a sequel and, to me, a little disappointing.<br />Recommended.	2001-06-21

During the healing process she notices certain things seem to be happening with her, such as nightmares, new food tastes, Russian poetry popping into her head, a hotter temper, a new ability to drive well at high speeds and a certain phone number that keeps coming into her mind.<br />On the other side of town is Jeff Hammond, a disgraced former FBI agent, now a Washington Post reporter. Jeff is on the trail of a former KGB agent.<br />What ties these two protagonists together is what brings this story its unique plot. Cellular Memory, a supposed closer link between the brain and the heart involving neurotransmitters. This premise itself could make for an exciting story, but when you throw in everything from assasination attempts to Russian history, brainwashed fanatics to double agents, you end up with a well researched novel riddled with intrigue. I thinks it's quite comparable to Ludlum.<br />Highly Recommended.<br />Inside the Covers:<br />The secret of human life, the universal secret, the root secret from which all other secrets spring, is the longing for more life.

Though William Bernhardt takes you on a twisty turny ride in this newest novel, it just doesn't match up to his previous work. The courtroom scenes are as good as ever.

While flying all over Europe to evade this legitimate warrant for arrest, the reader is treated to some suspenseful reading and some interesting cat and mouse ploys. This is a fast paced action thriller with some political overtones. Most of the action and descriptions seem to come from a knowledgeable pilot/author, but I truly must question one glaring error I noticed in the book that a pilot would never make. Squawk 266.....9?

The locations in Alaska and the flashbacks to NYC all helped to bring a little more substance to this story. The characters did come of as a little shallow in my opinion. I also think a little more history could have been wrapped in the story.

It started out with all the classic Stephen King elements. As I progressed with the novel I began to change my mind. For one thing I think it was to long. Normally, as with classic King, the longer the better, but this story seemed to drag a bit at times. At times it also becomese a little confusing as to the perspective of the narrative. Such as when, where and who this perspective is coming from. An enjoyable novel overall for the true Stephen King fan and it's better than a couple of his previous novels, but it just isn't comparable to 'The Stand' or 'It'.<br />Recommended for Stephen King fans.	2001-04-04

Not only will you be educated about history, but you'll get a good idea about what's behind some of the mystery concerning the pyramids and other structures. Ancient cultures are brought to light in an adventerous fashion. The book combines many genres. From 'Indiana Jones' to 'Men In Black'. From '2001' to 'Independence Day'. It leaves nothing out.

The cat and mouse thrills are here, as is the suspense. When I started reading the book I was thinking of comparing it to Baldacci. The further I got into it the more I decided I was wrong. Though the action is exciting, it's a little far fetched. Some of the scenes actually made me stop reading and say to myself, &quot;Yea, right&quot;. The entertainment value is there if you can swallow some of the action scenes. I think with each novel, Alan Jacobson's writing improves.<br />Recommended.	2001-02-20

A story of how the past can influence the future. I thought it was very good. A psychological thriller with great depth to the characters. Written in such a manner that you can actually feel how most of the characters feel. At times deeply emotional and compassionate, at other times, suspenseful and thrilling. As the editor says, 'It's not just a whodunit, it's a why they 'dunit'. After reading this novel, I intend on putting Mr. Lehane on my reading list.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-02-18

Though it moves at a steady pace and has a gripping storyline, it just somehow lacks the suspense that I expect from him.

I've read one previous Connelly novel and thought the same of it. I guess if I would have read all his previous novels with both Bosch and McCaleb, my opinion would be different, but just by itself, it's average. It was interesting learning about the actual painter by the name of Heironymus Bosch-who's theme has a major role in this novel-and his rather gruesome paintings. The book did have a steady pace with a better than average ending that I enjoyed.<br />Recommended for mystery/procedural buffs.	2001-02-12

The characters all had their own personal feelings and their own agendas in regards to this issue. It's interesting to see just how this one issue can raise ones emotions to the point of excess. Mr. Patterson has written an engaging novel that involves some touchy subjects. With arguments presented on both sides, he has done an outstanding job. Protect and Defend is a good book with some strong characters.  I recommend this book to readers who like to get the insight on how Washington DC works and to readers who like a good argument.<br />Recommended	2001-02-09

I know it sounds cliched, but it really grabbed me from the start and wouldn't let go. This book is definitely best read in one to three sittings because it is a little complex sometimes.

The story moves at a good pace and provides plenty of thrills and some graphic violence. The lead character, Tom McInnes, seems to smart off quite a bit when he's surrounded by the enemy, which seems somewhat stupid, but other than that he's quite likable. An overall smoothly written novel laced with humor and bodies. I'm looking forward to the follow up to this novel, which is obviously to be expected, because of the unexpected....<br />Recommended for thrills and mystery.	2001-02-04

This book has everything I like.  Suspense, thrills, international locales, and most of all a writing style that fits the story. Story includes old nazis mixed in with international business, psychics, and small town life in the florida swamps. Unusual characters and unique settings set this thrller apart from most others.

I didn't get a chance to read the first Nikki Hill novel 'The Trials of Nikki Hill',so the character of Nikki seemed a little shallow. Overall though, the book reads well by itself. The story moves at a steady pace until the action packed finale, which was entertaining, yet surprising. The relationship between Nikki and Virgil seemed a bit contrived. Didn't seem to have much chemistry holding them together. Overall a nice effort by Lochte and Darden.<br />Recommended for legal thriller fans.	2001-01-23

It moves at a fairly good pace and keeps you guessing until the end. There are deceptions and coverups and a whole lot of insight into the White House. The character of Michael Garrick was hard to like because he seemed so pliable.

Well, I got the drama. The pace lagged at times but because of Mr. Koontzs' writing style it was still great entertainmment. Such prose.<br />Although a little too spiritual, the fantasy Mr. Koontz has written has enough mystery and suspense to push it to the top of the bestseller lists. Some of the unique characters in the book include the brothers Jacob and Edom. Jacob is obsessed and knows all about man made disasters while Edom is the same about natural disasters. There are many characters in this novel with their own unique philosophies. The evil protaganist, Junior Cain, with a rather unorthodox way of recalling something, was a follower of the philosopher Caesar Zedd, whom I found to have some rather interesting outlooks on life.<br />At times emotionally gripping and full of surprises. At times preachy and annoying. A different sort of novel for Dean Koontz which should generate some new fans, and at the same time maybe lose some. Me? I look forward to what comes next.<br />Lightly Recommended	2001-01-12

The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the main player in this book and Daniel Silva knows this topic well.

The pace moves steadily all the way to the somewhat predictable ending. The thrills are here, as is the suspense. For a first novel I think Mr. Samuel is on the right track. A couple things bothered me about the book, thus affecting the whole story. First is Mr. Montgomery's plan to keep multi-billionaire Sam Baldwin from going through with his assassination attempt. A kidnapping just seemed too amatuerish for this powerful man. Secondly what bothered me, was Sarah Peterson's assignment by the president to head security for the Secretary of State. Why her? Why now? Why didn't she? After her recording session she completely stayed away from him. At the time she had no reason to stay away. Seemed contrived. Of course that's just my opinion.<br />For a first novel I recommend this to political thriller fans and I look forward to Steve Samuels next effort.	2001-01-01

Sarah Leonard is in charge of getting a luxury hotel built in the city. When a few workers are killed, the other workers refuse to go back work until the murderer is caught (or the Devil as they call it). Detective Rej is in charge of the homicides and can't seem to find any connection between all the killings around the city. When a connection comes to light, it's to late, because he's been dropped from the case. Sarah decides to hire a detective from the states who's supposed to have great success in criminal investigations. Clayton Marsh is his name. It turns out that all the murders seem to be related to an event in the past.<br />Overall a captivating read. I found the character of Clayton Marsh, who supposedly had a brilliant mind, to be quite stupid. To search the sewers, knowing you'll meet the killer, without a weapon?

The protaganist Bryson gets into so many life and death situations during his deep cover operations, which he obviously always escapes, that you don't worry about him dying when he gets into another one. Bryson is definitely one of those heroes that's almost impossible to kill. This does make for great thrills though, because, as quoted above this review, this is escapist fiction. Nonstop, blood pulsing, twisting, turning, highspeed, whos who, back stabbing and front stabbing Action! One heck of a ride. Sure there are some flaws. How can you make a simple mistake like not knowing that the previous nights weather was severe storms (when they were running old footage over live footage).

Just when you think you have it figured out and start cheering on the good guys, you read a little more and go oops! wrong one. Or is it? A good book with a lot of suspense and colorful characters. How about that Donald Sales guy, and what he does to prove a point? I also enjoyed the ending. Overall a very satisfying read.

Not a lot of mystery, but quite a bit of suspense, made this story a quick read. The love story angle seemed to be a bit overdone to my liking, especially during a rather gruesome investigation of a serial murderer, who it appears, tortures single parent children before he kills them. There certainly aren't any happily married couples in this story. Overall, a highly graphic, yet satisfying read. Obviously written with a sequel in mind.<br />Recommended	2000-10-06

It packs a ton of action with an outstanding locale. You'll actually find yourself cheering for the good guys with enthusiasm. The two different plots in the book are weaved together with a fine touch. Jake Grafton must rescue his wife from a greedy criminal while at the same time rebels are trying to overrun the communists.

The novel moved at a fast pace and kept me reading into the night (as usual, for Leonard). The originality of the characters was refreshing as was the dialogue and humor. The massacres in Rwanda drew a sharp contrast compared to the activities in Detroit where most of the humor took place. I think Leonard pulled this contrast off real well and thus gave it an originality you don't often see.<br />Truly entertaining<br />Highly recommended.	2000-09-29

This was a true pleasure to read. Characters such as Johnny Vegas and his attempts at  losing his virginity, too Boris 'the hateful piece of s###', lend an  originality I find refreshing. Though most characters are a bit shady, you  can't help but feel a little compassion for them.

Earl Swagger does not let his impending fatherhood get in the way as  he deals with evils and betrayals and a rising body count.<br />I enjoyed this  book as much as his previous books. The writing jumps out at you like your  at a movie watching it all unfold. The history of Hot Springs (though here  made more violent, because afterall, its a Swagger novel) was quite  interesting.

Once you take the elixir, you take it for life, or die a horrible death. There are quite a few things to think about in this book and Gary Braver pretty much hits on all the  consequences of most decisions. The pace of the book is fast.

Exhilarating, suspenseful and drop dead readable.Mark Beamon is a suspended  special agent for the FBI who has a reputation for finding people who don't  want to be found. He is hired by an unknown client, whos willing to pay  well, to find a world class rock climber that happened to acquire top  secret files that could topple some very high level politicians.This book  was a great enjoyment to read. The hatred you'll feel towards Hallorin and  his 'at all costs' run for the presidency, to the chuckles you'll have as  Darby and Beamon ski there way to the tower, are just a couple of emotions  you'll have while reading this book.There is very little filler or  superfluous narration to bog you down.The ending, to me, was a little  disappointing, but yet, justice was served. Keep'em coming Mr. Mills Highly  recommended..	2000-05-09
2505567:US	52150226	R3QXX60MV1JCFD	0671041401	554020976	The Shot	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Not real thrilling	Philip Kerr's latest involves Americas deadliest assassin Tom Jefferson. Jefferson is hired by the mob to kill Castro. After accepting money for the job, he happens across a secret recording of JFK having a go at his wife (who happens to work on JFK's campaign). This causes Jefferson to change  targets. Due to his failure to follow through with the Castro  assassination, the Mob now targets him.<br />The novel takes place in 1960 and  '61 and has been researched real well. From the songs that were popular to  the talk shows and movies (Psycho). The novel lacks suspense. We know no  assassination takes place in '60 or '61. It also lacks a protagonist to  cheer for. Most characters in the novel are crooked and corrupt. The  reading was dry.<br />Philip Kerr's previous novels 'Esau' and 'A five year  plan' were, in my opinion, much better books. As a thriller writer, I feel  Philip Kerr has slipped a notch with this latest  effort.<br />Recommendation...Library	2000-04-30

Mr. Edelman explains it in an easy to understand way. The reason I say not to waste your money is this. Each secret has a chapter  with an average length of 11.5 pages. So basically the good information is  in about 90 some pages. The rest of the book is filled with the authors'  clients telling you how they do the things that the book says. In my  opinion this should be a 100 page book at the most. It took me 2 hours to  get all the valuable information out of this book(it is good information).  I think the author expanded most of his energy trying to sell you his other  books by the numerous footnotes telling you to by his other books. He was  trying to be humorous most of the time with the footnotes but it became  annoying.<br />My recommendation is..The library	2000-04-26

It surprised me somewhat to learn how aggressive and cunning Geffen was. The back stabbings and lies are all part of the reason for Geffen's success but I still admire his ambition to get to the top. Overall a well balanced biography that, in some  cases, doesn't go into enough detail. Overall, I find Mr. Kings writing  style quite smooth and easy to read. Recommeded.	2000-04-25

It grabs you from the first page and keeps you reading. The characters Nora Clay and Conrad Voort seem to come right off the pages. A well written  novel. The only flaw was the strong anti-abortion stance the author  obviously tries to convey. Recommended.....	2000-04-20

This fast paced novel grabs you by the greens and straps you to the gurney. A well researched story line combined with realistic  characters makes for a very enjoyable read. I particularly liked Alex's odd  snacking habit...Highly recommended	2000-04-16

The story-if you can get through it-is quite good. The fact that this author uses no quotation marks makes for a slower read. It slows the  reading down immensely when you have to stop and figure out 'is this  narrative or a character talking?' This seems to me to be lazy writing as  opposed to artistic writing. I do not recommend this book for that simple  reason. I do, however, recommend that you read an excerpt before you  seriously consider purchasing this book. In my opinion there is way too  much dialogue in this book to be written in this manner	2000-04-08

The story takes place in New York City and the protagonists take on impossible odds. The action is nonstop. Like the  movies mentioned above, the believability of the plot is not something you  should dwell on, though it makes for a great read. There was one character  in the book that kept annoying me...&quot;Jose wants to know&quot;. You'll  figure it out when you read it. Recommend this as a Quick Summer read...	2000-04-07

This ride slows down towards the middle of the book. The suspense is not here. The suspense that could have been, isn't. The actual murder  happened before it could even begin to get suspenseful. The relationship  between Bryce and Wayne struck me as really odd and the agreement seemed  all to casual to seem real. This was a quick, interesting read, but nothing  I'd go out of the way to recommend..	2000-04-04

The writing style is such that it just doesn't grab you and not let you go. It is well researched and brings back some history  that I've forgotten involving General Patton and his ideals and opinions.  The action-when it occurs-seems abrubt. The details could have been more  interspersed with the action to create a more fluid and suspenseful read.	2000-03-31

In my opinion this is one of the best novels I've read in the last 2 years and I am an avid reader. It does get graphic at times but so does life. The  squeemish will shudder. If you want a truly exciting read this year, I  highly recommend 'A Slow Burning'.	2000-03-22

BUT, as usual, when it comes to air traffic control, it needed more research. When an aircraft loses its radio its called a NORDO aircraft. Meaning it  has no rdo(the abbreviation for radio in atc). The whole accident procedure  when the aircraft landed was also erred. Research is what this novel lacks  and that is why people in the field of aviation and air traffic should read  this with a grain of salt.	2000-02-26
