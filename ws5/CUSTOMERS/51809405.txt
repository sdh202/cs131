The story was compelling then as a surrogate battle of the Cold War.  Now, however, it fascinates because of the incredible and tragic story of the American champion who was made famous by and ultimately consumed by the game of chess.<br />The authors do a great job of telling the story, giving just enough history of the game of chess and biography of the participants to set the stage.  A particularly surprising revelation is what a sympathetic character Soviet champion Boris Spassky actualy was.  A poltical maveric (at least by contemporary standards) Spassky comes off as a decent guy, especially when compared to the notoriously unstable and anti-Semitic Fisher.<br />The book climaxes with aa compelling description of the match itself, which would have been memorable even without the geopolitical implications.  The authors wind down by revealing what became of the principle players in the drama, including the sad and notoriouslt paranoid state into which Fisher has descended.<br />Overall, this is a fascinating book that will delight the chess enthusiest as well as anyone else who likes a great story.	2004-03-29

Author David Liss paints a vivid portrait of early 18th century London as seen through the eyes of his protagonist, Jewish &quot;theif-taker&quot; Benjamin Weaver.  Weaver is actually a forerunner to the modern private eye, and is as quick with his wits as he is with his tounge.<br />As the book opens, Weaver is hired to investigate the apparently accidental death of his own estranged father.  He delves, reluctantly at first, into a world of double-dealing and high finance, in which paper &quot;currency&quot; is fast replacing barter and gold as the principle means of exchange.  Liss is a master at creating the proper atmosphere, and he painstakingly includes the necessary detail to give his story authenticty.  The end result is a book that is satisfying both as a mystery and a work of history.	2004-03-10

Dolnick is a gifted writer with a great flair for enticing details.  Unfortunately, he continually gets sidetracked with stories having little or nothing to do with expedition, and often goes, if you'll pardon the pun, overboard with his cutesy metaphors.  The end result is an informative book that is almost as exhausting to read as the expedition itself was to endure.<br />The tale of the Powell expedition hardly needs embellishing.  He set out with nine men down the Green and Colorado rivers through what at the time was virtually unknown territory in wooden boats battling some of the most forbidding whitewater in the world.  That his party survied at all is remarkable.  That they did so without any deaths or serious injury (at least from accident or mishap), is astounding.<br />Dolnick's problem as a narrator presents itself early on when he detours from the trip for two full chapters describing Powell's losing his arm at the Battle of Shiloh.  Certainly, the injury is an important part of Powell's story, but a complete retelling of the history of battle itself is unnecessary.  As the book progresses, Dolnick gets distracted with other Grand Canyon anecdotes, and often spends time describing in the second person what it is like to go rafting in the area today.  One or two such descriptions would have sufficed, but the author keeps going back to them again and again.<br />Overall, &quot;Down the Great Unknown&quot; covers a fascinating subject, but is a widely uneven reading experience.	2004-03-05

Nowhere can the reader find such great collections of stories and articles in the fields of Sports, Travel, Crime, Mysteries, Short Stories, and so on.  &quot;Best American Magazine Writing 2003&quot; was my first experience with this particular catagory, and I immediately noted that it contains entries from both the 2003 Sports and Crime volumes.<br />Fantastic prose and exemplary storytelling are key features to the Best American books, and this one is no exception.  The highlights from this collection include a discussion of Icebergs and Global Warming called &quot;Terminal Ice,&quot; a retelling of football coach George O'Leary's downfall called &quot;Lying in Wait,&quot; a chilling account of Holocaust victims used to create an anatmy guide in &quot;The Most Dangerous Beauty,&quot; and reportage on the Hezbollah terrorist movement called &quot;In the Party of God.&quot;<br />The only drawback to this collection is that the articles and stories vary so widely in subject matter that some will likely be of much more interest to any individual reader than others.  Nevertheless, it's a keeper.	2004-02-12

It is NOT an overall history of the storm, as it doesn't cover what it wrought upon the Gulf Coast after hitting Florida.  It is also NOT a compelling narrative history, like the book &quot;Issac's Strom&quot; about the 1900 Galveston Hurricane.  It is, however, fairly brief at less than 150 pages of narrative and contains only a few black &amp; white photographs.<br />Given the above, I would recommend this book primarily for South Florida victims of the storm as well as to anyone doing research about hurricanes.  General readers will not find much of interest here.	2004-02-11

The first caveat I would give to anyone thinking of making a purchase is that two of these essays (by David McCullough and James McPherson) are repeats from the first volume in the series.  I would secondly note that the quality of the essays included here vary wildy.<br />Some, like the speculation on John Tyler's ascendency from Vice-President to President upon the death of William Henry Harrison, and the possible outcome of a third U.S. war with Britain (circa 1896) are quite informative.  At least one, a telling of the Cuban Missle Crisis as if it precipated World War III, is quite chilling.  Others, however, are less engaging.  Anthony Beevor's recounting of Eisenhower's decision at the end of World War II not to march on Berlin, for example, adds little to the controversy that wasn't already there.<br />Overall, a worthwhile collection for those who love counterfactual historical speculation, with the above reservations.	2004-02-09

And while it is true that without Hitler there would have been no Nazi movement, it is equally true that Hitler as a leader could only have flourished in the hothouse political environment that was post-World War I Germany.  Historian Richard Evans?s ?The Coming of the Third Reich,? the first in a trilogy about the Nazis that takes the movement up to Hitler?s 1933 ascension to power, concentrates on those qualities of the German nation that made it susceptible to his virulent brand of fanatical nationalism and racism.  This is an important historical work that will soon take its place alongside the best books ever written about the subject.<br />Evans is a meticulous researcher, but even more importantly he is a good storyteller whose easy prose brings the subject matter to life for the reader.  He begins his story in the days of the legendary Otto von Bismark, the so-called ?Iron Chancellor,? who once and for all united the German nation in 1870.  Evans shows how the latent intellectual seeds of ferocious nationalism, militarism and subdued but prevalent anti-Semitism that would later spring to life so forcefully were sown into the body politic of Germany, waiting for the catastrophic defeat of the First World War to help bring them into full flower.  This worthwhile examination of previous German history is often overlooked, or gets only perfunctory treatment, in other books about the Nazis.  Indeed, Hitler himself is not mentioned by name here until after almost 160 pages of text.<br />Evans goes on to describe early Nazi history, dramatically illustrating how Hitler and his henchmen tapped into the currents of discontent flowing just under the surface of 1920s Weimar democracy, particularly among military veterans.  He graphically depicts the street violence that was so much a part of the fledging democracy, as thugs beholden to the Nazis, the Communists and even democratic parties like the Social Democrats engaged constantly in pitched battles the ultimately undermined the republic.  Even in this environment, however, the Nazi movement needed the drastic economic upheavals of the 1930s before they could turn from a fringe party to a mass movement.  The final tragedy of the book comes in late January 1933 when Hitler, whose party had peaked short of 40% of the popular vote and was actually declining, is invited to become chancellor by some contemptible and hopelessly misguided conservative politicians who thought they could control him.<br />Overall, ?The Coming of the Third Reich? is an outstanding historical work that is aimed at general readers, but should appeal to anyone with an interest in this important subject.even democratic parties like the Social Democrats engaged constantly in pitched battles the ultimately undermined the republic.

Especially if you like your humor with a little edge to it.  &quot;Neither Here Nor There,&quot; was one of his travelogs that preceeded his massively sucessful &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; (and is now a dozen years old).  Yet it is not remotley dated.<br />The book is basically Bryson doing what he does best, bumming around a particular countryside (this time all over continental Euroope) and commenting upon everything he sees, hears, smells, tastes and touches.  He does not particularly seek out resort spots, nor would the typical tourist want to imitate his arduous treks (many of which involve endless walking).  But that's what makes his work so charming.  He travels the way most of us live, and his sense of humor is unsurpassed.<br />Overall, another winning travel book from one of the most offbeat popular writers working today.	2004-02-04

We will do all the damage we can.\\" - Lieutenant Commander Robert W. Copeland, from the dust jacket.<br />One of the saddest truths about the turn of the new Millennium is the realization that the veterans of the so-called \\"Greatest Generation,\\" those who defeated Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, are now rapidly passing into history. As such, it has become even more important that the stories of their heroism and sacrifice be written down for posterity while the heroes themselves are still around to tell them. With his new book, \\"The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors,\\" literary agent and author James D. Hornfischer has documented one such lesser-remembered World War Two tale with a reverence befitting the brave men who fought and died for America's freedom.<br />The events of the book take place during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which stands as the largest naval engagement in world history, and was fought between the Japanese and American navies in the vicinity of the Philippines as General Douglas McArthur's forces were invading to take the archipelago back from the Japanese. The Leyte Gulf campaign has been well documented in other books about the Pacific war, so Hornfischer focuses most of his attention on one particular engagement off Samar Island. There, a small task force of American escort carriers and destroyers (the \\"Tin Cans\\" of the title), held off a far superior enemy fleet of battleships and cruisers with a combination of near-suicidal bravery and spectacular seamanship coupled with a healthy dose of sheer good fortune.<br />\\"Tin Can Sailors\\" is exhaustively researched, which gives the narrative the kind detailed nuance that elevates it above the level of mere reportage into inspired storytelling. Hornfischer sets the stage by introducing the main players, both the ships and the men who sailed on them. He gives an overall view of events leading up to the battle to assist the casual reader in placing it in context, and also presents enough of the Japanese point of view to give an appreciation of how desperate the forces of the Rising Sun were at this stage of the war. Desperate enough, in fact, to risk virtually their entire remaining surface fleet on a gamble, the success of which hinged on their ability to bluff hard-charging American Admiral William F. \\"Bull\\" Halsey. If not for the almost superhuman courage of the Tin Can Sailors, they might well have succeeded and seriously imperiled McArthur's invasion forces.<br />The battle scenes in the book are particularly well depicted; some of the first hand accounts are every bit as graphically disturbing as, say, the first half-hour of the movie \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" Such images are absolutely vital to the telling of the story, and the author handles them deftly, never lapsing into sensationalism. Hour-by-hour position maps showing the locations of the ships are helpfully provided to assist the reader along with a generous selection of photographs. The extras make \\"Tin Can Sailors\\" one of the best battle books I've read in terms of helping the reader see the action as it is taking place. The epilogue contains a list of those who died fighting the battle, and what's immediately striking is that America lost more fighting men in just over three hours in this one small corner of World War Two than it has during the entire nine-plus months of the Iraq war.<br />Overall, \\"The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors\\" is a first rate work of history that will be enjoyed equally by both military buffs and more casual readers.

The United States' Darien Expedition of 1854, led by earnest Naval Lieutenant Issac Strain fell squarely into the last category.  Misled by erroneous maps drawn by previous charlatan explorers, the Darien Expedition set off across the Panamanian ismuth in seach of a viable ship canal route and became hopelessly lost.  Six men of the party starved to death, and most of the rest would have followed suit but for a heoric rescue effort led by Strain himself.<br />&quot;The Darkest Jungle&quot; is a well written book that tells the story of the Strain party with a minimum of hyperbole.  Particularly gruesome are Balf's depictions of the ravaging effects that starvation and parasites had on the members of the party.  As an added bonus, in the last chapter Balf briefly describes his own travels in the expedition's footsteps.<br />The story of the Darien party isn't an epic, like that of the Scott party in Anarctica for example, but it still makes for enjoyable reading for anybody who likes real-life adventure tales.	2004-01-15

The eternal cycle of birth, suffering, death and rebirth.\\" - American Heritage Dictionary<br />  Author John Hamilton Lewis has lived and worked in the Middle East and Far East for over fifteen years; experiences he puts to good use in his new novel, _Samsara_.  Though the story opens in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp late in the Second World War, most of the action takes place in postwar Hong Kong, a city Lewis shows by his writing that he knows intimately.  Situated precariously on the edge of a newly-Communist China, Hong Kong in 1950 was just emerging as an economic powerhouse.  As such, it is the perfect backdrop for a tale of suspense and intrigue.<br />  The book opens with Royal Air Force pilot Nick Ridley locked in a fierce battle of nerves with the POW camp's commandant, the sadistic Tetsuro Matashima.  Try as he does, Matashima is unable to break Ridley's indomitable spirit despite his use of physical and mental torture.  Increasingly distraught as the defeat of the Japanese Empire becomes more and more inevitable, Matashima challenges Ridley to a sword duel.  Ridley is badly wounded in the engagement before rallying to chop off the commandant's leg.  Sent to a Philippine hospital for recuperation after the war, Ridley does not learn of his tormentor's fate.<br />  Flashing forward five years, former POW Ridley has become the successful head of Cathay Airlines, which is about to win recognition from the British colonial government as Hong Kong's official airline.  Despite his success, however, all is not well in Nick Ridley's world.  The woman he left behind before the war mysteriously disappeared just before his release from the POW camp.  Worse yet, his old enemy from before the war, Thomas Gradek, has become the colony's most powerful businessman and is determined to prevent Cathay from winning the airline concession.  When a vicious heroin-fueled gang war breaks out, Ridley is asked by the colonial government to help with the investigation, much to his eventual regret.  He finds himself drawn deeper into the intrigue; unaware that he has also become the target of Matashima as the crippled former commandant plots his revenge.  When an old face from his past suddenly reappears in Ridley's life, it sets in motion a violent series of events.<br />  Lewis is also very knowledgeable about history, using real events to spice up his narrative.  The story is as richly textured as Hong Kong itself, and is peppered with colorful minor characters with names like Formidable Fung, Charlie Sing Sing and Terrible Wu.  Lewis weaves in numerous subplots, bringing them all together in an explosive climax.  At 244 pages, the book is fast-paced and lively.

When your character has been thoroughly dissected, you go on to the next stage.\\" - from the first chapter<br />  Author Don Goldman's \\"After Life Life\\" is not an easy book to categorize.  It starts out in somewhat the same manner as the thought provoking Albert Brooks movie, \\"Defending Your Life.\\"  Like the movie, the book's main character wakes up in a strange place, only to eventually realize that he's dead but not in heaven.  Instead, he's been transported to an otherworldly weigh station in which his entire life will be evaluated to determine if he's ready to ascend to the next level.  The similarity ends there, for despite having some of the same lighthearted humor as the Brooks movie, Goldman's book weaves in elements of science fiction and suspense thriller, along with a good old-fashioned whodunit? murder mystery.<br />  Texas Supreme Court justice Andrew Law is the man who wakes up in the After Life Life to find himself being interviewed and oriented to his new surroundings by his wife's best friend, Carol.  He soon discovers that a relatively minor judicial decision he made right before his death triggered a chain of events that eventually led to a world wide economic collapse and a nuclear war.  As if that wasn't bad enough, he also learns that a seemingly innocuous lie he told his wife on their last night together ruined the rest of her life and is now preventing him from moving on to the next level.<br />  During interview process Andrew becomes convinced that he was murdered and that his death was somehow related to the fateful court ruling.  When an attempt is made on his after life life, Andrew finds that he must convince the After Life Life authorities that his killer is on the loose in their world.  Meanwhile, he must also contend with Carol's romantic feelings for him and his wife's unwillingness to forgive him for lying to her.<br />  \\"After Life Life\\" is an intriguing and challenging book that contains quite a few surprises.  The characters are quirky and unique, particularly Andrew, who narrates the story.  Goldman wisely stays away from the religious implications of the plot, save for a few obligatory phrases that leave questions about God blissfully unanswered.  The logic of the After Life Life world that he's created is quite complex, but he manages to keep it consistent throughout.  Though the murder mystery is central to the book's plot, the science fiction element, particularly the future history of Earth after Andrew's death, is vital to the story and is discussed at great length.<br />  Overall, \\"After Life Life\\" will be most readily enjoyed by those who with a taste for quirky and offbeat mystery stories.<br />A Futures Magazine book reviewr />     \\"After Life Life\\" is an intriguing and challenging book that contains quite a few surprises.

Too many novels written about police officers and how they do what they do read like the author's only expertise comes from watching reruns of the television show \\"Law &amp; Order.\\"  Not so with John Knoerle's excellent \\"Crystal Meth Cowboys,\\" a gritty thriller written with the kind of detail that could only come from having spent time riding around in a squad car.  It is a quirky, hard-boiled novel in the tradition of Elmore Leonard, filed with moments of graphic violence, but also warmth and humor.<br />  As the story begins, we meet rookie patrolman Wes Lyedecker during his first night working the streets of Wislow, California.  His partner, Officer Thomas Bell, is the most colorful cop on the force, a man with a sharp wit and a natural instinct for trouble.  The two men bond quickly after a routine disturbance call brings them face-to-face with a wildly deranged suspect overdosing on methamphetamine.  Alerted by this deadly confrontation to a surge in the local supply of the drug, Bell begins to suspect that a meth lab is operating in the area.  When he and the young Lyedecker investigate, they start to unravel a deadly conspiracy.<br />  Knoerle gets all of the details just right, especially the descriptions of law enforcement procedures and nomenclature.  He gives his police characters realistically colorful dialog, including an amusing bit in which the experienced Bell bewilders the neophyte Lyedecker with a barrage of unexplained acronyms.  The two protagonists are quirky and unique, especially Officer Bell, yet the story is not all about life on the job.  In the background are a romantic subplot and a mayoral election that the two officers become intimately involved in.<br />  \\"Crystal Meth Cowboys\\" is the first of what should be many successful novels for Mr. Knoerle.

Lee, whom in the early 1850s served as the Superintendent at West Point.  Cummings is carefully sparing in her use of Lee as a character, giving him just enough to do to avoid demystifying his legend.<br />  The main protagonist is a young, newly minted instructor at the academy, Second Lieutenant Garet Morgan.  Not long after Morgan's arrival, a legendary engineering professor, the detestable Captain Edgewick, is found floating in the nearby Hudson River.  When Morgan finds himself suspected of Edgewick's murder, he teams up with the other prime suspect, an aristocratic Southern cadet named Lambert Gardner.  Assisted by Gardner's intellectual sister Elizabeth, the pair probe into Edgewick's death in order to clear their names.<br />  In addition to providing plenty of rich historical details, Cummings has created a challenging murder mystery with enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing until the very end.  She possesses a keen understanding of the military mindset, which is vital when writing about the internal workings of the Army academy.  Her characters are quirky and well drawn, and in the context of the story quite believable.  Lingering in the background are the issues (slavery, the growing North-South split) that were tearing the country apart.  Above it all stands Lee, whose very presence lends the story a weight it would otherwise lack.<br /><br />  Overall, *Duty, Honor, Murder* is an excellent historical mystery that will be thoroughly enjoyed by both history buffs and anyone who likes amateur sleuth tales.<br />A Futures Magazine book reviewcountry apart.

The 2003 edition might just be the strongest yet.  Guest editor Buzz Bissinger has put together a strong collection of stories that probe beyond the headlines to focus on the place of sports in our society.  The book starts out with the awful tale of a former triathlete turned quadroplegic (&quot;Lucky Jim&quot;) and rarely loses intesity from there.  Other highlights include a profile of the man behind The Chicken (&quot;Fowled Away&quot;), the Washington comeback of Michael Jordan (&quot;Gambling Man), a profile of demolition derby racers (&quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;), a recount of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre (&quot;When the Terror Began&quot;), and a sad biographical story (&quot;Bobby Fisher's Pathetic Endgame).  All told, there is not a clunker in the mix.<br />Overall, this is a great collection for anyone who loves sports or who simply loves a good story.	2003-11-23

Set in that relatively short period of time between the September 11th terrorist attacks and the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, its timeline has already been overtaken by events.  Secondly, the basic premise of the novel is that the Pentagon deliberately poisoned veterans of the first Gulf War in 1990-91, not a topic likely to win the author any dinner invitations from Secretary Rumsfeld and company.  The premise is lent credence by a brief forward written by the daughter of a deceased weapons scientist at the U.S. military's Aberdeen Proving Grounds who claims that her father's death was directly attributable to his work.<br />  As for the novel itself, *Degree of Risk* contains a plot worthy of the television show *The X-Files.*  Hot shot young attorney Leesa Lambert, daughter of a United States Senator, and her best friend, former Special Forces operative Garth Porter, battle an evil Pentagon conspiracy to cover up the real cause of Gulf War syndrome.  According to the story, injections given to most of the veterans who fought in Iraq the first time were a failed attempt by the military brass to inoculate the troops from the radioactive effects of new and deadly American weapons made with depleted uranium.  The conspiracy is headed by the Secretary of Defense himself, who hires another former Special Forces operative to assassinate all potential witnesses.<br />  As America prepares to invade Iraq again, Lambert files a multi-billion lawsuit against the Pentagon, creating a media frenzy and alienating her from both her father and her politically minded fianc&eacute;.  The story then splits time between the courtroom battles and the assassin's attempts to keep the cover up intact.  Author Wilson is a very good writer who knows how to effectively build suspense.  Whether or not you buy into the basis for his story, you'll find yourself inevitably pulled along by it.  Befitting any good suspense novel, the climax is explosive and very satisfying.<br />  Overall, an exciting and politically charged thriller that is certain to raise a few eyebrows.<br />A Futures Magazine book review.assassin's attempts to keep the cover up intact.

Those with American Flag stickers pasted on their cars who have been blindly following our current President and accepting whatever he says at face value would be rudely awakened from their patriotic slumber, if they could stir themselves to read this book.  Using a large selection of his New York Times Op-Ed columns, Krugman fires salvo after salvo at the radical Republicans who are running the nation.<br />What makes Krugman's critique all the more powerful is that he clearly and rationally backs up his arguments.  This is not a half-baked, knee-jerk liberal reaction to conservatism, but rather a painstakingly well thought out broadside at the callousness, hypocrasy and deceptions that permeate the corridors of power these days.  The superficial patriots will not read this book, but every other American who cares about their country should before they enter the voting booth in 2004.	2003-10-17

In &quot;Black Earth,&quot; Meier follows the tradition of the best travel writers, journeying beyond Moscow for a first hand account of the country itself.  His travels take him to Chechnya, Norilsk, Sakahlin Island and St. Petersburg.  In each place he documents what he sees and what has gone wrong as Russia attempts to awake from its Soviet nightmare.<br />&quot;Black Earth&quot; is, perhaps, best thought of as a follow up to writer David Remnick's twin classics &quot;Lennin's Tomb&quot; and Resurrection,&quot; which covered Russian life in the first half of the 1990s.  Meier paints with broad rhetorical strokes, weaving in elements of history, literature and statistics with his observations.  Though a bit long winded at times, &quot;Black Earth&quot; is vital reading for anyone interested in modern Russia.	2003-10-15

Jake Halpern's &quot;Braving Home&quot; is a delightful little travel book that explores the question of why some people cling tenaciously to homes in some of the worst spots in the country.  Halpern's journeys take him to a North Carolina flood plain, an active volcano in Hawaii, the Malibu country, a barrier island in Lousiana and an isolated outpost in Alaska.  Along the way, he meets and befriends some very unusual, but very down to earth people.  Halpern's likability is the key to the book's success.  It allowed him to get his subjects to open up to his questions and gives the book a good natured tone.  In the end, he tries to find some common ground that they all share, but it is the journey itself that makes the book worthwhile.<br />Overall, a quirky and amusing book that will be best enjoyed by armchair travelers.	2003-10-15

The three individual topics (the criminalization of marijuana, the exploitation of migrant farmworkers and the rise of pornography as a major industry), however, are quite interesting.<br />What's obvious is that Schlosser has reported on these subjects before and has merely updated them to be put into book form.  The incidents he describes for the most part took place back in the 1990s, which makes them less than immediately topical.  Nevertheless, like with &quot;Fast Food Nation,&quot; the author has some strong views and isn't shy about sharing them.  Schlosser is a refreshing breath of fresh air as a journalist in that he refuses to buy into the conventional wisdom and asks the kind of questions that rarely get asked in other forums.<br />Overall, &quot;Refer Madness&quot; is a good stopgap for people who enjoy Schlosser's style.  It made me look forward to his next project, which will explore the American prison system.	2003-09-26

Kodikian claimed that Coughlin asked him to kill him as the two lay dying from dehydration, but he ultimately pled guilty to murder.  While the book is a mildly interesting foray into the true crime genre, it doesn't really provide much more information or understanding about this notorious incident than the article it was based upon.<br />The book lacks endnotes or a list of sources, which caused me to wonder how much of it is fact and how much is purely speculation.  Kersten provides a first hand account of the pair's misfortune in the desert, but since he apparently never interviewed Kodikian, the account itself is suspect.  Additionally, though the book runs to a mere 230 pages of text, it is quite obvioulsy padded with irrelevant historical anecdotes and a verbatim transcript of the murderer's sentencing hearing.<br />All of this wouldn't really be important, however, if the story iteself were compelling beyond the circumstances of the crime.  Prior to the tragedy, neither Kodikian nor Coughlin led anything other than mundane lives, and their blunder into the desert, rather than being some epic struggle, was really pretty pathetic.  Coughlin died only a few miles from where the two had parked their car, with a National Park visitor center clearly visible from a nearby hilltop.  Whether Kodikian acted malicously or whether he and Coughlin were merely stupendously incompotent, their grim story is ultimately just not that interesting.  Also, I caught at least one major factual error as Kersten states that Calvin Coolidge was President in 1930, when he in fact left office in March 1929.<br />Overall, a readable but not memorable true crime book.	2003-08-11

And now, as Cianci is still settling into his cell at the federal detention center at Ft. Dix, New Jersey, having been convicted of corruption, author Mike Stanton has written a long and sordid account of Cianci's life and career.  The Cianci story is so compelling that is could sell itself.  How does a man go from being an ambitious young prosecutor trying to lock up mob figures to putting wiseguys on the payroll during his tenure as Mayor?  That's the question Stanton tries to answer, and would have done so more effectively had he not become so distracted along the way.<br />As Stanton demonstrates, Cianci is a tragic figure; a man with unique political skills and leadership ability whose dark side ultimately ruined him.  Cianci was a charming rougue who knew how to manipulate his supporters and foil his enemies in the same manner as another disgraced big city Mayor: Marion Barry.  Ultimately Buddy Cianci was all about Buddy Cianci, and that was what finally did him in.<br />Stanton obviously loves politics as much as Cianci did.  His book is loaded with anecdotes and stories of the Providence and Rhode Island political landscape.  Far too many, in fact, for quite a number are either superflous or merely rumor.  Stanton repeats rumors that Cianci was hooked on cociane, for example, but never provides any proof.  The book runs to nearly 400 pages of narrative, but could have easily been chopped down by about a third.  Accounts of Cianci's appearances on the Imus in the Morning radio show, for example, are worth mentioning once, but not four or five times.<br />Overall, &quot;The Prince of Providence&quot; is a fascinating but overly long retelling of the sordid saga of a fallen politician.	2003-08-11

The primary focus of the narrative is the German U-Boat service and its charasmatic leader, Admiral Karl Donitz, as well as the British military experts who eventually devised the strategy that would defeat the submarine offensive.  The stakes were very high.  As the author states, thousands of merchant ships and tens of thousands of sailors were lost during the struggle.  At several points, Winston Churchill privately despaired that the U-Boat menace would succeed in cutting off Britain's vital supply lines and bringing the country to defeat.<br />All of this is told primarily through the first hand accounts of those who lived through the battles.  Particularly harrowing are the descriptions of death and survival by those who were aboard the sunken vessles.  The book is well balanced, providing equal time to the men who served on both sides.  Donitz emerges as the central character: a principled and dedicated fighter who ultimately allowed himself to be corrupted by Adolf Hiter's cult of personality.  Augmented by a generous illustrations section and just shy of 300 pages of narrative, the book doesn't get too bogged down in minute detail.<br />Overall, an outstanding work of military history that should appeal both to history buffs and to general readers.	2003-08-09

That said, the books work better when resurrecting the memory of nearly forgotten minor presidents such as Rutheford B. Hayes than they do documenting the accomplishments of major historical figures like Woodrow Wilson.  Simply put, Wilson's life was just too full to be given real justice by a 40,000 or so word manuscript.<br />Limited by the format, Texas A&amp;M Professor of History H.W. Brands gamely gives it his best shot.  The author of such first rate works as &quot;TR - The Last Romantic&quot; and &quot;The Age of Gold&quot; recounts Wilson's life, devoting most of the mere 139 pages of narrative to his presidency.  It's a good overview, and one that will likely whet the appetite of many readers to know more.  Wilson was a strong, controversial and enigmatic leader.  A progressive and idealist on the international front, for example, he was still very much a son of the South who strongly supported segregation at home.  Brands deals with such events as World War One, the failed battle for ratification of the Versailles peace treaty and Wilson's debilitating 1919 stroke, but doesn't delve much into the details.<br />Overall, a good if all-too-brief overview of Woodrow Wilson's life.	2003-08-07

Burke's return is more than wlecome, for it pumps new life into a series that was growing somewhat stale heading into its 15th volume.  Though bringing Burke home causes &quot;Only Child&quot; to start a little slow, it picks up the pace after about pasge 25, and is ultimately one of the better entries in the series.<br />This time out, Burke is hired by a closeted homosexual gangster to investigate the murder of his teenage daughter.  Burke enlists his usual crew: The Mole, The Prof, Michelle, Mama, Max the Silent, etc., to help him track the killer.  The investigation eventually leads to a video ring that is taping violent &quot;reality&quot; encounters featuring local teenagers.<br />Once again, Vachss has managed to mine the depths of human depravity to lend additional weight to his story.  Crime novels simply don't get much grittier than this.  Though some of his dialog still tends to be a bit over the top (the worst offenders this time out are the two lesbian porno queens), no other mystery writer working today writes with such cuttingly sharp prose or with a better feel for the streets.<br />Overall, &quot;Only Child&quot; is a winning entry in a veteran mystery/crime series.	2003-08-06

This is surprising, given that the book is being marketed as a companion piece to an upcoming PBS special about Greece's legendary warriors.  Though the book is relatively brief at around 300 pages, it is so packed full of dates, names, places and events as to become bewildering to anyone who is not already intimately familiar with the subject matter.  I'm a history buff myself, but I had a hard time following the narrative.  The author writes as if he's addressing graduate level history students with a speciality in the subject.<br />Overall, &quot;The Spartans&quot; is very well researched, but will be of little interest to general readers.	2003-07-30

And while I found the subject matter of \\"The First Heroes\\" to be quite compelling, the writing is so leaden that the book is virtually unreadable.  I also have to quibble with the title since the heroic and doomed stand at Wake Island occurred months before the Doolittle raid was just as important as an early psychological victory in the American war against Japan.  The most pertinent comment that I can make about \\"The First Heores\\" is that I became so bogged down by its lack of narrative force that, despite being an avid reader, I couldn't finish it.	2003-07-30

Greene's use of generalizations to describe what certain individuals were thinking as well as her occasionally overdramatic literary prose mar what is otherwise a very compelling real life story.<br />The disaster itself hardly needs embellishment. Nineteen coal miners were trapped for days a mile underground when a large section of the Springhill mine in Nova Scotia collapsed in 1958. As the town above fretted and began to give up hope, the men lay entombed, slowly dying. This story is similar to one published last year by Karen Tintori in a book called \\"Trapped\\" about the 1909 Cherry Mine fire in Illinois. Tintori's book, however, relies on straight reporting and is thus far superior to this one.<br />The technique used by Greene is distracting and fails to place the disaster in proper context. The book is interesting primarily because the story is so compelling and because Greene is a very talented writer. When writing about disasters, however, the author has a duty to stay out of the way and let the victims tell their stories. By that measure, \\"Last Man Out\\" is a failure.	2003-07-27

At his best, author Loren Estleman is an elite hardboiled mystery writer.  Since its first appearance with 1980's &quot;Motor City Blue&quot; the Walker series has been rivalled only by Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder series in term of quality hardboiled private eye writing.<br />This time out, Walker is hired by a susperstar female Latin singer with a very dark and sordid past.  A onetime revolutionary in her home country, she fled to the U.S. under an assumed identity after being accused of murder.  When the person whose identity she assumed turns up missing after blackmailing her, she hires Walker to find the blackmailer before her secret becomes public.<br />The plot draws Walker into web of intrigue, pitting him against his usual assortment of gangsters, cops and other assorted heavies.  Though &quot;Poison Blonde&quot; breaks no new ground for the series, it is delivered with such fresh and inventive prose that it is a more than worthwhile read.  Fans of hardboiled mysery novels owe it to themselves to get hooked on Amos.	2003-07-27

No writer could boil down what it means to be a true fan to its very essence, as he does in &quot;True Believers,&quot; without having the years of hopes and disappointments of being a loyal follower burned into his very soul.  In the book, Queenan puts his lifetime of sports fan agony to very good use, using it as the basis for what is essentially one long rant about fans, both good and bad.  His pen is as sharp as ever, and it is delightful to see him use it on such deserving people as front-running fans and slobs who make spectacles of themselves at the stadium.<br />Mostly, however, Queenan ruminates on what it is that can make an otherwise sane, rational person (such as himself) a hopeless maniac on game day.  Though he's a Philadelphia fan (Phillies, Eagles, 76ers, Flyers) he speaks enough universal truth that his book can be enjoyed by anyone who is also hopelessly hooked on sports.	2003-07-27

By telling the story of the incredible survival of Ludger Sylbaris and his subsequent career as a sideshow oddity in the Barnum &amp; Bailey circus, Morgan warmly humanizes what otherwie would have just been another run-of-the-mill disaster story.<br />Morgan carefully reconstructs the events leading up to the destruction of Saint-Pierre, describing the city and the colorful personalities in what was then a French colonial town.  Called the &quot;Paris of the Caribbean,&quot; it was caught totally unprepared when Pelee began erupting a few months before the final disaster.  The residents convinced themselves that they were far enough away to be safe before the mountain exploded in much the same manner as Mount St. Helens, utterly erasing the city from the map.<br />In the aftermath, resucuers picking over the rubble made a startling discovery.  Ludger Sylbaris somehow managed to survive the disaster in a solitary confinement cell in the local jail.  Though horribly burned, he became an instant celebrity.  When Barnum &amp; Bailey made him a part of the so-called &quot;Greatest Show on Earth,&quot; he became the first black man ever to grace the stage of the segregated show.<br />Morgan is an excellent histroian and a good storyteller, and the book contains numerous photographs and illustrations to help the reader.  At just over 230 pages of narrative, this is a highly readable and very enjoyable work.	2003-07-27

Lafferty's older brother Ron convinced him to commit the crime by claiming that God had spoken to him and instructed that it should be that way.  Both men were born and raised Mormons, but turned to radical Mormon fundamentalism as adults.  Through their horrific story and the history of the Mormon church in genral, author Jon Krakauer examines the larger issue of how relgion leads some people to commit unspeakable acts.<br />&quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; is not an anti-Mormon diatribe, as anyone who has actually read it can attest.  Krakauer, who had such a massive success with &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; should be applauded for taking a risk following up that work with a potentially controversial project well outside his area of expertise.  Part travelog and part history, &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; is a very unique true crime book as the various narrative threads are wound together by the author.  The simple yet forceful narrative style that made Krakauer's Everest such compelling reading are very much evident here.<br />Overall, &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; is an outstanding true crime book that raises some disturbing theological questions.	2003-07-16

Brands has placed himself in such heady company as David McCullough as one of the preeminent history authors working today.  Brand's biography of Benjamin Franklin is a lively, witty and very informative look at the senior statesman among America's Founding Fathers.  Helped by Franklin's engaging personailty and prolifc writings, Brands brings him to life for modern readers.<br />&quot;The First American&quot; provides a sweeping overview of Franklin's life, from his Boston upbringing to his early audulthood as a Philadelphia printer to his later years when his stature as a philosopher, scientist, politician and diplomat made him world famous.  Electricity, the Gulf Stream, the modern fire department, the lightening rod and bifocals are among the many deicoveries or inventions he either initiated or was key in developing.  And oh by the way, Franklin was also the prime negotiator of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 and played host to the Constitutional Convention in 1787.  On the whole, not a bad set of lifetime accomplishments.<br />Brands' account of Franklin's life is must reading for anyone with an interest in American History.  The author has that rare gift that combines storytelling ability with scholarship.  If more history professors could write (and lecture) this well, the subject would be all the more popular for it.	2003-07-15

Reading along as he skewers Hollywood, a pompus institution that sorely needs it, is sheer pleasure.  The book is mostly a series of essays in which Quennan takes on one aspect or another of Hollywood filmmaking and works it over with his lethal prose.  Anyone who loves Queenan's writing, or who is dedicated film buff should love &quot;Confessions of a Cineplex Heckler.&quot;<br />That said, the book is a bit dated.  Most of the individual chapters were articles Queenan wrote for &quot;Movieland&quot; magazine between ten and five years ago.  Though I had seen many of the movies he makes reference to, I occasionally had to strain my memory to recall exactly what he was talking about.  That one caveat aside, however, I give &quot;Confessions of a Cineplex Heckler&quot; an enthusiastic &quot;Thumbs Up!&quot;	2003-07-15

In the process, the defenders of Wake gave America a much-needed rallying cry as it regrouped from the initial disaster at Pearl Harbor.<br />Wukovits's outstanding military history is a fitting tribute to the military and civilian personnel who fought and died on Wake Island in the dark days immediately following the Japanese attack on Hawaii.  The author sets the stage by introducing key figures who fought there and describing the political situation that led to the Japanese first strike.  The accounts of the battle itself are particularly well rendered, mostly told through the recollections of the defenders themselves.  The accounts several Japanese soldiers are also included, helping to provide balance to the battle descriptions.<br />Equally important, Wukovits doesn't end the book with the American surrender, but instead goes on to describe the experiences of the survivors in Japanese captivity.  The description of their three-plus year ordeal of beatings, starvation and appalling living conditions are as harrowing as the accounts of the battle.  In the final chapter, Wukovits describes the fates of the survivors of the battle after the war.  In the end, the picture that emerges is of a group of reluctant heroes who did their duty when their country called.<br />Overall, \\"Pacific Alamo\\" is a compelling work of narrative military history that should appeal both to history buffs as well as to general readers.both to history buffs as well as to general readers.	2003-07-07

Garfield	Books	5	45	48	N	N	Fascinating Political History	Let me first issue this advisory: To truly enjoy Kenneth D. Ackerman's book, &quot;The Dark Horse&quot; you have to love reading about politics.  Ackerman is a Washington type, and his love of the political game and all of its intricaces is very much evident in his writing.  Fortunately, he is such a good writer that he can make even the most mundane and obscure political manuevering as compelling as any suspense thriller.<br />&quot;The Dark Horse,&quot; as the subtitle indicates, tells the tragic tale of President James A. Garfield, who was the surprise Republican nominee in 1880 and won a razor thin victory that Novemeber.  Garfield had not desired the Presidency, and was only beginning to become comfortable in the office when he was felled by an assasssin's bullet four months into his term.  He died a slow, agonizing death, and in the process became a martyred hero to the country.<br />Ackerman argues that Garflied's killing, remembered (if at all) for being perpetrated by a &quot;disappointed office seeker&quot; was a residual effect of the wars going on within the Republican Party between two competing factions: the Stalwarts and the Half Breeds.  Though the Stalwarts, led by irascible New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, were not directly complicit in Garfield's murder, their strident rhetoric helped set the political climate that made it possible.<br />Ackerman tells his story in great detail (the narrative portion of the book runs to well over 400 pages).  The is a decent illustrations section and a number of helpful charts for the reader.  Overall, this is an excellently well written book that will appeal most strongly to American History and politics buffs.	2003-06-23

Unlike many other 1950s sci-fi and horror novels, it has lost little of its impact.<br />Protagonist Robert Neville lives in his barricaded house near Los Angeles.  During the day he can move around, but at night the vampires surround his house and try to break in.  He keeps them at bay, but at a terrible cost to his mental well being.  In an effort to stave off madness, he begins to research was caused the vampire plague.  He eventually discovers the truth, which then leads to a climax that is both electrifying and haunting.<br />The novel itself is only 170 pages in length, and the length of this trade paperback edition has been doubled by the inclusion of a number of Matheson short stories.  The shorts of of varying quality, but they do not detract from what is one of the best vampire novels ever written.	2003-06-18

O'Donnell's &quot;Ship Ablaze&quot; is head-and-shoulders above the glut of historical disaster books lining the shelves these days.  O'Donnell's well written narrative history has all of the elements that make a book like this compelling: it details a tragic and nearly forgotten event, it paints the event on the proper historical backdrop and also tells the stories of the victims in a sympathetic and unsensationalistic way.<br />Though it is not well remembered, the fire and sinking of the steamboat General Slocum near New York City was the city's deadliest disaster prior to September 11, 2001.  Over 1000 people, mostly women and children, perished in a few horrifying minutes.  What is more disturbing about the story is that the disaster was completely preventable.  Had the General Slocum's fire safety equipment been properly inspected and maintained and had the crew been trainbed in fire safety, it is unlikely that there would have been any loss of life.<br />All of this O'Donnell describes in vivid detail.  He also describes life in turn-of-the-century New York, particularly the so-called Little Germany section where the victims were from.  The latter part of the book is dedicated to the legal battles that resulted in the imprisonment of the General Slocum's captain, but not the federal inspectors or boat owners who were equally responsible for the tragedy.<br />Overall, an outstanding work of narrative history that will appeal to history buffs as well as general readers.	2003-06-10
1096265:US	51809405	R1TNMSXBGVFISA	078686740X	797105738	The Frozen-Water Trade: A True Story	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Full Business Cycle	Part biography, part business history, author Gavin Weightman's &quot;The Frozen Water Trade,&quot; is an interesting and readable account of a uniquely American business that is all but forgotten today.  In this modern era of refigeration, it seems impossible to imagine the world of a century ago in which everything was cooled by harvested freshwater ice, or indeed a world of two centuries ago when NOTHING was refrigerated.  Were it not for the entreprenurial genius of a man named Fredric Tudor, Weightman's man protagonist, we all might be drinking warm drinks to this very day becuase the very idea of cold beverages might never have caught on.<br />Tudor's classic story is that of a vsionary who had difficulty convincing his contemporaries of the wisdom of his ideas, and who risked everything he had to make that vision a reality.  He eventually succeeded beyond his wildest dreams, and in the process changed the habits of first America and then of the world.  Starting in 1806, Tudor hatched upon a scheme to deliver New England ice to the tropics for sale.  He was beset by all kinds of difficulties: bureaucratic red tape, unreliable underlings, shipwrecks, disease, debtors prison, embargoes and even a war or two.  By midcentury, however, his trade in ice had become New England's leading export and had become a commodity no American could do without.<br />All of this Weightman dutifully recounts in the narrative history style that has become so popular these days.  It was appeal most to those who enjoy business success stoires.  The one drawback of the book is that Tudor as a character is relatively colorless.  He was a driven businessman who had few other interests.  Because he is forgotten today, the accounts of his personal life don't carry much interest.  Nevertheless, the story of the forgotten industry he pioneered has been well preserved by this enjoyable book.	2003-06-08

Among his many accomplishments, as the book's subtitle points out, it was Morris who wrote the final version of the American Constitution, the single greatest document of governance in world history.  For that accomplishment alone, his memory should not be allowed to fade in comparison to his contemporaries.<br />Morris's career encompassed, among much else, two terms in the Continental Congress during the height of the American Revolution.  His financial expertise was vital to keeping the war effort afloat until the victory at Yorktown secured American independence.  He also served as America's Ambassador to France during the French Revolution, keeping a meticulous account of events as they unfolded.  Much of the rest of his life was spent as a successful lawyer and financier, who occasionally enagaged in such acts of public service as championing the Erie Canal and laying out the streets of Manhattan.<br />All of this Brookhiser captures with his lively narrative prose.  The book is a relatively quick read at just over 200 pages of narrative, and Brookhiser concentrates his efforts on those periods of Morris's life that were devoted to public service.  A generous helping of illustrations are also provided.  Brookhiser also avoids being too overly fawning of his subject, pointing out those ideas of Morris's that were either dangerously flawed or just plain wrong.<br />Overall, a fascinating biography that can be enjoyed by history buffs as well as general readers.	2003-06-02
1102618:US	51809405	R1SVXP5EXUCUDS	1565123476	807905484	In the Wake of Madness: The Murderous Voyage of the Whaleship Sharon	Books	4	15	16	N	N	The Criminal Captain	Joan Druett's \\"In the Wake of Madness\\" joins the glut of recently published worksks about historical nautical disasters and mutinies that are lining the bookshelves these days.  The quality of these books varies widely, but fortunately Druett's is both well-researched and well-written.  The story of the ill-fated 1841 voyage of the whaleship Sharon is fairly grusome in its details.  The ships's captain, Howes Norris, a respected member of the Martha's Vineyard community, became increasingly mentally unhinged, turning on members of his crew with savage fury.  Things came to a head when he literally beat his cabin steward to death in front of the crew.  Not long after, Captain Norris was himself savagely murdered by several Pacific islander crew members that had been picked up as replacements for deserters from the original crew.<br />All of this Druett recounts with prose that is elegant and highly readable.  Throughout, she intertwines the story of the Sharon with that of Herman Melville, the \\"Moby Dick\\" author who had sailed on a whaling ship and was starting his writing career at around the same time.  She describes the awful conditions that the whaleship crews labored under and throws in enough historical backdrop to frame the story.<br />If the book has a drawback, its that there were no surviving firsthand accounts of Captain Morris's death.  Most of the book draws on never-published journals kept by two of the crew members.  Unfortunately, both journals have signifcant gaps in them, which Druett attempts to fill with other contemporary accounts of whaling vessles.  For the most part, she succeeds, though the book could also have used an illustrations section.  At 230 pages of narrative, it is a relatively fast read.<br />Overall, an excellent work of narrative nautical history that will appeal most strongly to those who love good sea adventure tales.	2003-06-02

Instead of cashing in on his status as the most popular travel writer in the business by merely cranking out one formulaic book a year as he easily could do, he decided to take on a monumental challenge outside of his area of expertise.  Though &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; does contain some of Bryson's standard lighthearted interviews, the bulk of his book about the world of science comes from what must have been exhausting and occasionally tedious research. The good news is that for the most part he succeeds in his attempt to make science writing palatable for the general reading public.<br />Though Bryson has always been a master at combining the humorous with the serious, this book finds him mostly treading in the latter territory.  He comes up with just enough amusing anecdotes to liven up the subject matter, but there are few laugh out loud funny moments as in Bryson classics like &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; or &quot;In a Sunburned Country.&quot;  The trick he does manage to pull is making such topics as geology, biology, astronomy, meteorology and other scientific fields (for the most part) lively and interesting.<br />With each topic, Bryson gives an overall historical overview of how the various theories and research have evolved, giving nods to famous eccentrics like Sir Issac Newton and Charles Darwin and explaining why what they accomplished is so incredible (and valuable).  He also gives numerous lesser-known scientific geniuses their proper due.  It must be said, however, that at nearly 500 pages of narrative this is not an easy read.  Some subjects even Bryson's magical pen just cannot breath much life into.  Nevertheless, it is still a fascinating journey.<br />Overall, a challenging triumph from one of the best non-fiction authors working today.	2003-05-29

Instead of a concise account of the volcanic eruption that killed over 36,000 people, Winchester's book covers the entire political history of Indonesia, from colonial times forward.  He also heaps on an overly generous amount of science, from what causes volcanic eruptions to descriptions of the botanical landscapes of Southeast Asia.<br />All of this leaves precious little room for the actual eruption, which Winchester doesn't get to until more that 200 pages into the book.  He also makes an error by not highlighting any of the many personalities who were either killed by or survived the disaster.  The most any individual person gets is a few paragrahs, so there isn't anyone for the reader to develop empathy for.  Whole villages are destroyed by tsunamis, but merit only a sentence or two.  Instead, the mundane facts and figures keep piling on like the debris from the volcano until the reader is numb.<br />All of which makes me wonder if what Winchester really wanted to do was write a history of Indonesia and merely seized upon the Krakatoa event as a highlight to cash in on the recent historical disaster publishing craze.  The subtitle of the book calls it &quot;The Day the World Exploded,&quot; which couldn't be a less accurate description of its contents.  Winchester compounds the problem by repeating himself a lot, suggesting that the book was not well edited either.<br />Overall, this is confused and meandering book that will likely disappoint many readers.	2003-05-16

Melton Jr.'s \\"A Hanging Offense\\" is a fascinating work of narrative history that resurrects an important but little-remembered incident from the early days of the U.S. Navy.  The U.S.S. Somers, one of the last sailing vessles to be commissioned by the navy, was on a routine training cruise when a near mutiny broke out, resulting in the hanging of three of her crew.  The story of the voyage is both hair raising and heartbreaking, particularly considering that two of the three hanged were very young men.<br />The would be mutineers were led by midshipman-in-training Phillip Spencer, the troubled son of a U.S. Cabinet Official who pulled the strings that got his son the post.  Spencer almost immediately began conspiring with members of the crew to kill the officers and turn the ship into a pirate vessle.  His plan was ultimately thwarted when he was double-crossed by a crewman he took into his confidence.  The tragedy caused a sensation back in the U.S., resulting in the well publicized court marshal of Captain Alexander Mackenzie.  It also exposed the many flaws endemic to the navy at the time, and ultimately resulted in much needed reforms, most particularly the establishment in 1845 of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis.<br />All of this Melton recounts with his highly readable prose.  He details the life of Phillip Spencer, who most likely suffered from a personality disorder that caused many of his actions.  Melton's accounts of the attempted mutiny itself read like the most suspenseful fiction.  The lengthy aftermath describes the legal proceedings that ultimately exonerated Mackenzie, despite the political machinations of Phillip Spencer's father.  As a professor of law, Melton also explains the finer legal points of the case in considerable detail.  The book is a lively and relatively brief at about 260 pages of narrative.<br />Overall, an excellent work of narrative history that will appeal most strongly to maritime buffs.	2003-05-14

It is structured like other &quot;Best American&quot; books, with a series editor and a yearly guest editor putting their heads together and selecting two dozen or so of the best articles to be published in the field during the previous year.  Bill Bryson was a very canny choice to be the first guest editor for the travel series, given his recent stature as one of the best selling travel writers around.<br />The best articeles in the debut 2000 edition include Tom Clynes's  account of a truck driver in the Australian Outback, a lament by David Halberstam on the yuppie-fication of Nantucket Island, P.J. O'Rourke's amusing piece about driving in India, and Mark Ross's harrowing first person account of the slaying of eco-tourists in Uganda by Interhamwe rebels.  Some of the articles are amusing, some are scary, others are full of wonder, but they are all well written and informative.

In Knopp's chosen lineup lies the first problem.  Most students of The Third Reich would certainly place Hitler's Chief of Staff Martin Boorman and SS Security Chief Reinhard Heydrich well above the ineffectual Hess or the plodding Doenitz in terms of their importance to the Nazi regime.  Ignoring those two vital figures is a serious flaw in the book.<br />The second problem is the book's configuartion.  Not witstanding the fact that a few chapters is not nearly enough space to adequately explain the lives and roles of any of these individuals, Knopp provides pages of direct quotes from and about each one, interspersed at random throughout the narrative.  He also makes the fatal mistake in such an introductory work of assuming the reader is already intimately familiar with the overall history of Nazi Germany, referring to larger events without attributing dates or in what sequence they occurred.  All of this left me wondering exactly who the intended audience was for this work?  Nazi scholars won't learn anything they didn't already know, while casual readers are likely to find themselves hopelessly confused.<br />Overall, \\"Hitler's Henchmen\\" is not a well written work of history, even allowing for the fact that it was translated from German into English.	2003-04-30

Obviously, this is a hot publishing trend.  Alas, it is also one that could stand better editing.  Ramsay gamely provides the full sweep of The Lusitania tragedy, including detailed accounts of the political intrigue that surrounded it.  Unfortunately, his prose is so, uh, lifeless, that the book is barely readable.  Ramsay's approach might be fine for historians, but readers who are looking for the kind of lively narrative history that has become so popular recently should look elsewhere.	2003-04-28

Like his contemporary, Alexander Hamilton, Jones was a vain, contentious and controversial figure of humble origins who rubbed many of those who knew him the wrong way.  He also happened to be a rare and valuable commodity in Revolutionary America in that he was a man who actually knew how to fight.<br />As Thomas dramatically illustrates, Jones was virtually the only captain among the Americans to have any success against the Royal Navy.  Jones's raids against the British home isles and his daring defeats in two diferent battles against Royal Navy battleships made him famous world wide.  Thomas's detailed accounts of the naval battles are particularly gripping.  And while Jones most likely never said the famous words, \\"I have not yet begun to fight,\\" that does not detract from his heroic refusal to surrender his ship in what was perhaps the bloodiest naval battle of the age of sail.<br />Thomas tracks Jones's entire life, from his childhood as the son of a Scottish gardner, to his time as a merchant ship captain through his Revolutionary exploits to the last, bizarre chapter in his life when he became an Admiral in the Russian fleet against the Turks.  Thomas is evenhanded in his descriptions of Jones, detailing his many faults in addition to his triumphs.  In the end, the picture that emerges is of an essentially noble individual whose insecurities made him his own worst enemy.  At just over 300 pages of narrative, the book is a relatively quick read and also has plenty of illustrations.<br />Overall, an outstanding historical biography that should be enjoyed by history buffs and even by more casual readers.	2003-04-24

Some have been very good, while others have been exploitative attempts to cash in on this particular publishing trend.  Fortunately, author Nat Brandt's \\"Chicago Death Trap\\" falls squarely into the former catagory.  Both well researched and well written, it tells the story of the deadliest fire in U.S. history.  The disaster occurred in a brand new, supposedly \\"fireproof,\\" theather, echoing the way a certain \\"unsinkable\\" ocean liner would go down a decade later.<br />Brandt appropriately tells the story in a straightforward manner.  He describes the design and construction of the theather, introduces the major players in the tragedy and then recounts the disaster in an appropriately somber tone.  Particularly gruesome is the account of the many who died after being forced to jump from the upper level of the theater, their bodies horribly filling an adjascent alleyway as helpless rescuers looked on.<br />Brandt also describes the aftermath of the fire, which saw an  increase safety laws and an attempt to hold some of the theater officials responsible.  Typically for the age, they ultimately managed to avoid formal punishment for the negligence that led to the disaster.  The book is a fairly quick read at less than 150 pages of text, and there are a number of illustrations and pictures included to help the reader.<br />Overall, a decent historical account of an unfortunately preventable tragedy.	2003-04-24

In the summer of 1919, a U.S. Army convoy left Washington, D.C., bound for San Francisco.  Two months later it arrived at its destination having fought incredible obstacles and hardships along the way.  In doing so, the convoy dramatically pointed out to a nation just emrging from the first World War and entering the automobile age the need for good roads.<br />Author Pete Davies does a decent job of resurrecting the memory of The First Transcontinental Motor Train.  He describes the trip in detail and recounts the contribution of its most colorful participants, including a young lieutenant colonel named Dwight D. Eisenhower.  The event was a spectacle all along the route, and even generated controversy between communities either included or left off the right of way.  For most of the journey, the convoy followed the &quot;Lincoln Highway,&quot; a privately funded project that was the first bicoastal road, but in 1919 in many places was actually little more than a line on the map.<br />As a work of history, &quot;American Road&quot; completes its mission well enough.  Author Davies is a decent storyteller and he does a good job of setting the historical context and showing how the event was crucial to the development of America's national road system.  The book's main drawback is that Davies chose to focus much of his attention on the relatively unintersting local political controversies along the route and not enough on the stories of individual soldiers in the convoy.  Even the colorful &quot;Ike&quot; gets only a scant few pages of coverage in total.  Also underutilized is the author's accounts of what the route looks like today, which are sprinkled in here and there without much rhyme or reason.  On the plus side, the book contains a generous helping of photographs and a helpful route map on the inside covers.<br />Overall, a decent historical work that serves to rekindle the memory of the dawn of the American motor age.map on the inside covers.<br />Overall, a decent historical work that serves to rekindle the memory of the dawn of the American motor age.	2003-04-20

Basing a novel on terrorism these days is risky.  If the plotline is too close to real events it'll be decried as cheap sensationalism, and it's no longer fashionable to devise wildly unrealistic terrorist stroylines as it was before September 11th.  Straka strikes just the right balance, combining a gritty, realistic scenerio that's just far enough away from actual events to keep it comfortable.<br />Straka's hero is a hard-boiled P.I. of the old school who nevertheless has his tender moments.  He hails from Charlottesville, Virginia (home of the University of Virginia), but this time out Straka effectively takes Pavlicek to the wilds of West Virginia to do battle with an assortment of white supremacists, lowlifes and shadowy government types.  He's joined again by his sometime sidekick and former homicide partner, Jake Toronto, whose backstory gets some examination this time out.<br />I won't give away too much of the plot other than to say the book starts out with the murder of a friend of Pavlicek and Toronto who is a fellow enthusiast for the sport of falconry.  The official police line is that the death was a hunting accident, but when Pavlicek is brutally attacked while visiting the crime scene, he immediately suspects foul play.  When he starts asking questions, other people start to die and it becomes apparent that his friend Toronto is mixed up in something very dangerous.<br />Overall, \\"Cold Quarry\\" contains plenty of action as well as colorful and sympathetic characters and firmly establishes the Frank Pavlicek series as one of the best P.I. series to come along in recent years.	2003-04-18

Let me start off by saying that I love it when I actually learn something while being entertained by a good book.  For instance, being a couple of decades short of retirment age, I had never heard of an Elderhostel before I read Peter Abresch's superb \\"Painted Lady.\\"  For those not familiar, an Elderhostel is a tour-like learning experience for folks who want to get the most out of their Golden Years.  Author Abresch is an enthusiastic Elderhostel participant, so much so that he uses his experiences as the basis for his fine James P. Dandy amateur sleuth mystery series.<br />The book starts out with a bang as Jim witnesses a woman plunge from the roof of a building during a mystery conference he's attending to be supportive of his artist girlfriend Dodee.  Suicide or murder?  That's the question that unfolds in the aftermath, and it continues to plague Dandy while he's trying to enjoy his bus trip though the West with a colorful collection of fellow Elderhostel travelers.  Things start to get really strange when the image of the woman, an American Indian, turns up mysteriously in one of Dodee's paintings.  The hardheaded Jim resists the idea that anything supernatural is going on.  Meanwhile, he and the others are being followed by a man who may or may not have some connection to the woman's death.<br />Though \\"Painted Lady\\" tends toward the cozy end of the mystery genre, there is enough sarcastic humor and suspense to satisfy those who like a little harder edge to their fiction.  Abresch is a master of little touches, such as giving minor characters memorably humorous names like Harriet Callahan and Martin Martin (not to mention Jim Dandy himself).  Though mature, his characters are plently lively with their witty banter.  As a backdrop to the story, Abresch recounts the history of the Sante Fe Trail so well that by the end you'll think you attended the Elderhostel with Jim and his companions.  It all leads to a conclusion that is both sharp and satisfying.<br />Overall, a spirited mystery novel from the kind of good natured author you'd like to sit and have a drink with.erall, a spirited mystery novel from the kind of good natured author you'd like to sit and have a drink with.	2003-04-10

Randall's highly readable account of Hamilton's life brings into sharp focus the man who was Thomas Jefferson's ideological counterpoint in the two competeing governing philosopys that emerged from the American Revolution.  Ironically, while the aristocratic Jefferson became the champion of the \\"common man,\\" it was the \\"commoner\\" Hamilton who came to favor a strong central government at the expense of individual (and state's) rights.<br />Hamilton's rise from the illegitimate son of a West Indies merchant to the very heights of power at a time when such avenues were normally reserved for nobility make him America's first great self-made man.  Most of the other founding fathers were from either the aristocrat or merchantile classes.  Hamilton, whose family's entire modest estate was confiscated at the time of his mother's death when he was a boy, was possessed of the unique ambition of an insecure man who spent his life trying to overcome his humble origins.  As Randall demonstrates, Hamilton's close relationship with George Washington, who recognized his junior's incredible organizational and intellectual gifts, was of key importance to the latter's success.<br />The text of the book is quite sympathetic its subject, perhaps overly so at times.  Though Randall does not ignore the less noble aspects of Hamilton's character, he strives whenever possible to show him in the best possible light.  Thus Aaron Burr, who actually made his own important contributions to the nation, comes off mostly as a despicable villian.  Burr will always be infamous for firing the bullet that ended Hamilton's life, but Hamilton was equally at fault for the feud that ended so tragically.<br />Oveall, Randall's book is an enjoyable and enlightening work that will most appeal to history buffs.	2003-04-09

Most people, if they've heard of the infamous 1876 Presidential election at all, recall it only when comparisons were made to the confused aftermath of the 2000 campaign.  There were many similarities in that the Democratic candidate ultimately failed to win the Presidency despite outpolling the Republican in the popular vote, and the final judgement was delayed long after the actual voting because of irregularities in Florida (among other states in 1876).  But the most glaring thing the two elections have in common is that in both cases the will of the people was ultimately thwarted by that most undemocratic of Constitutional anachornisms: The Electoral College.<br />Author Roy Morris Jr. rescues the 1876 election from the dustbin of history with his diligent research and lively prose.  He also does not hesitate to editorialize on the outcome, as the title of the book makes perfectly clear.  It's not that Morris is unfair to former Civil War General Rutherford B. Hayes, who was ultimately declared the winner in an unbeleivably convoluted series of back room dealings, quite the contrary in fact.  Morris instead lays outs the facts so that the reader can plainly see that New York Governor Samuel Tilden, despite being a less than perfect candidate, deserved a better fate.<br />The stakes were high in America's centenial year.  Reconstruction was winding down (indeed, Hayes would ultimately end it), white southeners were reasserting their political muscle in a way that would ultimately lead to Jim Crow and the disenfranchisement of the former slaves and tensions between the parties were running high enough that a resumption of Civil War hostilities seemed a distinct possibility.  The outgoing, scandal-plauged Grant administration burdoned Hayes, while Tilden was saddled with a Democratic party that had been the home of the Copperheads during the Civil War.  Like 2000, the country was nearly evenly split politically, though unlike 2000, as Morris points out, the outcome did not dramatically effect the course of American history because Morris supposes that Tilden would have made many of the same decsions that were made by Hayes as President.<br />Overall, an extremely well-written and important work that will be enjoyed be history buffs and even by more general readers.did not dramatically effect the course of American history because Morris supposes that Tilden would have made many of the same decsions that were made by Hayes as President.<br />Overall, an extremely well-written and important work that will be enjoyed be history buffs and even by more general readers.	2003-04-07

The premise alone is enough to make for compelling reading, and fortunately the stories themselves expand upon it.  The highlight of the book is Brad Linaweaver's novella \\"Moon of Ice,\\" which masterfully extends the famous diaries of Nzai propoganda chief Joseph Goebbles into the mid-1960s.  Goebbles chronicles in the first person the death of The Fuhrer and the intrigue surrounding the foundation of Burgundy, the medieval mini-state formed by Heinrich Himmler's notorious SS.  Linaweaver throws into the mix Goebbles's relationship with two of his (now adult) children, each of whom has chosen a much different path.<br />Other highlighs include Hilary Bailey's noir-ish tale of intrigue \\"The Fall of Frenchy Steiner,\\" and Howard Goldsmiths nastly little horror tale \\"Do Ye Hear the Children Weeping.\\"  There's even a good Rip Van Winkle-like tale in C.M. Kornbluth's \\"Two Dooms.\\"  Also it must be said that, title of the book not withstanding, Hitler rarely remains victorious at the end of most of these stories.<br />Overall, this a  juicy little short story collection for those who like alternative history tales.	2003-04-07

Gary Condit is the real life doppleganger for fictional Virginia Congressman Tor Drummond, a man desperately seeking re-election despite a nasty sex scandal.  When one of the Congressman's twin daughters disappears, the other hires Charlottesville Private Eye Frank Pavlicek to determine her wherabouts.  Pavilcek is, of course, dubious at the beginning, and not surprisingly ends up with far more than he bargained for as he probes into the Congressman's sleazy life.<br />Anyone who reads a lot of private eye fiction will find plenty of familiarity in Straka's book.  Pavilcek cracks wise and has a somewhat mysterious, tough-guy sidekick (his former partner from his days with the NYPD), an emotionally strong and supportive girlfriend and an eccentric hobby (he's a Falconeer).  Straka's descriptions of Charlottesville (home of the University of Virginia) are so accurate and inviting that they could have been written by the Chamber of Commerce.<br />As for the mystery, even though some of the minor elements of the book are a bit cliche (the Chief of Police is a jerk, the Feds are the clumsy heavies, the Congressmen's Chief of Staff is cast right out of the movie \\"No Way Out\\"), you can forgive it because Straka's prose and storytelling are so fresh and immediate.  For example, Pavilcek's relationship with his college age daughter, who sometimes helps him with his cases, never lapses into cheap sentimentality the way it could in a lesser writer's hands.  The build up to the climax is well done and when it comes it is explosive and ultimately satisfying climax.<br />Overall, an outstanding work of private eye fiction from a recently bygone era that I'm sure we all wish could return to.	2003-04-04

Toland doesn't content himself by merely reporting the facts, rather he makes a real effort to get inside the man's head and determine how he came to be such an explosive package of brilliance and insanity.  The story of Hitler the man is so improbable that had this been a work of fiction, no one would have found it plausible.  He was a self-man who, against all odds, seized absolute power in a Europe in which until his own adulthood, heredity usually dictated one's station in life.<br />Though daunting at over 100 pages, Toland has a good stroytelling touch, making the book quite readble.  Toland thoroughly chronicles Hitler's life, from his abused upbrining, through his service in the First World War, to his rise as a young politician, and finally his seizure of power and all the evil that followed.  The book is generously sprinkled with photographs and other illustratins to help the reader.<br />Overall, an outstanding historical biography that is as monumental as its subject.	2003-03-31

Borneman's &quot;Alaska: Saga of a Bold Land&quot; delivers exactly what it promises to deliver from its subtitle.  The book is a complete history of the 49th State, from prehistoric times until the dawn of the 21st Century.  Checking in at 540 pages of narrative, it is as big and daunting as Alaska itself.  Though the book could have used more illustrations and perhaps some photographs to assist the reader, Borneman is a good enough storyteller to keep things interesting.<br />The story begins with a discussion of the migration of native tribes from Siberia during the last ice age.  Borneman then flashes forward to Vitus Bering and the first Russian explorations and colonization of the territory.  This is then followed by &quot;Seward's Folly,&quot; the American purchase of Alaska, which, surprisingly, as Borneman demonstrates was much more widely supported than many historical accounts would indicate.  At two cents an acres, it was certainly one of the great bargains of the 19th Century.<br />Moving into the 20th Century, the story focuses on the Alaskan Gold Rushes and American settlement, the Japanese invasion during World War II, the 1964 earthquake, and finally the production of oil and the resulting envioronmental controversies.  Borneman's scope is expansive, and any reader of his book will come away with a very complete knowledge of the history of what remains the last American frontier.<br />Overall, a comprehensive and well-written account that will be particularly appreciated by history buffs.	2003-03-20

Surely, he couldn't top that, could he?  Well, with \\"The Devil in the White City,\\" Larson has produced a book at least the equal of, if not better than, his previous effort.  As a work of history, this book has it all.  It resurrects for the modern reader the memory of an all-too-forgotten historical event (the 1893 Chicago World's Fair) and combines it with the sensational and gruesome story of the firt American equivalent of Jack The Ripper.<br />The book is structured as a dual biography of Daniel Hudson Burnham, the steadfast architecht who was the prime mover in making the World's Fair an astounding succes; and of Dr. H.H. Holmes, the diabolical psychopath who operated his own killing chamber in a hotel he built not far from the fairgrounds.  The two men never met, nor did they have any connection other than their contemporary existance, but weaving their stories together was a brilliant choice by Larson.<br />Larson provies plenty of colorful backdrop for his main story, vividly describing harsh life in 19th Century Chicago; the development of the first skyscrapers, the Charles Dickens-like ambiance of the streets and the colorful personalities that made it go.  He also describes the amazing and lasting impact the Fair had upon America, the The Ferris Wheel, Cracker Jack and Shredded Wheat being but a few of the things that debuted there.  And, of course, he graphically describes the Holmes murders and the investigation that finally brought him to justice.  Larson is a diligent researcher in addition to being an excellent storyteller, and that's what makes this book so special.<br />Overall, an outstanding work of narrative history that is like to be high on most reviewer's lists of the Best Nonfiction Books of 2003.	2003-03-17

Granted, Black is taking aim at an enormous and very slow moving target, but she possesses the rhetorical equivalent of a howitzer in the way she blasts every aspect of Gray's psycho-babble to smithereens.  It is sort of like what would happen if George Carlin took on Dr. Phil in a no holds barred debate.<br />Black structures her book just like any self help tome you see on the shelves.  The chapters are short, lest she test her (daytime television watching) audience's short attention span.  There are plenty of meaningless &quot;lists&quot; and the print is nice an large so you can feel like you've accomplished something by reading lots of pages in a short amount of time.  The book is also peppered with a generous portion of amusing illustrations by Peter J. Welling.  Even if you've never read a self help book before and can't imagine ever reading one, you'll find plenty to laugh at.<br />Overall, a quick and humorous read that is a perfect and long overdue satire.	2003-03-17

After World War II, Barbie became one of the most notorious Nazi fugitives and a fixture in his adoptive home of Bolivia, where he advised the dicatatorial government on security matters.  He was finally arrested in 1983 and extradited to France.  Convicted of war crimes in 1987, he was sentenced to life in prison and died there in 1991.<br />Unfortunately, author Brendan Murphy's account, while a compelling study of human evil and crime and punishment, was published in 1983, years before Barbie was finally made to pay for his considerable crimes.  As such, it is incomplte.  Nevertheless, the book is still a compelling account of one of Nazi Germany's more notable criminal leaders.	2003-03-17

Making the disaster even more gruesome was the fact that 23 of the crew survived the initial explosion only to die a excruiating death from slow suffocation followed by flash fire.  And the worst part is that had it not been for the sad state of the Russian Navy and the country's continued suspicion of the West, the 23 survivors might have all been rescued alive.<br />Moore has done a tremendous job of getting to the facts considering the obstacles he must have faced.  He describes the bleak life of those assigned to Russia subartic, super secret naval bases and the deterioration of the Russian Navy since the cold war in vivid and unflinching terms.  He also humanizes his narrative by telling the vicitims personal stories.  Moore then shows how Russian military paranoia contributed to the disaster, first by preventing its detection for twelve crucial hours, then by refusing to acknowledge that anything unusual had occurred and lastly by initially refusing help from British and Norwegian diving experts even when it became apparent that the breakdown in their own infastructure was hampering their rescue attempts.<br />The overall picture that emerges is that of a preventable tragedy compounded by multiple human errors.  The only silver lining is that because Russia is now ostensibly a democracy, the military couldn't cover up its mistakes like it had in the past.  The families of the victims were able to pressure the Russian leadership for answers, and ultimately receive monetary compensation for their loss.  Also, for the first time, Russiaan military commanders were held accountable for loss of lives under their command.  Moore might not be quite as deft a storyteller as he could be, but his unflinching account is complete and compelling.<br />Overall, an excellent work of book length journalism.ll, an excellent work of book length journalism.	2003-03-13

The notorious Auschwitz camp doctor who personally comdemmed thousands to their deaths and performed hideous experiements on many others is an important symbol of just how depraved the Nazi regime was.  That a man of science, a man sworn to prevent human sufferning, could allow his profession to be so grotesquely perverted clearly demonstrates how fundamentaly evil Nazi ideology was.  Mengele is a real life villian for the ages, someone the likes of whom humanity will hopefully not see again.<br />Unfortunately, Astor's portrait, while compelling and informative, fails to really capture essence of the man.  Perhaps becuase the author apparently received little cooperation from Mengele's (prominent!) family, there isn't musch information about Mengele's early childhood or adulthood, nor of the period from the end of World War II to his escape from Europe in 1949.  The two periods of Megele's life where Astor's information is most complete is his time at Auschwitz from 1943-44 and the last two decades of his life, when he lived in Brazil before drowning on the beach in 1979.<br />There's almost nothing in the book about Megele's marriage, nor of his service on the Eastern front with the Waffen SS before a battlefield wound sent him to the death camp and his infamy.  Even the Auschwitz period is strangely stilted.  There are eyewitness accounts of the atrocities committed by Mengele and of his experiments, but a thorough account of what he thought he was accomplishing is strangely lacking.  It must also be said that Astor's prose is at times somewhat stilted, and he occasionally digresses into pop psychology--a dangerous thing to do in a case such as this.  Ultimately, Menegele comes off as despicable but still a mysterious figure.<br />Overall, I would give this book a qualified recommendation only because of the importance of its subject matter.	2003-03-03

In addition, over the years he has produced numerous shorter pieces for magazines, which were bound together for \\"Brave Companions.\\"<br />As a historian, McCullogh has always been very interested in the lives of people, hence the title of the book.  In his narrative he brings to life a number of historical figures, some of whom have become quite obscure.  Alexander von Humboldt, for example, was a contemporary of Lewis and Clark whose scientific expedition to South America may have been a more impressive feat than the journey of the two Americans.  \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" author Harriet Beecher Stowe and Old West painter/sculptor Frederic Remington are the subjects of short but frank mini-biographies.<br />The biographical material remains McCullogh's strong suit and represents the best parts of this collection.  A few of the other pieces don't work quite as well.  Some were written as long as 30 plus years ago and are dated today.  As with any collection of this kind, the reader is likely to focus on those articles that are of the most personal interest.  At less that 250 pages of text, the book is a relatively quick read compared to most of McCullough's works.<br />Overall, an excellent historical work that will particularly be enjoyed by fans of David McCullough.	2003-02-28

As part of her volunteer duties, she accepts a large donation from the husband of a wealthy socialite who has died.  It all seemed pretty routine, until a large portion of the collection turns up missing and it becomes apparent that the books are a sore spot in a long-running feud among the eccentric wealthy family that donated them.  As the mystery of the missing books unfolds, Margaret Anne finds herself entagled in the affairs of the family even as she and her husband are trying to enjoy a much-needed vacation at the beach.<br />&quot;An Elusive Inheritance,&quot; fittingly, is a well-written literary mystery.  Morris's love of books and book collecting shines brightly on every page.  Her description of the appreciation collectors have for fine first-edition books is absolutely dead on.  Additionally, Morris's descriptions of the Washington area are as detailed as I've read in a work of fiction.  This is not official Washington, mind you, but the sprawling metropolitan area in which several million people live and work.<br />Overall, an excellent literary mystery novel that I would highly recommend.	2003-02-27

They were chosen by the current editors of the magazine.  The subject matter is quite varied, featuring outdoor adventure tales, life among the native people, wildlife exposes and much more.  The stories are as varied as the people who inhabit the last great American wilderness.<br />The caveat I would note for anyone interested in reading the book is that most of the stories are quite short, and because they were published for a then-contemporary audience, someone not familiar with local history or geography might sometimes get lost in the narrative.  Also, &quot;Alaska&quot; started out as a sportsman's magazine, so a lot of the early stories are about hunting and trapping, which some people might not enjoy.<br />Those cautions aside, &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; is a decent read for those who likes outdoor adventure stories.	2003-02-20

Much of it is written in the present tense, rarely ever appropriate in a historical work.  Additionally, the book contains no notes or bibliography, another major warning sign in a work of history.  Given how it is constructed, one has to wonder if the author intended for his work to read like a historical novel, but it fails on that level as well.<br />It's a pity, because the subject itself is quite interesting and deserves a much better treatment.	2003-02-10

The book tells the story of the 1928 hurricane that devastated the Florida Everglades, killing perhaps as many as 3000 people when the Lake Okeechobee Dike gave away.  Author Robert Mykle sets up his story well, providing a generous helping of historical background and meterological facts.<br />Mykle spends much of the first half of the book describing everyday life in the Everglades in the early 20th Century.  He particularly focuses his attention on several families who had settled there hoping to scratch a decent living out of the \\"mucklands,\\" as drained Everglades swamps were called.  Mykle the shows how poor forecasting, inept politicians and ignorance of the landscape combined with sheer bad luck to cause a tragedy that could have been greatly diminished if the victims had been given adequate time to evacuate the lowlands.<br />Mykle is a decent storyteller, but the book does have a couple of drawbacks.  Mykle largely ignores that great devastation that the 1928 storm wrought upon numerous islands in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, giving these other disasters only a cursory mention.  He also has a tendency to repeat himself in the text and portions of the book are very poorly edited.  <br />Overall, a readable an interesting book for those who love a goodweather-related disaster tale.	2003-02-10

The fire was of great importance in the history of Great Britain's capital, as it essentialy erased medieval London from the map and allowed the modern city to be erected in its place.<br />Hansen sets the stage very effectively by describing everyday life in the city circa the 1660s.  London was just recovering from a plague epidemic when the fire struck, started innocently enoough in a bakery and whipped up by strong winds and the effects of a nearly year-long drought.  The descriptions of the fire itself are particularly harrowing and Hansen shows himself to be a master of the details.<br />The book's one drawback is that the maps that are included are not well-detailed, so that the reader often has to guess where a particular event is taking place.  Additionally, Hansen assumes a certain amount of prior knowledge about British History and Georgraphy that might be lost upon those readers not intimately familiar with London or its history.  Nevertheless, the book is still a compelling read for those who like a good disaster tale.	2003-02-10

Nobody (amature or professional) with a passion for meterology is unaware of the 1925 Tornado's impressive resume as the deadliest twister in U.S. history.  It is &quot;forgotten&quot; only in the sense that because there are no survivng photographs, it tends not to get mentioned whenever tornados are featured on weather-related television programs.<br />That said, author Wallace Akin, who was a child when the storm virtually destroted Murpheyboro, Illinois, has documented the accounts of that harrowing day for history.  Akin faithfully recalls the events as they happened, throwing in a helpful amount of weather-related science to help the less informed reader.  Akin tracks the storms progress from touchdown as it crossed parts of three states, spreading destruction and misery in its wake.<br />The book's main drawback is Akin's limited abilities as a storyteller.  The first hand accounts in the book are mostly matter-of-fact, and rarely come alive for the reader.  Combined with the fact that the book is barely 150 pages of large type narrative in length, and it feels like a pretty slight effort.  The overall impression you get as a reader is that the story would have made a better long magazine article that a full length book.	2003-02-03

For example, Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and Sebastian Junger's &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; began as stories in the magazine.  The definition of what constitutes an &quot;Outside&quot; article is very loose and there are stories here about animals, landscapes, extreme sports, exotic travels, and yes, even an ongioing Communist insurgency.  &quot;Outside&quot; is the magazine you read if you want to know what is going on in the world around you beyond the insipid sniping of politicians and celebrity-obssessed news reports.<br />&quot;Outside 25&quot; collects nearly three dozen articles into a nearly 600 page volume that never lags for a second.  Some of the &quot;giants&quot; of modern literature and journalism are here, including the aforementioned Krakauer and Junger, Peter Maas, Hampton Sides, Paul Theroux, Tim Cahill, Bob Shacochis and many others.  The one thing ever piece has in common is a refusal to in any way to limit the imagination.  The articles are almost all from the last five years, meaning that they are mostly still fresh and relevant.<br />Overall, an outstanding and well thought out collection that even couch potatoes can enjoy.	2003-01-29

It can't decide whether it wants to be a straight historical account of the creation of Mount Rushmore or a piece of modern &quot;travel&quot; writing, in which the author describes his subject as part of the backdrop for his own adventures.  Generally, the historical parts work better than the travel parts, and at over 400 pages the book is definately too long for its subject matter.<br />That said, Taliaferro is a good writer, though he occasionally makes rather glaring factual errors (like placing the year that the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke as 1997 instead of 1998).  He also dwells a too much on issues like the American Indian view of Rushmore being placed in the middle of the Sioux tribe's &quot;ancesteral homeland.&quot;  In this he comes off like a liberal who despises everything Rushmore stands for even while professing to admire it as a monument.<br />The book is at its best when describing the history of the monument itself and the biography of its creator, the volatile and controversial sculptor Gutzon Borglum.  Borglum was full of paradoxes, for example his hero was Abraham Lincoln and he was a confidant of Theodore Roosevelt, and yet he was a ardent supporter of the Ku Klux Klan.  Taliaferro spends the first 200 pages of the book describing Borglum's life and the contemporary history of America at that time before he even gets to the construction of Rushmore.  There may bee too much historical background, but it is nonetheless a compelling story.<br />Overall, an insteresting and informative book that nevertheless contains a number of flaws.	2003-01-27

With \\"Basalmic Dreams\\" he turns his sharp wit against what he sees as the many \\"crimes\\" of his own generation.  And what a ripe target for satire.  Queenan is able to skewer Boomer pomposity and hypocrisy with the kind of detail that could only come from someone who has walked among them.<br />That said, the book starts slowly.  Queenan's last book (the hilarious \\"Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon\\") saw him actually experiencing things.  \\"Balsalmic Dreams,\\" however, reads more like an essay, and it takes Quenan about half the book to really get warmed up.  By the time he comes to the Chapter entitled \\"What a Fool Believes\\" and deservedly lambastes Tom Brokaw's silly notion of \\"The Greatest Generation,\\" the book becomes laugh out loud funny.  Queenan goes on to portray an alternative version of American History told as if Boomer values had been held by historical figures.  Under this scenerio, Thomas Jefferson is impeached for having an affair with his \\"nanny\\" and Abraham Lincoln delivers a touchy-feely Gettysburg Address.<br />In the end, \\"Basalmic Dreams\\" is properly subtitled.  It is indeed short at a mere 210 pages and it reeks of self-importance (in a self-effacing way).  It is also quite funny, especially in the second half.  Hopefully, its readership will also get its message and learn to \\"mellow out.\\"	2003-01-07

The writers of the essays for the most part assume some level of knowledge about each war zone on the part of the reader, and the book is aimed more toward opinion leaders than the general public.<br />The essays themselves are an attempt by the various writers to help those of us in the West come to grips with the causes of genocide and our obligation to attempt to stop it.  The argument is made that in Yugoslavia, for example, even the most minimal military intervention could have stopped the slaughter years earlier and that the Bosnian Serb forces in particular were nothing more than paper tigers.  The \\"Powell Docterine\\" that has repeatedly led to a reluctance by the U.S. to use its military comes under particular criticism.  The authors also tailor their remarks to the post-September 11th political realities.<br />Overall, a strong collectiion of political essays aimed at opinion leaders.	2002-12-18

The polar and African expeditions were mammoth affairs that taxed those who participated in them to the limit, often killing or horribly maiming them.  By contrast, being the first person to scale an Alp, as we know today not by far the most imposing of mountains, just doesn't rate as an achievement.  Still, the book is interesting as an historical account of the beginnings of the sport of mountaineering.<br />Fleming is an excellent writer and a good stroyteller.  Parts of &quot;Killing Dragons&quot; are quite thrilling, particularly his accounts of the conquest of the Matterhorn and the first ascent of Mount Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps.  Between such events, however, the story lags.  The history of the founding of Britains Alpine Club and squabbles among its illustrious members, for example, isn't exactly the kind of stuff that takes your breath away.<br />Overall, &quot;Killing Dragons&quot; is better as a work of history than as a collection of adventure stories.	2002-12-13

The narrative of Fleming's book covers the quest to stand literally on top of the world that began in earnest in the wake of the disappearance of British explorer Sir John Franklin while searching for the fabled Northwest Passage in 1845.<br />Fleming reconts each expedition individually and chronologically, retelling the compelling horrors that befell men such as the hapless George DeLong and Charles Francis Hall.  He describes in vivid detail what it was like to exist in a climate where the temperatures sometimes reached 100 degrees below zero.  Men watched helplessly as their ships became trapped and slowly crushed by the polar ice pack and faced sledging journeys of hundred of miles with little food or shelter.<br />Fleming recounts the numerous mistakes that were made both theoretical (the persistant belief that the pole was covered by open water) and pratical (the fact that scurvey continued to haunt the explorers even after they figured out how to stop it).<br />Slowly but surely, as each expedition added to knowledge about the perils of Arctic travel and technology slowly improved, men penetrated farther north until finally Robert Edwin Peary claimed the ultimate prize in 1909.<br />Fleming is a gifted writer and storyteller and his book makes for terrific reading in front of a fireplace with a mug of hot chocolate on a cold winter night.	2002-11-21

It became apparent from the very first chapter that author Andrew Roberts is assuming that his readers already have substantial knowledge about the lives of his two protagonists.  Rather than a straightforward account of their lives like you would expect in a dual biography, the author makes comments and observations about facts he assumes the reader already knows.  I already had some general knowledge of Napoleon's career, and I still had a hard time following the narrative.<br />A second observation about the book is that the battle of Waterloo itself gets a very small percentage of the narrative.  Most of the book concerns what came both before and after Waterloo in the lives of the two generals who fought there.  Also, events in the book are not presented chronologically and Roberts jumps around while comparing the two leaders.<br />There is nothing necessarily wrong with Roberts's approach, except that the book is being marketed to the general history audience.  I would definately not recommend it to anyone not already intimately familiar with the subject matter.	2002-11-13

The world's attention (such as it is) has been focussed on the forcible removal of white farmers from their land with the  explict support of the government.  But as Meredith demonstrates, President Mugabe's racist policies toward whites is just one of many evils he has perpetrated on his country.<br />Meredith starts out by setting the historical stage, including telling about the horrific brutality of white rule in what was then Rhodesia before the 1979 \\"revolution\\" that brought Mugabe to power.  Certainly, Zimbabwe's violent release from colonialism has a lot to do with the country's current situation.<br />Meredith then goes on to show the early promise that Mugabe showed as president, so willing for reconcilliation that he met with the last white Prime Minister, Ian Smith on numerous occasions to ask adbvice in the early years.  Meredith then shows how as Mugabe became increasingly paranoid and obsessed with power his cronys became more and more corrupt.  Anyone who believes that third world debts ought to be forgiven should read this book.  Zimbabwe is in a state of financial collapse because its president and his associates bled the country dry, not because of IMF or World Bank financial imperialism.  If anything, Western aid has helped serve as an enabler for Mugabe's destruction of Zimbabwe.<br />The book's main drawback is a lack of first hand reporting by Meredith.  There is no indication in the narrative that the author has ever visited Zimbabwe and he seems to have relied mostly on second had accounts.  Nevertheless, he is an excellent researcherr, and despite this flaw this is still a compelling read for those with an interest in current events beyond the headlines.lines.	2002-11-10

In this case, he traipsed to Sierra Leonne, Chechnya and the island of Bougainville in Papau New Guinea to cover three vastly different war zones where people were dying and little attention was being paid.  With all three stories, Pelton sets the recent historical backdrop and then travels into the thick of things.<br />The Sierra Leonne piece, which kicks off the book, is by far the weakest.  The guerilla conflict there was essentially over by the time Pelton arrived and he neither witnessed any of the atrocities committed there first hand nor has much luck providing real insight other that the obvious: namely that the diamonds buried beneath the soil provided the income to keep the rebel forces going.<br />Pelton has better luck in Chechnya, where he entered Grozny shortly before the 1999 Russian offensive and barely escaped the advancing forces.  This is war reporting at its best, immediate and chilling.  This part is particularly relevant in providing understanding to the recent Russian hostage crisis.<br />The back story of the Bougainville section was the most enlightening part of the book.  I'm sure very few people outside of the south Pacific region are even aware that the large, mineral rich island has been the site of a terrible insurrection for more than a decade.  Once again, however, Pelton doesn't arrive until after the shooting stops and his attempts to interview the elusive Bougainville rebel leader Francis Ona are only interesting to a point.<br />Overall, an interesting if uneven work that will appeal most strongly to those who like real life adventure tales and those with a curiosity about the world's most dangerous places.	2002-11-07

Burnett's &quot;Dangerous Waters&quot; sounds a warning about the global rise in crimes on the high seas.  What he's talking about in his investigation is not, for the most part, large pirate vessles sailing the oceans in search of booty.  Instead, he describes (mostly) small scale acts of robbery punctuated by the occasional dramatic act of violence.  As Burnett points out, most pirarcy today occurs between Africa and the Pacific Ocean, and indeed Burnett spends most of his investigation in and around Indonesia, which has become modern pirarcy's largest hotbed.<br />Burnett had a harrowing personal experience with pirates in 1992 when he was robbed while sailing his small boat off the coast on Indonesia.  This was the genesis for his investigation, though he did not begin his travels in search of pirates until nearly ten years later.  Along the way, he talks to several victims of pirates, some law enforcement types out to stop it and also takes a journey aboard an oil tanker through pirate infested waters.<br />Burnett does a good job sounding a warning about modern piracy and the potential for a major economic or environmental disaster if, for example, an oil supertanker is hijacked for ransom or crashes while being the crew is being attacked.  On the downside, Burnett's approach is haphazard and not well organized.  He jumps from topic to topic randomly and has the annoying habit of repeating himself.  The book also lacks one central compelling event to give it added punch.<br />Overall, an informative book with a few flaws.	2002-10-17

Confidential\\" fame is the guest editor this year, which may explain why this year's model is a touch more hard-boiled that the 2001 edition.  Additionally, it should be noted that the 2002 collection also contains several boxing and baseball stories because series editor Otto Penzler put together theme anthologies for both sports in the last year.<br />That said, the stories in the 2002 collection run the gamut from literary to whodunnits? to crime stories.  How you like each one will probably depend on your tastes as a reader.  All are expertly written by the best mystery writers working in the genre today.  My personal favorites are Thomas J. Cook's boxing  story \\"The Fix,\\" Clark Howard's grim caper story \\"The Cobalt Blues,\\" and Stuart M. Kaminisky's gritty crime saga \\"Sometimes Something Goes Wrong.\\"  Some of the stories didn't work for me, particularly the literary stories, but that's mostly a matter of personal taste.<br />The short story, particularly the mystery short story, is a disappearing art form.  \\"Best American Mystery Stories 2002\\" is doing its part to keep it alive and well.	2002-10-11

Instead, the author travelled tens of thousands of miles researching the legacy of Captain James Cook, arguably the greatest of all European explorers.  Like &quot;Attic&quot; the book is part history, part travelogue and part social commentary.  Horwitz includes mnay more historical information this time out, most likely because far fewer readers are intimately familiar with Cook's voyages than the Civil War.<br />Horwitz starts his journey by sailing on a replica of Cook's first ship Endurance to get a feel for 18th Century shipboard life.  He then spends most of the remaining time traipsing around the Pacific with his Australian friend Roger, who provides the same kind of narrative counterpoint as Robert Lee Hodge did in &quot;Attic.&quot;  Horwitz documents the changes that have occurred in Oceania because of Cook's &quot;discoveries&quot; and interviews numerous islanders to find out how they feel about Cook's legacy.  The results are often surprising and enlighteneing.<br />Having said all of that, &quot;Blue Latitudes&quot; is not a classic on the order of &quot;Attic.&quot;  The narrative is a lengthy at nearly 450 pages and is sluggish at times.  Companion Roger is not nearly as interesting a character as was Hodge and the moments of uproarious humor that made &quot;Attic&quot; so entertaining are mostly missing this time out.  Nevertheless, &quot;Blue Latitudes&quot; is still a well-written and worthwhile read for those with an interest in the subject matter.	2002-10-03

Brands shows again why he is one of America's foremost historians with his compellingly readable account of the 1849 California Gold Rush and the early history of the state.  Brands digs down through the myths about the Gold Rush and unearths the fascinating stories of the people (immigrants and Americans alike) who caught America's first big burst of gold fever.  Among the key players were William T. Sherman (later the famous Civil War General), explorer John C. Fremont (later the first Presidential nominee of the Republican Party), and Leland Stanford (founder of the University that bears his last name).  They all come together at what was truly one of American history's major crossroads.<br />Brands does not limit himself to just recounting the adventures in the gold fields.  He focusses on the larger political, social and even military effects of the gold rush.  The chapters recounting the lengthy, perilous journeys by land and sea that the gold miners took to get to Califorinia are particularly compelling.  Brands also discusses at length the growth of San Francisco into a major city and the establishment of California's state government.  Additionally, he devotes time examining the U.S. congresional Compromise of 1850, which allowed California to be admitted as a state only after a bitter and acrimonious sectional feud over slavery.<br />Brands is an excellent writer with that rare ability among historians to make his historicals accounts read like fiction.  His book is well-researched and the author has a flair for capturing the essence of the historical figures involved.  He also argues strenuously that the gold rush's effects on American politics as a whole, including pushing the country toward Civil War, should not be underestimated.<br />Overall, an outstanding work of history that can be enjoyed by serious students and casual readers alike.	2002-09-17

She tells the harrowing tale of the 1909 Cherry (coal) Mine fire in central Illinois that ranks as the nation's third deadliest mine disaster.  Over 250 men died in the mine, and the death toll could have been much worse if not for the amazing heroism of some of the rescuers (eight of whom died in circumstances eerily reminiscent of the firefighters who perished on September 11th).<br />The disaster was the usual result of carelessness, bad luck and arrogant overconfidence.  When built, the Cherry Mine was thought to be fireproof, much like the Titanic was thought to be iceberg proof.  When the fire started, it wasn't taken seriously at first, indeed, the elevator operators continued to haul up coal for over an hour after the initial flames appeared.  By the time the danger became readilly apparent, it was too late for a majority of the miners.<br />Tintori adopts the correct tone for such a book, letting the words of the survivors speak for themselves whenever possible.  Her account of the twenty miners who spent several days trapped below ground and presumed dead before being rescued is particularly compelling, as are the verbatum words from a short journal written by a trapped miner who eventually suffocated.  Tintori may not quite have the narrative touch of say, Sebastian Junger or Jon Krakauer, but she is still quite good.<br />Overall, an excellent historical account of a very unfortunate trajedy.	2002-09-17

Brown's &quot;White Hurricane&quot; is yet another in the recent flood of books depicting historical weather releated disasters.  Indeed, the 1913 storm of the book's title is so little remembered that I had never heard of it prior to reading the book, despite growing up in the Great Lakes region.  Brown obviously did a copius amount of research and does a fine job describing the history of Great Lakes shipping and demonstrating the risks that sailors face when the &quot;gales of November&quot; start howling.<br />The 1913 Great Lakes storm was unusual both for its intensity and because it raged over the lakes for almost a full week rather than just a couple of days.  As a result, it claimed a dozen ships and nearly 250 lives.  Dozens of other ships barely escaped and the first hand accounts of the sailors who survived the tempest make for chilling reading.<br />The book's main drawback, however, is that it lacks a single compelling central event as a focus for its narrative.  Brown gamely switches back and forth between accounts of each individual ship as the storm progresses.  Unfortunately, there are far too many ships and sailors for the reader to keep easy track of and eventually all the accounts begin to sound the same.  On the plus side, the book provides several helpful maps as well as a generous helping of photographs, mostly of the ships that were lost.<br />Overall, an informative if not highly readable account of a largely forgotten weather disaster.	2002-09-12

As he showed in his classic account of the entire Civil War, &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom,&quot; McPherson is more interested in the political, social and even diplomatic aspects of America's deadliest conflict.  The point of the book is to argue that Antietam, not Gettysburg, was the pivital battle of the war.  McPhereson makes his argument by describing the events that led up to the battle and demonstrating how it affected what came after.<br />Antietam, McPherson argues was the moment when the South came the closest to winning diplomatic recognition from the European powers and a resulting negotiated settlement that would have secured its independence.  The aftermath of the Union &quot;victory&quot; at Antitam also persuaded Abraham Lincoln to finally issue the Emancipation Proclamation, turning the war once and for all into a battle against slavery.<br />McPherson is a first rate writer and historian, and his book is well reasearched and highly readable.  What it is short on, however, is accounts of the actual fighting, which resulted in the single bloodiest day in American history (far worse than even Pearl Harbor or September 11th).  The narrative clocks in at a brief 155 pages, only about a third of which are devoted to the battle.  Yet the book is well worth reading despite this flaw.<br /><br />Overall, a brief historical overview of an epic moment in American history by one of our most distinguished historians.	2002-09-11

Both are historical and social accounts of deadly hurricanes the struck the United States and took a much larger toll on human life than they should have because of regrettable human mistakes.  Larsen's book told the tale of the Glaveston Hurricane of 1900 that was the deadliest in U.S. history.  Drye's account, meanwhile, is of the Labor Day storm of 1935 that struck the Florida Keys and is suspected of being the strongest hurricane to make landfall in U.S. history.<br />Drye does not content himself with merely retelling the story of the strom and the mayhem it caused.  Instead he focuses on the lives of the islanders, most particularly on an unfortunate group of World War I veterans left destitute by the Great Depression and hired to build the highway that would eventually connect Key West with the mainland.  A large number of the veterans were trapped on the low level island and drowned as a hapless rescue train sent to retrieve them was blown of the tracks.  Their story and that of the bureaucratic bungling that left them to their fate is the book's most compelling part.<br />On the downside, Drye lacks the deft storytelling touch that helped make &quot;Issac's Storm&quot; so memorable.  The book is a bit over long for its subject at over 300 pages, lengthened considerably by a deteailed account of the ultimately futile investigations of the officals responsible for the veteran's welfare.  This part is not as compelling and at times displays a political bias against Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<br />Overall, a decent historical account of a horrific weather releated disaster.	2002-09-11

The book follows Jordan and the Bulls during their first championship season (1990-1991), before Jordan established himself as the most successful NBA player (in terms of championships) since Bill Russell.  What is largely forgotten today is that in his first six years in the NBA was thought of as a selfish ballplayer who would never win a championship because he was not a &quot;team player.&quot;  Enter coach Phil Jackson, who in his first year would manage to convince his star player that in order for his team to win the championship, he would need to rely more on his teammates.<br />Great sports books are usually the case of the right writer (Smith in this case) being in a position to cover the right story at just the right time (Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; is another example).  That is certainly the case here.  As a sports reporter for The Chicago Tribune, Smith had plenty of access to the team during that first championship run, and he interviewed all of the principals extensively.  Fortunately, Smith pulls no punches.  The book's title refers to the preferential treatment afforded to Jordan that was a constant source of irritation to his teammmates.  Then-Bulls Center Bill Cartwright, for example, is memorably qoted as saying that Jordan is, &quot;Maybe the greatest athelete ever to play any sport...He's just not a basketball player.&quot;<br />Overall, &quot;The Jordan Rules&quot; is that rare sports book that transcends the particular sport it covers and can be enjoyed by any sports fan.	2002-08-29

Other spies like Aldrich Ames or Robert Hanssen were disillusioned middle aged bureucrats whose spying was an outlet for their frustration as well as a source of additional income.  Boyce and Dalton, however, were young men who blundered into the spy game mostly because of boredom with their comfortable upper middle class upbringings.  Their betrayal of the country that allowed them to live such an easy life is as baffling, if not as horrific, as the later actions of the shooters at Columbine High School.<br />Those who enjoyed the popular movie starring Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn based on this book will particularly enjoy the details that the movie had to leave out.  Of the two, Boyce's story is the most tragic.  He was highly intellegent with a potentially bright future, and secured a position at defense contractor TRW with a Top Secret security clearance because of his retired FBI agent father's connections.  Lee, on the other hand, was a dropout and a drug dealer whose life was spiraling downward toward the inevitable bad conclusion.  One of the astonishing facts revealed in the book is just how many second chances Lee squandered along the way.  A child of less affluence would have ended up in prison long before he even had the chance to join Boyce in his spying.<br />Author/journalist Robert Lindsey is an excellent writer and he tells the story in such a way that it reads like a fiction thriller.  Lindsey reports astonishing facts such as the incredibly lax security at TRW without editorial comment, letting the events speak for themselves.  Lindsey's extensive interviews with all of the principals, including Boyce in particular, make for particularly compelling reading.<br />Overall, a well-written journalistic account of one of the most unfortunate of America's spy cases.	2002-08-29

I listen to his daily radio sports talk show religiously and have always enjoyed his sports columns in The Washington Post.  Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed by &quot;Pumping Irony.&quot;  The book is a collection of columns Tony wrote for The Post's Sunday Style section, none of which have anything to do with sports.  As Tony demonstrates on his radio show, he is capable of being quite funny when discussing topics other than sports.  He is much funnier, however, when he is being spontaneous on his show.  When he labors over the material and reduces it to the printed page, it just doesn't come off as well.  As a result, the book reads like one of the many recent books by various stand up comedians.  Without their comic delivery and timing, the jokes just don't have the same effect.<br />Overall, &quot;Pumping Irony&quot; is not the best place to enjoy the engaging wit of Tony Kornheiser.	2002-08-29

Adams, or \\"JQA\\" as historian/author Robert Remini refers to him, had a brilliant diplomatic and political career--albiet under his father's long shadow--before becoming president in a disputed election (the other similarity he shares with the current occupant of The White House).  Among his other major accomplishments, Adams the second negotiated the end of the war of 1812 and as Secretary of State formulated the priciples that would later become known as The Monroe Doctrine.  Unfortunately, Admas's skills as a diplomat were of little help during his largely unsuccessful presidency, in which he was overshadowed from the beginning by the popular Andrew Jackson, who bitterly opposed almost every move he made.  The split between the two would revive America's two party system after over a decade of dormancy.<br />Remini documents all of the major events of JQA's life, from the \\"corrupt bargain\\" with Henry Clay that propelled Adams to the presidency to his unhappy personal life.  For all of his brilliance, Adams was a tormented man, brutalized emotionally by his domineering mother (the otherwise revered Abigail) as well as by his failure to secure the hand of the one true love of his life.  The equally overbearing upbringing he fostered upon his own sons resulted in tragedy for two of them.<br />The sense the reader gets from Remini's book is that JQA was one of the more fascinating and tragic figures ever to become president.  Unfortunately, at only a brief 155 pages of narrative the book only scratches the surface of the man.  Still, Remini is a first rate writer and historian, and his easily readable prose makes this a very accessible work of history.<br />Overall, a breezy historical account documenting the life of an often overlooked president.	2002-08-28

The reason the death toll is so variable is because most of the victims were among the very poorest in a country that has a staggering numbers of such people.  Whole familes were killed, leaving nobody behind to report their deaths.  Authors Dominic Lapierre and Javier Moro recount the disaster by using the technique of the non-fiction novel rather than reporting the events in a straight narrative.  There are no notes and no bibliography, just a 400 page narrative of the story from the inception of the plans to build the Union Carbide plant to the aftermath of the tragedy.<br />The authors build the story through interviews with the workers at the plant, survivors from the city and several Union Carbide employees.  The tale that emerges is one of an unfortunately preventable disaster that occurred because of misguided corporate decisions, the faultiest of which was probably the decision to build and run such a technologically complex and potentially dangerous facility in a third world country in the first place.  Union Carbide also suffered from a misreading of the Indian marketplace and ultimately from a horribly misguided cost cutting plan that decimated safety proceedures at the plant and directly led to the disaster.<br />Lapierre and Moro are excellent writers whose prose is compellingly readable, though a bit overly dramatic at times.  The style of the book is likely to put off some readers, who may be expecting more straightforward reporting.  I should also note that the book concludes with an appeal for donations to help the poverty stricken in India, further illustrating that it is not a work of journalism.  Nevertheless, this is an important story that deserves to retold as a cautionary note to both big business and to governments.<br />Overall, a gruesome story of man made disaster that most readers will likely find both moving and enraging.will likely find both moving and enraging.	2002-08-22

Forrestal, which claimed the lives of 134 U.S. servicemen and horribly wounded many more, was very much overshadowed by The Vietnam War, which the ship was then fighting.  At a time when there were more casualties each week in the ground war and America's cities were erupting into racial and anti-war violence, the disaster quickly faded from the news.  Now, author Gergory A Freeman has done a terrific service to both the victims and survivors with his fair, well-balanced and highly readable account.<br />Give Freeman credit right off the bat for not attempting to cash in on the celebrity interest potential of then-navy pilot John McCain's narrow escape by unjustly playing up McCain's involvement.  In Freeman's story, McCain is just one more survivor, and one who made it out with only minor injuries.  The real story is one of a preventable trajedy, and Freeman does not shy away from the laying the blame for the disaster where it belongs, on the political leadership of the time and on the navy bureaucracy.<br />Freeman's account of the fire itself and resulting ordinance explosions as seen through the eyes of the survivors is absolute riveting.  He strikes just the right tone, relaying the horrible events without sensationalizing them.  The book's title come from a particularly poignant moment in which three trapped sailors uncomplainingly performed a final vital duty for their shipmates even as they knew they were about to die.  Theirs is just one of the many incredible stories that Freeman has unearthed.<br />Overall, \\"Sailors to the End\\" is an expertly written work of military history that should appeal to both military buffs as well as to general readers.	2002-08-21

And yet it is little remembered today because it occurred at the exact same time as another inferno was consuming the city of Chicago. While the Chicago fire may have wrought more impressive physical destruction, by comparison it was only one-tenth as deadly.<br />Authors Denise Gess and Willaim Lutz now recreate the history of the Preshtigo Fire for modern readers. They set the backdrop by telling a bit about the town before the fire and the people who inhabit it. Then they give accounts of the blaze through the eyes of those few who managed to survive. The descriptions of the blaze and particularly of its aftermath are unrelentingly gruesome and haunting. Gess and Lutz are fine writers. The book is well researched and highly readable. My only quibble is that at just over 220 pages of text it is a tad slight for a work of history.<br />Overall, \\"Firestorm at Preshtigo\\" is a haunting true life tale that should be of much appeal to history and disaster buffs.	2002-08-17

Schulz	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Coffee Table Book for Peanuts Fans	...featuring luscious graphics and design layouts, \\"The Art of Charles Schultz\\" is definately aimed at those who are already big fans of his work.  This is not a standard collection of comic strips.  Instead, there is commentary about the development of the strip and Schultz's devlopment as an artist.  The first 50 or so pages contain samplings of his pre-Peanuts work, which is fascinating for how it shows the development of his ideas.  Next the book provides a real service by providing a generous helping of the early Peanuts strips (circa 1950-54), many of which have never appeared in book form.  The characters look radically different and their personalities were just starting to settle in.  Charlie Brown was a bit of a dandy instead of always being a loser, Lucy was sort of an airhead and Snoopy didn't \\"talk\\" yet.<br />The book has a genrous helping of photographs of Schultz, his staff and of various Peanuts memorabilia.  The Sunday strips are rendered in glorious full color and there also rough drafts of strips that give an idea of how the creative process works.  The book's only drawback is that it is oddly laid out, with some strips cut in half at page breaks and other pages featuring minaturized strips, apparently to save page space.  Nevertheless, this book is of high enough quality that it will look good on any Peanut fan's coffee table.	2002-08-17

We have come to take instant communications so much for granted that we tend to forget that prior to a mere century-and-a-half ago, it took news many weeks to cross the world's great oceans.  Though dwarfed in memory by such other mammoth engineering feats such as the Panama Canal and the Brooklyn Bridge, the laying of the first Trans-Atlantic cable in 1866 was every bit important in the delvelopment of the modern world, if not more so.<br />Author John Steele Gordon tells the tale with easily readable prose and superb storytelling.  Along the way, he enhances the historical memory of Cyrus Field, the visionary entreprenuer whose single-minded devotion to the project kept it going despit many setbacks.  Field's project was the perfect marriage of private and public enterprize in an effort that greatly bennefitted both.  Field's story is as interesting as that of the cable itself.<br />The one main drawback to the book is that its brevity doesn't seem befitting of its subject matter, even more so since Gordon throws in a number of anecdotes that are sidelights to the main story.  He commits a major factual error with one of the side stories, stating inaccurately that General Zachary Taylor led the American Army to Mexico City during the Mexican War when in fact it was General Winfield Scott who accomplished that task.<br />Overall, despite a few flaws, &quot;A Thread Across the Ocean&quot; is a worthwhile read that will be of primary interest to history buffs.	2002-08-17

Nevertheless, it still works quite well as a one volume overview and comes at a very critical time in which the U.S. is again considering military action against the country.  It also chillingly portrays the trajedy that has befallen this turbulent country because of its unfortunate history and outlaw leadership.<br />The book mostly consists of historical accounts drawn from other sources.  Author Sandra Mackey did in fact visit Iraq while researching it, but she was very limited in where she could go or who she could talk to.  Her first person accounts of Saddam's totalitarian society are brief, but chilling in their implications.  Mackey uses them as a backdrop for her straightforward account of Iraqi history from Mesopitamina times until the present.  The story is a tragic one, of course, made even more so by the fact that the country enjoyed a brief period of prosperity before Saddam plunged it into the nightmares of the Iran/Iraq war, the Gulf War and internal genocides against the Shia and Kurd populations.<br />Mackey is a very good writer, and for the most part her prose is crisp and readable.  On the downside, she repeats herself a bit too much, and at nearly 400 pages the narrative lags a little at times.  Nevertheless, Mackey has provided a valuable service by giving Americans (and other Westerners) the chance to catch up on a subject that seems about to rivet the wrold's attention once again.  For that, I give it an enthusiastic recommendation.	2002-08-13

The author of &quot;Jaws,&quot; who became a hugely successful by using a shark to scare the wits out of people, now comes down on the side of sharks by trying to convince people of their admirable traits.  This is a noble gesture on Mr. Benchley's part, but it is delivered in such a half-hearted manner that he shouldn't have bothered.<br />The book contains very little actual reporting.  Instead, Benchley mostly realtes his own experiences with sharks and other dangerous sea faring critters.  He provides the reader with VERY little scientific information about sharks.  More surprisingly, he relates almost no third person shark stories, other than those told to him by his by mysterious &quot;friends&quot; (who he seldom names).  Instead, there is a chapter on ocean swimming safety, several in which Benchley lists (ad nauseam) every type of Marine life that is potentially harmful to humans, some &quot;Jaws&quot; anecdotes and a bizarre short fiction piece about what would happen if every shark on the planet were to be killed (say what???).<br />Given that the book is only 186 double-spaced pages to begin with, anyone with a real intrest in sharks will be sorely disappointed by the lack of real information provided.  Needless to say, Benchley's lightweight effort was huge disappointment.	2002-08-07

Unfortunately, this tragic tale of a killer tornado is conveyed with so much overloaded flowery literary prose as to render it virtually unreadable.  For example, here is a direct quote from page 70 describing the tornado: &quot;Cruel and without conscience, calculated in its killing, the wolf at the door was deadlier than the red-haired boy could ever have known.  The world rolled onto its side, the ground was pulled into the sky, the prayers for mercy given up were given back, and up into the dark column rose our sense of place and those who had made it so...&quot;<br />If passages like the above were lightly scattered throughout the book, it would be one thing.  But they appear repeatedly on just about every page.  Given that the victims of the tornado were, for the most part ordinary small town folk, the literary pretentions of the book seem even more inappropriate.  Author Lorian Hemingway had a close personal connection to the disaster, having moved from Jackson, Mississippi, as a teenager only a few months before it happened.  She knew most of the victims personally.  Nevertheless, I can't imagine that anyone who does not have a personal connection to the disaster will be able to make it to the end of this book.	2002-08-07

Whereas Friedman's book examined the broader perspective of Middle East politics, &quot;War Without End&quot; is concerned exclusively with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Addtionally, while Firedman's book used history as a backdrop for a telling of his own experiences, La Guardia's book concentrates on historical writing punctuated only occasionally by his first person accounts.<br />That said, La Guardia has produced an excellent one volume history of the conflict.  He sets the stage by explianing the origins of Zionism and of the European anti-Semetism that caused it to gain force.  He then gives an overview the history of the Ottoman and British rule over Palestine, the 1948 UN Mandate and Israeli War for Independence, and the subsequent Arab-Israeli conflicts.  After this, the rest of the book is devoted to the many conflicts between the Israelis and the Palenstinians as well as the internal conflicts between various factions within Israel and of the ineptitude of the PLO leadership.  La Guardia gives a balanced account, and is critical of the excesses and mistakes committed by both parties.<br />One comes away from the book with a clearer understanding of recent conflict.  Though chronologically disjointed, the narrative covers events all the way up until early 2002.  The odd structuring of the book is most likely due to the numerous rewrites La Guardia admits in the preface to doing as events continued to unfold.  His most valuable service is that, like with Friedman's book, he cuts through the ideological and religious issues to give readers a relatively clear picture of just what lies behind the world's most intractable conflict.<br />Overall, a well written and readable book that works a tad better as a work of history than as a work of journalism.ble book that works a tad better as a work of history than as a work of journalism.	2002-08-04

That he was able to survive as a Jew living in Lebanon during the height of the mid-80s kidnapping craze there is remarkable in and of itself.  \\"From Beruit to Jerusalem\\" is Friedman's account of his time in both capitals, one for which he justifiably won the Pulitzer prize.  Despite that somewhat limiting title, Friedman's focus is on the entire region as the key flashpoint in the modern world.<br />What makes the book so compelling is the way the Friedman uses history to paint the backdrop for his story.  He goes beyond a mere reporting of the facts and scratches behind the surface to the underlying reasons for the Middle East's many conflicts.  Friedman's reportage on Syrian president Assad's massacre of his own people in the city of Hama, for example, is used to explain how power politics reigns supreme among the unelected rulers of the Arab world, to the continuing detriment of their people.  On the flip side, Friedman is openly critical of Israel, particularly for the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and how the country responded to the first Palestinian uprising in the late 1980s.  Friedman's even handedness makes his work that much more valuable.<br />Though his observations are now more than a decade old, there are plenty of lessons here that remain valid today.  Though Lebanon has for the most part settled down since then, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is more dangerous than ever, especially in the wake of increased terrorist activity after September 11th.<br />Overall, a first rate work of journalism and history that is one the most important books released on the Middle East in the past twenty years.	2002-08-04

Edmund Morris won the Pulitzer prize with \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" and one of mega popular historian David McCullough's best loved books is \\"Mornings on Horseback.\\"  Additionally, Miller faces the fundamental problem that TR was really too complex a figure to be given his just due in a single volume.  The man himself was larger than life, and his biographies ought to be as well.<br />Nevertheless, Miller gives it his best shot.  His prose is very readable and he briskly covers each event in Roosevelt's busy life with aminimum of opinionating.  Those looking for a thorough examination of TR's presidency will be better off with Morris's recent \\"Theodore Rex,\\" as the two terms combined account for only about 140 of the 560 pages of narrative.  Roosevelt's post-presidential years get even less coverage, a mere 70 pages, despite the fact that he continued to be a major player on the American political scene for another decade.  These factors illustrate just how difficult was Miller's one volume task.<br />Overall, \\"Theodore Roosevelt: A Life\\" is a good bare bones introduction to one of America's most fascinating historical figures.	2002-08-03

Included are several first person accounts of his own adventures, including his life-defining attempt to climb the Devil's Thimb in Alaska as a young man and his later failed attempt to scale the Eiger face.  Krakauer also failed in his attempt to climb Mount McKinley, but manages to say more with one of his defeats than other climbers do with their success.<br />Krakauer also proves himself to be a first rate reporter with his accounts of other mountaineering stories.  Particularly good is his tale of John Gill, the man who practically invented \\"bouldering.\\"  Krakauer goes on to describe waterfall climbing, canyoneering and the horrors of being tent bound with his deft narrative touch.  At 186 pages, and featuring his easily readable prose, the book is a delightful experience for those who like good adventure stories of the kind featured in Outside Magazine.	2002-07-28

The book is coffee table size, and full of spectacular photographs of the mountain, mostly taken by the IMAX team.  The narrative that accompanies the images documents what happened during that terrible month, from the horrific deaths to climber David Breashears's team's successful summitting of the mountain with IMAX camera in tow.  The words read like a National Geographic article, however, giving only an overview of the events that occurred.  Krakauer's book is essential for a complete understanding of what happened.<br />Overall, a fine coffee table book for those with an interest in mountaineering as well as those fascinated by the May 1996 disaster.	2002-07-28

A plane carrying a group of Uruguayan rugby players crashed in the high Andes, leaving the survivors stranded for over two grueling months.  They resort to cannibalizing those who were killed in the crash in order to survive.  Eventually, several of the young men embarked on a desperate effort to reach civilization, succeeding just in time for the remaining survivors to be successfully rescued.<br />It's a horrific tale, and one that is very well told by author Piers Paul Read.  To his credit, Read avoids ...sensationalism.  He lets the words and actions of the survivors speak for themselves.  What ultimately emerges is a testament both to the survival instincts of the players and to their very humanity despite what they were forced to do.  The descriptions of the trek out of the mountains is so well described that it reads like a fiction thriller.<br />Overall, a well written and compassionate book that stands as a tribute both to the survivors and to those who died.	2002-07-28

It details very completely the history of the roving death squads who followed Adolf Hitler's armies into the conquered territories of the Soviet Union and unleashed the opening salvos of what would later become known as The Holocaust.  Many people today think of The Holocaust in terms of Auschwitz and the other death camps.  What tends to be forgotten is that the Eisatzgruppen units that started the mass killings of Jews racked up a death toll at least as high as those of the camps.  And in most instances, the murders by these minions were even less humane, if that's possible.<br />Rhodes, a fine writer and first rate historian, pulls no punches.  Wherever possible, he uses the first hand accounts of both the survivors and the perpetrators to tell his gruesome story.  The ghastly pictures that accompany the book only begin to hint and the true horror of the events described.  Along the way, Rhodes explores the psychology of the murderers, particularly that of both Hitler and of Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler, the man who allowed his whole personality to be subjugated to the Fuhrer.  Rhodes also provides enough of the history and ideology of Nazi Germany to set the proper context.<br />At just under three hundred pages of text, the book makes its point concisely.  Lest the reader think that what happened has been confined to the dustbin of history, Rhodes points out that Einsatzgruppen methods were recently resurrected by the death squads in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.<br />Overall, an incredibly powerful and important book that serves as a grim reminder of the darker side of human nature.	2002-07-28

It haunted me at the time, and it continues to do so today.  By now, the story has been told so many times and by so many different people that it hard to remember that Krakauer's original account is the one that made it famous to begin with.  Were it not for his incredible abilities as a storyteller, it is doubtful that anyone outside the world of mountaineering would remember what happened at the peak of Everest in that fateful May of 1996.<br />Krakauer's account is so compelling because it reads like a book length confession, which it is in a sense.  The author worked through his very considerable feelings of survivor's guilt in the book's pages.  His descriptions and not inconsiderable opinions have become legendary.  For example, how many people read of AOL Chairman Robert Pittman's recent outster from the company and remembered him as the husband of Sandra Hill Pittman, who personified the rich amature climber who buys their way to the top of the world's tallest peak and who has no business being there?  Krakauer's descriptions of Mrs. Pittman on the mountain are an example of his simple but devastating observations.<br />Krakauer's highly readable prose make the book read like fiction, probably another reason why it was so popular.  He signed on for the Everest climb intending to write a standard mountaineering magazine article.  That he chose the fateful May 1996 climb is simply a rare case of someone being at the wrong place at precisely the right time.  Though it caused him plenty of personal torment, it also allowed him to write a story for the ages.<br />Overall, &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; fantastic storytelling make it one of the best non-fiction books published in the last decade or so.	2002-07-28

Author Robert Frump was the leader of the investigative reporting team from the Philadelphia Enquirer that pursued the larger story behind the February 1983 sinking of the merchant marine vessel Marine Electric.  What they found was a civilian service plagued by reliance on ancient rustbucket ships, adherence to the corporate bottom line at the expense of safety, and an inspection system beholden to ship owners that ignored these problems.<br />The first third of the narrative deals with the sinking of the Marine Electric and the harrowing rescue effort that managed to save only three of the 37 crew members.  Most of the remaining two-thirds of the book documents the legal wrangling, political manuvering and Enquirer media pressure that ultimately led to reforms in the system.  Several heros emerge along the way, including survivor Bob Cusuik, who risked his career to tell the truth, and Coast Guard Officer Dom Calicchio, who bucked the military bureaucracy to his own detriment.  Additionally, the author documents his and his colleague's role without overstating it.  He also includes tales of other nautical disasters to serve as a backdrop to the main narrative.  The story might lack the concise punch of a book like &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; but it is still highly readable.<br />Overall, this is an excellent true nautical disaster tale that will be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys such stories.	2002-07-26

Oren bends over backward in &quot;Six Days of War&quot; to be an unbiased and objective reporter.  He succeeds in the attempt, though perhaps a bit too well.  His book is well researched and very balanced, showing the good and bad of both sides in what is the most important military engagement since World War Two (at least in terms of its lasting repercussions).  Oren meticuously documents the factors that led up to the war, paints portraits of the major political and military figures, and then lays out a day by day account of the battles.<br />The book's one drawback is that it is a bit dry at times.  Perhaps because Oren was being so careful to avoid anything that could be remotely interpreted as opinion, his writing lacks the narrative force that has marked the best works of recent historical writing.  Nevertheless, he has produced a very thorough account that covers all aspects of the war.  In light of recent developments in the Middle East, understanding what happened that fateful June more than 35 years ago has taken on even more importancance.<br />Overall, a thorough and complete history of the six day war that will appeal most strongly to military and Middle East history buffs.	2002-07-23

That's because a large amount of the great Roman orator's correspondence luckily has survived the 2000 plus years since his death.  Cicero was a great tragic figure, a conservative and a republican (small \\"r\\") fated to live in a time of great turmoil that resulted in the death of the Roman republic (and his own).  In the end, his philisophical writings helped crystalize Western thought and still affects academics and statesmen to this day.  All of this from a man who held the highest Roman Reublic office (that of Consul) for only one year and had little military experience in a time when great generals were both feared and revered.<br />Everitt tells Cicero's story in a superbly readable narrative style that marks the best history writing these days.  He explores his subject's political career and personal life while deftly setting the backdrop of the times in which he was a chief actor.  Everitt pays particular attention to Cicero's stormy life long relationship with Julius Ceasar, that archenemy of republicanism who nevertheless had a soft spot for the cantakerous philosopher.  Ceasar's assassination is the crucial event upon which Everitt's narrative pivots.<br />Overall, \\"Cicero\\" is an outstanding work of biography that will be greatly enjoyed by history buffs and even by more casual readers.	2002-07-22

It does focus on ten seperate instances of seaborne mayhem dating from the 1820s to the 1990s. But instead of including straightforward narrative accounts, author John Rousmaniere is more concerned with the literary and spiritual aspects of such events. The common thread that runs through these tales is that for the most part they all either affected or were commented upon by notable literary personalites, from Mary Shelley to Robert Louis Stevenson to Joseph Conrad and others. So much so that the accounts of the disasters themselves take a back seat to describing their social, psychological, religious and even political effects.<br />All in all there is nothing necessarily wrong with Rousmaniere's approach, except that its appeal will be limited to the interest that the reader has in the exteraneous subject matter. Unfortunately, the book's subtitle, \\"True Stories of Disaster and Recovery at Sea,\\" leads one to believe that it is a collection of adventure tales, which is really not the case.<br />Overall, I would recommend that potential readers closely scrutinize the summaries of this book's subject matter to determine if it will appeal to them.	2002-07-16

Along the way, he sets the record straight and rehabilitates the reputation of Captain William Kidd, the late 17th Century privateer and gentlemen who set out to hunt pirates with noble backing and ended up branded as one.  Kidd is a tragic hero of the first order.  Honorable (at least, by the standards of the time), resolute and with an unshakeable faith in his own abilities, he was laid low by an incredible run of double crosses and sheer bad luck.  Particularly touching were his devotion to his wife and his strong sense of duty, neither of which were ultimately enough to save him.<br />The book's other main character is the despicable Robert Culliford, an actual pirate who betrayed Kidd twice and whose fate was tied closely to the Captain.  Culliford's villany stands in sharp contrast to Kidd, giving the story a strong counterpoint.<br />Along the way Zacks, who demonstrates himself to be a meticulous researcher, paints a vivid portrait of the lives of sailors and pirates during the period.  Zacks's authentic descriptions of what it was like to be a real life pirate bears little resemblence to the modern literary and cinematic stereotypes.  His prose is vivid and highly readable, and the book feels more like a novel than a work of history as a result.  My only quibble is the Zacks occasionally gets a little TOO bogged down in the details, as evidenced by the narrative's 400 plus pages.<br />Nevertheless, overall \\"The Pirate Hunter\\" is an excellent read for those who enjoy nautical history tales.	2002-07-13

There is plenty of evidence suggesting that this is more than historical speculation, even though all of it is circumstantial.  The first half of the book is dedicated to a retelling of Alexander's reign, which featured spectacular successes (the defeat of Napolean) and personal torment (guilt over his own complicity in his father's murder).  The picture that emerges is of a (relatively) enlightened Russian monarch who would very much have preferred not to be the king.<br />The book goes on to recount the life of the mysterious Siberian vagabond that many Russians, including descendents of the Romanov dynasty, have come to believe WAS Alexander.  If so, he shed the Imperial life about as completely as anyone ever could.  Once again, the evidence is far from conclusive, but still compelling.  Troubetzkoy is a good storyteller, and his narrative is highly readable.<br />Overall, \\"Imperial Legend\\" is a good historical mystery that should be enjoyed by history buffs with an interest in Imperial Russia.	2002-07-06

Granted, TR was such a fascinating figure that it would be hard to write an uninteresting account of his life, but through his clever use of anecdotes, Morris paints a lasting picture of the man who was (arguably) the greatest peacetime President in American history.<br />\\"Theodore Rex\\" picks up where Morris's first volume about TR (\\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt) left off, and we join \\"Teddy\\" as he is preparing to take the oath of office upon the death of his predecessor, William McKinley. In 555 pages, The book neatly covers the seven and a half years of TR's rule, ending on March 4, 1909, as he watches his reluctant handpicked successor, Willam Howard Taft, take the oath. In between, Morris describes one of America's most dynamic and eventful administrations. Morris aptly describes TR's genius as well as his faults. His triumphs and failures get equal treatment and examination. Thoughout, Morris's prose is lively and highly readable.<br />Overall, \\"Theodore Rex\\" is certain to rank among the best works of history this year and will also take its place as one of the best Presidential biographies ever written.	2002-07-06

I love the notion of morons offing themselves through their own stupidity.  Now that someone has decided to cash in by putting them in book form, they have unfortunately lost their charm.  Problem number one is that in order to pad the material for now two full volumes, lots of stuff has been put in that doesn't belong.  Many of these so-called \\"winners\\" don't deserve Darwins because either 1). they didn't die or 2). the story itself is either unverified or an actual urban legend.  The author also throws in a lot of stupid criminal anecdotes, which also don't deserve Darwins and are the same exact stories that have previous appeared in things like News of the Weird.<br />The other comment I would make is that the Darwin Awards were written up to much funnier effect when they were being posted anonymously on the Internet.  Author Wendy Northcutt has actually managed to, uh, drain the life right out of them with her unfunny prose.<br />Overall, get 'em from the 'net and don't waste your money.	2002-06-29

Certainly, Ousby was a diligent researcher and a very astute historian.  Unfortunately, the book's plodding prose and strange configuration (for example, a 58 page prologue!) have mangaged to drain all but the most scholarly interest from the famous World War I &quot;battle&quot; in which there were more than 700,000 casualties.  Great works of history, particularly military history, make the past come alive in such a way that expands interest in the subject matter well beyond the academic world.  Ultimately, &quot;The Road to Verdun&quot; doesn't come close to doing that.	2002-06-29

It is, in fact, an accurate reflection of the contents of Bret Easton Ellis's \\"American Psycho.\\"  It is more disturbing to read than the movie \\"Henry; Portrait of a Serial Killer\\" is to watch, perhaps because no film could possibly accurately portray the ugly horror of some of the book's more graphic passages (I haven't seen the movie version of this book, but I can't imagine that it wasn't CONSIDERABLY watered down).<br />The book is written in a rambling first person (emphasis on the \\"rambling.\\"  For example, one paragraph goes on for an excrutiating FIVE pages).  We see the action through the eyes of Patrick Bateman, who is a high living Wall Street investment banker (I guess, Bateman never really says what it is exactly that he does).  He and his utterly vapid friends spend most of their time in trendy restaurants and clubs having endless discussions about such completely inane topics as tabloid TV shows, proper men's attire and the best brands of bottled water.  Meanwhile, in his spare time Batemen kills people, especially women.  The scenes of him sexually torturing some of his victims before killing them are particularly hard to take.  In between it all you get odd bits like lengthy reviews of Genesis, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and the News that read like they were written by an actual music critic.<br />I guess the whole thing was meant to be taken tongue and cheek, but the story lacks any narrative force and at 400 pages reads like a Unabomber manifesto.  It is most definately NOT for the squeamish, and though I admire Easton's gifted talent in writing it, I can't imagine what compelled him to do so.	2002-06-25
1498523:US	51809405	R39X2IJQIE4ASQ	0679427724	555570204	Shakey: Neil Young's Biography	Books	4	67	76	N	N	A Whole Lot of &quot;Shakey&quot; Goin' On	I'm a huge Neil Young fan, with over two dozen of his albums in my collection.  But I'm not a fanatic, and as a result I found his biography, &quot;Shakey&quot; to be as stimulating, but as frustratingly erratic as the artist himself.  One thing Neil Young could never be accused of is self-censorship, and author Jimmy McDonough writes about him in the same vein, telling in nearly 800 pages a stoory that could have been more succinctly and powerfully conveyed in about half that number.  McDonough spent over ten years working on the book, however, and I guess he felt that his huge investment of time justifies the book's length.<br />The book is a rambling narrative of Young's life, mainly as seen through the eyes of his closest associates, but is told in the Hunter S. Thompson &quot;gonzo&quot; style of journalism as McDonough frequently inserts himself into the story.  There is nothing necessarily wrong with this approach, in may have in fact been necessary, but it ends up padding the length.  The main story is interspersed with a hundred or so pages of text from McDonough's various interviews with Young in which the artist is quoted verbaitim.  It is a fascinating and unprecedented look into Young's mind, but again it starts to become wearing after awhile.  Lengthy passages about such relatively uninteresting subjects as Young's passion for model trains slow things down even further.<br />Ultimately, &quot;Shakey&quot; is likely to be endured only by Young's most ardent fans and will not win the artist any new converts.  But I get the feeling that Young would prefer it that way.  As McDonough recounts, the quickest way to get Young to drop a song from an album is to tell him its going to be a surefire hit.  He is that rare rock star who actually eschews popularity.  Young remains a startlingly original talent after nearly four decades in the recording busines and for all of its flaws, &quot;Shakey&quot; manages to capture his essence.	2002-06-25

Thanks to his incredibly dedicated research and excellent storytelling ability, he was able to  resurrect the quickly fading memory of America's military &quot;debacle&quot; in Somalia and give the troops who fought (and died) there their proper due.  For the most part, Bowden doesn't get bogged down with the details of WHY the U.N. and American troops were in Somlaia in the first place (though he does give enough of an overview to set the proper context), nor does he go in depth  into how Somalia descended into lawlessness.  Bowden's story is of the soldiers, and it is a story he tells as well as any combat chronicler has ever done.<br />Bowden focusses on the soldiers of Delta Force and of the U.S. Army Rangers who on October 3, 1993, were sent on a daylight mission ointo the section of Mogadishu controlled by Warlord Mohamed Aidid two apprehend two of Aided's top lieutenants.  Despite popular perceptions (fueled by the media) that the mission was a disaster, it was actually a tactical success.  The force captured its targets and at the same time inflicted tremendous casualties (many times their own) on Aided's forces.  Unfortunately, the political leadership in the U.S. and the American media focussed intead on the two downed Blackhawk helicopters and the deaths of 18 soldiers.  What was overlooked was the fact that the American casualties were among America's most elite fighters who had all volunteered to join the units they were in with the expectation that they would someday get tested in real combat.  Bowden drives this point home relentlessly.<br />The battle scens in the book are incredibly detailed and told from every point of view (even that of the Somalis, some of whom Bowden interviewed).  Bowden is also scrupulously fair, letting the participants speak for themselves and not censoring them when they criticize each other.  The book's most valuable portion, however, is the epiloge, where Bowden reports the soldiers' biggest disappointment was that right after the battle,  President Clinton, pushed by Congress, decided to get out of Somalia and leave Aidid in place.  In other words, they had fought the battle in vain.<br />Overall, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is one of the best military history books written in the past decade or so.disappointment was that right after the battle,  President Clinton, pushed by Congress, decided to get out of Somalia and leave Aidid in place.

Had he not been a Royal, Crown Prince Dipendra would still have to go down as one of the most diabolical mass murderers in history.  In all, he managed to kill his entire immediate family and five other close relatives in quick succession before turning his gun on himself.<br />Author Jonathan Gregson sets the table by recounting the entire history of Nepal's royal family, which stretches back to the mid eighteenth century.  To say that the dynasty has had an unhappy history is an understatement, and after awhile the numerous accounts of Royal bloodletting become monotonous.  Nevertheless, this history is vital to the story.<br />Flash forward to June 1, 2001.  The Crown Prince is an unhappy man of thirty. An alcoholic and a drug addict, he has been denied permission to marry the woman he loves by his domineering mother and threatened with being removed from the line of succession to the throne.  Gregson sets all of this up well and then recounts the bloody events as they happened.  The secrective nature of Nepal's royal family and the god-like awe to which the king is still held there seems to have smewhat stunted Gregson's narrative.  Still, he does a fine job with what he was able to decipher.  Along the way, he paints a vivid portrait of a fiercely proud third world country that is forever wrestling with the conflict between traditionalism and modernism.<br />Overall, \\"Massacre at the Palace\\" is an enlightening book that is full of surprises.	2002-06-12
1512360:US	51809405	R3KSK7C2TT5C1A	0743222172	78011641	The Sea Shall Embrace Them: The Tragic Story of the Steamship Arctic	Books	4	3	5	N	N	More Disaster on the High Seas	The recent resurgence of interest in The Titanic disaster has led to a whole slew of books recounting historical shipwrecks.  Some have been obviously just been attempts to cash in on Titanic-mania, while others have diligently recounted the events they chronicle.  Fortunately, \\"The Seas Shall Embrace Them\\" is in the latter category.  Author David W. Shaw sets the backdrop nicely, explaining how the U.S. merchant marine challenged Great Britian's supremacy in the Trans-Atlantic trade during the first half of the 19th century.  A great race was on to see who could build the fastest and most luxurious steamships.  Unfortunately, as both sides broke each other's time records, concerns such as safety inevitably got the short shrift.<br />Enter Captain James C. Luce and his steamship The Arctic, which struck another vessle in the waters off Newfoundland in late September of 1854 and sank in about five hours.  There were not enough lifeboats abord the vessle, and many among the crew violated the cardinal rule that their passengers should be saved first.  Luce and several men loyal to him tried valiently to prevent it from happening, though their efforts proved futile.  All of The Arctic's women and children passengers, including Luce's own sickly son, died.  Luce himself was determined to go down with the ship, but survived by a strange twist of fate to become a tragic hero.  The account of the sinking and rescue is chilling to say the least.<br />Author Shaw is a good storyteller.  The only flaw with the book is that at a brief 213 pages of text, the narrative is not quite as fleshed out as perhaps it should have been.  Nevertheless, it is still a good read for anyone who likes a good nautical adventure tale.	2002-06-12
1517622:US	51809405	R2L8D2JS92CUJS	0393041638	125161689	Mutiny on the Globe: The Fatal Voyage of Samuel Comstock	Books	3	12	16	N	N	Not as Good as Some Other Recent Nautical Books	There has been quite a glut lately of books about nautical disasters, both recent and historic.  Some like &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; and &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; have been excellent.  Others have been less so.  Unfortunately, &quot;Mutiny on the Globe,&quot; while not awful, belongs in the latter category.  It faces some tough competition, being one of two books released this year on the savage mutiny led bed Nantucket whaleman Samuel Comstock in 1822.  It is also in competition with &quot;Batavia's Graveyard,&quot; another book released a couple of months ago about a historical mutiny which is far superior to this one.<br />Part of the problem is that only a brief portion of &quot;Mutiny on the Globe&quot; is devoted to the voyage and the mutiny itself.  Author Thomas Heffernan spends a long time detailing the early life of Smauel Comstock, which is not all that interesting and pales by comparison to &quot;Batavia's Graveyard&quot;'s gruesome accounts of life at sea during the so-called golden age of sail.  The book is also strangely lacking in details about Nantucket whaling, which were so memorable in &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; (the events of which took place around the same time).  The last third of the narrative is devoted to the stories of the survivors of the mutiny, though the accounts of the two sailors who were forced to live in captivity among Marshall Island natives for two years before being rescued are also not worth the amount of narrative space they are given.<br />Heffernan is a decent storyteller and tries his best to liven up his tale.  The main problem seems to be that the material he had to work with seems more suited to a long magazine article than a full length book.	2002-06-07

Once and for all it does away with the myth that before World War Two, America was completely \\"isolationist\\" in its foreign policy.  The book focuses on America's many \\"smaller\\" military actions, from the Tripolitan War circa 1801-1803 to the hundred years (1840-1941) that American troops were continuously stationed in China to the Phillippine \\"Insurrection\\" (1900-1902) to the many 20th Century American interventions in Latin America.<br />Surprises abound, the biggest being how Author Max Boot demonstrates that for the most part America's interventions happened for idealistic reasons, rather than the usual sterotype that has the U.S. always watching out for big business interests.  Also surprising is Boot's account of how effective America was at fighting anti-guerilla wars, at least up until Vietnam, when our misguided tactics may have actually snatched victory from our grasp.  Boot covers each intervention seperately, combining politics with actual battle narratives in an excellently readable manner.  Colorful figures emerge, like \\"The Fight Quaker\\" Marine General Smedley Butler, who for over thirty years was America's foremost (and most successful) guerilla fighter, only to become a staunch pacifist upon retirement.<br />Though it is a historical narrative, it is obvious that the author is trying to send a message to today's military leaders, especially in the wake of such misguided post-Vietnam policies as the \\"Powell Doctorine.\\"  The message is that America has a duty to continue to fight small wars to make the world a safer place (especially after September 11th), but that it should also not encorage our enemies by cutting and running from such engagements after the first casualties.<br />Overall, Boot has wrtitten and extremely enjoyable military history book that carries with it a powerful message.	2002-06-04

Unfortunately, it falls way short of expectations.  Kerr is a master at creating memorable characters and scenes.  This time out, however, his story is populated by a group of people who fail to generate much interest (even his main villian is just your standard issue bad guy and is bumped off well before the climax).<br />The backdrop against which the story is set has some interesting aspects.  There's a computer generated assistant who is also a marital aid as well as a deadly Aids-like virus that has infected over 80% of the Eath's population, making unifected blood a commodity more valuable than gold.  The polt, however, unfolds slowly, stalls and never really regain momentum.  Annoying grammatical embellishments like the numerous footnotes (bizarre in a work of fiction) and the \\"author-narrator\\" repeatedly injecting himself into the story serve mainly as irritating distractions.<br />Overall, this is a disappointing work from an author who has produced many excellent works in the past.	2002-05-27

That said, it features some of the best rock and roll criticism (and writing) anywhere.  It purports to cover so-called &quot;alternative rock,&quot; which even editor and major contributor Ira Robbins freely admits is a fuzzy definition at best.  The artists included range from rap to heavy metal to college rock to punk to &quot;alternative&quot; country and everything in between.  The main requirement is that they have to have released albums in the 1990s.  Hence many rock icons of the new wave 1980s are missing from this latest volume.  The artists also range from the megastar level (R.E.M., U2, Metallica) to the truly obscure (Uncle Joe's Big Ol' Driver?).  The one constant is the writing, which is uniformly excellent.  As music guides go, this one is top of the line.	2002-05-24

It is a very complete political history of U.S. involvement in the Phillippines and how American influence has shaped that country.  It is, in fact, as much a history of the United States during the same period, giving detailed portraits of important figures like William Howard Taft, who was the first civilian governor of the Phillippines after America won the colony from Spain in the Spanish American War, and who considered the islands to his personal political domain, even after he became President in 1909.  Another American who looms large is, of course, General Douglas MacArthur, whose father Arthur fought during the little remembered Phillippine insurrection against American rule at the turn of the last century and who became an icon to the Phillippine people despite his serious personality flaws.<br />Karnow begins the book with an overview of Phillippine history under Spanish rule that sets the stage quite well.  He then describes America's conquest and subsequent torment as it found itself bogged down in a jungle guerilla war quagmire that unfortunately portended the Vietnam War six and a half decades later.  Over 100,000 Phillippinos and 4,000 American soldiers died in one of the bloodiest colonial wars ever.  Once the islands were finally subdued, however, America became the most benevolent of all colonial powers, granting the Phillippines unprecedented autonomy and zealously undertaking to educate its people and improve its infastructure.  After World War Two, the U.S. became the first colonial power to voluntarily relenquish a colony, granting the Phillippnes full independence with a minimum of fuss.<br />Overall, Karnow's book is a very throroughly researched and highly readable account.  It is also very well balanced, and describes America's colonial experience fairly.  One comes away from the book conflicted about whether the America's colonial rule in the Phillippines was ultimately a good thing or a bad thing.  Certainly, there are plenty of arguments on both sides.ines was ultimately a good thing or a bad thing.  Certainly, there are plenty of arguments on both sides.	2002-05-17

Like \\"Killer,\\" Frank Dillon, the protagonist here, has deep rooted issues involving women.  In fact, the woman of the title could be any of several he describes, including his hell-on-wheels wife.  The plot is right out of classic noir, as Dillon hatches an elaborate double murder scheme in order to make a huge score, win the girl he loves and escape his small town life and cruddy job as a salesman working for an abusive boss.  Things go awry, as they usually do in these tales, and Dillon has to resort to further violence in a vain attempt to keep his plans from unravelling.<br />The frank sexuality, gritty violence an unrepentant nature of the central character were probably quite a shock to readers when this book was first published in the early 1950s.  It will, however, seem fairly tame to modern readers.  A quick read at 185 pages, it is the novel equivilent of film noir from the era of its publication, and can be enjoyed the same way those films are today.	2002-05-17

Thompson's protagonist, small town deputy sheriff Lou Ford, tells his tale of murder and mayhem in the first person, which adds to the book's sense of dread.  1950s-era notions of morality and chivalry are also key to the development of the plot.  A prosecutor can, for example, accuse a man of murder while questioning him, but it isn't good form to degrade his mother by calling him an S.O.B. while doing so.  The only caveat to recommending this book is that its shock value is somewhat diminished by the many real life horrors our modern society has witnessed since it first hit the shelves.<br />A quick page turner and relatively brief at 244 pages, this is one tough \\"Killer.\\"	2002-05-14

Books	4	0	1	N	N	Informative if a Bit Meandering	Diana Preston's book about The Boxer Rebellion is well researched and does justice to its subject.  The terrible events of the summer of 1900 in China still have enormous implications for the country and its relations with the West, particularly the United States.  The Boxers were a shadowy legion of xenophobic marauders whose movement spread like wildfire in the wake of drought and national humiliation.  Once the anti-foreigner fever was whipped up, China's dynastic rulers decided to use it in an attempt to drive the foreign powers from its soil.  It was a foolhardy decision, at best.<br />Preston focuses primarily on the plight of the foreigners, including members of the British, American, German, Italian, Japanese and Russian legations; who were for the most part able to put aside their national rivalries and fight for their own survival.  The tale of their beseigement in Peking is the book's central story.  Preston also chronicles the disasters and triumphs of the inetrnational military expedition that finally managed to liberate their countrymen.  If the book has a flaw, it is that it tends to meander at times and is somewhat dull in places.<br />Overall, this is a decent work of history that revives interest in a subject that is mostly forgotten in the West, but still well remembered in China.  It should be read by anyone who wants to understand how China arrived where it is today.	2002-05-07

Unfortunately, that's exactly what there isn't a whole lot of in this collection.  It is a strange gathering of newer stories and older ones that for the most part are lacking in actual battles.  The best of the bunch is Joe Haldeman's \\"Time Piece\\" from 1970, which is the prototype story for what would later become \\"The Forever War.\\"  Stephen Baxter's new (2000) \\"On the Orion Line\\" is perhaps the best actual combat story included.  Paul J. McAuley's \\"The Gardens of Saturn,\\" and William Barton's \\"Soldier's Home\\" are about the aftermath of war.  The rest truly are a mixed bag.  There's nothing here remotely on the level of Phillip K. Dick's riveting novella \\"Second Variety,\\" which was  the literary godfather of the Terminator moveies and should be the lead whenever an anthology of sci-fi war stories is put together.<br />Overall, \\"Space Soldiers\\" is a disappointing collection of second rate military science fiction.	2002-05-07

Ten fishermen lost their lives in that brief period, easily the worst month for Atlantic fisherman in the modern age.  The book is clearly intended to appeal to those who enjoyed Sebastian Junger's \\"The Perfect Storm\\" (and  even mentions Junger's book several times).  That said, author Douglas A. Campbell lacks Junger's storytelling touch, though he is a obviously a very good reporter.<br />Like \\"Storm\\", this book details the lives of the oridinary men (no women here) who risk their lives in what is perhaps the most dangerous profession in America.  Clam fishing is portrayed as exhausting and unglamorous profession that appeals to the the blue collar types who do it for the large paychecks and the relatively unrestrained lifestyle.  Campbell also unflinchingly details the problems in the industry, from the considerable level or drug use to the obstinate nature of fisherman when it comes to the safety regulations designed to prevent disasters.  He also goes into considerable detail about the personal lives of the men who died and survived on each of the four boats.  The fact that there were really four seperate incidents does prevent his book from having the same concise narrative as \\"Storm.\\"<br />Overall, this book is yet another fine entry in the recent glut about the perils of commercial fishing that have appeared in the wake of \\"The Perfect Storm.\\"  It should appeal to anyone with an interest in the subject matter.	2002-05-04

With \\"Batavia's Graveyard,\\" author Mike Dash proves he has the knack. Even though it contains over 100 pages of notes and sources, which indicate that it was exhaustively researched, Dash strikes just the right balance between being a storyteller and being informative. The key players, both good and evil, come alive in the book's pages and the backdrop in which they appear is expertly painted.<br />Luckilly for Dash, his central character is one of the most diabolical real life villians imaginable. Jeronimus Cornelisz, a heretical merchantman, led a mutiny among the survivors of the ship Batavia after it was wrecked off the coast of Australia in 1628 that resulted in the horrifying deaths of nearly 120 of his shipmates and passengers, including nearly all of the women and children. Cornelisz and his band of cutthroats spared almost no one who was marooned with them.<br />Author Dash recounts the voyage, the wreck, the saga of the survivors, and their eventual rescue. If not for Cornelisz's treachery, it is likely that nearly all of those killed would have survived. Dash the goes on to recount the punishment of those responsible, one of the book's more grisly passages. His graphic descriptions of shipboard life in the 17th Centruy should further dispell any remaining romantic notions regarding the golden age of sail.<br />Overall, this is a first rate piece of history writing that should appeal to anyone who likes narrative history and particularly nautical disaster buffs.	2002-04-29

Nearly 1700 passengers and crew were rescued from the ship after its collision with another liner, The Stockholm.  Goldstein starts his story by developing the backgrounds of the key players, the two captains, the mate who was on watch on The Stockholm's bridge at the time of the collision, and many of the key passengers.  He then takes the reader on board both ships during their journeys and in the fatal moments before the crash.  The rest of the book deals with the rescue efforts and the heros (an yes, a few villians) that emerged from it.<br />Goldstein also recounts the international politics of the disaster (involving the governments and national pride of both Italy and Sweeden) and the history of Trans Atlantic travel that help give it the proper context.  A little touch like including the fact that Walter Lord's bestellar about the Titanic disaster, &quot;A Night to Remember,&quot; had just come out and helped increase passenger anxiety makes the narrative seeme even more real.  He explains the mistakes that led to the collision and deals well with the aftermath, including trhe settling of the myriad of lawsuits that resulted.  Many of the stories are first hand accounts from the survivors, which increases their effectiveness.  Goldstein possesses a good narrative touch as a historical author, and if the book has a flaw, it is that at times it is a bit too detailed.<br />Overall, an &quot;Desperate Hours&quot; is fine reading for nautical disaster buffs and anyone with an interest in seafaring stories in genereal.	2002-04-29

Rather, the book reads like these were the best stories the publishers could get the rights for.  The husband and wife editing team of Bill Pronzini and Marcia Muller are first rate mystery writers themselves (and each contribute one story to this collection), and they have come up with a few dandys.  Loren Estlemen's &quot;Greektown,&quot; for example, is among his best Amos Walker shorts, while Pronzini's own &quot;Stacked Deck&quot; may his best ever short story.  Lawrence Block is rightfully included, though he produced many stories in the 1980s better than &quot;As Good as the Rest,&quot; which was included.  Several of the stories truly don't rank with the best, and at least one, Clark Howard's &quot;The Dakar Run,&quot; barely qualifies as a mystery story.<br />At a mere 310 pages of text, the book is also far too short to cover an entire decade.  Overall, this is a fairly undistinguished collection of shorts, despite the book's grandiose title.	2002-04-29

That should be the book's caveat, as many of the protagonists had already appeared in full length novel form before these stories were published.  The lineup includes such luminaries as Loren Estlemen's Amos Walker, Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder, Bill Pronzini's &quot;Nameless&quot; and Editor Robert J. Randisi's own Miles Jacoby.  All of the series characters featured are currently ongoing (or at least were as of 1996, when the book was published).  Editor Randisi knows his stuff, having been the founder of the Private Eye Writers of America.<br />All that said, the quality of the stories varies.  Some of the writers had yet to really find their voice and some (especially the older) stories are somewhat by-the-numbers.  Nevertheless, the book is an inetersting historical artifactfor those who want insight on how their heros developed.  My personal favorites are Block's and Estlemen's.  They show again why they are, for my money, the two best and most consistent private eye writers currently working in the genre.	2002-04-23

While most of the scenarios of the first collection concentrated on military battles, the second features a lot of political twists and turns as well.<br />The alternate scnerios this time out include, &quot;What if Socrates had been killed at the Battle of Delium before he made his mark on Greek philosophy?&quot;  &quot;What if William the Conqueror had not won the Battle of Hastings?&quot; &quot;What if Martin Luther had been executed in 1521?&quot;  &quot;What if the Germans hadn't transported Lenin to Russia in 1917?&quot; &quot;What if the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 had been avoided?&quot;  &quot;What if FDR hadn't allowed the progressive Henry Wallace to be dumped as VP in 1944 in favor of Harry Truman?&quot;  Indeed, &quot;What if any of seven plausible scenerios had kept FDR from the Presidency?&quot;  All of these are great questions, presented in the highly readable narrative style that has come to define this series.<br />My only quibble is that a number of the essays present the questions without really giving an answer.  One is left to ponder the &quot;What Ifs&quot; without the essayist presenting the likely alternate reality.  Nevertheless, this is still a very enjoyable read for those with a passion for history.	2002-04-21

The battle was also an epic naval encounter between modern battleships and cruisers, a harbinger of the British-German naval battles in the North Seas of World War One.<br />\\"The Tsar's Last Armada\\" tells this story almost totally from the Russian's point of view.  The Russian Fleet had to sail from The Baltic Sea and around the Cape of Good Hope (almost 18,000 miles!) just to get to the engagement.  The endeavor was doomed almost from the beginning by Russian government corruption and international intrigue (the British, while officially neutral, gave much assistance to their Japanese allies).  The book's main protagonist, Russian admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, comes off as a sympathetic victim of circumstance, an honorable man doomed by his oath to the Tsar to carry through with an endeavor he knew was doomed to fail.<br />Auther Konstantin Pleshakov writes in a narrative, stoerytelling style that makes the book an interesting read, though sometimes his rhetorical flourishes (like repeatedly referring to Tsar Nicholas as \\"Nicky\\" and Kaiser Wilhelm as \\"Willy\\") can sometimes be annoying).  The book also suffers from a lack of a Japanese perspective.  For example, just enough is revealed about Admiral Togo to leave you wishing there was more.  Overall, however, \\"The Tsar's Last Armada,\\" is a fascinating work of history that will especially be of interest to naval warfare buffs.	2002-04-07

Published in 1985, &quot;Graveyard Plots&quot; is a selection of 23 stories chosen (as the author states in his premise) from the over 150! works of short crime fiction he had produced up until then.  The best of these include &quot;Cain's Mark,&quot; &quot;Strangers in the Fog,&quot; &quot;Rebound&quot; and &quot;Smuggler's Island.&quot;  There are also three &quot;Nameless&quot; Detective shorts, the best of which is the clever &quot;Skeleton Rattle Your Mouldy Leg.&quot;<br />Many of the stories are quite short (as few as five pages), and the book clocks in at a mere 255 pages of text.  Nevertheless, it is a very good collection by an author who personifies the term &quot;professional writer.&quot;	2002-04-03

O'Rourke continues his recent trend of attempting to tie his various magazine articles together thematically.  It worked brilliantly in his previous effort, the economics made funny tome \\"Eat the Rich.\\"  It works less well here.  \\"CEO,\\" for the most part, focuses on domestic American life, rather than O'Rourke's usual travel writing.  Parts of the book are VERY funny (particularly the first chapter, in which he gives the UN a well deserved bludgeoning).  Other good rants involve modern celebrities and the inane 2000 Presidential campaign.<br />Unfortunately, the unifying theme of this work, the author sitting around the house with his family, is patently annoying.  He also throws in some material, like the drunk wine tasting, that very much reads like filler material.  Additionally, some of his pre-September 11th cracks (like the ones about Rudolf Guiliani and Osama Bin Laden) seem short sighted and inappropriate now.  Overall, this book would have been stronger had O'Rourke just bound up a collection of the original articles instead of trying to unify them.	2002-03-28

It is a varied collection of (mostly) fine mystery and crime stories, many by up and coming authors.  I'll confess that two or three of them didn't work for me, but that's a very small number in a book than contains 20 stories and nearly 480 pages of text.  My two favorites were by two of the few old names in the collection.  Dennis Lehane spins an excellent down south slice of life tale in &quot;Running Out of Dog,&quot; while longtime television writer and children's author, the late Shel Silverstein, chimes in with the light-in-tone but still serious courtroom story &quot;The Guilty Party.&quot;  Doug Allyn contributes a fine private eye tale with &quot;Miracles! Happen!&quot; while Barbara D'Amato spins an on-the-road yarn with a twist in &quot;Motel 66.&quot;  Also first rate are Tom Franklin's &quot;Grit,&quot; and the down and dirty gangster in the hospital tale &quot;ICU.&quot;<br />Basically, there's a mystery story here for just about every type of mystery fan, from hard-boiled detective tales, to crime stories, to amature sleuths to compelling whodunnits?  Modern short stories do not get nearly the audience they should, and this is a book that deserves to be read.<br />(Note:  The 2000 &quot;Best Mystery Stories&quot; collection is far superior to the 2001 anthology, mostly because it has a better variety of stories).	2002-03-28

King is perhaps the best and most consistent short story writer working in genre fiction today (number two would probably be Lawrence Block).  The sheer number of first rate ideas he has cranked out over the course of the four volumes is nothing short of incredible.<br />Having said all that, \\"Everything's Eventual,\\" while a decent collection, is not quite up to the standards of the previous three (which, for the record are \\"Night Shift,\\" \\"Skeleton Crew\\" and the aforesaid \\"Nightmares...\\").  The first thing I noticed was that it is a bit short on actual horror stories, though \\"The Road Virus Heads North,\\" \\"The Man in the Black Suit,\\" and \\"1408\\" are among his best pure horror stories.<br />Of the rest, \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton,\\" \\"All that You Love Will be Carried Away,\\" and \\"In the Deathroom\\" are first rate stories (like \\"Dolan's Cadilac\\" from \\"Nightmares...\\") that belong in the mystery/crime category.  \\"Autopsy Room Four\\" and \\"Lunch at the Gotham Cafe\\" are creepy suspense stories that feature no supernatural elements.  The rest, including one \\"Dark Tower\\" piece, read more like filler material.  Eash story gets a short blurb of either introduction or post script, and there's the usual King introduction addressed to \\"you, Constant Reader.\\"<br />Overall, King deserves credit for continuing to write short stories at a time when the style has continued to decline.  As King points out in the introduction, while this collection is sure to be a bestseller like everything else he writes, it is also likely to be the only short story collection to make the list this year.  If he gets even a few people ineterested in short fictiona again, it will have been worthwhile.	2002-03-24

Alas, it is nothing of the sort.  It is instead a series of \\"essays\\" in which the author merely imagines what it would be like to drown, fall from a great height, suffer heat stroke or hypothermia, etc.  He liberally sprinkles each essay with medical data and historical anecdotes, but these hardly obscure the fact that there is no actual reporting going on here.  The chapter on scurvey, for example, is particularly ludicrous.  The author imagines a pleasure sailor who fears coming down with the disease because he forgot to pack any fruits or vegtables for a long distance voyage.  Say what???<br />There are dozens of excellent books out there that feature real life survival (and failure to survive) tales.  \\"Eiger Dreams\\" by John Krakauer is one of the best that immediately comes to mind.  Any of them would be preferable to this peculiar effort.	2002-03-15

Vise's \\"The Bureau and the Mole\\" is poorly written, poorly researched, gratuitous and just not well thought out.  It's a shame since a spy as good as Robert Hanssen deserves a better chronicler.  The first indictation that the book was rushed include a major factual error in the very first chapter (Vise refers to the \\"Daley Machine\\" in Chicago circa the late 1930s, even though the senior Daley was not elected Mayor until 1955).  The book then becomes a dual biography of Hannsen and FBI Director Loius Freeh, but because the narrative is a brief 229 pages, neither party gets more than a superficial telling of his life story.  The book also contains lengthy verbatim passeges of Hannsen's letters to the Soviets and his fantasy e-mails, which shorten the already inadequate narrative even more.  The e-mails are particularly offensive in that they detail Hannsen's perverted sexual fantasies about his wife to the point where the book starts to read like a degrading peep show.<br />In documenting Freeh's story, Vise relates every major FBI success and mistake during his tenure so that each get a scant few sentences of mention.  Another example of underreporting comes from the account of how Hannsen's brother-in-law reported his suspicions that Hannsen was spying in 1990 and the FBI dropped the ball.  Vise reports the fact, but apparently never attempted to find out WHY nothing was done.  Another poor decision was interviewing psychologists who never treated or even met Hanssen to get \\"psychological insight\\" into the man.  This ploy strikes me as less than worthless.  I should also mention that apperently no interviews were done with Hannsen's immediate family members for insight into how his spying impacted their lives.<br />Overall, this book is a shoddy rush job that never should have been released in its present condition...	2002-03-12

I've read them all, and unfortunately have to report that it is one of the lesser in the series.  That's a shame, because it feels like a key turning point in the the Walker saga.  Estleman brings back many of the memorable supporting characters from past novels (and in one case, the son of a supporting character) that really enhance the plot for any longtime fan.  The part with the former hooker Iris, who first appeared in the very first Walker novel, \\"Motor City Blue\\" is particularly poignant.  Walker also revisits the infamous Iroquois Heights, the corrupt town that has tromented him in previous novels (hence the title).<br />Unfortunately, the plot that all of this is in service of strains credibility to the breaking point.  It also goes over the top with the violence, a first in a Walker novel.  Estlemen uses the old \\"talking killer\\" ploy no less than THREE times, a key indicator of the weaknesses within with the story.<br />Overall, the Amos Walker series remains among the absolute best private dectective series currently ongoing.  But even an ace can take a bit of a stumble once in awhile.	2002-03-11

Author Loren Estleman proves himself to every bit as effective working in the short form as he is with his novels.  As the title implies, the stories mostly deal with death and murder, but they all come with a twist, most of them unforseemn and satisfying.  Walker is the most Phillip Marlowe-like P.I. walking the means streets today.  Any P.I. fan owes it to themselves to make his acquaintence.  At at brief 230 pages, this book is a quick delight.	2002-03-05

Instead it is primarily novel excerpts that are not in and of themselves self-contained stories.  What exactly is the point when you can buy &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; or &quot;The Lady in the Lake?&quot;  What do you need a four page excerpt for?  This collection is virtually worthless.	2002-03-01

Because it was edited by the great Lawrence Block, I expected it to contain a fair number of good hardboiled stories.  Alas, that is the one subgenre that gets the short shrift in this collection.  I noted that many of these stories first appeared in literary magazines, which may have something to do with why so many of them are written with flowery prose and are a tad shy on gritty street realism.  There is also a decided absence of big name mystery authors, with long time great Bill Pronzini being one of the few icons in the collection.  As soon as Pronzini's story, a first rate &quot;Nameless&quot; dectective tale, begins, the level of excitement rose for me.  Jerimiah Healy is also in this collection, but his Cuddy short story is fairly pedestrian.  Big name T. Jefferson Parker delivers &quot;Easy Street,&quot; which is among the best in the collection.  The others were a mixed bag for me, and I found some of them, like Roxanna Robinson's &quot;The Face Lift,&quot; to barely qualify as mystery stories.<br />Overall, this collection left me wondering.  If these really are the &quot;best&quot; mystery short stories being produced today, then the genre could definately use a good jump start.	2002-03-01

The book contains shorts from almost all of the major science fiction writers of the 20th Century (at least up until 1989, when it was published).  Some of the tales are among the best I've ever read,  like Phillip K. Dick's chilling military piece \\"Second Variety,\\" Kurt Vonnegot's angry satire \\"Harrison Bergeron,' Larry Niven's apocalyptic \\"Inconstant Moon\\" and Rene Rebetez-Cortes's evolutionary horror story \\"The New Prehistory.\\"  Others I didn't like so much, but some of that was a matter of taste not quality.<br />The book is not presented in any kind of recognizable order, but there is a brief introdutory blurb for each author.  I would recommend it with the caveat that most readers are likely to skip over some of the less appealing entries.	2002-02-27

At least two of them, Joe Haldeman's \\"Hero\\" and Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" were later expanded into full length novels.  Editor Harry Turtledove's \\"The Last Article\\" falls more into the \\"Alternate History\\" category (a volume of which he also recently edited), but the saga of Ghandi's attempt to free his native India from Nazi occupation is still quite compelling.  Superbly chilling is Phillip K. Dick's, \\"Second Variety,\\" and its scary post-apocalyptic battlefield.  One can see that this is where the idea for the \\"Terminator\\" movies came from.<br />The rest are more of a mixed bag.  Gregory Benford's \\"To the Storming Gulf\\" is a decent post nuclear war saga, while Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Superiority\\" is an excellent philisophical war story.  Some of the others are less compelling.  Anne McCaffrey's novella  \\"Dragonrider,\\" for example, takes up over 100 pages, and is more of a fantasy story than military science fiction.<br />Overall, this is a decent collection, worthwhile for fans of these types of stories.  I would recommend it with the caveat that you can skip over any of the tales that are not to your taste.	2002-02-21

To start with, there are a total of only 14 stories in the 415 pages of text.  Two of them, Ward Just's Civil War time travel saga \\"Bring the Jubilee\\" and Brad Linaweaver's Nazi nuclear victory space exploration story \\"Moon of Ice\\" take up close to half of the book.<br />The rest are a mixed bag.  Allen Steele's entertaining, \\"The Death of Captain Future\\" was my personal favorite, but it read like straight science fiction to me, I couldn't detect any \\"alternative history\\" in it.  Most of the others feature history changes that are trivial (Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"The Lucky Strike,\\" Susan Shwartz's \\"Suppose They Gave a Peace\\") or just not enough of a twist to be truly interesting.  My overall impression was that the stories in the book are just not as compelling as the many recent collections of speculative historical essays (the \\"What If\\" books, for example).	2002-02-09

The senseless brutality wrought upon the Muslim majority by the Serbs is well chronicled.  The Kosovo \\"ethnic clensing\\" effort lacked the systemic nature of the Nazi genocide or even the occasional grand scale of some of the atrocities committed in Bosnia, but it was no less horrific.  Albnaians had their homes burned and their villiages destroyed and many were shot as the Serbs attempted to drive them out.<br />Most of the action in the book takes place in and around the city of Pec, in eastern Kosovo.  It was among the hardest hit regions in the territory.  McAllester spent the three month war infiltrating Kosovo around in this region, though he never made to Pec until after the war because he would certainly have been killed by the Serbs.  Meanwhile in Pec, an ALbanian butcher named Isa Bala and his family tried to stay inconspicuous and wait out the killing.  Thier fate ultimately gives this story its gravity.<br />The only knock against the book is that for the most part it lacks a broader perspective.  The political events surrounding the war and the history that led to Kosovo's destruction get some mention, but not enough for the avearge reader.  Also, the larger war outside the Pec region gets only superficial coverage.  Nevertheless, this is still a disturbing account of modern genocide and of the banality of man's evil.	2002-02-07

A comprehensive work that encompasses nearly every published Block short story (over 70 of 'em!) it is a must have for mystery fans.  The book includes seven Matthew Scudder stories, nine Martin Ehrengraf stories, three Bernie Rhodenbarr stories and the complete texts of the three previous Block short story volumes.  As a bonus, there are five &quot;new&quot; Block stories, never before previously anthologized.<br />The stories run the gamut from hard-bitten to whodunnits? to even the occasional horror story.  Block shows every bit as much mastery with his short works that he does with his novels.  The diversity of his subjects and the bredth of his knowledge is simply breathtaking.  The book also includes a short prologue by the author, explaining how the book is laid out and giving a little helpful background.<br />Overall, &quot;The Collected Stories&quot; is a fine tribute to a great writer.	2002-02-02

Published in 1987 and containing 20 stories, it is heavily weighted toward the ten year period prior to its publication.  There are also a handful of stories from the 1950s and 60s, but none older than that.  Two of the best entries, &quot;The Used&quot; by Loren Estleman and &quot;A Cold Foggy Day&quot; by Bill Pronzini, kick things off.  (Note that neither of these stories contain either Amos Walker or the &quot;Nameless&quot; Detective).<br />After that strong start, things get more uneven.  For example, the Jim Thompson story that's included, &quot;The World, Then the Fireworks,&quot; is not one of his beeter efforts and doesn't make much sense.  Another story is about a rattlesnake attack and seems to have little to do with crime fiction.<br />Nevertheless, this is still a worthwhile collection.  Each story is preceeded by a short blurb about the author and the story itself (a MUST with these kinds of collections).  At just over 330 pages, it is a fine read for those who like their fiction hard-boiled.	2002-01-24

Containing 32 stories and nearly 600 pages of text, it is packed full of hard-boiled crimes taless, many of them superior in quality.  The best include, but are not limited to, &quot;A Candle for the Bag Lady,&quot; a fine early Matthew Scudder tale by Lawrence Block; &quot;So Dark for April,&quot; an excellent moody P.I. story by Howard Browne; &quot;Stacked Deck,&quot; a masterful caper tale by Bill Pronzini; &quot;We're All Dead,&quot; a heist-gone-wrong story by Bruno Fischer; plus a couple of good tales by the MacDonalds, Ross and John D.<br />On the downside, there are no author introductions for the individual stories to provide them context.  Nor are all of the stories first rate.  A couple of them veer into the supernatural, which doesn't seem to fit the theme.  They range in time period from the early 1930s to the mid-1990s but are not chronologically sequenced.  Nevertheless, as a reader you can certainly pick and choose, making this collection worthwhile for any fan of hard-boiled short crime fiction.	2002-01-23

One of its two editors, Bill Pronzini, is an avid collector of the old Pulp magazines as well as being one of the best hard-boiled writers working today (he's the author of the excellent &quot;Nameless&quot; detective series).  He and co-editor Jack Adrian really know their stuff, as they show with an extensive introduction that explains in detail the history of the genre.  They also provide good introductions for each individual writer, both the famous and the not-so famous, to give the reader a good perspective of where each author was coming from.<br />The stories themselves are grouped by the decade in which they were published.  The 1930s and 1950s are the most heavily represented because, the editors explain, they were the peak decades for hard-boiled fiction in terms of both poularity and quality.  The book covers the 1920s to the 1990s.<br />Overall, this is an excellent book for anyone who enjoys good crime stories.	2002-01-11

Unfortunately, it is all put into service of a story that is just not terribly compelling, particularly if it is meant to be the first in a series starring Sherwood.<br />The plot is fairly straightforward.  Sherwood is beaten up by a trio of street thugs when he attempts to stop them from attacking a runaway teenage girl.  No good deed goes unpunished, and while he's lying in the street the girl steals his Rolex watch, the only valuable thing he owns.  After cleaning himself up, Sherwood goes in search of the watch.  That premise doesn't exactly compell one to keep reading, and it was only Atwood's light and easy prose that kept me interested.<br />The case takes some unexpected turns when Sherwood discovers that the thugs are after the girl because they believe the girl stole a new designer drug from their boss, a wealthy eccentric dance club owner.  From there Sherwood encounters a trail of murder and deceit.  The New York street scenes are well described and the characters that inhabit them are fairly well drawn (except, curiously, for the girl, who the reader never really gets to know).  Unltimately, the story just doesn't amount to all that much, though there is one grisly scene in which two men fall out a high window that is quite shocking and shows that Atwood has potential as a storyteller.  He just needs more scenes like that one.<br />Overall, &quot;East of A&quot; is not a bad novel, just not a terribly memorable one.	2002-01-06

After two subpar Scudder efforts (&quot;Even the Wicked&quot; and &quot;Everybody Dies&quot;) that made one wonder if it wasn't time for the alcoholic P.I. to pack it in, he returns here as good as he has ever been.<br />To his credit, Block uses a literary device this time that's he's never used before in a Scudder novel, namely interspersing the usual first person narrative with a view through the eyes of the villian.  It could have backfired, but instead it succeeds brilliantly as Block creates one of the most chilling enemies that Scudder has ever faced.  The story involves the grizzly murder of a Manhattan socialite couple and the apparent murder -suicide of the perpetrators.  Scudder is turned on to the possibility that there is something more to it and begins scratching around.  Sure enough, before long more bodies start turning up, the victims of a criminal mastermind.<br />Block is a first rate crime writer who pulls no punches in his descriptions.  Scudder's contiuned growth as a character during the series is another plus, and its nice to see him back in his element.  &quot;Hope to Die&quot; leaves you waiting impatiently for the next Scudder novel.	2002-01-05

If the great gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson wrote detective novels, his would read a lot like Crumley's.  Alas, like Thompson, Crumley has lost a few miles-an-hour off his fastball as he's gotten older.  He writes at a glacial pace, and this is his first novel in over five years (since 1996's \\"Bordersnakes\\").<br />The hero this time out is Milo Milodragovich, appearing in his third novel since his memorable debut in \\"The Wrong Case.\\"  Milo has relocated from Montana to Texas and is semi-retired on a small fortune he \\"stole\\" in \\"Bordersnakes.\\"  He can't stay away from the deteective game, however, and ends up with two interrelated cases, neither of which are good for his health.  The story features a myriad of characters (over two dozen, I would guess) and meanders like a river across the Texas plain.  The scenery is colorful, and the dialog is snappy, but the story is confused, and leads to a less than completely plausible ending.  Additionally, the chief villian is only on stage for a total of about a half a dozen or so pages, and is not developed enough as a character to make the first of two climax scenes resonate.<br />Overall, \\"The Final Country\\" is not a bad novel.  Crumley is a better writer than 99% of the mytery authors working today, and is still capable of creating vividly memorable scenes. Unfortunately, there are just not enough of them here to give this novel an unqualified recommendation.	2002-01-03

That is most decidedly NOT the case with &quot;The Lost Continent,&quot; in which Bryson heaps out much his trademark satire and humor which is at times decidely not good-natured.<br />The book takes Bryon on an automobile journey across America and back, mostly through small towns and historical sights.  He brings an intersting perspective in that he had spent the previous decade living in Great Britain, and this journey helped reacquaint him with America.  In this, he is a perfect commentator, combining his native Midwestern sensibilities with an adult perspective in which much of what he sees he does not expect because of his long absence from his native soil.<br />Throughout the book, Bryson make references to his father and the family trips taken across the U.S. when he was a child.  In this, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is a very personal work for him.  He dedicated the book to his late father and even though dad is a constance source of (very funny) satire, it also manages to be quite touching.<br />Overall, this is an excellent work from a first rate travel writer and humorist.  But if you don't like an edge to your humor, you should probably pass.	2001-12-22

Haldeman knows how to spin a good tale, much like Stephen King with his short stories.  Haldeman's usually come from a science fiction angle, and he's one of that genre's more grounded authors, including here a war analogy story based upon his own experiences in Vietnam (&quot;A Mind of His Own&quot;).<br />Some of the other better stories in this collection include &quot;The Mazel Tov Revolution,&quot; an example of Jewish science fiction; &quot;All the Universe in a Mason Jar&quot; a humorous story about aliens and moonshine; &quot;26 Days, On Earth,&quot; a fine coming of age story; and &quot;Summer's Lease,&quot; a poiniant philosophical story.<br />Overall, any lover of science fiction should love this collection.	2001-12-08

The book chronicles the abuses and the successes (yes, there were a few, particularly where the economy was concerned) of one of Latin America's more notorious dictators.  Pinochet's reign could be described as the banality of evil.  There was considerable political repression, and hundreds of Chileans lost their lives, but his was a rule more by ham-handed thuggery than systematic destruction like the Nazis.  In the end, Pinochet was brought down not by revolution, but by his own ineptness.<br />The authors do a good job in providing the historical context for their story.  They show both how Chile had a strong tradition of democracy before Pinochet, and how the excesses of his Socialist predecessor Allende helped lead to the coup that brought him to power.  The authors also debunk the notion that the U.S. was behind the coup, though they acknowledge that the Nixon administration and the CIA did everything they could to politically undermine Allende before the coup.<br />The book is broken down into sections covering various aspects of Chilean society, rather than chronologically.  The last chapter deals with the events that led to Pinochet's electoral downfall, and the relatively peaceful return to democracy in Chile.  If the book has a drawback, it is that it was published in 1991, and therefore lacks a chapter on post-Pinochet Chile.<br />Overall, this is an excellent book for anyone interested in world history or politics.	2001-12-03

First, that we are becoming an increasingly scientifically illeterate society, and second, that our ignorance of science is a threat not only to the security of our future, but to the freedoms we all enjoy.  Sagan spends much of the book debunking so-called psuedo-science (alien abductions, psycotherapy, astrology, etc).  He also makes the point that America is doing a very poor job educating its young about the wonders of science.  Sagan also castigates the media for not exercising more scepticism in scientific reporting, and, indeed, mostly ignoring hard science altogether.<br />The book itself is a bit disjointed, with several chapters deriving from expanded magazine articles.  Additionally, Sagan pontificates about political issues, and reveals a leftist political bent.  He also has a tendancy at times to overemphasize his point.  Nevertheless, he has some important points to make, and as a society we would be better off if we paid close attention to many of the issues he raises.	2001-11-27

Indeed, it has the right elements; shady underworld characters, a heartlss neighborhood, and and good amount of violence.  Neverheless, it feels like a novel written by someone who has spent their life outside looking in at the world of crime.  This novel, while interesting and with enough compelling characers to pull it along, never quite feels authentic.  Despite its attempt t be street hip, it is actully quite conventional.<br />Would I recommend this novel?  I suppose I would to anyone who likes a good crime story.  It is moderately ententaining, but not all that memorable.	2001-11-25

Some of the problem may be that Norman died before &quot;Young Men&quot; was completed despite having spent nearly eight years on it.  Norman Maclean writes is a flowery literary style, which may have been appropriate for his &quot;A River Runs Through It,&quot; but is distracting in a work of non-fiction.  Additionally, only the first third of the book is about the fire itself.  The remainder focusses on the attempts by Norman Maclean and others to determine how the disaster happened, and quite frankly it is just not interesting enough to justify 200 pages of text.<br />&quot;Young Men and Fire&quot; is not a bad book for those interested in the subject matter.  But as a work of journalism, it is lacking.	2001-11-07

Not so Loren Estlemen's Amos Walker P.I. series.  If anything, Estlemen and his hero are getting better.  &quot;A Smile of the Face of the Tiger&quot; is the fourth Walker book since Estlemen took a seven year hiatus from his favorite shamus, and it is easily the best of the &quot;comeback&quot; novels.  Walker remains one of the few who truly does carry on the torch of Phillip Marlowe with his lonliness, cynicism and uncorruptible nature.<br />This time out, he tracks a old pulp fiction writer who has disappeared after turning down an advance to reprint one of his old novels.  I've seen this story line several times before, but Estlemen gets clever with it.  Along the way, he weaves in his usual menacing mobster (a Sammy &quot;the Bull&quot; Gravano clone, no less) and corrupt police officer angles, also in a fresh and unique way.  It also helps that Estlemen puts two of the series's better supporting characters, police Lieutenant Mary Ann Thaler and beguiling publisher's representative Louise Starr, to good use this time out.  As always, the real hero of the story is the once great city of Detroit, still struggling to regain some of its lost luster, this time with casino gambling.<br />Overall, Walker is among the best private detectives in the literary world today, and this is one of his best novels to date.	2001-11-06

Now the negative: it is also not terribly insightful for anyone who knows a lot about history.  If you already know the story of events such as the Irish potato famine, the retreats of Napoleon and Hitler in the face of the Russian winter, or of the massive Pacific storm that savaged Admiral Bull Halsey's fleet in December 1944, then you aren't going to learn anything new.  For a book allegedly about the weather, Durschimed spends so much time giving general background information that the weather itself gets the short shrift in his narratives.  He could just as easily have called the book a collection of random historical essays, which is essentially what it is.<br />The two most bizzare chapters come at the end.  One tells of his own personal experience as a war corrrespondant in the Mekon Delta, like the revelation that jungle conditions hampered American war efforts in Vietnam is a something new.  The other is his essay on possible future attempts to use weather control devices as military weapons.  This is an intriguing notion, but anyone who knows anything about science will realize that the technology for such a possibility will never be had, if at all, by 2025, which is the random date picked by the author for the title of the chapter.<br />Overall, &quot;The Weather Factor&quot; is not a bad book, but people with a real interest in weather as well as history buffs will likely be disappointed.	2001-11-01

This section, however, is only one chapter in a book that is a collection of diverse stories ranging from reportage on Western U.S. wildfires to the battlefields of Kosovo and Sierra Leonne.  Junger is a good reporter and an excellent writer who knows how to make his stories come alive for the reader.  He originally conceived a book in which he would report on the most dangerous jobs in the world, hence the first two chapters on Western firefighters and the third on a traditional whale hunter.  Junger then discovered he had a knack as a foreign correspondent and ventured into some of the world's war zones.  With all of his stories, Junger provides valuable insight for the reader, especially in his reporting on the long standing division of Cyprus, which he co-authored with another journalist.<br />The only drawback is that Junger's pieces are the original magazine articles and are not expanded upon for the book.  The focus of each article also tends to be very narrow, especially in the foreign pieces.  Junger lacks the depth of master correspondent like Thomas Friedman, and the book is fairly slight at just over 220 pages.  Nevertheless, he is a skilled writer, and this makes for excellent and informative reading.	2001-11-01

It does not attempt to be a comprehensive list of such disasters.  As such, it is a cut above the usual for these kind of books.  Author Robert Belyk is a historian, and though his prose it a bit dry at times, he delivers the goods with first hand accounts from the survivors and overall descriptions of the disasters.  He also includes a little background of each story as well as the aftermath.  This book will be much appreciated by anyone who enjoys a good maritime disaster tale.	2001-10-26

Amos Walker would occasionally mention the death of his former partner and mentor, who was killed during a stakeout of an adulterous husband.  But not until &quot;The Hours of the Virgin,&quot; do we find out just how much that tragic event affected him.  Walker is investigating a case involving a missing fifteenth century manuscript when he is double crossed and disciovers that his partner's murderer is involved.  Along the way, Walker learns much about his partner's death, and life, that he never knew.  All of this leads to a satisfying climax in which Walker finally confronts some of his own inner demons.<br />Estlemen's Walker P.I. series is one of the best currently going.  Unlike a lot of the fluff that passes for hard boiled detective novels these days, Walker is the real deal.  All of his novels have the kind of downcast loneliness that is vital to the genre.  The spirit of Phillip Marlowe lives on in Amos Walker.	2001-10-20

Another lengthy item is &quot;You Can Never Go Back,&quot; which was originally intended to be the middle portion of Haldeman's best novel &quot;The Forever War,&quot; and was actually included in later versions of that book.  The best of the shorter stories include &quot;More Than the Sum of His Parts,&quot; a graphic outer space horror story, the humorous &quot;A !Tangled Web,&quot; an excellent historical story &quot;Manifest Destiny,&quot; as well as several poems by the author.  This work is nearly as good as Stephen King's short story collections.  Any sci-fi fan or lover of a good tale should enjoy it.	2001-10-18

That's what makes Alexa Albert's book, &quot;Brothel&quot; so valuable. Despite her queasiness with the subject matter, Albert has managed to write a well balanced book that frankly portrays the pros and cons of legalized prostitution. There are a lot of surprises in the book, not the least of which is that nuances of the personalities of the working girls themselves. They do not all come from poor backgrounds, nor are they all victims of prior sexual abuse. They do not all have drug problems, nor are they all subservient to men. In short, their backgrounds are as varied as their stories.<br />Having said that, Albert's book is not for everyone. It is at times very sexually frank and contains some scenes that are not for the squeamish. I also found the passages where Albert worries about what her family will think of her research to be distracting and not relevant. It is enough for Albert to say that her feelings about what she witnesses are conflicted. This is a difficult subject, and this book should be read by both those who believe (as I do) that prostitution ought to be legalized on a wider basis and by those who would seek to try and eradicate it. Whatever your position, this book is guaranteed to surprise you.	2001-10-17

That wouldn't be so bad, except that the story lags, leading to an ending that is less than satisfying.<br />Vachss is among the best modern mystery writers.  He uses very spare prose and cutting dialog befitting of the violent underworld that Burke inhabits.  Vachss understands the criminal mind better than any other writer in the genre.  Unfortunately, he is also getting way too preachy.  This time, he takes on the drug war and how it is responsible for the suffering of critically and terminally ill patients by denying them adequate pain relief.  But even if you agree with Vachss (as I do) the soapbox bit gets tiring.  Even Vachss's usual issue, child abuse, is not used effectively this time around.  The motivation of the missing teenager that Burke is searching for when finally revealed seems implausible and somewhat trite.<br />Overall, this Burke novel ranks among the worst of the series.  That still doesn't mean its bad, just that it leaves you wishing it had been better.	2001-10-09

The convoluted plot has Tanner spending time investigating a woman's disappearance in the sleazy Bay town of El Gordo on behalf of the local district attorney.  The woman is a witness against the town's leading mob figure.  The story has a good level of violence, and takes plenty of twists and turns, but unfortunately becomes a bit too complex for its own good.  Tanner makes a good P.I.  He's fearless, tough talking, lonely and just a touch cynical.  He's just not given first rate material to work with during this particular outing.  If you are new to the Tanner series, I'd recommend &quot;Grave Erros,&quot; or &quot;Past Tense&quot; instead.	2001-09-20

As such, the book delivers the goods and is a fairly straightforward retelling of the life of &quot;The Best Columnist of His Generation.&quot;  That said, if you're not a fan, there isn't much here that would compell you to read this book.  The author interviewed a lot of Royko's friends and associates, and the portrayal that comes across is one of a hardworking, fair-minded, alcoholic columnist from the old school of two-fisted journalism who had an uncanny ability to find the right tone in the over 8,000 columns that he wrote.<br />Unfortunately, the book doesn't really manage to get inside Royko's head, other than to show the obvious.  He was a product of his relatively poor, urban ethnic upbringing, and he had insecurities that continued to plague him despite his massive success.  He loathed racism in the 1960s, but also came to loathe political correctness in the 1990s.  He blasted the senior Mayor Daley at every turn, but came to support his son despite having compared him to one of the three stooges.  All of this Ciccone dutifully recounts, as well as Royko's troubled private life and prickly relationship with his professional colleagues.<br />Overall, this book benefits from having Mike Royko as its subject, but ultimately it does not transcend him.	2001-09-20

Based upon the true story as told by the film's main character, Henry Hill, &quot;Goodfellas is the best filmed example of the real life glamour and woekmanlike drudgery that goes with being a wiseguy.  It is difficult to imagine a show like &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; for example, had not &quot;Goodfellas&quot; reinvented the gangster film genre.<br />Ray Liotta is excellent as Henry, but the movie's real showcases are the performances of Joe Pesci and Robert DiNiro as his partners in crime.  Pesci in particular gives a tour de force performance that is downright frightening.  Other first rate performances come from Lorraine Bracco as Henry's Jewish wife and Paul Sorvino, whose performance as a real life Godfather could not be more different than Marlon Brando's.<br />This film is a must see for anyone who enjoys gangster movies.  It also has to rank as THE best American movie of the 1990s.	2001-09-08

The book chronicles the rise and fall of the Irish gang of the same name that was every bit as bloodthirsty as John Gotti's more famous crew.  The gang occupied New York City's since regentrified Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.  Mystery author Lawrence Block effectively used the Westies lore in creating the character Mickey Ballou in the Matthew Scudder private detective series.  The fictional Ballou could be Jimmy Coonan or Mickey Featherstone, the real life chieftans of the gang, who were known for dismembering victims and dumping their bodies in the East River.<br />&quot;The Westies&quot; is a brutally violent story and one that makes good reading for anyone who likes real life organized crime stories.  The prose and the reporting are a cut above average for this type of book.	2001-09-03

As the book opens, Nameless is still recovering psycologically from the events of the previous book, &quot;Shackles,&quot; (the best of the series) in which he was chained and left to die in a mountain cabin. This time out, he investigates the suicide of a young woman's brother that came on the heels of the brother winning and losing a huge fortune in a casino. Of course, Nameless's investigation proves there was a lot more to the story. Much of the action takes place in Nevada, which is a refrsehing change of scenery from Nameless's native San Francisco. The plot moves along quickly and reaches a satisfying conclusion, except for one flaw. The scene in which Nameless confronts a big time mobster simply doesn't ring plausible. Otherwise, it is a fine entry in this always dependable series.	2001-08-28

It delves into subject matter that includes a dying multi-millionaire searching for his estranged son, and the dying embers of 1960s radicalism in the early 1980s. Throw in a subpolt about a missing hotshot investigative reporter and a disillusioned physician, and things get complicated enough. The story's main problem is that the 60s radical angle doesn't come off that well. James Crumley did a much better job examining that theme in &quot;The Last Good Kiss&quot; and &quot;The Wrong Case.&quot; And the ending is not the most plausible that Greenleaf has ever come up with. Overall, the Tanner series is a good one, but this is not one of the better entries.	2001-08-25

Change the setting from the North Atlantic to the Gulf of Alaska, and it is &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; all over again. There have been a lot of books that have attempted to follow the massive success of Sebastian Junger's bestseller. In the case of &quot;Coming Back Alive,&quot; the story itself has its interesting aspects, but author Spike Walker lacks Junger's deft storytelling touch. The book tries to paint a backdrop of life in the fishing villages in Southeastern Alaska, but manages to do so somewhat incompletely. The snapshots of living in this vast wilderness are interesting but disjointed, and this portion of the book meanders. Walker throws in a couple of other dramtic Coast Gueard rescue missions, including one that ended tragically, but since those missions happened many years before the main story, they seem a little misplaced. And unlike the recently published, &quot;The Rescue Season,&quot; which is about Alsaka Mountain rescue crews, this book doesn't do as good a job at getting into the psyche pf those who risk their lives in such a dramatic style helping others. Overall, Walker's book is not bad reading for those with a particular interest in the subject matter. But don't expect another perfect storm story.	2001-08-25

Alas, &quot;Disatser&quot; makes a similar attempt in the storytelling department but fails.  The book contains plenty of facts and first hand accounts of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, but it is strangely disjointed.  There are so many stories of numerous survivors interwoven together that individually they are hard to follow.  And since the book checks in at a fairly brief 256 pages of text, each snippet of each story usually gets only a couple of paragraphs before moving on.  Together, the stories blend into a rather shapeless mass that all start to sound alike.  Kurzman would have been better served to tell his story from the larger perspective and using individual stories where they fit in.  This approach served David McCullough extremely well in his excellnt &quot;The Johnstown Flood,&quot; which serves as the ideal model for this type of book.<br />Overall, if you are interested in the subject matter or are a disaster buff, this book should be worthwhile with the above caveats.  If you are a casual reader, you may want to consider taking a pass on this one.	2001-08-17

Loren Estleman has all the moves down by this time for Walker, and &quot;The Witchfinder&quot; is typical of the series.  Walker has run-ins with the cops, gets mixed up in a homicide investigation, and comes up against an assortment of low lifes and homicidal killers, your typical day at the office.  He's hired by a dying millionaire archetect to find out who &quot;framed&quot; the love of his life eight years ago and caused him to break off their relationship.  The story takes an appropriate number of twists and turns, and as usual Walker remains uncorruptable throughout.<br />Though not among the best of the Walker series (that would be &quot;Sugartown,&quot; or &quot;The Glass Highway&quot;), it is still a solid effort from one of the best P.I.s since Phillip Marlowe.	2001-08-16

I've never read a short story anthology by any other author to match his &quot;Night Shift,&quot; or &quot;Skelton Crew&quot; collections.  But Lawrence Block comes close with &quot;Sometimes They Bite.&quot;  Block may be a crime writer, but some of his stories, like the excellent title story, read similar to King's horror work, especially his non-supernatural horror work.  Private Detective Matthew Scudder makes one fine appearance in this collection, as does Bernie Rhodenbarr of Block's &quot;Burglar&quot; series.  The rest are a hodgepodge of stories told from the point of view of victims, perpetrators and cops.  Some work better than others, of course, but there isn't a dud in the lot.<br />Fans of Lawrence Block should check out this book for a different view of an author who normally produces great novels.	2001-08-16

The subtitle states that the book is &quot;A History of the Polar Regions,&quot; a pretty hefty task, especially for a book that clocks in at a mere 245 pages of text.  Of course, it is not a comprehensive, or even a very complete history.  Instead, the book is really a essay on the environmental damage man's presence has caused in both the Arctic and Anarctic.  Stories of famous explorers like Admundsen, Scott, Cook, Peary and the like get mentions ranging from a couple of sentences to a few paragraphs.  The majority of the book concerns such subjects as whaling, seal hunting, oil exploration, the effects of civilization on eskimos and so forth.<br />Were the book as well written and as focussed and balanced as recent environmental tomes such as &quot;Oceans End&quot; and &quot;Earth Odyssey,&quot; it would still be a worthwhile read.  Instead, Mulvaney spends most of his time regurgitating facts and statistics until they become numbing.  His leftist environmental stance is also hard to take by anyone who doesn't share his zealous views.  He comes off as the kind of environmentalist who would rather see human civilization collapse than have it do anything to further exploit natural resources.  In the end, I suspect that his book will have little impact, as he will find himself preaching only to the already committed.	2001-08-12
1888272:US	51809405	R1XHSJN6ZPYXX0	0380725355	997279820	Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder)	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Not Everybody Died	&quot;Everybody Dies&quot; represents author Lawrence Block's attempt to reintroduce the edge that the great private detective Matthew Scudder lost in the previous novel, &quot;Even the Wicked.&quot;  In &quot;Wicked,&quot; Scudder turned into super-sleuth, solving three high profile cases while never coming remotely close to courting physical danger.  The result was the weakest novel of the 14 (and counting) in the series.  &quot;Everybody Dies&quot; tries to be different.  Right off the bat, Scudder is viscously attacked on the street, his AA sponser is killed by a hired gunman who mistakes him for Scudder, and his gangster buddy Mick Ballou's bar is firebombed, which kills a dozen people including Scudder's former mistress.  The rest of the novel concerns Scudder and Ballou's search for those responsible in order to take revenge.<br />All of this sounds exciting, and yet it is curiously rather sterile.  In the best Scudder books, the threat is always lurking in the background, including the threat that Scudder might fall off the wagon.  Here it seems over the top and not particularly plausible.  The leading badguy seems as if he'd be incapable of being organized enough to take on Ballou the way he does and the climatic battle has surprisingly little tension.  One problem, I think, is that Scudder has become far too domesticated with his stable marriage and stable life.  As a character, he needs to return to the edge.  Otherwise his stories will continue to be safe and predictable, rather than daring like the best of the series, no matter how many minor characters Block kills off in the process.	2001-08-07

He doesn't work the streets of Detroit so much as he INHABITS them.  &quot;Never Street&quot; is longer and more complex than any Walker story up until that time as Amos tries to find a missing video producer and noir film buff who appears to be acting out his fantasy of sisappearing into one of his movies.  For any fan of classic film noir, this is a MUST read.  As a mystery, it reads reasonably well, although is not nearly as good as the best of the Walker series (novels such as &quot;Sugartown&quot; and &quot;The Glass Highway&quot;).  Walker novels suffer a bit from too little reliance on supporting characters.  Reappearing cops John Alderdyce and Mary Ann Thaler make a brief turn here, but only in the background of the story.  Walker does have a rare romance this time out, and that helps give the story a bit of a lift.<br />Overall, fans of Amos Walker should enjoy this entry in the series.  His is a welcome return.	2001-08-05

Unfortunately, &quot;Even the Wicked&quot; is easilly the least enjoyable of the bunch.  Author Lawrence Block deserves credit for allowing Scudder's character to grow and mature over the years; going from down-and-out alcoholic to struggling AA member to reasonably stable married man while still maintaining an edge.  At least, he had until &quot;Wicked.&quot;  The three interwoven storylines are pure New York City (more so, in fact, than any past entry in the series).  But they have absolutely no edge to them.  At no time does Scudder seem remotely in physical danger.  Instead, he turns into super-sleath, solving high profile cases that are baffling entire police departments.  Also, his relationship with Elaine, who he is now married to, has grown stale.<br />Maybe Block sensed these problems and that is why he attempted to give the next (and currently most recent) entry in the series, &quot;Everybody Dies,&quot; much more of an edge.  If you are not familiar with how great Scudder can be, I implore to to start elsewhere in the series.  The best two are arguably, &quot;Eight Million Ways to Die,&quot; and &quot;When the Sacred Ginmill Closes.&quot;	2001-08-04

As such it's a good effort.  I am a huge fan of private detective novels and this was my first Cuddy effort.  I would rank it in the middle of the pack among such novels.  It has some elements that make these novels great.  The hero is world weary and lonely, having recently lost his wife.  The story has some good hardboiled elements and the ending takes shome shocking turns.  On the downside is Healy's use of two overused elements, The Rich Family with Dark Secrets, and The Corrupt Small Town Police Force.  Quite frankly, a lot of private detective writers seem tohave a pathological dislike for rich people and small town cops.  Overall, this isn't a bad start to the series, but here's hoping that later stories are more intersting.	2001-07-07

I am a huge fan of private detective fiction and on that basis alone I gave it a read.  Maybe it was the hype, but I was somewhat disappointed.  The novel starts out well, former Detroit cop Alex McKnight has retired to the bleak shores of Lake Superior after having received a bullet in the chest.  The cold landscape of Northern Michigan in the late fall is a perfect backdrop for a good hard-edged story.  Alas, it fails to materialize.<br />The plot is strangely oblique and uses the old device of a killer out of the hero's past.  It works well for a while, but ultimately stretches plausibility.  The book also doesn't make as good a use of its setting as it could.  McKnight never explains why he chose to live where he does (other than a tenuous family tie) and the events of the book have no unique local flavor to them.  But the novel's biggest flaw is the presence of two characters.  One is the local Chief of Police, who takes an absurd pathological dislike to McKnight for no particular reason that I could discern.  The other is the character of a missing man's wife with whom McKnight had an affair.  Her nastiness also seems contrived and their relationship, after taking an implausible turn, is left bizarrely unresolved at the end of the book.<br />Overall, author Steve Hamilton has some of the moves to be a great private detective fiction writer.  But he's nowhere near there yet, awards not withstanding.	2001-07-03

The story is one of shady deals, sleazy politicians and outright bribery.  Edwards was just one of many crooked characters who put their own interests ahead of the state's.  As a result, New Orleans received a white elephant land casino, the Mississippi River and other Louisiana waterways got riverboat casinos that never leave the docks and every bar, gas station and truck stop got a video poker machine.  This was supposed to help cure the state's financial woes, but it instead led to a spate of corruption and a whole host of social ills.<br />All of this sounds interesting and it is to a point.  The problem with the book is that it is TOO comprensive to be a truly good read.  Bridges spends a couple of hundred pages painstakingly recounting every aspect of the dealmaking that took place, far more than will hold the attention of most readers.  Only in the book's last hundred pages does he finally get to the Edward DeBartolo riverboat deal which was ultimately Governor Edwards' downfall.  Bridges provides a good perspective of the state's long history with gambling, but his insistance of recounting the entire life history of just about every player slows his story down.  Interestingly, he give the least amount of space to his least compelling argument; that of the people who become addicted to gambling.  He recounts the stories of a few working class and middle class people who blew their life savings either on the poker machines or in the casinos.  He lets stand without comment one woman's ridiculous assertion that state of Louisina is to blame for her losing $100,000 on $2 video poker bets.  Excuse me lady, but no one put a gun to your head and forced you to make those bets.<br />Overall, &quot;Bad Bet on the Bayou&quot; is a story that needed to be told as a warning to other municipalities enamored with the potential financial windfall of legalized gambling.  Unfortunately, the book's narrative is not as good as its subject.Bayou&quot; is a story that needed to be told as a warning to other municipalities enamored with the potential financial windfall of legalized gambling.

Superficially, the novel is about Scudder's attempt to prove that a deranged homeless man did not randomly gun down a successful lawyer.  But actually, the novel is a dissertation about death and the choices one makes in life.  During his investigation, Scudder's ex-girlfriend Jan Keane discloses to him that she has terminal cancer and asks him to procure a gun so that she can end her life before the pain consumes her.  Meanwhile, Scudder and his current love, the former call girl Elaine Mardell, are moving closer together, even as Scudder becomes more restless and Elaine begins to question the direction of her own life.  To top it off, Scudder's restlessness causes him to begin an affair with the dead lawyer's wife that he is ashamed of but unable to stop.  This causes him to question whether he will be able to continue his sobriety despite over ten successful years in AA.<br />All of this accompanies a mystery that is interesting in and of itself, but not nearly as menacing as most Scudder mysteries.  The recurring charater of the street kid TJ also shows some progression in his life during the story while assisting Scudder's investigation.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this novel as the place to start reading Scudder since to truly enjoy it requires a lot of the previous background of the characters.  But for those who already know how good the Scudder novels are it is a must read.	2001-06-30

The first scene of &quot;Vampire$&quot; starts out scary, but decends into gratuitous violence.  From there, the novel stalls, spending over a hundred pages on uneffective character deveolpment.  The mood is all wrong.  If vampires WERE real and stalking the earth, one would think that governments would have more urgency about destroying them and that those who do the job would be a little more organized.  I also found the religous aspect of the story baffling.  Quite frankly, the whole novel lost comprehension for me well before the halfway mark.  I would love to see it rewritten by someone who is able to give its great concept true justice.	2001-06-28

Tanner is neither as quick with his wits as Phillip Marlowe nor as eccentric as Matthew Scudder, but this novel contains the kind of hard boiled elements both would be comfortable with.  When an old friend and fellow detective is murdered while investigating a case, Tanner drops his own case only to find that the two are somehow connected.  Ultimately, the story becomes an elaborate whodunnit with plenty of twists and turns along the way.  They violence is fast and ferocious and the mood is appropriately somber.  If there is a drawback, its that because the plot is so thick, Tanner's personality is not as well defined as it should be.  Nevertheless, as P.I. novels go, this entry is very worthwhile.	2001-06-27

She inadvertantly ensnares her ex into one of his better cases.  Involving an ex-movie starlet, an inept fellow p.i., two shady CIA operatives and a tough but honest cop, this one has all the elements of a great Walker novel.  But its the personal touch of Amos dealing with his ex that makes this novel one of the better in the series.  Checking in at a very brief 193 pages in small hardback form, it manages to contain plenty of excitement while giving a long overdue glimpse into Walker's psyche.  Though not quite as good as &quot;Sugartown,&quot; or &quot;The Glass Highway,&quot; (the best of the series), for fans of this great long running series, this entry is top notch.  For beginners, its a good place to start.	2001-06-26

Novels like &quot;Sugartown&quot; and &quot;The Glass Highway&quot; are among the best P.I. novels ever.  With &quot;Silent Thunder,&quot; Walker stays true to form.  He's as quick with his guns and hit wit as ever.  He continues to run into dangeorus thugs and corrupt policemen.  And he remains as uncorruptable as ever.  In this installment, Walker takes on some crazy gun dealers and a powerful businessman on behalf of a client who's about to go on trial for murdering her husband.  Its the type of case that Walker specializes in, helping the little person in a battle against the larger forces trying to extinguish them.  Unfortunately in this book, Estleman allows plausibility to get taken for a ride.  He stretches both the corrupt cop and the crazy gun nut angles way too far.  Not to mention the fact that this is the first Walker novel in which the hero begins to seem a bit stale.  Estleman has not allowed Walker to grow as a character the way Lawrence Block has with Matthew Scudder or Andrew Vachss has with his Burke charcter.  And by this, the ninth novel in the series, Walker is beginning to get a little tired.  Perhaps that is why Estleman took a seven year break from writing Walker adventures after the novel that follows this one.  Overall, Walker novels are never bad but they are usually better than this.	2001-06-23

In &quot;Tombstones,&quot; a drug dealer whose wife was kidnapped and hideously murdered hires Scudder to track down the perpetrators.  Scudder quickly discovers that the deed was the work of a team of serial killers who have decided to turn their &quot;fun&quot; into profit.  Like most novels in the Scudder series, this one is dark and obssessed with death.  It seems that even as the alcoholic Scudder gets more of a firm handle on his sobriety and his life, his cases get uglier.  Recurring characters in this novel are the street kid T.J., the police detective Joe Durkin, the eccentric informant Danny Boy Bell and call girl Elaine Mardell, who has become the love of Scudder's life.  In fact, &quot;Tombstone&quot; features a key moment in Scudder's developing relationship with Elaine.<br />Overall, this is not the best novel in the Scudder series, but it is still well written and highly satisifying.	2001-06-23

Peter Nichols's &quot;A Voyage for Madmen&quot; is one of the better ones.  Given that solo sailing circumnavigations are a yearly ritual today, we tend to forget that as recently as a generation ago it was practically unheard of.  In 1968, nine sailors, mostly independently of one another, decided to try and become the first to sail around the world alone without stopping.  This was in an era before satelite weather radar or advanced communication equipment.  Basically, for their whole voyage, the competitors faced the ravages of the sea alone.  The feat became a contest to see who could finish first and who could finish the fastest.  That seperate distinction became moot, when only one sailor was able to complete the journey.<br />Nichols expertly introduces each of the competetors and describes the unbelievable difficulties they faced.  An ardent sailor himself, he writes with much authority, but with also much drama.  The only drawback is that at times he is too technical for the non-sailor to follow, but thies hardly dulls the book's excitement.  In fact if you go in unfamiliar (as I was) with the actual event, this book reads like a novel with surprise twists and turns along the way.  And the eventual winner of the race is the type of hero, though we may question his sanity, that anyone can admire.<br />Overall, this a great book for sailing enthusiasts that can also be enjoyed by anyone else who like a good nautical story.	2001-06-18

His Adams book is meticuously reasearched and yet very readible.  This is historical writing at its very best in that it makes its subject come alive for the reader.<br />And his subject is a man who, while certainly not forgotten, has not received his just due as a leader of the American Revolution.  While Washington was a unifying symbol and Jefferson and Hamilton were great (if flawed) visionaries, Adams was a practical man of great devotion whose contributions to this nation were every bit as important.  While Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, it was Adams whose forceful personality pushed it through the Continental Congress.  Later on, as a Diplomat during the Revolution, Adams helped secure France's assistance, helped secure much needed financing from the Dutch and helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris that ended the war on terms much more favorable to America than the military situation warranted.<br />Adams went on to define the role of the Vice President as the first holder of that office.  Then, facing the unenviable task of succeeding the mythical Washington as President, his biggest contribution was to steadfastly maintain peace with France.  Thereby he not only avoided a potentially destructive war, he checked the rampant militarism of Hamilton and established the diplomatic climate that made possible the Louisiana Purchase three years later.  His narrow defeat for reelection three years later represents the first peacible transfer of power in modern democratic times.<br />McCullough tells of this with a master storyteller's eye.  He uses Adams's own correspondence ands that of his extraordinary wife Abigal to good effect.  He also portrays Adams's long and peculiar friendship with Jefferson, show how their lives were uniquely intertwined.  This is a monumental book which in absence of real monument to Adams will have serve as a literary substitute.s will have serve as a literary substitute.	2001-06-18

Berendt, like Jon Krakauer in &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time when an extraordinary series of events occurred.  In this case, he had already come to know Savannah socialite Jim Williams and had met Williams rambunctous young housemate shortly before Williams shout the younger man under mysterious circumstances.  Williams was tried no less than FOUR times for the killing.  He was convicted the first three, but each conviction was overturned on a technicality.<br />All of this plays out against a backdrop as colorful as any that has been created in fiction.  Berendt encounters a plethora of eccentric Savannah characters including a deadbeat lawyer, a black drag queen, a somewhat unstable government scientist and a host of others that could only exist in a society as strange as that of the city they inhabit.  Berendt readilly admits that there are embellishments and that the book is not intended to be a journalistic account.  This is fine, because what he has written is an entertaining masterpiece that proves once again that truth really is stranger than fiction.	2001-06-18

Instead of just being a glorified fanzine, it is put together in a style that makes it both compelling and enlightening for even the most ardent fan.  The book is written as if the author has put together a real life FBI dossier on New Jersey's leading crime family.  Included are artifacts and ancedotes that supposedly provide insight to the agents who are trying to bring down Tony and the boys.  It is a clever and amusing way to provide fans of the series with detailed background and insight into the show's myriad of characters.  But not to fear, it also provides an episode by episode recap of every show from the first two seasons (hence its one drawback, it covers ONLY the first two seasons).  Oddities abound, such as a nursing home report on Livia and a discarded credit card bill showing a month's worth of Meadow's purchases.  In fact, were it the real thing, the author's obsession with both of Tony's &quot;families&quot; would be downright creepy.  This is the kind of stuff you would expect a stalker to have in his possession.  Overall, a worthwhile book for fans, but not the sort of thing you would give to someone who hasn't already been initiated.	2001-06-15

Fiction series out there.  He is one of the few that can be compared with the great Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe.  And &quot;Dance at the Slaughterhouse&quot; is one of the best and is certainly the most grusome entry in the entire series.  Death has always been a preoccupation in the Scudder novels.  In New York City, death seems to be Scudder's constant companion as he struggles to remain alcohol free and to keep his life on track.  Here he begin two seemingly unconnected cases and follows their meandering leads until they start to connect in some brutally ugly ways.  Scudder has come into possession of a genuine snuff film, and he can't get it out of his mind.  Ultimately, he encounters a world of sex deviants and children who sell their bodies.  Along the way, recurring characters such as gangster Mickey Ballou, call girl Elaine and ex-pimp Chance provide plenty of color.<br />Block's Scudder series is almost unique among P.I. fiction in that it is able to maintain its edge even as its hero goes through significant life changes.  His continuing battle with the bottle provides an added tension that stays in the background like a predator ready to pounce.  Overall, this is one of the best Scudder novels and a must read for P.I. fiction fans.	2001-06-13

It is a sequal to the superb &quot;One More Time,&quot; collection that came out last year.  This time the introduction is written by former collegue Roger Ebert, who delivers an appropriately poinaint snapshot of the man.  Then Royko's own words take over.  As always, he is at his best when deflating puffed up politicians or defending the little guy against big corporations and big government.  This book adds a bonus of also including the verbal sparring that Royko would occasionally do with readers who outraged by a particular column.  It also singles out individual Royko sayings for easilly quotable repeating.  Royko was a true Chicago original and perhaps the best newspaper columnist of all time.  Reading this book is another reminder of how the void of his absence has yet to be filled and perhaps never will be.	2001-06-11

And I certainly don't regret it.  This book ranks with Truman Capote's classic &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; as a &quot;nonfiction novel&quot; crime story.  Author John Berendt, a native New Yorker, spent the better part of a decade living in Savannah.  As fate would have it, he came to know and interview the eccentric antiques dealer Jim Williams shortly before Williams shot a young hustler who turned out to be his homosexual lover.  Berendt was then privy to the inside story during Williams's unprecedented FOUR murder trials resulted from the shooting.  Along the way, he runs into a host of colorful and memorable characters who could only exist in a city as steeped in history and social tradition as Savannah.  Berendt gives the characters their due with masterful storytelling and compellingly readable prose.  &quot;Midnight&quot; was for him the story of a lifetime, and he pulls it off brilliantly.<br />The narrative is written in the first person and Berendt himself is a significant player in the events as they unfold.  He readilly admits that he has changed a number of names and even physical descriptions of some of the characters.  He also admits to inserting a few narrative flourishes to give the story flavor.  That's fine, because the central plot itself is not nearly as interesting as the colorful canvas upon which it unfolds.  Berendt's book is like a painting rather than a photograph.  And it should be admired as such.  Ultimately, it shows that truth really is much stranger than even the best fiction.	2001-06-06
1973805:US	51809405	R2RYU4S6KFP1IO	0385495641	161920063	Ghost Soldiers: The Forgotten Epic Story of World War II's Most Dramatic Mission	Books	4	9	13	N	N	An informative book with a few flaws	Hampton Sides' &quot;Ghost Soldiers&quot; is a book riding the wave of World War II nostalgia that is hot right now in the wake of &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot;  Perhaps that is why it seems like a book that was rushed out before it was ready.  Author Sides tells the main story well. In January 1945, a group of Rangers lauched a Top Secret mission through 30 miles of enemy held territory in the Phillippines to rescue just over 500 allied prisoners that were expected to be massacred as the Japanese withdrew.  The mission, though of no strategic value, was a spectactular success.<br />The story includes a cornucopia of colorful figures, from the gritty Colonel who organized the ranger unit to two Pillippino guerrilla leaders, to an American woman who posed as a Phillipna to spy on the Japanese to an American Chaplin in the prison camp and many more.  Sides brings them all to life expertly.<br />My quibble with the book is that Sides' prose occasionally veers in to the overly-dramamtic.  For example, the subtitle of the book refers to the mission as &quot;forgotten&quot; even though those who participated were well decorated and that there have been several other books written about the mission.  Even the use of the description &quot;Most Dramatic&quot; in the subtitle describing the mission is subject to debate.  These types of overstatements appear frequently in the narrative and are distracting.  Additionally, the book has no index or endnotes, which seems to indicated that it was a rush project.  Nevertheless, it is an entertaining read and is a fitting tribute to the brave souls who live and die on its pages.	2001-06-03

Apparently, author Roger L. Simon was trying to update the classic Phillp Marlowe type P.I. story to the hip and strange place that Southern California (especially the criminal underworld) had become by the early 1970s.  &quot;The Big Fix&quot; has a very strong sense of place and time, and today reads like a snapshot of that very confused era.  However, as a mystery, the plot is fairly pedestrian.  Set on the backdrop of a political campaign (though we never meet the candidate himself), one of Wine's ex-girlfriends is murdered shortly after bringing him a case.  However, Wine doesn't seem particularly outraged and pursues the case with a curious detachment.  Along the way he encounters a cornucopia of early 70s revolutionaries and hippies.  Ultimately though, the climax is a disappointment not worthy of the story's buildup.<br />Simon has all the moves of a classic P.I. writer.  Wine is appropriately cynical, hardedged and wise-cracking.  What he needs is a truly Marlowe-esque plot to sink his teeth into.	2001-06-03

I am a huge P.I. fiction fan, and on the basis of this novel I would place Earl W. Emmerson's hero only a notch or so below masters like Raymond Chandler, Lawrence Block and Loren Estleman.  Black is not as quick with a metaphor as the best P.I.s, nor is he as world weary or cynical.  And Emmerson leaves a lot of the details of his story a little fuzzy around the edges.  But the central mystery in &quot;Deviant Behavior&quot; held my interest and it raises some interesting points about the human capacity for guilt and mistrust.  The ending may stretch credibility a bit, but overall the novel is a good one for P.I. fiction fans.  I guess the best recommendation I can give is that I do plan to spend some more time with Mr. Black in the future.	2001-05-25

As such, it is about average for the series, which is to say better than average for the genre.  In this outing, Walker goes &quot;Downriver,&quot; which is a Detroiter's term for any part of Michigan that does not include the city.  Actually, he goes to the Upper Peninsula to give a released con a ride back to Detroit.  When he and the con get run off the road and the con hires him to help find $200,000 from a heist for which he was convicted but which he did not commit, Walker has his hands full.  The novel contains the usual social commentary and Walker is as much a loner as ever.  Regular characters like Detectives John Alderdyce and Mary Ann Thaler get only cameo appearances this time out.<br />Bottom line is that while this edition does not rank with &quot;The Glass Highway&quot; or &quot;Sugartown,&quot; among the best Walker novels, it is still well worthwhile in its own right.	2001-05-25

Elaine calls Scudder after many years because a psycopathic killer that the two of them joined forces to frame when Scudder was still a cop is back out on the streets and aiming to kill them both.  This entry into the Scudder series starts out rather slowly, given that the reader is way ahead of Scudder in figuring out what's going on.  By the second half, however, things pick up as Scudder comes to terms with what he must do.  Along the way, his cherished sobriety faces a mean test.<br />Overall, I would rank &quot;Baneyard&quot; in the middle of the Scudder novels, particularly because it starts off so conventionally.  But author Lawrence Block does not disappoint in the end, giving us the type of high quality resolution we have come to expect from Scudder.	2001-05-21

The story is fairly mundane for the series and features Detective Cotton Hawes out on a libido rampage.  This is obnoxios enough in and of itself, but at the end, McBain uses the old &quot;talking killer&quot; cliche, only here he multiplies it by three.  Bottom line is that these novels are better the more plausile they are.  This one contains enough implausibilities to make it hardly worthwhile.	2001-05-17
1997754:US	51809405	RDOGZZKDZ1U98	0871137836	323802732	Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World's Greatest Outlaw	Books	3	13	21	N	N	Informative, yet unfulfilling	For a straight journalistic account of how the U.S. Government joined forces with elements of the Colombian government to hunt down and kill Pablo Escobar, &quot;Killing Pablo&quot; brings the goods.  The years long pursuit of the man many considered to be the world's most notorious outlaw was punctuated by epic corruption and fantastic levels of sickening violence.  All of this author Mark Bowdon scrupulously documents.  The problem with the book is that Bowden has no sources who were truly on the inside of Escobar's empire.  This is not surprising given that most of his associates were killed.  But without first hand accounts of many of the violent incidents, they become a blur of facts that eventually become mind numbing.  By all accounts, Escobar was a cunning and ruthless man, but without first hand accounts, the reader really doesn't get to know him.  As a result, Bowden's narrative tends to drag after awhile.<br />Bowden does an excellent job of humanizing the men, both American and Colombian, who were reponsible for Escobar's downfall.  But their stories are just not as interesting.  Ultimately, at the end of the book Bowden shows just how futile the drug war has been to date.  It would be nice to think that the book might help America rethink its drug startegy.  But I think that's being overly optomistic.	2001-05-16

He fears he's losing his girlfriend (introduced in the previous novel, &quot;Hoodwink&quot;), has a crazy client's husband murdered right under his nose, and finds himself accused of both negligence AND theft.  Not to mention that he hates his new office space.  Overall, this edition of the Nameless series is good, but not amoung the best.  Part of the problem is that the three seperate mysteries compete for time with the personal stuff in a book that's relatively brief at just over 200 pages in trade paperback form.  As a result, the cases are a bit by-the-numbers and far too easilly resolved.  Nameless fans will probably enjoy it, but I would recommend newcomers start with either &quot;Hoodwink&quot; or &quot;Shackles&quot; instead.	2001-05-14

Author Bob Drury recalls some harrowing tales of rescue and tragic death and portrays his protagonists as rugged heros who seem driven to do what they do by their own genetic makeup.  Drury is a fine writer and his prose is eminently readable.  He introduces the reader to plenty of interesting characters and locales.<br />That said, the book is also a bit disjointed.  There is a main search and rescue story that is introduced in the beginning and which Drury returns to at times over the whole course of the book.  Drury also tends to throw a lot of geography, geology, meterology and history lessons into the mix (at least once, I got the impression that he was showing off his knowledge).  All of this is interesting, but gets in the way of his narrative.  He also makes a couple of mistakes that I noticed, for example once referring to the &quot;Seven Summits&quot; as the &quot;Seven Sisters.&quot;  Ultimately, the book doesn't hold together as a story, like with &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot;  Instead, it is a collection of good stories that should be quite pleasing to anyone with an interest in the subject matter.	2001-05-09

As a writer of detective fiction, Bill Pronzini tends to wear his influences on his sleeve, perhaps never more often than in &quot;Hoodwink.&quot;  This would be true even if he didn't make repeated references in the book to &quot;Mr. Marlowe&quot; and &quot;Mr. Spade.&quot;  His hero, the redoubtable &quot;Nameless&quot; detective, attempts to solve a puzzling mystery at a pulp convention.  Since Nameless is an avid pulp collector, he is in heaven even before he gets to meet some of his favorite authors and bed the bewitching daughter of one of them.  The case quickly turns ugly and baffling as the author who has give Nameless his in finds himself accused of murder and Nameless must...ahem...clear his name.<br />Overall, I found this novel to be of average quality for Pronzini, which is to say well above average as a work of detective fiction.  Pronzini isn't as quick with a metaphor as his heros &quot;Mr. Chandler&quot; and &quot;Mr. Hammett,&quot; and the plot here is a bit too convoluted.  Nevertheless, it is a goof read for those of us who love the hardboiled genre.	2001-05-09

We catch up with Scudder a few years after he joined AA.  He has a sponser and has managed to recover control of his life.  His day to day existence, meanwhile, hasn't changed much.  He still lives in a residential hotel and still conducts cases off the books as &quot;favors&quot; for friends.<br />The two cases are interesting.  One is for pay; a family wants to know the whereabouts of their missing daughter.  One is personal; an AA companion apparently commits suicide just before he is ready to confess his sins to Scudder.  Both take Scuder in some unlikely directions and the payoff is typically messy.  Meanwhile, author Lawrence Block introduces one his most interesting side characters to the series, the Irish gangster Mickey Ballou.  Overall, this is a solid Scudder novel that is not quite on par with the best of the series.  But any Scudder novel makes for excellent reading.	2001-05-04

Grazulis has obviously dedicated a good part of his life to studying Tornadoes.  This book has &quot;labor of love&quot; written many times over between its pages.  And yet, it is an odd book.  Grazulis combines tornado anecdotes, tornado science, tornado safety and even tornado mythology into a strange hodgepodge of information.  This is not the book to buy for great narratives of tornado destruction.  Grazulis' accounts are second hand and mostly used to illustrate his other points.  Nor is the book packed full of great pictures.  It has some, all in black and white photos and some that are more than a century old.  This book is really an encyclopedic account of everything there is to know about tornadoes.  I learned a lot, even if I found the book's style a bit bemusing.  If you love tornadoes on more than a superficial level, I would recommend it.  Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.	2001-05-03

The first was an epic disaster that killed over 23,000 people and obliterated a small city.  The other was the result of sheer human stupidity, yet another example of man thinking he's smarter than nature.  Six scientists and three tourists were killed and several others horribly maimed because they were standing pratically on top of an active volcano crater when it had a minor eruption.  All of the victims probably would have survived had they taken some basic precautions.<br />The leader of the group, self-serving, aggrandizing geologist Steve Williams was largely responsible for the laxes that led to the tragedy.  And yet after barely surviving his own mule-headiness, he manages to convince the press that he's a hero through his own vulgar audacity.<br />Cheers to author Victoria Bruce for publishing the truth and defalting Williams' own self serving book about these events.  The book's only flaw is that the first tragedy doesn't get quite the coverage it deserves, as if she were in a hurry to skewer the villian of the story and rushed it.  Nevertheless, this is still a well written, informative and ultimately depressing account.	2001-04-28

Those who do not revel in cynical or vicious humor should avoid Queenan at all costs.  But for those like me who are more apt to read the newspaper review of the one star movie than that of the four star movie just for the laughs, then this book is your Valhalla.  Queenan spares no medium; books, videos, concerts, cds, movies, restaurants, Broadway shows; they are all the victims of his biting wit.  Even when h was trashing something that I like, I enjoyed his insights.  And because he also writes it all in a bit of a winking manner and he keeps it under 200 total pages, it doesn't become overbearing.<br />This was the first Queenan that I have read (I bought it based on hearing him on Don Imus's radio show).  That I will be searching out more of his titles is the best compliment I can pay him.	2001-04-28

Once again, our wise cracking and world weary hero prowls the streets of his native Detroit with moves as fast as his wit.  In this outing, Walker's favorite femme fatale, the recovering hooker Iris (first introduced in the series debut, &quot;Motor City Blue&quot;), is back in town and Walker cannot resist doing her a favor by trying to find the father she never knew.  Along the way he explores Detroit's fading jazz scene and butts heads with an assortment of lowlifes and mobsters.  He also finds to his dismay that his only ally in the police department, his old friend homicide Detective John Alderdyce, is on an extended leave of absence suffering from burnout.<br />&quot;Lady Yesterday&quot; is another excellent entry into this fine series.  Walker novels ready like latter day Phillip Marlowe and his cases always take unexpected twists.  This one isn't the best of the series (that would be &quot;Sugartown&quot; or &quot;The Glass Highway&quot;) because it relies a little too heavilly on some of the elements of past entries.  Nevertheless, it is still a very good read.	2001-04-25

I'll take its film noir-ish depiction of the future over Star Wars's cartoonish-ness any time.  And after all these years, I finally got around to reading the source material.  When they say that &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; only &quot;inspired&quot; the movie &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; brother, they are not kidding.  &quot;Blade Runner&quot; took a story written in Phillip K. Dick's usual absurdist style and gave it flesh and blood.  Dick's writing is quite philosophical and tends to leave you cold as a reader.  Often his characters act in ways that seem to make little sense on a narrative level.  &quot;Androids&quot; is no exception to this.  The concepts are great, but the details are baffling.  For instance, could anyone really live on an Earth mired in the throes of a post nuclear holocaust raidiation cloud?<br />Ultimately, comparing &quot;Androids&quot; to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is quite unfair to both.  &quot;Blade Runner&quot; represents that rare science fiction film with more brains than brawn while &quot;Androids&quot; is a typical Phillip K. Dick mindbender.  If you like his stuff, you'll like this book.  If you're contemplating reading it just because you liked the movie, don't waste your time.	2001-04-23

But at their core, the two books are fundamentally different.  Whereas &quot;Troupers&quot; argued that conflict was necessary to the advancement of society, &quot;Armor&quot; is wearied by the utter futility of war.  While the battle scenes in &quot;Troupers&quot; are exhilerating, the same scenes in &quot;Armor&quot; are grusome and depressing.  &quot;Armor&quot; has no coming of age feel like &quot;Troupers&quot; and nothing good comes from the battles that are fought in its pages.<br />About one hundred pages in, the book makes an abrupt shift from the third person narrative following the hero (and sole survivor of its first battle) Felix to the first person narrative of adventurer Jack Crow.  The shift is unexpected and abrupt and leaves the reader somewhat disoriented.  It is in fact a high wire act as a plot device that author John Steakley manages to pull off successfully.  Without the Jack Crow section, the Felix portion of the story would be unrelentingly bleak.<br />Overall, this is an excellent novel that is only weak around the margins.  Numerous details are not fully explained and vivid descriptions are not Steakley's long suit.  Nevertheless it is worthwhile example of military science fiction that rates only a notch or so below &quot;Troupers&quot; and &quot;The Forever War.&quot;	2001-04-23

My only quibble is that the part with the animals and babies comes off primarily as window dressing.  It would not have altered the story much to have these characters portrayed as human adults.  Nevertheless, this is a challenging and entertaining novel for those who like mind bending stories ala Phillip K. Dick.	2001-04-22

Phillip Marlowe is an honest, world weary and compassionate tough guy who is as quick with his mouth as his is with his gun.  Chandler is a master at creating quirky charcters, memorable villians and is as good with a metaphor as any writer has ever been.  That said, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; set in then-contemporary Los Angeles (circa 1939), reads like a cultural artifact.  Life and investigative work was a lot different back then.  It was a time when a daughter of a wealthy man posing for nude photographs WAS in fact shocking enough to be a potential for blackmail.  Today, no one would think twice about it.<br />Nevrtheless, if you want to see how modern detective fiction as well as modern noir got its start, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; is for you.	2001-04-22

Walker is a lonely, quick witted and highly principled P.I. who knows his native Detroit inside and out.  In this novel, Walker is trying to locate an old friend he served with in Vietnam and in the process reveals more about his past than he ever had previously.  He also becomes involved with the bewitching book editor Louise Starr, a holdover character from the previous Walker novel, &quot;Sugartown.&quot;  The only negative is that the story's police corruption angle is a bit shopworn.  The Vietnam angle adds considerable weight and the ending is appropriately violent.<br />Look for the i-books vintage paperback edition of this novel to be released sometime in Summer 2001.  The i-books editions of the Walker series are first rate paperbacks with extra goodies added, including an afterword by the author.	2001-04-07
2046392:US	51809405	R17O69M5NHPCPI	0671019473	656612277	PAST TENSE (John Marshall Tanner Mysteries)	Books	4	11	12	N	N	A Fairly Dark P.I. Novel	&quot;Past Tense&quot; was the first book that I have read in Stephen Greenleaf's John Marshall Tanner P.I. series.  I read a lot of P.I. novels, and my usual rule is; the darker, the better.  And that is why I found &quot;Past Tense&quot; to be a very engaging novel.  Greenleaf is not a master of metaphor like Raymond Chandler with Phillip Marlowe or Loren Estleman with Amos Walker.  And his Marsh Tanner is not a man battling personal demons like Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder or Andrew Vachss' Burke.  But the story here is worthy of any of those other anti-heros.  One of Tanner's best friends, an honest cop, has suddenly gone on a revenge killing rampage.  In the process, he has cut himself off from everyone who cares about him.  Tanner investigates at first to find an answer to his baffling behavior, and then to try and save his life.  The plot line is a bit convoluted and Greenleaf ends up relying on the old police corruption cliche, but it all leads to one of the more shocking endings I've seen in a P.I. novel.<br />Greenleaf may not be a writer whose style is equal to the masters of the genre.  But with &quot;Past Tense,&quot; he has delivered one quite memorable novel.	2001-04-03

Some of Hallinan's points are valid, such as the folly in giving non-violent drug offenders longer avearage sentences than murderers, for example.  But on others he sounds like the type of bleeding heart that aided and abedded the crime explosion of the 1960s and 1970s.  While it is true that more Americans than ever are being locked up, it is also true that crime rates have taken a dramatic tumble.  Unfortunately, Hallinan refuses to conceed any connection between these two facts.<br />Hallinan's most valid arguments come when he is decrying the rise of private prisons and the profit motive that has come to create dangerous working conditions for those working inside.  Depressed communities have become agressive bidders for prisons as a way of bolstering the local economy and prisons have replaced factories as the primary employers in many towns.<br />Overall, Hallinan's book has many arguments.  How you'll take them will largely depend upon your point of view.  They are strewn haphazzardly throughout the book and there is no logical sequencing.  But there is enough good information to make the book worthwhile for those with an interest in the subject matter.	2001-04-02

The book gives a brief history of how fast food empires like McDonalds and KFC were born and how they came to be the collosal international giants they are today. Schlosser then goes on to describe every possible social evil to which the fast food business is even remotely connected. Some of his points are dead on, like how the fast food industry would rather spend tens of millions of dollars in research to make its kitchen equipment even more idiot proof rather than paying higher wages and training its workforce. At other times, like when he bemoans the rapid growth of America's suburbs and how the national retail chains have made everywhere look the same, Schlosser comes off as a typical leftist with an anti-big business bias. Schlosser would like to blame the ills he describes in his book on \\"heartless corporations,\\" but he forgets that with the rise of 401K plans and mutual funds, a large porportion of the population now has a stake in these big businesses.<br />On balance though, Schlosser's book sounds a warning that needs to be heard. The problem is that the portion of the public most likely to read this book are likely to be those who spend the least amount of time in McDonald's in the first place. Getting the masses to say no to fast food seems about as likely as getting them to turn off their televisions. Schlosser has taken a good shot at the fast food industry, but I doubt that the industry will even notice.	2001-03-31

If, however, you are looking for good storytelling befitting the James legend, you should look elsewhere.  Author Ted Yeatman has done all he can to explode the myths surrounding the James Gang and to show them for what they were; namely a group of violent desperados unworthy of the considerable public sympathy and reverance they have received.  Contrary to legend, the James brothers were not forced into banditry by their service as Confederate guerillas.  In fact, that had been pardoned and could have led peaceful postwar lives had they so chose.<br />Overall, Yeatman's arguments and extensive research (there's over 140 pages of notes and exhibits) would go down much smoother if he could write with the touch of a Stephen Ambrose.  As it is, his prose often takes the excitement out of what was a pair of very interesting lives.	2001-03-27

Interestingly, Estleman places the source of his anger as the backdrop for the story.  In the early 1980s, Detroit Mayor Coleman Young made a legally shaky eminent domain deal with General Motors that forced hundreds of long time residents from their homes so that a new assembly plant could be built.  The displaced homeowners got a very raw deal and a historic neighborhood was destroyed.<br />But the story Estleman weaves around these events is actually one of Amos Walker's more lively and fun.  For once he finds a love interest to lighten his dreary existance.  And the two cases he investigates involving Eastern European immigrants lead him in some interesting directions.  Overall, this makes the fifth Amos Walker book the best so far in the series (I've been reading them in order) a fact which was confirmed when the book won the Shamus Award for best private eye novel of 1984.  This i-books edition also includes inaddition to the newly published author's notes, a recent vintage Amos Walker short story at the end.  Think of it as dessert after a fine meal.	2001-03-27

Some of the &quot;Nameless&quot; novels tend to be a bit by-the-numbers, but the plot here is truly ingenious.  Namless is kidnapped and chained in a remote mountain cabin and left to slowly starve to death.  His escape and search for the man who imprisioned him make for some of the best detective fiction ever.  As a bonus, Nameless becomes introspective during his imprisonment and confesses much about his childhood and how he became who he is.  This book is a MUST read for P.I. fiction fans.	2001-03-23

In this book, the freshly rehabbed Scudder recalls a case from the heart of his alcoholic period (circa 1975).  He gets involved in a couple of cases involving his barfly buddies.  One involves extortion, the other a burglary and murder.  In neither instance is Scudder terribly enthusiastic about being involved.  Author Lawrence Block vividly describes the drinking life with the eye of a man who's obviously been there.  The descriptions of self denial and lives slowly being wasted are memorable without being heavy handed.  &quot;Ginmill&quot; is a hardboiled P.I. story from a master author who is on top of his game.  Fans of Chandler-esque fiction should love it.	2001-03-21

Stoner is a hardboiled P.I. from Cincinnati who gets involved in some sometime brutally violent stories.  &quot;Extenuating Circumstances&quot; is no exception, but it stretches plausibility a bit too much.

As the lucky initiated know, Adams has been writing his weekly column, &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; for alternative newpapers for nearly thirty years now.  Adams is a good-natured arrogant know-it-all who uses reader questions both to show off his knowledge and flex his keen sense of humor.  He is at the same time both hilareous and informative.  He also tackles plenty of subjects that mainstream journalists will not touch.  For example, in this book he discusses the little known practice of eating the human placenta.  There is no one quite like Cecil.  And for that we must be thankful.	2001-03-18

Death hangs omnipresent as the intrepid Walker tries to bring a cop killer to justice before he is killed by the police.  Along the way he encounters black militants, a bounty hunter, a sex-starved cop's wife and more dead bodies than he would care to count.  Author Loren D. Estleman runs his hero through the wringer in this adventure and it is a great ride indeed.  Walker is everything a great P.I. ought to be, tough, sarcastic, somewhat alcoholic and beholden to a his own private code of justice.  He is Phillip Marlowe updated for modern times.<br />This &quot;I-Book&quot; edition features the added bonus of an essay by the author regarding his inspiriations for the novel.  Addtionally, it also has an Amos Walker short story, &quot;Redneck&quot; that comes along at the end like the desert to a fine meal.  Overall a very worthwhile package.	2001-03-17

The battle itself and its aftermath (the Texan victory at San Jacinto) are given a good overview as well.  Along the way, the authors attempt to portray the battle for what it was, free of either liberal condemnations of the defenders as imperialisist or reactionary attempts to elevate the defenders to God-like status.  The truth lies somewhere in the middle of the elevated rhetoric.  The defenders made a galliant stand against an authoritarian despot, but they did so in defense of slavery among other things.  Whatever else they may have been, the stand of Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, Colenol Travis and the others remains unassailable as an act of bravery.<br />The second half of the book focusses on the history of the shrine since the battle.  It covers preservation attempts and the lionization of the battle by such 20th Century luminaries as Walt Disney and John Wayne.  The Alamo has become a powerful political symbol, a fact that was emphasized particularly during the Vietnam war.<br />All of this adds up to a fascinating and very well written book.  The only flaw is that covers the first part too quickly, giving more of an overview than an in-depth history.  Nevertheless it is still an informative and enjoyable read.	2001-03-17

Fiction	Les Roberts's private detective Milan Jacovich has all the right moves to be great character on the order of a Phillip Marlowe or a Matthew Scudder.  He's wisecracking, lonely, cynical, capable of violence and he spends a lot of times in bars.  He also lives by his own incorruptable moral code.  If author Les Roberts had come up a story worthy of his hero, he'd have a classic on his hands.  Unfortunately, &quot;Pepper Pike&quot; is a fairly pedestrian who-dunnit? closer in spirit to Agatha Christie than Raymond Chandler.  Some of the scenes hardly ring believable, like when Milan roughs up a mob boss and only gets beaten up rather than killed for his trouble.  The story lacks a great villian and Roberts relies on the old knock-on-the-head move a couple too many times.<br />&quot;Pepper Pike&quot; has atmosphere and attitude to burn.  It shows plenty of promise, but is ultimately unfulfilling.	2001-03-14

Today we tend to forget what a historic feat the building of the great bridge actually was. At the time of its construction, it was twice as large as the next largest suspension bridge in the world and it used plenty of never before tested construction methods. Hard to believe today, but its huge brick towers were at the time the tallest structures anywhere in New York. McCullough tells the story of the genius immigrant engineer John A. Roebling who designed the bridge and died horribly as the result of an accident during the planning phase. Roebling's son, Washington Roebling, took over his father's grandiose dream and suffered horrible physical torment from a little known ailment that would come to be officially known as \\"Cassion's Disease\\" after the huge cassions that Roebling sunk into the East River to support his bridge. Today we know the malady more popularly as \\"The Bends.\\"<br />McCullough is a first rate history author who knows how to convey his story with all the power of a great novel. Like Stephen Ambrose, he makes history come alive on the printed page. McCullough touches upon every event remotely connected to the bridge's construction, including the politics, backdealing and second guessing that the construction team faced every step of the way. \\"The Great Bridge\\" is a great work of history worthy of its subject.	2001-03-14

Estleman's suberb P.I. series.  Its Christmas in Detroit and our hero gets seduced, beaten up, arrested, threatened; your usual yuletide activities.  Along the way he encouters crooked cops, media hungry politicians, spoiled rich kids and ham-handed Federal agents.  I'd rate &quot;The Glass Highway&quot; a notch above the first two novels in the series (&quot;Motor City Blue&quot; and &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;) because its plot is tighter and more plausible.  Nevertheless, there seems to be no such thing as a bad Amos Walker mystery.<br />As a bonus, this I-Books edition features an afterword from the author regarding his inspirations for the novel.  It also contains an Amos Walker short story, &quot;Cigarette Stop&quot; as the dessert to a very fine meal.	2001-03-09

Like many of the earlier Scudder tales, it is relatively short and not a greatly complex story.  The plotline is clever; an extortionist gets a premonition of his own murder and hires Scudder in advance to investigate if anything happens to him.  The story is well told, and this still being Scudder's drinking period, it is full of plenty of despair and loneliness.  One major flaw exists however.  One of the people the extortionist is blackmailing is politically connected figure who has sex with underage boys.  Scudder's lack of outrage at the man's activity leads to a less than approriate conclusion of the story.  If this had been Andrew Vachss' Burke, the pedophile would have gotten his just desserts.  Overall, this is a fairly conventional mystery by Block standards.  But it does have its moments.	2001-03-08

Eventually, this would lead him to AA, sobriety and a more upbeat outlook.  But back in the bad old days, he investigates a compelling mystery in which the supposed victim of a serial killer turns out to have been the victim of a copycat crime.  This is made more complicated by the fact that the murder happened nine years before.  Though the story is relatively brief at a mere 180 pages in trade paperback form, it is well written and contains enough suspense to keep you on edge.  Scudder wasn't a happy guy before he dried up.  And this is one of the best of his early &quot;wet&quot; adventures.	2001-03-08

Walker is a wise cracking tough guy and Estleman writes with the immediacy and poetry of masters such as Raymond Chandler and John D. MacDonald.  Walker is a much a part of his native Detroit as the Tigers.  This entry in the series takes Walker on a sidetrip to a sleepy bedroom community that adds more fun to the storyline.  Overall, Walker is one of the best hardboiled P.I.s around.<br />A word about the i-books publications that are reprinting Estleman's Walker novels.  These are fine quality paperbacks, each of which features bonus material, in this case a short essay by Estleman about the novel and how he came up with his ideas.  It is like the cherry on a fine dessert.	2001-03-07

His hero, former Navy SEAL John Caine, is a unique tough guy who can both out muscle and out think his adversaries.  The novel is written with considerable wit and style and Knief provides plenty of local Hawaiian color to spice things up.  If Caine is a bit too close in lifestyle and personality to John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee, we can forgive him for the tribute.<br />The problem with the novel starts as the climax approaches and it goes from being a gripping private detective story to reading like the script of a Steven Segal movie.  The violence goes over the top and plausibility goes right out the window.  Knief is hip enough to make Caine's love interest a modern tough woman, but unfortunately he falls into the old girl-taken-hostage-by-the-badguys routine.<br />Overall, not a bad first effort from Knief, but there is considerable room for improvement.	2001-03-07

Ford's Leo Watterman private detective series that I have read.  I found Ford to be a decent writer and Waterman to be a moderately interesting character.  But neither can hold a candle to such greats as, say, Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder or the master Chandler's Phillip Marlowe.  The back cover says that Ford is a former creative writing teacher and that figures because his writing is at time a bit too cute in its effort to be entertaining.  The biggest drawback of Waterman's charcater, son of a now deceased prominent politician, is that he's far too happy with his domestic life and too well known in the community to be the classic alienated cynical private eye.  Ford gives a good feel for life in Seattle as a backdrop for Waterman's antics.  Waterman is also properly quick with both his wit and his weapons when need be.  But his continuous run ins with the cops get tiresome after awhile and the story is bloated by about an extra fifty pages or so.<br />Overall, I rank Ford squarely in the middle of P.I. fiction writers.  Though I enjoyed spending time with Waterman on this one occasion, I will not be going out of my way to seek him out again.	2001-03-07

Matthew Scudder was a lot differnt than the man he would come to be.  In his series debut, Scudder has not yet admitted that he has an alcohol problem.  Lawrence Block introduces us to the man who quit the NYPD because he just wasn't up to being a cop anymore.  Scudder's first case (literary case, anyway) is fairly conventional by the standards of the series.  Scudder is hired by the estranged father of a murdered girl not to find the killer, who is already dead, but so the father can begin to understand her life.  The story is brief, clocking in at only 186 easy to read pages in trade paperback form.  It has little of the narrative complexity that would later serve Block so well.  And, you can see the ending coming well before it gets there.  Nevertheless, it is still stylish noir with the right mixture of loniliness, cynicism and despair.  And as with all Scudder novels, the actual violence is kept to a relative minimum.  Overall, not Scudder's best but worth it for fans of the series.	2001-03-03

Once again, Walker finds himself at odds with the police and mixed up with rough company as he tries to find a stripper who hired him to find her BEFORE she disappeared.  Once again, the bad streets of Detroit are the setting for the story, though Estleman takes Walker on an effective side trip to a sleepy bedroom community.  Walker is just what a great P.I. ought to be; a lonely, cynical, alcoholic who nevertheless cares a bit too much. <br />Walker is one of the best hardboiled P.I.'s working the genre.

By now, Vachss has come to wear his anti-abuse feelings on sleeve so obviously that many of these stories take far too predictable turns.  Many of them are also far too short (some only a couple of pages) to have any real impact.  The &quot;Underground&quot; series is sci-fi that makes little sense.  The &quot;Cross&quot; stories aren't as realistic or satisfying as Vachss' Burke novels.  That said, the book is at least an entertaining read for Vachss fans.  Even when he's not at his best, he is at least interesting.	2001-02-28

Thompson ever took to writing detective fiction, this is how it would most likey read.  Crumley's P.I. Milo Milodragovitch is back from his best written work, &quot;The Wrong Case.&quot;  This story is far more violent and drug addled than the previous Milo adventure, and that weakens it somewhat.  But its still a hell of a fun ride.  Crumley's prose at times remind you of the Dr.'s &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&quot;  Given that Milo also haunts the West, this is an apt analogy.  Overall, this is an exellent hardboiled detective fiction novel that is not for the faint of heart.	2001-02-28

Holt spends most of the book extolling the virtures of the pristine and empty West while lamenting that so much of it is being ruined by housing developments, strip mines and golf courses.  Of course, economic development is always a double edged sword, but Holt confines his comments to merely ranting impotently against it.<br />That said, Holt captures some great images and moments in his book.  Most of these are his descriptions of the land and the joys of getting back to nature.  As a storyteller, he doesn't have the touch of a Bill Bryson, and his narrative wanders unfocussed at times and not in chronological order.  Nevertheless, he creates a strong sense of place that is worthwhile for anyone interested in his subject matter.	2001-02-22

Early on in the narrative, Scudder is told frankly by a young doctor after a two-day alcohol blackout, &quot;if you drink, you'll die.&quot;  Scared by the warning, Scudder takes a case he doesn't want in a despearte attempt to distract him from alcohol.  His struggles with the bottle come across very real and are harrowing to behold.  The case is a good one as well with Scudder attempting to track the manaical killer of a hooker who was trying to leave the life.  Death is an ever constant theme, with the book's title being a riff on the old literary saying &quot;there are eight million stories in the naked city.&quot;<br />This book is everything great private detective fiction should be; dark, cynical, violent and lonely.  Frankly, I like Scudder better during this period than later on after he sobers up.  If you agree, you'll love this book.	2001-02-22

It is essentially a history of storm forcasting going all the way back to Ben Franklin's time.  And while it is informative, it lacks the type of thilling narrative in its weather stories that one would expect.  Most of the stories are taken from other books or magazine/newspaper articles.  And unfortunately, the author makes at least one serious error by repeating the long standing falsehood that meteorolgist Issac Cline rode up and down the beach on horseback to warn residents of Galveston of the approaching 1900 hurricane.  This is a myth, dispelled by the far superior book &quot;Issac's Storm,&quot; that just won't die.<br />Overall, &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; has plenty of historical information, but the reading is unlikely to have the pulse quickening effect of even a mild spring thunderstorm.	2001-02-18

Author Pete Davies provides an exccelent account of Hurricanes Mitch and Floyd and the horrendous damage they wrought.  He also sounds a dire warning about the near certainty that the Gulf or East Coasts of the U.S. will someday experience a catastrophe of epic proportions.  Imagine, writes the author, if Mitch had followed the same storm track as Hurricane Irene, a Catagory 1 storm that deluged Miami not long after Floyd made headlines.<br />A lion's share of author Pete Davies's narrative involves the stories of the forecasters and storm chasers who track these meteorlogical beasts.  And while their stories are somtimes interesting, they don't have the same power as the descriptions of the hurricaines themselves.  Overall however, &quot;Inside the Hurricane&quot; is a decent book for weather-philes.	2001-02-18

Estleman has talent to burn and it shows in his first novel featuring private detective Amos Walker (originally published in 1980).  Like any good P.I., Walker doesn't work the streets of his native Detroit, he INHABITS them.  Also like any good P.I., Walker drinks a little too much despite his cynicism, cares a little too much and his personal life leaves a lot to be desired.  The plot is more complex than is the norm with such stories, and perhaps it pushes credibility a bit towards the end.  Nevertheless, Estleman has both talent and style to burn.  He is among the best at using metaphors to describe the action.<br />Fans of John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee, Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder, George Pellaconos's Nick Stefanos and Johnathan Valin's Harry Stoner will love Amos Walker.	2001-02-18

Fiction	I am a huge fan of hardboiled P.I. fiction, and this is the first Matthew Scudder book that I've had a chance to read.  And while I found the book to be a bit on the slow side in terms of action, the plot was so fascinating that I couldn't put it down.  The book's real subject matter is death, and as one character says, man is the only animal who knows he's going to die.  He's also the only animal that drinks.  Somehow, there must be a connection.  Those strictly interested in shoot-'em-ups and continuous action should look elsewhere.  Those who like their P.I. stories on the philisophical side will love it.<br />As a character, I found Scudder interesting, especially his background and his continuous battle with alcoholism.  Like any good P.I., he inhabits the landscape around him (in this case, Manhattan) so well that he becomes part of the scenery.  I also didn't mind the fact that he was involved in a stable relationship (often a weakness in other P.I. serieses.  A classic P.I. ought to be a loner).  His love interest is just quirky enough to add spice to the story and isn't used merely to give him a contrived vulnerability.  Overall, the best compliment I can pay is that I don't expect that this will be my last encounter with Scudder.	2001-02-17

With &quot;The Mexican Tree Duck,&quot; Crumley brings back Private Investigator C.W. Sughrue from &quot;Kiss.&quot;  Alas, the results are not nearly as satisfying.  Crumley is quite adept at creating effective moments.  For example, there is a flashback here to Sughrue's service in the Vietnam War in which an officer is killed by a poisonous snake that I will not soon forget.  There are numerous such moments in this book, but not enough to make up for a story that stretches credibility to the breaking point.  The novel also lacks an effective villian, and many of Sughrue's foes here are the type faceless minions you'd expect in a James Bond movie.<br />Overall, &quot;The Mexican Tree Duck&quot; is not a bad novel.  Crumley at his worst is still a literary force who can put to shame a lot of the lightweights writing mystery novels these days.  But I wouldn't recommend this as a first Crumley novel.  Read one of his classics and get familiar with his unique genius first.	2001-02-10

That an individual so thoroughly despicable could be so idolized and worshiped says a lot about what's wrong with where America puts its values.  No doubt, DiMaggio was one of the greatest atheletes of the 20th century.  He was also a legendary womanizer who cavorted with mobsters and took mob money on the side.  He broke off all relations with his son (who died a victim of his father's fame shortly after he did) and had little to do with his own siblings, two of whom were also major leaguers.  He was a man capable of cutting off frendships that had lasted decades over the tiniest perceived slight.  The only touching aspect of his life was his genuine love affair with Marilyn Monroe, a woman whose life he tried to save even as he physically abused her.<br />Cramer is a first rate journalist and his lively prose makes &quot;Joltin' Joe&quot; come to life for the reader, warts and all.  Cramer manages to get inside the head of the man behind the myth despite the fact that he received no cooperation from his subject.  Cramer has the proper respect for DiMaggio's on field accomplishments and the proper amount of dismay at the bitter, stingy, thoroughly dislikable old man DiMaggio became.  The closing of the book shows DiMaggio as a greedy huckster so willing to cash in on his own name that he was still attempting to autograph baseballs for cash on his deathbed.<br />This is one of the absolute best recent sports biographies.  And if it should happen to cause some people to re-examine their passion for sports memorabilia, so much the better.	2001-02-10

In fact, &quot;Brown's Requiem&quot; is the only novel of his that I have read, because it is the only one of his books I've found that is a straight private detective story.  And as an example of the that genre, this books stands among the best.  Ellroy's hero, Fritz Brown, is everything a good P.I. should be; world weary, cynical, alcoholic and carrying heavy baggage from his past.  He also has plenty of good character eccentricities, like a fascination for classical music.  He is also prone to make that classic P.I. mistake, to fall in love with a woman he knows he probably shouldn't fall in love with.<br />All of this said the book takes some unexpected twists and turns.  Brown ends up investigating his own client, his romantic interest turns out to have a VERY complicated past and his case turns out to be far more elaboarate than it first appears.  All of this leads to a violent and satisfying climax, like any good P.I. novel should.  Fans of P.I. masters such Andrew Vachss, George Pellecanos and yes, Raymond Chandler, out to be right at home with Fritz Brown.	2001-02-07

Simpson uses this story to dramatize how far mainstream mountaineering has strayed from its original adventurer roots.  The book's main drawback is Simpson's analysis of the 1996 Everest disaster which has been over reported and covered far more completely by those who were actually there.  Simpson closes the book with an interestting but relatively uneventful recent climb of his own that seems to have little to do with the rest of the book.<br />Overall, Simpson is an important figure in mountaineering and he does have plenty to say.  Those with an interest in the subject should enjoy this book very much.	2001-02-07

Bruce Henderson manages to combine yet another polar exploration story (been a bunch of those published lately, hasn't there?) with an unexpected twist. He tells the story of the failed first U.S. expedition to discover the North Pole (circa 1870), which was grounded by something far more sinister than the usual mishaps. In fact its commander, the irrepressible Charles Hall, was mostly likely poisoned to death by one of his own shipmates. The story is primarily told through the eyes of Captain George Tyson, the honorable soul who Hall asked to join the mission and who was the unfortunate witness to the tragic and criminal events that took place on board the ship. Later, Tyson survived a harrowing six months drifting on an ice flow before he and eighteen compainions were rescued. That last part of the book deals with the inconclusive inquiry into Hall's death and the loss of the ship.<br />As polar exploration tales go, &quot;Fatal North&quot; is not one of the more interesting because the mission itself was such an abject failure. What is more interesting is Henderson's account of how such a mission can be destroyed by human avarice. Henderson is a fine writer and the prose in the book is crisp and lively. The text checks in at a snappy 290 pages that could be read in a single snow bound day.	2001-02-07

While it purports to be about &quot;Jefferson, Adams, and the Revolutionary Election of 1800,&quot; not until over two-thirds of the narrative have passed does author Bernard Weisberger begin to discuss the election itself and then for only one chapter.  The book is really a concise political history of the United States from the ratification of the Constitution through the end of Jefferson's first term as President.  The prose is lively and highly readable.  And Weisberger is correct in his assertion that the election of 1800, in which a President who was denied re-election voluntarily relenquished power for the first time, was a monumental if often overlooked event in the early history of the nation.<br />The book actually reads like a series of magazine articles with each chapter covering a separate event.  This may reflect Weisberger's longtime involvement as a contributing editor for &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine.  At just over 300 pages of narrative, &quot;America Afire&quot; reads like the work of Stephen Ambrose in the way it brings history alive for those who are not academic scholars.	2001-01-31

Upon first release, the book was a massive bestseller, more because it is an easy read than because it is great literature.  What it is primarily useful for now is as a means of filling in details that the first two Godfather films didn't have time to cover even with their considerable length.  Such detail includes the background story of Johnny Fontaine, the Frank Sinatra-esque entertainer who is a loyal Godson.  Also fleshed out are the characters of the loyal hitman Luca Brazzi and of Sonny's mistress, who would become the mother of Michael's eventual successor as Don in &quot;Godfather Part 3.&quot;  There is also more information about Moe Green and the feud over the Corleone move to Nevada.<br />Puzo is an effective storyteller and he keeps things moving along at a snappy pace.  The Don of the book doesn't seem larger than life the way Marlon Brando does in the movie.  &quot;The Godfather&quot; is often described as a &quot;trash&quot; novel, but reading would be a lot more fun if all such novels were as good as this one.	2001-01-28

Francis Ford Coppola was the one who pumped the magic into Puzo's vision and made it a tale for the ages rather than a soon-to-be-forgotten pop phenomenon.  That said, with &quot;The Last Don&quot; Puzo essentially attmepts to do a rewrite of the book that made hime famous.  Unfortunately, he had little in the way of fresh ideas to enliven his old premise.  Like the Don of the title, Puzo was past his prime, though he refused to admit it.  And making Hollywood the center of the plot is a nod to his considerable experience with moviemaking.  One would say that he knows more about filmmaking than about the gangster life.<br />Ultimately, &quot;The Last Don,&quot; is what &quot;The Godfather&quot; would have been without Coppola; a massively popular novel that will be little remembered by posterity.	2001-01-28

The story is not nearly as memorable, and the hero seems to have stepped out of a James Bond film.  The old chauvanist James Bond, that is.  Overall, I found the tone of the novel entirely too lighthearted to take seriously.  And it is not remotely scary, which perhaps explains why the horror film of the same name was such a flop.  Unlike the classic &quot;Starship Troupers,&quot; this is science fiction that has not aged well.	2001-01-26

Detective Frank Carlucci is an honest cop and a good detective in the hopeless corrupt world of the mid-21st century.  He is determined to do the right thing despite the potentially negative consequences.  The real strength of the book is the vivid desciptions of the streets of San Francisco that leave you feeling that it is inevitable that the world will turn out this way.  Any of the books in this series, which include &quot;Destroying Angel,&quot; and &quot;Carlucci's Heart,&quot; are well worth owning.	2001-01-26

It combines plausible science with an intriguing look at the future.  It has plenty of action and certainly plenty of BIG ideas.  Like Robert Heinlein's &quot;Starship Troupers,&quot; it is a military coming-of-age story; the difference being that here the hero is a reluctant  warrior rather than an enthusiastic one.  The storytelling is almost hypnotic in its intenisty.  This version (which is the author's original version) has a couple of minor inconsistancies because of a middle section that was left out of the original publication.  No matter, the restored section makes the story even more fascinating.  Author Joe Haldeman has also created some of the most realistic seeming space battles that I've yet read.  He acknowledges the effects that the vast distances of space would have on warfare rather than ignoring them as inconveniant facts.  He also uses time distortion to a maximum effect.<br />Overall, this is one of the best modern science fiction novels available.  Those who loved &quot;Starship Troupers&quot; in particular should get themselves a copy.	2001-01-26

A story about a group of post-Greenhouse effect stormchasers going after the BIG one (tornado) should be faster paced and much scarier than this novel.  Sterling also does not give a very coherent view of what the world is like during its period of so-called &quot;heavy weather,&quot; given that all of the action takes place in Texas and Oklahoma.  There is also an evil consortium subplot that makes very little sense.  That said, most of the the main characters are quite likable and very believable.  Their story is just not as remarkable as it ought to be.<br />Overall, I would give this book a marginal recommendation to sci-fi buffs and perhaps disaster buffs.  It moves slowly at times, but there are enough interesting ideas to make it worth your while if you're interested in the subject matter.	2001-01-26

Reeve shows how Palestinian fanatcism, Israeli defiance and German police incompotence led to the tragedy.  He also gives the background stories of the victims, putting a face to the names of the dead.  The story is played out across a canvass of the Arab-Israeli conflict, of which Reeve gives a good overview for the less informed.<br />The second half of the book, which focusses on the Isreali revenge operation called &quot;Wrath of God,&quot; is not as strong.  Though a vital part of the overall story, the book is too brief to give the proper treatment to the myriad of assassinations that follwed the disaster.  After a while it all starts to run together until both sides seem like a couple of warring mafia families.<br />Overall, Reeve is an excellent journalist and a good writer who knows how to tell a story.  And in this case, he has a sad story to tell indeed.	2001-01-23

Bill Pronzini's &quot;Night Freight&quot; was for me an introduction to him as an author.  I guess the best compliment I can pay is that I plan to seek him out again.  This is a collection of short stories published by the author over about a 30 year period.  Perhaps because of the length of time it covers, it is not as consistant as it could be.  Pronzini writes suspenseful mystery tales and some outright horror stories, though the former tend to be more effective than the latter.  As a horror writer he is fairly conventional, without the imaginative flair of say, Stephen King.  Nevertheless, there are some memorable shocks such as &quot;Peekaboo&quot; which are sure to keep you up at night.  The mystery stories are better, particularly the single entry in his &quot;Nameless Detective&quot; series that appears here as well as the almost novella length &quot;Stacked Deck&quot; that kicks things off.<br />Overall, this is a hard collection to categorize, but lovers of both mystery and horror writing should find plenty of nuggets to enjoy.	2001-01-23

General Sherman was a visionary whose tactics against civilians and infastructure in Georgia and the Carolinas helped speed the war to its conclusion.  Of course, the human cost was high, but not by 20th Century standards in which this type of warfare would become the norm.  Furthermore, the South NEEDED to be whipped as Sherman whipped them to avoid the type of &quot;stab in the back&quot; mentality that showed up in Germany after World War I and led directly to Hitler.  Sherman's March left the South with no illusions about who won the war and about exactly what kind of Hell the war was.  Sherman himself said that &quot;War is misery and you cannot refine it,&quot; and he endeavored to bring that misery to the heretofore relatively untouched deep South.<br />Burke does a good job of showing the grave damage inflicted by the march and holds Sherman accountable for the excesses inflicted by his army.  He also shows how Sherman's tactics contributed greatly to the end of the conflict in part by causing many of the men in General Lee's command to desert.  The march was a work of military genius, and Davis has documented it in fine fashion.	2001-01-16

Author Jeffiner Niven conducted extensive research, helped by the fact that several of the survivors kept extensive journals during their ordeal.  Though they did not resort to cannibalism to stay alive, they endured most of the other hazzards of becoming stranded far from civilzation.  Starvation, snowblindness, severe frostbite, heartbreaking deaths, the crew of the &quot;Karluk&quot; endured them all.  Niven is a superior storyteller who has the ability to place the reader with the her protagonists.<br />The story has also includes a glimpse into the darker side of humanity.  The &quot;Karluk&quot; became stranded in the first place because of the arrogance and incompotence of the explorer Stefasson, who then proceeded to abandon her and her crew to their fate.  Fortunately, hero Captain Robert Bartlett was able to endure the almost superhuman ordeal of walking out of the wilderness and summoning help.  Even so, near half of the expedition expired in the ice, and some of those who survived behaved far less than honorably.<br />Overall, this is a great book for those interested in exploration or adventure stores.	2001-01-11

Along the way, Nick bares his soul more completely than do most first person narrative P.I.'s.  His stories are also among the most darkly violent and gritty that I've come across in the genre.  &quot;Nick's Trip&quot; is better than &quot;A Firing Offense,&quot; the first Stefanos book, if only because it is more plausible and more focussed.  Along the way, Nick reunites with an old friend who has become an obnoxious yuppie and whose wife has disappered.  He also manages to lose his girlfriend and become a surrogate father.  The whole book has an overwhelming feeling of lonliness to it, like a late night country song.  It is definately NOT for readers of light mainstream fiction.<br />Overall, a must read for fans of authors such as James Crumley and Andrew Vachss and anyone else who likes their P.I. fiction truly hard boiled.	2001-01-11

Paul Wilson's classic novel &quot;The Tomb&quot; was his only full length Repairman Jack novel.  Now he has added three more in three years, and as a result his protagonist is becoming overexposed.  The ending of &quot;The Tomb&quot; seemed to imply that Jack was going to die from wounds he sustained battling a supernatural creature called a Rakosh.  Now the creature is back as the centerpiece of an initially clever plot in which a Serbian gangster and some desperate molecular biologists are conspiring to get rich with a new designer drug that is causing mayhem in the streets.  All of this sounds exciting, and it is to a point.  But Wilson ultimately fails to capitalize upon his great setup.  Jack has been reduced here from a tortured soul who moves through the underworld to just another action hero.  And yet again, the holdover characters of Gia and Vicky from &quot;The Tomb&quot; serve absolutely no purpose other than to give Jack a vulnerability that is not especially plausible.  Also, Wilson is becoming increasingly heavy handed with his libertarian conservative political viewpoints.<br />It is unfortunate to say, but with each novel, Repairman Jack becomes less interesting as a character.  Turns out Wilson may have been right initially to be economical about using his best character.  By overexposing him he is in fact devaluing him.	2001-01-06

Books	4	6	6	N	N	This book is Not Depressing	&quot;No Depression&quot; the book is a collection of highlights from the first three years of &quot;No Depression&quot; magazine (roughly 1995-1997), which is the bible of the so-called &quot;Alternative Country&quot; music movement.  Personally, I am a big fan of the music and own CDs by roughly half of the three dozen or so featured artists.  The articles include written snapshots of such alt. country luminaries as Son Volt, Wilco, Blue Mountain, Steve Earle, Bottle Rockets and Whiskeytown.  The articles are reprinted verbatum from the magazine and there are no updates for features written several years before the book was published.  Unlike the magazine, there are unfortunately no photographs.<br />Overall, the writing and reporting are of high quality.  &quot;No Depression&quot; allows you to get to know artists who the mainstream music press have largely ignored.  That said, it is rather limited in its scope.  I would also have enjoyed a CD review section, but all you get instead is a list of the best 101 alt. country CDs of all time as picked by the editors of the magazine.  While the book isn't perfect, it is still a good read for those of us who love the music.	2001-01-04

It is an event that took on new life in the public eye in the 1990s with the supposed identification of a little girl's body who was body never claimed.  This is an exhaustive account, which is one of the book's weaknesses.  Author Stewart O'Nan tells the story from the viewpoints of many different survivors, often shifting perspective from paragraph to paragraph.  And while this style allows many voices to be heard, it is often confusing to the reader.  A myriad of names appear in the narritive and it is easy to lose track of which story you are following.  As a result, the victims tend to blur into a mass of humanity instead of maintaining their own identity.  Additionally, while the accounts of the fire itself is quite riveting, the later chapter focussing on the aftermath are far less so.<br />Overall, this is a good book for disaster buffs, but casual readers are likely to find it less enjoyable.	2001-01-04

And when an epic dust storm enshrouds the city, their time has come.  McCammon has created a fast-paced nerve tingling story that along with Stephen King's &quot;Night Shift&quot; and Skipp and Spector's &quot;The Light at the End&quot; is among the best of the modern graphic vampire stories.

In fact, private detective fiction seldom gets more hardboiled or as down and dirty as this one.  Crumley's &quot;hero,&quot; the recently unemployed private snoop Milo, is a man shattered by a terrible upbringing and by alcohol.  But despite his cynical and distrustful nature, he takes a case he knows will be a loser in a last ditch effort to both redeem himself and to find love.  The results are about what you would expect.<br />Milo is a completely different character than Crumley's other private detective hero C.W. Sughrue, the party animal star of &quot;The Last God Kiss&quot; among others.  Milo has been scarred far deeper by life and fully expects to lose himself to his addictions at some point.  His best friends are homeless winos with one foot firmly planted in their graves.  Brooding, violent and with a perfectly shocking ending, &quot;The Wrong Case&quot; is one of THE great hardboiled detective novels.	2000-12-25

For example, McPherson spends nearly the first three hundred pages of the book on the events, political and otherwise, leading up to the firing on Fort Sumter.  As a result, his book gives the war a proper context that is lacking in many other works.  His descriptions of the battles themselves tend to be brief overviews rather than extensive studies.  But there are countless other volumes by other authors available for those whose interest primarily lies with the shooting war itself.  McPherson would rather focus on why the North ans South decided to fight it out and once they did, how the war evolved slowly from an attempt to put down an insurrection to a holy quest to end slavery.<br />No other period in American History has seen as many political changes of earthquake proportions as The Civil War.  This fact often gets lost in the tales of epic battles, almost mythical generals and incredible sacrifice.  What McPherson has done is place the great painting of the war in a proper frame to give one the whole picture.  As such, it is vital reaading for anyone interested in the War and its effect on American History.	2000-12-17

Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack series has a complex and occasionally violent storyline worthy as a sequel to the great 1984 novel &quot;The Tomb.&quot;  Unlike the former novel, however, this one does not take a supernatural turn.  Instead it unfolds like a highly unconventional private detective tale, with plenty of twists and turns along the way.  As a tarnished white knight operating on the wrong side of the law, Jack is similar to Andrew Vachss's classic character Burke.  My only quibble with the novel is that the characters of Gia and Vicky, the mother and daughter Jack saved in &quot;The Tomb&quot; are held over here but add little if anything to the story.  With all that he's been through, Jack ought to be far too emotionally shattered to ever form a stable relationship.  This aspect of the novel goes nowhere, other than to provide Jack with some highly unlikely domestric tranquility.<br />Nevertheless, fans of &quot;The Tomb&quot; will find plenty to like, especially in the unique ways that Jack finds to defeat his adversaries.  As such, it is another winner for Wilson.	2000-12-17

It will also be the last of his books I ever read.  I am an ardent fan of end-of-the-world fiction, from &quot;On the Beach&quot; to &quot;The Stand,&quot; and this is one of the worst I've read.  If Dickson wanted to write a book about a symbiotic relationship between a man and a wolf, why did he have to &quot;destroy&quot; civilization to do it?  This book crawls at a snail's pace.  There is little of the epic descriptions of society's breakdown that make the best of the genre so good.  In fact, this story is SO conventional that it is almost laughably quaint.  Not to mention the fact that the doomsday scenario (a house-of-cards financial collapse trigged by the failure of an international banking conglomorate) has since been proven by the Lippo Group failure to be unrealistic.<br />Fans of Dickson, you can have him.  Apocalypse fiction fans should look elsewhere.  I'd start with &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; myself.	2000-12-10

Pinder's book claims to be &quot;Adventures in the worst weather in the world.&quot;  Actually, its a description of the weather he personally experiences as an observer on Mt. Washington, which is only interesting to a point.  The rest of the weather stories are second hand and poorly told at that.  Linder has the annoying habit of repeating himelf and his narrative wanders without any logical progression.  But the worst thing I caught was his perpetuating the totally false myth that meteorologist Issac Cline rode up and down the beach on horseback to warn Galveston residents about the approach of the 1900 hurricane.  I would have thought that the excellent bestseller &quot;Issac's Storm&quot; had laid that blatantly false story to rest once and for all.  For someone whose life is supposed to be weather, this glaring inaccuracy made me question the validity of Pinder's entire book.<br />Even weather-philes should be wary of this poorly written work.  It simply is not what it purports to be.  For me, it was a HUGE disappointment.	2000-12-10

Crumley's vivid detail, down-and-out characters and brief bursts of violence make his story as vivid as a Hank Williams tune.  His hero, C.W. Sughrue (&quot;Sugh&quot; as in &quot;sugar&quot; and rue as in &quot;rue the goddamned day&quot;) is everything a hardboiled detective ought to be; alcoholic, rebellious, cynical and beholden to no code of honor but his own.  The mystery itself unfolds in a bizarre and complex manner, leading to a payoff that you know won't be pretty.  It may take Crumley a bit too long to get there, but its a fun trip while it lasts.<br />Overall, a flawed but classic novel that fans of Andrew Vachss, George P. Pelecanos, Jonathan Valin and John D. MacDonald in particular ought to enjoy.	2000-12-10

Perhaps as a way of rebelling, he stumbles on a new profession, private detective.  Stefanos inhabits those potions of Washington D.C. that tourists never see.  The seedy neighborhoods, the wild club scene and the party culture.  Though the scene he describes has changed quite a bit since this book was first published (the clubs he mentions are for the most part long gone and WHFS radio has gone from hip to coporate bland), the prose is riveting and immediate.  Nick and his friends are people with problems, and just like real life, things are not going to turn out all right.  The violent climax is explosive; and then there's a slow fade, like the aftermath of a love act.<br />Overall, this is a fine introduction to a gritty private detective series that, so far, unfortunately only includes three novels.	2000-11-17

His story is very similar, a bunch of hardworking mariners (in this case the crew of a cruise ship rather than a fishing boat) who get caught at sea by a rare freak-of-nature storm that causes them to vanish virtually without a trace.  Carrier tells their stories as the tragedy unfolds.  He also gives a good account of the power of Hurricane Mitch, the second deadliest storm ever in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth most powerful hurricane ever recorded.  Carrier also provides a good account of the destruction of Honduras, which suffered catostrophic flooding and over 18,000 deaths.  In fact, if the book has a weakness it's that the story of the cruise ship get a bit too much preference over the greater disater that occurred on shore.<br />Carrier knows how to tell a story and his prose is riveting.  He places the reader right with his unfortunate protagonists.  And like &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; the book describes a unique seafaring way of life.  Fans of the other &quot;storm&quot; will love it.	2000-11-17

Pelacanos's hero, P.I. and bartender Nick Stefanos, is an alcoholic which is dramatically demonstrated by his harrowing bender as the book opens.  In his stupor he sort of, kind of, witnesses a murder and becomes obsessed about solving it.  Though not obssessed enough to quit drinking.  Along the way, he hooks up with fellow P.I. Jack LaDuke, who has a mess of psychological problems of his own.  The two form an unlikely pair, and as Pelecanos's riventing story unfolds, you know the ending will not be pretty.<br />This was my first book in this series, and I definately plan to read more.  Fans of Andrew Vachss's Burke series, in particular, should eat this stuff up.	2000-11-15

That said, this is one of the sorriest examples I've run across.  Though the subject matter is appropriate (teenage girl disappears into the world of underground flesh markets and ends up involved in a grisly murder), the hero, Harry James Denton, just ain't up to the material.  For example, would any self-respecting hardboiled P.I.:<br />1).  Nearly pass out from the sight of dead body?<br />2).  Describe a strip joint like a prude?<br />3).  Put up with a girlfriend bugging him to have a baby?<br />4).  Use politically correct terms like &quot;African American?&quot;<br />5).  Have THREE names, for crying out loud?<br />Not to mention the fact that the story, while told with some grusome detail, reads like an episode of &quot;Spencer For Hire.&quot;  The characters are stock and you can see the &quot;big secret&quot; coming about a hundred or so pages before the hero does.  Forget this one.	2000-11-10

Thubron travelled the Trans-Siberian railway and made other detours through Russia's &quot;Wild Wild East.&quot;  What he found mostly was a people who are perservering despite living in an immense scarcely populated land that seems cursed by history and memories of the gulags.  Some of Thubron's images are riveting and tragic.  But unfortunately, his prose leaves a lot to be desired.  He often writes in an off-putting second person, and he sometimes lingers on subjects that are just not that interesting.  He also provides little context for his journey.  He makes little mention of what compelled him to go to Siberia at this particular time, nor does he give any buildup for his travels or reflect on what it means to him.  Worse yet, at the end of the book you get no sense of a journey completed.  Instead, Thubron simply stopped writing.<br />Overall, this book was a great disappointment.  I would recommend searching out Benson Bobrick's superior history of Siberia, &quot;East of the Sun&quot; instead.	2000-11-08

With &quot;Super Casino,&quot; he tracks the careers of men like Steve Wynn and Bill Bennett, whose vision helped transform the Las Vegas Strip from a haven for mobsters and high rollers to literally an adult Disneyland suitable for the whole family.  While one might question the morality of the casinos, one has to admire the audacity of the entreprenuers who keep building them ever larger and more grand.  Earley shows how over the last quarter century gambling (or gaming, as its now called) has lost a lot of its negative stigma and how big time investment bankers have pushed the mob out of the casino racket.  Earley also makes some attempts to show a balanced account of the downside of legalized gambling on a massive scale.  Like any good journalist, he lets the reader make the moral judgements.<br />Overall, the is an interesting and well-written book that will captivate anyone drawn to this subject matter.	2000-11-08

Also presented are the dawn of modern psychoanalysis and the birth of the notion of the serial killer.  All of this narrative fabric is expertly woven by Carr, who perfectly captures the feel of life in the Big Apple at the turn of the last century for all of its modernistic glory and all of its decadence.

Right from the start, his writing reminds you of Raymond Chandler, though more vivid and descriptive.  But Phillip Marlowe never had to worry about ending up in a concentration camp and that threat gives the first two novels in this series even more of an edge.  Kerr creates a dead on accurate feel for what it was like to live in Nazi Germany before the outbreak of the war.  Like all good historical fiction, famous names grace the pages as minor characters, including Goering and Renhard Heydrich.  Their appearances give the books weight, but Kerr is careful not to overdo it.  Fans of Caleb Carr's superb novel &quot;The Alienist&quot; in particular should love this series as well as anyone with an interest in Nazi Germany.	2000-10-17

But the latest was a bit of a disappointment.  Vachss was apparently aiming for a dramatic change in the series.  But unfortunately after a great opening in which Burke is shot, feigns amnesia in the hospital and makes a life-threatening escape, the book slows down, way down.  On the plus side, the attempt on his life causes Burke to do some serious soul searching, which provides more insight into his damaged psyche.  Unfortunately, the great set up fails to pay off on its high expectations.  The story slows to a crawl during the search, and never really gets going again.  Burke's latest femme fatale, the Cambodian Gem, is an interesting character but only about average for the series.  The climatic confrontation, usually the strength of any Burke novel, is disappointing.<br />Overall, I rank this entry in the Burke saga near the bottom with &quot;Down in the Zero&quot; and &quot;Footsteps of the Hawk.&quot;  It isn't bad, but it isn't as good as it should have been.	2000-10-14

Paul Jeffers's biography of Grover Cleveland is readable, but I found myself thinking of the famous Walter Mondale phrase, &quot;Where's the Beef?&quot;  Checking in at a brief 350 pages, made all the shorter by the interspersion of photographs throughout the text, this book is a good bare bones account of Cleveland's life in which the reader never really gets to know the man.  Cleveland is a vastly underrated President, mostly because didn't serve at a time of great national crisis.  So the recent interest in him (no less than two biographies published in 2000) is a good thing.  Jeffers's book did much to enlighten me, but left me wanting more.  I also found a couple of glaring factual errors.  Overall, Jeffers's book is a good introduction to its subject, and that's probably all most casual readers will want to know.	2000-10-02
2265358:US	51809405	R21UG5S1OW3CMU	0133144763	593731887	55 days: The fall of South Vietnam	Books	4	10	11	N	N	First rate journalistic account of the end of the War	Alan Dawson is an excellent journalist who covered the fall of Saigon from the city itself.  Not surprisingly, he is highly critical of the U.S. leadership that failed to get a large number of its Vietnamese employees out during the chaotic evacuation.  He is also highly critical of the corrupt South Vietnamese regime that squandered billions of dollars in American aid and ultimately sacrificed their country to the communists almost without a fight.  I would recommend this book over &quot;The Fall of Saigon&quot; which is far less readable.	2000-09-29

Unlike other instances where this has occurred, however, Bulger managed to corrupt his FBI handlers as they aided and abetted his twenty year crime spree.  Authors Lehr and O'Neill know this story well, having covered it for many years with the local Boston newspapers.  It is a good lesson in what can happen to anyone, especially a law enforcement officer, when little indescretions lead to major breaches in ethics.  What the book does not have enough of, unfortunately, are first hand descriptions of the mobsters plying their trade.  There is some of it in the book, but most of the stories are second hand.  Unlike other notable recent mob stories, like &quot;Wise Guy&quot; and &quot;Underboss,&quot; the focus is not on mob life itself.  Overall, I found the book to be about a hundred pages or so too long, though still an interesting read for anyone who like real life crime stories.	2000-09-25

Anyone who has read previous Burke novels knows that this type of work is right up his alley.  Along the way he hooks up with another exotic femme fatale in Crystal Beth, one of Burke's more interesting leading ladies.  Andrew Vachss's writing reads like broken glass and barbed wire with its sharp cutting edges.  He also knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat.  His stories are hardboiled rather than fast paced and they have a strong moral center that would not be obvious to the average square.  Vachss is simply one of the best &quot;detective&quot; fiction writers working today.	2000-09-25

Green is a third-tier broadcast analyst for NFL games on television and he is clearly still far too indebted to the league to be truly critical of it.  Every time you thinks he's strating to get to the good stuff, he pulls his punch and lets the league off the hook.  The result is a wishy-washy mish-mash of some gossipy dirty laundry being aired without any information truly damaging to the league's powers that be.  And might I add this; as a writer, Green is a lightweight.  Rarely in this book does his prose rise above the level of the barely compotent.	2000-09-21

The authors uncover a number of excellent tales about  the committed spooks and blue collar sailors who were truly on the front  lines during this period.  Their missions, including tailing Soviet subs,  tapping Soviet undersea cables and monitoring Soviet nuclear tests rode the  fine line between bravery and foolhardiness.  Throughout the book the  question keeps popping up, were some of these outlandish tactics worth the  benefit to our national security?  The authors, to their credit, are  content to let the reader decide.<br />The best recommendation for the book I  can give is from a friend of a friend who is a sub commander.  He  recommended it when asked how one might begin to understand the mindset it  takes to do what he does.	2000-09-08

The story is at once  compelling and terrifying.  The only knock on the book is that Padfield  pads his narritive by including many events in Nazi Germany that did not  necessarily involve Himmler.  But though a more concise biography might  have been more readable, this is still a riveting account for those with an  interest in Nazi Germany.	2000-09-01

As such, the quality of the  book varies greatly with the quality of the articles.  The best usually are  the intenionally humorous pieces about topics as varied the death of  drive-in movie theaters and the joys of American junk food.  The worst  articles come mostly when Bryson takes to his soap box and goes on one of  his left wing tangents.  The political ideas he exposes are those of a  standard liberal bleeding heart and are not at all original.  And for him  to put Kennedy on his list of our greatest Presidents and leave out Truman  is laughable.  Overall, there is some good Bryson material here, but the  whole is inconsistent.	2000-08-28

His travel writings remind me of a left wing  P.J. O'Rourke.  Of the three books of his I have read, &quot;A Walk in the  Woods&quot; is easilly the best because it is by far the most humorous and  it has the best subject matter.  Bryson's attempt to walk the whole of the  Appalachain Trail may have been a fool's errand on his part, but it makes  for a great adventure tale.  Along the way, Bryson describes much what is  best (and worst) about America.  His self-deprecating style keeps things  light, even when he occasionally gets up on his soapbox.  This book should  be read by anyone with an interest in the outdoors.	2000-08-28

For one thing, the narrative ark takes some twists and turns into some  unusal, but not at all together satisfying directions.  For another,  several key moments in the plot are based on non-too-plausible scenes of  the hero overhearing conversations of his adversaries.  Some of the action  scenes are not terribly believable, and the ending of the book reads like a  cliched Western.  Nevertheless, Brin does pack his novel with a number of  interersting ideas and notions that at least make it worth reading for  those with an interest in this particular genre.	2000-08-18

The action hinges on the a father taking revenge after his preteen daughter  is raped.  This is a disgusting enough theme, but then the reader is made  to believe that such vigilantism is not only justified but perfectly  acceptable!  At the end of the book, a court ruling is made based on the  threat of mob violence.  If that isn't enough to chill your blood, all of  this is in service of a weak story with cliche characters and an overall  lack of imagination that is startling.

I too read this book as a junior high schooler in the late 1970s and found its ultra violent football theme  similar to movies such as &quot;Rollerball&quot; and &quot;Soylent  Green.&quot;  Sci-fi was a lot more downcast in those days.  Anyway, I  remember the book as an exciting read (with a flashlight under the blanket,  for it was past my bedtime) that I had a hard time putting down.

His storytelling talent shows through in his classic account of the sinking  of the Titanic.  The book's only flaw is its brevity.  The narrative  portion is only 135 pages in small paperback form and starts just as the  ship is about to hit the iceberg.  There is no background story to give the  reader perspective of the ship's construction or of the passengers whose  stories it follows.  Also lacking is much detail about the aftermath of the  sinking.  The actual sinking is retold in riveting first person accounts  that detail those fatal final moments and all of their tragedies and  ironies.  In fact, Lord's account was good enough to make me want to seek  out a more complete history of the disaster.	2000-08-16

Seal's adventures take him to  Africa in search of survivors of the notorious Black Mamba, to India in  search of the King Cobra, to Austrailia which has the world's deadliest  snake in the Taipan and to Appalachian U.S., where Holiness Church members  handle live rattlesnakes as part of their services.  The most memorable  sequences are the horrifying experience of a preacher's wife whose husband  tried to murder her by forcing her to put her hands in a rattlesnake cage  and the graphic descriptions of the effects of Taipan poison as recounted  by a lucky survivor.  The only knock on the book is that Seal chooses to  break each segment up into about five parts which are interspersed  throughout the book.  This makes the stories sometimes hard to follow.  Nevertheless, it is compelling reading that might have you checking under  your bed before turning out the light at night.	2000-08-10

Yes, the title character is working undercover on the  beaches of L.A. when a millionaire asks him to kill him.  But the story  goes in a much different (and more believable) direction.

Still there are some  problems, like the flubbing of some basic facts (as basic as, for example,  getting the name wrong of fellow patriot George Mason's home, which is  today a National Historical Site).  The other major flaw I noted was that  Randall gives only about 30 pages of text to Washington's presidency, while  his pre-Revolution military career gets something on the order of three  times the space.  I don't know whether this reflects a lack of research on  Randall's part, but Washington's two terms get only a bare bones treatment.  Nevertheless, I always judge historical biographies by how much the teach  me about their subject and I did learn a lot.  Enough, in fact, to wonder  how much the author may have left out.	2000-08-08

The theme, that  someone is making random $100,000 deposits on the doorsteps of every home  in small communities around the country and creating havoc in the process,  is quite fascinating (though admittedly dated, it would probably be about  $250,000 today).  It is a mystery worthy of the great Inspector Flynn, and  is told in a humorous style for which McDonald is known.  Overall, a great  book for fans of detective fiction.	2000-08-08

His unflattering portrait of how movies get made probably angered more than  a few of Hollywood's elite.  Nevertheless, the book is weakened by his  inclusion of THE ENTIRE SCREENPLAY that he wrote for the movie &quot;Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,&quot; all 150 pages of it.  He presents a  critique of the screenplay as well for the aspiring screenwriter.  Nevertheless, as a non-aspiring screenwriter, the screenplay had no value  to me.  Nevertheless, though a bit dated, Goldman's book is essential for  anyone interested in how Hollywood works.  It is not, as you might expect,  a pretty picture.	2000-08-08

The vivid and sickening first person accounts  should cause any reader to question whether resorting to nuclear force is  ever justified.  In my mind, the bombs dropped on Japan WERE justified  because of Japanese war atrocities, the tremendous casualties the allies  would have suffered from an invasion of the Japanese home islands and  because before the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, no one knew for sure what it  would do.  The horror of Hiroshima and Nakasaki is partly responsible, I  think, for the fact that no atomic weapons have been used in warfare since  then.  The images in this book will stay with you long after you've put it  down.	2000-08-06

Andre Trudeau focusses on the  three month period April-June 1865, carrying the narrative of the War from  the fall of Richmond to the last skirmish in Texas (a Confederate victory).  Along the way, he retells many important stories that seem lost to  history, like the Sultana explosion, the deadliest naval disaster in U.S.  history than claimed the lives of nearly 1700 people, most of them  returning Union POWs.  Overall, this is an interesting historical account  that should appeal to those with an interest in the Civil War.	2000-08-06

Unfortunately, it ultimate is pretty depressing.  That an  intelligent guy like Belushi could fail to see where he was headed and  waste his tremendous talent is good lesson about the hazards of fame.  &quot;Live fast die young and leave a good looking corpse,&quot; so the  quote goes.  Belushi wasn't the first or last show-biz star to live his  life by that mantra.  And his story is probably fairly representative of  stars from Jim Morrison to River Phoenix.<br />One note:  the book  &quot;Wired&quot; is far, far superior to the travesty of a movie it later  became.	2000-08-06

Alas, it is not to be.  &quot;The Brethren&quot; is a fairly conventional by-the-numbers account of  the Nixon-Ford era Supreme Court that tries to drum up tension from such  incidents as the movement to impeach the aged Justice William O. Douglas,  but ultimately fails.  The secretive world of the court would be difficult  for any journalist to penetrate, and here Woodward and his cohort Armstrong  prove themselves not to be up to the task.<br />A word about this book's  availability.

Every year since  the end World War Two, the bravest (and foolhardiest) of Austrailia's  sailors set out on this epic race on the day after Christmas.  Prior to  1998, there had luckily been few fatalities.  Unfortunately, that year the  racers' luck ran out and an unexpected hurricane strength storm (a  &quot;weather bomb&quot; as the author describes it) descended on the race,  killing six people.  The storm left an aftermath of wrecked boats and  caused the largest seas rescue effort in Austrailian history.  That more  sailors didn't perish was simply a matter of pure luck with some assistance  from modern technology.<br />The only drawback of this book is Dugard's  sometimes overly dramatic prose which diminishes rather than enhances his  story.  Otherwise, anyone with an interest in real life sea adventure  stories will love this book.	2000-08-06

When they  were assigned to cover a &quot;fourth rate burglary&quot; at the Watergate  Hotel, it changed the course of their careers and of American History.  It  is no exaggeration that had more conventional Washington political  reporters been assigned to the Watergate story, it might never have been  exposed in enough detail to bring down Richard Nixon.  This book is an  American classic.  Though it lacks historical perspective on the Watergate  affair, it is vital to anyone who wants to understand the greatest American  political crisis of the Post World War Two era.	2000-08-06

This was the bloodiest period of the army's history, with more than half  of all of its casualties occurring with the last year of the fighting.  Catton recounts all of the great battles that helped end the war, from The  Wilderness through the tragedy of Cold Harbor to the siege of Petersburg  and finally to Appomattox Court House.  Along the way, he documents the  military genius of Ulysses S. Grant, with whom the Army of the Potomac  finally had a commander with the ability and the perserverance to win the  war.  Catton is one of the best Civil War historians, and this is the  author at his finest.	2000-08-06

For some  reason, Korea has just never registered with Americans the way World War  Two or Vietnam has.  But the stakes were high as America rushed its  untrained Pacific army from Japan to the Korean peninsula in a desperate  attempt to forestall a communist takeover of the South in 1950.  The  heroism of those first soldiers cannot be understated.  Hastings captures  the whole saga of the war as a horrible tragedy and as the first test of  the West's determination to literally fight the spread of communism.  Ultimately, as Hastings points out, the sacrifice of the allied troops was  not in vain.  That democracy exists today in South Korea is a testement to  those who fought and died to preserve the country's freedom.	2000-08-03

But this reads like it was written for a junior college  creative writing class.  The characters are cliches, the action isn't  terribly compelling and the apocalypse scenario at the beginning of the  book is a total snore compared to others in the genre.  An early example of  the book's inadequacy as a story has the hero, a mere moments from seeing  everything and everyone he knows destroyed in the Florida Keys, thinking  about he's going to escape to the Arkansas mountains where a he and a  friend bought land anticipating exactly the scenerio he finds himeself in.  If he and his friend were so smart, what were they doing living in the  Florida Keys in the first place?  Overall, a very poorly written book that  failed to hold my interest until even the halfway mark.	2000-08-03

It delves into the politics that led to the war, the  U.S. attempt at mediation between its two allies and, of course, the actual  fighting.  The whole affair seems a bit surreal as it also must have to the  British soldiers who fought there.  The Falklands themselves, as remote and  windswept as it is possible for any inhabited location on Earth to be, were  hardly worth all the trouble.  But for both Britain and Argentina, national  pride and honor were at stake.  The irony is that by invading the islands,  Argentina's military leadership made it less likely that the country will  ever gain possession of them.  This book is a good tribute to the men who  fought what will probably be the last colonial war, and it is well written  historical account.	2000-08-03

Books	4	26	31	N	N	P.J. is the man	&quot;Holidays in Hell&quot; was the first book to collect the travel  writings of P.J. O'Rourke for Rolling Stone magazine.  Though a bit dated  taday (these stories were from the mid 1980s) it is still quite funny and  full of classic P.J.  He establishes his mantra here, basically that if you  really want to know whats going on in a country you should never interview  its politicians who will never tell you the straight story.  In this book,  P.J. travels to Poland, Lebanon, Panama and Heritage U.S.A. among other  places.  But the best essay is called &quot;Through Darkest America: Epcot  Center&quot; that is an absolutely dead on drubbing of the so-called Magic  Kingdom.  Through it all O'Rourke reminds me of a more political and  funnier Bill Bryson.  This book is well worth a read.	2000-08-03

Ryan looks at the capture of  Berlin from both the Russian and German point of view.  He focusses on the  few heros on the German side (including Albert Speer) who did their duty  while attempting to save their country from Hitler's mad scheme of total  destruction.  Ryan vividly recounts the battle scenes through the eyes of  eyewitnesses.  Through it all is a mood of the utter hopelessness of a  people who knew they were beaten but were unable to make themselves stop  fighting.  Freed from the Cold War controversy of whether the U.S. forces  should have tried to beat the Russians to Berlin, this story can now be  enjoyed as a classic, and tragic, tale of an epic battle.	2000-08-03

Maier document's the country's  struggle to shrug off military dictatorship, its economic collapse, its  environmental catastrophes, its ethnic and religous violence and its  hopeless corruption.  Particularly surprising was the fact that a country  that is the world's sixth largest oil producer has to import gasloine  because of damage to its refineries and has experienced massive gasoline  shortages.  Maier also throws in a lot of historical material to provide  perspective.  The problem with the book is that he spends most of his time  interviewing various political and religous leaders (almost at random, it  seems, which makes the book confusing).  What I wanted more of was  descriptions of day to day living conditions in the country and interviews  with more average citizens.  As political travel writer and humorist P.J.  O'Rourke once said, you'll never find out what's really going on in a  country by interviewing its politicians.  Overall, this is an informative  book, but it is not as compelling a read as it should be given its subject  matter.	2000-08-02

While acknowledging that it is difficult to  convice worthy candidates to agree to run for the office that was once  described as &quot;not worth a bucket of warm spit,&quot; Whitcover argues  that Presidential candidates have a duty to the country to try and select  the best available individual.  Unfortunately, political considerations  often stand in the way, as was the case with Qualye.  Whitcover's book is  informative and very enlightening.  It is also quite relevant as another  Presidential campaign heads for the home stretch.	2000-08-02

However, as a science fiction story, what may have been riveting in the early 1950s  seems a bit tame by today's standards.  Particularly interesting is  Bradbury's vision of the evolution of television, which of course was still  in its infancy at the time he wrote the story.  The idea of a room in which  the visual image surrounds you on all sides sounds a projection screen TV  owner's fantasy.  Bradbury's vision of a totalitarian society is as scary  as anything out of &quot;1984,&quot; but ultimately Bradley was mistaken in  believing that television could pacify the masses for totalitarianism.  In  fact, instant communications has made a totalitarian government, which  relies on total control of information, less likely.  The book is brief,  checking in at a quickly read 160 pages.  And this edition features a  couple of scenes Bradbury wrote later on that were not featured in the  original novel.	2000-08-01

The hero, Brion, is a young man given his first opportunity to  prove his worthiness by trying to save Dis, a horrible planet that seems  hell bent on self destruction.  Harrison's imagination fills the page with  sweeping scenery, even though the book checks in at a relatively snappy 160  or so pages.  It is proof that epic science fistion does not need to go one  for many volumes ala L. Ron Hubbard.	2000-07-30

But what is striking about this story is the amazing amount of  mutual cooperation among the survivors, most of whom were in their late  teens and early twenties.  That they managed for the most part to retain  their civilized natures in the wake of utter hopelessness and through  working together devised a workable plan to effect their own rescue is  nothing short of remarkable.

Most of the story takes place on Earth in the middle of the next century, but on an artificially created island called &quot;Stateless&quot;  that is diplomatically shunned by most of the rest of the world because of  how it was created.  On the island, a convention is gathering to decide on  the new &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; which is supposed to be as  revolutionary as the Theory of Relativity.  Lurking in the background is a  new psychological malady named Distress, which is somehow linked to these  events.

Journalist David Simon spent a year as  a fly on the wall observing the Balitimore Police Homicide Unit, and  dutifully recording everything he saw by and large without editorial  comment.  The result is absolutely indespensible for anyone with an  interest in law enforcement.  Being a homicide detectives is a tough job  both emotionally and professionally with many hours of tedium that can  often result in the frustration of an unsolved case.  Particularly poignant  is the story of a unsolved child murder case that haunts one of the  detectives to the point of endagering his mental well being.  The value of  this book to the nation's hard working law enforcement professionals simply  cannot be understated.	2000-07-28

And he deserves our admiration for subjecting himself to a year spent as a corrections officer in one of the country's  most notorious prisons.  In doing so, he reveals that being a corrections  officer is one of the toughest and most unappreciated jobs around.  The  damage the job does to the psyche of the men and women who do it as well as  the disruptions in their personal lives is starkly documented in his  account.  The author also make an excellent point in wondering why we are  filling our prisons with so many non-violent (primarily drug) offenders.  My only quibble is that Conover occasionally goes a bit to far afield with  his liberal comments.  By and large, violent offenders are undserving of  our sympathy no matter what horrific environment may have helped to create  them.  Nevertheless, the book presents for the most part a balanced view of  the life of a corrections officer.  For that it is a valuable read for  anyone interested in criminology.	2000-07-28

This would be the second.  Like Simon, Harvey Rachlin makes a strong  effort to get the story right as he follows a New York City police officer  as he is chosen to be elevated from the uniform ranks to breathe the  rarified air of the detective's squadroom.  Detective Dave Carbone deserves  cresit for allowing Rachlin to scrutinize him so closely.  Like Simon,  Rachlin is mostly interested in how law enforcement professionals do what  they do.  Also like Simon, after reading Rachlin's account you'll have a  much greater appreciation for those who try to keep our streets and  neighborhoods safe for the law abiding.	2000-07-28

These were guys whose  genius made them wealthy beyond most people's wildest imaginations, but for  whom enough was never enough.  Stewart is a first rate journalist and  having worked for the Wall Street Journal, he came to be intimately  familiar with the particular villians and the heroic agents and prosecutors  who caught them.

The same  drive that made Bill Watterson perhaps the most brilliant cartoonist ever  caused him to pull the plug on his beloved creations when he thought that  he had given it all he could give.

For a travel writer, I suppose this is a must.  He's also a humorist, and I laughed out loud on at least a half a dozen  occasions while enjoying his adventures down under.  Particularly amusing  were his descriptions of a Cricket match, of a particularly bad hotel in  Darwin and and of a drunken night in the Outback.  He also gives a fine  overall view of Austrailia, of which he covered much, but alas not nearly  as much as he wanted.  Though some might gripe that he spends too much time  ruminating over the poisonous wildlife and looking for a cold beer, overall  this is an exceptionally fun book to read.  He includes many historical  facts about Australia and even devotes some space to the unfortunate  condition of the Aborigines.  But not too much to spoil the fun.  Bryson's  travel writings remind me of an apolitical P.J. O'Rourke, and for that he's  worth a read.	2000-07-25

Witcover  is a excellent journalist and a fine writer.  He chronicles the chaos of  the 1976 campaign on the Democratic side and shows how a determined  darkhorse named Jimmy Carter was able to outlast his many rivals in part by  getting an early jump start on them.  He also documents the bitter  nomination fight between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford that almost tore the  Republican party apart.  Lastly, there is the general election in which  Carter started with a huge lead and blundered his way into winning by the  closest margain of any election since 1960.  This is an excellent book for  politics junkies.	2000-07-25

In this episode, Detective Steve Carella attempts to track down a psycho who has killed the cousin of a fifteen year old girl  right in front of her eyes.  Just when Carella thinks he has a positive ID,  it turns out to be the wrong guy!  This book is typically of earlier period  McBain. It is short, sweet and to the point, describing matter-of-factly  how a murder investigation works.  It is not the most memorable of McBain's  works, but will satisfy any fan of the 87th Precinct series.	2000-07-25

This is the format that all later period 87th Precinct books would follow.  There are a  total of four plots in this one, each investigated by a different detective  from the precinct.  A murder, a suicide, a jewel heist and a bombing each  get their due treatment.  This is one of the better entries in the 87th  Precinct series and a must read for any McBain fan.	2000-07-25

Burke Davis is a first rate writer and historian and  focusses here on Washington the General who led America to military victory  in the Revolutionary War despite long odds and much personal hardship.  Just keeping his ragtag army together was enough of a challenge.  To  actually win battles such as Trenton and Yorktown and survive the treachery  of Benedict Arnold makes him all the more remarkable.  It is a shame that  the Revolutionary War evokes little of the passion in Americans today that  the Civil War does.  Washington's military feats dwarf those of Grant, Lee  and Sherman.  With this book, Washington the military commander gets his  due.	2000-07-22

Mussolini was no Hitler.  Even had he desired it, he could never have established totalitarianism in  Italy as the temperment of the Italian people simply would not have allowed  it.  Instead he was sort of like the neighborhood bully elevated to power.  Threatening yes, but not truly evil.  Had World War Two not happened, his  fate probably would have been more similar to Spain's Franco, whose regime  died of natural causes with him.  The most interesting aspect of  Mussolini's life was his transistion from socialism to fascism, but even  this can be viewed as opportunism from a man with no real political  convictions other than obtaining and maintaining power.  Overall, this is a  good introdution to the man who in the end got what he deserved from his  own people.	2000-07-22

The Juneau disaster is  probably best known because among the many deaths were five brothers who  had joined the navy at the start of World War Two and insisted that they be  assigned to the same ship.  Only one of the brothers survived the initial  sinking, and he tragically succcomed to dehydration and delirium while  frantically searching for his siblings on the open ocean amidst the oil and  debris from the wreck.  Equally compelling is the story of how the  commander of The Juneau's task force made a life and death decision to  leave the survivors behind in the water lest he put his other ships at  risk.  As a result only a mere handful of sailors ultimately survived.  Their story is as haunting as anything I've read.	2000-07-22

Fred Coleman's book is much more abstract, focussing on root historical causes rather than reports from the field as  events happened.  Coleman's main argument in the book, that the West could  have forced the collapse of the Soviet Union through a more agressive  foreign policy as early as the mid 1950s, is the most controversal argument  he makes.  Coleman believes that Hungary and later Czechoslovakia could  have been freed from Soviet clutches in 1956 and 1967 respectively had the  West only shown a willingness to flex its military muscle.  Coleman argues  that the Soviet military was always a paper tiger and that Soviet leaders  were merely bluff an bluster.  The only problem with this argument is that  had the West followed Coleman's course of action, nuclear anihilation may  have resulted.  Still, this is a worthwhile book for those interested in  the Cold War and how the Soviets lost it.	2000-07-22

Germany's leading arms manufacturer used slave labor to keep the nation's armies supplied, and  didn't particularly care whether the slaves lived or died.  The conditions  were atrocious.  If a worker died on the factory floor, the body was  carried out and another slave put in its place.  They were starved, beaten  and ultimately had no hope of survival short of Germany's defeat.  The most  surprising thing is that Alfred Krupp, the President of the company during  this period, was not only released a mere three years after his conviction  at Nuremburg, but given his fortune and company back!  This has to rate as  one of the worst miscarriages of justice that occurred because of the Cold  War.  Manchester's book is lengthy, but very readble.  Overall, it shows  the profit motive at its most reprehensible.	2000-07-22

Instead, it was a boring account of the Carter administration's reaction to  the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis.  Sick worked for Carter when  the revolution helped turn the president's foreign policy program on its  head.  The hostage crisis more than any other event, contributed to  Carter's defeat in 1980.  Unfortunately, none of this makes for terribly  interesting reading.  The Iranian revolution is one of the most important  events in World History of the last quarter century.  But you would never  know that from reading this book.	2000-07-22

Author Robert Conot does a lot more than just recount the  trial of the leading Nazis.  He gives a full portrayal of their crimes and  details their actions while they were in allied custody both before and  during the trial.  Conot also gives the background on the leading allied  prosecutors and judges as well as detailing the increasing Cold War  friction that surrounded the trial.  The Nuremburg trial set the standard  for international war crimes tribunals as we know them today.  Many  precedents were established that are still with us.  But it is the  fascinating (and revolting) stories of the defendant's themselves that make  this book so compelling.	2000-07-22

Subsequent events have shown that  Russia was not through with Chechnya by a long shot.  This is a fascinating  and grusome account of how Russia first attempted to pacify its rebellious  province and how the Chechnyan hatred of the Russians goes back well over a  hundred years.  Stalin deported the entire population of the area to  Central Asia during World War Two, cementing the Checnyans hatred of  Moscow.  That the West has allowed the slaughter in Chechnya to continue  without more than a peep of a protest is shameful.  This is a compelling  book that deserves a wider audience, as well as a sequel.	2000-07-22

Shirer's classic &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; is the most complete single volume account of the history of Nazi Germany ever written.  Shirer was a journalist, not a historian and  the advantages of this show in his very readable prose and his vivid  descriptions (for example, often referring to Herman Goering as &quot;the  fat Field Marshall&quot;).  The book starts with the birth of the Nazi  party and how it found a spokesman early on in an ex-serviceman named Adolf  Hitler.  The narrative continues through until the end of the war, Hitler's  suicide and the final few days under Admiral Doenitz.  The only warning to  the casual reader is that the book's length exceeds 1100 pages and it is  crammed to the brim with facts.  Also, it should be noted that the book was  published over forty years ago and does not include more recent information  that has come to light from, for example, the former East German archives.  Nevertheless, this is still a classic work of jornalistic history.	2000-07-22

In Dan Kurzman, this event is given a storytelling  treatment worthy of the man who would soon become shark bait himself.  The  Indianapolis story is a horror not only because of what the survivors of  the sinking endured (dehydration, delirium and, of course, shark attacks),  but because of the bureaucratic bungling that caused them to be left in the  water for many days beyond when the sinking was first reported.  Granted  the war was in its last stages and important things were happening (the  Indianapolis was returning from having delivered the Atomic bomb that was  dropped on Hiroshima) but the neglect the ship's survivors received was  inexcusable.  Kurzman is an excellent journalist and writer.  This book and  &quot;Left to Die&quot; his account of the sinking of the USS Juneau, are  first rate accounts of nautical disaster.	2000-07-22

Actually, the fighting carried on for a couple more months and included many events, including General Joseph Johnson's surrender,  Lincoln's assassination, the flight of Jefferson Davis, a steamboat tragedy  on the Mississippi River, the final land battle in Texas (ironically, a  Confederate victory), the escape through Florida of several Confederate  political leaders including John Breckinridge and the continued plundering  of Union merchant shipping by a Confederte raider well into the fall of  1865.  Burke Davis chronicles all of this as well as Jefferson Davis's post  Civil War life as an unreconstructed rebel.  It is a fascinating read for  those interested in the Civil War.	2000-07-22

Thomas Wolfe's account of post war American test pilots and the first American astronauts is frank, amusing, moving and ultimately  triumphant.  Wolfe humanzies the cocky heroes that made America's space  program successful.  He punctures the myths that have grown up around such  legendary men as Chuck Yeager, John Glenn and Alan Shepard and portrays  them honestly, warts and all.  The test pilot sequences and the onerous  astronaut training are the best parts, but the whole book is utterly  fascinating.  &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; may very well be the best  aviation story ever written.	2000-07-22

Published in 1987, Kennedy was trying to sound the alarm that a great power such as the United States  puts its future economic livelyhood at stake when its defense costs become  too burdonsome.  In the case of the Soviet Union Kennedy was right on the  money, so to speak.  But the American economy has proven much more  resiliant than anyone might have expected during the 80s.  Kennedy's book  is best read today for its account of how innovation as the result of  constant warfare helped propel the West to supremacy in the world.  Overall, this is a vital political science book that was required reading  for a foreign policy class at my university ten years ago.  I should check  back to find out if it still is.	2000-07-21

That is the Simpson's  message and he dramtizes it with various accounts of mountaineering  tragedies and triumphs.  There are also light moments, such as the photo of  a Sherpa lifting up three granite blocks with his, ahem, scrotum.  Overall,  this is an excellent read for anyone interested in mountaineering.	2000-07-21

Too bad, since Raymond Bonner's  account of American involvement in the Phillippines is one of the best  examples of the genre.  Bonner follows Uncle Sam's footprints on the  archipelago from the granting of independence after World War II until the  inglorious fall of Ferdinand and his revolting wife Imelda.  Bonner raises  the legitimate question as to if such support was necessary for American  security.  Such questions may be moot now, but they still make for  fascinating reading.	2000-07-21

Fest's account is thoroughly researched and and meticulously detailed and was a best sellerin West Germany before  being published in the U.S.  Though not as readabled as Robert Payne's  superior &quot;The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler,&quot; it still paints a  fairly complete portrait of the man.  If the book has any drawback, it is  that it does not spend enough time on Hitler's pre-World War I activities.  Payne much more thoroughly documents the humiliation and disappointment in  Vienna that searled Hitler's soul and helped turn him into a monster.  Nevertheless, Fest's &quot;Hitler&quot; remains one of the defining  biographies of the 20th century's most evil figure.	2000-07-21

Together, they rose to the pinacle of success by  shielding their paranoid boss from all those with whom he did not wish to  associate.  And together they fell, both resigning on the last day of April  1973 as the heat from the Watergate scandal began to scorch the second term  President who had been reelected by a landslide only months before.  Rather  and Gates's account, while lacking historical perspective, is fascinating  in how it depicts two power hungry men who moved largely in the shadows.  They served their boss well, even to the end when it was hoped that by  their sacrifice he would be saved.  Political junkies will love their  story.	2000-07-21

His place as a general in blue ranks behind only Sherman and Grant.  His best moments were at Winchester where he stemmed a Union  defeat and turned it into a smashing vistory, and at Five Forks where he  routed a derelict George Pickett and ended the stalemate around Petersburg.  He also led a fascinating life in the military both before and after the  war, eventually becomming the army's commanding general late in his life.  Morris's book is well written, but it lacks the drama of say the recent  biographies of Grant and Sherman.  I think this is because the stories of  those two generals, who both overcame much adversity in both their personal  and professional lives, are much more compelling.  Sheridan was a great  general, but not a tragic or epic figure.  But at least he has a biography  that does his memory justice.	2000-07-21

I must give the nod to this book as the  better of the two.  It is more readable and gives a better overall account  of the tortured mind that led many millions to their deaths.  Payne's  account is particularly strong in following Hitler's Vienna period, when he  ended up as a homeless vagabond.  He eventually spent several years in a  men's shelter where he earned a living painting postcards and spent time  entertaining his companions with his occasional ranting outbursts.  Particularly surprising is that Hitler displayed no documented traces of  anti-semitism before World War I.  Don't expect detailed portraits of other  Nazis.  This is Hitler's story and his alone.  As Payne points out, without  him there would have been no other Nazis.	2000-07-21

Unfortunately, by the time the 1980s rolled around, Thompson had lost a few miles-an-hour off  his fastball and could no longer knock 'em dead like he used to.  Though  you can still delight at the occasional potshot at those in power (like his  description of George Bush senior as &quot;the mean, preppie vice  president&quot;), overall he fails to consistently produce the kind of  cutting satire that he could in his prime.  It was almost as if he had come  to personify the &quot;Uncle Duke&quot; character by which Gary Trudeau had  been lampooning him for all these years.  Sadly, we must use his own words  to report that the master has &quot;cashed his check.&quot;	2000-07-20

The most interesting  fact that I did not know was that Young's first professional band included  the one and only Rick James!  Young obviously offered author Downing no  assistance in putting this biography together, and it shows.

While the U.N. fed the people, Morris's company  fed the U.N.  As chronicled by fellow countryman and reporter Trisha  Stratford, somewhere along the way Morris decided to do what he could to  help the Somali people.  For his trouble and due in part to U.N. bungling,  he ended up dead.  In the context of the greater disaster that was the U.N.  mission to Somalia, Morris's death might seem only a small part.  But the  trouble he and his company had with the World body are lessons that need to  be learned if the U.N. is ever going to be an effective force for  international intervention.  This book is an excellent journalistic account  of bureaucratic failure.	2000-07-20

And anyone who wants to begin to understand modern China must start with this book.  Harrison Salisbury is an excellent  journalist and writer who chronicles the tragic history of China from the  beginning of the communist regime through the early 1990s.  He focusses on  the two leaders, Mao and Deng, who guided China into the modern era,  causing at least as much if not far more destruction to their country the  good that came from modernity.  The irony is that while Mao was an  egomaniacal madman, Deng was at heart a decent man who rebounded from being  jailed and humiliated by the Cultural Revolution only to ruin his more  benevolent legacy at Tianamen Square in 1989.  Salisbury's account is  readable and insightful and is essential for anyone with an interest in the  country.	2000-07-18

Bissenger's &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; as one of the best pieces of &quot;Americana&quot; writing in the 1990s.  Like Bissenger, Horwitz uses a  familiar subject, Civil War remeberance, as a canvas on which to paint his  verbal portraits of what's happening in (particularly rural) America.  He  does this with writing that is at times funny, moving and tragic.  Horwitz  deserves a purple heart for accompanying &quot;harcore&quot; reenactor  Robert Lee Hodge (pictured on the book's cover) on his crazy one week 1000  mile rememberance quest called, fittingly, &quot;The Civil Wargasm.&quot;  Anyone with an interest in the Civil War should read this masterful book  for thought provoking insight as to why the war continues to fascinate and  haunt many Americans.	2000-07-18

Stanley I. Cutler is one of the first to look at the scandal from a &quot;historical&quot; perspective.  He  does an excellent job of presenting the events in the proper historical  context, removed as they now are from the political passions that bolied  over at the time.  Nixon then was a discraced figure with a core of ardent  supporters.  He managed to partly rehabilitate himself before his death by  outlasting many of his enemies.  This book shows, in all grim detail, why  Nixon should never be allowed to complete his quest for rehabilitation.  It  shows clearly the dangers of electing a President willing and able to  deliberately misuse his power.	2000-07-18

But few were more mediocre or more completely dedicated to Hitler.  Ribbentrop's stunning ineptness was quite apparent long before he assumed  the foreign ministry portfolio.  He was so heavilly mocked by the British  when he served as Ambassador to London before the war (once even giving the  &quot;Hitler salute&quot; to the the King) that he developed a fierce  hatred for the country whose language he spoke fluently.  Bloch scarcely  conceals his utter contempt for the man who may be the most fascinating  Nazi other than Hitler.  That such a buffoon could rise to such heights and  literally stumble his way into becoming a major war criminal would be  humorous if it were not in fact so terrifying.	2000-07-18

My favorite is &quot;I Remember Me,&quot; a chilling tale that envisions the end of the world in the form  of a disease that slowly robs every human being of his or her memory.

Paul Wilson is a horror writer and &quot;The Tomb&quot; has some supernatural elements to it.  But the book reads more like detective fiction.  Repairman Jack is one of the more appealing and memorable  fictional characters I've come across and his &quot;profession&quot;  reminded me of John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee.  And like any good hero of  detective fiction, Jack's psyche is haunted by dark and troubling events  from his past that WIlson covers in detail.  This is an exciting book that  should be read for the quality of its storytelling alone.	2000-07-15

How the  modern evening news came to resemble tabloid shows like &quot;A Current  Affair&quot; and &quot;Hard Copy&quot; is plainly evident in Boyer's  descriptions of how CBS executives came increasingly to see television news  as &quot;entertainment.&quot;  As news consumers, we are all worse off for  this unfortunate development.	2000-07-15

It is ironic that Sherman is villified by many in the South today.  True, he waged war  on the civilian population, but he did so in order to minimize battle  deaths on both sides (his soldiers plundered the civilians, but they rarely  killed any of them).  And his belief in a &quot;soft peace&quot; and his  anti-reconstruction views caused many in Dixie to tout him as a  Presidential candidate after the war.  Marszalek brings these and many  other surprising facts to life.  He also manages to get inside the head of  the great but insecure soldier who first and formost sought order in his  life.  Overall, this is a first rate biography.	2000-07-15

It seems the better the drama, the better his prose.  He retells  the story of the battle for Texan independence from Mexico the treatment it  deserves, in the process seperating fact from myth.  The story of the Alamo  is of course exciting, but I found Sam Houston's victory over Santa Anna at  the battle of San Jacinto even more interesting.  This is a great history  book from one of the best history writers of the 20th century.	2000-07-15

Harry tries to track down the whereabouts of a teenage hooker who has gotten herself involved with a ring of snuff film makers.  The case takes  Stoner through the underworld of his native Cincinnati, and never have the  streets of the Queen city seemed so ominous.  The climax is befittingly  brutal and bloody.

Lord shows the battle from the perspective of each  of the participants and he emphasizes how the overwhelming American victory  was the result of gritty determination combined with sheer luck.  This is  an excellent tribute to the brave men who fought perhaps America's most  desperate major battle.	2000-07-15

Stoner occupies his home base of Cincinnati much like McGee  occupies Ft. Lauderdale.  A fine example of detective fiction, if you can  find it.	2000-07-15

In his earlier incarnation, McGee was less cynical but more of a hedonist.  He became a more appealing hero the more world weary he beacme.  Nevertheless,  &quot;Pale Gray for Guilt&quot; is the best of the earlier books because it  has a classic McGee story that could be the plot of an old west movie.  Bad  guys kill the hero's friend and the hero sets out for revenge.  Only with  McGee, you know the revenge won't be conventional in nature.	2000-07-15

Nevertheless, as with all Stoner books, you  get a first rate detective story in the bargain.	2000-07-15

What you're in for is a lot of unnecessary bloat, and  &quot;The Talismen&quot; is no exception.  King's stories are better the  closer to plausible reality he keeps them and this books best parts don't  take place in the mythical otherworld created by King and Straub.  Part of  the problem here might be that each author may have been too polite to ask  the other to trim his sections of the writing.  The fate of the book  resembles that of many rock'n'roll supergroups; a mediocre effort not  worthy of the reputation of the participants.	2000-07-15

Krakauer understands the mentality of a  foolish youth who would risk life and limb in the hopes of great adventure.  He understands, as he relates, because he once was that youth.  Krakauer  is a master storyteller whose prose evokes vivid images not only of the  last two years of Chris McCandless's life, but also of that strange breed  of person who is drawn to Alaska to get as far away as possible from the  constraints of life in the lower 48.  McCandless's story is fascinating and  Krakauer does a great service to his memory.	2000-07-12

The surprise is not that Reagan was not in control of underlings like Oliver North, but that he was so out of touch that incoming Chief of Staff Howard Baker  actually considered whether the constitutional provision for removing an  incapacitated President might have to be invoked!  Mayer and McManus write  with the sharp eye of crack investigative reporters.  While the results may  not be as compelling as &quot;All the President's Men,&quot; they still  present an unsettling account of what goes on in the corridors of power.	2000-07-12

He was a liberal on racial issues until he lost his first race for the Alabama governorship because of race baiting.  Carter relates these surprising facts and documents how Wallace's brand of  conservatism became adopted by mainstream candidates such as Ronald Reagan  and also how an assassain's bullet pushed him toward that path of asking  for redemption from the very people he had previously villified.

As a Jew, his heroism in  remaining in Beirut during the abduction period cannot be understated.   Also, given his ethnicity, his  appraisal of Israel and its conflict with  the Palestinians is frank and eye-opening.  Friedman is an excellent writer  and reporter and he presents his images and insights with sharp clarity.   Though the events he reports may be over a decade past, they are still  quite relevant today.	2000-07-12

But it  was Krakauer's  incredible storytelling that popularized the story in the first place.   Krakauer is a good climber, and an even better writer.  That he seemingly  possesses little of the cockiness often associated with mountaineers is a  big plus.  He was truly devastated by what happened on Everest that year  and writing this book was obviously theraputic for him.  As a reader, you  find yourself thankful that if the trajedy had to occur, that at least a  first rate journalist was there to witness it first hand.  This book is  destined to be a long-remembered classic.	2000-07-11

Because no one  on the expedition survived, there is not much in the way of a first hand  account of the trajedy.  The rescue effort that became a body search is  interesting and gives the reader a sense of how potential resucures are  also potential victims.  The highlights of the book are author Jenkins's  descriptions of what it is like to be caught by an avalanche.  This is  chilling stuff, indeed.  The book's main drawback is that the central story  can't fill its  relatively brief 220 pages, which forces Jenkins to relate  many other historical avalanche stories, some of which are more interesting  than the book's main subject.  Overall, it is not a bad read and will be of  particular interest to those wholike mountaineering stories.	2000-07-11

Two points beg to be made here.  First, climbing the seven summits  (the tallest mountains on each continent) is by the standards of true  mountaineers not a terribly impressive feat.  Second, Dick and Frank are  exactly the types of &quot;amatures&quot; who got caught on Everest and  died or were horribly maimed during the events chronicled by &quot;Into  Thin Air.&quot;  This book, unfortunately, may have served as the  inspiration for people who have no business attempting the world's highest  peaks.  Nevertheless, it is a fun read for those interested in  mountaineering.  But its no &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot;	2000-07-11

The book features essays about players, teams, stadiums,  season, statistics and Boswell's own unique perspective on the game.  For  example, Boswell is of the belief that Ted Williams did more damage to the  art of hitting than any other player because of his insistance that batters  should not swing at the first pitch.  Boswell provides ample statistical  proof to show that batters who do hit better!  This is a great book for  anyone interested in the national pastime.	2000-07-09

Pistone	Books	5	31	37	N	N	Better than the movie	&quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; the movie, while compelling, contains numerous glaring inacuracies that will jump out at you while reading the book.  Two of the most galling are that Pistone (Donnie) cared what happened to Lefty  (Al Pacino's character), when in fact Pistone never lost sight of the fact  that Lefty was a bad guy.  Also, the movie makes it seem as though  Pistone's superiors interfered with his operation and did not appreciate  him.  The book clearly dispells this distortion.  Pistone's account of life  in the mafia compares with Nicholas Pillegi's &quot;Wiseguy&quot; as  compelling reading.  And it will dispell any remaining notions that mob  life is glamorous.  Lefty's memorable movie scene in which he prepares to  meet his death is at least one moment in which the movie keeps to the  spirit of this great book.	2000-07-01

Amazingly, the reprehensible Gotti actually has his apologists.  The atrocious HBO biographical movie of  Gotti, for example, would have you believe the ridiculous notion that Gotti  didn't want the neighbor who was unwittingly responsible for the death of  Gotti's son harmed.  Instead, the movie portrays Sammy &quot;The Bull&quot;  Gravano as pulling off the murder in order to get on Gotti's good side!  Keep in mind that Sammy barely knew Gotti when this happened, and Gotti  wasn't the boss yet.  Blum's account shows all of Gotti's ugliness,  including the incredible arrogance that led to his downfall.  He also  chronicles the heroic efforts of the FBI team that would not rest until  Gotti was behind bars.  It is an exciting and well written account that  should appeal to anyone with an interest in criminology.	2000-07-01

If his storytelling were as crisp as his imagination is sweeping, he'd have a masterpiece on  his hands.  Alas, it can be very slow going at times as his narrator, the  captain of the fateful ship, describes in painstaking detail every single  thought that goes through his head!  Nevertheless, if you have the patience  you will find this a very rewarding and thought provoking book.  The ending  begs a sequel, though I don't think one has ever appeared.	2000-06-29

Spector lacks the storytelling touch of a Stephen Ambrose, but he still presents a full  account of what was actually the bloodiest year of the war.

General Harold Moore's account of the early days of American intervention in Vietnam, one cannot help but feel a bit of frustration.  Though the misguided &quot;search and destroy&quot; that  characterized America's initial efforts in Vietnam led to the near disaster  that was the battle of Ia Drang, it was Moore's remarkably effective  leadership that prevented the battle from being an American disaster.  The  irony is that the battle taught some very important lessons that the top  American leadership failed to learn until after the Tet offensive.  By  then, they had exhausted the goodwill that had previously existed on the  home front.  Moore's account of the battle is riveting and is one of the  most compelling accounts to come out of the war.  Anyone with an interest  in military history should read it.	2000-06-17

Garfield's account shows  how the American efforts there were hampered because military strategests  were slow to recognize the strategic importance of Alaska.  The Japanese  invasion was belatedly countered by an intense American effort to save  Alaska from becoming a Japanese base for operations against the mainland.  The ensuing struggle was fought in perhaps the worst weather conditions of  any campaign in the entire war.  Garfield is an excellent writer and this  book has the page turning quality of a suspense novel.  This is yet another  moving tribute to the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; in action.	2000-06-17

Needless to say, if you are a square or a raging conservative, you will HATE Thompson's warped vision of modern  America.  If however, you appreciate the Thompson style of &quot;Gonzo  Jornalism,&quot; then this classic of the style, while fictional, is a must  read.  The plot ceneters on Thompson's alter ego, Raul Duke, and his Samoan  &quot;attorney&quot; driving to Las Vegas to ingest as many drugs and party  as hard as they can.  What happens there is...well let's just say you've  got to read it for yourself.  Funny, outrageous and compellingly readable,  this is a book that simply cannot be ignored.	2000-06-17

Remarque's descriptions of the  terrible trench warfare of the Great War is so authentic it is hard to  believe that the events did not happen exactly as he desribed them.  One  can measure the accuracy of this book in the fact that when Adolf Hitler  came to power in Germany, this was one of the first books banned by the  Nazi regime.  No book that vividly portrays the horror of war had a place  in Hitler's militaristic Germany.  Never preachcy, the book instead uses  its simple desciptions to show how war truly is hell.	2000-06-17

Truman Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was the first (and best) of the genre.  Capote's  account tracks the mass killing of a Kansas family through the arrest and  trial of their killers to the execution of the two men responsible.  Along  the way, he provides an unforgettable account of a truly henious crime and  its aftermath.  The surprise twist towards the end would have seemed  contrived had it been part of a novel and shows the fallacy of assuming we  know what motivates a killer.  This book is a must read for anyone with  interest in criminology.	2000-06-17

My interpretation is that it is  suppose to be taken in the same vein as Stanley Kubrick's black comedy film  &quot;Dr. Strangeglove.&quot;  Not only was it written around the same time  at the height of the Cold War, it has the same high farce tone about it.  Vonnegut's ultimate fate for the world is sheer genius, though when it  finally happens, it seems almost like an afterthought.  Vonnegut's book is  a challenging read and one that is not for everybody.  Nevertheless, you'll  find yourself thinking about it long after you've put it down.	2000-06-17

Don't expect to get through it quickly, as the whole series  consists of nearly 2000 pages.  Those who like their SF writing fast and  action packed should look elsewhere.  Robinson's writing is literally  bursting with ideas and his descriptions of the political developments  among Martian colonists who as time goes by have less and less in commom  with the Earth the left behind rings absolutely true.  Warning, read  &quot;Red Mars&quot; only if you intend to complete the series for you'll  find yourself unable to avoid it.	2000-06-17

General Harold G. Moore's &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...and Young,&quot; as one of the best first person narratives to come  out of the Vietnam War.  Downs was a fresh faced platoon leader who, like  &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;'s Ron Kovic, looked forward to the  opportunity to prove his mettle under fire.  Like Kovic, Downs came back  from the war with a shattered body and a psyche that was deeply affected by  what he experienced.  Down's account of Vietnam is simple and  straightforward.  He is also an excellent writer and his book is a  compulsive page turner.  This is not a book that should be missed by those  with an interest in America's most tragic war.	2000-06-17

Pistone's &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; as one of the best insider accounts of life in the mafia ever published.  Unlike those other two books, however, &quot;Underboss&quot; presents the  life from the perspective of a mafia leader, in this case the notorious  Sammy &quot;the Bull&quot; Gravano, who was the number two to the  reprehensible John Gotti in the Gambino crime family.  Sure, Sammy's the  rat who brought Gotti down, but to hear him tell the tale, he only did so  because Gotti insulted Gravano's notions of &quot;honor among  thieves.&quot;  As a reader, one should keep in mind that this account is  solely Sammy's version of events.  Nevertheless, as told by the masterful  Peter Maas, his is one trully fascinating story indeed.	2000-06-17

His story  is an inspiring one for any American.  Author Peter Maas first reported on  Momsen's story nearly thrity-five years ago, and this project was a labor  of love for him.  His account of the sailors aboard the trapped submarine  is quite harrowing.  And the rescue is detailed with the right amount of  white knuckle suspense.  Overall, this well-written book is an excellent  and informative piece of reporting.	2000-06-17

Therefore, it is not surprising that his collection of short stories has the punch of classic short horror fiction.  These are dark  stroies dredged up from the depths of Vachss's fertile imagination.  Usually, they deal with the worst impulses of man, especially the sexual  predator.  They are not for the faint of heart, but are powerful in their  own way.	2000-06-17

Herr is an excellent reporter who risked life and limb to cover the Vietnam War.  The book is his account  of what he saw there.  What he saw was young American soldiers, far from  home fighting a war few of them understood against an frustratingly elusive  enemy.  If this sounds like the subject matter for many Vietnam books, it  is.  But Herr's writing is so evocative ans so powerful that many of his  descriptions will stay with you for a long time after you've put it down.  Along with Phillip Caputo's &quot;A Rumor of War,&quot; and Fredrick  Downs's &quot;The Killing Zone,&quot; this is one of the best personal  accounts of the Vietnam War available.	2000-06-17

Lincoln came to the presidency with one of the skimpiest political resumes of any  non-General in American History.  Donald shows how this Washington outsider  had to grope his way around at first, but then used his remarkable skills  to find the political center, which was vital though he often seemed to  stand alone.  Donald's book focusses on Lincoln's life through Lincoln's  eyes.  He does not go into great detail about Civil War battles or anything  else that Lincoln did not personally witness.  The result is a biography  that is as thorough as it is readable and that, like its subject, will  stand the test of time.	2000-06-17

His book &quot;Enemy at the Gates,&quot; is an appalling account of the battle of Stalingrad that captures the abject horror of that  campaign.  In &quot;The Fall of Japan,&quot; he gives us the end of World  War Two from the perspective of both the Japanese and American  belligerants.  The writing is crisp and he brings the story alive through  the eyes of those who lived it.  Particularly well described is effect of  the Atomic bombs and the decision by the Japanese emperor to overrule  custom and insist that the war be ended.  With this book, Craig deserves a  place alongside such excellent military historians as John Toland and  Stephen Ambrose.	2000-06-17

Hard to believe that the events of this book occurred thrity-odd years ago.  The tales of corruption in the  New York City police department could have come from the headlines of any  big city newspaper today.  Maas's genius is how he puts you with his  subject to the extent that you are not even aware that he's guiding you  through the story.  Anyone with an interest in law enforcement should read  this book and take it for what it is, a warning against the temptations of  the job.  As such, it is far from comforting.	2000-06-17

General Harold G. Moore's &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...and Young&quot; as one of the best  first person accounts to come from the Vietnam War.  Caputo was not  grievously wounded like Downs or Ron Kovic of &quot;Born on the Fourth of  July&quot; fame.  His scars were more of the psychological variety.  He  served his country faithfully and for his efforts he was nearly  court-martialed.  Caputo is an excellent writer (he became a journalist  after the war) and his descriptions are among the war's most vivid.  Not a  heroic tale, unless you consider that every man who went to Vietnam and did  his duty rather than following the example of our current  commander-in-chief is in his own way heroic.	2000-06-17

Had not General Lee's battle plans  fallen into the hands of the Union (which the dithering General McClelland  almost failed to take advantage of) President Lincoln would have been  unable to issue the emancipation proclamation and the European powers might  have officially recognized the Confederacy, therby permanently splitting  the United States.  Author Sears's account brings the battle to life in all  of its terrible glory.  Anyone with an interest in the Civil War should  read this book.	2000-06-17

The book is the real deal.  Amazingly, though written over forty years ago it has aged very well.  The most effective scenes are in  the military training, which ring quite authentic to anyone who has served.  The battle scenes evoke a vivid imagination that the movie version simply  could not capture.  What this novel really portrays is the society that  Heinlein obviously wished he lived in.  It is a much more honorable,  ordered and duty-bound society than our own.  Some might call his vision  fascist, but ask yourself, is it really any worse than Bill Clinton's  America?	2000-06-14

As good as &quot;Deliverance&quot; the movie is, the book is even better.  It goes into more detail about the motivations that led each character to the fateful canoe excursion.  Unfortunately, I read it after having seen  the movie numerous times, so I kept picturing Bert Reynolds, John Voight,  Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox in my mind.  Author Dickey is a great storyteller  at the top of his game.  That the novel also conatins a greater social  significance is also a given.  Mostly though, it is a fine exploration of  the modern American male and how dealing with his testosterone urges can  get him into trouble.	2000-06-14

McCammon's &quot;Swan Song&quot; as one of the best pieces of end-of-the-world fiction released in the last quarter century.  Authors  Niven and Pournelle develop some interesting and sympathetic characters and  them pit them against an earth shattering disaster.  The scenes of the  comet striking the earth are worth the price alone.

What affected me most was  the latter part which shows the years passing in the life of the main  survisor.  I rarely get emotional while reading, but this story did it to  me.	2000-06-14

The perp in question is  also one of the more interesting and psychologically tormented of the  entire series.

It reads like a Stephen King horror novel and treads some of the same ground.  The horror is a malevolent  computer that takes over a newly constructed building and proceeds to kill  the humans trapped inside in an increasingly grisly manner.  Author Kerr  makes all this quite exciting as long as you don't take it too seriously.	2000-06-13

Author Perret is genearlly sympathetic to his subject (even Grant's presidency,  which he concludes was no worse than numerous others from the nineteenth  century).  In a few spots, I found Perret's generalizations to be a bit too  general.  Nevertheless, the writing is lively and highly readable.  For  that I would recommend this book to anyone with a general interest in  American History, especially the Civil War period.  Grant remains a  somewhat misunderstood figure.  This book at least helps to provide his  memory with some clarity.	2000-06-13

Similar to Junger's  description of drowning, Philbrick provides a graphic description of death  by dehydration to emphasize what the fishermen were experiencing as they  drifted for three months in open whaleboats on the vast Pacific Ocean.  The  main difference between Philbrick's account and Jungers is that some of  Philbrick's fisherman lived to tell the tale.  Philbrick is an excellent  storyteller who brings his subject alive.  Anyone with an interest in  either the sea or a good adventure story will love this book.	2000-06-13

Inserting Theodore  Roosevelt into the proceedings (in small doses) was a masterstroke.  And  the mystery itself is as compelling as the backdrop.

Ambrose repays the debt in spades with this well written authoritative account of  Eisenhower's life.  This is history writing at its most readable.  Ambrose  portrays Ike as a genuine American hero, but does not ignore the negative,  such as his suspected affair during World War.  Most importantly, this is a  book for readers who do not want to get bogged down in the minutia  surrounding every event in Eisenhower's life.  What you get is a good  overview, detailed enough to give a good portrait of the man behind the  legend.	2000-05-22

As Yergin stresses, little that has been achieved in  the 20th century could have been achieved without it.  Starting with the  initial discoveries during the mid-nineteenth century and culminating with  the Gulf War, this is a sweeping story in the mode of David McCullogh's  &quot;The Path Between the Seas.&quot;  Yergin is a insightful and talented  writer and the book reads like an adventure story.

The stories of these  expeditions are expertly told by Fleming, who adds to his narrative  insightful commentary and a sense of humor.

Along the way he draws comparisons between them that are quite striking.  Both held considerable power in their societies at a relatively young age, were disgraced and yet were able to overcome.  Both also met a tragic end, though Crazy Horse's was far more so than Custer; who at least died doing what he enjoyed.  Also appreciated is Ambrose's take on the forcible relocating of the Plains tribes to reservations that is an honest assessment free from any &quot;liberal guilt.&quot; This is an important work from one of America's best history authors.	2000-05-22

Many of these were made into inferior  movies, but the stories themselves are are among the scariest things he's  written because they reduce fear to its most basic elements.

On &quot;Skeleton Crew,&quot;  (his second short story collection after the superb &quot;Night  Shift&quot;) he starts out with a novella, &quot;The Mist,&quot; which is  one of his best ever ideas.  The rest of the  stories are almost uniforly  excellent, but the best are probably &quot;The Raft,&quot;  &quot;Beachworld&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Todd's Shortcut.&quot;  This is a  book that allows King to be mentioned with the likes of Edgar Allan Poe and  one of the best horror writers ever.	2000-05-21

The first  of the four stories, &quot;The Langoliers,&quot; is one of his most  imaginative and all time best.  The other three stories are also quite  good.

A passibly scary story idea worthy of perhaps a novella length treatment in a &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot; type  collection, instead stretched out for seven or eight hundred pages until as  a reader insomnia is one of the last of your problems.  Once again, King  creates a decent setup that loses effectiveness as many pages crawl by with  little or no action.  This is not one of his best or in the end even all  that scary.	2000-05-21

From many unfortunately far more superior Stephen King stories, I'm afraid.  The biggest problem with &quot;Desperation&quot; is that the evil  protagonist is not one of King's more memorable.  Is it possible he has  tapped out his fertile imagination?  This book has the  &quot;Desperation&quot; of a once hot shot pitcher who has lost a few  miles-an-hour off of his fastball and is just trying to hang on.	2000-05-21

His pure horror works have become  increasingly erratic over the years, though this was actually one of his  scarier concepts.  Unfortunately, it takes so long to get to the payoff  that by the time it comes you scarcely care.  King's biggest fear these  days seems to be the &quot;Horror of the Black Marker.&quot;	2000-05-21

That is not the case with his sweeping, epic end-of-the-world novel &quot;The Stand.&quot;  For once, the subject  matter is worthy of the extended length and the uncut version just adds to  the book's pleasures.  The best part is still the first two hundred and  fifty pages or so, which feature King's descriptions of the world being  destroyed by the powerful flu.  The survivors' journey and battle in the  decimated wasteland of America is also very strong.  While some may knock  the underlying spiritualism, nobody can deny that this is a fantastic  adventure story, expertly told.	2000-05-21

That  should serve as notice just how good this collection is.  These are not  horror stories, but instead highly effective charachter studies and well  told in their own right.  &quot;Different Seasons&quot; shows what kind of  writer King might have been had not horror been his first love.

Stories like &quot;The Night Flier,&quot;  &quot;Chattery Teeth,&quot; &quot;Dolan's Cadilac,&quot; &quot;The Ten  O'Clock People,&quot; and &quot;Rainy Season&quot; are among the best and  scariest that he's written.

The plot turns on extended action by one character (the father of the dead child) that  just does not seem convincing.  After seeing what the semetary does to the  unfortunate creatures buried there, I found it unlikely that even in his  profound grief the father would try to resurrect his son.

Unfortunately, the monster does not do much of anything for a  couple of hundred pages after that except keep Tad and his mother trapped  for no real good reason.  Too bad, because &quot;Cujo&quot; starts off very  well, slowly weaving its fabric of terror.  After the disease apocalypse  and town destroying vampire hordes of some of King's previous works, this  one just doesn't measure up.	2000-05-20

This is not a pure horror story, it reads more like the anti-&quot;Its a Wonderful  Life.&quot;  Smith has a near fatal accident, spends years in a coma an  awakes with the ability to see the future (or at least, the bad things).  He becomes convinced that a rising politician will one day set off global  armageddon and tracks him across a mid-1970s landscape which even brings  him into contact with a startled dark horse Presidential candidate named  Jimmy Carter.  Even though it may lack the gutteral horrors of some of his  other novels, this is still one of King's best.	2000-05-20

No pretentious airs of aristocracy with King's vampires.  They are  mean, bad and on the march in the unfortunate town of Jerusalem's Lot.  Their leader, &quot;The Master,&quot; doesn't go in for Armani suits.  He's  bald, ugly and will suck you dry in a nanosecond, in the process turning  you against you former friends and neighbors.  Overall, this is one of  King's absolute best and certainly scariest novels.	2000-05-20

In addition to being WAY too long, &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; suffers from a second half that stretches believability  to the breaking point.  The setup is effective, of course at this point the  reader has no idea what is causing the increasingly horrific events in the  town.  The answer, as it unfolds, is a bit of a disappointment.  Also, few  of the many characters engender any sympathy.  This is not one of King's  better novels.	2000-05-20

In pursuit of that  truth, he travels around the world looking for examples that prove his  point.  All of that, however, is secondary to the fact that he's a damn  funny writer who enjoys tweaking liberals, which he does with the very  title of this book.

Musicant's account is a straightforward narrative history, but his talent as a writer keeps it from being draggy or  boring.  Particularly good are his accounts of the battles which have  narrative excitement and give a good overall view of tactics and strategy.  Musicant covers all aspects of the war, both geographically and  politically.

But his adventure in suburban Connecticut just isn't terribly  compelling and leads to perhaps the least satisfying climax of the whole  series.  Who would have thought that Burke's legendary &quot;Zero&quot; is  situated among the strip malls and housing developments!  Burke beginners  should start elsewhere (I recommend &quot;Flood&quot; or &quot;Blue  Belle&quot;).  This one's for hard core fans only.	2000-05-16

But never fear, beyond the opening Vachss  sends Burke in pursuit of the subject closest to his heart, a child being  sexually abused.  You know that Burke is going to find and confront those  responsible.  How he gets there, with the help of the &quot;witch&quot;  Strega, is well worth the price of admission.

Vachss's early Burke novels (&quot;Flood,&quot; &quot;Blue  Belle,&quot; &quot;Blossom&quot; and &quot;Hard Candy&quot;) remain the  best of the series.

The &quot;Belle&quot; of the title is one of Burke's more interesting leading ladies.  And the threat, in the form of the Ghost Van,  is one of the more horrific.  The climax is also one of the more memorable  in the Burke series.  Vachss is one of the best crime writers working  today.  Perhaps it is because his working with abused children brings him  so close to the dark side that he is able to capture it so well on the  written page.  &quot;Blue Belle&quot; is one his darkest and one of his  best.	2000-05-16

Wesley is a killing machine, and no one  can stop him, not even the mob.  When the mob takes Wesley on, he plays cat  and mouse with them...and litters the streets with bodies.  The book also  features Candy, a woman from Burke's childhood and through her Vachss  provides more insight into his title charachter's psyche.  Because it relys  so heavily on the reader's knowledge of the background of the charachters,  this is not the Burke novel to start with.

Kempe wrestles with the demons conjured by the spectre of one of his own  relatives having been a brutal Nazi thug and along the way shows how the  country is still struggling to deal with its past.  The accounts of German  soldiers having been used outside the country's borders for the first time  as peacekeeprs in Bosnia was a good first step toward the  &quot;normalizing&quot; of the German nation.

This book is most valuable as  a snaphot of Egypt that can be compared to life in the country thirty years  ago before Islamic militancy began to take hold.

However, the authors in addition to  portraying the human cost for not having done so, present the argument for  why it couldn't be done in deference to our Arab &quot;allies.&quot;  The  rest of the book chronicles life in 1990s Iraq under an isolated dictator  who was responsible for the physical destruction of his country.  The  battle over U.N. inspections also features prominently.  This all makes for  very compelling reading and the authors have told their story well.	2000-05-15

Sheehan (along with David Halberstam and others) and his experiences in Vietnam during the advisor period  (1962-64) are the subjects of this book.  With it you gain perspective of  how Sheehan and the others fought an incompotent and deceiptful American  and South Vietnamese government establishment that fought efforts to get  the truth (that the war was being lost) to the American people.  The  relationship between the young reporters and Lt. Colonel John Paul Vann  (the subject odf Sheehan's book) also features prominently.  The accounts  are harrowing and sometimes enraging.

Journalist Neil Sheehan first made a name for himself as a reporter in part thanks to the enigmatic American Hero, John Paul Vann.  Vann's story is  both fascinating and tragic.  His military career was seemingly derailed by  his attempts to tell the truth about the war during the advisor period  (1962-64), but in fact it was his personal indiscretions that did him in.  The book was the work of a lifetime for Sheehan (taking him many years to  complete) and it shows.  The only problem is that Vann's later career in  Vietnam as a civilian advisor (1967-1972) gets the short shrift.  Sheehan  uses Vann's combat death in 1972 as a metaphor for American involvement in  Vietnam.  But in fact, by 1972 Vann truly believed that the South  Vietnamese were winning the war and had they not been abandoned by their  American allies, they might have.  Nevertheless, this is a vital book for  anyone who wants to understand America's lost war.	2000-05-13

From Remnick's descriptions, you will know what it was like to  be a Russian in the heady days that included Glastnost, the conservative  backlash, the fateful coup and the final demise of Mikhail Gorbachev.  Remnick brings the story to life in a way that does it justice.  This is  absolutely essential reading.	2000-05-12

After all, he deserved to be arrested and imprisoned for his actions as a drug smuggler.  What he did not deserve  was to spend time in the hell on earth that is the Thai prison system.  The  first hand accounts of the conditions are startlingly brutal and ring  absolutely true.  Forget about the exploitative Hollywood film made about  this subject last year.  This is the real deal in the same vein as  &quot;Midnight Express.&quot;	2000-05-12

Throughout the long history of tranportation across the Central American isthmus (first railroad, then  canal) McCollough focusses on fascinating characters like the brilliant but  enigmatic Frechman Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built the Suez Canal but whose  career crashed and burned in Panama.  McCullough's skill as a storyteller  simply cannot be understated.  The book will leave you with a true  appreciation of just how Herculean an undertaking the canal was.  This book  is simply one of the best works of history to appear in the last quarter  century.	2000-05-12

Particularly fascinating is Boris Yeltsin, who is as central to this story  as he was to life in Russia in the century's last decade.  Yeltsin's tragic  encounter in Chechnya is particularly poignant.  This is a book that will  fill you with concern, but also hope for Russia's future.  Perhaps no  Westerner knows Russia better than Remnick.  His works are absolute must  reading on the subject.	2000-05-12

Specifically life in a football-crazed small town in Texas.  But before any of us outsiders start feeling superior, we should  reflect that the book is really about America and the way we overvalue  athletic ability.  The people of the town felt betrayed when they realized  that author H.G.Bissinger was going to tell the whole story, warts and all.  But he has written a masterful social history and one that has many  implications beyond the gridiron.	2000-05-12

The  story may not be as epic as his accounts of the  building of the Panama  Canal or the Brooklyn Bridge, but it is nevertheless a fascinating account  of what can happen when man becomes arrogant enough to believe that he can  master nature.  Like the story of the Titanic and the Galveston Hurricane  is shows how easilly nature can have the last word.	2000-05-12

While I disagree with the degree to which O'Rourke would  cut government programs, I do agree with his fundamental notion that much  of what the government does should be reexamined to determine if the  government should in fact be doing it.  This book is a rarity--it will make  you laugh and think at the same time.	2000-05-12

Royko knew Chicago.  The city was in his blood.  As such,  he knew Mayor Daley the elder better than anyone who was not a family  member or a member of his administration.  Royko shows how the  since-deceased Democratic machine ran Chicago, both for the good and the  bad.  Read it, and you will understand the likes of Congressman Dan  Rostenkowski, who ended up in jail because he continued to practice machine  politics long after the machine had died.  Hats off to Mike Royko.  This  book is his masterpiece.	2000-05-12

Having said that, he has written the best sports book of the late 1990s.  &quot;A Civil War,&quot; is about much  more than just the Army-Navy game.  It is about life in the service  academies and how a special group of recruits truly do play just for the  love of the game.  Feinstein lucked out a chose a (very) rare season in  which both Army and Navy made it to bowl games.  The Army-Navy game itself  that year was also a heartbreaker.  There are so many good individual  stories among the players that you will swear he made some of them up.  This is sportswriting at its absolute best.	2000-05-12

After reading &quot;The Firm&quot; and &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; I have come to the conclusion the Grisham is one of the worst writers ever to top  the bestseller list.  &quot;The Firm&quot; starts out plausibly, but then  goes totally haywire at about the two-thirds mark with an ending as  believable as your average romance novel.  If Grisham was as good an  attorney as he is a writer, there'd be a lot more people on death row.	2000-05-12

Shaara is so effective at recreating the battle of Gettysburg that you often forget that its a novel.  The authenticity is absolutely  amazing.  The book was used as the basis for TNT's superior film  &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; and it is easy to see why.  Shaara's descriptions  are so vivid, they're like screenwriting just waiting to be filmed.  Just  like the movie, Union Colonel Joshua Chamberlain is the most memorable  character.  His story, like this book is for anyone who wants to know what  it truly means to be an American.	2000-05-12

Hunter Thompson HATED Richard Nixon with all of his capacity to loathe.  Nixon represented to him everything that was wrong with America.  So for Thompson to have been covering Tricky Dick during the fateful events that  ensured his downfall is a delicous irony indeed.  This book is akin to  Thompson's &quot;Hell's Angels&quot; in that he is reporting about real  events, albiet through his own warped perception.  The book is a reminder  that once upon a time, Thompson was a very capable reporter, before he  turned his mind into mush and became a caricature of himself.  Politics  junkies will find this book to be great comic relief.	2000-05-11

The great Mississippi Flood of 1927, one of THE greatest disasters in American history, is now largely forgotten despite the social upheavals it caused.  What is eerie about &quot;Rising Tide&quot; is the parallels  between the events of 1927 and the floods of 1993 and how the lessons of  the past follies in flood control have been largely forgotten.  Of course  the 1993 floods caused no major social upheavals and that is at least as  important to the story.  At least we've evolved as a society to the point  where a small clique of power brokers could never be allowed to  deliberately flood a poor parrish to save their own homes.  At least, I  hope.  This is a highly readable and very informative book for history  buffs.	2000-05-11

This was the first step in to turning these reporters into  &quot;stars&quot; in their own right.  Who can doubt today that the  visibility one gets from being a reporter on a successful Presidential  campaign can transform you into a highly paid and visible &quot;talking  head.&quot;  Crouse's book is well written, informative and quite amusing,  which is appropriate since he spent the campaign hanging out with the  immortal Hunter S. Thompson.  A must for political junkies.	2000-05-11

The Angels were a fairly new phenomenon in the public mind when Thompson went  riding with them and recorded all that he saw.  It is a fascinating account  of what has become one of America's most notorious criminal enterprizes.  Thompson's description of an LSD rush (taken when the drug was still legal)  is worth the price alone.  For all his troubles, the Angels beat him half  to death.  This is a must read for anyone ineterested in criminology.	2000-05-11

To add  even more heartbreak to this story is the accounts of how after the mass  killings the U.N. came in and provided aid--to the killers!

Never again could a major candidate engage in a primary campaign with only a single reporter following him around.  White's success ensured  that every event and public conversation in a campaign, however minor,  would be duly reported.  Like many groundbreaking classics, it may seem  trite today to readers accostomed to knowing every little detail of a  candidate's life.  But White invented this type of journalism, and if read  with that in mind this is still a spellbinding book.  It reads like a  suspense novel, and is a compulsive page turner right to the end.	2000-05-11

Cohen's informative and excellently written narrative is the best place to start.  Cohen does more than just describe the events, he  attempts to get beneath the surface to understand the psychology behind the  unspeakable atrocities committed during the various wars.  The trajedy of  Yugoslavia cannot be understood without a recounting of the atrocities  committed there during World War II, atrocities that largely went  unpunished.  All of this and more are recounted by Cohen in his very  readable account.  It is must reading for anyone interested in recent  European history.	2000-05-11

Here, White is not nearly as hard on Richard Nixon for  Watergate as subsequent events have proven he should have been.  Nevertheless, this is still an informative account of the 1972 election,  which was much more exciting than the final result would indicate.

Warren led the Supreme Court from 1953-1969, perhaps the most turbulent period in American history outside the Civil War.  His rulings have shaped modern jurisprudence and, despite  their controversial nature when they were issued, have repeatedly shown  their wisdom since.  The author also spends a lot of time on Warren's early  political career as a District Attorney, Governor of California and failed  Vice Presidential candidate in 1948.  Overall, this is a fascinating and  well-written biography.	2000-05-10

Author Bain just doesn't have the touch of a David McCollough (&quot;The Path Between the Seas&quot;) to make his lengthy narrative consistantly interesting.

This book is best for those who want an overall narrative about the war that includes every aspect (the section on the Gallipoli campaign is  particulary enlightening).

With Sierra Leonne in the news recently, this book takes on even more urgency.  Peterson deserves  credit for sticking it out in the destitute war zones, even after nearly  losing his life in Somalia (and seeing close friends butchered by the mobs)  He is (justifiably) highly critical of the U.S. and UN efforts there, but  he also assigns the blame for the famine where it belongs, with the  warlords.  This is an excellent and informative book that will  unfortunately never find as big an audience as it deserves.	2000-05-10

The title refers to 1948 being the last presidential campaign waged before televison began to have a  &quot;shrinking effect&quot; on campaigns.  The book explodes some of the  myths about the election and shows how Truman used &quot;lowball&quot;  tactics against Dewey, who refused to respond.  This was also the first  campaign to be affected by the emerging Cold War, which helped torpedo the  hopes of the Progressive candidate, Henry Wallace.  It also saw the  beginnings of the civil rights backlash in the South personified by  candidate Strom Thurmond.  Overall, this is a well-written history book  that is very readable.	2000-05-09

That America could have an election at all in the midst of a Civl War was astonishing.  Equally amazing is that the re-election of Lincoln, which  seems like it would have been a no-brainer, was actually very much in doubt  until a series of military vicories, including the fall of Atlanta, late in  the campaign.

Even if you do not reside in Chicago, your heart cannot help but be moved by the columns in which he tried to help the little people  against whatever force (bureaucratic, criminal or otherwise) that was  trying to trample them.

Chang details the grusome carnage that followed Japan's takeover of the city that was  then China's capitol.  The Japanese were so brutal in fact, that the top  local Nazi official on the scene was horrified.

Most surprising are the details about his involvement  with the Nation of Islam and how that involvement both ruined his first  marriage and caused him to turn his back on his great friend, Malcolm X.  This book is for sports fans and anyone else interested in reading about an  extrodinary life.	2000-05-09

That any of the expedition, let alone their leader, survived is nothing short of miraculous.  Guttridge's compelling, page turing narrative  presents a fascinating story that has been often overlooked.  Most  interesting is Greely himself, whose long and dedicated government career  was blemished only, if at all, by the disaster that befell his expedition.  Despite his trials and tribulations, Greely was in the end a true American  hero.	2000-05-04
2496352:US	51809405	R1FN3O2MW6WP0V	0684854848	919570880	Blind Eye: How the Medical Establishment Let a Doctor Get Away with Murder	Books	5	1	1	N	N	So good, its scary	&quot;Blind Eye&quot; haunted me for quite awhile after I read it.  The book portrays a classic example of evil being assisted by bureaucratic ineptitude.  Stewart makes his case that Dr. Michael Swango may be the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.  His case is a compelling page  turner that reads like fiction.  Even scarier is that Swango is due to be  released THIS YEAR.  One caution, do not read this book if you are planning  to be in the hospital any time soon.  You will not find it comforting.	2000-05-04

(Personally, I recommend &quot;The Ghosts of Cape Sabine&quot; by Leonard  Guttridge).  &quot;Ice Blink&quot; isn't bad, but it could have used some  more meat on its bones.  There is a lot of speculation by the author, which  figures given that there are no survivor accounts of the Franklin  expedition.  The book is well written, and particularly facinating is  Cookman's descriptions of how botulism poison came to contaminate the  expedition's canned food.  Overall, I wish Cookman had gone into a bit more  detail, but I still found the story fascinating.	2000-05-01
2503437:US	51809405	R16VKNCM7MG61J	0375406395	574735145	The Last Great Revolution: Turmoil and Transformation in Iran	Books	4	12	17	N	N	An informative account of modern life in an Islamic state	Wright's book is valuable for its first hand reporting of the current situation in Iran, both politically and culturally, as the country struggles to overcome the setbacks of the revolution.  Iran seems to figure  very little in the conciousness of the average American.  But as Wright  makes clear, America still holds both fascination and revulsion to the  average Iranian.  Wright's interviews with numerous Iranians and her  extensive travels around the country provide a vivid narrative that will  surprise the average reader.  Overall, a very good read that provides lots  of insight into where Iran is and where it might be headed.	2000-05-01
2509111:US	51809405	R1ZBDDEGSQYCWE	0060977477	637283524	The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Exciting Drama in the &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; Mode	I read this book almost immediately after &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and was immediately taken by the similarities.  Again, I found myself asking why anyone would risk such a potentially hideous death.  Of course, there  is a huge difference between rough hewn fisherman trying to eek out a  living and the bored noveau rich out looking for a thrill.  Junger builds  the suspense very well and his first hand description of drowning is  absolutely riveting.  As with Krakauer's book, this is great non-fiction  that reads like an adventure story.	2000-04-27
2509294:US	51809405	R39R46VUK85QNW	0688144772	607150831	Fire on the Mountain: The True Story of the South Canyon Fire	Books	5	16	17	N	N	A harrowing true story of some genuine heros	Like &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; and &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, Maclean's book is a modern tale of young physically fit people whose lives are snuffed out by the forces of nature.  This time, however, the victims  engaged in the risk in order to help others, which makes their deaths all  the more tragic.  Maclean's account reads like a novel and it is obvious  that he knows this material well.  His moment by moment description of the  firefighters' attempted escape as the flames bore down on them is  breathtaking.  Overall, an excellent and heartbreaking true adventure  story.	2000-04-27
2509335:US	51809405	R2D9IIUN1B3PFY	0684826976	646280776	Undaunted Courage:  Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West	Books	5	0	1	N	N	One of the best American History books ever written	Not to be hyperbolic, but Stephen Ambrose has written a history book that should be required reading in every American high school.  He brings the Lewis and Clark story to life with such vibrancy that the book reads like  adventure fiction.  Surprises abound for those only marginally familiar  with the Lewis and Clark story.  One simply cannot underestimate their  contribution to their country.  Most fascinating is Ambrose's critique of  them as military commanders, which they were.  Simply put, an outstanding  and monumental historical work.	2000-04-27
2509728:US	51809405	RF0HMYXXUTZXL	0670885517	700763528	The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory	Books	5	3	7	N	N	A first rate historical account	Nobody knows &quot;Old Hickory&quot; like Robert Remini and with this short but very enjoyable book, he recreates the high point of Jackson's military career.  Little remembered by history is just how important this  battle was, not only because it restored American pride after a war gone  badly, but because it prevented the British from establishing hegemony over  the Mississippi River and with it America's heartland.  The battle scenes  are well described and the heroism of the American leader is well  chronicled.  This is a great history book just begging to be made into a TV  miniseries.	2000-04-27
2509921:US	51809405	R17CJJ73C5UX2F	0375409335	27895627	Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History	Books	5	4	4	N	N	History as Adventure Story	Larson's book is a masterpiece of historical storytelling.  Rather than a dry retelling of the events surrounding the 1900 Galveston hurricane, Larson personalizes them by focussing on Isaac Cline, the meteorologist who  in the tenor of the times was arrogant enough to think that man had  mastered the weather.  Larson's account of the destruction of Galveston is  particularly riveting.  Also interesting is his his history of weather  forcasting before 1900.  A classic piece of history writing that contains  both a moral and and a warning.	2000-04-27
2510234:US	51809405	R1HYHOS4FXYWK6	0465017363	801178064	Duel: Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, And The Future Of America	Books	5	9	12	N	N	History Truly Comes Alive	Thomas Fleming has written a great piece of history than reads almost like a novel.  Burr and Hamilton come alive with all of their virtues and their many faults.  One of my favorite ancedotes is Fleming's account of how  during the revolution, when Martha Washington named the tomcat she kept  &quot;Hamilton,&quot; after her husband's military aide, because of the  cat's amorous ways.  The biggest surprise in the book is the recounting of  the large contributions Burr made to an idependent judicary by thwarting  Jefferson's attempt to have Justice Samuel Chase impeached.  This occurred  AFTER Burr killed Hamilton.  &quot;Duel&quot; stands with Ambrose's  &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; as one of the best American History books of  the last five years.	2000-04-27

It sounds the alarm of environment degredation.  Lie Herstgaard, Woodard does not just sit around  and speculate, he travelled to the world's environmental trouble spots and  reports what he saw.  Particularly chilling is his description of the  &quot;death&quot; of the Black Sea and how a similar fate might befall the  Gulf of Mexico.  Like Herstgaard, Woodard offers solutions for the  environmental crises he describes, however unlikely that they might ever be  enacted by world governments.  For the most part, this is quite a  compelling book.	2000-04-27
2510458:US	51809405	RVPCV2OHAAELS	0684844184	69350065	When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi	Books	5	0	0	N	N	An Outstanding Biography	This is a book for more than just sports fans.  Actually, it might be even more valuable for those who want to know how to lead people.  Lombardi was a master at getting what he wanted from others, especially on the football  field.  Surprises abound, however.  Lombardi was a lifelong Democrat, very  progressive on racial issues and a learned man who studied four different  foreign languages.  Even his famous &quot;Winning isn't everthing...&quot;  quote was in fact quoted incorrectly and its meaning was misconstrued.  Maraniss's book does great justice to a towering and misunderstood cultural  icon.	2000-04-27

This one was man made rather  than natural, however.  Dillion's account of the hazards of fishing off  Alaska's wild coastline is the highlight of this book.  People who love the  sea or enjoy a good adventure should give this story a read.	2000-04-27

Had Lukas just stuck to the story at hand and recounted it in three hundred or so pages, he would have had a classic on his hands.  Instead, he attempts to include every little detail  and historic figure in the America of the last century's first decade.  The  story itself is quite powerful; a former governor assasinated by labor  activists and the subsequent attempt to railroad union leaders.  Too bad it  drowns in a turbulent ocean of unnecessary detail.	2000-04-27

His method is simple  but effective.  He travelled  around the world and witnessed environmental disasters first hand.  Particularly chilling is the chapter on China.  He is also realistic,  acknowledging that the biggest environmental crisis consists of  billions  of third world citizens who aspire to a first world lifestyle and the  environmental damage this would cause.  Hertsgaard also offers solutions,  however unlikely that they might be implemented any time soon.  A very  worthwhile book.	2000-04-27
