Kirkpatrick, former Ambassador to the United Nations under Ronald Reagan, is the author of one of the three most famous essays in the history of American foreign policy, \\"Dictatorships and Double Standards,\\" Commentary (November 1979)--the other two being George F. Kennan's call for \\"containment\\" of the Soviet Union and The End of History by Francis Fukuyama.  In it she argued that it was incumbent on the United States to differentiate between authoritarian regimes and totalitarian regimes.  Authoritarian regimes she argued, like Iran and Nicaragua, though they obviously did not meet our preferred standards of democratization, were fundamentally just harsh, but traditional, governments of countries which had known no other type of government and were perhaps not yet ready for democracy :<br /><br />  \\"Traditional autocrats leave in place existing allocations of wealth, power, status, and other<br /><br />  resources, which in most traditional societies favor an affluent few and maintain masses in poverty.<br /><br />  But they worship traditional gods and observe traditional taboos.  They do not disturb the habitual<br /><br />  rhythms of work and leisure, habitual places of residence, habitual patterns of family and personal<br /><br />  relations.\\"<br /><br />Essentially, the autocracies protect their own power and wealth, but leave most other aspects of life relatively untouched.  As the name implies, they are more concerned with who in society will wield authority, i.e. themselves, than with imposing any particular ideology.  Because this is the case, they in fact preserve many of the institutions upon which democracy can later be built, whether the Church or corporations or other civic organizations.<br /><br />Totalitarian regimes, on the other hand, as the name implies, seek to totally reinvent and control every aspect of society.  This requires them to so violate the existing institutions as to render the society nearly incapable of evolving into a democracy.<br /><br />These fundamental differences between the two types of regimes suggest important reasons that we should be more rigorous in our approach to the one than the other.  Because authoritarian regimes are less oppressive of their citizens and are more amenable to democracy they are more susceptible to pressure from without, but at the same time, particularly when Kirkpatrick was writing, at the very nadir of the Cold War, it was especially dangerous to destabilize these generally friendly regimes, particularly in light of the fact that they could be expected, over a period of years, to gradually transform themselves into more democratic societies.<br /><br />Meanwhile, authoritarian regimes, like Cuba and Vietnam, though they tend to cast their ideology in the language of progressive democracy, which makes them seem somehow more akin to the U.S., in reality are much more oppressive of their people and, because they destroy traditional institutions, tend to create such devastation that it is extremely difficult for external pressure to aid the rise of democracy.  They are both worse for their people in the short run and more likely to endure in the long run.<br /><br />This leaves America in a difficult position.  Neither type of government vindicates our ideals of liberal democracy.  We would of course like to see both become more democratic.  But the regimes we can most easily change are the less offensive ones, and ones that are likely to be our de facto allies.  Those regimes which truly brutalize their populations, and which at that time were generally allied with our enemy, the Soviet Union, tend not to be easily pressured.<br /><br />Further complicating matters is the fact that in countries with authoritarian regimes, there tend to be reasonably well-organized and very well supplied guerrilla movements.  This was particularly true when the Soviet Union and the rest of the Warsaw Pact nations existed and stood ready to support them.  Totalitarian nations, with their much more restrictive internal controls, and with the U.S. showing no interest in supplying indigenous rebellions, tended to be relatively free of organized civil unrest.<br /><br />All of these factors combined in the late 1970's to bring about the bizarre and tragic situation whereby the government of Jimmy Carter basically helped to topple the Somoza government in Nicaragua and the Shah in Iran.  In effect, this eliminated two friendly governments in important strategic locations, governments which while by no means ideal were hardly the two worst human rights offenders even in their own regions.  In the ultimate perversity, it seemed that they were actually targeted by the Carter Administration precisely because they were so closely associated with the United States.  Allies were destroyed, an action made possible because they were not as repressive as other regimes, and replaced by radical totalitarian regimes allied with the Soviet Union, with whom we were at war.<br /><br />Looked at in the abstract like this, the Carter policy seems nearly suicidal.  But Jeane Kirkpatrick traced it to a dangerous faith in Rationalism, as opposed to reliance on Realism, as the basis of foreign policy.  The important thing to note here is that the critique of Rationalism that she offers is very similar to the general conservative critique of modern day liberalism.  The Left has an almost alchemical notion of mankind, believing that any transmutation that they can arrive at rationally can be then be engineered socially.  Able to imagine a utopian world in which Marxist guerilla leaders turn a illiterate, Third World, agrarian, nation into a liberal, egalitarian democracy (moreover, one that would be unfettered by such hoary institutions as the Church, the aristocracy, the military, etc.), they assume such an apotheosis to be imminent.<br /><br />What Kirkpatrick was calling for was a foreign policy grounded in Realism.  Hard experience has demonstrated time and again that revolutionaries who set out to completely transform a society end up imposing an even greater tyranny than the one they replace.  Even more troublesome, they practically never fade away or evolve into democracies (at least they hadn't to that point--the collapse of Eastern European Communism offers a difficult counter argument), they are likely to endure until they in turn are overthrown by conquest from without or violent counterrevolution from within.  For these reasons, we are frequently, if not always, better off opting for the devil we know, the kind of traditional autocratic regimes which, though not democratic, at least offer stability and domestic order, tend to be fairly trustworthy allies, and frequently evolve into democracies.  Kirkpatrick's theory was ultimately vindicated at least in this regard as this was basically the process which occurred in places like Spain, the Philippines, South Africa, Chile, and so on.<br /><br />In fact, the current case of Russia provides a really difficult test of some the implications of theory.  The complete failure of capitalism and democratic institutions to establish themselves in post-Soviet Russia begs the question of whether a brief period of fascist rule there might not have a salutary effect.  First, it would allow central authorities to reestablish the rule of law, both by curbing crime and corruption and by restoring the notion of property rights.  This sort of functioning legal system it now seems fair to say  is an absolutely imperative precursor of capitalism and democracy.  Second, it would provide a period of relative physical security and cultural freedom during which civic institutions could be revitalized--the Church, political parties, corporations, the military, law enforcement, the judiciary, etc.  Difficult as the prospect may be for us to accept, it may well be the case that a healthy Russian democracy will only flower in the wake of a period of authoritarian rule.  This is notto suggest that we should aid Vladimir Putin in oppressing his own people or even that we should turn a blind eye, it is merely to suggest that it might be in our own best interests and ultimately those of the Russian people to allow him some latitude to restore order to that badly disordered nation, even if in so doing he sometimes offends our delicate democratic sensibilities.<br /><br />Other essays in this collection range over a surprisingly wide field, including some perceptive observations on American domestic politics.  The span of years and topics covered means that they don't necessarily fit together into a unified whole, but the dichotomy between reason and realism recurs often enough that they do present a coherent argument in the end.  Thus, in an essay on the failure of the efforts to reform the political parties, she's essentially arguing that the reformers bought into an illusion that they could make the parties adhere to abstract principles, simply because they could imagine this happening.<br /><br />Similarly, in discussing the failure of the New Right to capture either the presidency or the Republican Party nomination in 1976, as theorists like Kevin Phillips, Pat Buchanan, William Rusher, and others expected they would, she points out that their theories were based on a faith that would have required a genuine transformation in the American electorate.  This faith, as the only incremental successes of even Ronald Reagan and the Republican Congress of '94 have demonstrated, was rather misguided.  It may be true--I hope to God it is--that people are reasonably conservative at their core, but it is surely no coincidence that for the past seventy years they have consistently elected candidates who have promised them ever greater government benefits.  While reason can build a case for why that should, even why it must, change, realism requires one to note the stubborn fact.<br /><br />Today these essays are probably little more than a footnote to the history of the Cold War.  But they among the more interesting footnotes.  The fact that Kirkpatrick became a major player in the administration the defeated Communism and won the Cold War, the degree to which her ideas were turned into official U.

At any rate, the author, S. Peter Lewis, and several, if not all, of the folks who helped him build his remarkable treehouse are outdoorsmen and fishermen, such that a book about a building project not infrequently references John Gierach and Nick Lyons. This is fitting because, besides being a bucolic sort of tale anyway, the book resembles nothing so much as a high quality fishing book, complete with watercolors. The attention to detail and design, the way the illustrations and photographs mesh with the text and the entire layout are reminiscent of the work of the great illustrator Barry Moser or of the young angling artist, James Prosek, whose art I like much better than his stories, but who manages to integrate them well. If you look back up at the picture above, you'll see most everything that makes this book so wonderful. First, there's the romance of the task itself, building a two story office around a tree--a feat they accomplished without driving metal into the trunk. Second, there's the characteristically whimsical touch of wrapping a stairwell around another nearby tree. Just as characteristic, as you study the structure and the entryway you'll start saying to yourself, \\"How'd they do that?\\" in the book the question becomes, \\"Okay, we had the bright idea, now how do we do it?\\" Too, you see the roots plunging deep into the soil and the branches reaching skyward. This is a story that's very much anchored in a very special place, Northern New England -- Maine in this case -- where you just aren't terribly surprised to hear a neighbor has embarked on such a foolhardy effort and sort of hope he needs help so you can satisfy your curiosity about how he's doing as well as have a hand in completing the thing. Last, there's the quality of the art work itself, both detailed enough to draw you into the process and lovely enough to awe you. Yes, I suspect you can figure out whether you'll like this book or not just by how you react to that picture. And, if you've a soul, I'm not sure how you can help but react quite favorably.<br /><br />Though we're way behind on reviews I couldn't help reading the book as soon as I opened it. The art, mostly by T.B.R. Walsh, draws you in so much you feel like you're part of the project. The story, as told by Mr. Lewis, is as much about family and friends and neighbors working together and having joyous adventures and misadventures as it is about the nuts and bolts -- actually, mortise and tenons -- of the construction work. The treehouse was very much a collaborative effort and the book is so accessible that the reader becomes almost a collaborator. It's the nature of our winters up here and of the type of building they were doing that most of the work took place in the good weather months, and Mr. Lewis would find himself in the colder times leafing through his notebooks and examining plans daydreaming about the treehouse. I can hardly wait to pick the book up again on some frigid February day and enjoy the whole experience over again. Obviously we recommend this one most heartily, but in particular it seems like it would be a perfect gift book, especially for someone who likes tinkering around their house or anyone who appreciates beautiful books.the art work itself, both detailed enough to draw you into the process and lovely enough to awe you.

Mr. Camilleri's Sicily is just as thoroughly corrupt as you'd expect it to be and no one much seems to mind, other than Montalbano, who isn't about to let everyone else's eagerness to look away stop him from solving the murder of a respected local politician. The opportunity to let it slide by is ample, as it's not even apparent at first that a crime was committed, but the fact that the body was found in a trash yard that's a notorious pick-up spot for whores is sufficiently out of the victim's public character that the Inspector starts digging.<br /><br />The particular strengths of the book are the setting that Camilleri brings to life -- not least by taunting us with the vittles Montalbano enjoys -- and the witty character of the Inspector, as well as his becoming determination to see justice done, even if he has to bend the rules himself on occasion.	2005-09-28

Thompson's 1966 book Hell's Angels is a rather tedious ode to the repellent bikers and their supposed ethos that is redeemed only at the very end when they beat the stuffing out of the author and make an obvious hash of everything he's written up to that point. Chris Verrill is an altogether different man than Mr. Thompson was--it seems fair to say he's even one of the good men contemplated by his title--and this is an altogether different book than Thompson's. It details the world trip Mr. Verrill took in the wake of 9-11, seeking to start up an educational project in Afghanistan on behalf of the Pacifica Rotary Club. But the Mr. Verrill who sets out on this journey does have something of the innocence and naivety of a Candide and by journey's end has had a hefty dose of reality beaten into him. Good men may be required to do something to combat evil in the world, but that doesn't mean that the world will accommodate them by getting rid of red tape, bureaucracy, and other forms of foolishness.<br /><br />One of the chief attractions of the book is the pleasant demeanor and sunny outlook on life that Mr. Verrill brings to his quest. Though not blind to America's faults he is confident that we mean well even in the more controversial aspects of the War on Terror. He's not a George Bush supporter, but is also unwilling to disavow him and the Administration's attempts to liberalize the Middle East. He'd prefer that we'd had the U.N. imprimatur for the Iraq war, but no doubt that it's worth deposing Saddam. The many misunderstandings of America by the people he meets genuinely pain him, just as their own cultures fascinate him. He seems certain that if only we could all get together and know each other better we'd all get along.<br /><br />The first half of the book is somewhat overlong, as we spend too much time preparing for the trip, traveling across America and then in Africa, the Mediterranean and even Central Europe. However, once Mr. Verrill gets to India and begins traveling to Pakistan and working on the project in earnest the book becomes more focused. It's here too that the author gets a dismaying education in just how difficult folks can make it to do even a good deed. The best portions of the book actually come at Mr. Verrill's own expense as his can-do attitude bumps up against bureaucrats and regulations that say no-you-can't or, at least, not-so-fast. The book ends up being a tragicomic variation on The Quiet American and an enjoyable read even if not quite the one the author hoped to give us.India and begins traveling to Pakistan and working on the project in earnest the book becomes more focused.

Even Alaska used to host a Summer League, where they could play in sunlight most of the night. But Kevin Nelson mines the especially rich past of baseball in California from its earliest days as a state--in the 1850s--until its five professional franchises were all in place in 1969. Along the way he dips into the game's forays into radio, tv, and film; the last days of Ty Cobb; Jackie Robinson's emergence at UCLA; and on and on. Mr. Nelson's style is very conversational and he wends from topic to topic. If you're looking for someone to dot every \\"i\\" and cross every \\"t\\" or to give a rigid day-by-day history, he's not your man. But if you think you'd enjoy listening to a tale spinner meander around the Golden State and tell the stories that catch his fancy--accompanied by a remarkable collection of photos--this is a book you'll enjoy immensely.	2005-08-24

The author, Charles Gidley Wheeler, coincidentally wrote a later episode in the series, My Name is Anna Wiseman, one that was less brutal and mercenary than the typical entry but betrayed a deep moral seriousness at a time when such was not fashionable in the West (it was shown on June 30, 1980). Mr. Wheeler -- like the creator of The Sandbaggers, Ian Mackintosh -- is a former officer in the Royal Navy and in this novel he builds his story towards what was, paradoxically, both one of the pivotal moments in the decline of British global power and a little remembered event: the mass mutiny of the Atlantic Fleet at Invergordon in September 1931.though the immediate cause of the mutiny was a Depression era pay cut, Mr. Wheeler shows that the men had many other grievances that had built up over the years until such unrest was almost inevitable.<br /><br />The novel provides perspective on the Navy and these events through the characters of Frank Jannaway, a servant's son in the household of retired naval officer Jervis Yarrow, whose son, Roddy, brutalizes Frank and whose daughter, Anita, is infatuated with him. Jannaway is a bright boy and shows promise on the piano, so Mr. Yarrow undertakes to pay for his schooling. Roddy is a conniving and thoroughly rotten young man who eventually uses Anita's indiscretions to get Frank thrown out of school and the house and into the Navy as an enlisted man. Meanwhile, Roddy's father gets him out of one scrape after another and advances him far beyond his abilities as a Naval officer. Frank and Anita are reunited years later and begin a love affair that is fated to end tragically, but not as tragically as the reunion of Frank and Roddy aboard HMS Winchester in 1931.<br /><br />Mr. Wheeler's tale is very dark, marching from one unpleasantness to the next, and the characters, other than Frank Jannaway himself, are generally rather unlikable. But it's a brisk and quite readable book and the history of the mutiny is fascinating., and the characters, other than Frank Jannaway himself, are generally rather unlikable.

His books seemed more realistic because the cops were more recognizably like us, with girlfriends, wives, and families and problems with bureaucratic politics. His large cast of regulars allowed him to develop multiple storylines and to shift his focus around the station house. To the extent that there was a central figure it would have to be Steve Carella, earnest, morally centered, with a deaf wife, Teddy.<br /><br />Carella is on the case here, partnered with Bert Kling, who's been the naive junior member of the team for half a century now. But pride of place is given to Detective Oliver Wendell Weeks, the \\"Fat Ollie\\" of the title. Part of the delight of the books is that over time they've become completely anachronistic. Mr. McBain kept writing his characters as he'd invented them, but let the background events reflect the present day. So 9-11 and the war in Afghanistan are frequent touchpoints in the story but Fat Ollie is like Archie Bunker before Norman Lear got ahold of him. The idea that a cop could get away in the year 2002 with being as vociferously racist, sexist, and homophobic as Weeks has remained is obviously ludicrous. However, it's quite amusing to watch him cut a swathe through politically correct times.<br /><br />The mystery involves the shooting death of a city councilmen who was about to declare for mayor and the theft of the novel that Fat Ollie had just finished. The murder is pretty stock stuff, but the police author plot gives Mr. McBain an opportunity to riff on the very genre he invented and wield a rather poison pen. At one point Ollie meets yet another cop who's written a novel of his own:<br /><br />That's what we need, all right, Ollie thought. Another novel about police work. There used to be no novels about police work at all. Then, all of a sudden -- God knows who or what the influence might have been -- every sh[odd]y town in America had a fictitious character working out of a detective squadroom. To look at all these police novels out there, you'd think every hamlet in America was overrun with crime. Dumb little village has a population of six hundred people, according to these novels there are murders being committed there every hour on the hour.<br /><br />Even as it drips with a fair amount of bitterness -- Mr. McBain even wanted to sue the creators of Hill Street Blues for pilfering his ideas -- that's awfully funny stuff. Doing things like dropping in such metafictional discourse earned the later books a reputation for greater ambition, but the older, more straightforward entries are even more enjoyable.ovel of his own: <br /> <br />That's what we need, all right, Ollie thought.

But, there's no subject about which I make less pretense to comprehension than women in general and young women in particular. Indeed, a mother, a sister, a wife, and a daughter have done little more than confuse the issue so thoroughly that I long ago gave up trying to figure them out. So I'm profoundly unqualified to judge the accuracy of Ms Skolkin-Smith's portrayal of a 14-year old American girl's coming-of-age in early 1960's Jerusalem. Liana Bialik's mother has brought her and her sister back to Israel, from Westchester County, NY, after the suicide of their father. There they are surrounded by the mother's past -- helping the Haganah to win Israeli independence from the British -- and by the mystery of the much-disputed ancient city. Becoming an adult is never a simple matter, but for Liana it's made no easier by the smothering affection and odd character of her mother nor the tense geo-political setting in which she finds herself:<br /><br />My mother was in her element here, I thought, it was Israel and hot. Maybe she could be happy here, not need me so much. She could wear her tent dresses, and walk barelegged, with her kerchiefs tied around her neck. She could decide dressing any morning that she was not in need of underpants, or any other undergarment. No one would care or judge her as they did in Katonah.<br /><br />The setting sun was a broad, magnified flame, widening and, staring outward towards the distant field and woods, I slowly summed up all the other obstacles in my way to going to Paris: my mother, the stifling, coarse country that would watch everything I did as if we were in a police state somewhere, the fact that I had no more than a hundred dollars and a few lira saved, and beyond the garden, the small pine forest and few Jewish houses, raw barbed wire made it impossible to skip off the property, and then go up further towards the Jordanian hills. And even though the wire was old now and weather-eaten, there were buried mines in the field beyond it.<br /><br />The story of how Liana escapes this claustrophobic atmosphere and navigates those figurative and literal minefields scared the bejeebies out of me as a dad, but makes for a good moody read.

Along the way he offers intelligent discussion of questions like what to read, whether to write in your books, and so forth, but mostly he encourages you to read and, importantly, listen to books, to make room for them in your life, no matter how busy.<br /><br />It's good that the book is brief, because he very intentionally makes you want to put his down and move on to a classic, but two topics he might have touched on are finding books and picking versions of books. For the true bibliophile there's no better way to spend a Saturday than prowling through the book sales that almost every public library in America hosts, and many a church, retirement home, and college. The quality and condition varies wildly, but they're generally cheap and plentiful and there are always treasures lurking. The version of a book you buy can be important because they too vary so much. As John Nesbitt pointed out years ago in Megatrends, books will survive the electronic age because we enjoy the tactile sensation associated with them. Buy books that feel good in your hands and appeal to the eye. As I've gotten older I've found that means larger paperbacks instead of pocket size -- or even hardcovers if they're affordable (which those book sales we mentioned certainly help with) -- and books with larger type (though not Large Type) whenever possible. Never mind your eyesight and your age, it's just easier to read books with bigger print when you're not sure where you'll be reading: a plane, a waiting room, an easy chair but with a squirming kid in your lap, etc.. Especially when you're reading the classics, it's also worthwhile to look for editions with interesting introductory or biographical essays or even end notes and footnotes. And be sure that if the original was in a foreign language that the edition you buy is a good translation, which can make all the difference in the world as to whether you enjoy the book or not. For instance, the Modern Library is publishing a very nice series of classics, one of which I found recently is Stendahl's The Red and the Black translated by the great Burton Raffel. I've always gotten bogged down in older translations of the book, but as it Mr. Raffel who rendered the version of Don Quijote that I finally appreciated, I look forward to giving Stendahl another shot. Add in the intro by Diane Johnson, the uniformly handsome presentation the publisher gives the books, and the ridiculously low price, and you've got a must.<br /><br />Mr. Leveen does share one anecdote that both discusses the quality of the edition you buy and captures his love of books; perhaps we'll close with it:<br /><br />On a trip to Amherst, Massachusetts, Lori and I toured Emily Dickinson's home. I bought a nice hardcover volume of her poetry in the gift shop and inside it wrote the date that we bought it, then taped in the ticket stub from the tour. Walking in Dickinson's yard with Lori that lovely summer afternoon, I picked up a perfect oak leaf from the grass and put that inside, too. Now our book is not simply any copy of Emily Dickinson's poetry, but a special one with particulars, and even a leaf from the very yard that inspired her.<br /><br />Doesn't that make you want to grab a book that matters to you and start reading?or biographical essays or even end notes and footnotes.

Everything ordered and secure. Prayer and devotion, the summer timetable then the winter, unchanging, centuries old. The Benedictines have given me such a life as I could never have had in the world; a ship's chandler's son raised to abbot.\\" He gave a sad flicker of a smile. \\"It's not just myself I mourn for, Commissioner; it's the tradition, the life. Already these last two years order has started to break down. We all used to have the same beliefs, think the same way, but already the reforms have brought discord, disagreement. And now murder. Dissolution,\\" he whispered. \\"Dissolution\\"<br /><br />It's 1537 and the king's divorce is, of course, Henry VIII's, which brought with it the disestablishment of the Catholic Church in England. Now, Henry and his vicar general, Thomas Cromwell, having survived the rebellion led by Robert Aske, are dissolving Church properties and adding their wealth to the royal treasury. But they require legal pretexts for doing so. When a royal commissioner is murdered while looking for such cause in the monastery of Scarnsea, Cromwell sends his fellow reformer Matthew Shardlake, \\"the sharpest hunchback in the courts of England,\\" to investigate the killing and shut the place down.<br /><br />The book is kind of a Name of the Rose for the rest of us. The theological and political conflicts at its core are far more accessible to a modern reader and the questions it raises, like those in the paragraph above, still haunt. If the zealous Shardlake finds much of the corruption he expects to find in a Papist institution, he is also given cause to doubt the very Reformationist project he serves.<br /><br />Shardlake makes for a compelling hero, though his sidekick is annoying and is happily written out of what looks likely to be a series at novel's end. The atmosphere is tense and often quite frightening. The world of a 16th century monastery is convincingly rendered. And both the mystery and the theo-political drama are well-handled.

Though the heyday of the teams came in vaudeville, Golden Age movies, and early television, those of us in the Baby Boom generation -- especially those of us born later on, who grew up with television -- were probably more thoroughly exposed than any other demographic group and seem most likely to love this book. We got to watch The Little Rascals, Three Stooges, I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, and even Amos 'n Andy in syndication every afternoon when we got home from school.  Abbot and Costello was a Sunday morning staple and Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, and Hope and Crosby's Road movies made perfect cheap filler for non-network broadcast stations. There were enough variety shows still going that older teams and solo comedians would still show up from time to time. We may not have gotten all the jokes, but we spent an awful lot of time laughing at their varied antics. In &lt;u>Mixed Nuts&lt;/u> Lawrence J. Epstein treats us not just to a history of these acts but a sociological dissertation on American humor.  The anecdote and joke-filled history, though brisk and though it extends several decades too far, is informative and fun, but it's the context he adds that makes the book fascinating.<br /><br />No one will agree with all his analyses, and sometimes he's obviously reaching in order to give comedy acts a significance they just don't warrant, but the text is so rich in ideas and so thought-provoking that the few misfires are easily forgiven. Consider, for example, this discussion of George Burns and Gracie Allen:<br /><br />[C]omic timing was a crucial part of their professional craft. In comedy, the straight man's \\"timing\\" refers to his ability to wait to speak until the laughter has peaked, receded, and finally stopped so that audiences can hear the next line, but not wait for so long after it has stopped that audiences might get confused or bored. The comic's timing refers to the response after the straight man has finished a line. The term \\"beat\\" is used to measure the pause between lines, and it and the \\"pace,\\" or speed of the delivery, had to be perfect. The comic in the team needed an appropriate appearance and funny lines. Both the straight man and the comic needed rhythm.<br /><br />Burns and Allen were experts at all of this. They knew which words to emphasize. They learned to control their voices. The staccato rhythm of their delivery was perfect. Other performers would have spoken too slowly or too fast or fallen out of the rhythm, which had to be maintained with each line and each silence. They even used pauses well. Gracie would giggle, an infectious sound and a prompt for even further audience laughter. George's repetition of much of the material was also crucial to the pacing, allowing the audience to grasp the premise precisely and be set up by George for the line to follow. It was impossible for Burns to be a comedian in such a structure. Any joke he interjected would break the patented Burns and Allen patter.<br /><br />Note how deftly he establishes the general concepts he'll need throughout the book, but illustrates with a specific team, describing what made them masters of the form.<br /><br />Likewise, here he discusses an irony that I've always found especially delicious, that two of the most conservative men in Hollywood politically were also the great innovators of post-modernism, years before academics and intellectuals imagined they were inventing a new phenomena:<br /><br />Beyond creating an alternative to classic teams, Hope and Crosby signaled the decline of the traditional comedy team in two ways. First, they helped erase the line between the two worlds created by classic comedy teams.They developed the fourth and final model of the relationship between reality and the comic world created by teams, which negated the three previous models developed by Burns and Allen, Laurel and Hardy, and Abbott and Costello. In this new model, there was no necessity for one member of a team to have a tenuous hold on reality while another character brought the team back to the real world, or for the team to create a fantasy world in which the team members banded together to overcome a strange, hostile reality represented by an outside straight man, or a team in which a straight man represented a tricky world seeking to con us.<br /><br />Hope and Crosby developed a realistic humor that mocked the illusory world their movie producers had arranged for them. [...]<br /><br />[I]f you didn't take the real world too seriously there was no great need to create a fantasy comic world. Such an approach required a lack of sentimentality, an ability to avoid so strong an attachment to any person or place that you couldn't face the inevitable disappointments inherent in those people and places.<br /><br />The earlier portion of that is bang on, but by the end seems quite wrong.  Rather it is precisely because we are realistic about the inevitability of being disappointed by people and places that we can find the disappointments comic when they come, rather than tragic.  Therein lies the secret to the notion that all comedy is conservative.<br /><br />Let's end with one more, a look at Ralph Kramden that let's us see The Honeymooners in an almost religious context:<br /><br />The character goes through a transformation in each show --  but then returns to his old form for the next show, only to be transformed again. Audiences wanted to see that transformation -- that change from the angry loser, the guy with a thousand get-rich ideas that all fail, that yells at his wife and his neighbor, that never seems to get ahead -- to the Chaplin-like, sad and sympathetic soul who is touched by love and, in Gleason's view, by grace and somehow finds the means to express it. As an episode was about to close, he often gazed lovingly at his wife and said, \\"Alice, you're the greatest.\\"<br /><br />Audiences saw in Ralph's transformation hopes for redemption in their own marriages and lives.<br /><br />That's good stuff.  Even if you disagree you're forced to grapple with what you think is wrong about it, an edifying exercise in itself.  I suspect though that as you read you'll find more you agree with than disagree, and while it would have been better to end the story before we get to the point of considering Rowan and Martin and Cheech and Chong to be peers of the greats, all of it worthwhile.created by classic comedy teams.

He's written hundreds of technical papers and several books on Mars exploration, testified before Congress and founded the Mars Society. He'd seem to have a pretty full plate. But over the past couple years he's turned his hand to fiction and now bids fair to become a Renaissance man.<br /><br />Mr. Zubrin first fictional turn was, not surprisingly, a science fiction novel, First Landing, about a trip to Mars. It sported cover blurbs from the likes of Kevin J. Anderson, Kim Stanley Robinson and Gregory Benford and got good reviews. For his next effort he stuck to science fiction, but departed quite radically from the subject of Mars. The Holy Land is a delicious dystopic satire that does to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict what Orwell did to the Russian Revolution. If the topic was unexpected, even less predictable was the deft touch he demonstrated for comedy. You couldn't help but admire the courage and skill with which he exposed the inherent absurdity of such a deadly serious situation.<br /><br />This time around Dr. Zubrin has been even more adventurous, offering up not just a tale of the American Revolution and the archetypal traitor but he's rendered it as a play to boot. The tragedy of Benedict Arnold has always fascinated--a genuine hero of the revolution for his roles at Fort Ticonderoga, Saratoga, and the assault on Quebec who, physically wounded in combat and psychologically embittered after quarreling with the Continental Congress about rank and money, eventually tried to surrender West Point and George Washington and his staff to the British. The plot was foiled when Arnold's British \\"controller,\\" Major John Andre, was captured with incriminating plans on his person. Arnold defected to the British and served them ably fighting against the Americans, but Andre was hanged.<br /><br />Dr. Zubrin does take some liberties with history, mostly for purposes of sketching in the various characters' motivations. He makes Peggy Shippen the key to the whole affair. A friend of Andre's in real life, Dr. Zubrin makes her Andre's paramour and a devoted Loyalist, her marriage to Arnold little more than part of a grand nefarious scheme. In addition, Andre is at least implied to have been General Henry Clinton's lover as well as his chief of intelligence--he was certainly closer to the difficult Clinton than most. Arnold, meanwhile, is played as a man insecure about his modest social background --Shippen refers to him contemptuously as a drugstore \\"clerk\\" -- and strongly attracted to the more stylish and aristocratic \\"Tory Girls\\" than the homier and homelier \\"Patriot Girls.\\" Shippen and Andre use this and his disappointed ambition to ensnare him in the plot. Historical purists may be upset and, in truth, while some of these interpretations can at least find some support in the record others are pure speculation. Nonetheless, you do require some motives to drive the drama and Dr. Zubrin makes these serve well.<br /><br />As always in a historical fiction characters are called upon to explain the setting and the events of the day, which can be pedantic and unnatural but is pretty much unavoidable. George Washington has a walk-on in which he's impossibly noble, except that we know of the instances where he acted just so in real life. There are a fair number of asides to the audience and it's not altogether clear how they'd work out on stage, but they do help reveal the internal thoughts of the dramatis personae. One nice touch is the presence of several period songs (though sadly not my favorite, Chester). Best of all, Dr. Zubrin once again demonstrates a real facility with comedy. In particular, he gives Peggy Shippen such a sharp tongue that several of her comments are laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />The leaders of the Revolution were themselves shaped to some considerable degree by works like Joseph Addison's tragedy, Cato. How fitting then of Dr. Zubrin to pay them tribute with a play of his own. It's delightful.n to pay them tribute with a play of his own. It's delightful.	2005-06-14

Jos&eacute; Maria Lacambra-Loizu, a native of the Basque region, has taken this rich history and turned it into an epic novel reminiscent of James A. Michener.  Mr. Lacambra-Loizu accepts the version of the Basque past that holds they are directly descended from Cro-Magnon man--they do have a language and blood types that are unique--and follows as adventurous Ice Age bands trek from the Caucasus to their eventual homeland in northern Spain, in the Western Pyrenees, along the Bay of Biscay. Once settled they interact over the coming centuries with such historical figures as Julius Caesar, Charlemagne, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard the Lionheart, and, of course, the kings and queens of Spain and defend their chosen land against Celts, Romans, Franks, Moors and Spaniards.<br /><br />The strengths and weaknesses of the book are much of a piece with Michener's works and any fan of his is likely to enjoy this one.  Mr. Lacambra-Loizu uses the device of plunking down successive members of one family in the midst of the action.  The format is necessarily episodic and just when you're getting to know the main character you're about to leave him behind. However, the goings on around them are so interesting as to make up for such quibbles. It's no coincidence though that the best portion of the book is an extended visit with Inaki, a young knight who ends up going Crusading in the Holy Land with Richard. is the most fully developed of the characters and his tale the most compelling overall. The best set piece is probably the defeat of Charlemagne in the pass of Roncesvalles, which later formed the basis of the poem  Chanson de Roland, though credit therein was given to the Moors rather than the Basques.<br /><br />It's a longish book -- big enough to take to the beach this summer -- as befits its topic and the sweep of thousands of years.  Still, it cuts off rather abruptly in and leaps ahead to the present. Presumably Mr. Lacambra-Loizu is working on a sequel, because there's plenty of Basque history still to be told and its recent past is just as event-filled. This fine effort will certainly get you started though.e Moors rather than the Basques. <br /> <br /> <br />It's a longish book -- big enough to take to the beach this summer -- as befits its topic and the sweep of thousands of years.

Mr. Alverson so consciously tries to evoke Chandler that it's hard at first to figure out when the story is supposed to be set--though in the end it turns out to be contemporary. Adding to one's confusion is the anomaly of hero Joe Goodey referring to blacks as spades, which even in 1975 was frowned upon. At any rate, Goodey is thrown off of the San Francisco police department after accidentally shooting the mayor's uncle, but is given an expedited private eye's license when a stripper he knew turns up dead, with the mayor's name in her little black book.

It's shaped something like an anaconda that ate a calf a few weeks ago. There's several thousand years of Jewish pre-history, then the brief span of Christ's birth, mission, crucifixion, and resurrection, then a couple thousand years of epilogue. After all, what--before or after--can compare with the story of the Savior?<br /><br />But if we take the longer view we begin to see just how remarkable the rest of the story is. Consider that at the time of the Crucifixion Christ was denied by even his own followers, a sect within an oppressed minority religion in a discrete portion of the mighty Roman Empire. Yet, from these rather inauspicious beginnings grew a religion of near 2 billion people, or one in three people in the world. For the believer this may have an air of inevitability--after all, how surprised can we be that the Word prevailed? However, even we must marvel that it spread so far, so fast. Here, surely, is a story worth telling.<br /><br />Well, James D. Snyder details the years from A.D. 30-71 in a masterful narrative that follows the post-Christ missions of the Apostles against the backdrop (though it's often in the foreground) of a hostile Rome and equally hostile Judea, which were meanwhile in conflict one with the other. He weaves the three strands--Roman, Jewish, Christian--into one compelling tale that sweeps the reader through a pivotal, but easily overlooked, period in history. If the madness of Rome makes for disturbing but fascinating reading and the heroic struggle of the Jews proves ultimately futile, the successive martyrdoms of the Apostles pack an emotional punch. the climax, though not quite the end, of the book comes when Peter tries to escape from his captors in Rome but meets Christ on the road and asks: Domine, quo vadis? (\\"Lord, where are you going?):<br /><br />  Jesus replied: \\"I am going to be crucified once again.\\"<br /><br />  Then Peter repeated himself: \\"Lord, you will be crucified again?<br /><br />  And Christ replied: \\"Yes, I will be crucified again.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Then, Lord,\\" answered Peter, \\"I am returning to follow you.\\"<br /><br />  No sooner had Peter turned around than Jesus vanished. After weeping and collecting his thoughts, Peter understood that the words were meant for his own martyrdom, that the Lord would suffer with him as he would all who lived and died in his name. And so, Peter, bursting with new strength, returned to the prison glorifying God and singing praises to the risen Christ. [...]<br /><br />  It is said that Peter asked only one thing of his executioners: \\"I beg you crucify me in this way--head down--and no other way.\\" And he explained that he was not worthy to be executed as had his lord and master.<br /><br />That's strong stuff and goes some way to explaining the survival and triumph of the Gospel.<br /><br />We got no small number of self-published books through here and titles from smaller publishers.

For the most part Mr. Ehrman treats the '80s as a transitional era, as America went from a failing industrial economy to the exuberant information economy of the '90s and from a near universal acceptance of liberal New Deal/Great Society orthodoxy to the widespread belief, even among Third Way Democrats, in conservative approaches to social problems and the use of free market solutions to provide social services and fuel economic growth. Combined with for the most part ignoring foreign affairs this enables him to take a more sober look at Ronald Reagan than do many of the reverent analysts on the Right and the hysterical critics on the Left. In our hyperpartisan era, such dispassion is somewhat refreshing, but it does seem to make Mr. Ehrman overly cautious in offering assessments, as if giving President Reagan much credit for anything would betray an unforgivable bias. Too often that leads to a certain sense in the book that the changes that took place in the '80s were inevitable and Mr. Reagan just happened to be in office while they went on around him. Surely there's a middle ground between claiming that the Gipper walked on water and pretending that a second Jimmy Carter term, would have been indistinguishable from Reagan's first?<br /><br />That said, there's one theme of the book that Mr. Ehrman handles especially well, a leitmotif that he traces through the decade to devastating effect: the complete failure of liberalism generally and the Democrats in particular to come to grips with the fact that conservatism was being re-established as a credible political philosophy in America, perhaps even its dominant one. Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill; Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd; presidential candidates Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis; pundits and academics like Robert Reich, Lester Thurow, Paul Kennedy, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.; are all portrayed as just flailing around, denying by turns the importance of Reagan's victory, the potential that Reaganomics could revive the economy, the possibility of prevailing in the Cold War, even the future of America. The occasional reformist voice on the Left--a Gary Hart or Ira Magaziner--was overwhelmed as: \\"Liberal intellectuals showed themselves still beset with economic anxieties and unable to break free from past perspectives, fear of foreigners [mostly Japan and the Soviets], or unproductive abstractions.\\" Mr. Ehrman depicts the '80s, quite accurately, as a lost decade for liberalism. Many of its legislative achievements and the changes it had brought to institutions endured at decade's end, but they'd lost their intellectual justification. Significantly, when a Democrat did finally win back the presidency, it was a Southern moderate who ran against liberalism as much as against conservatism and still only managed 43% of the vote. Even Bill Clinton though seems not to have learned this lesson and by governing to the Left in his first two years lost long term control of Congress for the Democrats for the first time since the Great Depression and the party proceeded to nominate two garden variety liberals, Al Gore and John Kerry, who lost to George W. Bush, who ran well to the Right of where Ronald Reagan had governed. It will be possible for succeeding authors to Mr. Ehrman's theme into the '90s and well into the '00s. this gives the book an enduring significance, despite its weaknesses.nger, Jr.; are all portrayed as just flailing around, denying by turns the importance of Reagan's victory, the potential that Reaganomics could revive the economy, the possibility of prevailing in the Cold War, even the future of America.

All the more remarkable then that one of the great adventure authors of all time actually won a Nobel and somewhat tragic that so few have read him in recent decades. But Henryk Sienkiewicz has made something of a comeback and it could not be more welcome.<br /><br />Sienkiewicz is the great author of Poland--indeed, to some extent his works are said to have created and helped to maintain the strong Polish identity that prevailed through the troubled 20th Century. When his books were first published -- mostly late in the 19th Century -- the English translations were done by Teddy Roosevelt's friend Jeremiah Curtin and, whether they were adequate for their time, they are are terribly dated now and have served to put off potential readers. Add in the fact that neither the Nazis nor the Communists had much interest in fostering Polish patriotism and you've the recipe for lost classics. But then, fittingly as the Iron Curtain was crumbling, Hippocrene Books commissioned a new translation of his greatest works, The Trilogy and Quo Vadis?, by the highly-regarded Polish novelist W. S. Kuniczak, and these eminently readable versions won Sienkiewicz a modern audience. New translations of other works followed, then a terrific film version of In Desert and Wilderness, and a massive Polish television adaptation of the Trilogy. Suddenly we've a surfeit of riches and some catching up to do.<br /><br />If you're just starting out it might be wise to begin with Quo Vadis?, a stand alone tale of Christians in Rome that really deserves a fresh film treatment. But it's well worth your time to dive into the Trilogy, the first volume of which is the magnificent With Fire and Sword. Set in 1647, amidst a Cossack uprising against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, it tells the story of a young Polish patriot and hero, Yan Skshetuski, and his love for the beautiful Helen, who is also coveted the brutal Bohun, who fights with the rebels. Pan Yan's twin tales give us epic history and grand romance, while his compatriots offer comic relief. There's his wily servant, Zjendjan, whose semi-faithful service somehow keeps lining his own pocket. There's the mopey giant Pan Longinus, who has sworn a vow of chastity until he lives up to the example of his forebears and takes off the heads of three enemy soldiers with one swing of his massive battle sword. There's Pan Michal Wolodyjowski, whose bravery and feistiness belie his diminutive stature. And, best of all, there's the Falstaffian Pan Zagloba, who makes up in drinking capacity, gluttony, and biting wit what he lacks in zeal for battle, as he keeps his one good eye peeled for threats to his corpulent frame.<br /><br />It'll take you a hundred to a hundred and fifty pages to orient yourself and get used to the odd names and nicknames, but the subsequent thousand pages go by far too fast. It's one of those stories you don't ever want to end.o the Trilogy, the first volume of which is the magnificent With Fire and Sword.

That makes it all the more remarkable that Mr. McCalman's is a work of non-fiction. Giuseppe Balsamo, Count Cagliostro (1743-95) led a life filled with love affairs, cons, duels, frauds, pimping, scandals, encounters with the famous and infamous, and shrouded it all in so much mystery--especially Masonic mythology--that it has invited artists from Mozart to Dumas to Goethe to William Blake to Umberto Eco draw upon it for their works. But as this fascinating narrative biography amply demonstrates the topic is nowhere near exhausted.<br /><br />You can get some sense of Cagliostro's intriguing multiple personalities just from the chapter titles--Freemason; Necromancer; Shaman; Copt; Prophet; Rejuvenator; Heretic--and the Epilogue, appropriately subtitled: Immortal. As the chapters suggest, to some degree, Cagliostro represents the persistence of the supernatural and mystical at the very center of the Age of Reason. Stripped down to essentials that can't possibly begin to do the story justice: Giuseppe Balsamo was low born in Sicily, but styling himself Count Cagliostro, loaning out his beguiling wife, Seraphina, and claiming magical healing powers and both a legitimate background in Freemasonry and a bogus one in an occult Egyptian-rite Freemasonry was able to gain entree to the best social circles in Europe, though he proceeded to be chased from Russia by Catherine the Great, imprisoned in the Bastille by Louis XVI over the notorious \\"Affair of the Necklace,\\" and died in the prison he'd been sent to by the Inquisition. If all of that sounds entertaining be assured that Mr. McCalman makes it very much so.<br /><br />However, in the end there's a dark side to the tale too, for the author convincingly argues that Cagliostro did much to make possible the myriad conspiracy theories that did so much damage to Europe in the ensuing decades and some of which persist to this day. Mr. McCalman notes that, on the one hand, popular writers conflated him into the mythical Wandering Jew and made him \\"a fashionably moody and anguished rebel, tilting against oppressions of the spirit\\" while, on the other, his presence lurks behind many of the delusions about Masons and Illuminati secretly controlling the world and says:<br /><br />  \\"It would be unfair to blame Cagliostro for the actions of mythologizers, but Umberto Eco has shown that the idea of Masonic conspiracy has borne some terrible fruit. During the early twentieth, Jews rather than Masons became the prime target. By the time it reached a bitter young man in Vienna called Adolph Hitler, the idea had taken a new and monstrous shape. Templars, Illuminati, and Egyptian Masons had given way to the Protocols of Zion, the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and the world conspiracy of Judaism. Whatever one may think of Cagliostro, it is devastating to think that he was in some way a conduit of the Holocaust.\\"<br /><br />Even after we grant that some of that is simply an author stretching his subject a tad thin to make him seem more relevant than he might in reality be, it still tells us something, as does Cagliostro's whole career, about the disturbing credulousness that fits so comfortably with modernity's claim to have escaped the superstitions of religion for the bright new world of Reason. The interplay of this theme with Cagliostro's extraordinary life and Mr. McCalman's accessible story-telling makes for an eminently readable and often thought-provoking book.damage to Europe in the ensuing decades and some of which persist to this day.

276071:US	52173832	R1U7ECIE70EXTG	0895260190	388961491	South Park Conservatives: The Revolt Against Liberal Media Bias	Books	5	234	341	N	N	All Humor is Conservative	Leave us start with two admissions and a warning. First, I know the author of this volume, Brian C. Anderson, in the way we now know one another in the Internet Age, and so am not an impartial source as regards his book. A couple years ago he was one of the first editors to contact us and suggest that we blog about stories from his fine publication, City Journal. This struck us then as a very smart use of a relatively new instrumentality to create buzz for a magazine that deserved it. That there are still major newspapers and other publications that haven't figured out the benefits they could reap from having folks steer readers to them for free only makes Mr. Anderson seem further ahead of the curve. In addition, his own essays are uniformly excellent and one, We're Not Losing the Culture Wars Anymore (Brian C. Anderson, Autumn 2003, City Journal), was one of the best pieces of recent years on the rise of a conservative media counter-culture. When he decided to expand on that essay in this book it really couldn't help but be a good read and I didn't approach it with anything like an open mind, nevermind skepticism. Just so you know.<br /><br />Second, despite my anticipation, I did feel some trepidation at the subtitle, with its prominent mention of \\"liberal media bias.\\" Let's face it, while they served their purpose well, we don't much need another diatribe about the distortions and dominance of the liberal media. That one's been done to death. Likewise, the boxing-gloved Kapow! graphic on the cover raised some concern that Mr. Anderson might have fallen prey to the triumphalism that plagues so many on the Internet, who think they've already outdone Gutenberg in terms of the impact of their medium on society. After all, tripping up a few lightweights like Trent Lott, Dan Rather, Jayson Blair, and Jeff Gannon doesn't quite equal being a driving force behind literacy and the Reformation. Happily, Mr. Anderson seems to have been well aware of these potential pitfalls himself. After some introductory remarks, he accepts the liberal media as a given and doesn't squander space dwelling on it. Nor does he so much as suggest that the Right has managed to balance out that bias in recent years. The book is about the revolt against said, but it is very much about a revolt in progress. If new media are providing conservatism with a greater voice in the public square, we're nonetheless still closer to Bunker Hill than to Yorktown.<br /><br />As to the warning, I'd not anticipated just how funny the book would be. In addition to hilarious scenes from South Park itself, Mr. Anderson draws upon the work of Dennis Miller, Scott Ott, Chris Muir, and a host of others--not all of whom would be considered classically conservative--who are using comedy to puncture the pretensions of liberalism. Thus the caution--some of these bits are so funny that your spouse will insist you let him/her read them immediately, and it can be hard to get the book back.<br /><br />Mr. Anderson's thesis is straightforward enough and seemingly incontrovertible--that the Right, which had been shut out of the mainstream media for decades, has mounted a successful insurgency on talk radio, cable television, college campuses, and the Internet (especially the blogosphere) that has given it a much stronger voice in the Culture War than it had before. The warfare remains asymmetrical--the Left, after all, has all three nightly network newscasts and nearly all the major metropolitan dailies, while the Right has only FOX News, the Washington Times, and alternative news services like World Net Daily--but the trends are promising and the free market in particular is a powerful force working in favor of conservatism. Media executives may not care for conservative ideas but they can't ignore things like the popularity of the wildly anti-PC South Park, the success FOX has had largely at CNN's expense, or the fact that Mel Gibson's Passion, which most in Hollywood wouldn't touch, turned out to be a blockbuster. In a country that is divided at least 50/50 between conservatives and liberals, it makes no sense from a purely business standpoint to leave half the consumers unserved. The revolt would appear to have even better days before it.<br /><br />The book offers a fascinating history of the rise of these more conservative media outlets. For instance, Mr. Anderson explains the importance of Ronald Reagan dispensing with the FCC's \\"Fairness Doctrine\\" and the ensuing ascent to prominence of Rush Limbaugh, a figure who he's not uncritical of but does give a central role in the revolt. Who better represents the emergence of a powerful conservative critique in the media than Mr. Limbaugh, who went from being heard on one radio station in Sacramento to generating over $1 billion in revenues on a nationwide network of 600 affiliates with 20 million listeners? Perhaps we can borrow a metaphor Mr. Anderson uses in particular circumstances to describe the entire process he depicts: from rather small beginnings, conservative media has become like \\"samizdat multiplied by orders of magnitude.\\"<br /><br />I do have two quarrels with the book, though neither fatal. As good a job as he does laying out the history of the revolt thus far, Mr. Anderson concludes a bit brusquely. I'd have liked to have him talk a bit more about where he thinks it's all headed and what the import will be. He touches on such questions as he goes along, but a summing up would have been helpful. More than that though, the book could use a more extensive discussion of just why it is that humor is proving such a fertile field for the Right and why liberalism seems unable to contest that ground. He offers a tantalizing clue in passing, but never returns to it:<br /><br />  [T]here's no doubting South Park, joining a long tradition that runs from Aristophanes to Tom Wolfe, exemplifies the essence of satire--\\"the comic as weapon,\\" as social thinker Peter Berger describes it in his book on the comic imagination. Satire, Berger writes, has four criteria: fantasy (often grotesque), a firm moral standpoint, an object of attack, and an educational purpose. South Park meets all four.<br /><br />Merely the idea that satire must proceed from a \\"firm moral standpoint\\" suggests something of why the Right is able to make such good use of it and the tolerant/moral relativist Left isn't. Consider too the old aphorism that: to a liberal the world is a tragedy, to a conservative a comedy. The grotesque nature of satire will then be humorous to the Right while it will offend the Left to be asked to laugh at the travails of others, a violation of the political-correctness that holds we can find nothing funny in the human condition. There's rich territory here. Indeed, even liberals have noted the Left/Right humor gap--Bubble Wrap: The Nation vs. The Weekly Standard (John Powers, 8/30/02, LA Weekly)--and we've argued that All Humor is Conservative. Mr. Anderson needn't have gone to that extreme, but the role of comedy is so central to the revolution he writes about that it would have been well worth his while to address it in some greater depth.<br /><br />Such quibbles are picayune though when set against the book he did write, which manages to be both informative and funny.

Comes Robert Howse to tread what seems to be some of the same ground -- including a protagonist who bears more than a passing resemblance to Mr. Bellow -- but, notwithstanding the author's obligatory disclaimer that all is fiction, I'm not sure how much of this we're supposed to connect to reality and how much is supposed to stand on its own. Matters are hardly helped by the fact that Mr. Rowse was a student of both Leo Strauss and Allan Bloom. The book is diverting enough in its own right, but leaves a gnawing feeling that in-jokes are slipping by we unwashed.<br /><br />The story takes Arthur Rizler, a Toronto-born novelist who enjoyed considerable success at mid-century, to post-communist Prague, where he is to deliver a lecture on Mozart. Accompanying him is his fourth wife, Maya, who is half his age and far more invested in the remains of his renown than he seems to be. Hot on their heels are Midge Svobodnik, Maya's mother who is bent on her daughter ditching Rizler so she can get on with having children, and Jeremy Stuart -- \\"a freelance agent of global capitalism and democracy, a citizen of the world, and much in demand as a speechwriter, an adviser, a behind-the-scenes-man, transnational troubleshooter\\" -- who is romantically obsessed with Maya. As the setting and the description of Jeremy suggest, one of Mr. Howse's main topics here is the triumphalist moment at the end of the Cold War when neoconservatism was in its first blush of glory and there was an easy buck to be made off of both explaining and implementing its ideas. He casts a somewhat dubious eye on the phenomenon of globalization and the notion of the End of History, referring wittily to CNN as \\"Fukuyama Vision\\" and saying of Maya:<br /><br />  Whatever wavering in her feelings about Rizler as a husband, she had never doubted for a moment that he was one of the few living human figures who had any capacity to make the human condition more tolerable, to combat the forces of darkness. Rizler was still, and would always be her world historical mission.<br /><br />That's a nice dig at the notion of the intellectual as Hegelian superhero, never mind the hero's latest trophy.<br /><br />Mr. Howse calls his book a farce, though it seems all too probable, especially when it ends with an event that has a distinct parallel in reality. Whatever the reader ends up classing it in, the book is dryly funny and an enjoyable read.eelings about Rizler as a husband, she had never doubted for a moment that he was one of the few living human figures who had any capacity to make the human condition more tolerable, to combat the forces of darkness.

It takes its place proudly on the continuum of American classics of youth between Huckleberry Finn, with which it shares the dynamic of a friendship between a white boy and a black man, and the magic-tinged books of Ray Bradbury--Dandelion Wine and Something Wicked This Way Comes--Robert McCammon-- Boy's Life--and Dan Simmons--Summer of Night. Thirteen-year-old Jim Black lost his alcoholic father in an accident but finds an unlikely--given the times--father figure in Samuel Joseph Washington, a former Negro League player who lives by the Little Wichita River where they both like to fish. Sam--whose beloved wife, Rose, is a devout Christian-- teaches Jim his own theory of life:<br /><br />  \\"You see, it has just always felt to me like we're all floatin' in a big river...and the current's carryin' us along...some parts flowin' slow and easy--that's when times are good; and some parts are pretty rough--bad times for sure.<br /><br />  \\"The way I see it, we're all sort of born into it, and after that, we're on our own. What I haven't figured out is why some folks seem to spend most of their lives in the rough water. I been there, that's for sure. And I reckon there are times when the current's just too strong to escape. But sometimes, I think you can swim out of it, if you want to bad enough and try hard enough. Sometimes. And I believe we're put here for a reason. And we're supposed to find that reason somewhere along the way \\"<br /><br />Helping Jim to navigate the river that season are his fast friends Gary Wayne Beesinger and Charles Luig. Together they get into all kinds of often very funny mischief, enjoy adventures, suffer misadventures and learn lessons about coping with tragedy, unrequited love, racism, and the various vagaries of life.<br /><br />Mr. Black treads lightly on the racial angle, which is a relief, since we might otherwise just end up with another sermon on the evils of the American South. Likewise, he give us hints that the magic and monsters of our youthful imaginations lurk in the background of the tale, but he doesn't yield to the temptation to veer into Stephen King territory. These two sensible decisions to make a final scene work far better than it might have otherwise, as Jim experiences what can only be called a miracle, and we buy into it completely. This is a delightful book that deserves a wide readership and will surely make a terrific film one day.end up with another sermon on the evils of the American South.

Everyone I know who's read Steven Pressfield's Gates of Fire considers it one of the best historical novels of all time--and, because it's the kind of book you force upon friends, that's just about every guy I know. When an author gives readers such a gift it seems only fair to give him some loyalty in return. So, although his newest seemed marred by a significant flaw, I kept reading Virtues of War, and that devotion was richly rewarded as in the end the seeming flaw turns out to be the point of the work and illustrates it beautifully.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's better publicized new film, Alexander, has re-ignited an ago old controversy about the conqueror: did his conquests serve a purpose, spreading Greek Civilization eastwards, or was it simply a matter of conquest for conquest's sake. As Peter Green explained in a recent review essay in The New Republic:<br /><br />  \\"Guy Griffith, my old ancient history teacher at Cambridge, is on record as holding it to be \\"one of the paradoxes of history (and historiography)\\" that despite Alexander's extraordinary career, which attracted so many writers, and despite the care that he devoted to the promotion of his own image, he \\"should have been handed down finally in history as an enigma.\\" In the half-century or so since then, historians have cleared up the picture a good deal, and Cartledge's well-documented account reflects this progress: the profile that emerges is that of a military genius driven by an overwhelming obsession, a pothos, to pursue glory through conquest to the world's end, and take savage reprisals against any who thwarted his will while he was at it. Arrian was surely right: had Alexander lived, \\"he would not have stopped conquering even if he'd added Europe to Asia and the Britannic islands to Europe.\\" It is almost impossible to think of Alexander in old age. He remains a beacon, an icon, arrested in mid-career, a meteor streaking for all eternity toward an infinite future. The Greeks who cursed him as a barbarous killer in his lifetime, but over the millennia came to see him as the brightest torch-bearer of the Hellenic spirit, are proof enough of that.\\"<br /><br />There's obviously much a writer of fiction can do with such paradox. The easy way out, for a popular novelist in particular, would be to make Alexander a pleasing action hero and \\"torch-bearer\\" of culture. Mr. Pressfield though, to his great credit, takes the far harder route, giving us an Alexander who is a creature of his own selfish ambitions. This Alexander is an anti-hero, which presents challenges to the reader, because we are so disaffected from Alexander's long march of war, and for the author; but, for the reader who sticks with him, Mr. Pressfield offers real rewards.<br /><br />The conceit of the novel is that Alexander has a demon, a \\"daimon\\" in Mr. Pressfield's parlance, which drives him onwards from brutal victory to brutal victory, a virtual being outside himself, preventing him from listening to his better angels. At first, when things are going well and fairly easily, with his army and his officers well-satisfied, the daimon is a relatively subdued presence. But as Alexander's appetite for new territory becomes insatiable and takes them farther and farther afield, until their wars can have only the most tangential relationship to security and interests of their Greek homelands, the army becomes increasingly restive, the commanders disgruntled, and Alexander less capable of holding back the daimon, which takes on the qualities of almost an alternate personality.<br /><br />I'll try not to give up too much of the endgame, but, in a pivotal scene late in the novel, Alexander is introduced to a gymnosophist, \\"the 'naked wise men' of India\\":<br /><br />  \\"This man has conquered the world! What have you done?\\" The philosopher replied without an instant's hesitation, \\"I have conquered the need to conquer the world.\\"<br /><br />The indictment that Mr. Pressfield hands down is that the unknownIndian's feat is a greater conquest than any of Alexander's.that the unknown Indian's feat is a greater conquest than any of Alexander's.	2005-02-19
344076:US	52173832	ROQH0F0R4HRI6	B0007DKV04	685952527	The golden warrior,: The story of Harold and William	Books	5	8	8	N	N	HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL	There are a lot of dates that every well educated person knows and, at some point, we actually learned what happened and why they were important:  1492--Columbus sailed the ocean blue; 1620--Pilgrims land at Plymouth Rock; 1776--Declaration of Independence; 1929-Great Crash.  There are also plenty of historic events that you think you know something about, but what you know is totally wrong (see my essay on David vs. Goliath).  But then there are those dates and names and phrases that you pick up as you go along without ever even having a mild clue what they mean or exactly what they reference.  Here's one: 1066.  Yeah, I know.  You recognize the year.  You may even remember that it was the year of the Norman Invasion.  If you got that far, you might remember that William the Conqueror won the Battle of Hastings and took over Britain.  But I was a History major and I sure as heck couldn't tell you any of the details.  Actually, I couldn't even remember who his opponent was and I sure couldn't remember why he had a claim to the throne.<br /><br />So I was enormously intrigued when, several years ago now, I saw a reference to The Golden Warrior by Hope Muntz as, \\"the greatest historical novel ever written\\".  As is the way with such things. I promptly saw two or three other mentions of this book which I had previously never heard of before.  I looked it up on Amazon and couldn't find it.  I even tried Amazon UK, but no luck.  Then one day at a local booksale, I found a copy.  It still has most of the dust jacket intact and the cover blurbs are by the great British historian G.M. Trevelyan and the novelist Vita Sackville-West.  I don't know if Muntz knew him personally, I actually haven't been able to find any information about her, but her dedication is to Winston Churchill.  All the bells and whistles are here; it seems like it must have been a significant book when it was published.  I have no idea why it is out of print. (The link above will take you to a book dealer website where you can find copies ranging in price from a few dollars to $15 or $20.)  Now, after reading it, I am even more mystified.<br /><br />First of all, the true historical material that Muntz had to work with is really interesting.  As the story opens, King Edward the Confessor sits upon the throne of England.  William (...), of Normandy, has just helped him drive off Godwin and his sons.  Godwin, a descendant of King Canute, is one of the most powerful noblemen in the land.  His daughter Edith is Edward's Queen.  Eventually, Godwin and his sons return and though Godwin dies, his son Harold appears likely to become king, as Edith has chosen to lead a cloistered life rather than produce an heir.  Meanwhile, William lusts for the throne himself and rests his claim to it on a promise that Edward made years earlier.  So it is Harold's great misfortune when he is shipwrecked on the coast of France and William secures possession of him.  The two get along famously, but William will not release Harold until he promises to support William's claim to the throne upon Edward's death.  Harold swears this oath and leaves his own brother as hostage.  This infuriates his other brothers, upon his return to England, and is one of the precipitating factors in his eventual falling out with his hot headed brother Tosti.<br /><br />When Edward dies (January 5, 1066), Harold, who is the most popular man in the kingdom, renounces his oath as having been secured under duress and he takes the throne.  The Pope rules in William's favor and the Normans mount an invasion with Rome's blessing.  Tosti, with the help of the Norwegian King Harald Sigurdson, attacks from the north and takes York.  But Harold defeats them at the battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25th.  He then has to wheel south, with a badly damaged army, and march to meet William.  On October 14, 1066, William deafeats him in the Battle of Hastings and becomes King of England.<br /><br />The author does this storyproud.  She wields a light hand in judging the motives and actions of the characters.  Both Harold and William come across as great men.  If we root for Harold, it is because he seems the better person and true patriot, even while he shares William's tremendous ambition.  Muntz tells the story in episodes.  Each chapter is headed Of... (Of Harold and Tosti, Of the Fight at Stamford Bridge, etc.), which, combined with judicious use of archaic language, conveys the feeling that one is reading one of the ancient sagas.  She manages to retain the sense that this is fundamentally a tale that is close to a thousand years old, yet keep the telling modern enough to appeal to the contemporary reader.<br /><br />This is a really fine novel (though probably not the best historical novel ever written) and will amply reward the effort necessary to seek it out.in judging the motives and actions of the characters.

638543:US	52173832	R1WJ8NAEOPDMMA	0974144304	784510850	The Holy Land	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Orwell for the Middle East	What George Orwell did for (or to?) the Russian Revolution in Animal Farm Robert Zubrin does to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict in this very clever satire. When the Western Galactic Empire relocates the unpopular race of Minervans to their original homeland in Kennewick, WA, the Americans take it poorly. The corrupt Christian fundamentalist administration in Washington, DC first tries to expel them using force, but when that fails they decide to make a play for galactic sympathy, so people are herded into &quot;refugee&quot; camps around the new Minervan land, to live in ostentatious misery. From these camps they launch suicidal terrorist assaults on the Minervans. Later, when the vital energy source helicity is discovered in America, the administration uses its wealth to set up training camps in far flung locales in order to have plausible deniability when it launches a spectacular 9-11-style attack on the Western Galactic Empire itself.<br />All of the elements of the conflict in our own Holy Lands are present here and there's great pleasure to be had in seeing how Mr. Zubrin draws the parallels. Likewise, the absurdity of these tactics is even clearer in a fictional setting than it is in real life. The Americans have no chance against the Minervans, who are decent folk and just want to live peacefully in the land that is rightfully theirs. The American political leaders cynically manipulate their own people and the galactic press and they engage in truly criminal behavior. But, something seemingly unintended does happen--even with the deck so stacked--this reader, at least, found his sympathies ultimately did lie with the Americans as against the Minervans. Sure, one would wish the leadership less corrupt and their means less vile, but tribalism/nativism is a powerful force and, in the end, it seems only natural to prefer Christian Americans who are rather similar to us, even if flawed, to the quite different Minervans. And, realistically, imagine that the Native Americans, who have a not un-Minervan claim to American soil, set up a state for themselves--how do you think we'd all react, no matter the abstract justice of their case?<br />As I say, I'd assume this reaction is not what Mr. Zubrin intended, but in a way it makes the book even more powerful. Once you recognize that you can abhor your own leaders methods but still find their cause somewhat compelling, you gain a genuine insight into the insanity that has infected the Palestinians. This insight can in no way justify terrorism but does suggest why more moderate and ordinary people are reluctant to disavow the extremists in their midst.e Americans, who have a not un-Minervan claim to American soil, set up a state for themselves--how do you think we'd all react, no matter the abstract justice of their case?<br />As I say, I'd assume this reaction is not what Mr. Zubrin intended, but in a way it makes the book even more powerful.

638744:US	52173832	R3OVKSPZNMTHCH	159071024X	547208814	The Gilded Chamber: A Novel of Queen Esther	Books	5	17	21	N	N	Making the ancient fresh	First a disclaimer: Ms Kohn is a neighbor and a friend--so some partiality is likely unavoidable in this review. That said, it was a considerable relief to open the pages of the book and find that no partisanship would be required to sing its praises. I read the first hundred pages in one gulp and was captivated. The story of Esther is one we know so well that we may cease to consider what it really means. Its characters are become so iconic we may forget they were human beings. Ms Kohn makes the story fresh and exciting, not least by expanding upon the character of Esther so that her actions are those of an engaging woman whose motivations we understand and whose courage we respect. Granting us a new look at the old tale, Ms Kohn makes us consider its lessons anew and they are as timely today as they were thousands of years ago.<br />The Biblical account of Esther is intact here, but Ms Kohn does take some liberties around it. For one thing, she has the young Jewish girl Haddasah initially betrothed to Mordechai, before being sent to the harem of King Xerxes. Mordechai himself has taken on the coloration of the court and of the worshippers of Ahura Mazda and urges the young Haddasah to: &quot;Let yourself be known only as Esther, foster daughter of Marduka the Babylonian.&quot; Then the great bulk of the action occurs in the harem. The novel focuses on how Esther learns to wield political power within that closed world, which will serve her in good stead when she later needs to affect the wide world. She develops believable relationships with the other women, servants and eunuchs of the harem and Ms Kohn is particularly good at portraying the internal conflict that being Jewish and loving Mordechai causes Esther as she is forced to disguise her true religion and serve a king she does not love:<br />I could eat the food of the harem. I could submit myself to the authority of a eunuch. I could go in to the king as a virgin and return to the harem as a harlot. I could live a life like [her servant] Puah's, with little joy over the generations.<br />But I could not worship the gods that were an abomination to my father. I could not betray Avihail, whose living seed remained in none other than me. I could not crush the memory of his righteous ways.<br />I had hoped to fulfill my days in Mordechai's household and to give him strong sons. Mordechai was a stranger to his people's ways, but my father would have lived on through the generations of our children's children. For Mordechai was still a Jew in his heart. He would walk among the idolaters, but he would not worship a stranger's gods.<br />And I could not do so now.<br />This doubleness is, of course, the key to the story, indeed to much of Jewish history. The struggle of a stateless Jewish people to conform sufficiently on the outside to fit into hostile societies but to maintain their faith and their traditions internally has played out for thousands of years, often with tragic results. As we look back at the story of Mordechai and Esther through the tragic lens of the Holocaust we can see how dangerous the tale is with its suggestion that if only the Jewish people are sufficiently righteous before G-d and pleasing in the eyes of their temporal rulers they will be spared, or at least empowered to protect themselves. Here are the most fateful Bible verses:<br />[E]sther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mor'decai;<br />All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.<br />And they told to Mor'decai Esther's words.<br />Then Mor'decai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than allthe Jews.<br />For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?<br />It's almost unbearably harsh to contemplate, but perhaps the lesson of the Holocaust is that the charge Mordechai places upon Esther applies to every Jew, to speak and act against injustice directed at their people lest they fall prey to it themselves.<br />At any rate, if the fictionalized portions of the book flesh out the characters it is when the biblical events return that the novel achieves great drama. The contest between Haman and Mordechai, with Esther ultimately determining the outcome, is thrilling even in the Bible's bare bones version, but all the more so once Ms Kohn has personalized it for us. At a time when every women's book club in America is fretting about its next choice and the box office and best-seller charts are topped by religion-themed works, the novel should find a wide audience and it richly deserves one.the Jews.<br />For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?<BR>It's almost unbearably harsh to contemplate, but perhaps the lesson of the Holocaust is that the charge Mordechai places upon Esther applies to every Jew, to speak and act against injustice directed at their people lest they fall prey to it themselves.<br />At any rate, if the fictionalized portions of the book flesh out the characters it is when the biblical events return that the novel achieves great drama.

Young Valeria is the daughter of a senator, as dowry she's brought this command to Marcus Flavius, who badly needs some military experience to advance his career. But plumping down the beautiful Valeria and the Marcus in the wilds of Rome's frontier provokes jealousy and passions that lead to war. In particular, the brutal and ambitious soldier Galba Brassidias and the Celtic chief Arden Caratacus are both drawn to Valeria and despise her husband.<br />If some of the characterizations seem kind of idiosyncratic and ahistorical--their actions, emotions, and openness are awfully modern--there's nonetheless ample enough action and romance to speed us past any tendency to overanalyze it as a work of history. There's also a fascinating tripartite culture clash, with the conflict between the somewhat rigid social conventions of Rome and the wilder, freer life of the Celts and then percolating beneath both the burgeoning influence of the new religion, Christianity, which will plow them both under eventually. It's all framed by the device of an investigation into events that have already transpired, which allows for some discursive passages on the background of the tale but does fracture the narrative at times. You may find yourself wondering why Mr. Dietrich doesn't just get back to the main story.<br />As historical romances go it's not up to the standards of a Sharon Kay Penman, but it's an ideal beach book, one that you can hand to the spouse when you're done with reasonable confidence they'll enjoy it.	2004-06-07

For all those fans we highly recommend this new book by Harvey Frommer, a long-time chronicler of the Yankees, and his son, Frederic.<br />They've combined a history of the two teams and their many contests with personal reminiscences--their own and those of players, other fans, and the rich and famous--and a host of terrific photographs to create a kind of scrapbook of the rivalry that some refer to as the American version of Athens (Boston) vs. Sparta (New York). In a book awash with great anecdotes it's hard to pick just one, but here's a Don Zimmer quote from the period when the tension between the two great catchers, Carlton Fisk and Thurman Munson, was as fierce as that between the teams in general:<br />Fisk hated Munson, Munson hated Fisk, and everyone hated Bill Lee.<br />Such hatreds have never been more enjoyable than they are in these pages.	2004-06-07

So, it's easy to see why he'd have jumped at the chance to cover the desert warfare of the second Iraq War up close and personal.<br />Many will already be familiar with the dispatches he filed for the Washington Post during the conflict and he brings the immediacy of such reportage to this memoir of being embedded with the 101st Airborne, but that's both a strength and its weakness. It's a strength in so far as he provides us a gifted reporter's ground-eye-view of the challenges and confusions soldiers and commanders face in the midst of combat and in the build-up to and aftermath of war. But it's a weakness in that the intentional lack of perspective makes people--not least himself--seem silly and petulant at times. For instance, the most controversial story he contributed to while in theater was War Could Last Months, Officers Say (Thomas E. Ricks, March 27, 2003, Washington Post):<br />Despite the rapid advance of Army and Marine forces across Iraq over the past week, some senior U.S. military officers are now convinced that the war is likely to last months and will require considerably more combat power than is now on hand there and in Kuwait, senior defense officials said yesterday.<br />The combination of wretched weather, long and insecure supply lines, and an enemy that has refused to be supine in the face of American military might has led to a broad reassessment by some top generals of U.S. military expectations and timelines. Some of them see even the potential threat of a drawn-out fight that sucks in more and more U.S. forces. Both on the battlefield in Iraq and in Pentagon conference rooms, military commanders were talking yesterday about a longer, harder war than had been expected just a week ago, the officials said.<br />&quot;Tell me how this ends,&quot; one senior officer said yesterday.<br />Read with the knowledge that the regime fell 21 days after the start of the war this can't help but seem even more hysterical now than it did then. Moreover, it seems likely that the Post and its correspondents, including Mr. Atkinson, were being used by the uniformed military, which wanted more troops, in bureaucratic infighting against the Pentagon's political leadership--Secretaries Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and the like. In that case the story wasn't just absurd, as becomes obvious in retrospect, but an instance of the press allowing itself to be manipulated, willingly or not. At any rate, it's singularly unedifying and such despair is not uncommon in the book. One wonders how much easier the victory could have been but perhaps the answer is that for the men fighting them all wars just suck and every day is a quagmire. If so, that's a valuable enough lesson to learn, especially for those of us who get to sit home and send others out to fight, but it does suggest that we shouldn't take their complaints terribly seriously.<br />Somewhat allied to this problem of quagmirism is Mr. Atkinson's obvious opposition to the war. He has every right to disapprove of it, but he makes a couple of disturbing comments along the way. At one point he makes fun of two soldiers for arguing that it was not a war about oil. As events have shown, and as all but true partisans surely recognized at the time, they were right and he wrong. Another, even more galling, instance of his cynicism comes when the great journalist and fellow embed Michael Kelly is killed in an accident and Mr. Atkinson refers to it as &quot;senseless.&quot; Now, perhaps he just means the accidental nature of the tragedy is senseless, but the death of a reporter in the very act of reporting on a dangerous situation seems the very opposite of senseless. It is noble.<br />On the plus side, and the plus side is considerable, Mr. Atkinson centers the book around the compelling figure of Major General David Petraeus, who he also &gt;profiled extensively for the Post. The General exemplifies the intelligence, political sensitivity, hypercompetitiveness, and ambition of the modern officer corps. The portrayal of General Petraeus and of other senior officers in the 101st, like Lt. Gen. William Wallace, are excellent and give us much cause for pride in our armed forces. Also interesting are Mr. Atkinson's reports on events he was able to experience in real time--or at least their aftermaths--like the grenade and shooting attack by an American G.I who'd converted to Islam that took place just before the war kicked off while the 101st was stationed in Kuwait. And, as mentioned above, Mr. Atkinson's own confusion about the events going on around him--as well as that of the officers he was talking to--reminds us of the wisdom of Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace, that the belief that commanders are in control of events is an illusion. War is by its nature a chaotic enterprise where what you think you know at any given moment is more than likely wrong.<br />Of course the story ends before we know how things will turn out in Iraq. By the end of Mr. Atkinson's stay it had already become obvious that diehards and extremists were going to cause significant problems as they resisted American, allied, and Iraqi efforts to reform the nation. But the pessimism with which the book concludes will hopefully turn out to be just one more case of being lost in the fog of war. When Mr. Atkinson sits down to write a history of the second Iraq War a few years from now it will be interesting to see how the perspective afforded by temporal distance changes the judgments he made here, while he was in the thick of things.siderable, Mr. Atkinson centers the book around the compelling figure of Major General David Petraeus, who he also &gt;profiled extensively for the Post.

At that<br />  point, the entire training exercise would stop. This insanity has been repeated on every military base in the nation in one fashion or<br />  another.<br />  The US Defense Department oversees and controls 17 million acres of US land, down from 30 million acres after World War II. It has<br />  been losing the fight for space to train a modern military for years. When asked about the need for national security, a spokesman for the<br />  Bureau of Land Management (the same one that shut off water to the farmers of Klamath Valley) was quoted in the article as saying,<br />  \\"It is not in our purview to make a determination related to national security. Ours is to make sure the Endangered Species Act is<br />  complied with.\\"<br />  And, after reading that and what follows, it's hard not to agree with his conclusion:<br />  [T]he Greens have infiltrated our military establishment, just as they have done in our nation's schools, and throughout federal and state<br />  government agencies. In every case, they have instituted and supported programs that will continue to have serious consequences for our<br />  national security and sovereignty.<br />  It is time to identify and root out these enemies of our military. A good first step would be to rescind the DoD Office of Environmental<br />  Security. This would help to begin restoring our nation's ability to wage war effectively against its enemies at home and abroad.<br />  Next, this nation has to rid itself of the Endangered Species Act and, ultimately, the greatest enemy of our national security, the<br />  Environmental Protection Agency.<br />  Sure, Saddam's Fedayeen can't stop our troops from driving across the desert, but a bureaucrat and a freakin' turtle can?<br />  Thanks to the miracle of the Internet, the good auspices of web-based magazines like the excellent Enter Stage Right, and the fecundity of his own<br />  mind, you can find many of Mr. Caruba's writings on-line (see below).

John Maxim goes them one better and imagines that much of<br />  Westport, Connecticut is peopled by semi-retired agents, loosely led by Paul Bannerman, who have all gotten out of<br />  the game (almost) and are trying to settle down to stable marriages, child-rearing, running small shops, and an<br />  especially adept neighborhood watch program.<br />  In this entry in the successful series, Bannerman has to set his travel agency business to one side just long enough to<br />  deal with Artemus Bourne, a megalomaniacal villain (is there any other kind) who's threatening Westport with a<br />  bioterror attack because he wants help finding famed assassin Elizabeth Stride, the Black Angel, a former colleague of Bannerman, whose<br />  supposedly-dead ex-boyfriend, an East German named Martin Kessler, has interfered in his African diamond and arms smuggling business. The<br />  interference in this case takes the form of sending Bourne the heads of three evil minions. Bannerman's \\"Ghosts\\", so called because they've<br />  disappeared from the world of black-ops, are galvanized into reasonably exciting action amidst presumably tongue-in-cheek worries about their<br />  domestic situations. Mr. Maxim utilizes just enough realistic background setting--like the genuine threat of Marburg virus--to give the story<br />  weight, but a light enough touch to keep it amusing, rather than melodramatic.<br />  Fans will be gratified that he brings together characters from a host of his prior books, while newcomers will have no trouble catching up.

But<br />  they found Crouchback and his views perverse. In those days, the thought that the Second World War might<br />  have been an error which left the world worse than it found it was almost unthinkable.<br />  There had been frightful blunders such as Singapore, admitted the reader in the National Health spectacles.<br />  But to see it all as a mistake, you would have to be...well, either a fascist or a believer in something perfectly<br />  weird. For instance, a devout member of the old English Roman Catholic aristocracy. Down the narrow<br />  perspective of that particular telescope, through which the welfare of the Vatican mattered more than cutting<br />  Axis communications in the Balkans, things might well look different.<br />  They did to fictional Guy Crouchback.<br />  -The Crouchback tendency (Neal Ascherson, January 7, 2001, The Observer)<br />  Like many of Evelyn Waugh's books, this one--the first in the Sword of Honour trilogy--is at least semi-autobiographical. But, whereas other<br />  life experiences gave him the fodder to savagely satirize such things as adultery/divorce, journalism, Africa, and Hollywood, his treatment of his<br />  checkered military career, probably tempered by a natural patriotism, comes in more for gentle ribbing. So there are plenty of amusing characters<br />  and absurd situations, beginning with the nature of the enlistee, Guy Crouchback, himself:<br />  'We don't want cannon-fodder this time'--from the Services--'we learned our lesson in 1914 when we threw away the pick of the<br />  nation. That's what we've suffered from ever since.<br />  'But I'm not the pick of the nation,' said Guy. 'I'm natural fodder. I've no dependants. I've no special skill in anything. What's more I'm<br />  getting old. I'm ready for immediate consumption. You should take the 35s now and give the young men time to get sons.'<br />  'I'm afraid that's not the official view. I'll put you on our list and see you're notified as soon as anything turns up.'<br />  But Mr. Waugh's heart, understandably, doesn't seem to be invested in really letting loose on the British armed services. This combines with the<br />  subject of the story--the painfully slow build-up to war--to render a novel that's somewhat less spirited than many of his others.<br />  However, it does have one feature that more than redeems it and makes it not only one of his most invaluable works, but one of the most important<br />  novels of WWII: its ferocious criticism of the British decision to accept the Soviet Union as an ally, rather than treat her as an enemy just as<br />  dangerous as Nazi Germany. Guy's initial fervor for war comes as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact:<br />  Just seven days earlier he had opened his morning newspaper on the headlines announcing the Russian-German alliance. News that<br />  shook the politicians and young poets of a dozen capital cities brought deep peace to one English heart. [...] He lived too close to Fascism<br />  in Italy to share the opposing enthusiasms of his countrymen. He saw it neither as a calamity nor as a rebirth; as a rough improvisation<br />  merely. He disliked the men who were edging themselves into power around him, but English denunciations sounded fatuous and<br />  dishonest and for the past three years he had given up his English newspapers. The German Nazis he knew to be mad and bad. Their<br />  participation dishonoured the cause of Spain, but the troubles of Bohemia, the year before, left him quite indifferent. When Prague fell,<br />  he knew that war was inevitable. He expected his country to go to war in a panic, for the wrong reasons or for no reason at all, with the<br />  wrong allies, in pitiful weakness. But now, splendidly, everything had become clear. The enemy at last was plain in view, huge and<br />  hateful, all disguise cast off. It was the Modern Age in arms. Whatever the outcome there was a place for him in that battle.<br />  But he despairs when, Hitler having betrayed Stalin, the Soviets are thereupon blithely accepted as comrades:<br />  Russia invaded Poland. Guy found no sympathy among these old soldiers for his own hot indignation.<br />  'My dear fellow, we've quite enough on our hands as it is. We can't go to war with the whole world.'<br />  'Then why go to war at all? If all we want is prosperity, the hardest bargain Hitler made would be preferable to victory. If we are<br />  concerned with justice the Russians are as guilty as the Germans.'<br />  'Justice?' said the old soldiers. 'Justice?'<br />  'Besides,' said Box-Bender when Guy spoke to him of the matter which seemed in no one's mind but his, 'the country would never stand<br />  for it. The socialists have been crying blue murder against the Nazis for five years but they are still pacifists at heart. So far as they have<br />  any feeling of patriotism it's for Russia. You'd have a general strike and the whole country in collapse if you set up to be just.'<br />  'Then what are we fighting for?'<br />  'Oh we had to do that, you know. The socialists always thought we were pro-Hitler. God knows why. It was quite a job keeping neutral<br />  over Spain. [...] It was quite ticklish, I assure you. If we sat tight now there'd be chaos. What we have to do now is to limit and localize<br />  the war, not extend it.'<br />  And so the comic misadventures that Guy undergoes in preparing for war are no longer even in furtherance of an ideal one can be proud of, but are<br />  instead the minmum required of a patriot.

Night Shyamalan's film Signs comes when Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) are discussing the<br />  implications of what seems to be an alien visitation, signaled by a number of lights that have appeared over Mexico City:<br />  People --- break down into two groups. When they experience something lucky, group number one sees it as more than luck or a<br />  coincidence. They see it as a sign, evidence that there is Someone out there watching out for them. Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a<br />  happy turn of chance. Well sure there are people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way. For them, the<br />  situation isn't fifty/ fifty could be bad, could be good , but deep down they feel that whatever happens, they are on their own, and that fills them<br />  with fear.<br />  Yeah, there are those people, but there's a whole lot of people in group number one. When they see those fourteen lights they are looking at a<br />  miracle. And deep down they feel that whatever is going to happen, there will be Someone there to help them, and that fills them with hope.<br />  So what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles, or do you believe that people<br />  just get lucky? Or look at the question this way --- is it possible that there are no coincidences?<br />  Luci Shaw's poetry is based on the thrill of finding those signs in the everyday, of having faith that it is God who has placed them there and hope because of that.<br />  A few examples will serve to give the flavor of the batch and speak far more eloquently than can I:<br />  We know this to start with:<br />  If we understood everything we wouldn't<br />  be baffled. But mystery lives; somehow<br />  without witchcraft or chicanery<br />  we collect sounds and colors in a skyward<br />  dish, like fruit in a bowl, and channel them<br />  into verisimilitude--faces talking at us<br />  from the tube's glass eye. Hallways of fog<br />  enfold us in enigma. And then, the marvel of<br />  window glass--how can anything be<br />  hard enough to stop the hand and<br />  hold its smudge while letting through this<br />  soft light? The one wheat kernel that<br />  breeds a thousand--a miracle of<br />  loaves over and over again.<br />  The stars, invisible in the blind day<br />  revealed, thick as pollen, by the absence<br />  of light. A billion spiky grass blades that melt<br />  into a perfectly flat horizon.

Since then I see<br />  the miniature leaves and buds as tips of trees<br />  burgeoning underground, knotted roots like limbs<br />  pushing up to light through rock and humus.<br />  The pure cross-flowers at my feet redeem<br />  their long, dark burial in the ground, show how even<br />  a weight of stony soil cannot keep Easter at bay.<br />  Bubble<br />  I watch it being blown,swelling and rising<br />  from my grandson's red plastic ring, fresh-filled<br />  with eager air, tenuous as just-spilled<br />  dandelion silk, a fluid wobble, quite surprising<br />  me with its likeness to our cosmic bubble,<br />  all greens and blues, each continent and sea<br />  etched in bright enamel by God and gravity--<br />  a film's fine iridescence fixed. The trouble<br />  is: before the shivering, frail balloon has hovered<br />  long it bursts in a star of spray that pricks my skin<br />  with cool fireworks, so that, in vanishing, it winks<br />  at my comparison just as the simile is offered.<br />  But mind's a watercolor paper.

You can't help but observe your surroundings<br />  more closely and ponder existence more fiercely. And it's certainly possible that you'll choose to be the kind of person who views it all as lucky chance and insists we're alone and nothing means<br />  anything.

But I don't know that<br />  anything can have prepared even his fans for this book, which, though one must have some reservations about its form, is quite simply one of the best golf<br />  books ever written.<br />  To begin with, Mr. Frost has chosen his topic wisely. Harry Vardon (1870-1937) and Francis Ouimet (1893-1967)--both of whom came from working<br />  class families, had difficult relationships with their fathers, and learned to golf as boys at the local courses where they caddied, Ouimet in Massachusetts, Vardon some twenty-plus years earlier on<br />  the Isle of Jersey--are thoroughly compelling heroes. In 1913 their similar stories converged at The Country Club, in Brookline, MA--the very club at which Francis had caddied--in the United<br />  States Open. Harry Vardon was at that time probably the best golfer in the world and in previous visits to America had been instrumental in marketing the game here. But it was to be the young<br />  amateur Francis Ouimet's playoff victory over the professional Vardon and countryman Ted Ray that, or so Mr. Frost argues, gave birth to the modern golf era in America.<br />  The book starts with extended biographical sketches of the two men and the events that brought them to the tee for their face-off. Numerous other characters are on hand to lend color--two of<br />  whom stand out, and will be the star-making roles in the inevitable movie: the dashing young American professional Walter Hagen (golf's eventual answer to Babe Ruth) and Eddie Lowery,<br />  Ouimet's preternaturally self-assured ten year old caddie. Digressions inform us about changes in rules and equipment, the professionalization of the sport, and its popularization. But it is the<br />  tournament itself that forms the bulk of the book, particularly the final day, the Monday playoff, when the little known twenty year old, playing before large and enthusiastic hometown galleries, on a<br />  course across the street from his own house, had to fend off two of the world's best.<br />  Mr. Frost's prose gets a tad purplish at times, but personally I thought that gave it the feel, of old time sportswriting. Besides, the story is so improbable that the reality seems like a clich?, so why not<br />  write it like a sports movie? More troubling is that Mr. Frost has chosen to provide dialogue and to ascribe thoughts and feelings to the various players even though he has had to create some of it<br />  himself, without ever differentiating which is which. Although it serves his purposes as a storyteller well, fleshing out the characters and letting us see them interact &quot;naturally&quot; with one another, it<br />  actually becomes distracting because you can't help but wondering which thoughts and words come from people's memoirs and contemporaneous accounts of the event (which are apparently<br />  sufficiently extensive so that much of what's here is genuine) and which are purely made up. It also--though we've seen experiments of this kind in recent years, like Edmund Morris's<br />  Dutch--seems more than a little unfair to attribute imagined words and emotions to real people who don't have an opportunity to dispute or confirm them. It would, I think, have been preferable to<br />  simply call the book a novelization, in the tradition of Michael Sharaa's Pulitzer Prize-winning account of Gettysburg, The Killer Angels. At the very least, there should be footnotes to indicate where<br />  truth ends and fiction begins. From an author or publisher's point of view there may be reasons not to do these things--just in terms of the sales and marketing of novels vs. nonfiction and reader<br />  dislike of footnotes--but from a standpoint of intellectual rigor it's somewhat disconcerting.<br />  Once you get past these considerations--and take my word for it, the writing and the story are so exciting that you will get past any questions--you're in for an unbelievably thrilling tale. It's<br />  especially recommended for golf fans, who will find the tangential stuff about the clubs and balls they used just as interesting as the championship, but it should really appeal to everyone, in much the<br />  same way that Seabiscuit reached past horse race fans to a wide audience.

I've been reading John McPhee since I was a kid and he was writing about Princeton and<br />  Knickerbocker hero Bill Bradley. In those nearly forty years I can't recall a single uninteresting piece he's written and many of them are marvelous. But<br />  when this book came over the transom was my reaction: great, a new John McPhee!? No. To my shame, it was: oh geez, 350 more routinely excellent pages<br />  from McPhee. Are there so many good authors out there that one can afford to be blas&eacute; about one of the best? Would I rather a book that might quite possibly<br />  stink, written by someone else, just for the uncertainty involved in reading it? How callow.<br />  In my own defense though, this time out Mr. McPhee is writing about the American shad. I'm as big a fan of fishing literature as anyone, but who does not<br />  feel, when they see a new fishing book nowadays, the way C.S. Lewis felt one night at a meeting of the Inklings, when J.R.R. Tolkien prepared to read to the<br />  assembled from his latest work: \\"Oh, no! Not another [freaking] elf!\\"? In your heart of hearts, don't you say to yourself: \\"Oh, no! Not another freaking fishing book!\\"?<br />  All the more reason to feel like a fool now, having read the book, when Mr. McPhee has demonstrated once again that he's one of the finest non-fiction writers in our history and that there's still plenty<br />  of life in the fishing genre. Mr. McPhee may not quite have invented the technique of taking a topic and looking at it in detail from top to bottom--the shelves are packed with books that have<br />  borrowed the technique, books with names like: Salt; Cod; Tobacco; and Coal--but he is the master. And so, in this book, we get the entire natural history of the fish and no one will finish the last page<br />  wishing he knew more about the shad. However, there are two segments that stand out and definitively lift the work out of the ordinary. It opens with that most hackneyed of scenes, an epic battle to<br />  land the big one, but in the author's capable hands it somehow seems new and fresh. It goes on for page after page, until the cops have even shown up--at his wife's request, to make sure he's not<br />  dead--until the climax can't possibly be worthy of the fight, but still he manages to make it satisfying.<br />  The other highlight surprises because it's so politically incorrect. The final chapter takes on not only PETA and other animal rights groups but well-intentioned fishermen everywhere to challenge the<br />  notion of catch and release. Honestly and guiltlessly discussing the inevitable damage that just landing a fish does to the animal, he leaves little doubt that however good releasing them may make<br />  fishermen and activists feel about themselves, it does little to help fish or fisheries.<br />  This ability to make the old seem fresh and to look at the seemingly sacred from a fresh perspective, make Mr. McPhee, even in his twenty-sixth book, a writer of currency and pertinence. I repent of<br />  my sin and I shan't ever doubt him again.of the fish and no one will finish the last page<BR>       wishing he knew more about the shad.

Honestly and guiltlessly discussing the inevitable damage that just landing a fish does to the animal, he leaves little doubt that however good releasing them may make<BR>       fishermen and activists feel about themselves, it does little to help fish or fisheries.<br />       This ability to make the old seem fresh and to look at the seemingly sacred from a fresh perspective, make Mr. McPhee, even in his twenty-sixth book, a writer of currency and pertinence. I repent of<BR>       my sin and I shan't ever doubt him again.	2003-03-01

Dunne had been writing these essays for nearly a decade when the<br />  Spanish-American War came and his (and Mr. Dooley's) criticism of it, as an imperialist enterprise, won him a national readership, plaudits from<br />  intellectuals, and friendship with folks like Mark Twain and, improbably, with arch-imperialist Teddy Roosevelt.<br />  The essays rely heavily on wringing humor from dialect, something that got laughs more reliably in that era of minstrel shows and the like. What's most<br />  interesting today about their politics is that they're of a piece with Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Orwell's Shooting an Elephant, in that they're<br />  anti-imperialist because of the effect it will have on the colonizers, rather than the colonized. Here's a representative sample:<br />  **Wan iv the worst things about this here war is th' way it's makin' puzzles f'r our poor, tired heads.

1210890:US	52173832	R1NV96LHG61KPW	0140291806	350820989	Home Truths	Books	4	6	7	N	N	minor, but worthwhile	David Lodge is justly revered as both one of the best comic novelists of recent decades and as a writer who explores serious moral themes through his satire.<br />  Folks then were somewhat disappointed when this novella was published, because it's not quite up to the standards of his novels. Perhaps they're being a tad<br />  fanatical.<br />  As Mr. Lodge acknowledges up front, Home Truths began life as a play and for purposes of this novelization he did not make major alterations. This leaves it<br />  with all the unnaturalness of theater--a single setting, just four characters, and a reliance on dialogue--despite the new format. You can either accept the<br />  limitations this imposes and be grateful for a chance to read an awkward but worthwhile piece that wasn't coming to a theater near you anytime soon, or you<br />  can dwell on the matter and not enjoy the book.<br />  Adrian Ludlow is a somewhat accomplished but now mostly silent author who's \\"retired\\" to an isolated English cottage with his wife, Eleanor. Over<br />  breakfast one morning they agonize over, and thrill to, a newspaper interview their old friend, screenwriter Sam Sharp, gave to an up and coming journalist, Fanny Tarrant, who's made her reputation<br />  by eviscerating the self-absorbed celebrity subjects of her profiles. A representative sample from the story on Sam reads:<br />  The first thing you notice about Samuel Sharp's study is that it's plastered with trophies, certificates and citations for prizes and awards, and framed press photographs of Samuel Sharp,<br />  like the interior of an Italian restaurant. The second thing you notice is the full-length mirror on one wall. \\"It's to give the room a feeling of space,\\" the writer explained, but you can't help<br />  thinking there's another reason. His eyes keep sliding sideways, drawn irresistibly by this mirror even while he's speaking to you. I went to see Samuel Sharp wondering why he had<br />  been so unlucky in matrimony. I left thinking I knew the answer: the man's insufferable vanity.<br />  It gets worse. But the truth is even these old friends are enjoying seeing him get his comeuppance, because he is just as vain as he's made out to be in the article.<br />  However, Sam soon arrives at the cottage and enlists Adrian's help in a scheme to get back at Ms Tarrant. Adrian will submit to an interview too, but even as he's being profiled he'll secretly profile<br />  her and sell the resulting hatchet job to a rival paper. The middle portion of the book--Act II, if you will--consists of the counter interviews. Ms Tarrant turns out to be not only quite attractive and a<br />  decent enough sort but also an unabashed fan of Adrian's best known novel. Adrian remains guarded as he digs into her life and eventually convinces her to try his sauna. Eleanor, who'd not wished to<br />  be a party to the charade, arrives home at a guilty-looking moment and, when Adrian is out of the room, simply unloads on him to the eager journalist. In particular, she's devastating in regards to the<br />  difficulty that his inability to duplicate the success of that early novel had on their home lives. She tells a number of painful pent up truths, but tells them to someone who may now share them with the<br />  whole world.<br />  In the final act, Sam and Eleanor and Adrian,, who's stopped speaking to his wife entirely, anxiously await the arrival of the paper that will have the dreaded profile. But as they wait Ms Tarrant shows<br />  up unexpectedly. Unbeknownst to the cottagers it's just been announced that Diana was killed in a car accident while trying to escape the paparazzi, so no one's likely to read or remember a profile of<br />  forgotten novelist Adrian Ludlow. Unfortunately though, Ms Tarrant just happens to have a second piece in that morning's paper, one that's particularly harsh towards the suddenly martyred Princess.<br />  Mr. Lodge brings forward a series of interesting points here. There'sthe strange nature of our celebrity culture, which sees oceans of ink and film devoted to people who are rarely worth knowing<br />  about and who, more often than not, have done nothing of real value. As Fanny Tarrant says:<br />  I perform a valuable cultural function. [...]<br />  There's such a lot of hype nowadays, people confuse success with real achievement. I remind them of the difference.<br />  But there's also a strange symbiosis between the celebrity and the journalist such that there's truly no such thing as bad publicity and the supposed exposer of the ugly truths about the rich and famous<br />  ends up being just another celebrant. And what surprises all of them, people who should be wise to the rules of the game if anyone should, is how much they are affected by news of Di's death:<br />  As the sound of the TV news coverage became audible, Adrian sat down on the chaise lounge to watch with the other two [Eleanor and Sam]. \\"I don't know,\\" he said. \\"A death can<br />  make a difference. Even the death of someone you never knew, if it's sufficiently...\\"<br />  \\"Poetic?\\" said Sam.<br />  \\"Yes, actually,\\" said Adrian. \\"Arousing pity and fear, whereby to provide an outlet for such emotions.\\"<br />  \\"Good old Aristotle!\\" said Sam. \\"What would we do without him?\\"<br />  \\"We pity the victim and fear for ourselves. It can have a powerful effect,\\" said Adrian.<br />  \\"Be quiet, for heaven's sake,\\" said Eleanor, who was sitting between them. \\"I can't hear what they're saying.\\" A representative of some relief agency was discussing the Princess's<br />  work for victims of landmines with the anchorman.<br />  \\"You think we're in for a national catharsis, then?\\" Sam said to Adrian, leaning back and speaking behind Eleanor's back.<br />  \\"Conceivably,\\" said Adrian.<br />  And when the papers finally come, with a story about their own lives, they stay glued to the TV instead.<br />  A full novel would have given Mr. Lodge an opportunity to spin out his own ideas about the strange vicarious lives we lead--where a modern nation can become obsessed by the murder trial of a<br />  former football star or by the death of an oft scorned royal--but he at least presents some questions for us to ponder. And, like all his work, it's very amusing. If you approach the book with a<br />  willingness to accept it for what it is, you'll certainly enjoy it.s the suddenly martyred Princess.<br />       Mr. Lodge brings forward a series of interesting points here.

As the authors say: &quot;A knowledge of each splay is essential to fully describe and understand the variations in ornithological dejecta.&quot;  It's largely by taking the subject exactly<br />that faux seriously, but then subverting it with the choice of topic and some very funny invented vocabulary, that they elicit laughs.

But regardless of Mr. Haldeman's intent, it reads today as one of the most conservative books in the history of science fiction.<br />The plot is pretty simple, in Earth's near future, an army of super-soldiers is drafted by the U.N. to go and fight the Taurans, a mysterious alien species which has apparently been attacking human space ships that have just made collapsar jumps (at .999 the speed of light) and arrived near Aldebaran.  The narrator is William Mandella who will fight the Taurans for a millennium, because of the disparity in how much time passes for him relative to Earth during his travels.  This means though that ever time he and his fellow soldiers return home, massive social changes have taken place.  So he returns to population explosions, euthanasia, and government controlled economies; then to a future where homosexuality and test tube babies have become the norm (and population stabilized at a billion people); and finally to a world where humankind has become nothing but a population of identical clones sharing a mind.  On this final return home, Mandella finds that the Forever War has all been a result of misunderstanding and a plot by militarist:<br />  The 1143-year-long war had begun on false pretenses and only continued because the two races were unable to communicate.<br />  Once they could talk, the first question was \\"Why did you start this thing?\\" and the answer was \\"Me?\\"<br />  The Taurans hadn't known war for millennia, and toward the beginning of the twenty-first century it looked as though mankind was ready<br />  to outgrow the institution as well.  But the old soldiers were still around, and many of them in positions of power.  They virtually ran<br />  the United Nations Exploratory and Colonization Group, that was taking advantage of the newly-discovered collapsar jump to explore<br />  interstellar space.<br />  Many of the early ships met with accidents and disappeared.  The ex-military men were suspicious.  They armed the colonizing vessels,<br />  and the first time they met a Tauran ship, they blasted it.<br />  They dusted off their medals and the rest was going to be history.<br />  You couldn't blame it all on the military, though.  The evidence they presented for the Taurans having been responsible for the earlier<br />  casualties was laughably thin.  The few people who pointed this out were ignored.<br />  The fact was, Earth's economy needed a war, and this one was ideal.  It was a nice hole to throw buckets of money into, but would unify<br />  humanity rather than dividing it.<br />This entirely risible concoction of Mr. Haldeman's appears to be about equal parts Dr. Strangelove and Report from Iron Mountain, just as his population worries reflect the most hysterical ravings of Paul Ehrlich and his celebration of drugs is leftover Timothy Leary.  In short, he fell prey to nearly every quackery of the 70s.  And if the Forever War is really supposed to be an allegory for the Vietnam War, the notion that Vietnam was about nothing surely went out of fashion with the boat people.  The judgments of history have been unkind to Mr. Haldeman's overt politics.<br />Oddly though, there's an unintentional covert politics at work here that succeeds brilliantly and remains trenchant and true.  For one thing, the book offers a convincing argument against gays in the military and is downright homophobic.  But as an overarching matter, it seems obvious that the world that Mandella and his fellow soldiers once knew is much preferable to the Earth they keep returning to, with its big government, declining morality,  cheapening of human life, and finally the disappearance of the individual.  The closing pages are as good an argument against bio-engineering/cloning as you'll find anywhere on the ChristianConservative Right today.<br />Unfortunately for Mr. Haldeman, while the future he predicted as a result of militarism turned out to be a delusion, the world that peace and plenty may bring turns out to resemble his nightmare.  When, at the end of the novel, Mandella and his woman reject the new Earth and settle instead on Middle Finger, they turn out to be flipping the bird to precisely the kind of placid but pointless, grotesquely egalitarian, utopia that the Left dreams of today.  The folks who were \\"stuck\\" in the military, with it's unchanging values, turn out to be the great hope of the species.  I must confess, I take great joy in this perverse reversal that events have wrought on Mr. Haldeman's book.<br />GRADE: A- (though accidentally)find anywhere on the Christian Conservative Right today. <br />Unfortunately for Mr. Haldeman, while the future he predicted as a result of militarism turned out to be a delusion, the world that peace and plenty may bring turns out to resemble his nightmare.

In fact, the first few pages had me a little worried because there's some rather pedestrian prose and one of the yachts in the race was owned and skippered by Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who seems early on like he's going to be the center of attention in the book.  This would be unfortunate because he's a difficult man to root for, at least as presented here, often in his own words.  Actually, most of the yachtsmen seem fairly unlikable.  It sometimes seems like every one of them thinks he's the only competent guy on board.  But any initial concerns disappear once the storm hits and as the action at sea picks up so too does Mr. Knecht's writing.<br />The Sydney to Hobart race is apparently quite a big deal in Australia; from the sound of it, nearly the whole nation stops to watch the start on Boxing Day (December 26th).  In 1998, 115 unsuspecting boats set out but only 43 made it to Hobart (Tasmania).  Seven boats were abandoned and another five actually sank.  55 men were rescued.  Six men died.  The race had run into hurricane conditions, a cyclone sporting 80 mile per hour winds, and the sleek, ultra-engineered boats seem to have been particularly unsuited to such weather.  In short order men were in the water and it is mostly them that Mr. Knecht follows and it is there that the book becomes genuinely thrilling, and terrifying.<br />The crew of the Winston Churchill, which was capsized by a 60 foot wall of water that broke over it, ended up in two life rafts.  The other crew whose ordeal Mr. Knecht chronicles had been aboard the Sword of Orion.  The hours, even days, these men spent in the water make for painful reading.  One of the indelible images from the book is that of survivors recalling the sight of the bobbing heads of crewmates just a hundred yards away and knowing there's no way to get to them.  The stories of these men and, as in The Perfect Storm, of the rescuers, make for a substantial portion of the book and it's outstanding.<br />A shorter concluding portion, featuring various courtroom hearings, unfortunately serves to remind us that, with some exceptions, these sailors just aren't a terribly sympathetic lot.  Mr. Knecht presumably chose to write about Larry Ellison because he's a well known figure and a major businessman (Mr. Knecht writes for the Wall Street Journal), but he becomes kind of emblematic of the hubris that plagues them all :<br />  I could have bought the New York Yankees, but I couldn't be the team's shortstop.  With the boat, I actually get to play on the team.<br />Note he's characterizing himself not just as any old player but as the shortstop.  Likewise, Lachlan Murdoch, son of Rupert, who sailed on Ellison's boat, Sayanora, has this to say :<br />  There are people who in their makeup need to take risks.  [...]  Every once in a while I just have to do things that require me to make<br />  judgments about how far I can go.<br />It takes a nearly superhuman effort on the part of the reader not to wish that it had been their boat that foundered.  In this regard the book has a significant structural weakness in common with The Perfect Storm in that we spend too much time with people we don't care about and not enough time with some of the most compelling people in the book, the rescue workers who risk their own lives to save such men.<br />On balance then, Mr. Knecht has written a book that's well worth reading and is truly gripping throughout the bulk of the action.  That less might have been better does not diminish the quality of what's best here and at its best the book is very good.<br />GRADE : B+very good. <br />GRADE : B+	2002-10-01
1391871:US	52173832	RV3EXHWVWSEI0	0684859785	92435896	The DREAMS OUR STUFF IS MADE OF: How Science Fiction Conquered the World	Books	4	24	26	N	N	tough love	Mr. Disch, a well regarded science fiction writer, poet, playwright, and critic, here gives us a critical history of the scifi genre that resembles nothing so much as a drive-by shooting.  When he's done, the field is lettered with the shattered reputations of the field's hacks (from John Norman to Newt Gingrich), quacks (from L. Ron Hubbard to Whitley Streiber), feminists (Ursula K. LeGuin & company), fascists (Robert Heinlein), technophiles (Greg Egan), proselytizers (Orson Scott Card), and so forth and so on.  Among the offenses cited, besides bad writing, are a tendency to pander to the ... fantasies of young men, a willingness to exploit things like UFO crazes and apocalyptic beliefs, extreme right-wing politics, extreme left-wing politics, dumbing down for the mass audience, jargoning up for the academic crowd, employing ludicrous science, jingoism, racism, ... speciesism, etc.  Hardly anyone comes off well--himself, H.G. Wells, Philip K. Dick, J.G. Ballard, Iain M. Banks, Joe Haldeman and a very few more, plus Edgar Allan Poe gets an ambivalent nod, given credit not only for inventing science fiction but for embodying it entire in his work, both its good and its bad aspects.<br />Mr. Disch is particularly drawn to Poe as perpetrator of  hoaxes, a talent he think central to science fiction.  In fact, he believes lying to be central to our national character:<br />  America is a nation of liars, and for that reason science fiction has a special claim to be our national literature,<br />  as the art form best adapted to telling the lies we like to hear and to pretend we believe.<br />In Mr. Disch's view, Poe and his successors mastered the art of telling people what they want to believe.  And in stories like Mesmeric Revelation and The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar, he finds Poe to have anticipated nearly every theme that would be developed by subsequent writers:<br />  1. Mesmerism<br />  2. Dreams come true<br />  3. Chip-on-the-shoulder superiority<br />  4. Genuine visionary power<br />  5. Great special effects<br />  6. Sophomoric humor<br />  7. Divine madness<br />Over the course of the book he shows how these themes have been employed for good and ill, by various writers, the overwhelming majority of whom he believes have exploited their readers dreams without living up to the admonition that forms the title of Delmore Schwartz's first collection of poems, In Dreams Begin Responsibilities, which Mr. Disch alludes to in the title of this book.  Too often he finds his subjects dodging responsibility in favor of popularity, easy money, fadishness, and personal political predilections.<br />Inevitably the folks who come off worst here are the fans who let authors get away with this stuff.  At best Mr. Disch portrays them as kind of reminiscent of the guys from your high school's A.V. club, with delusions of superpowered children, women who want to be dominated and alien races just waiting to be wiped out.  At worst, they're militiamen like those from the Oklahoma City bombing or the members of the Heaven's Gate or Aum Shinrikyo cults.  That is, they're totally gullible, susceptible to either homicidal or suicidal suggestion.  And always they're the oft-caricatured geeky losers who attend Star Trek conventions.<br />As you can tell by now, this is a very dark vision of science fiction--one of the rare bright spots (according to Mr. Disch anyway) coming when it helped us learn to live with the atom bomb. Equally bleak is his prediction for the future, when movies and television, now that their effects can match our imaginations, take over from books.  In the end what keeps us reading, even as he's telling us that most of what we're reading about is junk, is the quality of Mr. Disch's analysis and the sheer bravado with which he attacks his own peers, predecessors, and heirs.  There's something here to alienate just about every reader, but the very equal opportunity nature of the drubbings he administers makes it hardto stay mad.  If he's laying into an author you like or a political philosophy you admire, have no fear, on the next page he'll have moved on to authors and ideas you loathe.  One admires the high moral seriousness to which he summons science fiction, but despairs as he says it's not happened in the past and isn't going to happen in the future.  He kind of reminds you of the American colonel in Vietnam who opined: \\"We had to destroy the village to save it\\", except that Mr. Disch adds that the village is doomed anyway.  This may be too upsetting for scifi fanatics but for the casual fan or the merely curious reader it's an enjoyable performance to behold.<br />GRADE: B-gs he administers makes it hard to stay mad.

Creating an alter ego, Dr, Tatiana, who's a sex advice columnist to the animal world, Olivia Judson offers numerous fascinating examples of the myriad bizarre and entertaining ways in which bugs, fish, birds, and mammals (and a few other things) procreate.  The format of the book, with her answering nervous letters from various creatures, is derived from a column she wrote for The Economist in 1997 and it allows her to keep the discussion light and sometimes very funny...  The humorous style allows her to explore sexual strategies like adultery, rape, murder, cannibalism, asexualism, homosexuality, etc., without getting too bogged down in their broader implications.  That latter point though leads to what will be an equivocation.<br />It seems, particularly in light of the anthropomorphism that Ms Judson utilizes, like this survey of the sexual mores of other species is ultimately intended to inform our understanding of the various practices we humans engage in.  If not strictly suggested by the humanized manner in which she presents her case studies, it is certainly implicated in her conclusion:<br />  I hope that having seen the prodigious variety of sexual practices out there, you'll be more tolerant of the predilections of others.<br />This hope is hardly justified by what has come before.  Even if we grant for the nonce that Ms Judson has demonstrated that evolutionary pressures have created a wide range of reproductive strategies, a \\"predilection\\" is a mere preference for something. Assuming that evolution is sound science, animals respond to an overwhelming force of nature; they don't just pick and choose sexual behaviors because they seem like fun; only humans have this privilege.<br />Taken at face value, Ms Judson's point might invite us to broaden our minds to the point where Jeffrey Dahmer's cannibalism may be tolerated as just another in a wide range of entirely natural sexual practices.  Or rape could be accepted as just an evolutionary adaptation; indeed, evolutionary psychologists have proposed that this may be the case.  If Ms Judson is trying to suggest that any behavior we can find in another species deserves our tolerance, she really ought to have made a sustained argument, rather than, in effect, just saying that this stuff happens therefore it's natural, therefore it should be tolerated.  If she's not suggesting any such thing, then one wonders what the purpose of the book is.<br />If it's just a titillating entertainment that's fine, because it is very entertaining.  But if we are supposed to be able to draw any conclusions from the book, the simple fact that neither survival nor reproduction appear to offer much challenge for modern humans would seem to mitigate against the idea that aberrant behaviors are anything more than mere preferences.  Factor in the unique human soul and our free will and it seems fair to ask why the exercise of personal preferences should not be subject to moral judgment.<br />Ultimately, Ms Judson overreaches her material, but not before she's made reading the book worth our while.<br />GRADE: B-exual practices.

Nor, I suspect, have many of you. This is an injustice, one that Mr. Hadari's translations can hopefully help to right.<br />Hayim (or Chaim) Nahman Bialik is considered the national poet of Israel, even though he died before the state was founded. He is also considered one of the greatest Hebrew poets ever. In fact, one of his achievements was to restore Hebrew as the language of Jewish poetry, rather than the Yiddish that had become more common. Bialik was born in Radi, Russia, and was raised there and in Zhitomir, by a scholarly father and, upon his father's death, by a stern and scholarly grandfather. Upon reaching adulthood he lived off and on in Odessa which, unlike other Russian cities which forbade them, had a sizable population of Jews (including fellow writers like Isaac Babel, Ze'ev Jabotinsky, and Ahad Ha'am, a Zionist who was one of Bialik's mentors). Bialik worked in business, as a teacher, as an editor, and finally as a publisher. He traveled in Europe and to what was then Palestine. After the Communist Revolution in Russia, when he came under suspicion for his writings, Bialik moved first to Germany and then to Tel Aviv where he was buried after dying in Vienna following an operation in 1934. Over the course of his career he translated Jewish folk tales, wrote Zionist essays and wrote his own poems (though not many after 1916). It was these last that made his name. And it was one specific poem that made him a central figure in the history of Zionism.<br />Living in Czarist Russia, he witnessed at first hand the brutal treatment of the Jewish people. In particular, he visited the city of Kishinev (modern day Chisinau, Moldova) after the 1903 pogrom in which 50 Jews were murdered.Ê Fueled by anger both at what had been done and at the inadequacy of Jewish response, he wrote his greatest poem, the one with which Mr. Hadari begins the collection : City of the Killings (1903). I wish I could find the whole thing on-line because it's unbelievably powerful...<br />From his own comments in the Translator's Note and from Dan Miron's Introduction, it sounds like Mr. Hadari has focussed more on capturing the spirit and the rhythms of the poems, than trying to artificially preserve exact rhymes and wordings :<br /> \\"If a poem is mostly words--and fancy words at that--there's precious little there. What I look for is attack, as Derek Walcott would put it-- it's not enough to know what the word means, though that helps; one needs to also get a sense of the spin on the word--so that if I take liberties  with the translation, to take the necessary liberty of translation that results in the flight of the new poem, I must have a sense of the bias  of the material; as may be the case in the treatment by the novelist of historical material, or indeed the treatment by a historian of that same material--he uses historical material but it's the bias of his treatment that's interesting, just like the historian's choice of facts determining the portrait; so with the poem, if the feeling charging the words is absent, if the feeling in fact doesn't overwhelm the language, like a current  making the touch of the actual line dangerous, there's no poem to prepare--no song that can be rephrased in English; the translator is, finally  a harmonizer with the lead vocal; in the prime moments he is reproducing the singer, in the same key, with variations, in another language.  That is the problem, to find the same rhythms, near the same sense, and with the right emotional current. If there's no current, how can you possibly begin to raise your voice? Let alone if the words resist comprehension, and the rhythm stutters. \\"<br />Not knowing the originals, nor any Hebrew, I've no idea how successful he's been in this task, but I do know that Mr. Hadari's translations tap into a rich emotional current and get you toraise your voice. Whether or not it's precisely Bialik's spirit, they're certainly spirited. Mr. Hadari's done a great service by making the poetry of Bialik accessible to the wider audience the great poet deserves.to raise your voice.

The narrator, Casseia Majumdar had dreamed of an independent Mars since participating in a student rebellion in 2171.  Her quest led her into politics and eventually to a momentous decision when the final confrontation with Earth came.  Meanwhile, her one time lover, Charles Franklin, had an intuition that the universe is basically a matrix of information and that by tweaking the flow of data we might be able to alter reality.  It is his work that scares Earth enough to force it to act.  Together the two, quite literally, change the course of Mars.<br />Though the novel could use an aggressive trimming and the setting seems not to have much depth to it, what makes the book so compelling is that Mr. Bear in some ways really just replays the core dilemmas of Western Civilization in outer space, particularly the competing desires for freedom or security.  Earth has become a place where people utilize mind and body enhancements, where they eagerly embrace psychological therapies, and where the aversion to conflict and the impulse towards homogeneity is so great that people link their minds together and/or link up with computers (thinkers).  Mars is far more individualistic and natural and resistant to this dull sameness.  At one point, on a trip to Earth to negotiate a treaty, Casseia has the following &quot;discussion&quot; with a thinker named alice (after Alice in Wonderland) :<br />  &quot;Eventually, human groups and thinkers could be so integrated as to be indistinguishable.<br />  At that point, such a society exceeds my modeling ability,&quot; Alice concluded.<br />  &quot;Group mind,&quot; I said sardonically. &quot;I don't want to be there when that happens.&quot;<br />  &quot;It would be intriguing,&quot; Alice said. &quot;There would always remain the choice to simulate isolation as an individual.&quot;<br />  &quot;But then you'd be lonely,&quot; I said, with a sudden hitch in my voice.  Perversely, I yearned for some sort of connection with agreement and<br />  certainty--to truly belong to a larger truth, a greater, unified effort.  My Martian upbringing, my youth and personality, kept me isolated<br />  and in constant longing.  I deeply wished to belong to a just and higher cause, to have people--friends--who understood me.  To not be lonely.<br />  In a few clumsy, halting sentences, I expressed this to Alice as if she were a confidant and not an examiner.<br />  &quot;You understand the urge,&quot; Alice told me. [...]<br />  &quot;The wish to belong to something greater is an historical force, recognized, sometimes fought against, but regarded by many as inevitable.&quot;<br />  &quot;Scary.&quot;<br />It may be that the degree to which you enjoy the book is determined by just how scary you find the specter of such &quot;belonging&quot;.

1416476:US	52173832	R2VK9633S9T6I	0375505385	784510723	The Count and the Confession: A True Mystery	Books	5	15	15	N	N	terrific true story	Murder mysteries, both fiction and non-fiction, are generally driven by one of three questions, or by some combination thereof : (1) Who done it?; (2) How'd they do it?; and/or (3) Why'd they do it?  One of the things that makes John Taylor's The Count and the Confession so engaging is that the true-life crime at its core not only involves all three of these questions but, remarkably enough, a rarely asked fourth question : Was there even a murder?  There's certainly a body.  In 1992, Roger de la Burde--a thoroughgoing scoundrel, though he styled himself a Polish count--was found dead in his locked Powhatan County, Virginia house with a single gunshot wound to the head and the proverbial smoking gun in his hand.  To all appearances it was a case of suicide, but eventually his lover of thirteen years, Beverly Monroe, would be convicted of his murder, a verdict aided greatly by Ms Monroe's own confession that she was present when the gun fired.<br />Over the course of the book, as Mr. Taylor walks back the cat on this case, two elements emerge as the keys to what may well have been a miscarriage of justice.  First he explores the deplorable character of Roger de la Burde, who in addition to not actually being a count was also a serial womanizer--having left his wife for Ms Monroe and having impregnated another woman at the time of his death, among his many sexual exploits--and a dealer in bogus artworks.  He was also mired in a lawsuit with his former employer, Phillip Morris, which seems to have been a groundless attempt to extort money from them.  He was also extraordinarily manipulative.  One of the of the highlights of the book is his will, which is a model of self-absorption, judgmentalism, and how not to treat your daughters.  All of this makes him pretty entertaining to read about but it's surpassing hard to mind that he's dead, whether by his own hand or at that of another.<br />Meanwhile, Beverly Monroe captivates us because on the one hand she seems reasonably pulled together, well-educated, financially independent, seemingly a good mom.  But on the other, she tolerated de la Burde's shenanigans, including knowing that he was trying to have a \\"male heir\\" by just about any woman who was willing, and she made that confession.  And that's the second element that Mr. Taylor focuses on : why would beverly Monroe confess to being there when de la Burde died if she wasn't?<br />It is here that a sort of villain emerges, David Riley, chief investigator for the county.  Riley determined to his own satisfaction that the position in which de la Burde was lying and the way he was holding the gun indicated not suicide but murder and he settled upon Beverly Monroe as the culprit.  He then used a variety of techniques, from a lie detector test that he informed her she'd failed to commiserating about how badly de la Burde had treated her to threats about how the prosecution might portray her to an oft repeated, nearly hypnotic suggestion that, even if she didn't kill him, she must have been there when de la Burde died.  When she accepted this last scenario and made it her own, it enabled the state to portray her as a murderess once they used forensic evidence to rule out suicide.<br />As Mr. Taylor shows though, and as her lawyers were able to show on appeal, it seems unlikely that she was in the room at the time and there is significant reason to doubt the evidence that the state purported to show that de la Burde did not fire the shot that killed him.  In fact, Ms Monroe's appeal was eventually successful and she has been released from prison pending further appeal by the state.  However, even if we accept that she did not kill de la Burde--and the author, though he does not slip into advocacy does make it hard for us to believe anything other than that it was a suicide--in the end, we come back to the central mysteries : the count and the confession.<br />Towards the end of the book Mr. Taylor recounts a moment where Beverly Monroe's original attorney, Murray Janus, is reflecting on the reasons he lost at trial :<br />  After all these years, Janus still could not believe that Beverly had given those statements to Dave Riley.  They were tantamount to a confession.<br />  Why she did it was truly a mystery, second only to the mystery of how Roger de la Burde had died.<br />That this moment comes so late in the proceedings and that even then we join in Janus's wonderment at these two mysteries, suggests why Mr. Taylor's story works so well.  For by then we kind of know the answer to two of those classic murder mystery questions.  We know why someone would have killed de la Burde and we know how it might have been done (a jury bought it anyway).  But we still don't know who killed Roger de la Burde and we really have to doubt that anyone did.  It seems a simple case of suicide gone horribly wrong in the hands of an overzealous investigator.  And Beverly Monroe seems to have been, as she was so often and maddeningly during his life, a victim of de la Burde's misbehavior and her own malleability.  But if her continual acquiescence in that misbehavior makes her somewhat unsympathetic early on in the tale--just as it makes him wholly unsympathetic--then the grace with which she handles the conviction and the determination with which she and even more so her daughter, Katie, fight the appeal serve to redeem her.  Even if you're ambivalent about her at first, as I have to admit I was, you'll be rooting for Beverly Monroe by the end.<br />GRADE : A-Monroe's original attorney, Murray Janus, is reflecting on the reasons he lost at trial : <br />    After all these years, Janus still could not believe that Beverly had given those statements to Dave Riley.

As Clavell renders the tale, only the Catholics, thanks to the presence of their missionaries in South America have access and no the secrets of this marvelous remedy.<br />Well, comes now Mark Honigsbaum to reveal the remarkable true story behind cinchona bark, of its discovery, of the realization that the quinine that can be derived from the bark can cure malaria (though certain trees produce more quinine), of the attempts of the natives to maintain a monopoly on it, and of the colonial adventurers who set out to steal it from them.  The bulk of the book is taken up with exciting expeditions into the Andes in search of the bark, led by men like Richard Spruce, Charles Ledger, and Clements Markham.  But these stories eventually begin to run together and as they pile atop one another the feats performed no longer seem so remarkable.  The author also has something of an axe to grind, referring to the eventual illicit exportation of the cinchona trees to Java and India which broke the South American monopoly as one of history's greatest robberies.  this has the unfortunate effect of making the heroes of the book come across simultaneously as villains.  Moreover, it seems a debatable point whether the \\"robbery\\" was justified, since the original bark exporters proved unable to meet demand and since for those with malaria access to the medicine it produces can be a matter of life and death.<br />Even today malaria still kills as many from one and a half to three million people a year and Mr. Honigsbaum ends with a section on the current science and the ongoing search for a cure.  One of the more promising lines of research appears to involve a DNA vaccine, taking DNA from the mosquito-born parasite that causes malaria and injecting it into muscle in order to get the immune system to produce T cells that will attack the parasite when it appears in the body.  this is all interesting enough, but has the feel of having been tacked on to flesh out the book.<br />Ultimately this seems a case where less would have been better.  For instance, had Mr. Honigsbaum just told the story of one of the cinchona hunters.  Or perhaps he might have gone the historical novel route and combined some of the characters.  As it stands, while much of the background on malaria is fascinating and the various searches for cinchona are exciting, the narrative ends up being a bit too diffused.  One never really has a sense that the author had a necessary end point he was trying to reach, and so he seems to be meandering.  Some of the meanders prove worthwhile in their own rights, but the attention does begin to wander.

So some people imagine.<br />  This is not the way it is.<br />  Animals in the wild lead lives of compulsion and necessity within an unforgiving social hierarchy in an environment where the supply of fear<br />  is high and the supply of food low and where territory must constantly be defended and parasites forever endured.  What is the meaning of<br />  freedom in such a context?<br />  -Life of Pi<br />Whatever else it may be, and it may be a fable or a hallucination or something altogether beyond our ken, Canadian author Yann Martel's Life of Pi is an absolutely mesmerizing bit of storytelling, one that will keep you reading from cover to cover without a pause.  Within, he tells the story, framed by author's comments which suggest it is a true story, of an Indian boy, Piscine Molitor &quot;Pi&quot; Patel, named for a swimming pool in Paris, who spent a thoroughly improbable, though entirely compelling, 227 days (from July 2, 1977 to February 14th, 1978)  lost at sea in a lifeboat with a 450 pound Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker.<br />Boy and tiger were originally on board a Japanese freighter that was transporting them and the Patel family along with numerous other animals to Canada, to which the Patels were transplanting themselves and their zoo, from Pondicherry, India to escape political unrest.  A zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, some rats, and a few cockroaches survived the initial sinking, but not Richard Parker's predations.  Only Pi and the tiger eventually made it to Mexico, where they washed up on a beach before Richard Parker disappeared. During their time in the lifeboat, and on a makeshift raft that Pi made himself, to put some distance between himself and the big cat, transpired a remarkable story of survival and of natural selection in all its gory glory.<br />It is a story, as an old man in India told the author, &quot;that will make you believe in God&quot;.  Or, maybe it isn't.  Maybe it's the kind of story that will make you believe in the human need to tell stories in order to make sense of our existence, an animal story told by the most dangerous of all the animals, but nonetheless the one animal that tells story and that knows God.  Or maybe it's just a fairy tale.  At any rate, it's a terrifically readable and enjoyable novel (?) and Pi Patel, a Hindu/Muslim/Christian--who when he swears says &quot;Jesus, Mary, Mohammed and Vishnu!&quot; and who's felt the presence of God--seems certain to become one of the most fondly remembered narrator/heroes of modern fiction.<br />GRADE : Ahe tiger eventually made it to Mexico, where they washed up on a beach before Richard Parker disappeared.

Today we take for granted the notion that the military is subject to civilian control and that even great victors will yield to their elected commanders in Washington.  In this assumption we do a disservice to history and to the remarkable men who've served us, for there is nothing less common in the bloody epoch of warfare than for a conquering army and its leader to quietly return home without making any demands first.  Whether through luck, through the genius of the system, or through God's \\"special providence\\", America has been blessed with generals who have asked nothing for themselves despite winning stupendous victories.  Eisenhower not only joins the long list of American heroes in this regard--which includes Washington, Grant, and Pershing--he also, as Mr. D'Este does make clear, was willing time and again to set aside his own strategic judgments in favor of those of the political branch.  This becomes clearest in the run up to the fall of Berlin, when, despite his own doubts about the Soviets, Eisenhower held off American forces, at the behest of Washington, in order that the Russians might take the city.  Though he might have fought the point harder had he not been ambivalent about the value of the city as propaganda and its worth as a military asset, it is nonetheless the case, as Mr. D'Este shows, that Eisenhower considered such decisions to be ultimately political and therefore above his pay grade.  Thus, his greatness as a hero of democracy.<br />On the other hand, there is a high price to be paid when what are also necessarily military questions are left entirely to the political class and the world was to pay an enormous cost, and Eisenhower was to pay it in his presidency, for clinging to the delusion that the Soviet Union was a reliable ally.  If Eisenhower did not comprehend on the intellectual level--as did military geniuses like Patton, Curtis LeMay, and Churchill--that a reckoning with the Soviets was absolutely essential, he appears, from Mr. D'Este's somewhat contradictory account, to have felt it in his guts.  Had he turned to the best military thinkers he may well have followed those instincts, but in accepting the views of politicos instead he effectively sentenced the world to a fifty year Cold War.  Thus his tragedy, that in doing what was clearly right from a democratic standpoint, he did great harm to that democracy and the rest of the world.  He is then, at one and the same time, blameless and blameworthy.  There is no easy answer to how he might have done otherwise, though Mr. D'Este does drop some hints.<br />Even at that early stage there was already significant tension between the Americans and the Russians and it seems possible, maybe even likely, that had Eisenhower simply given his commanders in the field somewhat freer reign they would have come into contact and then conflict with their Soviet counterparts.  Likewise, had Patton just been given the go ahead he'd have taken Berlin and provoked a firestorm, possibly a literal one, with the Soviet Union.  In this regard, there's an especially poignant moment in the book :<br />  [E]isenhower revealed privately to Patton that he was soon to halt the First and Ninth Armies at the Elbe River to await the arrival of the Red<br />  Army.  Third Army would be given a new mission to drive southeast toward Czechoslovakia.  \\"From a tactical point of view, it is highly<br />  inadvisable for the American Army to take Berlin and I hope political influence won't cause me to take the city,\\" he said.  \\"It has no tactical<br />  or strategic value and would place upon the American forces the burden of caring for thousands and thousands of Germans, displaced persons<br />  and Allied prisoners of war.\\"<br />  Patton's reaction was incredulity.  \\"Ike, I don't see how you figure that out.  We had better take Berlin, and quick--and on to the Oder!\\"<br />  Later on, in the presence of his chief of staff, Patton reiterated the need to drive on to Berlin, arguing that it could certainly be done in<br />  forty-eight hours by Ninth Army.  Eisenhower, wondered aloud, \\"Well, who would want it?\\"  Patton did not reply at once, but placed both<br />  hands on his friend's shoulders and said, \\"I think history will answer that question for you.\\"<br />Now even if Ike was not always as obtuse on the question as his statements to Patton suggest (one assumes he may have felt he needed to be overly direct with Patton) and even if his decision was defensible given the time and the place, who today can reasonably quarrel with Patton's devastating judgment?  Certainly the amount of room that Mr. D'Este devotes to discussing General Eisenhower's decisions in regard to the Soviets suggests that even a favorably disposed biographer suspects that history agrees with Patton, not Ike.<br />So, in a fitting sense, the tragedy of Eisenhower is that the very thing that made him great, his democratic nature, made what should have been the pinnacle of his career into a far more ambiguous moment.  As important as the defeat of the Nazis was, by leaving the Soviets in control of Russia and the East, we essentially swapped one form of totalitarianism for another, thus calling into question the very point of the war.  But it is one of the tragic flaws of democracy (or at least of American democracy) that the deaths of its citizens are so horrible to contemplate that even once provoked into war there's an overwhelming tendency to end the war before it's been fought to completion, a tendency that frequently makes the peace worse than the further war that was avoided.  Just in the 20th Century the United States too soon put an end to hostilities--nearly always unilaterally--in WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Somalia.  Eisenhower may then be seen to have reflected what is best and what is least fortunate about the democratic way of waging war, making him both the quintessential American soldier and a paradoxical figure of tragedy.<br />GRADE : Ayou figure that out.

In 5th<br />Grade an especially wise teacher exploited a glimmer of interest in explorers and pirates to get me to read just about every book I could find on the great European Age of Exploration and the attendant age of piracy.  From Columbus to Ponce de Leon to LaSalle to Drake, I read them all with the promiscuity of the new enthusiast.  Of course, one thing led to another and soon novels like Swiss Family Robinson and Treasure Island and Robinson Crusoe and the Hornblower books were stacked up on bookshelves like planes at a busy airport, waiting their turns to land and disgorge their contents. And then you had the movies...besides versions of the books above you had Peter Pan, Mutiny on the Bounty, Captain Blood,  and, of course, Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd (1952)  with Charles Laughton, better remembered as Captain Bligh, reprising his role from Captain Kidd.  Even Cap'n Crunch cereal fed a kids fantasies of taking to the sea in a wooden ship and finding adventure there.  Thus did sailing men, even the rascals and dastards among them, like Captain Kidd, light a fire in at least one young mind.<br />All of which makes it a particularly pleasant experience to read this entertaining and authoritative rehabilitation of Kidd by Richard Zacks.  As Mr. Zacks shows in exhaustive, and perhaps a bit exhausting, detail, William Kidd was not really the scoundrel pirate of legend but a duly deputized privateer, sent out to capture pirates in exchange for a share of their loot. It was only through a series of unfortunate mishaps and the repeated intervention of a hitherto uncelebrated nemesis, Robert Culliford, that Kidd himself came to be accused of piracy and ended up dangling from the end of a rope.  Mr. Zacks relates the sorrowful tale of Kidd's 1696 expedition, that set out from Manhattan aboard the Adventure Galley but ended on a London gallows in 1701.<br />Mr. Zacks is a zealous advocate for Kidd's innocence and his passion is contagious.  But Kidd makes for a doomed and tragic hero, what with a mutinous crew, an unsturdy ship, feckless backers, and the bedeviling presence time and again of his rival, Culliford. Kidd's behavior, as presented here, is genuinely admirable, particularly his determination to clear his name after he'd been wrongly accused of piracy in the taking of two ships.  Kidd essentially put his own neck in the noose by sailing back to New York to face the charges.<br />It was in New York that the legend that he'd hidden his treasure arose, and Mr. Zacks shows us why.  In fact, this is just one of many myths and legends that Mr. Zacks lays to rest, but part of what makes the book so enchanting is that the truths he reveals are just as compelling as the fictions they replace.  In particular, despite the enduring image of ruthless captains wielding iron discipline, it's interesting to discover just how democratic the pirate society really was.  But no truth is more beguiling than the real life Captain Kidd who we're introduced to.  If the book is a bit too long and too minute by minute, which I believe to be the case, it is nonetheless carried along by Kidd and by our desire, though we know it futile, to see justice done him and barring that, our almost equally strong desire to see Culliford and some of the others who wronged Kidd get their comeuppances. But few do and as for Kidd :<br />  William Kidd, born in Dundee, married in New York, hanged in London, was then hoisted in chains onto the oak gibbet at Tilbury.  For years<br />  afterward, men and women aboard all ships going to and coming from the trading metropolis of London could see him there swaying in the<br />  breezes, the Admiralty's stark warning to anyone contemplating the merry life of piracy.<br />The poor benighted Captain would have to wait three hundred years for Richard Zacks to come along and set the record straight, which with the help of a painstakingly assembled historical record and a key piece of evidence uncovered in 1911 in the dense thickets of the British bureaucracy he does.<br />GRADE : A-nd set the record straight, which with the help of a painstakingly assembled historical record and a key piece of evidence uncovered in 1911 in the dense thickets of the British bureaucracy he does. <br />GRADE : A-	2002-09-07

Books	4	4	6	N	N	what a mess	I'm unashamed to admit that my perceptions of several historical crises--especially Suez and the Cuban Missile Crisis--are shaped by rhetorical asides in the novels of James Clavell.  Mr. Clavell, in Noble House, convincingly portrays both as catastrophes for the West.  The result of the Missile Crisis was that JFK promised that the U.S. would no longer try to topple Castro.  Forty years later we see the foolishness of that pledge.  Meanwhile, in the Suez Crisis, America gratuitously humiliated its own democratic allies, ending even the illusion that Britain and France were still significant geopolitical players, while boosting a Middle Eastern dictator.<br />Hugh Thomas--who in later years has published a series of monumental and excellent histories including Conquest : Montezuma, Cortes, and the Fall of Old Mexico and The Slave Trade--in this shortish but thorough account of the whole balls up, lays much of the blame at the feet of John Foster Dulles and a U.S. State Department that was hostile to what it mistakenly perceived as British neocolonialism.  But he also reserves healthy shares of  blame for Ike, who let Dulles his way and failed to communicate clearly that he too opposed the adventure, and for the French and British governments (especially Prime Minister Anthony Eden) who erroneously believed that Ike was still the ally they remembered from WWII.<br />Basically the Israelis sought to destroy the Egyptian military threat but also to occupy the Sinai and Gaza and the French and British sought to put a stop to the rise of Islamic nationalism, which had just seen Nasser nationalize the Suez Canal (July 26, 1956).  Military operations, begun by the Israelis on October 29, went fairly smoothly, though by simply sinking ships in the canal Nasser was easily able to make it impassable.  However, Eisenhower was infuriated, not least because he was facing re-election in a few days and had not wanted to have to rebuke Israel at the risk of losing Jewish votes in New York.  Accordingly, the U.S. sponsored a UN cease-fire resolution on November 1.  The Brits, French and Israelis withdrew and UN peace keeping forces took over supervision of the Sinai and the Gaza Strip.  In the meantime, the Soviets brutally repressed the Hungarian Revolt in early November.  So whatever Eisenhower and Dulles may have thought they'd accomplish, the result was to make it look like the Soviets had forced a withdrawal in the Middle East while crushing internal problems, thereby elevating them, and at the same time France and Britain would never again act on their own.  Having had the lost illusions of great power stripped away, they became virtual dependents of the U.S..  Even more disastrous for all concerned, these events gave added impetus to the movement for European Union and resulted in the creation of the Common Market, the initial step towards the centralized, bureaucratic nightmare that is now descending on Europe.<br />Mr. Thomas, writing from a mostly British perspective, is deeply dubious about the plausibility of the plan and the rather undemocratic and deceptive way in which Eden's government prepared, presented and pursued it.  Perhaps his most valid criticism of the entire operation is that there was really no planning for what might follow a Nasser government if things went that far.  Still, with the wisdom of hindsight, it's hard to believe things in the Middle East would be any worse today if the West had established in the 50s that it would not allow the rise of governments that were openly hostile to its interests.  And it certainly might have prevented much subsequent misery if the U.S. had allowed its allies to continue their mission while we dealt with the Soviets, intervening on Hungary's behalf.  Instead, the Cold War was allowed to drag on for another thirty years and even forty-five years on we're still dealing with the problem of Islamicist governments in the Middle East.  Even if Mr. Thomas is right and the Suez takeover was ill-considered and unlikely to be a permanent solution to the problem of Egypt, it certainly seems that the American intervention to end operations prematurely made a potentially bad situation much worse.

In the book, which grew out of an essay for the Cato Institute, HOMESCHOOLING : Back to the Future?, she looks at legal issues, the size and shape of the homeschool movement in America, questions about socialization of kids and meeting educational standards, resources that are available for families who choose this option, and even what kind of social acceptance or pressures folks may face.  Ms Lyman also uses copious real-life examples to show how others have met and overcome these challenges, as well as sharing her own experiences.  In all, it's an excellent overview of an emerging phenomena.<br />My one quibble is actually with the manner in which she tells the true stories.  It may be a function of the book being a couple years old, and that we're more used to the notion of homeschooling now, or of the aftereffects of battles Ms Lyman may have had to wage personally, or maybe I'm just naive, but the tone of some of the book, especially in these vignettes, is more defensive than it needs to be.  There's a quality of here of &quot;look this kid was homeschooled and..ta-da...he turned out fine.&quot;  There may well have been a time in this country where homeschooling was so shocking that these<br />kinds of assurances were necessary, but hopefully we''re long past that day.  Ms Lyman and her fellow homeschoolers have exciting stories to tell, stories of which they are, and should be, immensely proud.  They need not justify the choices they've made.  The achievements of their children are ample justification.  If anything it is many of those who run our public schools who need to explain what they've done to education in the last few decades.<br />Ms Lyman is an effective proselytizer for a movement she obviously cares deeply about. If you are one of those folks who are still dubious<br />about the efficacy of homeschooling, she'll more than allay your doubts. If you have kids she'll make you think hard about the options available<br />to you.  If you''re thinking about homeschooling she'll more than likely convince you to do so.  But always, as befits someone who is advocating<br />freedom of choice, she encourages parents to do what they think is right for their own kids.  Perhaps most refreshingly, Ms Lyman writes on behalf of a social/political movement that does not ask for anything from the rest of us--no tax money, no special favors, etc.--except that we accept their decisions to homeschool as a viable alternative for educating American kids.  As she argues convincingly and as test scores and other data demonstrate, homeschooling is not only viable it can be a fabulous choice for families with the determination to succeed.<br />GRADE : B+f you are one of those folks who are still dubious <BR>about the efficacy of homeschooling, she'll more than allay your doubts.

McKnight is a former Detroit policeman now living in the Upper Penninsula town of Paradise.  He was shot three times--one of the bulletts remains lodged near his heart--and his partner killed, by a madman named Maximillian Rose.  Now, as McKinight reluctantly investigates the killing of two local bookies, it seems that Rose, who is supposed to be in prison, has entered his life again.<br />Mr. Hamilton offers a mildly unconventional P. I. in McKnight, who is still openly traumatized by his shooting, and the encounter with Rose generally, and who is carrying on an affair with his friend and client's wife.  These two facets of the novel are apparently what grabbed folks' attention.  Personally, I thought they made McKnight rather off-putting.  Detectives like Lew Archer were pretty routinely frightened by the plight of their clients and would routinely fall in love with one or more of the women involved in the case, even if married--Sam Spade was even getting his phreak on with his partner's wife at the beginning of The Maltese Falcon.  So, it's hard to see these twists as particularly unusual and once you take away the novelty factor you're left with a competent but somewhat formulaic Thomas Harris copy, right down to the prison confrontation, and a detective who's hard to root for.<br />GRADE : C	2002-08-25

S. Eliot to be the best American poet of his generation.  Yet today, the only one of his poems we really recall is Ode to the Confederate Dead, and even that has a whiff of impropriety about it.  He wrote two well regarded biographies, but they're of the Confederate heroes Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis.  He was also considered an outstanding critic, but criticism has a pretty short shelf life, as each generation discovers authors anew.  He was also a participant in and a founder of important literary movements--the Fugitives, the Agrarian movement, and the New Criticism.  Yet there's a a certain stench about the politics of these groups, their celebration of Southern ideals sitting ill with the subsequent Civil Rights era.  And if Mr. Tate's ambiguous position in regard to race weren't enough to doom him in modern eyes, he was also no gentleman in his treatment of his wife, the fine writer, Caroline Gordon, to whom he was apparently quite flagrantly unfaithful.  Add to it all the unfortunate fact that regard for the Confederacy and the Ante-Bellum South has been co-opted to some extent by white supremacists and other idiots and it's surely no surprise that Mr. Tate's reputation has fared poorly.<br />With all this as baggage, the reader who comes to The Fathers, Mr. Tate's only novel, expecting some kind of gothic version of Gone With the Wind must be forgiven.  Instead, while it is fairly Southern gothic, what Mr. Tate offers is a far more complex portrait of a young man, Lacy Buchan, who is torn between the world of his father, Major Lewis Buchan, representing the stereotypical Southern aristocracy, but paralyzed into inaction by the war, and George Posey, Lacy's brother-in-law, a modern man (for example, a capitalist) whose lack of ties to the chivalric tradition lead him to behave in an undisciplined fashion, eventually resulting in tragedy.  Lacy's struggle then is to find a middle way, one that learns from and honors the traditions of his father, but which is capable of moving forward into the modern age that George presages, or perhaps into a better future, because tempered by tradition.<br />The novel is a tad opaque and overwrought for my tastes, but well worth reading.<br />GRADE : C+n, Lacy Buchan, who is torn between the world of his father, Major Lewis Buchan, representing the stereotypical Southern aristocracy, but paralyzed into inaction by the war, and George Posey, Lacy's brother-in-law, a modern man (for example, a capitalist) whose lack of ties to the chivalric tradition lead him to behave in an undisciplined fashion, eventually resulting in tragedy.

At first I just assumed that the George Lucas had based his film on the book, but it gradually dawned that, to the contrary, the screenplay had been the source of a quickie book.  (As I recall, the book is credited to Lucas, but I think Alan Dean Foster actually wrote it.) It seemed sort of like a rip-off to me even at an early age and I've been suspicious of books that are also movies ever since.  So when I found this one, with scenes from the fine Jimmy Stewart film on the cover and a big movie announcement on the back, I looked it over carefully to make sure that the book had come first.  Imagine my surprise when a little research turned up the fact that not only was Elleston Trevor a well regarded author, but he was also the writer known as Adam Hall, who wrote the Quiller series of spy novels, the first of which, The Quiller Memorandum, was voted the 1965 Edgar Allan Poe Award by the Mystery Writers of America.  Indeed, Elleston Trevor turns out to be a synonym too, for an Englishman, born Trevor Dudley Smith.<br />In Flight of the Phoenix, Elleston Trevor (for that was what he had his name legally changed to) gives us a harrowing tale of survival against the elements and human frailties in the Saharan desert.  Fourteen men and a monkey, returning from the Libyan oilfields, live through a plane crash, but are left without food, water, or a radio, and because a sandstorm had blown them off course, no one is looking for them.  The pilot, Frank Towns, is so caught up in justifiably blaming himself that he is nearly ready to give up.  But his navigator, Lew Moran, coaxes him towards survival and mediates between the rest of the group and Stringer, a young, arrogant, and hypersensitive engineer who has figured out a way to cobble together a jerry-rigged smaller plane from the wreckage of the original.  Stringer, though unbearably officious, is in all likelihood their only way out, if Moran can keep him from storming off in a fit of pique and keep the others from killing him.<br />Also among the survivors are Trucker Cobb, a chief driller being sent home from the fields because he's begun to lose his mind and Captain Harris, a gung-ho, by-the-book, British officer and several of his less enthusiastic men.  There's also Roberts, who, in a gesture of insane but touching tenderness is giving his water ration to the monkey.  Together they form an ill-matched group and as thirst, starvation, exposure, madness, and desperation turn up the torque, social order and morality and simple human decency are shunted aside and the men begin to turn on one another.

He's on his fourth wife, Babbette and has four kids and what I think most of us would say is an excessive fear of modern life and of his own death. Of the book Mr. DeLillo has said :<br />[A]ll I can say about White Noise...is that the book is driven by a connection I sensed between advanced technology and contemporary fear. By the former I don't mean bombs and missiles alone but more or less everything -- microwaves, electrical insulation etc. One would have to write a long dense essay to explain this connection adequately -- that's why I wrote a loose-limbed and shadow-sliding work of fiction.<br />As it happens, Jack's fear of technology turns out to be justified when a toxic chemical cloud is unleashed in the area and he is terminally poisoned. But it is in his fear of death that I think Mr. DeLillo loses his way.<br />Jack fears death precisely because he believes in nothing. For such a person the self is all that matters, so the prospect of one's own death must be terrifying. For with your own death the world, for all intents and purposes, comes to an end. Your own death is the Apocalypse. Now, Jack has a friend, Murray Jay Siskind, who serves as kind of the Greek chorus of the book. When Jack is dying, Murray tells him :<br />\\"I believe, Jack, there are two kinds of people in the world. Killers and diers. Most of us are diers. We don't have the disposition, the rage or whatever it takes to be a killer. We let death happen. We lie down and die. But think what it's like to be a killer. Think how exciting it is, in theory, to kill a person in direct confrontation. If he dies, you cannot. To kill him is to gain life credit. The more people you kill, the more  credit you store up. It explains any number ofÊ massacres, wars, executions.\\"<br />This theory also explains much of the 20th century--from genocide to abortion--if we accept that murder has become a way for a people who no longer believe in anything beyond themselves to try to pretend that they have some kind of power over death. But it is of course a delusion. All the murders in the world--as Jack's subject, Hitler, demonstrates--won't extend your life by one minute. And even if they could, what would be the point, since we've already decided that our lives are meaningless?<br />So what Mr. DeLillo has done here is to set up an elaborate joke. We can see how foolish these beliefs are and how destructive. It's clear that such theories, though intended to empower us, have left us empty; our lives dissatisfying; our mortality devastating, even though inevitable; and the morality which once gave our lives a sense of purpose discardedso that we may pursue personal pleasures which fail to fulfill. surely the point of the novel, after all this, must be that this is all a huge mistake. Right? We have to have been building to the moment when Toto rips away the curtain and the post-modern Wizard is exposed as a fraud, haven't we? The answer, inexplicably, is : no. And so we feel the air rush out of the balloon just as we thought Mr. DeLillo was ready to let it fly.<br />Jack does indeed try to claim a life credit by hunting down the quack who's been giving the drug Dylar--sort of an anticipation of Prozac that quiets fears--to Babbette. But there's nothing empowering about the scene; it's merely embarrassing. When Jack takes himself and his victim, both wounded, to the hospital, he meets a nun, Sister Hermann Marie. He questions her about her faith, but she reveals that the religious have none either, their seeming piety is all an act :<br />\\"It is for others. Not for us.\\"<br />\\"But that's ridiculous. what others?\\"<br /> \\"All the others. The others who spend their lives believing that we still believe. It is our task in the world to believe things no one else takes seriously. To abandon such beliefs completely, the human race would die. This is why we are here.Ê A tiny minority. Toembody old things, old beliefs. The devil, the angels, heaven, hell. If we did not pretend to believe these things, the world would collapse.\\"<br />It is here that Mr. DeLillo goes too far because he shows us that the joke is apparently on him.Ê He seems to be a Jack Gladney, believing nothing, obsessed with death, one of T.S. Eliot's hollow men. That suffices to make him ridiculous, but he goes beyond that to claim that those who are not withered up must be pretending to believe in something, and to claim that even the pretend believers are a tiny minority, dwarfed by the more honest unbelievers. This is simply untrue, at least here in America, where the great majority have utterly traditional and conventional religious beliefs and a certainty that every life has a purpose..<br />The extreme skeptics though have always been a part of Western Civilization and they always will be. For the perverse truth is that we can not even prove that we exist, that we are not merely a dream. Actually, no one has yet bettered Samuel Johnson's amusing but unsatisfactory response when asked how he would refute Hume or Berkeley's theory that we can not know with certainty that anything exists. Dr. Johnson turned and kicked a boulder, saying : \\"I refute it thus!\\" But not even the skeptics (and Johnson was one) can accept the implications of their own ideas, else they'd give up. They'd certainly not try to communicate ideas if those ideas mean nothing. If the post-modernists had the courage of their convictions they not write, and even the best of them, an Albert Camus or a Don DeLillo, would not be much missed.<br />GRADE : Cnority.

On April 17, 1975, the American military having been withdrawn from Southeast Asia, Phnom Penh fell to the<br />Khmer Rouge, its citizens disappearing into Pol Pot's Killing Fields.  For this the American Right will always blame the Left.  It seems we've all got something<br />to ashamed of in how the U.S. treated Cambodia.  But largely forgotten between these infamous dates, and amid the bickering over which Americans treated<br />the Cambodians worse, are the courageous and selfless efforts of the Flying Tigers, noncombatant flyers who airlifted tons of supplies into the besieged<br />Cambodian capital in the weeks before it fell.  Larry Partridge was one of those pilots, a volunteer.  In March 1975, he flew 52 missions in operation \\"Ricelift\\"<br />and he tells the story here.<br />He's reconstructed his tale from a diary he kept at the time, so it's understandably prosaic at times.  And it doesn't have the usual shape of a war story, because<br />the planes he flew--including a DC-8 named Phnom Penh Phnancy--weren't dealing death, but bringing life.  But it is this unique aspect of his peaceful<br />mission set against the wartime background, and his friendship with crewmates and comrades, like Jim Winterberg, and with locals, like a young newspaper girl<br />named Maria, and even with a cockroach they called Hiram, that makes this an exceedingly human and humane story, all the more remarkable because that<br />war zone has produced so few.<br />Larry Partridge has given us a heroic and heartwarming vision of a different side of America's generally tragic engagement with Southeast Asia.

We picked up The Book That Jack Wrote first, mostly because the paintings by Daniel Adel are absolutely<br />extraordinary, though the rhyme, by Jon Scieszka, based on the classic The House that Jack Built, is fun too.  Then I realized that Mr. Scieszka was the author<br />of both The Stinky Cheese Man, which you often see on recommended book lists, and The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs, which several other authors of<br />childrens' books had chosen as one of their favorites in Salon Magazine several years ago.  So now we own all three and read them almost every night.<br />It's somewhat absurd that we refer to the use of self-reference and the ironic blend of fact and fiction within fiction as post-modern, since such elements were<br />used in one of the first novels ever written, Don Quijote, and have never gone terribly far out of fashion since.  Nor is childrens' literature a stranger to these<br />techniques, as a generation of parents who were raised on Jay Ward's Fractured Fairy Tales can well attest.  But Mr. Scieszka is an adept practitioner of the<br />style and it does tend to make kids' books easier for adults to read and enjoy.<br />The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs is written from the perspective of Alexander T. Wolf as he explains that the whole story is really just a big<br />misunderstanding, mostly the result of sensationalistic journalism.  Meanwhile, The Stinky Cheese Man is a rather more pungent version of the Gingerbread<br />Man, who can't even get anyone to run, run, run as fast as they can to catch him because of the awful stench he gives off.  The illustrations in these two, by<br />Lane Smith, are less stunning than those by Mr. Adel in The Book That Jack Wrote, but go well with the somewhat manic mood of the stories.<br />You can't go wrong with any of the three, but be warned, your kids will require repeated readings of each or all.<br />Book that Jack Wrote :  Text : B  Paintings : A+<br />True Story of the 3 Little Pigs and Stinky Cheese Man : Text : A  Illustrations : BStory of the 3 Little Pigs and Stinky Cheese Man : Text : A  Illustrations : B	2002-07-13

Rethinking the Past in a Changing World	Books	1	14	73	N	N	Not Mr. Foner	To take just one example of the dilemma that Mr. Foner must confront as the Left loses control of history and of our institutions, let's look briefly at his essay<br />&quot;Blacks and the U.S. Constitution&quot;.  Here he argues against the idea that judges should be bound by the text of the Constitution, arguing instead that it should<br />be an &quot;active advocate for the rights of disadvantaged Americans&quot; as it basically was in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.  Unfortunately, he contradicts himself so baldly as<br />to render his point incoherent.  Here he is rejecting adherence to the text :<br />  In an age of semiotics and deconstruction, not to mention intense debate among historians about the prevailing ideas of the revolutionary era,<br />  there is something refreshingly naive, almost quaint, in the idea that any text, including the Constitution, possesses a single, easily ascertainable,<br />  objective meaning.<br />On its face this is fairly unobjectionable.  Were we still in an age when deconstruction and other Leftist philosophies, that seek to deny the plain meaning of<br />language and to expose the secret oppressive messages that straight white Christian males placed there, and were there a significant national debate over what<br />the ideas of the Revolution were, then it would indeed be possible to say that the meaning of the Constitution is unknowable.  It is, of course, a considerable<br />impediment to Mr. Foner's argument that the basic concept of deconstruction is practically unknown outside of the humanities departments of elite universities<br />and that average Americans seem to feel that they pretty well understand the ideas of the Revolution, chief among which was that the laws that govern us<br />should be made by our elected representatives.  But even more troublesome for Mr. Foner is his own admission a few pages later that :<br />  To those who came of age during the era of the Warren Court, it is easy to forget that the Supreme Court, expected by the founding fathers<br />  to be the most conservative branch of the government, has amply fulfilled that role throughout most of our history.  And today the Court<br />  appears poised to revert to its traditional function.<br />Lo and behold, here's the good professor himself informing us that, far from being quaint or naive, the Right's belief that the judiciary was intended to be a<br />fundamentally conservative institution is consistent with both the expectations of the founding fathers and with long-standing tradition.  In fact, as these<br />contradictory statements reveal, the problem is not that history can't reveal to us the purposes of the drafters of the Constitution but that those purposes are at<br />odds with Mr. Foner's purposes and at odds with the liberal departure from tradition that characterized the past several decades.<br />The question on the cover of the book may ask &quot;Who Owns History?&quot;, but the question that drives these essays is much more &quot;why don't we (The Left) own it<br />anymore?&quot;.  But Mr. Foner doesn't really make an honest attempt to answer either question and so the utility of the book is fairly limited.  What we get instead<br />is a rather disconnected series of essays which in sum seem to argue merely that those who are now retaking ownership of history shouldn't be allowed<br />to--whether they be non-communist historians in the former Soviet Union, black South Africans who are more interested in making social progress than in<br />rehashing the past, PBS filmmakers seeking to honor the nation's bloody struggle to end slavery, or judges who think they should be bound by the<br />Constitution.  Ultimately, Mr. Foner's argument appears to be with American people themselves who &quot;often 'forget' that our history is not a Whiggish<br />progress toward greater and greater freedom and equality but a far more complex story...&quot;  Or it may be that since so many Americans (and I) believe it to be<br />the case that our history does in fact demonstrate just such Whiggish progress, that Mr. Foner's argument is with history itself.<br />GRADE : Fat our history does in fact demonstrate just such Whiggish progress, that Mr. Foner's argument is with history itself. <br />GRADE : F	2002-07-13

Both posit the notion that Man in the State of Nature led a peaceful and bucolic existence--for the Left a communal one, for the Right a rugged-individualist one--where want was unknown, evil did not exist, and no man coveted the goods of another. Where conservatism and Judeo-Christianty generally assume that Man carried a flaw (the capacity for sin) deep within himself, these two philosophies instead assume that it was artificial human institutions that corrupted Man. The Left believes that the problem is capitalism. The Right blames government. But both view these intermediary structures as having a baleful influence on the relationships among men and are certain that if they could only be removed we'd return to Paradise. It's entirely predictable then that Report from Iron Mountain, which began as a satire of capitalism and the military-industrial complex, ended up hoodwinking both Left and Right and becoming conspiracy fodder for the loons at both ends of the political spectrum.<br />The book is presented in the form of a secret report, prepared by an anonymous government commission, on the feasability of moving towards a society based on permanent peace instead of permanent war. At the heart of the hoax lies the patently absurd, but profoundly Leftist, idea that for capitalism to succeed the economy must be structured around governmental preparations for and prosecution of war. This is a concept that Paul M. Kennedy more than adequately debunked in his poorly timed but eminently worthwhile book, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000 (1987)(Paul Kennedy 1945-). But even a casual observer might have been expected to notice how rare a large military budget was in America's first 150 reasonably capitalist years and how poorly the economy was faring under the increasing strains of permanent war. At any rate, when the book came out, in 1967, its thesis meshed perfectly with the belief that the U.S. was a war-mongering, imperialist, hegemony. Little wonder that Leonard Lewin's hoax--aided and abetted by folks like Victor Navasky, E. L. Doctorow, and J. K. Galbraith--was accepted by many as a genuine leak of a serious government report. Oliver Stone notoriously adopted the basic argument about capitalism requiring war as the rationale for why Kennedy was killed in the immensely silly film JFK.<br />If the problem Mr. Lewin identified appealed to the delusions of the Left though, the remedy he proposed played to the paranoia of the Right, particularly the latter-day militias and white separatists of the 1990s. For in the section of the report titled \\"Substitutes for the Function of War\\", we are presented with an array of totalitarian government actions, up to and including a global police force, eugenics, and slavery. For guys who fear the black helicopters of the U.N. this was music to their ears. So when the Feds descended on the militias after the Oklahoma City bombing, one of the surprising things they found was that a whole new generation of extremists, this time from the Right instead of the Left, had accepted the Report from Iron Mountain as the gospel truth.<br />The book is really most interesting for its hoax effect and for its demonstration of the odd convergence of Far Left and Far Right. It's an amusing curio, but not much more. It offers definitive proof that, as H. L. Mencken said (or nearly said) : no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people.<br />GRADE : Cpermanent war.

At a moment when the visceral American reaction was inevitably to see Muslims as profoundly \\"other\\", the e-mail was a reminder that no matter how different some aspects of their culture, Islamic immigrants were, and are, Americans too.<br />In this memoir, Tamim Ansary tells the story of growing up in Afghanistan and of the culture shock he endured moving from a traditional Muslim culture to<br />modern America. Improbably enough, Mr. Ansary's mother was American--his parents may have been the first Afghan man and American woman ever to marry. His father was a government official, so the family was reasonably well off by Afghani standards, living in comfortable houses in Kabul and sending the kids to good schools, but they were still very much connected to the customs and rhythms of ancient Afghanistan, a way of life that is dominated by the extended family, the clan, and Islam. Mr. Ansary's depiction of this world he grew up in is, I think, the most useful part of the book. He moves Muslim life beyond the caricatured way in which we currently perceive it, with its angry mullahs and its suicide bombers, and reveals a very appealing face of Islam, in which the aspiration is to peace and justice and where the communality and regularity of the daily prayers are more important than anti-Zionism and anti-Westernism. The Afghanistan of his childhood featured an Islam that still defined itself and was sufficient, rather than measuring itself against the West and failing the test.<br />At age sixteen, Mr. Ansary left Afghanistan for high school in America and has lived here ever since. He became a writer and, oddly enough, a part of West Coast counterculture. But when his brother, Riaz, became something of a Muslim extremist himself, Mr. Ansary undertook a long journey through the Islamic world, just as it was being radicalized in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian Revolution. The middle portion of the book describes his experiences in this transformed world and is futile attempt to return to his occupied homeland. He found, traveling mainly from Northern Africa to Turkey an Islamic world that was increasing focussed not just on the comforting and familiar Muslim traditions and observances, but on the strict observance of sharia:<br /> 'The sharia,' I said. 'Yes, that's what people have trouble with. It seems like such a harsh legal code. The cutting off of hands--'<br /> 'You have to understand that the sharia is much more than a legal system,' he said, interrupting me. 'All the elements of the sharia--the rules of inheritance, the punishments set down for different crimes, the proscriptions about food and dress and all the rest of it--are like markers. They show where the road is. That's what sharia means--it is the way. The rules are not restrictive, as people think, because within the sharia, a Muslim is free. So long as the people of a community stay on the road, they progress toward the light. When they stray from the road, that's when they get into brambles and thorns.'<br />Confronted by this much more legalistic and authoritarian form of Islamic life, Mr. Ansary realized that there was no longer any place for him in the East and he returned to the West for good, becoming \\"Tamim Ansary, American guy\\".<br />Or so he thought, but then the events of last September intervened, and he found himself caught between his native and his adopted lands and between two cultures in conflict. His email expressed some of his angst over the dilemma, this book--though not always astute in its analyses of situations; rather elliptical, even opaque at times, in its storytelling; and not particularly distinguished in terms of style--further adds to our understanding of what it must be like to be<br />caught between Islam and America. As Mr. Ansary says :<br /> Growing up bicultural is like straddling a crack in the earth.<br />Whether intentional or not, this seeming metaphor cuts awfully close to the reality of September 11th, when the earth swallowed the Trade Centers, but it also captures the sense of how this outrage divided the soul of Mr. Ansary and folks like him (or revealed the divides that already existed). There's more than enough anguish to go around in the wake of that awful day, and many people were affected much more directly than Mr. Ansary--specifically the dead and those they left behind--but West of Kabul is an important reminder that many of our fellow citizens were affected in a unique way, as one culture they love suffered grievous harm at the hands of another culture they love. Perhaps they can also serve as a unique source of healing as we try to close the divide between the two.

The story centers around, Claire Beauchamp Randall,<br />a British nurse who's just been demobbed at the end of WWII.  On a visit to her husband's native region of Scotland, she is mysteriously transported back in time to the 1740s, where she becomes romantically involved<br />with Jamie Fraser, a young, and we soon discover \\"inexperienced\\" Highlander.  The two marry but run afoul of a brutal English overlord, \\"Black Jack\\" Randall, who Claire realizes she can't kill because he's her real<br />husband's ancestor.<br />That's all well and good--set up nicely, with lots of authentic color thrown in--except for one thing : we know that given the conventions of the genre that Black Jack must disrupt the romance, but in an<br />ultra-modern twist it turns out that his great lust is for Jamie rather than for Claire.  Even that would be okay, it's actually pleasingly incorrect to make him more evil because of his vile homosexual desires, but then Ms<br />Gabaldon goes one very disconcerting step further.  When Black Jack captures the couple, Jamie agrees to be his plaything if Claire is let go.  Then, when Claire manages to free Jamie, he confesses that he became<br />aroused during Black Jack's assaults.  And there Ms Gabaldon loses me.<br />I'm perfectly willing to concede that I'm a repressed Puritanical man of the 1690s trying to relate to a novel of the 1990s.  And I have no problem admitting that what I don't understand about women would fill<br />libraries.  But is there truly something sexy to women about the notion of a man responding positively to his own torture and rape?  Does the modern woman really want her man to be quite that submissive and in touch<br />with his feminine side?  Man, oh man, women are strange creatures...<br />GRADE : C-	2002-06-16

Baseball has more truly great writing<br />than the others--from songs and poems, like Take Me Out to the Ballgame and Casey at the Bat; to daily journalism, like Red Smith's Miracle at Coogan's Bluff; to essays, like John Updike's Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu;<br />to classic novels like Bang the Drum Slowly; to even great B-movies, like It Happens Every Spring--but fishing literature offers perhaps the most consistently high quality of writing (I don't think it has many songs,<br />poems, or movies and only a handful of worthwhile novels).<br />The great Red Smith of course excelled in writing about all of these sports and his fishing essays are marvelous.  Robert Traver--perhaps best remembered now for Anatomy of a Murder, with its fishing-mad<br />attorney--wrote a number of great essays, collected in Trout Magic and Trout Madness.  Nowadays, John Gierach seems incapable of putting pen to paper without producing an amusing fishing tale.  All in all,<br />there's an embarrassment of riches to choose from.  It seems not too much to say that you can grab nearly any collection of fishing essays and find writing of a high standard.  In fact, it may be looking a gift horse in the<br />mouth, but there's so much good writing about fishing that it takes on a certain sameness--all those magnificent trout rising to the mayfly hatches in Montana and Idaho start to blend together at some point.  So,<br />though it seem perverse, it takes more than \\"just\\" great writing to get at least this casual fan to grab a new fishing book.  An author'd better have a well-barbed hook, to haul us in.<br />Ian Frazier's writing reputation precedes him--author of such well regarded books as On the Rez and Great Plains--but what's most appealing about this collection of his essays, mostly from The New Yorker and<br />Outside, is that many of them, especially the early ones, concern the fishing in and around Manhattan.  Mr. Frazier takes this unlikely environs and lets us see that its just as fish-happy as any stretch of the Big<br />Blackfoot River.  There are also some really lovely reminiscences of boyhood, including a charming essay about his Dad, who would become so disturbed by the notion of his son catching and hurting a fish that today it<br />is those occasions when he gets skunked that remind Mr. Frazier most clearly of his father.  For my tastes the book loses a little steam when Mr. Frazier moves his family out West.  Suddenly we're back in the<br />familiar--to me overfamiliar--waters of Montana.  But such quibbles are more than forgiven because of a few quite humorous essays that are mixed in. One on eating bugs is quite good and one, called Bad Advice,<br />has an opening scene that's as funny as anything I've ever read anywhere.  I hope I'll be forgiven for quoting at length :<br />  Some years ago, on a camping trip in the pine woods of northern Michigan, my friend Don brought along a copy of an outdoor cookbook<br />  that appeared on the best-seller lists at the time. This book contained many ingenious and easy-sounding recipes; one that Don especially<br />  wanted to try was called \\"Breakfast in a Paper Bag.\\" According to this recipe, you could take a small paper lunch sack, put strips of bacon<br />  in the bottom, break an egg into the sack on top of the bacon, fold down the top of the sack, push a stick through the fold, hold the sack<br />  over hot coals, and cook the bacon and egg in the sack in about ten minutes.<br />  I watched as Don followed the directions exactly. Both he and I remarked that we would naturally have thought the sack would burn;<br />  the recipe, however, declared, \\"grease will coat the bottom of the bag as it cooks.\\" Somehow we both took this to mean that the grease,<br />  counterintuitively, actually made the bag less likely to burn. Marveling at the \\"who would have guessed\\" magic of it, we picked a good spot<br />  in the hot coals of our campfire, and Don held the sack above them. We watched. In a second and a half, the bag burst into leaping flames.<br />  Don was yelling for help, waving the bag around trying to extinguish it, scattering egg yolk and smoldering strips of bacon and flaming paper<br />  into the combustible pines while people at adjoining campfires stared in horror and wondered what they should do.<br />That's just good stuff and, by itself, makes the book worth reading.<br />GRADE : B+ng at the \\"who would have guessed\\" magic of it, we picked a good spot <BR>    in the hot coals of our campfire, and Don held the sack above them.

It's kind of a case of life imitating art imitating life, or vice versa.  At any rate, these 18 short stories are wonderful in themselves, filled with small town prospects looking for that one big break and veterans on the back sides of their careers, looking for just one more moment of magic.  But there's an added pleasure when we realize that the aged pitcher Grover Bell, in The Last Pitch, is based on the immortal Grover Cleveland Alexander, or that Dane Bjorland, in Flashing Spikes, is modeled after the notorious shortstop of the Black Sox, Swede Risberg.  And in the centerpiece of the collection, The Heavenly World Series, Mr. O'Rourke brings many of the great departed players back to life (sort of) for a match up in the great beyond to determine, once and for all, whether the Nationals or the Americans have the better League.  With John McGraw managing the National League and Miller Huggins commanding the American and Bill Klem umpiring--the only ump to make it to Heaven--even the Lord wonders if this is a good idea.<br />Now, I'm a pretty big baseball fan and a lover of baseball writing, and I've got to admit I hadn't heard of Mr. O'Rourke until this book.  I was so surprised at that, upon<br />discovering the quality of the writing here that I checked my three volumes of the Fireside Books of Baseball and there's not a single one of his stories anthologized there.  One of the more intriguing things I found was that there was a TV-movie version of Flashing Spikes directed by John Ford and starring James Stewart and Jack Warden, with cameos by Vin Scully and Harry Caray, Jr.  What wouldn't you give to see that one?--but it looks to be out of print. Most of Mr. O'Rourke's novels appear to have been Westerns, but of course the Western has mostly had its day. So the legacy of Mr. O'Rourke would appear to have been at a low ebb, but, thankfully, his widow and the folks at Carroll &amp; Graf have put together this superb collection and hopefully it will serve to resurrect his reputation.

Bush	Books	5	4	8	N	N	twin tales	One of Mr. Bruni's other important criticisms, and it's very much a self-criticism, is that the members of the press generally fail to understand the role of religious faith in George W. Bush's life :<br /> Bush's spirituality was perhaps crucial to his ability to handle himself so well in public--and by all accounts, in private--after the attacks.  Reporters in general tended not to look for or consider this kind of influence, because so few of them put all that much stock in religion,  which they associated with extreme political views based on moral disapproval and condemnation. I confess to membership in this group.  And perhaps because of this prejudice, which is probably the right thing to call it, administration officials seldom dwelled on Bush's faith  when they described the way he was coping at difficult junctures.<br />This is a pretty shocking admission. It's almost impossible to imagine that the NY Times or any other major media outlet would put someone with racial prejudices on a story about race, or a person with little understanding of Russian culture on the Russia beat, yet they see no problem in having reporters with religious prejudices, or no understanding of religion at any rate, cover a subject where religion is a key component of the story. Mustn't this effect how the story is reported? It's great that Mr. Bruni recognizes the centrality of religious belief in Mr. Bush's life now, but how different might his reportage during the campaign have been if he'd realized it in 1999?<br />Mr. Bruni's admissions of press weaknesses are admirable, but because of this honesty his dual stories do sometimes seem at odds with one another. It is hard in places to tell whether he's describing a genuine flaw in George W. Bush's character or whether the vagaries of the press coverage are at work. Likewise, in explaining the ups and downs of the race and the early days of his presidency (into late 2001) one wonders which were the genuine downs and which were merely created by the press itself. The overarching question becomes : having acknowledged the degree to which the press creates its own stories and that he, and others, fundamentally misunderstood Mr. Bush until September 11th, 2001, how trustworthy should we consider a reporter's account of the 2000 campaign? I think the answer is, necessarily, that one has to read the campaign coverage through the filter of the press critique. Mr. Bruni in some ways teaches us to distrust his own account of the campaign. But both stories are quite fascinating and the book is wonderfully readable. Better books may come, but for now I think it's the best we have on George W. Bush and one of the better, at least in recent years, on the press.<br />GRADE : A-merely created by the press itself.

As you can imagine from the title,  the book presents famous fairy tales as retold for our current era of politically correct doublespeak.<br />From the first paragraph of the first story :<br />  There once was a young person named Red Riding Hood who lived with her mother on the edge of a large wood. One day her mother asked<br />  her to take a basket of fresh fruit and mineral water to her grandmother's house--not because this was womyn's work, mind you, but because<br />  the deed was generous and helped engender a feeling of community. Furthermore, her grandmother was not sick, but rather was in full<br />  physical and mental health and was fully capable of taking care of herself as a mature adult.<br />you pretty much know what follows.  Mr. Garner gets a lot of mileage out of the mere terminology of PC--as when the Seven Dwarfs are referred to as \\"vertically challenged\\" or when  Three Little Pigs ends with the disclaimer : \\"Please note: The wolf in this story was a metaphorical construct. No actual wolves were harmed in the writing of the story.\\"--without even having to tell jokes or toy with the narrative to produce more humorous situations.<br />For my money, the book's best moment comes in \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" :<br />  Word had spread about the emperor's new clothes that only enlightened people with healthy lifestyles could see, and everyone was determined  to be more right-minded than his or her neighbor.<br />Such is the conceit that surrounds political correctness too, that by torturing the English language and disavowing or rewriting much of our own<br />history and classic literature, we will magically be transformed into more \\"enlightened\\" people and will be better than our ancestors or our less<br />enlightened neighbors.  But one of the useful functions that Mr. Garner's retelling of these stories serves is to show that once removed from their historic context--no matter how sexist, racist, speciesist, etc. that context may have been--they lose much of their meaning and the lessons they taught to generations of us get lost in the translation.  Political correctness very much resembles those new clothes, embarrassingly transparent and ultimately useless.<br />Mr. Garner's book is not a particularly profound satire of political correctness, for that we recommend Postmodern Pooh (2001) (Frederick Crews  1933-)  (Grade: A), but it is enjoyable and by its accessibility and popularity has proven quite important.  In demonstrating how silly political correctness is he helped to turn it from a frightening trend into an object of derision.  The greatest threat to an idea comes not when people disagree with it, but when they laugh at it.  With Mr. Garner's help, political correctness has become a laughingstock.

In fact, it seems not too much of a stretch to say that the prose and story-telling styles of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler were as influential, or more so, than those of any of the more high-toned literary icons of the 20th Century, with the added distinction that folks who tried to like them actually produced readable books, while those who tried to write like Joyce, Woolf, and Faulkner generally produced drek.<br />Strangely enough though, two of the best current practitioners in these genres are Australian.  The Cliff Hardy series by Peter Corris is among the select company of great homages to Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, while the Wyatt novels by Garry Disher are probably the best crime series since Donald Westlake's Parker books (written under the pseudonym of Richard Stark) of thirty and forty years ago.  From the one word name of the antihero to the problems with the \\"Outfit\\" (organized crime), the Wyatt stories actually quite resemble Westlake's.<br />Here's Disher's description of his protagonist :<br />  Wyatt was forty years old.  Respectable men his age were marking time until their retirement.  The hard men his age were dead or in gaol.<br />  Wyatt was different.  He'd never been burdened by doubt, uncertainty or personal ties.  He worked from an emotionless base.  He could<br />  cut to the essentials of a job and stamp his cold hard style on it.<br />He needs to be cold and hard in this, his second, caper, as he's being hunted by the Outfit after crossing them up in the first book; he's trying to pull a payroll job in the unfamiliar surroundings of Belcowie, three hours north of Adelaide; and he's got untested partners, including a woman, violating one of his own rules.<br />The language is terse, the action brisk and brutal, and the book terrific.  Cover blurbs for such novels always refer to them as realistic.  I suspect the opposite is actually true.  Thankfully there aren't many criminals as smart and emotionless as Wyatt, otherwise we'd all be in trouble.<br />GRADE : Arific.  Cover blurbs for such novels always refer to them as realistic.

It was something he'd thought about since he took up boxing in his twenties, mostly as a way to stay in shape, but with the chance to pursue a dream slipping away, he finally went for it. He even signed on with a tough but talented trainer, Milton LaCroix, a man with a reputation for being difficult to work with--he's apparently alienated everyone involved in New York's boxing world--but also a reputation for turning out good, though unorthodox, fighters.<br />Mr. Anasi's chronicle, which combines elements of George Plimpton style participatory sportswriting with in-depth reportage, nicely captures both the qualities that make boxing alluring--the colorful cast of characters; the dedication required; the physical challenge; the savage beauty of a punch well thrown and a fight well<br />fought; there's even an amusingly heartfelt paean to sweat--and those that make it repulsive--the genuine danger of injury; the exploitation of fighters by greedy managers and promoters; the serious questions that surround even the judging of an amateur bout and the draw for a tournament bracket. As in all the best of such accounts, he succeeds in capturing this dying subculture in its entirety, warts and all, while conveying his obvious love for it.<br />He tells the stories of the people he meets along the way with great sympathy but also with brutal honesty, a combination that might only be possible from a Sarah Lawrence graduate who's also fought enough to begin experiencing neurological effects--memory loss. Mr. Anasi subjects himself to the same tough but fair treatment as he seeks to understand his own obsession and what seems to have been a final bout victory but ended up a loss. In the end he concludes that for all the problems that attend boxing, there is something uniquely worthwhile that occurs within the ring itself, a meeting of one man with another on terms of complete equality, a meeting that though it ends in victory for only one, ends in mutual respect between the two.<br />If you're a boxing fan, or used to be, you'll certainly love the book. If you hate boxing you'll find much here to justify your hatred. If you've never understood the attraction of the sport you will after reading it. Most of all, if you like good storytelling, superior cultural reporting, and quality writing, you'll find them all here, and you'll enjoy them even if you don't care about boxing.

With the possible exception of Parson Weem's tales of<br />young George Washington, the stories of Washington Irving, and a few tall tales like Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, and John Henry, the best might be found in Stephen<br />Vincent Benet's Faust-influenced but distinctly American short story and screenplay, The Devil and Daniel Webster, which has also been adapted for the stage and<br />turned into an opera.<br />Jabez Stone of Cross Corners, New Hampshire is a man of little luck, until, with his wife and children ill and a whitlow on his own thumb, he barks :<br />  I vow it's enough to make a man want to sell his soul to the devill And I would, too, for two cents!<br />With that, a stranger appears and Jabez makes a deal, signing it in blood, which changes his luck drastically.<br />Over the next ten years, Stone prospers, becoming wealthy and an important man in politics.  But with his mortgage to the stranger coming due, Jabez Stone regrets<br />the deal he's made and pays a visit to his neighbor, Daniel Webster, of Mansfield, NH--the nation's greatest lawyer and New England's most revered citizen--to see<br />if Mr. Webster will take him on as a client and see if there's not some way out of the deal.  A lesser man might balk at the prospect of such a fight, but Daniel<br />Webster has a special regard for his constituents and cheerfully assures Jabez that they'll prevail :<br />  For if two New Hampshiremen aren't a match for the devil, we might as well give the country back to the Indians.<br />Webster's first ploy is to challenge the stranger's right to prey upon Americans :<br />  'Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince. We fought England for that<br />  in ë12 and we&iacute;ll fight all hell for it again!'<br />  'Foreign?' said the stranger. 'And who calls me a foreigner?'<br />  'Well, I never yet heard of the dev -- of your claiming American citizenship,' said Dan'l Webster with surprise.<br />  'And who with better right?' said the stranger, with one of his terrible smiles. 'When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there.<br />  When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on her deck. Am I not in your books and stories and beliefs, from the first settlements on?<br />  Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner,<br />  but I am neither. I am merely an honest American like yourself--and of the best descent--for, to tell the truth, Mr. Webster,<br />  though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in this country than yours.'<br />This prompts Webster to recourse to Stone's rights as an American :<br />  'Aha!' said Dan'l Webster, with the veins standing out in his forehead. 'Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client!'<br />  'The case is hardly one for an ordinary court,' said the stranger, his eyes flickering. 'And, indeed, the lateness of the hour-'<br />  'Let it be any court you choose, so it is an American judge and an American jury!' said Dan'l Webster in his pride.<br />  'Let it be the quick or the dead; I'll abide the issue!'<br />And so begins a trial, presided over by Justice Hathorne, who likewise oversaw the Salem Witch Trials, with a jury made up of the likes of Walter Butler, Simon<br />Girty, King Philip, Reverend John Smeet, and Morton of Merry Mount.  Inevitably, even these dastards are swayed by the rhetorical power of Daniel Webster and<br />Jabez is released from his contract.  The stranger good-naturedly conceding :<br />  'Perhaps 'tis not strictly in accordance with the evidence,' he said, 'but even the damned may salute the eloquence of Mr. Webster.'<br />Despite this graciousness, Daniel Webster grabs and threatens him, but then relents to his pleading.  In exchange forbeing let go, the stranger predicts Webster's<br />future for him.  The stranger well knows of Webster's desire to be president one day and of his pride in his speaking ability.  He warns that the dream will never come<br />true and, perversely, the ambition will be thwarted by Webster's own talent :<br />  '[T]he last great speech you make will turn many of your own against you,' said the stranger.  'They will call you Ichabod; they will call you<br />  by other names. Even in New England some will say you have turned your coat and sold your country, and their voices will be loud against<br />  you till you die.'<br />Webster takes the news surpassing well and in turn receives an assurance :<br />  'So it is an honest speech, it does not matter what men say,' said Dan'l Webster. Then he looked at the stranger and their glances locked.<br />  'One question,' he said. 'I have fought for the Union all my life. Will I see that fight won against those who would tear it apart?'<br />  'Not while you live,' said the stranger, grimly, 'but it will be won. And after you are dead, there are thousands who will fight for your cause,<br />  because of words that you spoke.\\"<br />  'Why, then, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern-jawed, fortune-telling note shaver!' said Dan'l Webster, with a great roar of laughter,<br />  'be off with you to your own place before I put my mark on you! For, by the thirteen original colonies, I'd go to the Pit itself to save the Union!'<br />Sure enough, Webster's great speech in favor of the Missouri Compromise in 1850 would ensure its passage but with its provision for admitting a new slave state to<br />the Union would make him anathema to hardcore abolitionists and doom his presidential hopes.<br />Benet helped adapt this story for the screen and it made for one of the really underrated great American films.  With sterling performances by Edward Arnold as<br />Webster and Walter Huston as the stranger, here called Mr. Scratch, the middle portion of the story, detailing Jabez Stone's rising fortunes and declining character,<br />is greatly expanded.  This is problematic because James Craig as Jabez is pretty nondescript, but Jane Darwell as his mother and Simone Simon as a sultry vixen who<br />becomes the Stone's housemaid help to carry us through until the trial starts.<br />One interesting aspect of Benet's tale is his refusal to let his countrymen off the hook; the Devil is obviously integral to the American experience and though Webster<br />matches the Devil in the end, he too hears the siren call of Mr. Scratch.  In the end though Webster is redeemed by his all consuming love of the nation :<br />  And they say that if you go to his grave and speak loud and clear, 'Dan'l Webster--Dan'l Webster!' the ground'll begin to shiver and the trees<br />  begin to shake.  And after a while you'll hear a deep voice saying. 'Neighbor, how stands the Union?'

But many of the best writers on the Right once wrote in its pages, among them P. J. O'Rourke.  Mr. O'Rourke is one of<br />those writers who entertains us often enough that he can be forgiven for cashing in once in awhile, which is fortunate, because this is only barely a book.  It starts with<br />a very funny column, A Call for a New McCarthyism (American Spectator, July 1989), in which he calls for a new blacklist.  Unlike the McCarthy era list though :<br />\\"The distinguishing feature of this cluster of dunces is not subversion but silliness.\\"  And rather than barring these dunces from working and trying to hush up their<br />views, he has the more diabolical idea of exposing them and their ideas to the harsh light of day :<br />  [T]he worst punishment for dupes, pink-wieners, and dialectical immaterialists might be a kind of reverse blacklist.  We don't prevent them<br />  from writing, speaking, performing, and otherwise being their usual nuisance selves.  Instead, we hang on their every word, beg them<br />  to work, drag them onto all available TV and radio chat shows, and write hundreds of fawning newspaper and magazine articles about their<br />  wonderful swellness.  In other words, we subject them to the monstrous, gross, and irreversible late-twentieth-century phenomenon of Media<br />  Overexposure so that a surfeited public rebels in disgust.  This is the 'Pia Zadora Treatment,' and, for condemning people to obscurity, it beats<br />  the Smith Act hollow.<br />That's pretty funny stuff, but then you read the list and realize that almost all of the folks on it--Gore Vidal, Tom Hayden, Angela Davis, Amy Carter, Susan<br />Sarandon, Mike Farrell, Tikkun, Garry Trudeau, the Sheen brothers, etc.--faded into obscurity on their own; they were so awful they weren't even worthy enemies.<br />Unfortunately though, this initial essay was followed by six more installments (the last in November 1993) and some of these consist of nothing more than<br />nominations from readers and Mr. O'Rourke's comments on their nominations.  It all gets pretty tiresome.<br />But then just as you're ready to toss the book on the trash heap, it's redeemed by two final pieces that were seemingly tacked on at the end just to flesh the book out to<br />150 pages.  The first, 100 Reasons Jimmy Carter Was a Better President Than Bill Clinton (American Spectator, September 1993), is very funny.  The second, Why I<br />Am a Conservative in the First Place (Rolling Stone, July 13-27, 1995), is not only amusing but also presents as good a defense of conservatism as you'll find<br />anywhere these days.  In light of its title and the gist of the piece, it almost has to be read as a response to F. A. Hayek's famous libertarian essay, Why I Am Not a<br />Conservative.  Hayek, who seems to have understand American conservatism not at all, wrote :<br />  Let me now state what seems to me the decisive objection to any conservatism which deserves to be called such. It is that by its very nature<br />  it cannot offer an alternative to the direction in which we are moving. It may succeed by its resistance to current tendencies in slowing down<br />  undesirable developments, but, since it does not indicate another direction, it cannot prevent their continuance. It has, for this reason, invariably<br />  been the fate of conservatism to be dragged along a path not of its own choosing. The tug of war between conservatives and progressives<br />  can only affect the speed, not the direction, of contemporary developments. But, though there is a need for a \\"brake on the vehicle of progress,\\"<br />  I personally cannot be content with simply helping to apply the brake. What the liberal must ask, first of all, is not how fast or how far<br />  we should move, but where we should move. In fact, he differs much more from the collectivist radical of today than does the conservative.<br />  While the last generally holds merely a mild and moderate version of the prejudices of his time, the liberal today must more positively oppose<br />  some of the basic conceptions which most conservatives share with the socialists.<br />Mr. O'Rourke on the other hand, though often characterized as a libertarian, accepts the conservative label and his definition of conservatism :<br />  The purpose of conservative politics is to defend the liberty of the individual and--lest individualism run riot--insist upon individual responsibility.<br />contains the all important corollary to liberty, that the price of our freedom must be that we each take responsibility for ourselves.  Libertarianism's major fault is<br />that it insists on the former but refuses the latter.<br />On balance, the first and then the last two pieces make the collection marginally worthwhile.  And Mr. O'Rourke does have to earn a living, so we'll not begrudge<br />too much the filler in between.<br />GRADE : B-t where we should move.

George too has his own series now, on PBS, and a spanking new<br />reprint of his original adventure.<br />The story here is fairly basic : George, suddenly three inches small, follows the instructions his parents left behind in a note, to clean up the house and watch his little<br />brother (now a BIG little brother).  Along the way he avoids an ornery house cat and rides in a toy plane.  Our kids favorite page features George scrubbing dirty<br />dishes by skiing down them on a sponge.<br />As with Rolie Polie Olie though, the story is secondary to Mr. Joyce's remarkable artwork.  In Olie he manages to combine Art Deco with Futurism; here it's all<br />throwback.  George Shrinks looks like a really hip version of the Dick and Jane books.

In<br />the story of a young backpacker in Southeast Asia, who finds a kind of utopian commune on an island beach off the coast of Thailand, Garland seems<br />to be quite consciously summoning everything from Lord of the Flies to Gilligan's Island.  And he explicitly invokes The Heart of Darkness,<br />Apocalypse Now, Platoon, etc., and a wide range of video games with which I'm not familiar.  The result is a book that's achingly aware of where it's<br />coming from, but teases us by wandering down the paths of its various sources only to end up in dead-ends.  So, when we finally do get where we're<br />going we feel a tad ill-used.<br />The book begins with our putative protagonist, Richard, in Bangkok, where a bungalow mate tells him how to find the island and then commits<br />suicide.  Richard and a French couple set out to find the much-rumored beach and, after some reasonably exciting difficulties, do so.  The denizens<br />don't seem to have much of a philosophy or a sense of mission; they're content just to have found a beach that other tourists haven't \\"ruined\\".  Their<br />days are spent in fishing, gathering food, and performing a variety of other mundane tasks just aimed at keeping their community going.  They divert<br />themselves with a few sports contests, a Gameboy, and a lot of dope, illicitly obtained from a local field that is the domain of a scary group of armed<br />men, with whom they have an implicit non-interference agreement.<br />Over the course of the novel the tension begins to rise within the community and between the beach dwellers and the dope growers.  Richard fears<br />that a couple fellow travelers with whom he shared the story of the beach may show up and get him in trouble with his reclusive comrades.  And we<br />gradually realize that Richard is a rather unreliable narrator, as his drug use, which requires ever bolder incursions on the drug fields, and his<br />imaginary conversations with the dead guy who told him about the beach start to obscure reality.  Even more startling is the way in which he seems to<br />want to create his own version of the Vietnam experience on the island.  He's itching for trouble and we're pretty sure he's eventually going to find it.<br />The book maintains a compelling atmosphere of dread and Mr. Garland is an effective story-teller, but there's a sort of dissatisfying hollowness to the<br />whole affair.  The dialogue is almost entirely pointless and that seems to be the author's intent.  The islanders lack of any meaningful goals makes<br />their group seem temporary almost by definition, so we're never emotionally invested in its survival.  We know that as soon as they're found the group<br />will collapse, because the beach won't be \\"cool\\" anymore.  Meanwhile, their coolness is an inadequate hook for our rooting interest.  Worst of all,<br />because they don't believe in anything interesting, other than a kind of dubious communal ethos, and because they have nothing interesting to say, it's<br />not apparent that Mr. Garland even wants us to care that they and their Beach are doomed.  In fact, there's guilty pleasure to be had in watching it all<br />come a cropper.<br />It's not a bad book, and I can accept that Mr. Garland's message may be that this generation of young people lead lives that are so devoid of purpose<br />that they have to live vicariously through cultural reference to other people's experiences, that the highest aspirations of his generation, their visions of<br />Utopia, amount to nothing more than an unlimited supply of pot and an undiscovered beach on which to smoke it and play Tetris.  But if that's all this<br />was about, it seems like he could have conveyed that message more quickly.

Karl, is every bit as lyrical and well written as Complications and in some ways, both because he is more experienced as a doctor and because of his<br />unusual experiences as a patient, is more compelling.<br />The similarities and differences between the two books are both instructive.  Mr. Gawande is just finishing his surgery residency in Boston, but is already regularly<br />published in Slate and The New Yorker.  Richard Karl is the Chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of South Florida College of Medicine and has<br />a couple of decades as a surgeon under his belt.  His writing career (non-technical writing that is) began almost accidentally, when Eugene C. Patterson, editor<br />emeritus of the St. Petersburg Times, prevailed upon him to write down some of the stories he enjoyed telling about what went on \\"across the red line\\", the line that<br />separates patient and surgical team from the rest of the hospital and family and friends.  At least one of the essays here has previously appeared in that paper  and<br />hopefully this book will earn him the wider audience he richly deserves.<br />As in Mr. Gawande's book, one of the best pieces in this collection concerns the ritual of the Morbidity and Mortality Conference, where a doctor presents the details<br />of a problematic case and his colleagues proceed to grill him on what he might have done differently, kind of a medical version of Prime Minister's Question Time.<br />Both men are justifiably proud of this tradition, with its emphasis on physicians holding each other accountable and correcting deficiencies in timely fashion.<br />Because Dr. Karl is a teacher, he presents the process of training new surgeons from the opposite perspective that Mr. Gawande gave us.  Here we see the mentor<br />trying to encourage his charges while at the same time keeping them focussed and humble.  In one essay he deals with the high drama of Match Day, when students<br />across the country find out what training program they have matched with and where they are headed for their residency.  It's interesting to see how this<br />emotionally draining event  impacts someone whose been through it himself and now has a roting interest where his own students and the incoming residents are<br />concerned.<br />The most revealing pieces in the book though come when Dr. Karl describes his own encounters with the medical system from the patient's side of the table.  In his<br />first year as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago, the doctor received a needle prick and developed hepatitis.  This gave him an appreciation for the<br />fear that a patient feels (particularly when a somewhat brusque older doctor casually told him, \\"The last surgeon I treated for hepatitis, died.\\") and for how precious<br />his own life is and how important it is to keep such things in perspective.  Years later, after wrestling an unruly patient to the floor, he developed a pain between his<br />shoulders, which eventually turned out to be a broken neck.  But in the meantime he endured misdiagnosis, inappropriate humor, the terrifying trauma of an MRI,<br />the strange sensation of having his name in the patient's spot instead of the doctor's on his hospital wristband, what seems to have been a fairly sketchy surgery, and<br />some very unsatisfactory results.  Most of all, there was one moment where a lack of eye contact, the inability to consult with one of his original doctors, came to<br />symbolize for him the reason why patients sue.<br />Dr. Karl is extraordinarily open and honest with the reader throughout these essays, from a moving tribute to his father that captures the strange ambivalence of<br />many sons toward their dads, to a story about guiding a family away from prolonging a patient's life where he wonders if he may have overstepped ethical<br />boundaries.  On this last, I personally think the answer may be, yes he did, but it also seems, from the seriousness with which he approached the situation and the<br />straightforwardness with which he relates the details, that he deserves the benefit of the doubt.  Let's put it this way, after reading this fine book, even if I'd disagree<br />with Dr. Karl on a few specific issues, I'd be honored and pleased to be under his care and I look forward to reading more of his essays in the future.<br />GRADE : A-ness with which he approached the situation and the<BR>straightforwardness with which he relates the details, that he deserves the benefit of the doubt.

In 1290, the good king Rudolph <BR>has died; leader of Germany, Austria, and the cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Underwalden, he collected taxes yearly but otherwise left the stubborn and <BR>independent mountain people of Uri alone.  But his son Albrecht rules with a harder hand, and his deputy, Gessler, who is building a permanent castle <BR>at Altdorf, is particularly despised.  William Tell is part of a group, eleven men from each canton, who plan to revolt in 1291, but events get ahead of <BR>him when he and Walter travel to Altdorf.  There, Gessler's henchmen have placed a nobleman's feathered cap upon a tall pole and require the men of <BR>Uri to bow to it, which William refuses to do, setting in motion the train of events that bring honor to his name even seven hundred years later.<br />This is a thrilling story of \\"one man's revolt against tyranny\\", with serious themes of independence and freedom and responsibility.

The comics were written by  Ren Goscinny until his death in<br />1977 and drawn by Albert Uderzo, who also writes the stories now.  They concern the plucky Asterix the Gaul, who though diminutive can gain great<br />strength by quaffing a magic potion whipped up by the village druid Magicimix, and his faithful side-kick, Obelix, a behemoth made abnormally<br />strong when he was dunked in the potion as a child.  The year is 50 B.C., the time of Vercingetorix, the great rebel leader of the Gauls, who<br />eventually lost to the Romans at the Battle of Alesia.  Asterix and Obelix though live in a small corner of Gaul that continues to hold out against<br />Caesar and Rome.<br />The various adventures have a reassuring sameness, with our heroes outwitting the Romans as they travel throughout Europe (seemingly a sales<br />tactic--with the duo even being sent to what would later be the New World at one point in an attempt to foster their abysmal U. S. sales).  The main<br />source of humor in the books comes in the form of puns, mostly characters' names : Malacoustix the Bard; Macroeconomix, chief of the tribe; etc.<br />The original stories apparently contain somewhat barbed commentary about French politics, but the translations don't even bother trying to replicate<br />it.  The comic is also famed for visual jokes such as the one that appears in this issue, when the pirates who are being sunk (a continuing in-joke) are<br />posed to resemble Gricault's Raft of the Medusa.<br />But the adventures aren't exciting enough, the artwork good enough, nor the humor witty enough to explain what a phenomenon the series became.<br />And apparently many folks have tried figuring out exactly why it is so popular; it's even a serious topic in French academia (to the extent that there is<br />such a thing).  I've no better explanation than anyone else, but suspect two things are at work : first, the paucity of heroes in French literature; second,<br />that the idea of valiant Frenchmen holding out against an evil empire appeals to folk who failed to do so against the Nazis and imagine themselves to<br />be making up for it against America.  As to the first point, it seems significant that there aren't really other French comic book heroes and that when it<br />came time to make French movies about crime fighters, whether private detectives or cops, filmmakers relied heavily on the conventions of American<br />movies.  As for the latter, one would merely note that McDonald's doesn't use Ronald as its mascot in France, but Asterix instead.<br />One kid in our neighborhood used to love these things when we were growing up, and we'd all read them.  Looking at one now, as an adult, I'm<br />genuinely unimpressed.  It's interesting as a curiosity more than anything else, but, like the French love of Jerry Lewis, its hard to see what all the<br />fuss is about.<br />GRADE : Ch academia (to the extent that there is <BR>such a thing).

As a surgeon writing essays about his profession for the general public, he follows in the footsteps of Richard Selzer, who has been writing wonderfully about the complexities and oddities of surgery for several decades. And writing in the pages of The New Yorker, he follows in the tradition of the great Berton Roueche, whose \\"Narratives of Medical Detection\\" are among the best pieces ever to appear in the magazine. Perhaps wisely, Dr. Gawande neither tries to be as lyrical as Dr. Selzer nor to plumb the mysteries and the adventure of medical investigation as did Roueche. Instead he offers us an entree to the world of the physician in training and tries to be scrupulously fair in his treatment of the various and often competing concerns of doctors, patients, ethicists, insurers, etc. He's generous in sharing his own experiences and discussing his mistakes and the essays are often interesting, but they are somehow antiseptic and less engaging than they might be if he took firmer positions on the issues or at least revealed more of his own opinions and prejudices.<br />Dr. Gawande writes that :<br />Medicine is, I have found, a strange and in many ways disturbing business. The stakes are high, the liberties taken tremendous. We drug people,  put needles and tubes into them, manipulate their chemistry, biology, and physics, lay them unconscious and open their bodies up to the world.  We do so out of an abiding confidence in our know-how as a profession. What you find when you get in close, however-close enough to see  the furrowed brows, the doubts and missteps, the failures as well as the successes -- is how messy, uncertain, and also surprising medicine turns  out to be.<br />He's at his best when he's leading the reader through the mess. From doctors with psychological problems to the vagaries of diagnosis to the strange, but surely coincidental, occurrences of a Friday the 13th with a full moon, he shows us that for all the advances in medicine in recent years, there is still much we don't understand and a stubborn persistence of quite alarming human error. He's less good in essays like the one on the decline of autopsies (which happens to be on-line) when he strives so hard to take a blanced and empathetic approach that he borders on abandoning medical judgment.<br />The book is definitely worth reading and I'll be keeping an eye out for his essays. I suspect, and hope, that his best work lies in front of him and that as he gains experience and confidence he'll be willing to give his writing a little harder edge. Hopefully he can do that without losing his welcome humility, rare enough in doctors in general but almost unheard of in a surgeon.of a Friday the 13th with a full moon, he shows us that for all the advances in medicine in recent years, there is still much we don't understand and a stubborn persistence of quite alarming human error.

And there is no way to tell it. The art of fiction is dead. Reality has strangled invention. Only the utterly<br />  impossible, the inexpressibly fantastic, can ever be plausible again.<br />  -Last Chapter (October 4, 1951)<br />That is perhaps the most famous opening of any column in the history of journalism, and deservedly so.  In fact, as you read this extraordinarily fine<br />collection of Red Smith's baseball writings, it is remarkable to realize just how many of his lines and phrases you recognize.  Of course, when Smith<br />was a sportswriter, the sports page often contained the best writing in the paper.  Today our image of journalists is absurdly inflated by Watergate and<br />the generation it inspired, but watch a movie from the '30s or 40s (say The Front Page) and you'll see just how low was the esteem they were held in.<br />But the sports guys had plum jobs so the position attracted truly talented men, from Damon Runyan to Ring Lardner to Paul Gallico to Smith himself.<br />Through some happy confluence of the stars Smith wrote for The New York Herald Tribune during the period when New York City not only had<br />three baseball teams but three very good baseball Writing on deadline teams : the 1940s and 50s versions of the Yankees; Dodgers; and Giants.  This<br />book, though it covers other decades too, draws heavily from this period, which has not suffered from inattention over the years, but it is Smith's<br />descriptions of what happened (as with the opening line above) that remain in our minds.  Here's another of my favorites, written on October 4, 1947,<br />after Cookie Lavagetto and the Dodgers had broken up a Floyd Bevens no-hitter to beat the Yankees and win the World Series :<br />  The unhappiest man in Brooklyn is sitting up here in the far end of the press box.  The 'V' on his typewriter is broken.  He can't write either<br />  Lavagetto or Bevens.<br />Even writing on a daily deadline, Smith managed to toss off great lines like that in nearly every column.

The book, which was originally serialized in the<br />Saturday Evening Post from December 1954 to January 1955 as The Day New York Was Invaded, is no longer in print--despite the fact that the<br />tattered copy I'm holding is something like the 30th printing.  And the film does not seem to have been transferred to DVD, though I did find a copy<br />of the equally funny sequel, The Mouse on the Moon.  Our growing amnesia is unfortunate, both because this is just a funny story, and also because<br />current events reveal it to still be timely.<br />The tale concerns the Duchy of Grand Fenwick, a tiny European nation which \\"lies in a precipitous fold of the northern Alps.\\"  It was founded in<br />1370 by British soldier of fortune Roger Fenwick, under not altogether honorable circumstances.  Practically the only thing that is produced there,<br />and the only reason anyone has ever heard of it, is a fine wine called Pinot Grand Fenwick.  Other than this one export, the nation remains happily<br />isolated, a medieval remnant in the modern world, ruled over by Duchess Gloriana XII--\\"a pretty girl of twenty-two\\" in the book, a more matronly<br />woman in the film, so that Peter Sellers can play her--and her prime minister, the Count of Mountjoy (also played by Peter Sellers).<br />As the story begins, crisis has descended upon the Grand Duchy in the form of revenue shortfalls.  It is determined that the most effective way of<br />raising money is to declare war on the United States, the pretext for which is the introduction of a San Rafael, California winery of a wine called<br />Pinot Grand Enwick, a provocation that can not be allowed to stand.  As Gloriana explains the aims of the war :<br />  All in all, as I said before, there is no more profitable and sound step for a nation without money or credit to take, than declare war<br />  on the United States and suffer a total defeat.<br />It's easy to see why the fortunes of this story changed over the years; written just a few years after the Marshall Plan, it resonated in an America that<br />had won WWII and rebuilt its enemies.  But in the late 60s and early 70s, the Left determined that America was evil and that there was nothing<br />honorable nor humorous about the Cold War, Vietnam, or any of the other seemingly benign extensions of American power.  Wibberley's witty<br />insight must have seemed the stuff of delusions or insidious propaganda to folks who had convinced themselves that we were really an imperialist<br />nation.  But now that the \\"blame America first\\" crowd has been routed, you can read that speech above, or watch the movie, and hear the eerie<br />echoes coming from Afghanistan.  What might Mr. Wibberley have made of the absurd notion that at the same we were bombing the Taliban and Al<br />Qaeda we were bombing the rest of the Afghanis with food supplies?  And the rest of the war has played out exactly as the Duchess Gloriana would<br />have predicted--the Taliban had no sooner been routed than we started pouring in money and rebuilding that broken nation.  You could read through<br />thousands of pages of anti-American screeds by Noam Chomsky, Susan Sontag, Barbara Kingsolver, and their ilk, without increasing your<br />understanding of the world by one iota.  But in that one speech, Leonard Wibberley basically explains the entire 20th (or American) Century.<br />At any rate, Tully Bascombe, chief forest ranger ofthe Duchy (again played by Sellers in the film), and twenty longbowmen charter a boat and<br />invade Manhattan, intending to surrender as quickly as possible.  But by happy coincidence, the whole city is underground for an air raid test, and<br />when first Tully and his chain mail clad \\"army\\" are mistaken for aliens and then they capture a scientist, Dr. Kokintz, and his super-lethal quadium<br />(or Q) bomb, Grand Fenwick ends up winning the war.  Armed with the Q bomb, Fenwick forms a League of Little Nations and dictates its own<br />peace terms and blackmails the U.S. and Russia into a general nuclear disarmament.<br />Tully, hero of Fenwick's great victory, of course gets the girl--Dr. Kokintz's daughter in the film; the Duchess herself in the novel.  This gives Mr.<br />Wibberley one last opportunity for a very amusing, though thoroughly politically incorrect, observation, as Mountjoy tries to convince the Duchess<br />that she must take a husband :<br />  'I hope,' said Gloriana warily, 'that you are not going to suggest that I marry the American minister because I won't do it.<br />  I've been reading about the Americans in a women's magazine and they're all cruel to their wives,'<br />  'Cruel to their wives?' echoed the count.<br />  'Precisely.  They treat them as equals.  They refuse to make any decisions without consulting them.  They load them up with<br />  worries they should keep to themselves.  And when there isn't enough money, they send them out to work instead of earning<br />  more by their own efforts.  Some of them even make their wives work so they can go to college.  They are not men at all.<br />  They are men-women.  And their wives are women-men.  If I am to marry, I want a husband who will be a man and let me<br />  be a woman.  I'll be able to handle him better that way.'<br />Of course, the ultimate truth of this sharp observation lies in the final line, Gloriana's certainty that theoretical \\"equality\\" is unnecessary for her to<br />actually control a husband.<br />Both book and movie are a great deal of fun.  They are well worth seeking out.  That their satire is once again applicable to the events of the day<br />should be reason enough for a revival.<br />GRADE : A(again played by Sellers in the film), and twenty longbowmen charter a boat and <BR>invade Manhattan, intending to surrender as quickly as possible.

From D. H. Lawrence to<br />Richard Llewellyn to The Deer Hunter to Homer Hickam, writers have celebrated escaping from mining country, but they've mostly (Lawrence being<br />the exception who proves the rule) looked back with some fondness.  David Drayer's first novel is told in much the fashion of Sherwood Anderson's<br />Winesburg, Ohio, as a set of interconnected but not necessarily continuous stories.  Here they are unified in that they trace the progress of Seth<br />Hardy, thirteen when we meet him, a man when he leaves town at the end of the book.  The town is Cherry Run, Pennsylvania.  The strip cuts of the<br />title are the remnants of the region's mining history.<br />Seth is a likable enough protagonist, undergoing the familiar torments of an awkward boy, with an unfortunate nickname, amongst high school<br />bullies.  His particular nemesis is the loathsome Claude Coarsen.  In a scene that provides a visceral thrill to anyone who's ever been bullied and that<br />offers a kind of insight into how kids might end up shooting up their schools, Seth draws a bead on Coarsen when they are both out hunting deer.<br />But in this case, Seth doesn't shoot.  Equally compelling is a scene between Seth and the pretty young teacher who is one of his biggest supporters.<br />She ponders what would be so wrong about reaching out to this unhappy young man, yet has the good sense to control herself.  And in many ways it<br />is Seth's father, Earl, who resides at the core of the book, a decent though reserved man who is capable of being just as strict with his son's high<br />school principal as he is with the boy and who proves a soft touch for a couple who are down on their luck.<br />This is an impressive debut, perhaps most impressive for Mr. Drayer's allegiance to his own material.  He apparently resisted editors' attempts to strip<br />out secondary characters and he wisely avoided what must be a powerful temptation for any writer today, eschewing the annoyingly popular memoir<br />form and sticking with a novel.

But if he indulges his delusion that he can write poetry, he gets to<br />live a bohemian life of chic poverty, easy morality, and reflexive socialism.  Admitting he's really meant to write advertising jingles would require<br />him to settle into a respectable, but dreaded, middle class existence of comfort, family, and an aspidistra in the window.  The horror, the horror....<br />You can judge who the three most important writers of the last three centuries were by the attempts of both Left and Right to co-opt them and claim<br />them as their own : Adam Smith (18th Century); Alexis de Tocqueville (19th Century); and George Orwell (20th Century).  With the exception of<br />people telling me I'm swinish for not thinking that James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, and the James brothers (Henry and William) are geniuses, I'd<br />guess that no topic has generated more hostile email to Brothers Judd than our classifying Orwell as a conservative.  These hostile correspondents<br />though never offer any more evidence than the mere fact that Orwell called himself a socialist and fought against Franco in the Spanish Civil War.<br />It goes almost without saying that they don't refer to his writings, because it is there that their argument falls apart.  Nowhere is this more evident<br />than in the semi-autobiographical--indeed, Orwell later thought it overly autobiographical--Keep the Aspidistra Flying.<br />The title of the book is awkward and maybe even off-putting, but necessary.  Meanwhile, the filmmakers chose an equally appropriate, but<br />misleading title, for Gordon Comstock is at war on two fronts.  The first is with his long-suffering girlfriend, Rosemary, who he hopes to coerce<br />into bed without marrying :<br />  Each laughed with delight at the other's absurdities. There was a merry war between them.<br />The second front is Gordon's war against the money god :<br />  What he realised, and more clearly as time went on, was that money-worship has been elevated into a religion.  Perhaps it is the only<br />  real religion--the only really felt religion--that is left to us.  Money is what God used to be.  Good and evil have no meaning any longer<br />  except failure and success.  Hence the profoundly significant phrase, to make good.  The decalogue has been reduced to two<br />  commandments.  One for the employers--the elect, the money-priesthood as it were--'Thou shalt make money'; the other for the<br />  employed--the slaves and underlings--'Thou shalt not lose thy job.'  It was about this time that he came across The Ragged Trousered<br />  Philanthropists and read about the starving carpenter who pawns everything but sticks to his aspidistra.  The aspidistra, flower of England!<br />  It ought to be on our coat of arms instead of the lion and the unicorn.  There will be no revolution in England while there are aspidistras<br />  in windows.<br />By God!  That sounds like a ringing enough call to arms doesn't it?  Except, that is, for the inconvenient title of the novel : Keep the Aspidistra<br />Flying.  This story, like nearly all of Orwell's, is anti-revolutionary and possessed of both a deep love of middle-class England and a good-natured<br />contempt for wealthy socialists (like Comstock's publisher, Ravelston) and all of those (like Gordon himself) who romanticize poverty and the<br />poor.  And so, when Gordon, who by then has been reduced to rather dire straits, finally abandons his life of destitution and the half-written book<br />of inane poems that he'd been writing to resume his advertising job and marry Rosemary, who he's gotten in the family way, it is in no wise a<br />defeat, but a triumph :<br />  Now that the thing was done he felt nothing but relief; relief that now at last he had finished with dirt, cold, hunger and loneliness and could get<br />back to decent, fully human life.  His resolutions, now that he had broken them, seemed nothing but a frightful weight that he had cast off.<br />Moreover, he was aware that he was only fulfilling his destiny.  In some corner of his mind he had always known that this would happen.  He<br />thought of the day when he had given them notice at New Albion; and Mr. Erskine's kind, red, beefish face, gently counselling him not to chuck up<br />a 'good' job for nothing.  How bitterly he had sworn, then, that he was done with 'good' jobs for ever!  Yet it was foredoomed that he should come<br />back, and he had known it even then.  And it was not merely because of Rosemary and the baby that he had done it.  That was the obvious cause,<br />the precipitating cause, but even without it the end would have been the same ; if there had been no baby to think about, something else would have<br />forced his hand.  For it was what, in his secret heart, he had desired.<br />And if that doesn't convince you that the story represents a whole-hearted embrace of bourgeois existence, try this :<br />  Our civilization is founded on greed and fear, but in the lives of common men the greed and fear are mysteriously transmuted into<br />  something nobler.  The lower-middle-class people in there, behind their lace curtains, with their children and their scraps of furniture<br />  and their aspidistras--they lived by the money-code, sure enough, and yet they contrived to keep their decency.  The money-code as they<br />  interpreted it was not merely cynical and hoggish.  They had their standards, their inviolable points of honour.  They 'kept themselves<br />  respectable'--kept the aspidistra flying.  Besides, they were alive.  They were bound up in the bundle of life.  They begot children,<br />  which is what the saints and the soul-savers never by any chance do.<br /><br />  The aspidistra is the tree of life, he thought suddenly.<br />Orwell offers up this wisdom with a light touch.  He also has the characteristically brutal honesty to portray Comstock (his younger self) as quite a<br />horse's arse during his bohemian phase.  This comes through even more clearly in the film, where Comstock (as played by Richard E. Grant) is<br />nearly difficult to like, prior to his epiphany.  It is only when he accepts his own responsibility for the life growing in Rosemary that he comes to be<br />\\"fully human\\" and likable.<br />Now, if you can reconcile all of that with a belief that Orwell should be considered a man of the Left and not essentially a conservative, kindly drop<br />us a line and explain.

The lower-middle-class people in there, behind their lace curtains, with their children and their scraps of furniture<br />  and their aspidistras--they lived by the money-code, sure enough, and yet they contrived to keep their decency.  The money-code as they<br />  interpreted it was not merely cynical and hoggish.  They had their standards, their inviolable points of honour.  They 'kept themselves<br />  respectable'--kept the aspidistra flying.  Besides, they were alive.  They were bound up in the bundle of life.  They begot children,<br />  which is what the saints and the soul-savers never by any chance do.<br /><br />  The aspidistra is the tree of life, he thought suddenly.<br />Orwell offers up this wisdom with a light touch.  He also has the characteristically brutal honesty to portray Comstock (his younger self) as quite a<br />horse's arse during his bohemian phase.  This comes through even more clearly in the film, where Comstock (as played by Richard E. Grant) is<br />nearly difficult to like, prior to his epiphany.  It is only when he accepts his own responsibility for the life growing in Rosemary that he comes to be<br />\\"fully human\\" and likable.<br />Now, if you can reconcile all of that with a belief that Orwell should be considered a man of the Left and not essentially a conservative, kindly drop<br />us a line and explain.  Meanwhile, we'll keep the aspidistra flying.<br />GRADE : A	2002-03-16

The site fixed upon, at the representation of the insurance companies, and as being as central a spot as any other on the<br />  globe, was one of the broadest prairies of the West, where no human habitation would be endangered by the flames, and where<br />  a vast assemblage of spectators might commodiously admire the show. Having a taste for sights of this kind, and imagining,<br />  likewise, that the illumination of the bonfire might reveal some profundity or moral truth, heretofore hidden in mist or darkness,<br />  I made it convenient to journey thither and be present.<br />As our narrator watches, into the flames go all of literature and art, the titles and insignias of rank, the decorations and medals bestowed upon<br />soldiers, the weapons, the fashionable clothing, the liquor and tobacco, the clerical vestments and the church buildings entire, all the accretions of<br />Western civilization, until even the Bible is added :<br />  [A]s the final sacrifice of human error, what else remained to be thrown upon the embers of that awful pile, except the Book,<br />  which, though a celestial revelation to past ages, was but a voice from a lower sphere, as regarded the present race of man?<br />  It was done! Upon the blazing heap of falsehood and worn-out truth- things that the earth had never needed, or had ceased to need,<br />  or had grown childishly weary of- fell the ponderous church Bible, the great old volume, that had lain so long on the cushion<br />  of the pulpit, and whence the pastor's solemn voice had given holy utterance on so many a Sabbath day.<br />And so, purified in the flame, and rid of all of the hoary old thoughts that had been holding mankind back for so long, the reformers prepare to face<br />their perfect future.  The former executioners, who have cast into the fire the implements used by the various nations for administering capital<br />punishment, commiserate about how they will no longer have any work, now that Man is perfect, but a stranger interrupts their reverie :<br />  'The best counsel for all of us is,' remarked the hangman, 'that- as soon as we have finished the last drop of liquor- I help you,<br />  my three friends, to a comfortable end upon the nearest tree, and then hang myself on the same bough. This is no world for us<br />  any longer.'<br />  'Poh, poh, my good fellows!' said a dark-complexioned personage, who now joined the group- his complexion was indeed<br />  fearfully dark, and his eyes glowed with a redder light than that of the bonfire- 'Be not so cast down, my dear friends;<br />  you shall see good days yet. There is one thing that these wiseacres have forgotten to throw into the fire, and without which<br />  all the rest of the conflagration is just nothing at all; yes- though they had burnt the earth itself to a cinder.'<br />  'And what may that be?' eagerly demanded the last murderer.<br />  'What but the human heart itself!' said the dark-visaged stranger, with a portentous grin. 'And unless they hit upon some method<br />  of purifying that foul cavern, forth from it will reissue all the shapes of wrong and misery-the same old shapes, or worse ones-<br />  which they have taken such a vast deal of trouble to consume to ashes. I have stood by, this live-long night, and laughed in my<br />  sleeve at the whole business. Oh, take my word for it, it will be the old world yet!'<br />  This brief conversation supplied me with a theme for lengthened thought. How sad a truth- if true it were- that Man's age-long<br />  endeavor for perfection had served only to render him the mockery of the Evil Principle, from the fatal circumstance of an error<br />  at the very root of the matter! The heart-the heart- there was the little yet boundless sphere, wherein existed the original wrong,<br />  of which the crime and misery of this outward world were merely types. Purify that inward sphere; and the many shapes of evil<br />  that haunt the outward, and which now seem almost our only realities, will turn to shadowy phantoms, and vanish of their own<br />  accord. But if we go no deeper than the Intellect, and strive, with merely that feeble instrument, to discern and rectify what is<br />  wrong, our whole accomplishment will be a dream; so unsubstantial, that it matters little whether the bonfire, which I have so<br />  faithfully described, were what we choose to call a real event, and a flame that would scorch the finger- or only a phosphoric<br />  radiance, and a parable of my own brain!<br />For good reason does he call this tale a '\\"parable\\", for in just a few pages Hawthorne presents several of the central themes that unify his work,<br />ideas which form the very core of the conservative critique : that Man's sinfulness is an immutable part of his character; that rationalists, reformers,<br />and progressives delude themselves with their utopian notions of the perfectibility of Man; that in their delusion they do incalculable damage to the<br />culture, while leaving human nature untouched; and that, no matter the \\"progress\\" they make, evil lurks, waiting to rear its ugly head and shatter<br />their dreams.<br />GRADE : A+d thought.

As always in Shakespeare, it's possible to read the play in several ways, but the final verdict seems to be that the assassins were<br />not justified, not least because in replacing one tyranny they unleashed a worse.  This message--the wisdom of erring on the side of<br />stability--would have been particularly resonant in Shakespeare's own day, when religious conflicts, foreign invasion, and wars of dynastic<br />succession were still recent memories and/or active concerns.  Brutus, then, though in some ways a tragic hero, is ultimately too passive a character<br />to really command our loyalty and affection.  And if Caesar and Marc Anthony don't fare much better, we are left to conclude that things would<br />have been better had the established order, even an imperfect order, been allowed to endure.<br />Spring ahead just a few decades from Shakespeare's time though, and the moral of the story becomes problematic.  By the middle of the 17th<br />Century, we are entered upon the Age of Revolutions in the English-Speaking World, and intellectual justification must be found for the series of<br />events that would see Protestants and Parliaments and Colonists overthrow and even execute their kings.  Little wonder then that Joseph Addison's<br />terrific, but largely forgotten, play Cato was such a favorite of the 18th Century and particularly of the Founding Fathers.<br />It too tells the story of a tragic hero's resistance to Caesar, but has none of the ambiguity of Shakespeare.  Marcus Porcius Cato--variously styled<br />Cato of Utica or Cato the Younger--was a Stoic, renowned for his incorruptibility and his intractable devotion to republican principals, the very<br />principals that Caesar trampled upon when he set himself up as a dictator.  Having long opposed Caesar's ambitions, and having alienated many by<br />his inflexibility, Cato was essentially exiled from Rome, along with Pompey.  After Pompey's defeat at Pharsalus, Cato went to Africa where he<br />was allied with Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio.  After Caesar defeated Scipio at Thapsus, Cato killed himself, rather than submit to the<br />man he abhorred.<br />Where Shakespeare gave us a Brutus who was too ambivalent about his own actions and too much affected by events for us to take him to heart as<br />a hero, Joseph Addison rendered his Cato as an achingly noble and uncompromising character, one who may not appeal to modern tastes (of<br />course, we're all moderate in all things now, and a fanaticism, even for freedom, is distasteful in polite society), but who was seized upon as a<br />paragon of unyielding republican virtue by men like George Washington.  In fact, when we consider the nobility of Washington's own action (for<br />example during the Newburgh conspiracy) and the emphasis he placed on preserving his own honor, it seems fair to speculate that the republic we<br />have inherited was handed down to us in some measure by Cato and Addison.<br />The play is filled with quotable lines, like :<br />  A day, an hour, of virtuous liberty<br />  Is worth a whole eternity in bondage.<br />In one passage we hear the foreshadowing of Nathan Hale :<br />  What a pity is it<br />  That we can die but once to save our country!<br />When Cato determines to kill himself he says :<br />  Justice gives way to force: the conquered world<br />  Is Caesar's: Cato has no business in it.<br />And Lucius, a Senate colleague pronounces upon Cato's death :<br />  From hence, let fierce contending nations know<br />  What dire effects from civil discord flow.<br />  'Tis this that shakes our country with alarms,<br />  And gives up Rome a prey to Roman arms,<br />  Produces fraud, and cruelty, and strife,<br />  And robs the guilty world of Cato's life.<br />Sure, it's old-fashioned, both in sentiment and language; how many statesmen still believe in honor at all, let alone in dying to preserve their own.<br />But it's immensely enjoyable and worth knowing if for no other reason than to understand one of the cultural influences that shaped Washington.<br />If we wish to comprehend how he, unlike so many other men in similar position, was able to resist the temptations of power and to instead remain<br />the guarantor of the republic, perhaps it is necessary for us to know Cato.<br />GRADE : A+sentiment and language; how many statesmen still believe in honor at all, let alone in dying to preserve their own.  <BR>But it's immensely enjoyable and worth knowing if for no other reason than to understand one of the cultural influences that shaped Washington.  <BR>If we wish to comprehend how he, unlike so many other men in similar position, was able to resist the temptations of power and to instead remain <BR>the guarantor of the republic, perhaps it is necessary for us to know Cato.<br />GRADE : A+	2002-03-09

Even in college, in a course on<br />modern literature, we didn't actually read the Cantos, instead we read Hugh Kenner's book, The Pound Era.  Still, one would like to understand what made<br />Pound such an important figure in the history of literature and Peter Ackroyd's slender and copiously illustrated biography accomplishes the task quite painlessly.<br />Besides helping us to understand what Pound was trying to achieve in his own poetry--which seems to have been an attempt to capture all of reality within the<br />confines of the poetic form--Mr. Ackroyd shows how profoundly Pound influenced other Modernists, in particular T. S. Eliot and James Joyce.  I'd not<br />previously been aware of the degree to which Pound helped sculpt The Waste Land, to the point that Mr. Ackroyd gives him credit as its virtual co-author :<br />  The transformation of The Waste Land effected by Pound is, although not total, nevertheless remarkable.  What had been a longer,<br />  more sustained and more elaborately lyrical work was changed into something less personal, tighter and more abrupt.  It was precisely<br />  these qualities which were to lend the poem its air of modernity--since, in large part, our notion of what is \\"modern\\" is derived from<br />  Pound's work and criticism.<br />Where Joyce was concerned, Pound appears to have been one of his earliest proselytizers, publishing Portrait of the Artist in serial form in his magazine, The<br />Egoist, and Ulysses in the magazine, The Little Review.  He also reviewed Joyce's work in every publication he could, extolling his virtues to anyone who would<br />listen.  Yet, Pound also had the brutal honesty to assess Finnegan's Wake with the dismissal that it so richly deserved :<br />  Nothing short of divine vision or a new cure for the clapp can possibly be worth all the circumambient peripherization.<br />Unfortunately for Pound, the harshness of that critique reveals a willingness to speak his mind and a forcefulness of opinion which were to get him in<br />considerable trouble when they combined with other personality traits to turn him into a Fascist propagandist.<br />Mr. Ackroyd convincingly locates the appeal of fascism to Pound in the poet's passion for organization and order, his belief in a cultural elite, and his adherence<br />to the odd economic theory of Social Credit, expounded by a Major C. H. Douglas :<br />  Its doctrine states, quite simply, that once money has lost its natural basis in people's needs and aspirations--when, in other words,<br />  it has been turned into a commodity merely to be bought and sold--then the nation and its culture sour.  Money is a complex<br />  measure of man's time and the worth of his labour; when it becomes an anonymous entity to be hoarded and manipulated, all other<br />  human and social values shift downward.  But there was also a blindingly simple economic point to be made in this connection:<br />  the bankers control money at the expense of everyone else in the community.<br />His belief in a social hierarchy is a classic enough conservative position, likewise his fear of cultural decline.  And the rest of Pound's ideas were probably<br />harmless in themselves, even if some were bizarre; but it is this last notion, that the problems one perceives in the world are necessarily a product of some kind of<br />conspiracy, that represents the dangerous spark that all too often ignites hatreds like anti-Semitism.  True conservatism requires the recognition that disorder<br />and decline are natural phenomena, resulting from the debased desires of the masses.  Those who are unable to accept this reality and instead try to blame<br />shadowy conspirators are dangerously deluded.<br />Sadly, Pound fell prey to just such delusions and ended up making radio broadcasts for Mussolini during WWII.  The result ofthese pro-fascist, anti-American,<br />anti-Semitic soliloquies was a 1943 indictment for treason and eventual arrest and, following a finding of insanity, confinement to St. Elizabeth's mental<br />hospital in Washington, DC.  He was kept there until the charge of treason was dismissed on April 18, 1958.  Upon his release, Pound moved back to Italy where<br />he lapsed into a depressive silence and spent his final years in and out of clinics, futilely trying to find some way to recapture his creative powers.<br />If in the end it is not possible for us to feel too much sympathy for a man who betrayed his wife--with a mistress named Olga Rudge by whom he had a daughter<br />and who eventually became his constant companion--and his country, and who spewed venomous hatred of Jews, perhaps it is still possible to acknowledge his<br />achievements, or at least his aspirations, as an artist.  Here's how Mr. Ackroyd summarizes Pound's own literary legacy :<br />  Pound attempted to recreate the whole world in the image of himself and his poetry--despite the divisive tendencies of the age,<br />  and the obsessive weaknesses of his own character.<br />Maybe in this sense we can see writ small in him the larger tragedy of the 20th Century, of men trying to prove themselves equal to the Creator, but failing<br />horribly, and finding it necessary to lash out against others to explain the failure.<br />GRADE : B+ese pro-fascist, anti-American,<BR>anti-Semitic soliloquies was a 1943 indictment for treason and eventual arrest and, following a finding of insanity, confinement to St. Elizabeth's mental<BR>hospital in Washington, DC.

However, the level of public anger that the<br />murders awoke greatly shortened this period of angst and left only a few inveterate self-haters asking these questions...Meanwhile, the rest of<br />America quickly moved on to the more accurate question of...\\"What Went Wrong?\\" with Islam to<br />reduce a once great religion to an ideology of little more than hatred of the West.  Oddly enough, the search for answers to this question sent us<br />scurrying back twenty years, to a couple of books and essays by V. S. Naipaul that were roundly condemned at the time they were written,<br />particularly in the Muslim world, but which can now be recognized as brilliant and prophetic...<br />Among the Believers recounts the author's seven month sojourn across Muslim Asia, from Iran to Pakistan to Malaysia to Indonesia and back<br />again to Iran.  It should be remembered that he traveled in the immediate wake of the Iranian fundamentalist revolution that had overthrown the<br />Shah, with at least implicit approval from Western intellectual elites, and ushered in a supposed new dawn of reform.  But instead of finding<br />cause for hope in the post-Colonial muscle flexing of Islamic regimes, Mr. Naipaul warned instead that the Islamic world was unreconciled to<br />modernity and perhaps irreconcilable.  Here we find Naipaul's assessment of Islamic fundamentalism, one that is finally coming to be accepted,<br />though two decades too late for the folks murdered last September :<br />  In the fundamentalist scheme the world constantly decays and has constantly to be re-created. The only function of intellect is<br />  to assist that re-creation. It reinterprets the texts; it re-establishes divine precedent...The doctrine has its attractions.  To a student from<br /> the University of Karachi, from perhaps a provincial or peasant background, the old faith comes more easily than any<br />  new-fangled academic discipline.  So fundamentalism takes root in the universities, and to deny education can become the<br />  approved educated act.  In the days of Muslim glory Islam opened itself to the learning of the world.  Now fundamentalism<br />  provides an intellectual thermostat, set low.  It equalizes, comforts, shelters, and preserves.<br />  In this way the faith pervades everything, and it is possible to understand what the fundamentalists mean when they say that<br />  Islam is a complete way of life.  But what is said about Islam is true, and perhaps truer, of other religions--like Hinduism or<br />  Buddhism or lesser tribal faiths--that at an early stage in their history were also complete cultures, self-contained and more<br />  or less isolated, with institutions, manners, and beliefs making a whole.<br />  The Islamic fundamentalist wish is to work back to such a whole, for them a God-given whole, but with the tool of faith alone--<br />  belief, religious practices and rituals.  It is like a wish--with intellect suppressed or limited, the historical sense falsified--to work<br />  back from the abstract to the concrete, and to set up the tribal walls again.  It is to seek to re-create something like a tribal or<br />  a city-state that--except in theological fantasy--never was.  The Koran is not the statute book of a settled golden age; it is the<br />  mystical or oracular record of an extended upheaval, widening out from the Prophet to his tribe in Arabia.  Arabia was full<br />  of movement; Islam, with all its Jewish and Christian elements, was always mixed, eclectic, developing.  ...<br />  The West, or the universal civilization it leads, is emotionally rejected.  It undermines; it threatens.  But at the same time it<br />  is needed, for its machines, goods, medicines, warplanes, the remittances from the emigrants, the hospitals that might have<br />  a cure for calcium deficiency, the universities that will provide master's degrees in mass media.  All the rejection of the West<br />  is contained within the assumption that there will always exist out there a living, creative civilization, oddly neutral, open to all<br />  to appeal to.  Rejection, therefore, is not absolute rejection.  It is also, for the community as a whole, a way of ceasing to strive<br />  intellectually.  It is to be parasitic; parasitism is one of the unacknowledged traits of fundamentalism.<br />There in a nutshell...is as good a description as anyone is offering today, some two decades later, of why Islam has turned<br />so radical, so violent, so anti-Western : it has come to be a kind of retrograde utopianism which locates its Utopia not in some bright and idyllic<br />future but in the temporary medieval community created by the Prophet Mohammed fourteen hundred years ago.  It is not the West per se that<br />Islam is at war with, but the progressive tendencies of the West which keep bearing the whole world ever further away from a past that Muslims<br />long to return to.  At first glance the attacks of September 11th may appear to be a kind of mindless nihilism, but from the perspective that<br />Naipaul grants us, we can see that they were a thoughtful form of nihilism.  It becomes obvious that at least fundamentalist Muslims believe<br />that for Islam to return to its former glory, the West must be destroyed.<br />I've enjoyed several of V. S. Naipaul's novels, found others less effective, but this is the best book of his that I've read.  He combines a<br />novelist's gift for characterization, with the observations and scene-sketching of the very best travel writers, then adds to the whole the kind of<br />insightful religio-political analysis that too few Middle East experts have offered us over the last quarter century of Islamic confrontation with<br />the West.

So when such ghoulish crimes did<br />occur, they gave free reign to the newspapers to engage in the most outrageous speculations about peoples backgrounds and behaviors.

One of the things that has really<br />distinguished him from the competition is that he structures his pieces as travelogues, but then uses his experiences and observations, on the<br />ground in some of the modern world's most dangerous nations and regions, to draw out larger lessons that he feels America needs to learn.<br />Among the points that he has repeatedly made, a few stand out and make up his dour vision of the future as a place where : chaos is more the<br />norm than stability, particularly in the Third World; over-population and the resulting scarcity of resources, become the main causes of this<br />near anarchy; the nation-state, even in the West, comes to be replaced borderless multinational corporations in the international sphere and<br />massive urban corridors in the domestic sphere; and, we in the West find ourselves unable to respond to these various crises because, on the<br />one hand, our citizenry has become too materialistic and self-oriented to much care, while our elites do more damage than good by making a<br />fetish of democracy and human rights, which are of little help to nations that have no stable government to begin with.<br />In this rather too lightweight new book Mr. Kaplan argues that his concerns are nothing new, because for the most part they are problems that<br />are the inevitable result of immutable human nature, that indeed they have been dealt with throughout history by some of our greatest writers<br />and philosophers, and that, therefore, one of the best way to prepare ourselves for the future is to return to the wisdom of our past.  Now, no<br />conservative is going to dispute this pessimistic view of human nature, nor the enduring value of reading the authors to whom Mr. Kaplan<br />resorts to try to make his points, but there is much to be wary of in how he uses them and in the end his overall thesis becomes somewhat<br />self-contradictory.<br />To take the last point first, there's something intrinsically odd about a book that seeks to simultaneously argue that we face a bleak future while<br />at the same time maintaining that all of the problems we face have been known and explained for hundreds if not thousands of years, a period<br />during which no one can honestly say that life in the West has not progressed significantly.  To take just one illustrative example, Mr. Kaplan<br />has either the courage or the audacity (which description you choose will depend on your own political views) to trot out Thomas Malthus to<br />support his own theory that rising population must eventually lead to material scarcity.  One would think that the mere fact that mankind has<br />managed to achieve a point where we actually produce an overabundance of food at the same time as we have arrived at a population of 5<br />billion (or whatever) people, would at least make someone timid about advancing this theory, but apparently not.  Unfortunately, Mr. Kaplan<br />here resembles the notorious fool Paul Ehrlich, whose inane book The Population Bomb (1968) predicted that :<br />  The battle to feed all of humanity is over.  In the 1970's the world will undergo famines--hundreds<br />  of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon<br />  now.  At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate...<br />Mr. Ehrlich's hysteria was most effectively answered by the economist Julian Simon, who made a famous wager with him on the change in the<br />cost of a basket of commodities from 1980 to 1990.  Of course, the value of the goods declined by 50% as our capacity to find and develop the<br />necessities of human life grew at a much higher pace than did the population that consumes them.  Yet this ugly failure of the<br />Malthusian/Ehrlichian theory has not prevented Western elites from remaining wedded to it, nor has it hindered the career of Mr. Ehrlich.  Still<br />it would behoove a \\"realist' to be a tad more skeptical towards such a shaky theory.<br />This brings us to another overarching problem, the basic claim to realism.  As the British historian Herbert Butterfield  remarked, to<br />devastating effect, \\"realism is more often a boast than a philosophy.\\"  This truth is on display here in the way that Mr. Kaplan uses, or perhaps<br />it's more accurate to say, misuses history to claim credit for Realists.  ...es them.

Whether we welcome or mourn this loss, it is the central and irreversible fact of modern history<br />  that we no longer inhabit a world of transcendence.  The idea that man is a receptor of truth from God has been relinquished,<br />  and replaced with the idea that reality is an unstable zone between phenomena (unknowable in themselves) and innumerable<br />  fields of mental activity (which we call persons) by which they are apprehended.  These apprehensions are expressed through<br />  language, which is always evolving, and which constitutes the only reality we recognize.  Our world exists in the ceaseless<br />  movement of human consciousness, a process in which the reception of new impressions is indistinguishable from the production<br />  of new meanings: 'mind's willful transference of nature, man, and society--and eventually of God, and finally of mind itself--<br />  into itself.'<br />Where Mr. Delbanco had begun by telling us  \\"we cannot do without some conceptual means for thinking about the sorts of experiences that<br />used to go under the name of evil,\\" now he tells us that instead :<br />  [T]he story I have tried to tell is the story of the advance of secular rationality in the United States, which has been relentless<br />  in the face of all resistance.  It is the story of a culture that has gradually withdrawn its support from the old conception of a<br />  universe seething with divine intelligence and has left its members with only one recourse: to acknowledge that no story about<br />  the intrinsic meaning of the world has universal validity.<br />From here on, things get really muddled, as having just surrendered to a worldview that even he has acknowledged leaves us with a gaping<br />void in our lives and fuels our inhumanity toward one another, we next find him telling us that the \\"party of secular humanism, of which I<br />consider myself a member, has deluded itself into believing that human beings can manage without any metaphor at all\\" and then that \\"the idea<br />of evil is not just a metaphor that 'some people find...useful'; it is a metaphor upon which the health of society depends.\\"<br />This really leaves him no other option but to try and construct a secular metaphor for evil.  Tellingly, he turns to (and apparently misinterprets)<br />St. Augustine for help.  He says that St. Augustine rejected the idea that evil could be objectified (as Satan or as some other person or group of<br />people), and instead identified evil as 'an essential nothingness.'  Mr. Delbanco has decided that the \\"nothingness\\" of which this version of evil<br />consists is a kind of absence of sufficient love for others in our own hearts.  Of course, the objections to this idea are too numerous to address<br />completely, but a few will do.  First, having rejected the idea of universal truths, how does Mr. Delbanco decide what actions are evil to begin<br />with?  What is wrong with the Holocaust or the Killing Fields or Jim Crow if there are no universally valid meanings of good and evil?<br />Second, note that by defining evil as an absence of something you, in effect, deny the existence of evil.  The lack of something can not be that<br />thing.  Hunger is the lack of food, not the absence of hunger.  Third, when St. Augustine spoke of evil as a lack of something he didn't mean<br />some generic kind of thing, but the absence of good, or godliness.  Unfortunately for Mr. Delbanco, when he earlier in the book disposed of<br />universal truths and of evil, he necessarily threw the concept of good away too.  Fourth, the very essence of the story of Man's Fall is that evil<br />lurks within us all.  Strongly held religious beliefs may sometimes lead to unfortunate prejudices, and they will necessarily lead us to harsh, but<br />often just, judgments about the behavior and beliefs of others, but Judeo-Christian (which is to say American) religious beliefs also recognize<br />the evil that is an immutable part of our own souls.  In the words of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn :<br />  If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them<br />  from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.<br />  And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart.<br />In his purblind secular humanist resistance to even his own analysis, Mr. Delbanco simply can not admit the power, never mind the truth, of<br />the Judeo-Christian metaphor, that Man is Fallen, and has within him not only the capacity but the barely controlled (and not always<br />controlled) desire to do evil to his fellow men.  It is important too to note that this metaphor lies at the heart of conservatism but must be utterly<br />rejected by liberalism, for if Man is not essentially good, then, all things being equal, he can not be trusted to behave well, as all philosophies<br />of the Left assume that he will.  Mr. Delbanco's political philosophy lies smoldering in the same ash heap as his attempted metaphor.<br />And so, Mr. Delbanco concludes :<br />  My driving motive in writing [this book] has been the conviction that if evil, with all the insidious complexity which<br />  Augustine attributed to it, escapes the reach of our imagination, it will have established dominion over us all. ...<br />  I have felt compelled to insist that Satan, always receding and always sought after, has had two very different meanings<br />  in our history.  Sometimes he has been used for the purpose of construing the other as a monster, and sometimes...he<br />  has been a symbol of our own deficient love, our potential for envy and rancor toward creation.  Since the experience<br />  of evil will not go away, one or the other of these ways of coping with it sooner or later always comes back.<br />  The former way--evil as the other--is, at least at first, physically rewarding.  The latter way--evil as privation--is much more<br />  difficult to grasp.  But it offers something that the devil himself could never have intended: the miraculous paradox of<br />  demanding the best of ourselves.<br />As near as I can tell, the suggestion here is that the religious metaphor for evil gives us racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, etc., but that<br />his secular metaphor shows us that all we really need is more--more love, more stuff, more whatever...  In the end, Mr. Delbanco has achieved<br />nothing more than to bring us back to where we started.  Having started out by telling us that we can't exist without having a framework by<br />which we understand evil, he ends by offering one that, though compatible with his science, is totally inadequate to our needs.<br />Mr. Delbanco is fond of citing examples from popular culture, but there's one artifact that he's somehow missed : The Exorcist.  It's absence<br />from this book is particularly noticeable because his predicament so resembles that of the hero.  If you'll recall, Father Damian has lost his faith<br />in God, but is suddenly confronted by a monstrous evil.  As he gradually comes to believe that the evil is a manifestation of Satan, so too is he<br />able to once again believe in God, and this gives him the strength of will to defeat the evil.  In a strange way, it takes acceptance of the<br />antithesis to restore his faith in the thesis.<br />But really, it's not so strange; if you accept that evil is real, how can you not accept that good is real?  And if pure reason suggests that these<br />are merely words, just definitions and not realities, but every fiber of your being tells you that they exist and that you can differentiate the one<br />from the other and that one is preferable to the other, then who will not choose to believe and who will not choose good over evil?  And having<br />just this once chosen to doubt the efficacy of reason and its baneful cosmogony, mightn't we eventually be willing to make a kind of Pascal's<br />Wager  and once again embrace the transcendent wisdom of the religious metaphor, despite its superstitious taint?  If subjecting ourselves to<br />the thralldom of reason leaves us abandoned in a world that we find atavistic and repulsive, mightn't we choose to view reason as a useful but<br />limited tool, ultimately incapable of explaining existence or our purpose in life to our satisfaction?  It may be true that the \\"beliefs\\" that most of<br />us hoi polloi share and upon which Western Civilization was erected are not an option for the \\"thinking people\\" with whom Mr. Delbanco<br />consorts, but if he is so unhappy with the option they've chosen instead, perhaps the problem lies not in our \\"beliefs\\" but in their \\"thinking\\".<br />GRADE : Cour own deficient love, our potential for envy and rancor toward creation.

In this book, not only is there no<br />  happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. This is because not very many happy things<br />  happened in the lives of the three Baudelaire youngsters. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire were intelligent children, and they were<br />  charming and resourceful, and had pleasant facial features, but they were extremely unlucky, and most everything that happened to them<br />  was rife with misfortune, misery and despair. I'm sorry to tell you this, but that's how the story goes.<br />Thus begins Book 1, A Bad Beginning, of Lemony Snicket's immensely popular series of dour children's books, A Series of Unfortunate<br />Events.  Of course, I only know that because I found an excerpt on-line.  The rotten little kids in our town have had every installment in the<br />series checked out of our library every day for the past year.  But the other day when the K-Mart one-hour photolab took about four hours, I<br />picked up and read enough of volume 8, The Hostile Hospital, that I more-or-less had to buy it.  So now I see why they're so popular.<br />You'll often see Lemony Snicket compared to Roald Dahl or Edward Gorey because the books have such an edge of dark humor to them.  But<br />more than anything, they are reminiscent of The Phantom Tollbooth or the works of Lewis Carroll, for the author's great love and witty use of<br />language.  Many of the in-jokes will go over the heads of children, but serve to make the books more appealing to adults--for instance, the<br />children's names : Klaus and Sunny (as in von Bulow).  But the central theme of the book is that it is the children's skills and learning that will<br />enable them to escape from dire predicaments :<br />  When you read as many books as Klaus Baudelaire, you are going to learn a great deal of information that might not be useful<br />  for a long time.  You might read a book that would teach you about the exploration of outer space, even if you do not become<br />  an astronaut until you are eighty years old.  You might read a book about how to perform tricks on ice skates, and then not be<br />  forced to perform these tricks for a few weeks.  You might read a book on how to have a successful marriage, when the only<br />  woman you will ever love has married someone else and then perished one terrible afternoon.  But although Klaus had read books<br />  on outer-space exploration, ice-skating tricks, and good marriage methods, and not yet found much use for this information,<br />  he had learned a great deal of information that was about to become very useful indeed.<br />It's become commonplace to say that JK Rowling has gotten kids to read again, but the Lemony Snicket books go one step farther and<br />encourage kids to read, to learn, to expand their vocabularies, to value knowledge and use it to solve problems.<br />Add to this the fact that the books are packaged beautifully--they even feel good in your hands--with excellent illustrations by Brett Helquist,<br />and you've got a series that belongs on every kid's bookshelf.

1681562:US	52173832	RXSIUD990ZL1K	0393309568	555138894	Abortion: The Clash of Absolutes	Books	1	26	88	N	N	like Bull Connor on improving race relations	Set aside, for a moment, the question of whether you want abortion to be a right or not, and consider only how the Court got to the point where<br />it made its ruling.  It had, first, to assume the right, nowhere spelled out in the Constitution, to review the constitutionality of laws.  It had,<br />next, to extend its reach to state laws, which had several times been explicitly placed beyond its grasp.  It had, then, to rely upon a \\"right to<br />privacy\\" which exists nowhere in the language of the Constitution.  The issue that confronts even those who support abortion is : are we a<br />nation of laws, a constitutional republic, or are we mere creatures of the judiciary, prey to their every whim?  For if we are to allow the Court<br />to seize new powers and create entirely new \\"rights\\" when we like the results, we must also be prepared to acquiesce when they start arriving at<br />results we abhor.  To accept that the Court can make unprincipled decisions is to abandon the notion that they can be bound by principle.<br />It is especially important to note here that it might have been possible to secure abortion rights without utilizing these subterfuges and<br />imperious court rulings.  People who wish to have a right of privacy protected by the Constitution need only propose and pass an amendment<br />that would do so.  This is the system that the Founders, in their wisdom, put in place for making changes to our system of governance and to<br />what rights we choose to afford special protection from government.  It also has the very great advantage of actually being democratic.  In<br />particular, such a radical alteration of the scheme of protected rights would seem to be best accomplished via the democratic and constitutional<br />processes, rather than by judicial fiat.  Presumably, proponents of privacy rights chose not to follow this course because such an amendment<br />would be unlikely to pass.  They instead chose the judicial route precisely because it is antidemocratic and allowed them to overcome the will<br />of the people.  This success has been followed by entirely predictable hostility on the part of many Americans, as should be any effort to make<br />an end run on democracy.<br />Meanwhile, although conservatives could spin out even more compelling arguments for a right to life, which is after all specifically mentioned<br />in the text of the Constitution, many ask for far less than this.  We really would just like the Court to butt out and allow the States to regulate<br />abortion as their citizens see fit.  This, the direction in which the country was headed before Roe was decided, would allow the more<br />permissive states on the two coasts to permit fairly easy access to abortions while allowing more traditional states and populations to restrict or<br />even ban them.  It would return the issue to the rough and tumble of democratic debate and restore the primacy of the Constitution, rather than<br />of judges.  It's hard to see how one can both believe in our system of government and oppose the idea of returning abortion to the political<br />sphere.<br />As for the rest of Mr. Tribe's book, bad enough that his discussion of the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade is so dishonest, Mr. Tribe also<br />includes a history of abortion in America that has been thoroughly discredited, much like Michael Bellesiles's fabricated history of gun<br />ownership.  It reaches a spectacular height of delusion when he asserts that the absence of anti-abortion laws early in our history indicates a<br />general societal acceptance of the practice.  We might similarly argue that terrorism was accepted in the 19th Century because there were no<br />anti-terrorism laws.  He proceeds from there to a discussion of abortion in other societies that is a complete non sequitir.  Should we also<br />legalize infanticide because the Chinese use it?  Maybe we're just lagging behind other cultures in not practicing female circumcision?  This<br />kind of reasoning hardly deserves the name.<br />When we get to Mr. Tribe's attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of the abortion debate, the partisan nature of his analysis is perhaps<br />adequately demonstrated with just a few quotes :<br />  [T]he feeling that abortion should be blocked by government may grow, at least in part, out of a reflexive willingness to enforce<br />  traditional sex roles upon women and to impose upon them an unequal and harsh sexual morality.<br />Note the contempt for tradition and morality?  the assumption that opposition to abortion is \\"reflexive\\" and a mere \\"feeling\\", while support<br />would of course be reasoned?  and the incoherent thought that prohibiting abortion is unequal?  Of course, Mr. Tribe fails to consider that<br />allowing abortion is unequal too, since men can't have them and it takes the decision out of men's hands.  The argument that abortion has to be<br />made legal if women are to be treated equally with men makes about as little sense as arguing that rape should be made legal in order for men<br />to be treated equally with women.<br />At another point he refers to antiabortionists as believing, \\"that men and women are different by nature and that they have intrinsically different<br />roles to play in society.\\"  Did I miss something?  Are men and women now the same?  Perhaps we've located the real problem in this whole<br />debate.  Maybe Mr. Tribe just isn't aware that it is only the female of the species that bears children.  His real disagreement is not with abortion<br />opponents but with Nature.<br />And so, having misled us on the law, the history, and the biology of abortion, Mr. Tribe arrives at his final advice to us :<br />  For both sides...a greater measure of humility seems in order.  If we genuinely believe in the democratic principle of one person,<br />  one vote, then each of us will have to treat the votes, and hear the voices, of our opponents as being no less worthy or meaningful<br />  than our own.<br />  On both sides of the abortion debate, this will require an unaccustomed and in some ways unnatural forbearance.  Right-to-life<br />  advocates are inclined to respond to pleas for tolerance by insisting that the exclusion of the fetus from the processes of voting<br />  and debate distorts the discussion profoundly from the outset, for reasons that bear no proper relation to a moral or just outcome.<br />  That the fetus is voiceless and voteless, they may say, follows from a biological condition but is irrelevant to how society is<br />  morally bound to behave.<br />  And pro-choice advocates are inclined to react to pleas for mutual respect by insisting, no less vehemently, that it begs the question<br />  to attribute legitimacy to the views of those who tell women how to lead their lives and what to do with their bodies.  To submit a<br />  woman's fate to a popular referendum, they may insist, already assumes that the matter is properly one to be resolved by voting.<br />  In the end, the answer to both sides is the same : In a democracy, voting and persuasion are all we have.  Not even the Constitution<br />  is beyond amendment.  And since we must therefore persuade one another even about which 'rights' the Constitution ought to place<br />  beyond  the reach of any temporary voting majority, nothing, neither life nor liberty, can be regarded as immune from politics writ<br />  large.  Either some of the views expressed in the political arena are to be privileged and untouchable from the start or all views are<br />  to count equally, those of the supposedly less sophisticated no less than those of the self-professedly more tolerant elite.<br />The reader will feel justified in believing that they've accidentally wandered into a different book at this point.  For in what has come before,<br />Mr. Tribe has demonstrated that Roe v. Wade is not the product of \\"one man, one vote\\", and in defending it anyway has effectively shown<br />himself not to believe in democratic principles.  And, whatever his point about the voiceless fetus, the complaint of pro-lifers is that their own<br />voices are not heard, because the Court has placed abortion beyond the reach of anything except a Constitutional Amendment or an activist<br />Right-wing majority.  So the point that he has italicized (presumably indicating its importance), about voting and persuasion, is quite wrong, as<br />he must well know.  It is possible for the Court to create a privilege for some views, as it has done with abortion, and to thwart the both the<br />majority and the Constitution itself.  The clash of absolutes, as it regards the opposing views of whether abortion is morally defensible, is<br />probably unresolvable.  But it is vitally important to our democracy that we resolve the clash between those who favor judicial usurpation of<br />power, so long as it achieves ends with which they agree, and those who believe that courts must be bound by the text of the Constitution, as<br />written, by the American people.  Perhaps we are at the point, that Albert Jay Nock foresaw, where our society has become :<br />  ...tired of itself, bored by its own hideor meaningful<br />  than our own.<br />  On both sides of the abortion debate, this will require an unaccustomed and in some ways unnatural forbearance.  Right-to-life<br />  advocates are inclined to respond to pleas for tolerance by insisting that the exclusion of the fetus from the processes of voting<br />  and debate distorts the discussion profoundly from the outset, for reasons that bear no proper relation to a moral or just outcome.<br />  That the fetus is voiceless and voteless, they may say, follows from a biological condition but is irrelevant to how society is<br />  morally bound to behave.<br />  And pro-choice advocates are inclined to react to pleas for mutual respect by insisting, no less vehemently, that it begs the question<br />  to attribute legitimacy to the views of those who tell women how to lead their lives and what to do with their bodies.  To submit a<br />  woman's fate to a popular referendum, they may insist, already assumes that the matter is properly one to be resolved by voting.<br />  In the end, the answer to both sides is the same : In a democracy, voting and persuasion are all we have.  Not even the Constitution<br />  is beyond amendment.  And since we must therefore persuade one another even about which 'rights' the Constitution ought to place<br />  beyond  the reach of any temporary voting majority, nothing, neither life nor liberty, can be regarded as immune from politics writ<br />  large.  Either some of the views expressed in the political arena are to be privileged and untouchable from the start or all views are<br />  to count equally, those of the supposedly less sophisticated no less than those of the self-professedly more tolerant elite.<br />The reader will feel justified in believing that they've accidentally wandered into a different book at this point.  For in what has come before,<br />Mr. Tribe has demonstrated that Roe v. Wade is not the product of \\"one man, one vote\\", and in defending it anyway has effectively shown<br />himself not to believe in democratic principles.  And, whatever his point about the voiceless fetus, the complaint of pro-lifers is that their own<br />voices are not heard, because the Court has placed abortion beyond the reach of anything except a Constitutional Amendment or an activist<br />Right-wing majority.  So the point that he has italicized (presumably indicating its importance), about voting and persuasion, is quite wrong, as<br />he must well know.  It is possible for the Court to create a privilege for some views, as it has done with abortion, and to thwart the both the<br />majority and the Constitution itself.  The clash of absolutes, as it regards the opposing views of whether abortion is morally defensible, is<br />probably unresolvable.  But it is vitally important to our democracy that we resolve the clash between those who favor judicial usurpation of<br />power, so long as it achieves ends with which they agree, and those who believe that courts must be bound by the text of the Constitution, as<br />written, by the American people.

Robert Oppenheimer, quoting the Bhagavad-Gita, July 16, 1945, Alamogordo, New Mexico<br />Eyebrows were raised and feathers ruffled this week, when Leon R. Kass, appointed by George W. Bush to head the President's Council on Bioethics, asked the newly chosen members of the Council to read Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story, The Birthmark, prior to their first meeting.  Even the English majors among us were sent scurrying to find this less well known work, which thankfully is available on-line.  And what do you find when you track it down?  Well, it turns out to be a well turned American Frankenstein tale that obviously appeals to Mr. Kass for its portrayal of a &quot;man of science&quot; with more than his share of hubris.  Condescending sniping from libertarians and the Left has already begun.<br />The scientist, named Aylmer, is married to an almost perfectly beautiful woman, whose one slight imperfection is a birthmark on her cheek.  Despite her near flawlessness :<br />  [H]e found this one defect grow more and more intolerable with every moment of their united lives. It was the fatal flaw<br />  of humanity which Nature, in one shape or another, stamps ineffaceably on all her productions, either to imply that they<br />  are temporary and finite, or that their perfection must be wrought by toil and pain. The crimson hand expressed the ineludible<br />  gripe in which mortality clutches the highest and purest of earthly mould, degrading them into kindred with the lowest,<br />  and even with the very brutes, like whom their visible frames return to dust. In this manner, selecting it as the symbol<br />  of his wife's liability to sin, sorrow, decay, and death, Aylmer's sombre imagination was not long in rendering the birthmark<br />  a frightful object...<br />Convinced that his mastery of science will surely allow him to remove this blemish and bring her to perfection, Aylmer convinces his wife to allow him to experiment on her, to improve upon nature :<br />  'Aylmer,' resumed Georgiana, solemnly, 'I know not what may be the cost to both of us to rid me of this fatal birthmark.<br />  Perhaps its removal may cause cureless deformity; or it may be the stain goes as deep as life itself. Again: do we know<br />  that there is a possibility, on any terms, of unclasping the firm gripe of this little hand which was laid upon me before<br />  I came into the world?'<br />  'Dearest Georgiana, I have spent much thought upon the subject,' hastily interrupted Aylmer. &quot;I am convinced of the perfect<br />  practicability of its removal.'<br />  'If there be the remotest possibility of it,' continued Georgiana, 'let the attempt be made at whatever risk. Danger is nothing<br />  to me; for life, while this hateful mark makes me the object of your horror and disgust,--life is a burden which I would fling<br />  down with joy.  Either remove this dreadful hand, or take my wretched life! You have deep science. All the world bears witness<br />  of it. You have achieved great wonders. Cannot you remove this little, little mark, which I cover with the tips of two small fingers?<br />  Is this beyond your power, for the sake of your own peace, and to save your poor wife from madness?&quot;<br />  'Noblest, dearest, tenderest wife,' cried Aylmer, rapturously, 'doubt not my power. I have already given this matter the<br />  deepest thought--thought which might almost have enlightened me to create a being less perfect than yourself. Georgiana,<br />  you have led me deeper than ever into the heart of science. I feel myself fully competent to render this dear cheek as faultless<br />  as its fellow; and then, most beloved, what will be my triumph when I shall have corrected what Nature left imperfect<br />  in her fairest work! EvenPygmalion, when his sculptured woman assumed life, felt not greater ecstasy than mine will be.'<br />  'It is resolved, then,' said Georgiana, faintly smiling. 'And, Aylmer, spare me not, though you should find the birthmark<br />  take refuge in my heart at last.'<br />How perfectly Hawthorne, even 150 years ago, captures the deluded pride of the man of science, certain that this figurative mark of Cain (it is even shaped like a hand) will yield to the ministrations of reason and science and that he will be able to improve on God's work, will be able to make a perfect human.  That peremptory &quot;doubt not my power&quot; is particularly devastating.<br />As Aylmer whips up concoctions that even he doubts the ultimate wisdom of using, Georgiana can't help but be alarmed :<br />  He more than intimated that it was at his option to concoct a liquid that should prolong life for years, perhaps interminably;<br />  but that it would produce a discord in Nature which all the world, and chiefly the quaffer of the immortal nostrum, would<br />  find cause to curse.<br />  'Aylmer, are you in earnest?' asked Georgiana, looking at him with amazement and fear. 'It is terrible to possess such power,<br />  or even to dream of possessing it.'<br />Note that her warning is not simply about the power of such an elixir, but that the very ambition to possess it is &quot;terrible.&quot;<br />But, of course, having opened Pandora's Box, Aylmer will not be deterred from his course of action, so he foists a goblet of some foul liquid upon her and, sure enough :<br />  The crimson hand, which at first had been strongly visible upon the marble paleness of Georgiana's cheek, now grew more<br />  faintly outlined. She remained not less pale than ever; but the birthmark with every breath that came and went, lost somewhat<br />  of its former distinctness. Its presence had been awful; its departure was more awful still. Watch the stain of the rainbow<br />  fading out the sky, and you will know how that mysterious symbol passed away.<br />  'By Heaven! it is well-nigh gone!' said Aylmer to himself, in almost irrepressible ecstasy. 'I can scarcely trace it now.  Success!<br />  success! And now it is like the faintest rose color. The lightest flush of blood across her cheek would overcome it. But she is so pale!'<br />Ah yes, except for that 'pale' part, well might he be ecstatic.  But as the reader will have guessed by now, all is not well :<br />  'My poor Aylmer,' she repeated, with a more than human tenderness, 'you have aimed loftily; you have done nobly. Do not repent<br />  that with so high and pure a feeling, you have rejected the best the earth could offer. Aylmer, dearest Aylmer, I am dying!'<br />The key here is the &quot;more than human&quot; and its suggestion that such perfection is not compatible with humanity.

And there I find myself hoist on my own petard, having frequently raged against the<br />obscurantism of authors like James Joyce, but now endorsing a poet who is nearly as impenetrable at times.  So, first, let me acknowledge that<br />I am willing to forgive more from Mr. Hill because I favor his dark moral/religious/political take on modern England, than I would be from<br />someone who was just being obscure for obscurity's sake, say Joyce or Pynchon.  Second, I do think we, justifiably, tend to give poets more<br />leeway than novelists; after all, by the very effort they have to put in to achieving a chiseled brevity they earn some right to ask a little more<br />effort of us readers.  The nearly forty poems here do not fill even eighty pages, so if you have to read them once or twice, or ten times, it<br />doesn't seem as onerous a task as trudging through hundreds of densely printed pages of a novel.<br />Mr. Hill's themes and methods are signaled early on, in the title of the collection and in the epigraph :<br />  ...So ye children of Israel did wickedly in the<br />  sight of the Lord, &amp; forgate the Lord their God,<br />  &amp; serued Baalim, and Asheroth ... Yea, they<br />  offred their sonnes, and their daughters vnto<br />  diuels, And shed innocent blood, euen the blood<br />  of their soones, and of their daughters, whome<br />  they offred vnto the idols of Canaan, and the<br />  land they defiled with blood.  Thus were they<br />  steined with their owne inuentions ... o<br />  Canaan, the land of the Philistims, I wil euen<br />  destroy thee without an inhabitant.<br />  Judges 3:7; Psalm 106: 37-9; Zephaniah 2:5<br />  (from the Geneva Bible of 1560)<br />The Geneva Bible of 1560?  Okay, so he's delving back into the past, to a vibrant and impassioned form of ruggedly fundamentalist<br />Protestantism and a Bible written by Brits in exile (note that Professor Hill himself is and has been at Boston University); comparing modern<br />England to ancient Canaan, and casting himself in the role of doomsayer.  The reader has been warned.<br />Here's an example of one of the more accessible pieces :<br />  DARK-LAND<br />  Wherein Wesley stood<br />  up from his father's grave,<br />  summoned familiar dust<br />  for strange salvation:<br />  whereto England rous'd,<br />  ignorant, her inane<br />  Midas-like hunger: smoke<br />  engrossed, cloud-encumbered,<br />  a spectral people<br />  raking among the ash;<br />  its freedom a lost haul<br />  of entailed riches.<br />I've no idea who Wesley and his father are, though I assume it's John Wesley (1703-91), the founder of Methodism, but can tell you that this<br />bleak vision taps into three of Mr. Hill's favorite themes : of England as having become excessively materialistic, even hedonistic; of<br />hard-won British liberty as a thing of the past; and of post-War Europe as an ash heap.  That much I think I follow.<br />Or consider just two of the images from a poem, most of which I didn't understand, DE JURE BELLI AC PACIS, which is written in memory<br />of Hans-Bernd von Haeften, who plotted against murder and was executed in 1944.  The first :<br />  Could none predict these haughty degradations<br />  as now your high-strung<br />  martyred resistance serves<br />  to consecrate the liberties of Maastricht.<br />followed later by :<br />  To the high-minded<br />  base-metal forgers of this common Europe,<br />  community of parody, you stand ec-<br />  centric as a prophet.<br />Even without being able to follow every elusive allusion in the poem, and without knowing anything of von Haeften, you can easily discern<br />the message that Mr. Hill is contemptuous of the new European Union, based solely on economic integration, with no thought given to the<br />unlikelihood of ever turning these disparate nations into a genuine community, and little regard given to the surrender of sovereignty and<br />freedom it will require.<br />Even if you are unmoved by the specter of England subjugating itself to French and German bureaucrats and indifferent to the economism of<br />modern British society, you may have trouble figuring out why Geoffrey Hill sounds so angry, so much at times like an Old Testament<br />prophet.  But think on this quote from Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor :<br />  It does seem in our countries in Britain today, especially in England and Wales, that Christianity, as a sort of backdrop to people's lives<br />  and moral decisions - and to the Government, the social life of the country - has now almost been vanquished.<br />or this one from Dr. George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury :<br />  A tacit atheism prevails. Death is assumed to be the end of life, bleak though that thought is. If we need hope to clutch to our breast at all<br />  it will be in such greatly scaled down forms, such as our longings for family happiness, the next holiday or personal fulfilment. Our<br />  concentration on the here and now renders thoughts of eternity irrelevant.<br />All of which brings us back to the Biblical Canaan, where the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord and so were sold into slavery.  Simply<br />as a literary matter, Geoffrey Hill's poems here are a powerful evocation of the idea that something similar is happening now to England and<br />the British people, that they have become a post-Christian and demoralized society.

What redeemed him was a keen, beautiful, logical mind.<br />  -Lloyd S. Shapley, The Lost Years of a Nobel Laureate (Sylvia Nasar, November 13, 1994, NY Times)<br />It is simply the case that we treat extraordinary people differently than we treat average people.  When it comes to beautiful women or gifted<br />athletes we tend to find this double standard appalling, yet when it comes to genius, we tend to accept it as something to which they are<br />entitled.  This is the largely unacknowledged subtext that plays out in Sylvia Nasar's interesting but overlong, biography of Nobel Laureate<br />John Nash.  A brilliant young mathematician, Nash stood out for both the quality of his mind and the unpleasantness of his personality even<br />within the eccentric world of academic mathematics.  He developed an apparently well-deserved reputation for attacking problems from<br />unique angles, inventing his own ways of arriving to the already solved steps along the way, making intuitive leaps, which would only later be<br />proven, and deriving final solutions which seemed so improbable as to be impossible to colleagues.  While still a graduate student at Princeton<br />he took up the study of game theory, which was in its infancy and which John von Neumann, who was at Princeton's Institute for Advanced<br />Study (as was Albert Einstein), had been pioneering--Nasar has some particularly fascinating detail about the board games that the students<br />and professors invented for themselves, one of which was actually called \\"Nash\\" because he invented it.  His interest led him to come up with<br />an innovation called the \\"Nash Equilibrium\\" :<br /><br />Nash, in these early years, was rude, fanatically competitive, condescending, socially awkward, and prone to developing passionate crushes on<br />other men.  Yet these behaviors--with the possible exception of his bisexuality--were generally accepted as the typical eccentricities of a great<br />mathematician--as if toleration of such usually intolerable behavior was no more than the price we all have to pay to bask in the presence of<br />genius.  (Ms Nasar even proposes an interesting idea, that Nash's very lack of social skills may have helped him to come up with his theory of<br />equilibrium.)  But Nash did alienate some people, both by the way he acted and just by being more gifted than they, and eventually some of<br />these personality aberrations did catch up to him.  One of the most important instances as far as his career was concerned occurred when he<br />was working at the Rand Corporation in California (in 1954), but was dismissed after being arrested for indecent exposure in a Santa Monica<br />men's room.  This was vital because it effectively barred him from most of the quite extensive work that government was funding under the<br />auspices of the Cold War.  Maybe the most revelatory as far as his sense of entitlement was the child, John David Stier, he had out of wedlock<br />with Eleanor Stier, a Boston nurse who he may or may not have intended to marry at some point.  Instead he married Alicia Larde, a beautiful<br />El Salvadoran MIT student, one of whose chief attractions certainly seems to have been that she made a more appealing accouterment to his<br />lofty career ambitions.<br />The couple had a son, Nash got tenure at MIT and he continued to do exciting, breakthrough mathematical work (with partial differential<br />equations in particular), but he did not receive the formal recognition by which he was determined to judge the progress of his career<br />(including not winning a prestigious medal reserved for young mathematicians), and so began to take on more extravagantly difficult problems<br />: quantum theory in physics and Riemann's Hypothesis in the field of number theory.  His study in these areas, which had perplexed<br />generations of scientists and mathematicians, refused to yield up the spectacular insights to which he had become accustomed.  Meanwhile,<br />several personal crises cropped up, including a second pregnancy for Alicia and a bout of unrequited love for a younger and equally brilliant<br />mathematician, Paul Cohen.  Whether the cumulative effect of all these stress-inducing factors played a role or whether the disease was<br />completely organic and developed at its own pace, in 1959, at age 30, Nash began to display increasingly clear symptoms of paranoid<br />schizophrenia.  Among other manifestations, he became obsessed with the idea of world government and on a trip to Europe tried repeatedly<br />to renounce his American citizenship.<br />So began a period of thirty years during which he would be in and out of mental institutions, enjoying periodic stretches of relative stability,<br />but largely disappearing from the academic world.  Though friends and former colleagues did sometimes manage to secure him work, he<br />could not really return to teaching.  And though he eventually wound up living with her, he and Alicia were divorced.  In the end he was<br />reduced to wandering the streets of Princeton and the halls of the school, writing strange messages on blackboards and earning the nickname<br />\\"The Phantom of Fine Hall.\\"<br />Then, in the 1980s, with no more plausible explanation than there was for its onset, the severity of Nash's disease abated drastically and he<br />was once again able to interact coherently with others and even to do some mathematical work that made sense.  So, just at the time--in the<br />mid-80s--that the Nobel Economics committee began considering awarding a prize for work done in the field of game theory, Nash began to<br />regain enough grasp on reality that he came to be a considered a serious candidate.  In what may be the most fascinating portion of the book,<br />Ms Nasar details the absurd behind-the-scenes power struggles that went on in the Nobel committee, but in the end, of course, he did become<br />a Nobel Laureate in 1994.<br />The arc of the story has so much natural appeal and Nash so exemplifies our perverse desire for genius to approach madness that the book<br />can't help but compel our interest.  Yet, as I read I couldn't help feeling that Ms Nasar had fallen prey to the aforementioned double standard<br />in so far as her sympathy for Nash and her awe of his genius lead her to repeatedly excuse even behaviors that are not clearly related to his<br />disease.

A ghost story, he believes, should have a familiar setting in the modern period, in order to approach closely the<br />  reader's sphere of experience. Its spectral phenomena, moreover, should be malevolent rather than beneficent; since fear is the emotion<br />  primarily to be excited. And finally, the technical patois of 'occultism' or pseudo-science ought carefully to be avoided; lest the charm of<br />  casual verisimilitude be smothered in unconvincing pedantry.<br />  -H.P. Lovecraft<br />Though less well remembered today than some other authors of Gothic ghost stories--like J. S. [John Sheridan] LeFanu, whose work he<br />edited,  Bram Stoker, and Henry James (no relation), or their successors H.P. Lovecraft, Algernon Blackwood, and the like--M. R. James is<br />one of the great early horror writers.  This story, which concerns a mysterious and unpleasant Mr. Karswell, who takes creepy exception to a<br />negative review of his book, The Truth of Alchemy, shows off James's talents to good effect, combining genuine scares with a droll wit.<br />But what makes this edition particularly appealing are the 12 splendid black-and-white drawings by Jeff White--an artist with whom I am not<br />familiar and about whom I could find nearly nothing on the Web--that accompany the text.

Drawing mainly on three<br />historical examples--Epaminondas leading Thebes against Sparta; Sherman marching through the South; and Patton driving the Third Army<br />to Berlin--Mr. Hanson illustrates the similarities among these different leaders, the men they led, and the ideals for which they fought.  He<br />makes a compelling case that there is no more dangerous military force in human history than a democratic populace, raised to righteous<br />moral anger, and commanded by leaders who understand the unique strength of such an army.  He demonstrates that though even we tend to<br />accept the myth, fond in the hearts of totalitarian leaders and the rest of those who hate us, that democracies are necessarily inefficient when<br />it comes to warfare and that the freedoms of such societies are hindrance to the prosecution of said warfare, in fact :<br />  Democracy, and its twin of market capitalism, alone can instantaneously create lethal armies out of civilians, equip them with horrific<br />  engines of war, imbue them with a near-messianic zeal within a set time and place to exterminate what they understand as evil, have them<br />  follow to their deaths the most ruthless of men, and then melt anonymously back into the culture that produced them.  It is democracies,<br />  which in the right circumstances, can be imbued with the soul of battle, and thus turn the horror of killing to a higher purpose of saving<br />  lives and freeing the enslaved.<br />And what is &quot;the soul of battle&quot; to which he attributes such world-changing power? :<br />  A rare thing indeed that arises only when free men march unabashedly toward the heartland of their enemy in hopes of saving the<br />  doomed, when their vast armies are aimed at salvation and liberation not conquest and enslavement.  Only then does battle take on a<br />  spiritual dimension, one that defines a culture, teaches it what civic militarism is and how it is properly used.<br />Mr. Hanson thus provides the reader with an invaluable framework for understanding history, modern and ancient, and for understanding the<br />often underestimated strengths of democratic society.<br />Lest prospective readers dismiss the book as mere triumphalism, as some are wont to ignore Francis Fukuyama's The End of History, it<br />should, first of all, be noted that Mr. Hanson's portrayals of the three generals are absolutely riveting.  Most of us are familiar with Patton, at<br />least through the movie, and somewhat with Sherman, but the name Epaminondas summons forth little more than an old mildly racist folk<br />story.  Mr. Hanson restores him to his rightful place in the pantheon of democratic heroes, the destroyer of Spartan helotage, just as Sherman<br />helped destroy slavery and Patton helped destroy Nazism.  These men's stories would be worth reading if only because of the role each<br />played in the utter destruction of the abominable regimes of their time, but the idiosyncrasies and flamboyant aspects of their character, their<br />deep commitment to learning and to the craft of warfare, and their unusual understanding of the opportunity that their societies had afforded<br />them by granting them command of these armies, makes them truly fascinating to read about.  Particularly enjoyable is the way in which he<br />redeems each man against his more revered colleagues--Epaminondas vs. Pericles; Sherman vs. Lee; Patton vs. Bradley and<br />Eisenhower--showing that in their single-minded focus on the battle itself, each deserves greater credit than their more political, and more<br />self-interested rivals, and that, though each is considered bloodthirsty, in reality the very thoroughness with which they sought victory<br />ultimately saved lives.  Perhaps most importantly, Mr. Hanson helps us to see why democracies need such men, however politically<br />incorrect, even somewhat demented, their behavior may be at times.  A McLellan, a Marshall, an Eisenhower, a Colin Powell, is all well and<br />good for the bureaucratic function of running an army, but when it comes to inspiring men to fight, kill, and die, we must have Shermans<br />and Pattons and Schwartzkopfs to turn to in the field.<br />Nor is Mr. Hanson just saying that &quot;we win, because we're us&quot;.  He is equally good on the reasons that democracies (particularly America)<br />have failed in wars that do not follow the guidelines he lays out.  In Korea, where McArthur could not go after the Chinese; in Vietnam,<br />where we fought an entirely defensive war; in the Persian Gulf, where Schwarzkopf was not allowed to march to Baghdad, we not only<br />failed to win the wars, but needlessly prolonged the suffering of Koreans, Vietnamese, Iraqis and Americans.  In the end, the immediate<br />dealing of death would have been more humane than ever the seemingly moderate limitations proved to be.  And Mr. Hanson forces us to<br />ponder how much better a place the world might have been and how much misery might have been averted had Patton and Curtis LeMay<br />(under whose command Mr. Hanson's own father served) been given the free hand they desired to carry a liberationist war to Moscow.<br />Instead, as Patton protested :<br />  [T]in-soldier politicians in Washington have allowed us to kick hell out of one bastard and at the same time forced us to help establish a<br />  second one as evil or more evil than the first.<br />Out of these bitter experiences flow lessons that have special relevance to our own times.  For one, we would do well not to let people like<br />the radical Islamicists continue in the delusion that because we are a democracy we are an overripe fruit ready to fall and rot.  It is the nature<br />of our system that in times of peace we disarm to an almost absurd degree, but our unwillingness to spend money to keep up the armed<br />forces and our hesitancy to get involved abroad should not be confused with terminal helplessness.  As bin Laden has found out, to his likely<br />dismay, once provoked, we remain willing, even eager, to unleash a totally disproportionate level of lethality upon those who rile us.  On the<br />other hand, we would do well to remind ourselves that once moved to action there should be no surcease to the battle until we have entirely<br />rooted out the evil we face.  The most important lesson that Epaminondas, Sherman, and Patton have to teach us is that democratic brutality<br />turned against totalitarian evil, and carried to its ultimate conclusion, is capable of utterly destroying those malevolent systems.  The<br />measures we take may briefly trouble our consciences but they succeed brilliantly.  Having picked up the sword, we owe it to ourselves, and<br />even to the populace in the nations we oppose, not to set it down again until the job is done.<br />Mr. Hanson's book would make rewarding reading at any time, but it is especially applicable right now.

1710840:US	52173832	R2FDG4WOORCGHS	0439064864	398109329	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets	Books	5	5	5	N	N	chill guys, she's on our side	A great deal of angst has been expressed in the Christian press and amongst conservatives over the notion that the Harry Potter books <BR>sanction magic and are, by the very nature of the story, irreligious.  Though many commentators have had great fun with this worry, feeling <BR>that it somehow shows how fundamentally silly Christians are, I'm not inclined to dismiss it so quickly.  In a society in which Wicca has <BR>begun to be taken seriously as a belief system, even receiving IRS tax-exempt status, a parent has to be concerned about the possible effects <BR>on their child of such a phenomena as Harry Potter.  But a responsible parent who reads with their child and discusses the books and their <BR>themes presumably has no more need to worry about the witchcraft within them than have preceding generations of parents needed to lose <BR>sleep over the sorcery in The Lord of the Rings.  In fact, it's hard to escape the nagging feeling that most of us simply accept that Tolkien <BR>won't warp our kids because we know him to have been a devout Christian himself, and influential in converting C. S. Lewis, whose Narnia <BR>books are too explicitly Christian-themed to worry anyone.  Presumably, if J. K. Rowling were known to be religious (I've no idea whether <BR>she is or not), and outspoken about her beliefs, many of these concerns about her writings would likewise disappear.  But this is neither a <BR>realistic nor a productive standard to hold authors to; instead we should judge them by the moral message of their works.  By this standard, <BR>the Harry Potter books should give Christians, and religious parents of all stripes, reason to be grateful, not worried.<br />This is the case because Harry is a quintessential example of Man's struggle to choose between good and evil.  In fact, we've reached a point <BR>in our culture where the simple acknowledgments that Evil exists, that the propensity to behave in an evil manner is an essential aspect of <BR>Man's character, that Evil is seductive, and that we are susceptible too it--the bifurcated nature of Man which is the very basis of <BR>Judeo-Christianity and, thus, of our civilization--are in themselves conservative notions.  The political and spiritual philosophies of the Left <BR>are premised on a very different conception of Man, that he is fundamentally Good and that selfish, antisocial, and antihuman behaviors are <BR>products of external factors : of faulty social institutions; political oppression; or errant belief systems.  The Left believes that if all of these <BR>artificial accretions could be stripped away Man would return to his natural state of goodness.  J. K. Rowling obviously disagrees.<br />Famously, or at least it will be famous to anyone who's read the books, when Harry arrived at Hogwarts the Sorting Hat hesitated over what <BR>dorm to place him in.  Eventually he was assigned to Gryffindor, but the Hat also noted that he would fit in Slytherin, the dorm associated <BR>with Salazar Slytherin and the study of the Dark Arts.  Merely noting that the capacity for evil, as well as good, resides in Harry is unusual <BR>enough, but Rowling also makes it clear that Harry will be defined by the choices he makes between the two.  At the end of Chamber of <BR>Secrets, worried about his ability to tap into skills that are usually associated with Slytherin (like communicating with snakes [note the <BR>Biblical echo]), Harry confesses his self-doubt to Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts.  Harry wonders if he really should be in <BR>Slytherin :<br />    '[The Sorting Hat] only put me in Gryffindor,' said Harry in a defeated voice, 'Because I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .'<br />    'Exactly,' said Dumbledore, beaming once more. 'Which makes you very different from [Voldemort]. It is our choices, Harry, that show<BR>    what we truly are, far more than our abilities.' Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned.<br />Well might Harry, or any other modern child,be stunned by this revelation, that it is our moral choices in life that define who we are, that <BR>we bear the responsibility for who we become in life.  Adults hear this seldom enough, children almost never.  It is this message that makes <BR>the Harry Potter books so valuable to parents and makes their appeal to children such a welcome development.  Concerned parents--though <BR>they may obviously prefer that kids not be exposed to such themes in public schools, which antireligion activists have rendered so morally <BR>neutral and hostile to Christianity that they are incompetent to address them--should embrace the books, should read them with their kids, <BR>and, without sucking the fun out of them, should take advantage of the lessons that they teach.<br />Meanwhile, the popularity of the books suggests a genuine thirst among kids for the kind of moral clarity that they provide.  The Education <BR>establishment, the Left, and parents who leave such matters to the public schools to fulfill would do well to engage in some soul searching <BR>about the inadequacy of the moral education that the schools are apparently providing.  One approach that conservatives and Christians <BR>might take is to, quite disingenuously, suggest that just as these Wiccan novels have valuable non-religious lessons to teach, so might some <BR>of the great children's novels of the Christian tradition, like Swiss Family Robinson, which is usually horribly bowdlerized to strip it of <BR>religious themes.  Rather than trying to ban a worthwhile series of books, one which has kids reading enthusiastically, they should be used as <BR>a lever to get more good books into the curricula, to at least make sure that the same schools are reading Tolkien and Lewis and Madeleine <BR>L'Engle.  After all, what's good for the Wiccan goose is good for the Christian gander, right?<br />GRADE : A+	2002-01-02

And may they please forgive me for not<br />  having seen it all nor remembered it all, for not having divined it all.<br />  -Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Author's epigraph to The Gulag Archipelago<br />  It seemed as if it was no longer I who was writing; rather, I was swept along, my hand was being<br />  moved by an outside force, and I was only the firing pin attached to a spring.<br />  -Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Invisible Allies<br />It certainly helps that he looks like a figure out of the Old Testament, but Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's enduring image is likely to be that of the<br />prophet of the Soviet Union's doom.  No one, including Ronald Reagan, deserves more credit for making the West, and Russia itself, face<br />the fact that Communism was evil, that it had to be defeated, and that it was entirely possible to defeat it.  Where One Day in the Life of<br />Ivan Denisovich, his most widely read work, is a devastating portrait in miniature of the effects of Soviet oppression on one man, the<br />multi-volume Gulag Archipelago is the sprawling canvas upon which he depicts the entire vile system, sweeping across the decades since<br />1917 and touching upon every facet of society.  It is, in essence, the Prosecutor's indictment, stating the case against the enormous criminal<br />enterprise that was the U. S. S. R.  It's always seemed to me that the only document you can really compare it to is Martin Luther's 95<br />Theses.  It too represented a righteous and unanswerable rebuke to a seemingly invincible institution, served as a rallying point for reformers<br />and outright opponents, and ultimately contributed to wholesale changes in that institution (Reformation and Counter-Reformation of the<br />Catholic Church in one case, eventual demise in the case of the Soviet Union) which would have been nearly inconceivable in its absence.<br />The Gulag represents Solzhenitsyn's attempt to document nearly every phase of the Bolshevik's use of the police apparatus and prison camps<br />for the suppression of dissent, or suspected dissent.  Using a wide range of actual examples--many of them personal, others taken from<br />fellow prisoners he might while he was detained--he takes the reader step-by-step through the process of arrest, interrogation, conviction<br />(always conviction), transportation, and imprisonment.  One is prepared for a tone of righteous indignation and bitter irony, but I was<br />surprised to find here a kind of dark good humor.  Perhaps this is done for effect, Mr. Solzhenitsyn suggesting that the claims of criminality<br />upon which the authorities persecuted, and murdered, so many are worthy of only bemusement.  After all, what can be more dangerous to<br />absolute power than for people to greet it with contemptuous laughter?  Obviously nothing, since Mr. Solzhenitsyn was banished from the<br />Soviet Union on February 13, 1974, just two months after portions of this work began appearing in print in the West, after the KGB had<br />obtained a draft copy.  In all likelihood, Mr. Solzhenitsyn's life was only spared because he was already a Nobel Laureate by then, having<br />won the prize in 1970, though he was forbidden to travel outside the country at that time to accept it.<br />Besides offering a comprehensive Russian account of Soviet terror, Mr. Solzhenitsyn does something of extraordinary importance here, the<br />importance of which most in the West did not fully comprehend until after the collapse of the Soviet Union, if then : he drapes the crimes of<br />Communism around the neck of not just Stalin but of Lenin too, and traces the roots of the terror to the very philosophy of Communism<br />itself.  It had been a convenient myth for party members in the Soviet Union and fellow travelers here in that the Russian Revolution had<br />been a noble cause and an initial success that was gradually corrupted by the personal evil of just one man, Stalin.  True believers clung to<br />this idea both to justify their collaboration with the regime and to give themselves hope that the system could be reformed, to get it back on<br />its original track.  Mr. Solzhenitsyn began the process of yanking this prop out from under them, of demonstrating that the system was rotten<br />to its evil core, that no past actions were justified and no just future was possible.  In his excellent book, Lenin's Tomb, David Remnick<br />makes a convincing case that Gorbachev failed to understand this critique and its power, and failed to anticipate that it would be the central<br />feature of Glasnost, delegitimizing and destabilizing communism entire, whereas he expected only criticism of certain past leaders and<br />practices, which he could use to his own advantage.<br />In later years Mr. Solzhenitsyn would move on to an equally powerful criticism of the moral vacuousness and extreme individualism of the<br />West, earning him the loathing of Western intellectual elites.  Now, after the fall of the Soviet Union, he has become a harsh critic of the<br />new Russia, for its failure to return to its roots in Orthodox Christianity, earning him the enmity of Russian bureaucrats.  You would think<br />that folks might have learned that he is a prophet whose jeremiads you ignore at your own risk.<br />GRADE : A+True believers clung to <BR>this idea both to justify their collaboration with the regime and to give themselves hope that the system could be reformed, to get it back on <BR>its original track.

It is one of the more delicious ironies of American politics that the reforms that were foisted upon the Democrats in 1972 by liberal activists<br />trying to nominate a candidate of the Left, reforms which then spread to the Republican Party in the wake of the Watergate scandals, have<br />had the opposite effect that their advocates intended.  Loosening the powerbrokers grip on the nomination process has produced an<br />uninterrupted string of conservative Republican nominees and nearly thirty years of at least relatively conservative presidents, even though<br />Democrats have won three of those elections.  This is not, of course, how it was supposed to work.  The operating mythology held that it<br />was the evil men in the smoke-filled rooms who were forcing their reactionary minions down all of our throats, and, if only you could give<br />the people their choice, they'd go for progressives.  Well, those reformers would have done well to read Phyllis Schlafly's A Choice Not an<br />Echo, before setting in motion a process which they didn't understand, but which she had clearly, if over dramatically, explained back during<br />the 1964 campaign.<br />What Ms Schlafly set out to demonstrate--and she succeeded to a considerable degree--was that the Eastern Establishment of the Republican<br />Party, with its money, access to the media and advertising expertise, had for years wielded an inordinate influence over who would be the<br />eventual presidential nominee every four years.  At first blush this might seem to confirm the reformers intuition, but, as Ms Schlafly said,<br />what these men believed in was not conservative politics, as we understand it today, but their own rather large pocketbooks.  This led them<br />to favor stability, domestic and global, above all other causes, and meant that they were de facto defenders of the New Deal and relentless<br />advocates of d&eacute;tente with the Soviets.  Ideas were less important to them than not rocking the boat; the party line a distant second to the<br />bottom line.  In their own strange way, they had become allies of the Democratic Party, which by the early 1970s had taken the nation a long<br />way toward socialism at home, acceptance of communism as a legitimate system abroad, and an increasingly demoralized and relativistic<br />culture. Thus, the party paraded out a cavalcade of \\"me-tooers\\"--nominees like Wendell Wilkie, Tom Dewey, Eisenhower, and Nixon--who<br />had basically come to terms with the New Deal and were internationalist but not confrontationalist when it came to the Soviet Union.<br />Meanwhile, Eastern party powers did everything they could to deny the nomination to someone like Robert Taft, \\"Mr. Republican\\", who was<br />both isolationist and eager to roll back the Social Welfare State.<br />In this thin volume, Ms Schlafly argued that for Republicans to compete and win on the presidential level they would need to shuck off the<br />influence of the Easterners, the moneyed interests, and select truly conservative candidates who would draw sharp contrasts with the<br />Democrats, not try to fudge their differences.  When she first wrote the book it was to justify a Goldwater candidacy, and she rewrote it<br />somewhat later in 1964 to prepare Republicans for the vicious assault that she correctly predicted that Madison Avenue would launch against<br />him, with establishment Republicans in the East joining with Democrats to defeat a man who threatened both big government and the rather<br />stable balance of terror that was the Cold War.<br />In his terrific book, Before the Storm, Rick Perlstein has told the fascinating story of how the grassroots conservative movement managed, in<br />1964, to finally win the nomination for one of their own.  The victory was so unlikely that in places his book reads like a thriller.  Of course,<br />with LBJ riding a tidal wave of popular support in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, one could argue that the win wasn't worth much.<br />In fact, Goldwater went down to such ignominious defeat that it left many on the Left saying that conservatism had ceased to exist in<br />America.  Indeed, the Eastern Establishment had their way again in 1968 with the candidacy of Richard Nixon, who proceeded to expand<br />domestic government, bail out of Vietnam, buddy up to China, and pursue a policy of d&eacute;tente with the Soviet Union.  But then came the<br />McGovern reforms, and the post-Watergate reforms, and American politics has been drifting Right ever since.<br />In 1976 Ronald Reagan nearly knocked off a sitting president in the first relatively open GOP primaries, and the Democrats nominated a<br />born-again Southerner, Jimmy Carter, who did beat Ford.  Reagan came back and won in 1980, establishing what appeared to be a<br />Republican hammerlock on the presidency, but George Bush Sr. squandered that lock by raising taxes and alienating his conservative base.<br />This left him vulnerable to two other conservative Southerners, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, as, presumably for the first time in the history of<br />American politics, the Eastern establishment had no candidate at all to support, though they finally grudgingly went with Clinton as the least<br />conservative option.  Just two years later, in 1994, Ms Schlafly's thesis was brilliantly vindicated as Republicans ran on the starkly<br />ideological platform of the Contract with America and won a resounding victory, taking both houses of Congress for the first time in<br />decades.  Then in 2000, George W. Bush managed to defeat John McCain, the improbable darling of the establishment, in the primaries,<br />then proceeded to dethrone a sitting Vice President during an unprecedented economic boom.  (It is notable that Al Gore too was a<br />conservative Southerner, despite his bizarre lurch leftward during the fall campaign.)  Bush achieved these twin feats while running well to<br />the right of Ronald Reagan, who, though he undoubtedly would have liked to, never actually ran on a platform that called for privatizing<br />Social Security and turning over government services to \\"faith-based institutions\\".<br />Oddly enough, it is today Democrats who need their own Phyllis Schlafly (and isn't that a delicious prospect?) to come forward and summon<br />them back to their party principles.  Unless Democrats are content to be a party that periodically gets to put their own \\"me-tooer\\" in the<br />White House, a Democratic president who will govern like a Republican, then they need to offer \\"a choice not an echo.\\"  It is Democrats<br />who need to shake themselves loose from the thrall of the big corporate interests who have taken over their party and transformed them into<br />what Clinton himself realized they had become : \\"Eisenhower Republicans...fighting the Reagan Republicans\\".  They need to ask themselves<br />whether they exist solely to hold governmental power every once in a while, or whether they still have an organizing vision of the uses to<br />which that power should be put.<br />Congressional Republicans too should heed Ms Schlafly's sage advice and should borrow a page from their own playbook; in 2002 they<br />should run on a new Contract, one which differentiates them from Democrats in the most direct terms.  Too many of our politicians have<br />been mesmerized by the siren call of the media for bipartisanship, but as Ms Schlafly wrote, citing an unnamed Republican leader :<br />  Bipartisanship is just a $5 word for...a two-bit word, \\"me-tooism.\\"<br />Our politics is at its best when the two parties stake out their very different, nearly opposite, positions on the issues and then seek to<br />convince us, by force of argument, that one side or the other has the better platform for America...

1711553:US	52173832	R1X2HZDPSODND5	0141001763	855770597	Ravelstein (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)	Books	3	7	13	N	N	a Boswell unequal to his Johnson	Saul Bellow's affectionate roman a clef about the renowned professor Allan Bloom, author of the surprise bestseller The Closing of the<br />American Mind : How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students  (1987) (Allan Bloom<br />1930-1992), stirred up quite a ruckus, because it revealed to the public (it was apparently well known to his friends, students, and<br />colleagues) that Bloom was a homosexual who had died of AIDs, not liver failure has had been pronounced the cause of death.  Yet in the<br />novel, Bloom (Abe Ravelstein) specifically requires of Bellow (Chick) that he write a memoir of him when he is gone and since Ravelstein<br />is honest to a fault, especially with his friends, it's hard to imagine that Bloom would have objected to Bellow merely being truthful.  More<br />importantly, Bloom's homosexuality--well, really the early and unnecessary death that his homosexuality caused, ''destroyed by his reckless<br />sex habits&quot;, is how Chick puts it--is the mystery that lies at the core of the book.  There would be no tension to the book without it and<br />without our expectation that Bellow will eventually unravel the mystery, and the ultimate failure of the book is that he never does, perhaps<br />can not.<br />The Ravelstein who emerges in these pages is a fascinating figure : a physically large man; a mesmerizing pedagogue; a brilliant<br />conversationalist; mentor to many powerful political and academic players;  and, like Bellow's character Henderson, The Rain King, he is a<br />creature of wants, a man of enormous appetite for luxury.<br />  He took you from antiquity to the Enlightenment, and then-by way of Locke, Montesquieu, and Rousseau onward to Nietzsche,<br />  Heidegger-to the present moment, to corporate, high-tech America, its culture and its entertainments, its press, its educational system, its<br />  think tanks, its politics. He gave you a picture of this mass democracy and its characteristic-woeful-human product. In his classroom,<br />  and the lectures were always packed, he coughed, stammered, he smoked, bawled, laughed, he brought his students to their feet and<br />  debated, provoked them to single combat, examined, hammered them. He didn't ask, &quot;Where will you spend eternity?&quot; as religious<br />  the-end-is-near picketers did but rather, &quot;With what, in this modern democracy, will you meet the demands of your soul?&quot;<br />His conversations with Chick are much the best thing in the book, which loses steam whenever Ravelstein is not on scene.  The two share a<br />marvelous friendship, engaging each other on an elevated intellectual plane, much as Bloom described in his posthumous book, Love &amp;<br />Friendship, a plane upon which Ravelstein manifestly does not meet his soap opera addicted lover. As the novel ends, Chick says, &quot;You<br />don't easily give up a creature like Ravelstein to death.&quot;  The reader is likely to agree.<br />What are we to make then of this man who was so in love with life, who rejected the idea of eternity and so had nothing to hold on to but<br />life and thought and friendship, yet who in his personal behavior chose a self-destructive course, sacrificing all three to mere pleasures of the<br />flesh?  Bloom became famous, and quite rich, by telling us that American education, indeed the American mind, was being diminished by<br />the failure to study and engage with the great philosophers of the Western tradition.  The book made him a hero to conservatives and<br />anathema to the Left.  But what did he himself believe; what was his personal philosophy, or was his philosophy just that it was good to<br />study philosophy?<br />Here Bellow gives us a clue to the problem :<br />  Though I was his senior by some years he saw himself as my teacher.  Well, that was his trade--he was an educator.  He never presented<br />  himself as a philosopher--professors of philosophy were not philosophers.  He had  had a philosophical training and had learned how a<br />  philosophical life should be lived.  That was what philosophy was about, and this was why one read Plato.  If he had to choose between<br />  Athens and Jerusalem, among us the two main sources of higher life, he chose Athens, while full of respect for Jerusalem.  But in his last<br />  days it was the Jews he wanted to talk about, not the Greeks.<br />Yes, in the midst of one's life it may seem sufficient to think about all the big ideas, but shouldn't one also choose from among them and<br />create a moral structure for one's life?  As Ravelstein lies dying he does focus on the fact of his own Jewishness, as if, finally brought to the<br />brink of the void, he suddenly realizes the importance of the ethical life too.  But Bellow does not explore this any further.  Instead, after<br />Ravelstein's death he turns to his own near death experience, after eating some bad fish, and his struggle to write the book.<br />Throughout the book Ravelstein and Chick discuss Chick's lack of perception.  At one point Chick says :<br />  I do shut off my receptors sometimes and decide, somehow, not to see what there is to be seen.<br />The reader can't help wishing that Bellow had seen what was there to see.  It might have transformed a decent but minor book into an<br />excellent and important one, one that would explain how this exceptional man reconciled his atheism and his licentiousness with the<br />conservative impulse.  That it fails utterly in this task makes it a great disappointment.<br />GRADE : Cad  had a philosophical training and had learned how a<BR>    philosophical life should be lived.

1711964:US	52173832	R5ZX3JNRHETIA	0439064864	667539744	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets	Books	5	0	0	N	N	chill guys, she's on our side	A great deal of angst has been expressed in the Christian press and amongst conservatives over the notion that the Harry Potter books<br />sanction magic and are, by the very nature of the story, irreligious.  Though many commentators have had great fun with this worry, feeling<br />that it somehow shows how fundamentally silly Christians are, I'm not inclined to dismiss it so quickly.  In a society in which Wicca has<br />begun to be taken seriously as a belief system, even receiving IRS tax-exempt status, a parent has to be concerned about the possible effects<br />on their child of such a phenomena as Harry Potter.  But a responsible parent who reads with their child and discusses the books and their<br />themes presumably has no more need to worry about the witchcraft within them than have preceding generations of parents needed to lose<br />sleep over the sorcery in The Lord of the Rings.  In fact, it's hard to escape the nagging feeling that most of us simply accept that Tolkien<br />won't warp our kids because we know him to have been a devout Christian himself, and influential in converting C. S. Lewis, whose Narnia<br />books are too explicitly Christian-themed to worry anyone.  Presumably, if J. K. Rowling were known to be religious (I've no idea whether<br />she is or not), and outspoken about her beliefs, many of these concerns about her writings would likewise disappear.  But this is neither a<br />realistic nor a productive standard to hold authors to; instead we should judge them by the moral message of their works.  By this standard,<br />the Harry Potter books should give Christians, and religious parents of all stripes, reason to be grateful, not worried.<br />This is the case because Harry is a quintessential example of Man's struggle to choose between good and evil.  In fact, we've reached a point<br />in our culture where the simple acknowledgments that Evil exists, that the propensity to behave in an evil manner is an essential aspect of<br />Man's character, that Evil is seductive, and that we are susceptible too it--the bifurcated nature of Man which is the very basis of<br />Judeo-Christianity and, thus, of our civilization--are in themselves conservative notions.  The political and spiritual philosophies of the Left<br />are premised on a very different conception of Man, that he is fundamentally Good and that selfish, antisocial, and antihuman behaviors are<br />products of external factors : of faulty social institutions; political oppression; or errant belief systems.  The Left believes that if all of these<br />artificial accretions could be stripped away Man would return to his natural state of goodness.  J. K. Rowling obviously disagrees.<br />Famously, or at least it will be famous to anyone who's read the books, when Harry arrived at Hogwarts the Sorting Hat hesitated over what<br />dorm to place him in.  Eventually he was assigned to Gryffindor, but the Hat also noted that he would fit in Slytherin, the dorm associated<br />with Salazar Slytherin and the study of the Dark Arts.  Merely noting that the capacity for evil, as well as good, resides in Harry is unusual<br />enough, but Rowling also makes it clear that Harry will be defined by the choices he makes between the two.  At the end of Chamber of<br />Secrets, worried about his ability to tap into skills that are usually associated with Slytherin (like communicating with snakes [note the<br />Biblical echo]), Harry confesses his self-doubt to Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts.  Harry wonders if he really should be in<br />Slytherin :<br />  '[The Sorting Hat] only put me in Gryffindor,' said Harry in a defeated voice, 'Because I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .'<br />  'Exactly,' said Dumbledore, beaming once more. 'Which makes you very different from [Voldemort]. It is our choices, Harry, that show<br />  what we truly are, far more than our abilities.' Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned.<br />Well might Harry, or any other modern child, be stunned by this revelation, that it is our moral choices in life that define who we are, that<br />we bear the responsibility for who we become in life.  Adults hear this seldom enough, children almost never.  It is this message that makes<br />the Harry Potter books so valuable to parents and makes their appeal to children such a welcome development.  Concerned parents--though<br />they may obviously prefer that kids not be exposed to such themes in public schools, which antireligion activists have rendered so morally<br />neutral and hostile to Christianity that they are incompetent to address them--should embrace the books, should read them with their kids,<br />and, without sucking the fun out of them, should take advantage of the lessons that they teach.<br />Meanwhile, the popularity of the books suggests a genuine thirst among kids for the kind of moral clarity that they provide.  The Education<br />establishment, the Left, and parents who leave such matters to the public schools to fulfill would do well to engage in some soul searching<br />about the inadequacy of the moral education that the schools are apparently providing.  One approach that conservatives and Christians<br />might take is to, quite disingenuously, suggest that just as these Wiccan novels have valuable non-religious lessons to teach, so might some<br />of the great children's novels of the Christian tradition, like Swiss Family Robinson, which is usually horribly bowdlerized to strip it of<br />religious themes.  Rather than trying to ban a worthwhile series of books, one which has kids reading enthusiastically, they should be used as<br />a lever to get more good books into the curricula, to at least make sure that the same schools are reading Tolkien and Lewis and Madeleine<br />L'Engle.  After all, what's good for the Wiccan goose is good for the Christian gander, right?<br />GRADE : A+be stunned by this revelation, that it is our moral choices in life that define who we are, that <BR>we bear the responsibility for who we become in life.

One can<br />sympathize with, or at least understand, all these men's shared reluctance to fully embrace the conservative logic of their own writings, and<br />their residual need to demonstrate to their old comrades on the Left that drifting Right hasn't made them uncaring, but this hesitancy does<br />diminish each of their books.<br />In Mr. Sleeper's case, he starts from a very basic and astute observation :<br />  [L]iberal racism patronizes nonwhites by expecting (and getting) less of them than they are fully capable of achieving.  Intending to turn<br />  the tables on racist double standards that set the bar much higher for nonwhites, liberal racism ends up perpetuating double standards by<br />  setting the bar so much lower for its intended beneficiaries that it denies them the satisfactions of equal accomplishment and opportunity.<br />He proceeds to deliver chapter and verse indicating that this is the case : from an excellent demonstration of how the 1964 Voting Rights Act<br />was perverted into a way of guaranteeing a few seats for black Congressmen; to an explanation of how \\"root causes\\" excuses for criminal<br />behavior and opposition to vigorous law enforcement had helped to make places like New York City more dangerous for blacks, until Rudy<br />Guliani came along and ignored both; to a devastating indictment of the NY Times and its racial politics, both as it plays out in politically<br />correct company policy and as it functions to distort the paper's news coverage; to a depiction of how Alex Haley's novel Roots helped<br />create a false African consciousness in black America, which has gradually created an unhealthy distance between blacks and the Western<br />values they need to succeed in this culture.<br />In all of these instances, liberals (black and white) have sought to explain away black underachievment as a phenomenon whose sole cause<br />is white racism and whose only solution lies in government action (i.e., white benevolence).  Even setting aside the question of whether<br />racism is really this powerful and is still pervasive, framing the situation in this way can only harm blacks : by removing incentives for<br />self-improvement, since government aid is promised for every ill; by lowering self-esteem, since all progress will be a result of government<br />(Liberal) intercession; and, by imposing artificial limits, such as the Congressional scheme, which packed gerrymandered districts with black<br />voters, thereby gaining black Representatives while diminishing black power in all the surrounding districts.<br />So far, Mr. Sleeper is right on the money.  But when he moves beyond the critique he gets himself in trouble, because his stated intent is an<br />impossibility :<br />  This book's premise is that precisely because the United States is becoming racially, ethnically, and religiously more complex than<br />  institutional color-coding can comprehend, liberals should be working overtime to nurture some shared American principles and bonds<br />  that strengthen national belonging and nourish democratic habits.<br />He seems oblivious to the fact that the project he's set himself is to make Liberalism into Conservatism.  For Liberalism's very raison d'être<br />is to remove societal inequalities via government action, to force egalitarianism down our throats at the cost of our freedom.  You see, the<br />dirty little secret that Mr. Sleeper does not allow himself to face is that you could just replace \\"black\\" with \\"poor\\" in the entire prior analysis<br />and leave most of the rest of his argument unchanged.  It is a mere sad circumstance of American history and our unfortunate legacy of<br />slavery and Jim Crow that so many blacks are part of the underclass.  Liberalism may focus on them in particular, but it patronizes, and<br />thereby debilitates, all of the poor.  Liberalism always resorts to government action, always excuses social pathologies as not the fault of the<br />perpetrators, always blames oppression for inequalities, always asks (and expects) little of those it claims to serve, while promising much.<br />Small wonder that the epoch of Liberalism (1929-1980, in other words, from the Depression to the election of Ronald Reagan) turned the<br />poor into dependents of the Welfare State.<br />That said though, Mr. Sleeper is right when he suggests that the appropriate alternative to this kind of ineffectual patronizing and<br />counterproductive governmental meddling is a restoration of civil society, of non-governmental social organizations, of family, church,<br />community, etc., structured around common traditional values and standards of behavior.  Central to all of this is a revival of the ethos of<br />personal responsibility, combined with a sense of communal obligation.  We, all of us, need to stop depending on government and seeking<br />excuses for our own shortcomings.  We need to learn once again how to rely on ourselves and how to provide for those around us.<br />Meanwhile, Liberalism, as Mr. Sleeper says, deserves great credit for its role in the fight against institutionalized racism in America (forty<br />years ago) , but as he quotes Thurgood Marshall as saying :<br />  The law can open doors and knock down walls, but it cannot build bridges.<br />For America to fulfill its own purpose, it was vital to include all our citizens in a society of opportunity, to allow them the freedom to make<br />what they can out of their own lives without any interference due to race, creed, or color.  We can, and must, make the law colorblind, so<br />that each of us is judged only by what Martin Luther King, Jr. called \\"the content of our character\\", but as Justice Marshall suggested,<br />government isn't capable of removing the prejudices in each of our hearts.  To achieve that entirely commendable goal we will require a<br />healthy civil society, one that builds character, one in which we are individually free but mutually dependent and where government is only<br />a last resort.

The authors provide really fascinating accounts of four post-Cold War negotiations--nuclear arms proliferation talks between<br />the U.S. and North Korea; the Israeli-Palestinian talks leading to the Oslo Accords; the creation of the Gulf War coalition (1991); and the<br />confrontation between the US (and Europe) and Serbia that led to the Dayton Peace Accords--that each resulted, in their view, in some kind<br />of major breakthrough, some difficult to achieve result.  These accounts are based on what must have been extensive interviews with key<br />players, who are quoted frequently and who share the concerns and concepts that influenced them.  The book would be worthwhile even if<br />all it contained were these detailed, often thrilling, narratives of several significant recent foreign policy conflicts.<br />But, in addition, these four negotiations provide the authors with the jump off points for extensive discussions of the personalities involved<br />and the tactics they used.  The book is published by the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, and in many ways it represents an<br />attempt to bring the Socratic method out of the class room and on to the written page.  In parenthetical asides they ask the reader to consider<br />why certain players took certain actions or how a key decision may have influenced the whole course of events, etc..  As you read, the<br />authors are virtually present, pushing and prodding (in a helpful way) to make sure that you are conscious of the negotiating ploys that<br />participants utilize.<br />Meanwhile, in their own analysis of events, they spell out the four core concepts of what they call \\"breakthrough negotiation\\" :<br />  (1) Diagnosing structure<br />  (2) Identifying barriers to agreement<br />  (3) Managing conflict<br />  (4) Building momentum<br />and seven principles that guide breakthrough negotiators :<br />  (1) Breakthrough Negotiators Shape the Structure of Their Situations<br />  (2) Breakthrough Negotiators Organize to Learn<br />  (3) Breakthrough Negotiators are Masters of Process Design<br />  (4) Breakthrough Negotiators Foster Agreement When Possible But Employ Force When Necessary<br />  (5) Breakthrough Negotiators Anticipate and Manage Conflict<br />  (6) Breakthrough Negotiators Build Momentum Toward Agreement<br />  (7) Breakthrough Negotiators Lead from the Middle<br />They use innumerable examples to illustrate these concepts and principles and the overall structure certainly provides a framework that<br />would be useful to anyone involved in negotiations.  In this regard, they have produced what will likely be an excellent textbook for use in<br />the classroom.<br />So far so good; but the book also seems to be at least partially intended for a wider audience, and here it runs into some difficulties, largely<br />as a result of the textbook format and of the choice of geopolitical negotiations as a subject matter.  As a threshold matter, I don't believe<br />that these negotiations between nation states hold terribly many lessons for business executives, who are presumably a significant portion of<br />the intended wider audience, because one or both of the participants in these cases usually lack the option of just ending the negotiation, an<br />option which is almost always available in the business setting.  Coca-Cola can simply decide not to buy Joe's Cola and can walk away, but<br />Serbia can't really ignore the United States and Western Europe.  No businessman, not even a Bill Gates, is ever likely to have the<br />overwhelming leverage that the U.S. brings to the negotiating table.<br />The biggest problem though is that if you applythe first of the authors' own core concepts (diagnosing structure) to their chosen four<br />examples you see that the breakthrough generally occurred prior to, or at, the moment negotiations started.  Thus, the actual content of the<br />Oslo Accords was pretty much insignificant; what really mattered was the implicit admission by the parties that Israel and a Palestinian state<br />were each realities that the other side needed to cope with.  Even today, with the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians at its all<br />time nadir, they are relatively close to a final accord.  Israel will eventually declare a Palestinian state unilaterally and the Palestinians will<br />be forced to accept the boundaries that Israel imposes.  The breakthrough occurred with Oslo when the two sides, just by entering<br />negotiations, acknowledged each others existence as a political fact.<br />(...)<br />Mind you, the authors are so thorough, insightful, and honest that they do discuss many of these issues, even if only tangentially, and they<br />are forthright in depicting \\"breakthrough negotiators\\" as those folks (Richard Holbrooke and James Baker, for example) who keep their eye<br />on the big picture and don't get distracted by the particulars of agreements.

I had a habit of following my wife.<br />  -Tony Horwitz, Baghdad Without a Map<br />Tony Horwitz has a pretty good shtick going; he follows his journalist wife (Geraldine Brooks) from assignment to assignment, across<br />the globe, and then wangles freelance assignments in the new locale.  In the meantime, he's produced three excellent books set in these<br />widely varied ports of call : One for the Road relates his adventures hitchhiking through the Australian Outback; Confederates in the<br />Attic is a very amusing account of Civil War reenactors in the American South; and Baghdad Without a Map takes him through the<br />Middle East in the year or so just prior to the 1991 Gulf War.<br />At a time when all of us are scurrying around trying to figure out what makes the Arab world so much different than the West, Horwitz<br />is an excellent guide.  Whether listening to Egyptians denigrate Gulf Arabs (&quot;The Gulfies had oil but they didn't have a civilization to<br />rival that of Egyptians, who were tossing up pyramids five thousand years before the Gulfies moved out of goat-hair tents&quot;); getting<br />whacked on qat, the narcotic leaf that is the national passion of Yemen; or describing the oppressive atmosphere of Iraq--he compares<br />entering Iraq to &quot;walking through the gate of a maximum-security prison&quot;--Horwitz always manages to both make us laugh and scare the<br />bejeezus out of us.  His portrait of the region is one of unrelenting paranoia on the part of the Islamic world.  The title of the book refers<br />to the fact that no maps are available in Iraq, because Saddam is afraid to share such basic geographic information with potential<br />enemies (which, of course, includes everyone), and, if that's not enough, even the weather there is classified information.<br />All of this though is mere prelude to the fascinating, but frightening, closing section of the book, in which Mr. Horwitz and his wife<br />travel to Iran to attend the funeral of the Ayatollah Khomeni, along with what may well, as he suggests, have been the largest crowd of<br />people ever assembled in human history.  This event turned deadly, with literally millions of crazed mourners crushing each other, then<br />devolved into bizarre spectacle, with the faithful tearing apart the dead imam's corpse.  But even here, with religious frenzy at its worst,<br />Mr. Horwitz offers this nearly surreal exchange :<br />  One of the demonstrators peeled off to rest by the curb, and I edged over to ask him what the mourners were shouting.<br />  'Death to America,' he said.<br />  'Oh.'

Conservatives only<br />diminish themselves when they sing hossanas to any Leftist who switches sides (like Norman Podhoretz in an earlier time), making it<br />seem that in order to take themselves seriously they need a patina of approval from intellectual elites.  On the other hand, Mr. Hitchens<br />is pretty much the poster child for the old saying : you'd rather have him in the tent whizzing out, than outside whizzing in.  Mr.<br />Hitchens argues so forcefully and is published so widely (who else could possibly place essays in The Nation, The Guardian, National<br />Review, and The Wall Street Journal), that there must be something comforting for any politico who finds himself, however<br />temporarily, agreeing with Mr. Hitchens instead of opposing him.<br />Pity poor Bill Clinton then, who had the misfortune to play Emperor to Mr. Hitchens little boy, leading to an eight year gavotte in which<br />Mr. Clinton hid behind a bevy of liberal flacks, willing to engage in misdirection, lying, and character assassination for him, while Mr.<br />Hitchens, nearly alone on the Left, used every venue at his disposal to alert the world to the Emperor's lack of clothes.  All the<br />President's men had little trouble portraying conservative critics as partisans, but Mr. Hitchens's attacks are not so easily dismissed.  Nor<br />is the Hitchens thesis a terribly welcome one for the Right.  For what Mr. Hitchens argues, always vociferously and often compellingly,<br />is that not only was Bill Clinton personally corrupt, he also governed as a Republican.  To Mr. Hitchens this is just one more reason to<br />loathe him, but for many conservatives the thought is just too awful to contemplate.<br />The basic case that Mr. Hitchens builds on the legislative front includes the Clinton Administration's acquiescence in such Republican<br />policies as Welfare Reform, balanced budgets, don't ask-don't tell, killing Health Care reform, etc.  He relates a story about writing an<br />essay for Dissent in 1996 that referred to Clinton as the lesser of two evils (presumably less evil than Bob Dole), which led to the<br />following exchange with the magazine's editor :<br />  ...Michael Walzer inquired plaintively : 'Why is it that some people on the Left seem to hate Bill Clinton!'  I thought then, and I<br />  think even more now, that they mystery lies elsewhere.  Why do so many people on the Right hate Bill Clinton?<br />Setting aside the fact, which Mr. Hitchens may genuinely not comprehend, that conservatives actually take character seriously, he does<br />have a point as regards Mr. Clinton's general surrender on the core provisions of the Contract with America.  And assuming, as the<br />media and the Democrats were so fond of telling us, that the Republican class of '94 was the most rabidly Right-wing gang of vandals<br />ever to stride the halls of Congress, then the degree to which the President accepted their platform would tend to suggest that he should<br />be viewed as a conservative figure himself.<br />At any rate, that's Mr. Hitchen's take on things, and freed of any political stake in Mr. Clinton's presidency and legacy, the author lays<br />into him with obvious relish, mincing no words about the long record of sexual assaults and subsequent intimidation of the victims that<br />trailed the President from Arkansas to the Oval Office.<br />The whole mess is ripe for attack (what the Pentagon would call a target rich environment) and Mr. Hitchens wades in with the zeal of a<br />true believer and the gusto of a gifted polemicist.  The book is rather underwritten and contains some glaring errors (like reducing Jackie<br />Robinson's career to three years), but there's genius in the way he's framed his argument, in that it requires those who defend Bill<br />Clinton to face the way in which his lack of moral character, as evinced in his criminal behavior and duplicity, parallels his lack of<br />public character,  enabling him to shuck off liberal campaign promises (and, theoretically, beliefs) and embrace conservative programs,<br />so long as they furthered his own career.  The \\"Triangulation\\" of the subtitle is, of course, the strategy that Dick Morris came up with,<br />whereby Mr. Clinton treated both Democrats and Republicans as partisan goons, with himself as the reasonable, caring, selfless servant<br />of the public, stuck in the middle.  Mr. Hitchens is, rightly, appalled that the American Left, of which he is a leading member, allowed<br />itself to be used in such a self-serving manner by Bill Clinton.

The assignment literally changed my life. Once I began to work on the article I realized that here was<br />  a subject that needed all the attention, and more, that I could give to it. Although I had been completely unaware of it, there was in<br />  existence a whole literature that denied that the ancient Greeks were the inventors of democracy, philosophy, and science. There were<br />  books in circulation that claimed that Socrates and Cleopatra were of African descent, and that Greek philosophy had actually been<br />  stolen from Egypt. Not only were these books being read and widely distributed; some of these ideas were being taught in schools<br />  and even in universities.<br />  Ordinarily, if someone has a theory which involves a radical departure from what the experts have professed, he is expected to defend<br />  his position by providing evidence in its support. But no one seemed to think it was appropriate to ask for evidence from the<br />  instructors who claimed that the Greeks stole their philosophy from Egypt.<br />  -Mary Lefkowitz, Not Out of Africa<br />One is torn by two competing emotions in reading Not Out of Africa.  On the one hand, there's the visceral thrill of watching idiotic<br />ideas get an old-fashioned butt-whipping.  But, on the other hand, there's something poignant about the need of black scholars to claim<br />the accomplishments of the Greeks and Egyptians as their own.  It is very nearly painful to watch the ease with which Ms Lefkowitz<br />disposes of the lunatic ideas that make up Afrocentrism, though she deserves great credit for taking them seriously enough to lay them<br />out systematically, and demonstrating that they actually do have ancient sources,  before annihilating them.  Still, as you near the end of<br />the book, the contest has been so uneven that it's natural to wonder if this bloodbath was really necessary.<br />However, in her conclusion, Ms Lefkowitz makes the case for why it is necessary to utterly destroy Afrocentrism, and here she is<br />equally persuasive.  Her reasons are as follows :<br />  (1)  By claiming European civilization as a product of Africans, Afrocentrism has the perverse effect of making blacks responsible<br />  for the culture which justified their enslavement and oppression for centuries.<br />  (2)  By focussing solely on the achievements of the Egyptians, Afrocentrism fails to consider genuinely black African cultures, like<br />  that of Nubia.<br />  (3)  By teaching black students that white Europeans stole their culture, Afrocentrism fosters racial animosity.<br />  (4)  Afrocentrism is not only antihistorical it is also antiscientific--denying genetic, archaeological, linguistic, and other forms of<br />data.<br />  (5)  It wastes precious educational time; the time that students spend learning the lies of Afrocentrism is time that they are not<br />  spending learning the truth.<br />And she closes with a very strong statement :<br />  Students of the modern world may think it is a matter of indifference whether or not Aristotle stole his philosophy from Egypt.  They<br />  may believe that even if the story is not true, it can be used to serve a positive purpose.  But the question, and many others like it,<br />  should be a matter of serious concern to everyone, because if you assert that he did steal his philosophy, you are prepared to ignore or<br />  to conceal a substantial body of historical evidence that proves the contrary.  Once you start doing that, you can have no scientific or<br />  even social-scientific discourse, nor can you have a community, or a university.<br />That's pretty bracing stuff, but it cuts to the quick : are we truly prepared to sacrifice our universities and our students on the altar of<br />political correctness, self esteem, andmulticultural hogwash?  One would certainly hope not, and we can only thank Ms Lefkowitz for<br />having the courage to take on the racially charged task of confronting these issues head on.

[In] this very funny book by P. J. O'Rourke, he sets out to test<br />big government liberalism by seeing how it is playing out in the real world, on a series of issues : overpopulation, famine, ecological<br />disaster, ethnic hatred, plague and poverty.  For making this effort to scientifically test the ideology of the Left, in the laboratory of<br />reality, he has been accused of practically fabricating the issues in order to shoot down their solutions.  If only....<br />It is all enjoyable and a ringing vindication of free markets, limited government and American culture (circa 1950), but far and away the<br />best chapter is the overpopulation one where he compares that perennial favorite of the Paul Ehrlich crowd, Bangladesh, with Fremont,<br />CA.  Why Fremont?  How about, because they have roughly the same population density.  By the time Mr. O'Rourke is done, the very<br />notion that population growth, in the abstract, is something that we have to be terrified of has been rendered utterly laughable (and laugh<br />you will).  Also worth the price of admission, before its author totally fades into obscurity, is the evisceration of Al Gore's deranged<br />magnum opus, Earth in the Balance.  Mr. O'Rourke delivers Mr. Gore a well deserved drubbing.<br />The book makes a fine companion piece to Parliament of Whores, sort of a foreign affairs version of the same tale.

But if you want to understand the<br />real key to its success, you need look no further than the structure of the story and the name of the protagonist, William of Baskerville.<br />Though Eco claims that while he was writing the book he actually referred to William as William of Ockham, it seems implausible that<br />he did not realize all along that he was simply transplanting Sherlock Holmes to a medieval monastery.  After all, he even gave William<br />an overly innocent sidekick and awestruck narrator, in the form of Adso of Melk, an old man now who relates the series of events he<br />witnessed back in 1327.<br />The story then proceeds like the best of the Sherlock Holmes imitations (sort of a medieval Seven Percent Solution) and adds in<br />elements of the gothic thriller.  Combine these sure fire formulas with a sufficiently intellectual patina to make us feel like we're reading<br />real &quot;literature&quot; and you've got an odds on recipe for a hit.  There are quite probably a number of other levels on which the book can be<br />read and Mr. Eco is assuredly trying to accomplish other things, but the fact remains, it works quite well as a garden variety mystery,<br />and that's how almost all of its readers have likely understood it.<br />GRADE : B+<br />N. B.

However, the theories he does expound<br />are so absurd or obtuse--hard to tell which--that I now assume that it is merely a hoax.  His failure to even acknowledge his debt to Sir<br />Arthur Conan Doyle renders everything else he has to say more than somewhat suspect.<br />Perhaps the point of the novel really is as simple as he says early on in this postscript :<br />  I felt like poisoning a monk.<br />Mindful of at least the possibility that he's being serious in this admission and of the fact that the novel concerns a series of characters<br />who are killed by their own literary curiosity perhaps it is best that we delve no further.to say more than somewhat suspect.<br />Perhaps the point of the novel really is as simple as he says early on in this postscript :<br />    I felt like poisoning a monk.<br />Mindful of at least the possibility that he's being serious in this admission and of the fact that the novel concerns a series of characters <BR>who are killed by their own literary curiosity perhaps it is best that we delve no further.	2001-12-03

Fullerton's series relates the adventures of a British naval family, the Everards, during WWI :<br />Nicholas, a sub-lieutenant on a destroyer, who earned a reputation for insubordination as a midshipmen; his brother David, the favored<br />elder son; and their uncle, Hugh, who commands a battleship.  In this first installment, all three end up at the Battle of Jutland, which is<br />entirely plausible because of the number of ships that were involved.<br />It is, of course, unfair to measure Fullerton against the impossibly high standard set by O'Brian and C. S. Forester.  But, taken on its<br />own terms, I found the action of the book somewhat confusing.  As the author cuts from one character to the next, without any chapter<br />heading or other notation to orient the reader, it is difficult at times to figure out just which character we're with.  This becomes<br />particularly bothersome in the midst of the battle, especially when one ship is sunk and another seems to be going down; there were<br />several times when I thought the second ship had gone down too because of the way the action shifted.  On the other hand, Nick, who is<br />the real focus of the story, is a likable enough hero.  Also, the book serves as a welcome reminder that some significant portions of<br />WWI were waged at sea; whereas we tend to focus entirely, or almost entirely, on the bloody trench warfare that occurred on land.<br />This is an acceptable maiden voyage--good enough to make us look forward to reading the succeeding volumes--but they'll need to<br />improve quickly.<br />GRADE : Cthat occurred on land.<br />This is an acceptable maiden voyage--good enough to make us look forward to reading the succeeding volumes--but they'll need to<br />improve quickly.<br />GRADE : C	2001-12-03

Did He have no notion of fair<br />  and unfair?  Couldn't He read a simple balance sheet?  He would have been sacked long ago if He<br />  were managing a corporation, the things Hew allowed to happen....<br />  -A Fine Balance<br />Suppose that you were reading a novel about the struggle of a group of people on the margins (economic, racial, religious margins) of society in Hitler's Berlin or<br />Stalin's Moscow, a novel written by a refugee; you wouldn't expect a particularly happy ending would you ?  But somehow, even though Rohinton Mistry is a<br />Parsi refugee from India, who moved to Canada in 1975 when Indira Ghandi declared a State of Emergency and assumed sweeping powers, we just aren't<br />prepared for the moment when his narrative of life in Indira's India turns truly dark.  This really says more about our political naivet&eacute; when it comes to the<br />Third World than it does about his plotting technique or his writing style.  I suspect that for most readers, and I know it was true of me, there's a sense that<br />oppressive totalitarianism is really only a tragedy when it drags a developed Western nation back down into barbarism--that for underdeveloped nations, such<br />murderous misrule is pretty much the normal state of things.  Perhaps there's even some lingering imperialistic, racist feeling that such backwards peoples are<br />not capable of imposing the kind of all-encompassing, soul-killing, dictatorship that we find so horrifying when they descend on a Western populace, or that<br />these long abused peoples, unused to freedom, can not feel its absence as profoundly as do we.  Rohinton Mistry disabuses us of such notions, quite forcefully.<br />A Fine Balance is set in an unnamed Indian city--I guess it's supposed to be Bombay--in 1975.  It centers around the unlikely living arrangements of four<br />characters who are forced by their strained economic circumstances to share an apartment.  Dina Dilal is a widower who has spent her life trying to escape her<br />abusive and domineering brother, in a society where independent women are, to say the least, not the norm.  The apartment represents her attempt to maintain<br />her freedom, but she can not afford the rent on her own.  She is first convinced to take in a fellow Parsi as a boarder, Maneck Kohlah, whose parents have sent<br />him to the city from his beloved Himalayan hill country so that he can earn a degree.  Then she hires two tailors to do piece work, Hindus whom she allows to<br />live in the apartment : Ishvar Darji and his seventeen-year-old nephew, Omprakash.  Ishvar is devoted to the task of finding his brother's son a wife.<br />Despite their disparate backgrounds, the four develop into something like a family, as they lean on each other in the face of financial hardship, personal troubles,<br />and political turmoil.  The lives of a cast of colorful characters--including the local Beggarmaster, a guilt ridden rent collector, a hair collector who takes his<br />work a tad too seriously, and even a litter of nearly feral cats--become intertwined with those of the principles, providing an unusually detailed and richly<br />textured portrait of a community of the urban poor.<br />But inevitably, or seemingly inevitably, events eventually catch up to the little group and the centripetal force of their affection for one another proves no much<br />for the centrifugal force of a society that offers little or no economic opportunity, no real prospects for single women, discriminates against religious minorities,<br />and is embarked on a genuinely evil campaign of mass sterilizations of unwilling citizens.  All of these forces come to bear on the apartment dwellers in ways<br />that range from the merely sad to the truly horrific.  Considering how touching are some of the earlier scenes of the group bonding, and how hopeful are their<br />dreams, the transition to tragedyis definitely jarring.  But what real alternative does Mistry have ?  Such were, and one fears still are, the realities of life in<br />post-Raj India.<br />The book is so ineffably sad that it seems only fair to caution readers that they may find it too heartbreaking.  On the other hand, simply to the extent that it<br />brings us face to face with the brutalities of which such supposedly progressive governments as Indira Ghandi's are capable, and depicts just how intolerable life<br />in these societies can be, it serves an invaluable purpose.  It amply demonstrates that native rule is no panacea for the ills of the Third World and helps us to<br />understand why refugees from these countries continue to seek a better life in America, long after their colonial masters have left them, seemingly, in control of<br />their own fates.  In the end, it avails the oppressed naught that their oppressors may share a skin color : it is ideas--such as freedom; and equality under the law;<br />and opportunity--which really matter and which provide the setting in which people, such as those so lovingly portrayed here, can maintain their balance and<br />realize their dreams.<br />GRADE : A-al alternative does Mistry have ?

Huntington's notion of a &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot;, Robert D. Kaplan's theory of a &quot;Coming Anarchy&quot;, and Benjamin<br />Barber's juxtaposition of &quot;Jihad vs. McWorld.&quot;  As discussed in earlier reviews, the first two, though problematic, seem to have some<br />legitimacy, but the third, Barber's, is only accurate to the extent that it is misunderstood.  If by &quot;McWorld&quot; Barber meant the liberal<br />democratic capitalist nations of the West and meant by &quot;Jihad&quot; the totalitarian nations of Islam, then the image of these two worlds being<br />in conflict would be true.  However, he means something quite different, and he is quite wrong.<br />Barber's main concern is with something that he refers to as &quot;participatory democracy&quot; or &quot;civil society&quot;, a kind of political system in<br />which each individual takes an active role in nearly every decision of government.  He sees both Jihad and McWorld as threats to this<br />system, Jihad because it represents a cultural sectarianism &quot;rooted in race&quot; which :<br />  ...holds out the grim prospect of a retribalization of large swaths of humankind by war and bloodshed: a threatened balkanization of<br />  nation-states in which culture is pitted against culture, people against people, tribe against tribe, a Jihad in the name of a hundred<br />  narrowly conceived faiths against every kind of interdependence, every kind of artificial social cooperation and mutuality: against<br />  technology, against pop culture, and against integrated markets; against modernity itself as well as the future in which modernity<br />  issues.<br />McWorld because it represents :<br />  ...onrushing economic, technological, and ecological forces that demand integration and uniformity and that mesmerize peoples<br />  everywhere with fast music, fast computers, and fast food--MTV, Macintosh, and McDonald's--pressing nations into one homogenous<br />  global theme park, one McWorld tied together by communications, information, entertainment, and commerce.<br />In essence then, Jihad is a threat because it overemphasizes our differences; McWorld is a threat because it eliminates those differences.<br />Never mind the fact that the U.S., where McWorld is most advanced, would seem to have ample diversity as it ranges from Anchorage<br />to Honolulu to New Orleans to Miami to New York City to Boston, perhaps the oddest aspect of Barber's whole analysis is that, while<br />he dislikes both, he actually favors Jihad over McWorld.  He does so because he thinks that the peoples of Jihad are at least likely to be<br />actively involved in their cultures, while the people of McWorld have become nothing more than passive consumers.  But, at any rate,<br />Mr. Barber is less concerned with the clash between these two systems than he is with the clash between each of them and the<br />participatory democracy that he thinks we should have instead of either.<br />There are so many problems with Mr. Barber's understanding of the world that it is hard to know where to begin and impossible to<br />address them all, but we'll try to take on a few of the bigger misconceptions.  It may be that his biggest mistake is to view Jihad and<br />McWorld as anti-democratic forces when, in fact, they are precisely the aspects of democracy which conservatives have for so long<br />warned about.  As far as Jihad, or sectarianism, is concerned, the Founders quite consciously set up a representative, rather than a direct,<br />democracy, with extensive checks and balances and express limitations on the power of government, in order to protect minorities from<br />what they well understood would otherwise be a tendency of the majority to impose its own ideologies and practices on unwilling<br />dissenters.<br />Equallyimportant, but less well understood,  is the conservative tradition of criticizing democratic capitalism, not because it won't work,<br />which is the Left's view, but because it will work so well that unless we cultivate other facets of the culture, the great mass of people<br />will decline into a comfortable but meaningless affluence.  It was the great Albert Jay Nock who perhaps put this best when he said :<br />  [Edmund] Burke touches [the] matter of patriotism with a searching phrase.  'For us to love our country,' he said, 'our country ought<br />  to be lovely.'  I have sometimes thought that here may be the rock on which Western civilization will finally shatter itself.<br />  Economism can build a society which is rich, prosperous, powerful, even one which has a reasonably wide diffusion of material<br />  well-being.  It can not build one which is lovely, one which has savour and depth, and which exercises the irresistible attraction that<br />  loveliness wields.  Perhaps by the time economism has run its course the society it has built may be tired of itself, bored by its own<br />  hideousness, and may despairingly consent to annihilation, aware that it is too ugly to be let live any longer.<br />Nock's &quot;economism&quot; is something akin to Barber's &quot;McWorld&quot;, a kind of unfettered consumerism.  But where Mr. Barber assumes that<br />this consumerism is somehow imposed from above by all-powerful multinational corporations that manipulate the people, Mr. Nock<br />understood that, on the contrary, the people are likely to eagerly embrace this fate.<br />We see here the fundamental difference between conservatism and liberalism; where liberalism proceeds from the assumption that Man<br />in the state of Nature was some kind of idyllic being, willing to share in the Earth's abundance while devoting himself to ethereal<br />pursuits, conservatism accepts that Man, in the absence of societal restraints and institutions, is a selfish being wholly devoted to the<br />self.  Mr. Barber is correct that the McWorld we saw ourselves rapidly becoming in the 1990s was unlovely, but the fault lay with us,<br />the American citizens, not with some dastardly multinational conglomerates.  No one was forcing us all to obsess over stock prices and<br />stock up on electronics and drink $4 cups of coffee.  The burgeoning economy gave us a period of extravagant wealth and we chose to<br />indulge ourselves.  Not surprisingly, at a time when the livin' was easy, other concerns--the political, the cultural, etc.--were shunted<br />aside while we spoiled ourselves rotten.  I say not surprisingly because as a conservative I would have expected this behavior.  Mr.<br />Barber's problem is that, because he expects people to behave selflessly, he must find a culprit to blame when they act selfishly.

In this extended polemic she lays into all of them with a vengeance, and for good measure throws in the degradation of journalism,<br />brought on by the press's abandonment of standards of objectivity and the cheapening of political discourse under Bill Clinton.  She ties them<br />all together and shows how each represents an attack on reality and a refusal to accept the very idea of objective truth.<br />Drawing on depressingly innumerable examples, she demonstrates the utter ridiculousness of assertions like that of the Afrocentrists, that Greek<br />culture was stolen from black Africa, or of the influential feminist law professor Catharine MacKinnon, that &quot;only 7.8% of women have never<br />been sexually assaulted&quot;, or of racial sensitivity trainers, that only whites can be racist, or of extreme egalitarians, that the very act of grading<br />students involves unfair and necessarily prejudiced judgments about them.  This level of detail should suffice to remove any concern that she's<br />attacking a straw man, and is likewise helpful for anyone whose read Frederick Crews's Postmodern Pooh and found his devastating satirical<br />portrayal of various academic disciplines to be improbable.  Sadly, even the most ludicrous views that conservatives attribute to the tenured<br />radicals turn out not to be misquotes or exaggerations but actual philosophies, shared by many and taught to students.<br />The book is worth reading just for the thoroughness with which Ms Cheney depicts these intellectual pathologies.  Also helpful is the way in<br />which she unifies them as a general assault on truth.  But strangely missing is any effort to discern why this should be.  Her argument that the<br />academic Left is at war with reality and the truth is compelling, but the reader is left wondering what the point of their war is.<br />This omission is curious because you need only look at what all these theories oppose and at what their adherents say and you can see the<br />purpose quite clearly : they seek to discredit Western Civilization.  Given this context, many of these theories begin to make a lot more sense,<br />because for the most part they accurately portray our culture as an exclusive product of straight, white, male, Western European, democratic,<br />capitalist, Judeo-Christians.  The flaw in their collective theories arises not because they are wrong about this basic assertion, but because they<br />think that this fundamental fact, in and of itself, serves to condemn Western Civilization.  It is unsurprising that groups that had little to do with<br />the creation of this culture would seek to denigrate it and it must be particularly galling to them that this culture is responsible for laying the<br />groundwork upon which most of the progress of their cohorts has occurred--after all, women, people of color, gays, etc., have achieved more in<br />the West than in any country or culture that is dominated by their own kind.  To a significant degree, their critique of our culture should be seen<br />as mere envy.<br />However, this analysis also points out the genuine danger of taking such a critique seriously, allowing it to go unchallenged, and allowing them<br />to foist it upon our young; it's all well and good for them to chatter about how wonderful an idealized feminist culture would have been or how<br />much more inclusive a world denuded of religion and morality might be or how much fairer a socialist epoch might have been, but the fact<br />remains that such cultures, if they have ever existed, have been buried by Western Civilization.  The reality that they seek to deny is that<br />Western Civilization is the most successful culture that Man has yet created, and not only has it benefited the dead white European males who<br />dominated it in the past, but also the women, people of color, and others to whom it has now granted a full share of power, freedom, and<br />opportunity.<br />The other problem with their theories, and this Ms Cheney does not get into, is that most proceed from an idealized and naive conception of<br />Man's nature.  They believe in an absolute equality of all mankind which is at odds with human experience.  They assume that variances in<br />ability and achievement must be the result of human oppression and other unnatural factors, rather than a reflection of actual differences.  They<br />would, therefore, impose egalitarianism on society--the equality of results rather than of opportunity--despite the loss of freedom this would<br />entail and despite the dismal track record of societies which have tried this course--see the sorry history of socialism and communism for<br />evidence of the self-destructive legacy of this course of action.  It is here that their denial of reality is the most obvious and the most<br />destructive.<br />Though there is much to admire in this book, it does not suffice for us to merely deny postmodernist criticism of modernity, we must also<br />celebrate the culture that has given us the affluence and liberty that characterize modernity, even the freedoms which allow people to criticize<br />it.  Ms Cheney does an admirable job on defense, but it is long past time for those of us who value modern civilization to go on the offensive.<br />GRADE : Bave been buried by Western Civilization.

An author (or authors) would<br />therefore do well to have something about their book that will distinguish it from the others.  In the<br />exquisite new book, On Great White Wings, Fred Culick and Spencer Dunmore have found just the<br />thing to separate them from the crowd; not only do they explain the technical details of the Wright<br />brothers achievement in the most accessible prose you're likely to find, they also provide a plethora of<br />photos and diagrams that give the reader a brand new appreciation for the brothers' feat and for their<br />other, less well known, accomplishments.<br />The illustrations, over 200 in all, include actual photos of Orville, Wilbur, and the various iterations of<br />their famous Flyer; vintage photos of Kitty Hawk and other locations of importance to the story, and<br />many modern color photos that serve as helpful reminders that these were real places, real men and a<br />real machine.  Meanwhile, the authors rescue the Wright brothers from the mythology that has grown<br />up around them--that they were little more than gifted tinkerers--and shows just how knowledgeable<br />and innovative they truly were.<br />The book also includes a few pictures and some information about a project that Mr. Culick, a<br />professor of aeronautics at Cal Tech, is involved in, which will seek to duplicate the Wright brothers'<br />feat.  Well, almost duplicate it, that is.  It seems that the original Flyer is so unstable that it is widely<br />considered too dangerous to try and fly an exact replica.<br />Any reader looking for just one book about the Wright brothers will find this one to be adequate<br />where the text is concerned and quite probably unsurpassed when it comes to illustrations.  But, if<br />you've the time and the inclination, I'd recommend that you read Bishop's Boys for its more<br />comprehensive treatment of the Wrights and then refer back to On Great White Wings when you're<br />trying to visualize their remarkable flights.<br />GRADE : A-it comes to illustrations.

In my own lifetime alone (a mere forty years)<br />this has included pronouncements that communism was a permanent rival of democracy, perhaps even its superior; that a<br />Silent Spring was coming; that central planning made Japan a more formidable economic power than America with its free<br />market economy; predictions of a new Ice Age in the sixties and, alternatively, of Global Warming in the 90's; dire warnings<br />of a Population Explosion followed by today's obvious underpopulation crisis; and so on and so forth, ad nauseum.  In those<br />four short decades, I've lived through the Sexual Revolution, the Third American Reawakening, the New Age, Women's<br />Liberation, Animal Liberation, Black Pride, Gray Pride, Gay Pride, Handicapped Pride, the Nuclear Age, the Space Age,<br />the Green Revolution, the Information Age, the Digital Revolution, the Imperial Presidency, the incredible shrinking<br />presidency,  yadda, yadda, yadda...  Comes now Juan Enriquez to inform us that we're about to live through the Genomic<br />Age :<br />  THE DOMINANT LANGUAGE ...<br />  AND ECONOMIC DRIVER...OF THIS<br />  CENTURY...IS GOING TO BE<br />  GENETICS.<br />  Those who remain illiterate in this language...<br />  Won't understand the force making the single biggest<br />  difference in their lives.<br />And like all of his predecessors, Mr. Enriquez wants to make sure that we completely restructure our lives and our society<br />around the notion that he's right.<br />The quotation above is in roughly the form that Mr. Enriquez uses in the book, apparently believing that in the future we'll<br />treasure almost random typesetting, variable capitalization, incomplete sentences and the like.  Instead, this style feels<br />incredibly condescending, as if big print, bold lettering, and broad, easily comprehensible ideas are the only way to reach the<br />hoi polloi.<br />In this spirit, Mr. Enriquez does not offer many specifics about how we can prepare for this genomic future, but those he<br />does include seem to indicate that he may have completely missed the point of the 20th Century.  He focusses heavily on the<br />educational end of the equation, apparently believing that having a population that is literate in the language of genomics will<br />suffice to allow nations to participate in the potentially explosive economic growth that genomics may bring.  But the Soviet<br />Union, Cuba, and many other countries expended huge amounts of energy, time, and resources on educating their people in<br />the science of the day and it served for nought.  For one thing, what your people know really doesn't make any difference<br />unless they have the free institutions--capitalism and democracy--in which to utilize their knowledge.<br />For another, states simply lack the flexibility to determine which knowledge will be needed tomorrow and government<br />bureaucracy is too inefficient at the actual educating process.  Perhaps Mr. Enriquez is right about the long term importance<br />of genomics and the revolutionary economic impact it will have, but if he's not, imagine how long it will take a government,<br />once embarked on his project, to realize its mistake and change the emphasis of its curriculum.  Mr. Enriquez himself says<br />that :<br />  Many are unprepared for...<br />  The violence and suddenness with which...<br />  New technologies change...<br />  LIVES ...<br />  COMPANIES ...<br />  COUNTRIES ...<br />  Because they do not understand what these technologies can do.<br />Through all the &quot;revolutions&quot; and &quot;ages&quot; listed above, be they real or imagined, the one thing that remained constant in<br />America, though not as constant as we might like, was the adherence to the idea of freedom.  Theability of democracy and<br />capitalism to adapt to all of these social, scientific, political, and intellectual forces seems to indicate that a climate of freedom<br />is the necessary condition for a society to handle these violent and sudden changes.  Yet he's suggesting locking ourselves<br />into an education system premised on a belief that genomics is necessarily the future : that's pretty sketchy.<br />Finally, who cares if all of us speak the genetic code, so long as enough scientists do?  The digital revolution is humming<br />along quite nicely and not many of us are fluent in binary.  There does not appear to be anything so unique about genetic<br />engineering that it will require widespread knowledge of the genetic code.  Even if genetic manipulation allows me to grow<br />wings, I won't be the one doing the engineering, any more than I know how to fix my own car.<br />There's another element to all of this that is far more sinister, and that's Mr. Enriquez's suggestion that we be prepare<br />ourselves philosophically and ethically to fully exploit the possibilities of genetic technology.  Thus, contemplating the<br />prospect of human cloning, he says that :<br />  The Christian moral and ethical system is ill-equipped to address some of the choices and dilemmas<br />  created by the genomics revolution.<br />  We may all want to pay some attention to the beliefs and consequences...<br />  Explored by religions like Hinduism and Buddhism...<br />  Where reincarnation remains a central tenet...<br />Funny, it would seem more appropriate to me to require that uses of new technologies conform to the traditional moral<br />standards of Western Civilization, not that we ditch those ethical prohibitions that might inconvenience our full exploitation of<br />the science.  If you extend Mr. Enriquez's logic to its inevitable end, doesn't our prospective ability to clone ourselves make<br />every one of us expendable?  Why punish murder if the scientists can just duplicate us?  Maybe that's the point, that this<br />technology holds out the promise of a world where we can finally free ourselves from the moral codes that have restrained<br />us for thousands of years, but is that really a consummation we wish for?<br />It may well be that Mr. Enriquez does not mean quite what these flippant statements of his seem to mean, but the discussion<br />of most issues in the book is so general that it is hard to know for sure.  But we do know this, liberal democratic capitalism<br />has proven uniquely adept at withstanding potentially transformative technologies and social movements.  By allowing people<br />the freedom to study whatever they desire, to band together into cooperative business endeavors, to buy and sell the<br />products and services of their choosing, and by rewarding winners extravagantly and punishing losers harshly, the free<br />market has been able to route these various forces into productive channels.  No matter how great the promise of genomics,<br />it seems awfully unlikely that our current system, or something approximating it, will not be able to deal with it quite<br />effectively.  And because democratic capitalism is so distinctly a phenomenon of the Anglo-American world, the dominant<br />language of the 21st Century is likely to be the same as it was of the 20th, and the 19th, and the 18th : English, specifically<br />that of John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, Edmund Burke, Lord Acton,<br />etc..  And the force that makes the single biggest difference in our lives will continue to be not genomics but freedom.  By all<br />means read the book, there's plenty here that's interesting and it's an easy enough read.  But be wary of taking any of it at<br />face value.  As a general rule, it's helpful to be profoundly skeptical of anyone who advises wholesale changes to the culture,<br />particularly to its moral foundations, just because there's a new idea in town.<br />GRADE : C-uplicate us?

Mario Vargas Llosa pulls<br />no punches in showing the physical torture that Trujillo used to combat his enemies and the mind<br />games and sexual depredations that he used to humiliate and control his &quot;allies&quot;.  But he also makes<br />Trujillo a compelling, though perhaps not sympathetic, figure and he extends the story long enough<br />after Trujillo's assassination to let us see that he had created an environment in which it was possible<br />for him to be succeeded by relatively democratic government.  In the process, he forces us to confront<br />one of the most difficult paradoxes that we face as liberal democrats (a category in which we can<br />include virtually all Americans) : that authoritarian rule, of the kind that Trujillo provided, though we<br />find it repellent in many particulars, may be a vital stepping stone as underdeveloped nations progress<br />towards modernity.<br />The first formulation of this idea that I'm aware of is Jeanne Kirkpatrick's influential 1979 essay in<br />Commentary, &quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards&quot;, in which she differentiated between totalitarian<br />governments, like communist ones, which sought to destroy every institution and vestige of traditional<br />society in order to replace them with their own variants, as opposed to authoritarian ones, like<br />Trujillo's, which, though they were quite repressive and even murderous, maintained traditional<br />institutions--church, aristocracy, military, etc.--and at least paid lip service to the idea of democracy,<br />making it easier for them to eventually evolve into one.  Today, the most effective advocate for the<br />efficacy of such authoritarian regimes is probably Robert D. Kaplan, who makes no bones about his<br />belief that some societies may simply not have developed sufficiently to even handle the freedoms that<br />democracy brings with it.  I've reviewed both their books elsewhere, so I'll not replow old ground<br />here.<br />We should merely note that whether intentionally or not, Mr. Vargas Llosa's novel plays out almost<br />exactly the drama that Ms Kirkpatrick and Mr. Kaplan have described : Trujillo initially provided the<br />stability that was necessary for the Dominican Republic to develop economically and socially, but his<br />very success eventually made his continued rule untenable, as he lost the support of the middle class<br />that he had created, the institutions that he had left in place (specifically the Catholic Church), and the<br />democratic friend that he had cultivated  (the United States).  Despite a spotty record on human rights<br />and democracy and an intervention by the American military, the Dominican Republic in subsequent<br />years has remained relatively stable internally, has remained cooperative with the United States, and<br />has performed better economically than most of its neighbors.  Those of us who adhere to the &quot;realist&quot;<br />school of foreign policy that Kirkpatrick and Kaplan espouse would consider Trujillo's legacy, though<br />mixed, to be more favorable than not.<br />The great service that Mr. Vargas Llosa provides here though is to rub our noses in the corruption, the<br />crimes, the blood and the corpses that supporting a leader like Trujillo necessarily entails.  It may not<br />change the final results of the equation, and it needn't, but it does compel us to tote up the human costs<br />of this terrible moral calculus.  This is a very good thing.  More important, it is a timely thing.  We<br />are entering a period of years where we may well have to make similar calculations in the Islamic<br />world, where we may need to support governments (Turkey's for example) that do not conform to the<br />strict democratic processes and human rights norms that we would like to see in an ideal world, having<br />determined that, in the long run,  such temporarily over repressive governments will likely evolve into<br />the types of liberal democratic systems that we favor.  This tolerance for authoritarian regimes is a<br />sensible and justifiable policy, but we must never lose sight of the deleterious effects that they do have<br />on their citizenry.<br />I've noted in the past the curious fact that there are many great anti-Communist novels, but few good<br />ones that take on right wing dictatorship.  A legion of the greatest novelists of the 20th<br />Century--Orwell, Koestler, Solzhenitsyn, etc.--systematically destroyed the very idea that Communist<br />government was compatible with human liberty, or even simple decency, but there is no similar body<br />of literature that delegitimizes the caudillo-style governance of Franco, Pinochet, and their kind (the<br />only one I know of is Rex Warner's Aerodrome).  Further adding to this mystery, when we finally do<br />get a good novel, this one, that masterfully dissects the evils of such an authoritarian regime it comes<br />from Mario Vargas Llosa, who ran for President of Peru as a conservative and whose political leanings<br />have probably kept him from receiving the Nobel prize.  Curioser and curioser...<br />Mind you. it's a good book, not a great one.  The plot device he uses to tell the story--a middle aged<br />woman returns to the Dominican, recalls her father's troubling career as one of Trujillo's subordinates,<br />and its debilitating consequences for her own life--is totally unnecessary.  She just can't compete for<br />our attention with the much more interesting Trujillo.  Also, the final section of the book that's set in<br />the 60s, with President Joaquin Balaguer leading the transition from Trujillo to something resembling<br />democracy, is a bit too smoothed out, even for someone who believes in it theoretically.  It's helpful to<br />note that Trujillo was assassinated in 1961 and it was just four years later that LBJ had to deploy<br />American troops to put down a revolution.  The road to being a stable, functioning democracy is not<br />without bumps.  One final caution : it is hard not to read the book as at least an oblique criticism of<br />Alberto Fujimori, who defeated Mr. Vargas Llosa in the Peruvian presidential election, won great<br />popularity by imposing order on the terrorism torn nation, but has since had to flee to Japan as<br />evidence of corruption in his government has come to light.  Mr. Vargas Llosa is certainly entitled to<br />an &quot;I told you so&quot; moment, and one wonders what he might have been able to achieve by attempting to<br />govern from the Right, but without repression.  Still, Fujimori's crushing of the Shining Path guerillas<br />was no small feat, one that the author might have had a difficult time accomplishing without some<br />measure of brutality.<br />With those mild caveats though, it is still a fine novel and it couldn't come at a more welcome time.<br />Latin America has hardly reached the End of History, but its future appears secure and very bright, as<br />a trading partner and geopolitical ally of the three NAFTA nations (the U.

His book of Travels,<br />published in the mid 1300s, detailed his 34 year journey (1322-56) through the Near East, Middle East<br />and Far East, successively.  For Europeans who knew little or nothing of these regions, his tales of<br />fantastic animals and of the legendary Prestor John seemed plausible enough and the book was<br />assumed to be true in its entirety.  In fact, Shakespeare and Milton were influenced by his work and<br />Columbus is purported to have used it as the basis for his decision to try sailing to China by heading<br />West.<br />But then the great European explorers began to actually arrive in the places that Mandeville claimed to<br />have visited and, particularly when they reached the Far East, many of his more colorful observations<br />proved to be quite fanciful.  Subsequent investigations by literary critics revealed that great swaths of<br />the book had been lifted from the writings of others, a practice that was not so uncommon in that<br />earlier day, but which necessarily raised further doubts about his veracity.  The backlash against<br />Mandeville ultimately grew to the point where the very notion that he ever traveled came to be<br />doubted and even his existence was questioned by some.<br />According to Giles Milton, the more charitably inclined critics argued that the whole thing was<br />intended as a literary riddle, but one to which we had lost the key.  Mr. Milton himself, who first came<br />upon the book when it literally fell off the shelf of a Paris bookstore, was so captivated by<br />Mandeville's prose that he set out to retrace his travels and try to vindicate his name.  This book<br />recounts the journey, provides much background on Mandeville's, and offers Mr. Milton's solution to<br />the riddle.<br />Retracing Mandeville's footsteps, whether actual or fictional, takes Mr. Milton throughout the Middle<br />East, from Constantinople to Cyprus on through Syria, Jerusalem and the Sinai.  An Englishman<br />abroad in a variety of Muslim states--featuring varying levels of paranoia and suspicion--Mr. Milton's<br />adventures and misadventures make for a very amusing and frequently fascinating read.  It is<br />genuinely amazing how many of the sites that Mandeville &quot;visited&quot; still exist and it is very funny that<br />in nearly every one of them, no matter how remote the setting or how anti-Western the nation, Mr.<br />Milton seems to find a monk from somewhere in England.  More germane to the book, he also finds<br />fairly compelling evidence that Sir John must have, or at least may have, truly seen them in person.<br />Gradually, Mr. Milton builds a case for both the genuine existence of Sir John and for the authenticity<br />of his travels through the Near and Middle East, though even he is dismissive of the possibility of Sir<br />John traveling to the Far East.<br />Thoughout, Mr. Milton is a companionable guide, his enthusiasm for Sir John infectious, and his<br />solution to the Knight's Riddle well defended.  One assumes that this book is being republished<br />because Mr. Milton's subsequent books have done so well, both with critics and with general readers.<br />But, by happenstance, it also covers territory--the Islamic world--that we are all interested in right<br />now.

Army Reserves and sent to Bosnia, I took to sending<br />him crates full of books.  In return he sent me Robert D. Kaplan's Balkan Ghosts.  It was a fairly even<br />exchange.  Mr. Kaplan, most of whose work has appeared in The Atlantic Monthly, has perfected a<br />unique literary form; he combines his vigorous argument for realism in U.S. foreign policy with<br />travelogues, designed to illustrate his points through actual examples from abroad (or at home, as in<br />his Empire Wilderness).  In Ghosts he related stories of his travels throughout the Balkans, exploring<br />how and why the age old ethnic hatreds that had so regularly convulsed the region still endured, and<br />were likely to, no matter what policy the West adopted.  The book became notorious when Bill<br />Clinton cited it as the reason he was hesitant to commit U. S. military forces to the region.  But<br />nothing gives an author credibility like having a President acknowledge that you'd influenced his<br />thinking, and Kaplan has become an unlikely best-selling author and a foreign policy voice to be<br />reckoned with.<br />The Coming Anarchy is less of a travel book than Mr. Kaplan's others, though he does draw upon his<br />many journeys.  Instead, it gathers a number of his essays from The Atlantic (including the title piece),<br />The Wall Street Journal, and The National Interest.  Included herein are  appreciations of books like<br />Conrad's Nostromo, Gibbon's Decline and Fall and Henry Kissinger's A World Restored and policy<br />prescriptions, for what kind of aid we should offer the Third World and how we should use our<br />Intelligence services, but the bulk of the book (over half) is taken up by The Coming Anarchy and<br />Was Democracy Just a Moment, which taken together argue that, contrary to the expectations of most<br />in the West, including analysts of both Right and Left, the future of most of the world is unlikely to be<br />one of peace, justice, and economic growth, brought on by liberal democratic reforms, but will instead<br />be characterized by a decline into anarchy, tribalism, and warfare.<br />His most important insight, one that has thus far been inadequately dealt with by either him or his<br />critics, is that stable democracy and free market capitalism appear to require certain preconditions<br />before they can take root.  These include a middle class, functioning social institutions, law and order,<br />and the like.  Yet much of Western foreign policy for at least the past hundred years has been based on<br />the fanciful notion that every nation, regardless of its unique history, culture, and current<br />circumstances, would automatically be a better place if only it enjoyed the same amount of freedom as<br />we do.  On the contrary, Mr. Kaplan argues that :<br />  Not democracies but authoritarian systems, including monarchies, create middle classes--which,<br />  having achieved a certain size and self-confidence, revolt against the very dictators who generated<br />  the prosperity.<br />The import of this idea, if it is correct, which I have long believed it to be, is that while we continue<br />to celebrate freedom and democracy here in the West, we may have to accept that developing nations<br />are better off having an intermediate authoritarian stage before they attempt to emulate us.<br />[...]<br />Though Herbert Butterfield famously said that realism is more of a boast than a philosophy, properly<br />understood realism is an important corrective to the utopian dreams of do-gooder liberals and<br />libertarian conservatives.  We can not improve the lives of the citizens of other countries either<br />through purely governmental solutions to their problems, like redistributing wealth, or by blithely<br />prescribing freedom for them.  Realism, that is the willingness to learn something from the real world,<br />requires us to acknowledge that these conventional kinds of Western notions will have to wait until<br />such countries have reached a much higher state of development.  We merely indulge our own fancies<br />when we suggest that they try them out now.  To do so is simply, as Mr. Kaplan masterfully shows,<br />quite probably counterproductive and, to put it baldly, unrealistic.<br />GRADE : A-ll have to wait until <BR>such countries have reached a much higher state of development.

And I'd just say, ladies and gentlemen, one of the qualities of American politics that distinguishes us<br />  from other nations is that we judge our politicians as much by the manner in which they leave<br />  office as by the vigor with which they pursue it. You do not lay claim to the office you hold, it lays<br />  claim to you. Your obligation is to bring to it the gifts you can of labor and honesty and then to<br />  depart with grace. And my time to leave this office has come, and I will seek the presidency with<br />  nothing to fall back on but the judgment of the people, and nowhere to go but the White House or<br />  home.<br />  Six times - six times I've run for Republican leader of the United States Senate and six times my<br />  colleagues, giving me their trust, have elected me, and I'm proud of that.<br />  So my campaign for the president is not merely about obtaining office. It's about fundamental<br />  things, consequential things, things that are real. My campaign is about telling the truth, it's about<br />  doing what is right, it's about electing a president who's not attracted to the glories of the office, but<br />  rather to its difficulties. It's about electing a president, who once he takes office, will keep his<br />  perspective and remain by his deepest nature and inclination one of the people.<br />  Therefore, as the campaign for the president begins in earnest, it is my obligation to the Senate and<br />  to the people of America to leave behind all the trappings of power, all comfort and all security.<br />  So today (Wednesday, May 15, 1996) I announce that I will forego the privileges not only of the<br />  office of the majority leader but of the United States Senate itself, from which I resign effective on<br />  or before June 11th. And I will then stand before you without office or authority, a private citizen,<br />  a Kansan, an American, just a man.  But I will be the same man I was when I walked into the room,<br />  the same man I was yesterday and the day before, and a long time ago when I arose from my<br />  hospital bed and was permitted by the grace of God to walk again in the world. And I trust in the<br />  hard way, for little has come to me except in the hard way, which is good because we have a hard<br />  task ahead of us.<br />  -Bob Dole's resignation speech from the U. S. Senate (written, at least in part, by Mark<br />Helprin)<br />Since at least the publication of Winter's Tale, Mark Helprin has been hailed as a writer's writer.  This<br />generally means someone who gets stellar reviews from the critics for the quality of his prose and his<br />use of language, but who pays little attention to either formal plot or the desire of the average reader<br />to comprehend what the author's up to.  I've read, or tried reading, all of his novels, many of his short<br />stories, and even his children's books, and I readily admit that while he does write beautifully at times,<br />I find it daunting to try to wend my through the 500 or so pages he typically serves up.  I'm not<br />someone who is willing to forgo narrative structure just because the words are pretty.<br />However, especially in recent years, Helprin has emerged as one of the most graceful and consistently<br />insightful conservative columnists in America, writing mainly in the pages of the Wall Street Journal.<br />In addition, in both the speech above and in the portion of the 1996 GOP Convention speech that he<br />wrote, Helprin performed the nearly miraculous feat of making Bob Dole sound eloquent.  So I keep<br />reading his books, just waiting for the one that will combine his political ideas, his imagination, and<br />his beautiful language into a truly great book.  In my opinion he still has yet to achieve this greatness,<br />but in Memoir from Antproof Case he seems to be getting closer.<br />For one thing, the book has a fascinating and frequently hilarious protagonist, an old man hiding out<br />from assassins in Brazil--a life as an orphan, fighter pilot, billionaire, murderer, and much more<br />behind him--consigning his colorful life story to the antproof case that will protect them so that his<br />wife's son by another man can eventually read them.  The memoirs would be amusing enough on their<br />own, but even more enthralling are his obsessions and phobias, chief among them his hatred of coffee.<br />the &quot;evil bean that enslaves half the world.&quot;<br />Though still an over bounteous smorgasbord of a book, it benefits from a much more defined sense of<br />narrative direction than some of Helprin's others and that goes a long way towards carrying the reader<br />through the lulls and misdirections.

For 1997, at least, their spin had carried the day.<br />  -Howard Kurtz, Spin Cycle<br />In a story that is utterly devoid of edifying moments and chock full of quite depressing ones, these<br />final lines of the book are the most shocking.  For it is only as you read them that the full realization<br />hits home that Howard Kurtz's justifiably jaded and cynical look at the way the Clinton administration<br />manipulated the press and the public in order to cover up or blunt scandal was written before the<br />Lewinsky scandal broke.  Commingled with the shock though is the sudden comprehension that the<br />Clinton Administration was uniquely well prepared to deal with such a scandal, having spent the prior<br />seven years honing their obfuscatory skills on a whole series of equally disturbing and potentially<br />damaging scandals.<br />In fact, as Kurtz notes in a hastily tacked on Epilogue, one that subsequent events were to wholly<br />outpace, in the deposition that Bill Clinton gave in the Jones case, on the weekend that Matt Drudge<br />broke the Monica story, he revealed that he had in fact had sex with Gennifer Flowers.  In other<br />words, on the very first occasion that most Americans saw Clinton, the infamous Super Bowl night 60<br />Minutes appearance, he lied to us all, with Hillary at his side, and it worked.<br />What Howard Kurtz really ends up detailing for us is just the long dress rehearsal before the big show,<br />in which the Clintons and their spin machine worked out all the kinks in their act.  By the time the<br />Lewinsky scandal broke, they understood that all they had to do was deny initially, demonize liberally<br />(both accusers and investigators), leak pre-emptively, and acknowledge belatedly and they would be<br />able to so desensitize the press and the people that Bill Clinton would ultimately survive.  And so, as<br />the tawdry mess reached its foreordained conclusion, we had the hitherto unimaginable situation of a<br />credible rape charge (by Juanita Broaddrick) against the President of the United States, which he did<br />not even deny, but which the press chose not to hound him with.  He had finally just beaten them<br />down to the point where they didn't have the heart to pursue another scandal.<br />Then, in a moment which nearly redeems him, Clinton left office in a blizzard of bartered pardons and<br />other final acts of contempt for the staffers, supporters, and voters who had excused everything he'd<br />ever done.  It was the final (...) gesture of a man who clearly understood that he had so implicated a<br />nation in his treachery that he had become untouchable.  To judge Bill Clinton at that late date would<br />have required people to face all of the excuses and allowances that they'd made for him in the<br />preceding eight years, and that was not going to happen.  It was all just so brazen that it was hard not<br />to admire the in-your-face flourish with which he departed.  Howard Kurtz does a fine job of charting<br />the early years of the Clinton scandals, but there was so much more yet to come.<br />GRADE : B+unimaginable situation of a <BR>credible rape charge (by Juanita Broaddrick) against the President of the United States, which he did <BR>not even deny, but which the press chose not to hound him with.

First, he succeeds in the primary task of<br />the popular historian, making history compelling, and readable and important to our modern lives.<br />Second, he makes the things we know, and take for granted, seem fresh and marvelous.  Finally, he<br />shows us that even more wonderful ideas and themes lurk just beneath the surface of the history that<br />we all think we know.  The result is a book that confirms our understanding of the importance of the<br />Jews and makes us appreciate them in ways that many of us may not have before.<br />We well understand the central importance of Judaism to be its monotheism.  A world with many gods<br />offers no guidance for human behavior; different gods may demand different behaviors.  But a single<br />God can command one set of behaviors from us, and is therefore the source of morality, of the<br />morality which can bind an entire society or civilization, eventually the species, to one coherent set of<br />ethical principles.  The one God, a unity Himself, provides Man with the understanding that the<br />Universe is a unity and is governed by a single, unified set of laws and principles.  This is a<br />magnificent thing, and by itself would be a sufficient gift to make the Jews a great people.<br />But Cahill only even gets to this part of the story after explicating a prior gift, one that is just as<br />important to Man's development : the idea of progress.  Prior to the rise of Judaism, men believed in<br />life as a circularity.  We're born.  We die.  The next generation comes along and repeats the process.<br />Life has no direction, merely keeps reiterating itself.  Cahill explains that it is only with Abraham and<br />the command of God that he &quot;Go forth from your land, from your birthplace and from your father's<br />home to the land that I will show you.&quot; that the idea of life as a journey of discovery is born.  Cahill<br />understands Abraham to be, and makes us understand him to be, our first great explorer, the first<br />human to intentionally set out for the unknown.  Further, he demonstrates how this notion of life as a<br />process or a progression created the very idea of history, of a past that was different than the present,<br />and the understanding that the future will be different than the present, that the way things are now<br />will eventually be history.  By the time he's done, Cahill may well convince you that &quot;Abraham went&quot;<br />is the most thrilling passage in all of literature.<br />There is much more in the book, as Cahill attempts, largely successfully, to demonstrate that nearly<br />every single facet of our lives has been shaped by Judaism.  He throws off ideas like a blacksmith<br />throws off sparks, and if some sputter out, many more of them catch fire.  He definitely has some<br />political biases, sometimes welcome, as his determination to show that anti-Semitism is wrongheaded,<br />sometimes less so, as his argument in favor of a kind of gushy social justice.  But the fact that he is so<br />opinionated generally serves him well, and if he sometimes slips into hyperbole, he is never less than<br />thought provoking.  He has a great deal of fun with his topic and you will too.makes us understand him to be, our first great explorer, the first <BR>human to intentionally set out for the unknown.

This welcome assignment affords him the<br />opportunity to try and track down his pre-War lover Lena Brandt, wife of a brilliant mathematician<br />who ended up working in the Nazi rocket program.  As he searches through the rubble of the<br />devastated city and navigates the corruption and black markets, Jake also becomes involved in a<br />murder mystery, surrounding the shooting of a venal American G.I.  It quickly becomes evident that<br />the two investigations are  intertwined as Jake uncovers a covert battle between American and Soviet<br />intelligence operatives aimed at collecting as many Nazi scientists as they can get their respective hands<br />on, both sides needing to pick their brains to gain an advantage in the Third World War that obviously<br />looms on the horizon.<br />Mr. Kanon, as in his earlier thriller Los Alamos, makes effective use of the historic setting, letting the<br />actual situation provide a constant background tension.  He also creates a series of characters whose<br />motivations and ethical dilemmas are sufficiently complex as to make it seem like he takes the moral<br />dimension of his tale seriously.  But again, as in his earlier book, the author fails miserably in fleshing<br />out the full moral context of the story.<br />Obviously one has to feel some qualms about the crimes that were excused or overlooked in our haste<br />to rebuild Germany and to get ahold of Nazi technology and expertise that had made Germany such a<br />formidable military power, but Mr. Kanon ignores the fact that we had just spent four years ignoring<br />equally repellent Soviet crimes while they helped us defeat the Nazis.  By 1945 it was way too late to<br />reclaim our spiritual virginity, we'd already bedded down with one evil, all we did after the war was<br />hop into a different bed, and at least in the latter case we'd defeated the Germans before we<br />collaborated with them.  Though FDR seems to have deluded himself about the true nature of the<br />Soviets, Winston Churchill was realistic enough to acknowledge that they were evil.  Criticized by his<br />political cohorts for being overenthusiastic about the Russian alliance, Churchill said :<br />  If Hitler invaded Hell, I would make at least a favourable reference to the Devil in the House of<br />  Commons.<br />The comparison is entirely apt.<br />Personally, I think it was a mistake to ally ourselves with the USSR in the first place, I'd have left<br />them and the Nazis to grind themselves into a bloody pulp on the Eastern Front.  In the event, even<br />after helping the Soviets conquer all of Eastern Europe and even with them threatening a war-weary<br />Western European, I think you could have made a good case for bringing American troops home after<br />Germany was defeated.  Trying to dominate all of Europe would have so overextended the USSR that<br />it would have fallen apart even more quickly than it did as a result of the fifty year policy of<br />containment that we pursued instead.  But we didn't follow either of these options; we confronted<br />Hitler with the Soviet Union at our side and then confronted the Soviets with a democratic West<br />Germany and a number of former Nazis at our side.  It is utterly disingenuous to mount one's high<br />horse over the one moral compromise, I believe the lesser, without at least acknowledging the other.<br />Beyond this intellectual dishonesty, there are a few other problems with the book.  For one thing it is<br />simply too long and owes its length to quite standard chase scenes and gunplay.  It doesn't help matters<br />either that Mr. Kanon has Jake running all over Berlin facing off with Russian generals, American<br />cloak and dagger types, and black marketers.  George Clooney has signed to play him in the movie,<br />but it reads like a role for Schwarzenegger.  The other problem with Jake is that his own moral<br />difficulties make it all too easy for those he confronts to turn the tables on him.  For one thing he's an<br />adulterer.  For another, he's manipulating people, cutting corners, and causing deaths to serve his own<br />purposes.  And he's accompanying  a conquering army; imagine how he might have acted if he'd been<br />trying to survive the death throes of the Third Reich.  This makes his self-righteous indignation<br />awfully difficult to stomach.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Kanon is a bestselling author so no editor is going to push him to improve.  He's<br />now settled into a formula that works well enough, but leaves the reader somewhat frustrated.  A<br />better, more focussed, novel lurks within the too numerous pages of this just adequate thriller.<br />GRADE : Chwarzenegger.

For his first novel, Canin takes most of the themes and many of the quirky details from his story collection, Emperor of the Air (see review above), and hammers them into a tale of two brothers which displays all of the same strengths and weaknesses that the stories did.  Once again, we see that Canin has the makings of a terrific writer.  But, once again we are given characters with deformities or odd medical ailments (Canin is a Doctor), asked to believe that people are continually having sudden life changing epiphanies and exposed to Canin's really disturbing vision of humans in general and families in specific--his malevolent portraits of all religious believers are particularly disgusting, but in addition fathers are always leaving Canin's families and he trots out his canard about how sons are inescapably moral clones of their fathers &amp; here expands it to brothers being identical.  Having repeated these themes so often, there must be some element of autobiography here &amp; it makes you wonder about his mental health.<br />One structural weakness is new.  The bulk of the book consists of one brother addressing another and recounting the events of their boyhood, as Christopher Lehmann-Haupt put it in his Times review:<br />  This literary device, formally known as apostrophe, bears no resemblance to any realistic way<br />  of addressing someone. One might use it accusatorily:  &quot;You so-and-so. You did such-and-such<br />  to me. It was your unconscious way of putting me down.&quot; But to write as if the addressee doesn't<br />  know how he used to put on his shirt or doesn't remember the women he slept with is so unnatural<br />  as to undermine the novel's best effects. In an age when books have to compete with such a<br />  powerful storytelling media as film and videotape, writers can't afford to dally with such flimsy<br />  narrative contrivances.<br />You'd really have to read the book to appreciate how annoying and artificial this narrative device becomes.<br />But the books greatest weakness, one it shares with any number of recent novels (Snow Falling on Cedars and While I Was Gone spring to mind), is the flaccidity of the moral dilemma that lies at its core.  The narrator of the novel is tormented by feelings of guilt.  The soliloquies apologizing for enjoying a comfortable life as a doctor trigger an overwhelming desire to see him horsewhipped.  But as the story progresses we discover that the guilt is rooted in a &quot;betrayal&quot; of his brother.  This is a betrayal in Canin's mind, but it is, in fact, roughly equivalent to the action of the Unabomber's brother.  The brother, you see, is a sociopath.  Oh sure, the narrator's motives are suspect, but c'mon, he exposed a serial arsonist for chrissakes.<br />I was prepared to forgive many of these problems in his short story collection, but to repeat them here seems unforgivable.  Hopefully, with this novel out of his system, Mr. Canin will move on to some new themes and will abandon the family, which he seems singularly unsuited to write about.<br />GRADE: Dbook to appreciate how annoying and artificial this narrative device becomes. <br />But the books greatest weakness, one it shares with any number of recent novels (Snow Falling on Cedars and While I Was Gone spring to mind), is the flaccidity of the moral dilemma that lies at its core.

Parker.  Paradoxically, having immersed himself in the writings of the genre while he was an academic, Parker proceeded to violate the conventions which made it great when he became an author.  Now, I'm not saying that a writer has to slavishly follow the conventions of the genre, but if he's going to violate them, it should be for reasons that add something to his text.  I believe that Parker, and his successors, have instead produced inferior work.<br />The most important convention of the genre that Parker has tampered with is, &quot;the hero as loner&quot;.  Bad enough that Spenser has his ongoing relationship with the profoundly annoying Susan Silverman (supposedly their relationship is modeled on Parker's with his own wife; God help him), he also has a virtual child in Paul and his relationships with Hawk, Belsen, Quirk, etc. are so close, that people who hire Spenser, essentially get a whole team.<br />One result is that Spenser ends up maintaining an emotional distance from his cases, at a couple points he has even told clients that he would protect Susan before them.  Compare this with the quintessential private eye series, Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer novels.  Archer was continually getting over involved with clients, their wives &amp; children, as each case became the emotional focus of his otherwise empty life.  This emotional vulnerability is a key element of the best novels of the genre.<br />Likewise, Parker has eliminated the physical and legal risks that the hero faces.  Spenser's friends are all so powerful that there's never a sense that Spenser is vulnerable.  Of course, we know that he won't ever lose a fist fight or be beaten up. But we, and his opponents, also know that even if he gets in trouble, his cronies will bail him out--Hawk will shoot them, Quirk will arrest them or, at least,  not arrest Spenser &amp; even the Mob will come after them.<br />The result of this genre busting is that the Spenser tales are largely devoid of dramatic tension.  His emotional distance from cases and physical invulnerability have combined to make for stories that are rather flat and formulaic; an ironic result considering the attempt to escape the classic p.i. formula.<br />A Savage Place demonstrates all of these points by removing Spenser from his familiar background and transplanting him to Southern California.  Candy Sloan is an ambitious TV reporter who has stumbled onto a story about union corruption in the movie industry.  When her life is threatened, the TV station hires Spenser to guard her.<br />With Susan back home in Boston, Spenser is free to focus on the case and become involved with Candy.  And, removed from the protection of Hawk and Quirk, he finds himself vulnerable to hoodlums and lawmen alike.  These factors combine to provide us with the most satisfactory entry in the long running Spenser series and provide a bittersweet peak at what this series could have been.<br /><br />GRADE: Am. <br />The result of this genre busting is that the Spenser tales are largely devoid of dramatic tension.

A man-of-war is the very thing for a<br />  philosopher, above all in the Mediterranean: there are the birds, the fishes--I could promise you<br />  some monstrous strange fishes--the natural phenomena, the meteors, the chance of prize-money.<br />  For even Aristotle would have been moved by prize-money.... '<br />  'A ship must be a most instructive theatre for an inquiring mind....'<br />  'Prodigiously instructive, I do assure you, Doctor.'<br />  -Jack Aubrey convincing Stephen Maturin to ship out with him (Patrick O'Brian, Master and Commander)<br />Like most, I first learned of Patrick O'Brian's excellent series of naval adventures in the pages of the New York Times Book Review.  There, on January 6, 1991, Richard Snow wrote that the Aubrey and Maturin books were : &quot;...the best historical novels ever written.&quot;  This statement is not as jarring now as it was then.  We've grown accustomed to seeing rows of O'Brian's books on store shelves and millions have joined what was once an exclusive cult, but at the time Snow was writing the novels were still a well-kept secret, despite the fact that O'Brian had then been writing them for over twenty years.  At any rate, like any good little trend-sucking dilettante, I rushed out to find the first book in the series, Master and Commander, read it as quickly as possible, and was well and truly stumped.<br />I liked the characters, found the detailed portrayal of life aboard ship to be extremely interesting, and enjoyed much of the humor of the book.  But there was something really curious and elusive about the storytelling.  In the first place, the heroes are mere observers of the climactic sea battle, having been captured earlier, which seemed especially curious for an adventure story.  Even more disconcerting was the sense that I lacked much of the background information that the author expected the reader to bring to the novel.  It seemed as if O'Brian expected you to already be familiar with much of the early 19th century naval terminology, with the intricacies of the Napoleonic Wars, and with the culture, customs and language of the day.  It was like listening to a comedian and only understanding one out of every two or three jokes--you titter nervously and you can follow along thanks to context, but it's a tad humiliating.  I did like it enough to read the next though, Post Captain, and as I did, the joke finally dawned on me.<br />Patrick O'Brian writes these novels so that they could be read, understood, and enjoyed by the characters who populate them.  The reason that they so effectively transport us to another time and place is because they seem to have been written there and then.  His mission here is not to explain that epoch to us, but to present it for our consideration, nearly unadorned by modern sensibilities.  He writes as if he were actually a contemporary of his heroes and the books have the quality, not of historical novels at all, but instead of classic tales newly rediscovered.  Thanks to this unusual style, O'Brian is more often compared to Jane Austen than to C. S. Forester.<br />I don't mean to mislead anyone; the books aren't for all tastes and, even if you love them, O'Brian's  manner can be frustrating--you sometimes wish you had an interpreter.  But once you figure out what he's doing, if you accept the technique, you're in for a real treat.  The writing is outstanding.  The setting is endlessly interesting.  Aubrey, the bluff and hearty sea captain, and Maturin, the vulpine doctor and spy, make for a classic pairing of steadfast opposites, in the tradition of Holmes and Watson.  It is not easy reading but it is rewarding and once you read a couple, you'll be hooked.  And be warned, before he died earlier this year, O'Brian had completed twenty novels in the series, so you'll be hooked for a good long time.<br />GRADE : A+d as if O'Brian expected you to already be familiar with much of the early 19th century naval terminology, with the intricacies of the Napoleonic Wars, and with the culture, customs and language of the day.

A young brother and sister--Boone (14) and Alice (12), the narrator--are convinced that their new step-father, Simon Jester, means them no good.  Like the character of Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) in Night of the Hunter, Simon is a bible-thumper, whom only the children can sense the evil in.  Like the Shelley Winters character, their mother, Meg, is so air-headed that she is unable to protect them. There's even ten thousand dollars kicking around, though here it is the the step-father, not the kids, who has it and who guards it jealously.<br />The first portion of the book is a tense battle of wits between Simon and the children as they try to learn his secrets, particularly what really happened to the wife and son he says were tragically drowned.  But then one evening, after Meg has become pregnant and made the children all the more superfluous to Simon, their mother whispers one word to Alice : Run.<br />Meanwhile, another story has been ticking along in the background, of a young girl named Persely Snow, who poisoned her mother and father, killing the mother.  At first we are only aware of her because Boone is somewhat obsessed, writing letters to her in the state hospital for the insane, urging her to give her life over to Jesus.  Persley's responses are profanely funny and belittle Boone horribly, but when she escapes, which she does frequently, the police assume that Boone must be helping her.  Eventually she does show up and when she shares her story it turns out that she considers herself a soulmate of Jed Cooper, the vengeance seeking Clint Eastwood character in Hang 'em High, even down to the noose burn around her neck.  She has her own bit of advice for the kids :<br />  'Poison him Boone,' she added suddenly.  'And poison her too, for being so weak.  For caring more<br />  about him than her own kids.'<br />  My brother shifted his position.  The crackle of old leaves and the mulchy whisper of pine straw.<br />  'Don't talk like that.  Please.  It's not right.'<br />  'He deserves it don't he?  And don't she?'<br />  'It's not up to us to judge.'<br />  'And who's supposed to judge?'<br />  'God.'<br />  'There ain't no friggin' God.  There's nothing in the world but the way things are already gonna turn<br />  out.  You gotta be God yourself, and sometimes even that don't help.'<br />Persley is recaptured this time, but in the end escapes again and runs away with Boone and Alice, the three of them hiding on Never Island, on seemingly bottomless Lake Shine.<br />The story builds to an inevitable confrontation with Simon, but with plenty of unexpected twists and turns along the way, and ends much differently than you might expect.  Alice is a marvelous narrator, wise and witty beyond her years.  The homage to a couple of great literary antecedents is wonderful and will hopefully spur readers to seek out the original sources.  In general, it's a surprisingly successful sophmore effort.<br />I do have some quarrels with the book though.  (***) In fact, it is about the tension between the emotional desire for vengeance versus the rational pursuit for justice.  It is appropriate to a world bereft of God and in which men are merely evil (as is the case in the novel) for revenge to triumph, but it is hard to believe that such a world will benefit women and children much.<br />But hey, it's an author's prerogative to portray the world as they imagine it.  And there's so much here to like that I don't want to scare anyone off.  In particular, the \\"absence of nectar\\" of the title refers to the disruption which occurs in the family's bee hives as the story unfolds.  Like Night of the Hunter, it is the breakdown of a nuclear family that sets in motion a chain of unnatural events.<br />  (***)Sure, it's grudging, but it's still an admission that guys might not be quite so bad in the final analysis.<br />Kathy Hepinstall does write women's books, in the sense that her political worldview is distinctly female and at least somewhat antimale.

The most notorious example of this was their opposition to the Vietnam War, during which they turned a perfectly typical lack of enthusiasm for warfare on the part of those who will actually have to do the fighting, into a sweeping judgment that the war was itself immoral.<br />This annoying trait has never been put on more ostentatious display than here in James Carroll's memoir about his tortured relationship with his father during the war years.  Joe Carroll, who had quit the seminary just before his ordination as a priest, went on to become a lawyer, an FBI agent, an Air Force General, and the first director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  Having judged himself unworthy to be a priest, he and his devout wife Mary placed their hopes in their sons, with James, after his older brother Joe contracted polio, becoming the natural choice to become a priest.  James did go through the motions of joining the priesthood, though it's never clear from his narrative that he held any genuine religious beliefs, but as he became increasingly involved in the Catholic Left anti-War movement of the 60's &amp; 70's, he eventually quit the Church.  He has since become a bestselling novelist, a Boston Globe columnist, written this prize-winning memoir and has just written Constantine's Sword, a &quot;historical&quot; account of anti-Semitism in the Catholic Church (see Orrin's review).<br />These are the bare bones of the story and they suggest a young man whose opposition to the immorality of the Vietnam War causes a crisis of faith.  In point of fact, the War seems to have had little to do with Carroll's personal crisis, certainly its morality had nothing to do with it, instead the story he has to tell is that age old tale of youth rebelling against authority.  I'm loathe to engage in psychoanalysis, being both unqualified and not much of a believer in its efficacy, but Carroll uses the term Oedipal so often and the book is cast so clearly in the form of an Oedipal drama that it's hard to avoid doing so.  Start with the fact that he outdoes his father by actually becoming a priest, where Joe fell short; continue with the way that this profession figuratively wed him to his pious mother, whose entry to Heaven would be virtually guaranteed by virtue of having borne a priest; move along to his utter rejection of his father's profession and an eventual adoption of complete pacifism; then conclude with his decision to leave the priesthood after his father had been forced out of government and crippled by disease.  It's hard to see how Vietnam actually matters to any of this psychodrama : had his Dad been a butcher, Carroll would have become a vegetarian, had he been a fireman, Carroll would have been an arsonist.  This is a mere story of generational tension dressed up in the ennobling guise of a great moral struggle.<br />The most revealing aspect of Carroll's self-portrait and the account of the moral dilemma he supposedly faced as a result of the War is his complete failure to consider the consequences of peace on the Vietnamese people.  His opposition to the War, as he himself depicts it, is almost exclusively a function of the fact that he's made uncomfortable by the means that were being used to conduct it.  There is not a single word of consideration here of what would, and did, happen to the people of Vietnam once America withdrew.  The moral calculus at work seems to be that it is better that Vietnam be destroyed by Communism than that a single American have to commit an act which will trouble his conscience.  That is a perfectly honorable argument to make, and a necessary corollary of pacifism.<br />Even this shortcoming would not be so bad were it not for the impact it has on the rest of the book.  But one result of his failure to treat this issue is that he ignores what was certainly a central motivation of Cold Warriors like his father.  They certainly prosecuted the War because they had considered the consequences of not doing so and found these consequences unacceptable.  While it is possible, perhaps even accurate, to argue that they were wrong in their determination, simple fairness requires that Carroll give them their due and look at their legitimate motivations.  Deprived, by the author, of the beliefs that drove them, they are presented as one-dimensional characters whose sole purpose is to stand as convenient villains in Carroll's little morality play.<br /> At one point in the book Carroll places the &quot;blame&quot; for American involvement in Vietnam on the Catholic Church and the advocacy for intervention of folks like Cardinal Spellman.  Though delusional, this assertion is of a piece with his blaming the Holocaust on the Catholic Church, as he does in the aforementioned Constantine's Sword.  One has, first of all, to be troubled by a man who attributes such power to an institution which after all represents a minority of the citizens of Germany and the United States and which has proven incapable of influencing those nations on such issues as birth control, and the like.  Secondly, one can't help noticing that there's an element here of reenacting the Oedipal drama with his biological father, his rebellion now directed towards the figurative father, the Church, perhaps even God.  The cumulative effect of these two books is to suggest that the greater problem lies not in the sins, real or imagined, of Joe Carroll and the Catholic Church but in the psychological conflicts of James Carroll.<br />Finally, Carroll claims to have arrived at the viewpoint that war is always unjust.  How then would he square his concern over the Holocaust with this position ?  He makes much over his obsession with the threat of nuclear war : but if we'd had the bomb in the late 30's or early 40's, or better yet, if Churchill had it, would Carroll really oppose dropping it on Hitler and the high command of the Nazi Party, no matter how many innocent civilian lives it would have claimed ?  Would he really be unwilling to sacrifice 30,000 or 40,000 or however many in order to save the tens of millions who ended up dying during the War ?  For an author who writes with such smug self-certainty about the purity of his own moral vision, and who is so eager to judge the moral failings of others, he somehow manages to avoid the really hard questions that his newfound philosophy raises. For all that these books are about the author himself, they ultimately reflect fairly little deliberation over the ramifications of the moral choices that he's made.<br />Which brings us to the final legacy of the Baby-Boom generation.  They have succeeded brilliantly in rebellion, in rejecting the institutions, the morals, and the beliefs of their parents and the other generations that came before them.  The problem they have left behind is what should replace the Judeo-Christian culture which they've done their best to destroy. Perhaps in this sense James Carroll's book is a signal text for his generation : just as he speaks eloquently about rejecting the faith of his fathers but falls silent about what has replaced it, his generation stands amidst the rubble they have created and have no idea what to erect in its place.<br />GRADE : D-ores what was certainly a central motivation of Cold Warriors like his father.

In 1975, a freelance writer named Chuck Ross was convinced that unknown writers<br />  just didn't have a chance to have a novel accepted. To test his theory, Ross typed out the first<br />  twenty-one pages of Steps and sent them out to four publishers, using the pseudonym &quot;Erik<br />  Demos.&quot; All four rejected the sample. In 1977, Ross typed out the entire book and, again using the<br />  name &quot;Erik Demos,&quot; sent it to ten publishers and thirteen literary agents. One of the publishers was<br />  Random House, which had originally published Steps in 1969. The manuscript was neither<br />  recognized nor accepted by any publishers or literary agents, including Random House, which used<br />  a form rejection letter. That made twenty-seven rejections for a book that had won an important<br />  literary prize!<br />  -Gloria T. Delamar, Getting Rejected? Feeling Dejected? (Philadelphia Writers&iacute; Conference, Inc.)<br />Upon reading the novel, the 70's editors appear to have made the better decision : not to publish.  The book is little more than a catalogue of one man's often violent sexual fantasies.  I know, I know, it's supposed to be some kind of fable about how the brutality of modern life is manifested in this one victim's sex life.  However, loathe as I am to defend modernity, I don't think you can blame totalitarian government, criminal violence and the other social pathologies of the 20th Century for your need to objectify your menagerie of lovers.  Here is a chilling statement from the book, one that nicely sums up much of the sexual revolution :<br />  [B]eyond you and me together, I see myself in our love-making.  It is this vision of myself as your<br />  lover I wish to retain and make more real.<br />Okay, so you can argue that this is the essential point Kosinski's trying to make, and I do nearly find it compelling.  But, as I mentioned in my review of Painted Bird, he is just too fascinated by scenes of rape and other forms of degradation (here he adds bestiality) for the reader to accept that they are integral to the plot.  Instead, the reader gets the unsettling feeling that the author is offering a too revealing glimpse of his own warped obsessions.<br />I don't know about anyone else, but I can think of nothing less interesting than reading about another person's disturbed, and therefore disturbing, sexual predilections.  I have enough difficulty handling my own, admittedly odd, passion for Margaret Thatcher, that Iron Lady of my fevered dreams...<br />GRADE : Dt compelling.

It tells the tale of the unhappy upbringing of Ernest Pontifex; unhappy because his parents aren't nice to him & his father insists on a strict theology.  The critics, Shaw, Pritchett, etc., hail it as the novel which destroyed the Victorian facade of the happy family.  I guess noone had read Dickens or Trollope.<br />I honestly don't get it.  I know that the elites loathed Victorian England, but it's intellectually dishonest to pretend that contemporary authors, like Dickens and Trollope, didn't question the pretensions and conventions of their day. They act as if there was a huge conspiracy of silence and everyone believed life was perfect, until books like this one exploded onto the scene.  This is patently untrue.<br />Butler seems more important as a key figure on the road to the interior or psychological novel.  It's easy to see the debt that authors like Joyce owe to him.  Pretty much nothing happens and the whole book turns on Ernest having (...) parents.<br />Tom Wolfe is giving hundreds of interviews right now decrying the psychological novel and begging authors to go out into the world and observe the life and energy of the country.

I'd just like to mention a couple of the things that really jump out at me.  First, though I agree with her position that reason should be the guide to human action and not feelings, this is a personal preference that we happen to share; there is no abstract necessity for mankind generally to choose reason.  And having so chosen, we both would opt for freedom as the primary value, but someone who has chosen the feelings as a guide to their ethics, would be justified, within the four corners of their ethos, in making a more mutual survival their primary value.  This is the difference, discussed here many times, between freedom and security, which I have argued has some correlation to gender.  Men, thanks to historical circumstances, and perhaps to biology, have tended to be more confident in their ability to survive and fend for themselves, and so have tended to come down on the side of freedom.  Women, understandably less confident, have favored security, that their survival might be assured even if it requires curtailing freedom in general.  To dismiss this countervailing viewpoint as irrational may even be true, but that does not delegitimize it.  If survival is the ethical purpose of every man, why shouldn't those who question their capacity to survive on their own seek to force others to help ?<br />The larger issue raised by Objectivism though is whether, even assuming an ideal world where the ethics could be applied absolutely, it suffices.  Would an existence wherein each of us was concerned solely with our own survival really be worth living ?  Even if it can be argued that we had arrived at the imperative to survive through a process of reasoning, would we be any better than animals ?  I think not.  And this is the most powerful criticism not merely of Objectivism but of pure reason, of capitalism, and of individualism in general : in the absence of any values external to man (presumably religious, but at least spiritual in some form), man's life or his freedom or his happiness are all standards arbitrarily adopted, and therefore not clearly superior to other standards which might otherwise be arbitrarily adopted.  So what makes my rational decision to choose freedom any better than the next person's emotional decision to choose forced sharing of resources ?  And suppose I get my freedom, what's the point if all I use it for is to further my own inevitably temporary survival ?  There have to be some broader purposes to human existence, don't there ?<br />Though life is indeed precious, the continued existence of each of us is simply not a fit measure for the meaning of our lives.  So in the end I find it easier to forgive Ayn Rand's stridency--her overbearing insistence on the primacy of the individual and individual concerns was appropriate to the time--than the narrowness of her vision.  Objectivism, like Existentialism, is ultimately too niggardly a philosophy for my tastes.  Freedom must be a means to get us somewhere, not an end in itself; otherwise it is simply one end among many that we might choose from.  We must raise our eyes from our own navels in order to find absolute meaning in our lives, but Objectivism stubbornly refuses to do so.<br />GRADE : B+ely of Objectivism but of pure reason, of capitalism, and of individualism in general : in the absence of any values external to man (presumably religious, but at least spiritual in some form), man's life or his freedom or his happiness are all standards arbitrarily adopted, and therefore not clearly superior to other standards which might otherwise be arbitrarily adopted.

She perceived the world in starkly Manichean terms, as a struggle between the forces of Light and Dark, Good and Evil. The Violent Bear it Away is a psychomachia--literally a battle for the soul--the story of a backwoods Southern boy named Francis Marion Tarwater (see The Violent Bear it Away and The Bible by Angela Lucey for more on this).  The boy's great uncle, an Old Testament style patriarch, kidnapped him away from an uncle, George Rayber, and has raised him to be a prophet of God.  Upon his great uncle's death, Tarwater rejects the prophetic mission and heads to the city to live with his uncle, who tries to wean the boy away from the teachings of the great uncle.  Through a series of increasingly violent actions Tarwater is eventual driven back to the woods and a final acceptance of God and his own role in God's plans.<br />This is powerful stuff, O'Connor felt that exaggeration and caricature were more likely to reach a modern audience than more subtle styles ever could.  Combine that with her vision of violence as a sort of crucible which forces the individual to make a final choice between Good and Evil, and you've got the makings of a truly disturbing fiction.  The book will surely not appeal to all tastes, but it is undeniably affecting and thought provoking.<br />GRADE: B-	2001-11-04

But it strikes me, reading the book twenty years after it was first published, how much the story depends on the reader to insert, South Africa, Apartheid, Afrikaners, blacks, etc. into the structure of the allegory in order for it to work.  Taken purely on it's own terms, the book is somehow too detached from the subjects under discussion to have too powerful an effect on us.  In some ways it just inhuman.  Other than the Magistrate, none of the characters seem more than caricatures.  The Empire is so distant and the barbarians so mysterious that we have no basis on which to judge the rival cultures.  Of course, we all find torture and repression repellent, but even such horrific methods may be a lesser evil than the system which the oppressed would impose were they to triumph over the oppressor.<br />The final impact of the novel then is paradoxical.  Where allegory typically universalizes a story, here it particularizes the tale.  It succeeds as an extended meditation on the moral obligations of an individual, especially an official,  who is uncomfortable about his nation's legal system and opposes the techniques used by his government.  It evens succeeds in convincing us that the Empire is making a mistake in torturing these victims.  But overall the story is so divorced from reality and has so few characters who resemble our fellow human beings that it has very little general applicability to the broader world outside the covers of the book.<br />Perhaps the best comparison is to George Orwell's magnificent short story, Shooting an Elephant.  Orwell takes one entirely specific, seemingly insignificant incident and convinces us that a system, Colonialism, which would require that he shoot an elephant merely in order to perpetuate the system itself, is perforce illegitimate.  He brilliantly extracts a universal message out of particular circumstances.  It's hardly fair to judge another author against such an exacting standard as George Orwell, but Coetzee's novel does conspicuously fail to achieve this kind of universality.<br />GRADE: B-rwell's magnificent short story, Shooting an Elephant.

She handles the facts of the story masterfully, rendering the potentially confusing bureaucratic history of the project in a narrative which is relatively easy to follow.  But she makes the ideology and politics which surround the story unnecessarily bewildering.  Here's a possibility that she seems never to have considered: Ronald Reagan and the supporters of SDI simply want to have a way to stop incoming nuclear missiles from detonating on American soil. (...)<br />To give Ms FitzGerald her due, the objector there yielded some points that she would not have, and that makes the book even more confusing.  For example, she maintains that President Reagan was sort of just a national salesman, albeit a great one.  The title of the book, in fact, comes from a Willy Loman speech in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman.<br />  Nobody dast blame this man.  You don't understand : Willy was a salesman.  And for a salesman<br />  there is no rock bottom to the life.  He don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you the law or give<br />  you medicine.  He's the man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine.  And<br />  when they start not smiling back--that's an earthquake.  And then you get yourself a couple of spots<br />  on your hat, and then you're finished.  Nobody dast blame this man.  A salesman is got to dream,<br />  boy.  It comes with the territory.<br />So her theory, or one of them, is that Reagan never really believed much in SDI and just proposed it out of desperation when he was doing poorly in the polls.  However, he sold himself and the country so well on the concept, that it refuses to die.  Of course, Reaganauts can't reveal all this, so the program requires an official mythology so there's this official version of the genesis of the idea for missile defense which involves Reagan having an epiphany during a 1979 visit to a NORAD base, when he realizes, reputedly for the first time, that we have no defenses against missile attack.  He is so troubled by this realization, that we lie naked before a nuclear aggressor, that he envisions a space shield.<br />The author gleefully goes about poking holes in this mythic tale (a tale which to the best of my knowledge she is the only one who believes is central to the history of the program) presenting counter evidence with fanfares and flourishes, seemingly unaware that the evidence she marshals weakens her own theories.  She makes a big deal of the fact that Reagan, when he had previously run for President, had often mentioned how intolerable he found the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction and it's requirement that we live in a state of nuclear terror.  This certainly puts the lie to the official story that she fabricated, but, more importantly, it indicates that, far from a function of political expediency, Reagan's dream of escaping the threat of nuclear weapons was long standing and very nearly central to his vision for his Presidency.  Apply Occam's Razor to Reagan's stated reason for building SDI and it turns out that his own words offer the simplest explanation.<br />This speech, the text of which FitzGerald would have done well to include in the book, not only addresses most of her arguments and makes her efforts to discern \\"real\\" motives seem silly, it effectively addresses the concerns we hear voiced most often about SDI today--cost, difficulty, reliability, threat to foes, uneasiness of allies, etc..  As was so often the case, Reagan seems to have been able to perceive the future and in this one address to the nation, at the very moment of conception of the program, he anticipated all of the attacks that SDI would meet, laid them before the American people himself and answered them.  What FitzGerald thinks of as a mere sales pitch, looks, to those like me, who support him, an awful lot like vision.  Make that big \\"V\\"ision.  Reagan simply saw further and with greater imagination than most other men, but especially than other political leaders.<br />Two other particularly annoying flaws show up in the book.  First is the author's insistence that Gorbachev, almost alone, is responsible for the end of the Cold War.  It is her thesis that Gorbachev came to power fully intending to destroy the Soviet Union and then set about in a rapid and organized fashion doing so.  She gives no credit to Reagan and is particularly dismissive of the role of SDI and other modern weapons programs in putting pressure on the Soviets.  She cites the fact that they failed to match our arms buildup as evidence that the Soviets were relatively unfazed by our increasing superiority.  One wishes she had at least considered the possibility that Reagan was right and that the Russia was already pushed to the edge and could not possibly keep up.  The failure to vastly increase their defense spending may simply reflect the fact that they were maxed out.  (Also, in light of the Afghan War, it is awfully hard to accept the numbers she cites which show fairly steady spending.  the war must have sucked up resources at some point.)<br />As to the credit she gives Gorbachev, it appears that she simply took his word for it.

Because in this society, it is not a good thing for an individual to discover new knowledge: &quot;This is a great sin, to be born with a head which is too quick.  It is not good to be different from our brothers, but it is evil to be superior to them.&quot;  So Equality 7-2521 and Liberty 5-3000 escape into the wilderness surrounding the city and, after renaming each other Prometheus and Gaea, begin to work out a philosophy where the self, the individual, is important.  Prometheus realizes:<br />  At first, man was enslaved by the gods.  But he broke the chains.  Then he was enslaved by the<br />  kings.  But he broke their chains.  He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race.  But he<br />  broke their chains.  He declared to all his brothers that a man has rights which neither god nor king<br />  nor other men can take away from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right of man,<br />  and there is no right on earth above this right.  And he stood on the threshold of freedom for which<br />  the blood of centuries behind him had been spilled.<br />  But then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his savage beginning.<br />  What brought it to pass?  What disaster took their reason away from men?  What whip lashed them<br />  to their knees in shame and submission?  The worship of the word &quot;We.&quot;<br />  ...<br />  Perhaps in those days, there were a few among men, a few of clear sight and clean soul, who<br />  refused to surrender [the word I.]  What agony must have been theirs before that which they saw<br />  coming and could not stop!  Perhaps they cried out in protest and in warning.  And they, these few,<br />  fought a hopeless battle, and they perished with their banner smeared by their own blood.  And they<br />  chose to perish, for they knew.  To them, I send my salute across the centuries, and my pity.<br />  Theirs is the banner in my hand.  And I wish I had the power to tell them that the despair of their<br />  hearts was not to be final, and their night was not without hope.  For the battle they lost can never<br />  be lost.  For that which they died to save can never perish.  Through all the darkness, through all<br />  the shame of which men are capable, the spirit of man will remain alive on this earth.  It may sleep,<br />  but it will awaken.  It may wear chains, but it will go on.  Man, not men.<br />Ayn Rand espoused a hard line capitalist philosophy which she called Objectivism--''the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute.''  During a period of years when one type of Collectivism or another (Socialism, Fascism, Communism) was regnant in virtually every nation in the West, she courageously swam against the tide of her time and demanded recognition of the primacy of the individual and of self interest as a force for good.  As a result, she has been ignored by the arts establishment, by philosophers and by political scientists, but she has a strong cult following and nearly every young person has, at least, a flirtation with her ideas.  There are legions of us who first read her in college and developed a ferocious intellectual crush on her for her iconoclasm and for the pure ferocity of her rhetoric.  Here, at last, was someone telling us that the liberal pabulum we had been spoon fed for the first 18 years of life was moral poison.  What a glorious moment when you discover that there are other people who, like you, think that individuals matter, that personal excellence should be celebrated, that anything that limits the rights and the abilities of individuals is evil.<br />One of the most telling indicators of the dichotomy between critics and the common folk is to compare her absence from the Modern Library Top 100 novels of the 20th Century list to the lofty placement of her novels on the lists where readers voted (i.e., Radcliffe's 100 Best Novels, Modern Library Readers' List &amp;  Koen Books Top 100)  The critics may not respect her much, but we of the hoi polloi sure seem to like her.  And, of course, Ms Rand has gotten the final laugh as it is her philosophy that has triumphed and, along with the careful tending of her acolyte and former boy toy Alan Greenspan, given the world a period of unprecedented economic growth and political freedom.  The continued refusal of the intelligentsia to acknowledge her, merely serves to make her accomplishment all the more remarkable.  When the dust has settled, a few decades or centuries from now, one assumes (okay, one hopes) that Keynes and Galbraith, Marx and Rawls, Dreiser and Lewis and Sinclair--all of the thinkers and writers of the failed Left--will have been consigned to oblivion and the names that are honored will be Hayek, Popper, Friedman, Orwell and Rand.  .<br />The sheer length of her two masterworks, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, makes rereading them a pretty daunting prospect.  They tend to be a little too hysterical, a little too repetitive and, with the end of the Cold War, they've lost a little of their edge.  But only a little, her essential message is still as important and timely today as it was fifty years ago--the only guarantee of freedom and human progress continues to be the individual acting in his own interest.  Every attempt to make one person work for another's benefit erodes all of our liberty and retards our progress as a society and a species.

The first is that Man had an ideal relationship with God in the Garden of Eden, which he ruined by eating the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge.  The subsequent interplay between Man and God since then consists of an elaborate attempt to reestablish that original Edenic bliss.  In this view, Man essentially makes himself worthy of God by returning to a passive, submissive role and yielding to God's will.<br />The alternative understanding of the story is that when God created Man he withheld two things from him: knowledge/reason and eternal life.  Having eaten from the Tree of Knowledge, Man acquired the capacity to reason and develop knowledge.  In order to make sure that Man did not also acquire the infinite lifespan in which to develop this knowledge, God banished him from the Garden.  In this view, Man is in the process of becoming God.  The subsequent relationship between Man and God consists of God putting obstacles in Man's way, like the multiplicicity of tongues as a result of the Tower of Babel, and man overcoming them.<br />The difference between these two views is stark and explains much of Western history.  The first view is a more spiritual and inspirational view; it is grounded in the emotions and the inchoate yearnings of human beings to be comforted.  It is a slave ideology, conveying the message that externalities are insignificant and what really matters is a personal relationship with God.  It requires no action on the part of Man, merely submission.  On the other hand, the second understanding is a call to action on the part of Man and a challenge to God.  It is an aspirational view, grounded on the belief that Man is perfectable.  It reflects the belief that through reason, increasing knowledge and expanding life spans, Man will one day be God's equal. In this context, Genesis is not a tragedy but a revolutionary manifesto.<br />All of which brings us to Martin Buber's I and Thou.  We had to read this in Philosophy and Religion my Freshman year at Colgate and I found it excrutiating reading.  Returning to it twenty years later has not helped.  Stripped of all the obtuse language, repetition and other kerfluffle, Buber's point is this:  humans are capable of two types of relationships, the I-It relationship is what we have with things or people whom we treat as objects.  The I-Thou relationship is the type of mutual relationship we have with some people and which he thinks we should have with God.  In the I-Thou relationship we recognize others as beings rather than things. (...)<br />Buber's concept of I and Thou, with it's emphasis on recognizing interrelations and dependencies and then immersing oneself in them, resembles Taoist or Buddhist ideas, but it also harkens back to the first reading of Man in the Garden of Eden above.  The goal is to experience this kind of completely internalized relationship with God.  It is, by and large, an attempt to comfort Man with the notion that it is in fact possible to enjoy such a relationship with mysterious spiritual forces which we can perceive in the world around us but which we can not understand through pure reason.  It is static, passive and wholly inner directed.<br />If I understand him properly, which I doubt, the following analogy might help:  think of Alexander Pope's image of the chain of being; in Buber's philosophy it suffices to recognize your place as a link in the chain and how you interlock with the other segments and that together you all form God's creation Through this realization, and acceptance of your role, you can then approach God.  Simply being and accepting being is enough.  It is this understanding of existence that has resulted in Buber being termed a religious existentialist.<br />Buber's theology though, like Existential philosophy, has been utterly rejected in Western culture and a good thing it is.  Instead we, by and large, believe in the infinite perfectability of Man.  We are not content to live out our existence as mere links in a chain; we believe that we can follow that chain to it's end and understand God's secrets, thereby becoming God ourselves. (...)It is easy to see how this activist, outer directed understanding of Man's role in the Universe has led to the ascendancy of Western Civilization.  While other peoples, believing in a Buberesque sufficiency of their current existence, have dithered away their days in purely spiritual and contemplative pursuits, we in the West have been driven by the idea of Progress.  Perhaps this is even the best term to oppose to Existentialism; our culture is, in nonpolitical terms, Progressive rather than Existential.  We refuse to just be, choosing instead a process of becoming, always becoming, whether that means becoming more intelligent, longer lived, or whatever.<br />At any rate, the book is still just godawful--impenetrable prose joined to silly ideas--and whoever decided that eighteen year olds should start out their college educations by being required to read it should be flogged.<br />GRADE: Fe, believe in the infinite perfectability of Man.

To begin with he stated the fundamental problem :<br />  Personal isolation is becoming a major social fact of our time.  A great many people are disturbed<br />  by the feeling that they are rootless or increasingly anonymous, that they are living in a continually<br />  changing environment where there is little sense of community.<br />He then identified several major traffic flows of the nation's populace.<br />He discussed the reasons for these phenomena, mostly employment related, and acknowledged the benefits that such mobility might arguably provide, but then he listed the negative effects of what he called the \\"Curious Life Styles of Loosely Rooted People\\"<br />Surprisingly, for it's age, even some of the book's remedies are still germane.  Packard called for : greater corporate responsibility to limit compulsory relocation of employees; people to work closer to their homes in order to be able to spend more time with their families and in their neighborhoods; people to acquire fixed second homes, vacation homes that the family would all return to regardless of where individual members were located; improvement of four year community colleges to encourage the young to stay closer to home during their college years; strengthening family ties, most controversial among the methods would be steps to salvage marriage and to reduce the growth of \\"one layer communities,\\" the types of massive retirement communities whose location you can see on the map in Florida, Arizona, and elsewhere--as he puts it, the self-segregation of older Americans represents a neglect of the responsibility to nurture and share wisdom, \\"independence at the expense of generational interdependence.\\"  The electoral evidence offers us a probable additional remedy that would help, removing the Social Welfare Net that makes such isolation feasible.<br />In these proposals, as in most of the book, Packard demonstrates a really canny understanding of problems that other people of the time had not even yet recognized.  It is well worth reading now, but one wishes it had been read and understood better then.  Had it been, that map might look a lot different and be a little less frightening.<br />GRADE : Ah isolation feasible. <br />In these proposals, as in most of the book, Packard demonstrates a really canny understanding of problems that other people of the time had not even yet recognized.

But after a while, the succeeding entries in the series (and in the Dirk Gently series) have a certain sameness.  It's not that they aren't funny, more that the unvarying tone and the set up of the jokes becomes, if not tedious, at least repetitive.  In 1988, however, Adams took his same skeptical view of existence on the road and went in search of some of the most endangered species on Earth and the resulting account of his adventures is fresh and very funny.<br />Adams and his &quot;coauthor&quot; (in a similar position someone once said, there is nothing more junior than being George Steinbrenner's junior partner), Mark Carwardine, who is a zoologist, traveled to Zaire to find the white rhino, to Indonesia looking for the giant Komodo lizard, New Zealand to see the kakapo (a nearly extinct bird), and so on.  The actual travelogue is filled with humorous incidents and Adam's wry observations.  From a trek with a freelance Kakapo tracker, to spending twenty hours at sea with a goat that's been dead for three days--the Komodos like them that way--to a flight with a Zairean pilot who leads passengers and crew in a prayer including the words &quot;we commend our lives into thy hands Oh Lord,&quot; there is ample opportunity for a skilled humorist and Douglas certainly is that.<br />His discussion of environmental, ecological and ethical issues however is disturbingly politically correct; he is unable or unwilling to unleash his sarcasm on the received wisdom of the Green crowd.  So here he is on the topic of Gorillas and Language:<br />  Why [try to teach apes language]? There are many members of our own species who live in and<br />  with the forest and know it and understand it. We don't listen to them. What is there to suggest we<br />  would listen to anything an ape could tell us? Or that he would be able to tell us of his life in a<br />  language that hasn't been born of that life?... Maybe it is not that they have yet to gain a language,<br />  it is that we have lost one.<br />It's so treacly it makes your molars hurt--we don't listen to the forest people, we wouldn't understand the gorillas and perhaps we don't deserve the wisdom they could share.  C'mon.  Prattlings like this, which are mercifully few, cry out for a humorist of his rank, perhaps P.J. O'Rourke, to respond.  One of the dangers of the form of relentless irony that characterizes Adams' writing is that you need to be ready to apply it to yourself as well.  It's sort of disorienting to go along with him as he essentially pokes fun at the entire Third World and then suddenly have him present these bourgeois envirocommunist platitudes with a straight face.<br />The broader issue implicated by the book is actually pretty interesting.  If we accept his figures, there are about 1.4 recognized million species and an estimated 30 million more still to be discovered.  We all know about the poster child extinctions--dodo birds, carrier pigeons, etc.--and entire species disappear every day, whether we notice or not.  The question arises: so what?  Dodo birds look cute enough, but how is the quality of our lives effected by their disappearance?  Rhinos are pretty cool looking but I'm never going to see one in person, what do I care if all that's left of them is the photographic evidence and written record which are already my sole experience of these beasts?  Adams offers up the typical twaddle about biodiversity, the ecosphere, the interconnectedness of life and all that jazz, but what about the extinctions we had nothing to do with, like the dinosaurs?  Obviously, even before we attained the power to cause mass extinctions they were occurring.  Why should we try to stop them now?  And if they are a natural occurrence, is it right for us to try to reverse the process.  Moreover, if you accept Darwin's theory of natural selection, hasn't mankind been selected?  If we want to open a chain of Kentucky Fried Kakapo restaurants, aren't we simply fulfilling nature's plan?<br />As I said, the book is very enjoyable and I strongly recommend it.  But the politics are just unexamined rubbish and because they are presented as gospel truths, are out of tune with the joyfully acidic tone of the rest of the book.<br />GRADE: A-lection, hasn't mankind been selected?

It's not that he's a conformist; we're all conformists of one kind or another; such is the nature of social creatures.  No, the problem with George Babbitt, that which has so incensed intellectuals for some eighty-odd years is the set of ideas that he conforms to : Middle American ideals--hard work, thrift, salesmanship, conservatism, Christianity, family values, monogamy, the whole panoply of traditional morays of which the Left is so contemptuous.<br />George's story is fairly simple.  A successful Realtor in the booming midwestern city of Zenith, married with three children, George is a pillar of the community and a support to his family, but he's not happy.  Everyone is always coming to him with their complaints about life, but he's never supposed to question his lot.  Then his friend, Paul Riesling, begins to express his own dissatisfaction and together the two begin to sow some wild oats.  George goes along on a trip to Maine without their wives, but eventually Paul sprints ahead by first having an affair and then shooting his wife.<br />George, who had tried reigning Paul in, now proceeds to have his own affair with the widow Tanis Judique.  He also starts to hang out with some of Tanis's scruffy friends and to vocally question the received wisdom of Zenith's business community.  But George's wife, Myra, finds out about the affair and George's business partners bail out on a few deals.  Meanwhile, George discovers that Tanis, though her life seemed freer at first, is just as bound by societal conventions as he.<br />With his own business now suffering and the bloom off of his new romance, George is already beginning to waiver, and when Myra comes down with a potentially deadly case of appendicitis, he realizes that he wants his old life back.  Myra and his friends welcome him back to the fold.<br />In a final scene, George's son elopes, and he surprises everyone by accepting the marriage.  He even tells the boy that he should seize his opportunities now, because he (George) never truly did anything he wanted to his whole life.<br />Now I understand that on the surface this does seem like an indictment of middle America, but it also reads like a cautionary tale, defending Zenith and its citizens from the notion that they'd be happier if they rebelled.  In fact, the most convincing and moving moments in the whole book come when George returns to Myra.<br />Likewise, perhaps the truest and certainly the funniest social criticism in the book is aimed not at the good people of Zenith, but at those who would change them.  When The Reverend Mike Monday, who might easily be nothing but a caricature of a huckster preacher, comes to town.<br />Sure, Lewis may have thought this was so over-the-top as to preclude the reader paying any heed to the message, or he may have meant it as nothing more than self-deprecating humor, but isn't it at least possible that he suspected we'd prefer this kind of muscular Christianity to the offerings of the lemon-sucking professors, maybe even that he himself preferred it ?  If Monday is supposed to be one of the bad guys, ask yourself this, outside of Richard III, when's the last time you recall the bad guy getting such funny lines at the expense of the good guys ?<br />At any rate, however Lewis intended us to take the story of George Babbitt and his abortive rebellion, the past eighty years have certainly vindicated the morality, even the hypocrisy, of Zenith and its most famous resident.

The following year he published this travelogue which remains one of the great books ever produced by an American and embarked him on a career as one of America&iacute;s first great historians.<br />On their trip, they were accompanied by Henry Chatillon, a hunter &amp; guide, and Deslauriers, a muleteer.  Parkman, in a passage which nicely illustrates his mastery of descriptive technique, sketches them as follows:<br />  Deslauriers was a Canadian, with all the characteristics of the true Jean Baptiste.  Neither fatigue,<br />  exposure, nor hard labor could ever impair his cheerfulness and gayety, or his politeness to his<br />  bourgeois; and when night came, he would sit down by the fire, smoke his pipe, and tell stories<br />  with the utmost contentment.  The prairie was his element.  Henry Chatillon was of a different<br />  stamp. When we were at St. Louis, several gentleman of the Fur Company had kindly offered to<br />  procure for us a hunter and guide suited for our purposes, and on coming one afternoon to the<br />  office, we found there a tall and exceedingly well-dressed man, with a face so open and frank that it<br />  attracted our notice at once.  We were surprised at being told that that it was he who wished to<br />  guide us to the mountains. He was born in a little French town near St. Louis, and from the age of<br />  fifteen years had been constantly in the neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains, employed for the<br />  most part by the company, to supply their forts with buffalo meat.  As a hunter, he had but one<br />  rival in the whole region, a man named Simoneau, with whom, to the honor of both of them, he<br />  was on the terms of closest friendship. He had arrived at St. Louis the day before, from the<br />  mountains, where he had been for four years; and he now asked only to go and spend a day with<br />  his mother, before setting out on another expedition.  His age was about thirty; and he was six feet<br />  high, and very powerfully and gracefully moulded. The prairies had been his school; he could<br />  neither read nor write, but he had a natural refinement and delicacy of mind, such as is rare even in<br />  women. His manly face was a mirror of uprightness, simplicity, and kindness of heart; he had,<br />  moreover, a keen perception of character, and a tact that would preserve him from flagrant error in<br />  any society.  Henry had not the restless energy of an Anglo-American. He was content to take<br />  things as he found them; and his chief fault arose from an excess of easy generosity, not conducive<br />  to thriving in the world.  Yet it was commonly remarked of him, that whatever he might choose to<br />  do with what belonged to himself, the property of others was always safe in his hands.  His bravery<br />  was as much celebrated in the mountains as his skill in hunting; but it is characteristic of him that in<br />  a country where the rifle is the chief arbiter between man and man, he was very seldom involved in<br />  quarrels.  Once or twice, indeed, his quiet good nature had been mistaken and presumed upon, but<br />  the consequences of the error were such, that no one was ever known to repeat it. No better<br />  evidence of the intrepidity of his temper could be asked, than the common report that he had killed<br />  more than thirty grizzly bears.  He was a proof of what unaided nature will sometimes do.  I have<br />  never, in the city or in the wilderness, met a better man than my true-hearted friend, Henry<br />  Chatillon.&quot;<br />Any man would consider his life well spent if he could inspire that portrait.

I'm not sure how long it was on the air, but for at least five years, Roseanne Barr's show was one of the most popular TV series in America.  Meanwhile, I personally would have only tuned in to watch her be fed, piece by large piece, into a woodchipper.  So I recognize the frequent possibility, even likelihood, that I am significantly out of step with popular opinion.  But let me say this, Bird by Bird, a memoir of the writing life by Anne Lamott reads as if it was written by Ms Barr.  Ms Lamott too is screechy, self-pitying, profane, and profoundly annoying.  She is one of those people who has made a complete hash of her own life--alcoholic, drug addict, bulimic, single mother, born again but calls God, Her, all the time--therefore, thinks that life is really difficult in general and that her's is especially trying, and for some reason thinks that we should all hear about it and that we have something to learn from her.<br />Now, I hardly consider myself prudish and I must acknowledge that one of my own most troubling character defects is a tendency to be excessively gutter-mouthed, but there is simply no excuse for Lamott's foul language in this book.  If an author is rendering dialogue in a novel, they must obviously use strong language in order to be realistic.  But here, in a book that is purportedly about writing, her frequent resort to swearing smacks of affectation and a forced attempt to keep the tone of the book chatty, rather than pedantic.  Instead, it is merely unprofessional.  What do we have to learn about writing, never mind life, from a woman who can't express herself without resorting to profanity?<br />The sole moment of pleasure in the book comes in the form of a rejection letter that an editor sent to her, in which he states:<br />  You have made the mistake of thinking that everything that has happened to you is interesting.<br />We can safely go one step further and say that the mistake lies in thinking that anything that has happened to her is interesting.

(Classic Seuss)	Books	5	4	7	N	N	a too brief respite	In recent weeks we've been deluged with a whole lot of harrumphing about how the new Grinch movie violates the true spirit of the blessed Dr. Seuss's original story, and about how the marketing campaign is a horrific manifestation of exactly the kind of commercialization that the tale is intended to combat.  But there's a deep dark secret that we all share : no one truly cares about the good Doctor's message : we love the Grinch who steals Christmas, not the one who returns it.  All those Whos down in Whoville are too annoying for us to care much whether they enjoy their holiday and the pre-conversion Grinch is so delightfully evil that we root for him, rather than against.  The Grinch succeeds, not because of its intended message, but because in the midst of all the saccharine of the Christmas season, we all welcome the sight of a total curmudgeon.  Think about it, our favorite characters in three great yuletide tales are Scrooge, the Abominable and the Grinch.  In every story, it's the anti-Christmas figure we're attracted to : to heck with Tiny Tim, the misfit toys and Cindy-Lou Who.<br />Don't get me wrong, I love Christmas, the whole deal--the baby Jesus, the presents, the food, family, friends, classic movies and tv shows, music, decorating the tree, etc., etc., etc...  But there's also that buzzardly part of me, and I bet of many of you, that needs an antidote, however temporary, to all of the artificial sentiment of the season.  I admit that I still mist up every time they sing Auld Lang Syne at the end of It's a Wonderful Life, but beats there a heart so sappy that it actually thrills to the strains of &quot;Fahoo Doray ?&quot;  No, the Grinch lives on because, until his heart grows those three sizes, he provides a brief respite from the hoopty-do of a holiday that takes not just commercialization but vacuous sentiment to an unbearable extreme..<br />GRADE : A-	2001-11-04

Cain was a genius is never more evident than when you watch other authors try to make a character's participation in his own degradation and his eager embrace of certain doom seem plausible.  In Ian McEwan's Comfort of Strangers, an unhappy British couple, Colin and Mary, are in the moidst of a perfectly horrid vacation in Venice when they meet Robert, a cheesy seeming, imitation disco king, Eurotrash, local bar owner.  He takes them under his wing and tells them the brutal but very amusing story of growing up with a domineering father who favors him and several bitterly jealous sisters.  Later he takes them back to meet his rather ephemeral, somewhat crippled wife, who tells them, as they are leaving, that she is Robert's prisoner.<br />For no apparent reason, this encounter rekindles the passion between Colin and Mary, though they studiously avoid discussing the episode and seek to avoid any subsequent meetings with Robert.  Inevitably, they do eventually see him again and the results are predictably ugly.<br />Stories like this one, which require the reader to suspend disbelief as the actors venture further and further into the abyss are extremely hard to pull off, so it's not surprising that McEwan doesn't quite manage it.  First off, Colin and Mary are so unsympathetic that, as in The Sheltering Sky which it in some ways resembles, we eagerly await the tourists getting their just desserts.  More troubling, Robert, despite his one captivating story, is so obviously shady that Colin and Mary seem totally stupid for getting involved with him.  An author can get away with making his characters naive, but at the point where the reader is yelling at them and calling them idiots for following along with the novel's plot, that author has lost control of his own narrative.<br />On the upside, the book offers further proof, as if any was needed, of the fundamental wisdom of the Time Zone Rule.  This holds that you should never, ever, under any circumstances, leave the Eastern Time Zone of the United States.<br />GRADE : C-ces, leave the Eastern Time Zone of the United States. <br />GRADE : C-	2001-11-04

For the first time he is freed from the moral influence of his parents and is left to his own devices, with disastrous results.  At first he is merely homesick, but:<br />  Later, as his 'homesickness' became less violent and gradually passed off, this, its real character,<br />  began to show rather more clearly.  For in its place there did not come the contentment that might<br />  have been expected; on the contrary, what it left in young Torless's soul was a void.  And this<br />  nothingness, this emptiness in himself, made him realise that it was no mere yearning that he had<br />  lost, but something positive, a spiritual force, something that had flowered in him under the guise<br />  of grief.<br />So here is this young man, his soul a void, no parental guidance to help fill the void, and he's just entered a community where he'll be surrounded by his similarly unformed peers.  It just doesn't seem likely that much good can come of this situation, nor does it.<br />The first attachment Torless forms is with a prince from a conservative and religious family, but they become estranged.  Subsequently, he experiments with mathematics, philosophy, sexual relations with the local whore, and several other pursuits, in an attempt to fill the void.  But, by far, his most important relationship is with two other boys, von Reiting and Beineberg, who have decided to start psychologically, physically and sexually abusing a classmate, Basini, whom they caught stealing money.  Beineberg assures Torless:<br />  You needn't be shocked, it's not as bad as all that.  First of all, as I've already explained to you,<br />  there's no cause to consider Basini's feelings at all.  Whether we decide to torment him or perhaps let<br />  him off depends solely on whether we feel the need of the one or the other.  It depends on our own<br />  inner reasons.  Have you got any?  All that stuff about morality and society and the rest of it, which<br />  you brought up before, doesn't count at all, of course.  I should be sorry to think you ever believed<br />  in it yourself.  So I assume you to be indifferent.<br />When Torless later joins in the degradation of Basini he does so for reasons of his own, but it is the character of Beineberg--and his eagerness to exercise power over other, \\"lesser\\", beings-- that has earned the book a reputation of having forecast the rise of Nazism.  But Torless does take advantage of Basini's situation and begins to exploit Basini for sexual purposes, though he tries to hide this from the other two boys.  This leads to a falling out amongst the little gang and the whole sordid story is exposed.<br />(...)It is interesting to contrast these books with works like To Kill a Mockingbird and The Chosen which depict how difficult it is to raise children so that they are morally centered even if you keep them at home.<br />Beyond this obvious level, the book can be read as a statement about the general attempt to replace traditional morality.  The moral decline that Torless lives out over the course of the novel essentially parallels the descent of modern man--initially cut adrift from family and religion, he passes through varying aspects of scientific rationalism, experiments with the pursuit of mere physical pleasure, and falls under the spell of Beineberg and his theory that all morality is a social construct, that each individual is free to follow his own whims.  Several times over the course of the novel, Musil assures us that Torless turns out okay in later life, that after this period of youthful confusion and experimentation, he grows into a sturdier adult.  One can only hope that the same will eventually be said of the species.<br />Musil was writing in the first full blush of Freudianism and the novel is somewhat marred by it's reliance on Freudian themes.  One hundred years ago, it may have seemed daring and honest to portray a young man's sexual fantasies about his mother; today, with Freud exposed as a quack and consigned to the ash heap of history, it simply makes Torless seem more aberrant than the author intended.<br />Still, it's an excellent introduction to the work of a really underrated author.  A Man Without Qualities, at least what I've read of it, is even better, a genuinely funny novel of Europe approaching the cataclysm of war and the destruction of the old order.<br />GRADE: Bm and the novel is somewhat marred by it's reliance on Freudian themes.

The recent boom in memoirs has produced a really fascinating phenomena, the true life tale which any intelligent reader knows to be fiction.  The most celebrated recent examples are books like Angela's Ashes, wherein Frank McCourt reconstructs his entire childhood and verbatim dialogue in such loving detail that we realize that his memoir is ultimately a fictional take on his own autobiography (see Orrin's review).  But in The Education of Little Tree we have an even more audacious author.  Forrest Carter's supposed memoir of being raised by his Cherokee grandparents after being orphaned at age 5, likewise recreates his youth in a level of detail that makes the story hard to credit, but in addition the characters he creates and episodes he relates defy belief.  The simple old Cherokee couple living at one with nature in a marriage of equals seems to be a purely mythic creation, but then when the five year old joins them and helps them outwit government bureaucrats, Christian missionaries, big city mobsters, etc., in between trips to the library to get the classics of Western Literature which Grandma reads aloud each night, you can really feel the text leaving any claim to a basis in reality behind.  Finally, as the story ends with Little Tree, now age 9, and his two loyal dogs, working their way across Depression America to get to the Cherokee Reservation, we've entered Cloud Cuckoo Land.<br />So I mentioned all of this to my Mom, who along with my brother urged this book upon me, and she said that she'd seen a People Magazine article about Carter a dozen years ago and it, naturally, turned out that the book is fiction.  A little quick research on the Web turns up the fact that it's not just fiction, it's virtually a hoax.  Carter was actually named Asa Carter.  He was a rabid segregationist who adopted the pseudonym Bedford Forrest, in honor of the Confederate general who founded the Klan.  He may or may not have been a speech writer for George Wallace, but he did claim to have written the infamous &quot;Segregation Forever!&quot; speech.<br />Now having said all that, there's one more thing that needs to be said about the book; it's terrific.  In many ways it reminded me of The Power of One, both are books of such surpassing beauty and heartwarming humanity, who cares if they are completely unrealistic?  Isn't one of the chief values of fiction the capacity to transcend reality?  The Education of Little Tree teaches timeless lessons about the value of family, education and place and it preaches an abiding mistrust of government.  If it also managed to snooker most of the touchy feely, do-gooder, Left, which desperately wishes that these were all Native American values, and not essentially Western ones, this merely allows us to enjoy it on a second level.  After all, it's not hard to make Oprah &amp; company look stupid, but it is fun.<br />GRADE:  Ae been a speech writer for George Wallace, but he did claim to have written the infamous &quot;Segregation Forever!&quot; speech. <br />Now having said all that, there's one more thing that needs to be said about the book; it's terrific.

Sadly, I do<br />have reservations.  There's much useful information in the book and it is illustrated beautifully, with<br />prints from Bill Goff's great art gallery, but Smith's storytelling style, which one assumes was intended<br />to come across as casual and conversational, is so slangy and unstructured that it sometimes fails to<br />make sense and, worse, feels like he's condescending to the audience.<br />Smith does not deserve all the blame for this, a decent editor could have saved him in the spots where<br />his prose becomes too tangled.  But just read this sentence :<br />  The New York Times' William Safire once likened Richard Nixon to a layer cake: To know him,<br />  you must imbibe each layer.<br />I couldn't find the quote, and I suppose it's possible that the word maven and fellow former<br />presidential speech writer put it just that way, but this is at best an unusual use of the word imbibe,<br />which generally refers to drinking not eating, and at worst is just plain bad English.  Even if Safire<br />said it, Smith should not have used it.  You sure as heck don't imbibe a layer cake and let's assume that<br />not even Safire imbibed Richard Nixon.<br />In the end, there's enough fresh material here about ballparks, and I like the overarching theme<br />enough, that I'd give the book a qualified recommendation.

I, of course, love The Catcher in the Rye, but when I tried reading Nine Stories, I was put off by them, so between that & his notorious silence, I just assumed Salinger was a one hit wonder.  Still, he's got a birthday coming up (1/01/1919) and I found the book for a dollar, so I figured what the heck.  Boy, am I glad.<br />The book consists of two interconnected stories from the Glass family series, originally published in The New Yorker; Franny is the youngest sister, Zooey the youngest brother.  All seven of the children were featured, each as they came of age, on a radio program called \\"It's a Wise Child\\", where:<br />  In general, listeners were divided into two, curiously restive camps: those who held that the Glasses<br />  were a bunch of insufferably \\"superior\\" little bastards that should have been drowned or gassed at<br />  birth, and those who held that they were bona-fide underage wits and savants, of an uncommon, if<br />  unenviable, order.<br />I wavered between these two opinions, though leaning towards insufferable, through the first story, Franny (1955), which concerns Franny's visit to her college boyfriend as she teeters on the edge of a breakdown, and the first three quarters of Zooey (1957), which opens with an extended scene featuring the visiting TV star Zooey taking a bath and arguing with his mother as she tries to convince him to help Franny, who is continuing her breakdown on the family couch, having abandoned acting class.  It seemed that these characters were simply Holden Caufields a little farther along in life--precocious, bright and charming, but hypersensitive to the point of neuroses.  But then all of a sudden, when Zooey does intervene, the story really takes off.<br />Franny, who shares with Zooey and her other siblings (and with Holden Caufield) an exasperation with the inadequacies of all those around her and with the problems of the world in general, has become fascinated by the works of a Russian mystic who advocates endless repetition of a certain Jesus Prayer as a means of getting in touch with God.  (...)<br />This beautiful revelatory story is so suffused with empathy, humanity and spirituality, I had very nearly the same reaction as Franny.  Zooey/Salinger has offered a way out of Franny's/Holden's/our' dilemma: the dissatisfaction with the seeming shortcomings of the world and the people around us.  First, we must let go of our obsession with the failings of those around us; we can not be, nor should we try to be, catchers in the rye, trying to save or change everyone.  Second, we must polish them for the Fat Lady; seek to live our lives perfectly, that we may be worthy of the audience, Christ Himself.<br />If you have ever read and enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye, you owe it to yourself to read this book, an extended coda which, in effect, completes Holden's tale.  It is one of the most moving and profoundly Christian works I've ever read.

What's really disappointing is how derivative and hackneyed it all is.  Boyle takes equal parts Grapes of Wrath, Bonfire of the Vanities, Down and Out in Beverly Hills and Grand Canyon, mixes them together and pours out a batch of completely predictable, politically correct pabulum.<br />Delaney Mossbacher is contemptible yuppie scum.  He lives in a gated development, Arroyo Blanco Estates, in Southern California's Topanga Canyon with his equally vile wife and her rotten son.  Delaney is a nature writer in the mode of Annie Dilliard (see Orrin's review).  He considers himself to hold all the \\"proper\\" (i.e., \\"liberal humanist\\") views on social issues, but these views are put to the test when he strikes an illegal alien with his Acura.<br />The immigrant, Candido Rincon, is hiding out in the canyon, teetering on the verge of starvation, with his pregnant young wife, America.  He is pretty badly injured in the accident, but terrified of Immigration authorities, he accepts twenty dollars in cash and stumbles off into the canyon.  At first Delaney is horrified by what has happened, but eventually he convinces himself that the victim was running some kind of scam and that he, Delaney, is the true victim because of the damage to his car.  This begins a slide--featuring stolen cars, house pets eaten by coyotes, vandalism, wildfires, and so on--which eventually turns Delaney into a leaden parody of a gun toting right wing extremist.  Meanwhile, the Rincons have visited upon them a series of near Biblical plagues--rape, fire, blindness, near slavery, flood, slaughter of the first born, and so on; at one point Boyle even compares them to Job, just in case we've missed the point.<br />Boiled down to its essentials, the novel portrays the fabulous comfort of the Mossbachers and their neighbors, while poking fun at their anxieties.  They are contrasted with the achingly noble Rincons and the myriad degradations they suffer while searching for a better life in America.  The ultimate irony, of course, is that the lifestyle enjoyed by the Mossbachers and their ilk is made possible by the labor of folks like the Rincons.  Here again, Boyle, apparently believing that his point may be too subtle for us, uses the final scene of the novel to hammer it home.<br />There are two problems with Boyle's approach, one structural, the other ideological.  Structurally, satire with it's dependence on exaggeration and caricature requires one of two things; either that the author be sympathetic to all of his characters or to none.  If the author feels at least some affection for all of his targets then his essentially unfair portrayal of them comes with a wink and a nod, letting us know that the satire is merely a means to and end.  If he genuinely loathes them all and attacks them with equal ferocity, there is at least some kind of cosmic justice at work.  The one thing that the author can not do, but which Boyle does do here, is to establish a dichotomy where some characters are satirized viciously, while others are nearly canonized.  This imbalance leads to what must surely be an unintended consequence, since the \\"bad\\" people can't really be that bad and the \\"good\\" people can't really be that good, the reader ends up feeling empathy for the wrong characters.  In this case, Boyle is so harsh towards the Mossbachers and so enamored of the Rincons that the Mossbachers seem like the victims of the piece, victims of the author that is.<br />The ideological problem with the book lies in Boyle's one sided depiction of the immigration argument.  Personally, I don't have much problem with the basic point that immigrants, legal and otherwise, serve a vital role in our society.  I believe that anyone who wants to come to America should be welcomed and offered the full protection of our labor laws.  The only requirement should be that they work and that they be ineligible for any government benefits until theybecome citizens.<br />However, I do understand the view point of those who oppose immigration.  It is undeniably difficult to assimilate these new populations into the broader society and it can cause disruption to existing communities.  Moreover, the presence in the economy of people who are willing to do practically any job must inevitably have the eventual effect of holding down wages generally.  Finally, though Boyle is especially dismissive of this argument, it is troubling that America has lost control of its own borders.  The inability to stem the flow of illegals across the Mexican border is nearly as alarming as our abject failure to stop the traffic of illegal drugs into the country.  Although I believe that the benefits of immigration outweigh them, I'd concede that each of these points is valid.  Boyle simply dismisses them out of hand.<br />Just as bad as his ham-handed presentation of this complex issue is his complete misunderstanding of the immigrant experience.  It is of course true that immigrants have a hard time in their new countries.  This has always been the case.  Four hundred years ago, white settlers were frequently slaughtered by Indians.  No matter how hard they have it, today's immigrants don't run much risk of being scalped, do they?  But the fundamental truth of the immigrant experience is not how hard their new lives are; it is that they fled lives that were worse and that their children have lives that are better.

It is undeniably difficult to assimilate these new populations into the broader society and it can cause disruption to existing communities.  Moreover, the presence in the economy of people who are willing to do practically any job must inevitably have the eventual effect of holding down wages generally.  Finally, though Boyle is especially dismissive of this argument, it is troubling that America has lost control of its own borders.  The inability to stem the flow of illegals across the Mexican border is nearly as alarming as our abject failure to stop the traffic of illegal drugs into the country.  Although I believe that the benefits of immigration outweigh them, I'd concede that each of these points is valid.  Boyle simply dismisses them out of hand. <br />Just as bad as his ham-handed presentation of this complex issue is his complete misunderstanding of the immigrant experience.  It is of course true that immigrants have a hard time in their new countries.  This has always been the case.  Four hundred years ago, white settlers were frequently slaughtered by Indians.  No matter how hard they have it, today's immigrants don't run much risk of being scalped, do they?  But the fundamental truth of the immigrant experience is not how hard their new lives are; it is that they fled lives that were worse and that their children have lives that are better.

Willy Loman never made a lot of money. His name was never in the<br />  paper.  He's not the finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is<br />  happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old<br />  dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a person<br />  -Linda Loman, Act 1, Death of a Salesman<br />Why must attention be paid?  Since the play's debut, amazingly over 50 years ago now, that has been the central question : must we pay attention to the demise of Willy Loman?  Even Willy's name seems to be a gauntlet thrown down in the face of the critics.  Where traditional tragedy deals with the high born, the fall of royalty, Arthur Miller quite consciously structures his drama around the fall of a lowly man, a two-bit salesman.  But the answer to the question, as is so often the case, is all in how you ask it.<br />You see, if the question is, can the life and death of a salesman be tragic?, then, of course, the answer is yes it can.  Nor does it require that he be a &quot;great&quot; man, but it does require that he be a good man.  The problem with trying to imbue this play with the aura of tragedy is not that Willy Loman is a little man, it's that he's not a good man : he's not much of a salesman; he cheats on his wife; he lives vicariously and unfairly through his eldest son, Buck, then makes excuses for that son's pathological misbehavior; he virtually ignores his second son; he's a real bastard to friends, neighbors and extended family; and so on.  Perhaps I missed something, but what quality is it in Willy that should make us regret his departure?<br />Arthur Miller, who is one of the last unrepentant Marxists, obviously sees Willy as a victim of capitalism.  Willy has bought into the American Dream and it has destroyed him; after a lifetime of toil in the system, he is being disposed of now that he is no longer productive.  The problem with this is that, much like Jay Gatsby (see Orrin's review), Willy has simply failed to understand the promise of that dream.  He believes that the recipe for success is to be &quot;impressive&quot; and &quot;well-liked&quot; and for your children to be identical to you in manner and aspiration.  Toward that end, he is all back-slapping, forced humor, pretense, and bluster and he demands the same of his poor benighted sons.  One doesn't really expect an intellectual to have any real understanding of economics (or much else for that matter) but Miller, in reducing capitalism to nothing more than a kind of cheap hucksterism, has followed in the footsteps of Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the like, with equally obtuse results.<br />It is the genius of capitalism that chaff like the Loman's are ruthlessly winnowed.  Willy and his sons are so transparently phony it makes your flesh crawl just listening to them.  It's not as if Willy had been steadily advancing through the business world and then suddenly hit the wall.  He's spent forty years on the lowest rung of the corporate ladder for a reason.  That reason?, he has been judged inadequate, long before his age caught up to him.  This is a man who should have been a gym teacher and an athletics coach.  But not only has he deluded himself and ignored forty years of messages from the system, he also insists that his sons follow in his clearly misguided footsteps.<br />It is perhaps most instructive to compare Willy Loman to George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life.  George is a truly talented young man who yearns to escape his hometown and put his skills to use elsewhere.  A series of external circumstances intervene and he never gets out, but he does build a vital local business, has a loving family and myriad friends.  Facing economic ruin, through no fault of his own, he despairs that he's worth more dead than alive, but realizes, with the help of a guardian angel, that he's helpedhundreds of people and that his selflessness has had a profound effect on those around him.  He decides not to commit suicide and throngs of friends and customers turn up to help him out of his fix.  He's really had a wonderful life.<br />The narrative structure of Death of a Salesman is even similar, though Miller, perhaps unwisely, eschews the angel.  But as Willy looks back over his life, he sees, not a series of charitable acts, but a series of selfish acts.  When Willy finally does kill himself, there are hardly any mourners, and one has to ask whether even those who are there won't be better off with him gone.<br />This play is really a relic of the short, unhappy period in the 30's and 40's when American intellectuals had been seduced by Marxism.  It is too doctrinaire in it's assumptions about democracy and capitalism to actually say anything of lasting value.  You know how there are periodic attempts to ban the teaching of certain books in public schools?  Well, I had teachers who taught both this play and The Crucible, that equally morally flaccid piece of tripe and let me just say this : as a parent, I just don't want some nitwit teacher trying to explain this Stalinist propaganda to my kids and telling them that it offers some kind of profound analysis of our society.  If folks think it's important to expose kids to authors who critique capitalism and the American Dream, at least let them read The Great Gatsby, which, though wrong also, is at least great literature.<br />GRADE : Fangel, that he's helped hundreds of people and that his selflessness has had a profound effect on those around him.

I would urge every American to read it.  There are not simply subplots in the life of The Lone Eagle, there are at least three totally separate major plots, a leit motif or even two and then various subplots:<br />THE PLOTS<br />1) First, of course, is the solo flight from New York to Paris on May 20-21, 1927.  Beyond the historic nature of the achievement, is the fact that Lindbergh himself was involved in every step of producing the airplane, The Spirit of St. Louis, and planned the entire thing virtually by himself.<br />2) The Kidnapping.  To a generation grown weary watching Court TV, OJ, the Killer Nanny, etc., it may be hard to remember that there once was a real Trial of the Century.  The disappearance of the Lindbergh Baby, the search for the killers, the trial and subsequent conspiracy theories all blend together in a horrifying sequence of events.<br />3) America First:  Many people still recoil at the mere mention of Lindbergh's name and mistakenly remember him as a Nazi.  His leadership of America's isolationists did tremendous and lasting damage to his reputation.  I'll return to this topic.<br />THE LEIT MOTIFS<br />1) Lindbergh achieved his fame at a moment in time which made him both one of the last heroes of the age of Exploration and the first celebrity of the Media Age.  Only the astronauts remained to be placed in the pantheon of explorers and their accomplishments were so much driven by technology and bureaucracy, that they were inevitably somewhat diminished.  And noone had ever had to face the glare of media attention that greeted Lindbergh after his flight.  He was famous in a sense that had never been seen and was, perhaps, never seen again.  Parisians spontaneously flooded the field where he landed.  One in three New Yorkers turned out for the parade that greeted him.  He was made offers totaling some $5 Million at a time when the country was plunging into Depression.  His every move was news.  Every word was scrutinized; every action analyzed.  For the remainder of his life, this celebrity would be a boon and a bane, but it would always be inescapable.<br />2) Throughout his whole life, from college to the grave, Lindbergh was one of the prime movers in the field of aviation.  Besides his historic flight, he served on numerous Corporate, Government and private boards and committees to foster and improve aviation speed, safety and efficiency.<br />3) His marriage to Anne Morrow was complex, tragic, glorious, productive--you pick an adjective, it probably fits.  Just the story of the relationship between these two remarkable people could fill a book<br />THE SUBPLOTS<br />  Along the course of this incredible life, Lindbergh also won a Pulitzer for his book The Spirit of<br />  St. Louis, developed a pump that revolutionized major organ surgery, shot down a Japanese<br />  fighter plane, met Presidents, royalty, dictators, etc. and due to the unique combination of his<br />  celebrity and his mobility he saw Hiroshima from the air, Holocaust remains, the Apollo 11<br />  launch, and so on.<br /><br />All of these things make for fascinating reading.  Sections like the flight and the kidnapping are as exciting as any novel.  But, of course, the section that grips our attention is the America First period.  Was he or wasn't he? A Nazi that is.<br />There is something truly perverted about the fact that this question even arises.  Recently there have been a number of stories about how labeling Milosevic, or Saddam for that matter, a Hitler and making charges of genocide, removes our capacity to reason about and discuss events.  In the same way, the viscious and baseless charges of Nazi sympathizer, anti-Semite, traitor, and so on, ad nauseum, that were lodged by men like FDR and Harold Ickes and many others, have long made it impossible to discuss Lindbergh, America First and the isolationist movement logically.  Berg remedies this unfortunate fact in an even handed and straight forward account of the events.<br />A number of factors combined to push Lindbergh in the direction of isolationism.  His father had been an isolationist congressman during WWI.  His parents chaotic marriage and his own wanderlust lead him to place an elevated premium on order and he thought that he had found a well ordered society in Nazi Germany.  His tours of their airbases and plane factories had impressed him and left him believing that they would be a more formidable foe than anyone else realized.  He always expressed bewilderment at the Nazi obsession with the Jewish problem, but he never understood the degree to which it would overtake them and lead to the Holocaust.  In fairness, who did realize it then?  Finally, he perceived the Soviet Union as a significant and permanent threat to Europe and the West.  He felt that destroying Germany would leave an exhausted Europe prostrate at the feet of the Communists.<br />For all of these reasons, he called upon Americans to stay out of the War, rearm America into an impregnable fortress and let the Nazis and the Communists tear away at one another.<br />But along with these sentiments, he also perceived the world in racial terms.  He feared the Communists more than the Nazis because in the end, the Nazis were German and Western and when Hitler was gone they would return to their senses.  But the Communists were Russian and semi-Asiatic and were fundamentally Eastern, not Western.  In the same sense, he spoke of Jews as a race and inevitably, he eventually became entangled in verbal thickets that he could not escape.  In the speech that forever marked him as an anti-Semite, when he was trying to describe what groups of people were pushing the U.S. towards war, he said the following:<br />  It is not difficult to understand why Jewish people desire the overthrow of Nazi Germany.  The<br />  persecution they suffered in Germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race.  No<br />  person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution of the Jewish race in<br />  Germany.  But no person of honesty and vision can look on their pro-war policy here today<br />  without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy, both for us and for them.<br />  Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every<br />  possible way, for they will be among the first to feel its consequences.  Tolerance is a virtue that<br />  depends upon peace and strength.  History shows that it cannot survive war and devastation.  A<br />  few far-sighted Jewish people realize this, and stand opposed to intervention.  But the majority<br />  still do not.  Their greatest danger to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our<br />  motion pictures, our press, our radio and our Government.<br />  I am not attacking either the Jewish or the British people.  Both races, I admire.  But I am saying<br />  that the leaders of both the British and Jewish races, for reasons which are understandable from<br />  their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to<br />  involve us in the war.  We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own<br />  interests, but we must look out for ours.  We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of<br />  other peoples to lead our country to destruction.<br />This sense of Jewish otherness was seized upon by interventionists in politics and the press, and, along with his use of the classic anti-Semitic theory about inordinate Jewish influence in the media and government, enabled them to smear him as a Nazi.<br />To our eyes, the easy reference to races of people seems odd.  Noone considers the British a race anymore.  But this racialism was common at the time.  Indeed, few men have ever written and spoken about race as vehemently as Winston Churchill.  But theimplication that somehow Jews weren't Americans was simply too inflammatory and with Roosevelt and the Eastern establishment champing at the bit to get into the war, Lindbergh had handed them a weapon with which to pummel him.  They gladly used it.<br />Now, it should give us some pause to consider that:<br />1) Woodrow Wilson set us on the course to having ethnicity be the determining factor in statehood.<br />2) FDR, within a year, was rounding up Japanese Americans and sending them to Concentration Camps.<br />3) FDR's Democrat party oversaw the venomous system of Jim Crow laws in the South<br />4) Following the war, Israel was founded as a Jewish homeland and even today, Israel does not consider a person Jewish unless they are borne of a Jewish mother, making Jews a de facto race.<br />5) Today, in Europe NATO is bombing Slavic Christian Serbs to benefit Albanian Moslems.  And in America, race is once again a determining factor in getting a job or a government grant.<br />None of this excuses Lindbergh's ill considered language about Jews.  But it does raise the question of why he is the one who is dogged by the reputation of being an anti-Semite and a Nazi.  When you think of FDR, your first thought is not: &quoticient to make bitter enemies of any race.

Carter defines the concept of civility :<br />  Civility involves the discipline of our passions for the sake of living a common life with others...<br />The notion, in this age of the self, that we should each yield something of our own feelings and desires in order to accommodate others is nearly heretical.  Add to that the idea that, at a time when the siren call for \\"diversity\\" has swept the intellectual classes, it is either possible or desirable to speak of a \\"common life\\", and you can see why civility is on the outs.<br />Mr. Carter, of Yale Law School, who frequently writes about religion, rightly perceives that the danger in our jettisoning civility as a social value is not merely that the culture becomes coarser and less pleasant, but that we lose the lubricant that helps the engine of democracy run more smoothly.  He lists five reasons that a democracy should value civility (...)<br />Professor Carter proceeds to look at how almost all of our institutions have helped contribute to the current atmosphere of incivility and considers how they might help to restore a climate of civility.  (...)<br />In the process though, he misses one rather enormous point, one which explains much that he's troubled by : the creation and continued existence of a massive Federal bureaucracy.  We live today in a society where the government exercises control over virtually every aspect of our lives.  In a very real sense, we have replaced morality and civility with legality.  Carter is absolutely correct that a healthy liberal democracy requires that people share the same moral standards and that they acknowledge common rules of etiquette and manners.  This kind of democracy, which values freedom above all other ends, must have a citizenry which regulates itself, otherwise people can not trust one another.  And, of course, as the Constitution with its intricate scheme of checks and balances so amply demonstrates, even then you don't want to trust anyone too much when it comes to political power.<br />The America which now enters the 21st Century is simply not that kind of democracy anymore.  If freedom has not been entirely displaced as the ultimate value in society, it has at least been surpassed by equality.  Moreover, the ideal of equality that has been elevated is the radically egalitarian equality of results, as opposed to the equality which the Founders celebrated, the equality of men before their Creator.  Achieving this new kind of equality requires that freedom be restricted--it is obvious that equality is never produced in a world of Social Darwinism--in order to allow government to grant special advantages to the less able or to actually transfer wealth to them, so that, regardless of our differing levels of talents, intelligence, gumption, etc., we will all end up with roughly equal living standards.<br />It goes without saying that once you start granting government these types of powers, it won't stop at this rather limited, although still repressive, goal.  So the government has taken on ever greater powers to regulate our commercial and private lives, until today it tells the businessman how many parts per billion of pollutant he may emit and how many minorities he must employ, while telling all of us how many gallons of water our toilet bowls can use.<br />Given this essentially authoritarian system, where even the minutiae of everyday life is regulated by a powerful central authority, it is little wonder that the belief systems which we had previously internalized to regulate our own behavior have fallen into disuse.  In a world where most things are technically legal, we have to ask ourselves whether they are right or wrong, otherwise we can not live in harmony with one another.  In a world, as today, in which so many things are illegal, it is only natural to assume that those which have not been expressly forbidden must be allowed.  Perhaps it is just too much to ask a people whose entire lives are governed by laws, regulations, and the constant threat of lawsuits, to also adopt standards of civility, simply because it's the right thing to do.  After all, if manners really mattered, wouldn't there be Federal laws requiring them, a cabinet department in charge of them, and special interest groups to lobby for them ?<br />This odd phenomenon also explains why the Left tends to be so hostile to the idea of civility, and why it is the Right which generally engages in hand wringing over civility's demise.  Civility and morality have been replaced by the legalisms of the Social Welfare state.  Those of us who wish for a return to old-fashioned civility and morality should be forthright and acknowledge that we also want to roll back the Leviathan that the Federal government has become.  We should express our faith in our fellow men, our much greater faith than that of our opponents, faith that people are capable of regulating their own behavior without government doing it for them.<br />There is much confusion, on the Left and on the Right, about what the conservative belief in freedom really entails.  Libertarians assume that freedom necessarily includes the right to engage in almost any consensual behavior.  Liberals assume that free market ideology is a cover for allowing businesses to commit any predation, to exploit anyone, and that unfettered capitalism is little more than an appeal to our most selfish instincts.  Religious conservatives (or cultural conservatives) share both these fears.  But the fact is that freedom of the type that the Founders sought to secure, and which the fairly minimalist republic they founded presupposes, requires a populace which is ideologically homogenous and bound by a common morality and manners.  It is understood that people will not need every aspect of life dictated to them, because their shared cultural heritage of Judeo-Christianity will inform their moral lives.  It's little wonder then that the Left, which is necessarily hostile to the kind of unobtrusive republican democracy that was created here is also hostile to the morality and civility which made it possible.<br />Unfortunately, this is further than Stephen L. Carter is willing to look.  His effort in this book, and it's certainly worthwhile, though inadequate, is too make the current American polity more civil.  For obvious reasons, in a book about how we all need to respect and listen to each other, he's reluctant to declare that you need to destroy the village to save it, but such may indeed be the case.  The revival of morality, religiosity, and civility is unlikely to come about until we tear down the superstructure of legality which is currently strangling our society.  Counterintuitive as it may sound, the best way to restore the sense of decency, the willingness to sacrifice for others, and the respect for fellow citizens--the love of our neighbors of which Carter speaks--is to get government laws and regulations out of our way.  These external restraints, however well intended, have tended to absolve us of moral responsibility for one another and for our own actions.  Far better to dispose of the artificial intermediaries between us and return once again to a culture where people are expected to develop internal restraints and a sense of responsibility.  Otherwise, limited prescriptions like the ones that Professor Carter offers here can do little more than try to treat a few symptoms, rather than the ultimate cause, of a potentially deadly disease.<br />GRADE : B-not been expressly forbidden must be allowed.

His eyes seemed hooded in the shadow of the hat's brim.  He came closer, and I<br />  could see that this was because the brows were drawn in a frown of fixed and habitual alertness.<br />  Beneath them the eyes were endlessly searching from side to side and forward, checking off every<br />  item in view, missing nothing.  As I noticed this, a sudden chill, I could not have told why, struck<br />  through me there in the warm and open sun.<br />Well, we all know why that chill ran through little Bob as Shane rode up to the Starrett homestead in the Wyoming Territory in the summer of 1889, because Shane was a lethal, albeit reluctant, gunslinger.  This slender American classic tells the story, familiar to every cultured American from the great George Stevens' movie (1953), of how Shane, fleeing a mysterious but obviously violent past, was befriended by the Starretts and stayed on to help them fight off the predatory intentions of the valley's big rancher and his evil henchmen.  It is a story that is central to the American mythos.<br />The great Westerns penetrate deep within the American psyche; they strike a chord that lies somewhere within our national character, just waiting to be plucked.  I believe that their unique power derives from a truly elemental facet of democracy--that in order for men to enjoy the freedom that a democracy allows, they must be able to depend on the fundamental goodness of their fellow men.  An unyielding, self enforcing morality is a prerequisite for a political system based on liberty; men are unwilling to limit the coercive power of government when they live in fear of one another.<br />Certainly the Western and the code of the West represent a sanitized and romanticized view of the Frontier and the men who tamed it, but it is a romance that serves the democratic purpose.  These morality tales are instructive and aspirational.  Of course men like Shane are archetypes in a kind of a national myth making:<br />  There were sharp hidden hardnesses in him.  But these were not for us.  He was dangerous as<br />  mother had said.  But not to us as father too had said.  And he was no longer a stranger.  He was a<br />  man like a father in whom a boy could believe in the simple knowing that what was beyond<br />  comprehension was still clean and solid and right.<br />This is a little boy's impossible view of a hero, but here we see that the character of Joe Starrett is equally important.  Joe Starrett is a simple sod farmer, but he is kind and decent and honest and courageous, the equal of Shane in every respect except for speed on the draw.  Joe is the true yeoman hero of this tale and one of the duties that Shane performs is to demonstrate this fact to young Bob (and to us).<br />Stories like Shane are a product of a time when Americans genuinely believed in democratic ideals and in the American Dream.  They express our native confidence that we can produce men who will measure up these standards.  It is no coincidence that the Western died in the mid-60's along with the sense of confidence in our national purpose.  It is also unsurprising that it was Ronald Reagan, that hero of myriad Westerns, who stanched the bleeding and made people believe again, however briefly.<br />Here is just one other example of the instructive nature of these stories.  This is Shane, teaching Bob to shoot:<br />  &quot;Listen, Bob.  A gun is just a tool.  No better and no worse than any other tool, a shovel--or an axe<br />  or a saddle or a stove or anything.  Think of it always that way.  A gun is as good--and as bad--as<br />  the man who carries it.  Remember that.&quot;<br />Think of the level of personal responsibility that this attitude assumes.  Contrast it with the near fascist drive to abolish gun rights today.  The underlying argument of the forces of gun control is that guns are evil in and of themselves, regardless of the men who wield them.  This is part and parcel of the Democrat myth of the '90s.  Which do you think is more likely to foster good citizenship, holding guns responsible for violence or holding men responsible?<br />As for me, I choose the classic Westerns and the democratic ideals that they convey, over the moral relativism that permeates our current culture.<br />GRADE: A+s are evil in and of themselves, regardless of the men who wield them.

So it is entirely possible that other readers will not enjoy this slender but potent novel of ideas as much as I did.  But, because I agree with so many of the concepts contained within and with the central premise on which it is based, I really thought it was extraordinary.<br />The narrative structure of the book is deceptively simple.  James Cowan claims to have found the journal of the 15th century Venetian cartographer Fra Mauro.  Within the pages of the journal, Mauro describes his work on what he hopes will be his masterpiece, a great mappa mundi (world map) that will contain everything that he knows about the geography of the world (the map pictured above is actually not the map described in the book, but instead the only known surviving Mauro map).  The irony, of course, is that Mauro lived in the monastery of San Michele di Murano and was not himself a traveler or explorer.  His definitive map was to be based on knowledge acquired by and from others.  The journal describes visits he received from individuals who had actually traveled abroad and were interested in sharing their knowledge with him.<br />Now I spend a lot of time in these reviews unabashedly arguing for the supremacy of Western Civilization--its Culture: music, literature and the plastic arts; Political and Social Institutions; Economic System; Scientific advances; etc..  And it seems to me that there is one great achievement that is really central to all of the achievements or, at the very least, has facilitated all of them; that is the development of means to systematize, retrieve and pass on knowledge.  It should be obvious on its face that no culture that failed to produce a written language can lay any claim to even being a true Civilization.  Even those which developed languages, but failed to develop knowledge or failed to accumulate and preserve knowledge, can hardly claim to be great Civilizations.  And those which made developed some capacity to further knowledge and to safeguard the results for the use of subsequent generations, but failed to disseminate such knowledge widely, must pale by comparison too.  For what we in the West achieved was a set of systems for accumulating knowledge, experimenting in order to increase that knowledge, storing and sharing that knowledge widely and a series of religious and political theories to induce citizens to strive to further all of these achievements.<br />So it is that an early map maker like Fra Mauro, cloistered within his cell, can take on such a heroic aura and his story can be so exciting.  And here are some of the passages where Cowan develops some of these same ideas:<br /><br />-----<br />  Mauro is visited by an elderly Jew of Rhodes, who tells him:<br />  It is in us all, this desire to experience the kinship that exists between our innermost being and the<br />  will that created such a kinship in the first place.  As such a desire is realized, we become<br />  preoccupied with strange and uncanny aspects in Nature herself.  We are almost tempted to regard<br />  them as our own moods, our own creations.  For my part, I know that the boundary between<br />  myself and Nature sometimes wavers and melts away, so that I can no longer be sure whether what<br />  I see with my own eyes springs from outward or inner impressions.  An experience such as this is<br />  one sure way of discovering how creative we are, and how deeply our soil participates in the<br />  perpetual creation of the world.  The same invisible divinity is at work in us as it is in Nature.  If the<br />  outside world were perchance to perish, I know that any one of us would be capable of rebuilding<br />  it.  I say these things because I believe that mountain and stream, leaf and tree, root and flower,<br />  everything that has ever been formed in Nature lies preformed within us and springs from the soul,<br />  whose essence is eternity.  Of course, this essence is beyond all our conceivable knowledge, but we<br />  can feel it nevertheless.<br />------<br />And just in passing you come across such gem like sentences and ideas as this one: \\"Quitting the place that we love means that we are condemned to inhabit our loss forever.\\"<br />I urge everyone to read and enjoy this book.  The journal entry style makes it particularly susceptible to reading in separate nightly installments.  It is a book that you can easily pick up and put down, as indeed you may wish to in order to savor the rich stew of ideas.<br />GRADE: A+whose essence is eternity.

But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as<br />  possible the main cause of the ruinous revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people,<br />  I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: \\"Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has<br />  happened.\\"<br />  -Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn<br />Over the course of his long and brilliant career as a gadfly to both Russia and the West, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn managed to pull off a remarkable trifecta: he was exiled by the USSR, banished from the Cold War dialogue by Western political and cultural elites and then banished from the discussion over Russia's future by the intelligencia there.  He has truly made a career as a voice crying in the wilderness, launching one jeremiad after another.<br />In 1945, Solzehenitsyn was sent to the Gulag for ten years after writing derogatory comments about Stalin in a letter to a friend.  One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, as the title suggests, describes what just one day would have been like behind the barbed wire.  The story is set in the forced labor camp where he was imprisoned from 1950-53.  That the system that perpetrated such crimes was evil is obvious, but it is through the sheer accumulation of mundane indignities and small triumphs (over hunger, cold, ill health, etc.) that the horror of the camps is really brought home.  One of the most dramatic moments in the book, nicely illustrative of the small scale but enormous stakes of the victories won, comes when Ivan manages to secrete a spoon that he had forgotten he was carrying.  In the end, simply surviving this barbaric system becomes the greatest victory.<br />With the publication of this book, in 1962, during the brief Kruschev thaw, Solzhenitsyn became an international sensation.  In 1974, when the first sections of The Gulag Archipelago were published in Paris, Solzhenitsyn was arrested, tried for treason and forced into exile, eventually settling in Vermont.  I suppose folks must have expected him to be so grateful for his asylum that he would express undying gratitude to the United States.  If so they underestimated the moral tenor of the man.  He proved to be nearly as outspoken a critic of the West as he had been of the USSR, culminating in his 1978 Harvard Commencement speech, where first he excoriated Western intellectuals in general (...)s is really brought home.

The specific point that he made in the book was that Hitler would not have been able to perpetrate the Holocaust without significant levels of outright assistance and implicit support from vast segments of the German population.  A more general point can, and should, be extrapolated from this : that the great tyrannies of the past hundred years have been in some disturbing sense dependent on the will of the people in those oppressive societies.  As a democrat (small 'd') and a conservative, I am particularly drawn to this view by both my faith in the power of the people and by my skepticism about the capabilities of government.  I simply find it impossible to believe that any government could long maintain itself in the face of general and spirited opposition from its citizenry.<br />The most troubling aspect of this is that it requires us to face the fact that regimes which we find horrific--the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Pol Pot's Cambodia, Red China, etc.--were, and are, essentially expressive of popular will, perhaps not of the majority, but of at least a plurality.  Here too conservative philosophy is a help, because it is based on a fairly pessimistic view of human nature.  Where the idealism of the Left assumes that Man is fundamentally good and that Man in the State of Nature is peaceful and selfless, we of the Right assume that Man is fundamentally selfish and violent.  We would not find it surprising that one segment of society would try to oppress, or even exterminate, another.<br />Now I'm not a complete pessimist : I do like to think that we (Americans) are different, and that we are sufficiently individualistic that would never tolerate totalitarianism here.  Indeed, I maintain that much of American Literature is based on the premise of individuals resisting the soul deadening forces of oppressive society and that most of our greatest literary characters have been just such rugged individualists--from Huck Finn to Cool Hand Luke to RP McMurphy.  These works, and the products of more popular culture like Red Dawn, express our belief that we (Americans) are different and reflect a hope that we would behave differently when faced with oppression.  These are not beliefs that can, nor hopefully ever will be, put to the test.  But it is notable that so much of our population is made up of those who fled oppression, and of their descendants.  Perhaps, just perhaps, we--from Baptists to Quakers to Jews, from Huguenots to Irish to Vietnamese boat people--really are the kind of people who won't tolerate such oppression.  Perhaps we have been fortunate enough to skim off the stubborn freedom loving cream of many nations.<br />At any rate, central to this understanding--that people were more or less willing participants in their own oppression--is its opposite, that those who refused to participate had alternatives.  And it is this that makes Oskar Schindler, Nelson Mandela, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Cuban Freedom Flotillas, and the like so compelling to us; all serve to reinforce our belief that it is possible to refuse to be complicit in even these most coercive of systems.  It is from this context that Slavomir Rawicz's great memoir, The Long Walk,  derives its power.<br />Rawicz was a Polish cavalry officer in WWII, serving during the futile resistance to the Nazi blitzkrieg.  As a Russian speaking resident of Pinsk, in eastern Poland, the Soviets, who had taken over this portion of the partitioned land, simply assumed Rawicz was a spy and shipped him to a prison camp in Siberia--Camp Number 303 on the Lena River.  On Easter Sunday 1941, Rawicz and six other prisoners escaped and started walking South.  They eventually traveled the length of Lake Baikal, through Mongolia, across the Gobi Desert, through Tibet, and over the Himalayas, before arriving in British-controlled India.  Despite the hardships they faced, most of which you can imagine just from their itinerary, they were continually driven forward by a simple dream of freedom.  Only four of their original number made it--a girl who joined their party along the way also died--and Rawicz (with his collaborator Ronald Downing) tells their story in a simple unaffected style, but their arduous journey speaks volumes about what individuals can achieve when they cling to that dream.  The book, like their walk, is a triumph.  Let the final word be Rawicz's own, from his 1993 Introduction to the book :<br />  I hope The Long Walk will remain as a memorial to all those who live and die for freedom, and for<br />  all those who for many reasons could not speak for themselves.  I had to tell my story as a warning<br />  to the living, and as a moral judgment for the greater good.<br />GRADE : A+-controlled India.

That's<br />  not my sole responsibility...all TV is divorced from reality.<br />  -Diahann Carroll, circa 1968<br />Taken simply as a catalogue of appearances by African Americans on television over the past sixty years, this book is perhaps adequate.  It takes an exhaustive (sometimes exhausting) look at the role of black actors on primetime television, decade by decade.  Bogle seems to have watched every episode of every TV show that ever featured blacks, from Beulah and Amos n' Andy in the early days, to the slew of UPN shows now, with stops along the way for hits like Julia,Sanford and Son, and The Cosby Show and the many all too brief series like Get Christie Love.  He discusses all of them, not just the shows in general, but individual episodes, plus TV movies and black-themed episodes of white shows.  Every snippet of TV history is held up and examined like an important fossil in the hands of a paleontologist.  But, unfortunately, the various pieces never add up to a coherent whole; the book suffers from the lack of a thesis, from an unrelenting earnestness, and from a woeful absence of perspective.<br />The overarching problem is that Bogle does not seem to be operating from a defined principle.  Is this a story about how African American images on television have evolved and gotten better, or at least more realistic, or is it about how things have really not improved ?  How should blacks be portrayed on TV ?  Have portrayals of Black America on television been better or worse than the reality of the times ?  Have those portrayals been more stereotyped and less realistic than those of whites and other ethnic groups ?  These are some of the questions that the author should have asked himself before he began writing and which the reader should expect will be answered by the end of the book.  He did not ask and they are not answered.<br />As a result, Bogle's assessments and criticisms of each show occur in an intellectual vacuum and are often contradictory.  Some shows are taken to task because they offered an unrealistic portrait of blacks as living in nuclear, middle class, nonpolitical families.  Others are criticized for falling back on societal stereotypes of single parent households, poor families, involvement in crime, etc.  If a police show has a black captain, that's unrealistic because blacks weren't put in positions of power.  If the cop is black, it's unrealistic because he's middle class and an authority figure.  If the crooks are black, that's a stereotype, placing blacks in a bad light..  Well, what the heck were the producers supposed to do ?  And doesn't the mere fact that roles were being created for black actors mean something, on some level ?<br />At times, Bogle's lack of perspective, his blind focus on African Americans, comes across as almost laughable.  In his discussion of the show The White Shadow, while complaining that the theme of a white coach having to lead troubled black youths is offensive, and worrying that the players were too often caricatures, he mentions the cast of characters and, without further comment, notes that the token white player was named Salami.  Suppose the sole black player on a white team had been nicknamed Watermelon ?  People would have been outraged, and rightly so.  Had he paused for a moment to consider this one instance of insensitivity to another ethnic group, Bogle might have stumbled upon some of the larger truths about television : it's all caricature, stereotypes, and fundamentally unrealistic situations.<br />(...)TV, with the unique pressures of its weekly schedule and the need to appeal to a mass audience, has always tended toward banality.  In the effort to supply escapist entertainment, it has relied heavily on the mindless, the unchallenging, the consciously non provocative.  Bogle stumbles upon this fundamental truth in his discussion of The Cosby Show, whosevarious problems he is seemingly constrained from criticizing because it is probably the most popular African American show of all time :<br />  The audience understood that The Cosby Show was not about contemporary politics.  Rather it was<br />  about culture.<br />You probably have to read the book to get a feel for how jarring a note this strikes after 300 pages of complaining that innumerable marginal shows were insufficiently political.  But it's important to note that Cosby, who had the #1 show on television, actually had the leeway necessary to turn his show into the kind of political platform that Bogle seems to think African American shows should have tried to be, and he did not take advantage of it.  Why then expect the many minor and largely forgotten shows that he criticizes throughout the book--shows staffed by actors, writers, directors and producers who were after all just doing their jobs and which were just looking for an audience--to have engaged in some kind of exercise in black empowerment ?<br />In the end, this book is so limited in scope that, though Bogle does a workmanlike job of describing various African American series, it's hard for the reader to figure out what his point was in writing the book in the first place.  It takes on the feel of a reference book, with encyclopedic entries, rather than a coherent narrative.

Or at least it does until someone else tells you a slightly different version of the same story two days later.  Personally, I've heard dozens of these stories over the years, many from my Mom or my friend Charlie, and I've developed a particular awareness for when folks are peddling these myths, becoming a kind of amateur clearing house.  Here are a few I've had folks tell me personally :  The Blow Dry Rabbit; The Vibrating Cactus; the Confused Driver; Batman in the Closet; The Disgruntled Bridegroom; any others, anybody?<br />I don't know that he coined the term Urban Legend, but Jan Harold Brunvand, a professor at the University of Utah, certainly popularized it with his newspaper column and a series of books in which he collects them and tries to trace their convoluted paths through the popular culture (It's amazing how often Ann Landers has a hand in promulgating them).<br />I've been a fan of Brunvand's work for years, even submitting some of my favorites to him, including one which he reprinted in The Baby Train.  His writing tends to be a little prosaic and, in letting his correspondents speak for themselves, he often presents the legends in less amusing form than he might.  But in all honesty,the real pleasure in his books lies not in the stories themselves, but in the joy of recognition, the thrill of the &quot;Gotcha!,&quot; when you finally have proof that a story is bunk.<br />This debunking process has been made much easier by the advent of the Internet; all you usually have to do is include a couple keywords from a given story and the term &quot;urban legend&quot; in a search line and you'll get numerous hits from websites that specialize in collecting and trying to stay current with them.  It's a good thing too, because this latest effort from Brunvand suffers from a major and inexplicable weakness : it has no index.  This curious omission is especially unforgivable in a reference book and is almost serious enough for me not to recommend the book.

In this interminable book, we are submitted to every tremor of inadequacy she ever felt, as she bathes in self-indulgent recollection.  But what else is there once you get past the feelings, the many, many, feelings :<br />(1) She was born rich.<br />(2) Her husband went nuts, got himself a girlfriend and tried taking the Post away.  In the midst of this struggle, he was released from an asylum, went with her to their vacation home, and was carted out in a body bag.  She got the Post.<br />(3) She and the Post were in bed, either figuratively or--she at least hints--literally, with Adlai Stevenson, JFK, and LBJ.<br />(4) As a result, they gave the personal misdeeds of Democrat presidents a wink and a nod and supported Vietnam through the 60s.  Then Nixon got elected and they published the Pentagon Papers and jumped on Watergate like a wolf on a lamb chop.<br />(5) They then skated on their new reputation for the next thirty years as the upstart Washington Times, which is owned by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon for God's sake, scooped them left an right.<br />(6) Meanwhile, and I'm particularly perplexed by why this doesn't bother more people, the Post supported Marion Barry as he drove Washington, DC into the ground, presumably because their reflexive liberalism made it impossible to criticize a black mayor.<br />(7) There is one area where Graham and the Post did depart from the doctrinaire liberal line, and that was on unions.  Of course, there was nothing noble about this; she just had to break the power of her own unionized employees in order to improve her company's bottom line.<br />Maybe I'm just being willfully obscure--heck, that's almost certainly the case--but she appears to have been an amiable party hack who had her mediocre career handed to her on a silver platter.

To that end, Sister Carrie tells the story of a pretty small town girl who uses her feminine wiles to sleep her way from the factories and saloons of Chicago to the New York stage.  Along the way, the tavern owning married man who stole to fund their escape to Chicago, kills himself after being abandoned by Carrie and ending up in Bowery flophouses.  Meanwhile, An American Tragedy tells the story, based on a sensational true crime, of a young man who is working his way towards the American dream and refuses to let a pregnant former girlfriend stand in the way of his chance for romance with a wealthy woman.  He takes the slattern out in a boat &amp; clobbers her, but is tried and executed for the crime.<br />It is an open secret that even critics who admire Dreiser, consider him to be a horrible writer technically.  American Tragedy has been called &quot;the worst-written great novel in the world&quot; and the otherwise loathsome Garrison Keillor has an amusing column about how bad he finds Sister Carrie on rereading it.  His books have all the literary grace of the phone book.<br />Thus, his reputation rests solely on the agreement of Left wing critics with his hatred of American capitalism.  Well, 100 years on, I think we can safely say that the American system has served us pretty well and the Sister Carrie's of the world are not simply insignificant but, worse for a writer, uninteresting.<br />GRADE: F	2001-11-04

J. O'Rourke is one of the very best.  Though it must be acknowledged that he's operating in a target rich environment, his stories of government stupidity, overreach, waste, and arrogance are truly funny.  He's pretty much a libertarian, though made uncomfortable by many of the social behaviors that it would allow and overly enamored of the armed forces, so he's just as likely to light out after stupid Republican ideas as he is to castigate Democrats. Parliament of Whores finds him in the perfect position to flail both, as he follows George Bush the elder to Washington in 1989, and sets out to examine the entire U. S. government.<br />Unsuspecting readers may assume that O'Rourke is just going to snidely lambaste bureaucrats, politicians, institutions, and government generally, but that assumption really underestimates him.  He's after much bigger game, as he reveals in the title of the book :<br />  Every government is a parliament of whores. The trouble is, in a democracy, the whores are us.<br />The various government employees and elected officials actually come out looking pretty good.  As portrayed by O'Rourke, they seem for the most part to be genuinely dedicated to their work and trying to do the best they can.  It is the American people who come out of this looking pretty awful.  Time and again, as he shows how useless, wasteful, and outrageously expensive the myriad government programs are, O'Rourke also makes it clear that they exist, and exist at such bloated sizes, because they have constituencies.  And those constituencies are not the easily caricatured and vilified underclass, they are more often the regular work-a-day middle classes.  You don't end up with a government as elephantine as ours unless those folks, we folks, in the broad middle have a huge appetite for government services.<br />In what I think is the best chapter in the book, \\"Protectors of a Blameless Citizenry,\\" O'Rourke tracks a terrific example of this : the demand for government investigation of sudden-acceleration incidents (SAIs).  If you recall the hysteria, this was the allegation that some vehicles, when you were just parked innocently in your garage, would suddenly lurch forward into a garage wall.  Any objective observer could have taken one look at these SAIs and figured out that they were merely episodes where people shifted into Drive without their foot on the brake, or stepped on the gas pedal instead of the brake.  But to draw such a conclusion would have meant blaming people, blaming taxpayers, blaming voters, for their own carelessness and stupidity, and that would be intolerable.  Instead, it has become the particular duty of government to absolve us of blame for such manifestations of our own ineptitude, recklessness, and stupidity.<br />P.J. O'Rourke is a national treasure, if for no other reason than this willingness to hold us all up to well deserved ridicule.  The troubling question that he raises in this book, one which Alexis de Tocqueville made in rather more measured tones in Democracy in America, is whether democracy is ultimately doomed by this very phenomenon, of the citizenry trying to avoid responsibility for their own lives.  Once the people in a democracy realize that they can simply blame others for all of the problems in their lives, even those of their own making, the democracy is morally doomed.  And worse, as Alexander Tytler said some 200 years ago, in a quote that O'Rourke cites :<br />  A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government.  It can only exist until a majority of<br />  voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse out of theterrific example of this : the demand for government investigation of sudden-acceleration incidents (SAIs).

Unless you've been living in a cave, you have surely heard some of the Sturm and Drang that attended the awarding of Elia Kazan with an honorary Oscar for career achievement.  The hysteria that this produced was a result of his decision to testify truthfully before the House Un-American Activities Committee four decades ago.  One would think that folks could be a little less passionate about the events of a half century ago, but, largely because the period is so poorly understood and the subject of so much disinformation, the wounds from the Blacklist period are still open and fresh and like stigmata, mystically appear on even those who were not born then--Ed Harris, Nick Nolte, Steven Spielberg, etc.<br />What was it that Elia Kazan, and others, did that is so abhorrent to Left-Wing Hollywood?  Simply put, he willingly testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, about the practices and membership of the Communist Party of America (CPUSA), which he had left by then.  &quot;Naming names&quot; was his great sin.  You see, many members of CPUSA were pleading the 5th Amendment rather than admit that they were Communists and rather than testify about fellow members.  It was their action that the Left elevated to the moral high ground.  It became somehow virtuous to remain a part of the criminal conspiracy to overthrow our Constitutional Democracy and to protect your traitorous cohorts.  On the other hand, those, like Kazan, who sought to expose the conspiracy, were labeled as finks, rats, snitches &amp; traitors.<br />You have to admire the beauty of what was accomplished here.  We would not see it's like again until the demonization of Linda Tripp and Ken Starr.  Only criminal conspiracies require the ethos that informing is evil.  There's no other segment of society where it's considered evil to tell the truth about wrongdoing.  But American's have a soft spot in their hearts for outlaws anyway, witness Butch &amp; Sundance and the Godfather movies.  So if you cloak your illicit enterprise in some noble trappings you can get most folks to buy into the anti-informing dogma.  Since most of the Intelligentsia was anti-anti-communist, there was fertile ground for them to plant the idea that Communists &amp; Fellow Travelers were well intentioned liberals, their opponents were close minded Neanderthals and anyone who would inform on the good Left to the evil Right, was a traitor.<br />Indulge me now in a brief thought experiment.  Let's just change one thing about our whole scenario &amp; see how much different we think reactions would be now.  Let's say that there was a sizable percentage of folks in Hollywood in the 30's who were committed Nazis.  They truly believed in their socialist principles and acted out of the best intentions.  They sought to sneak party dogma into their films, raised money for the party, tithed part of their salaries, participated in marches and petition drives &amp; what not.  Then suddenly, the Hitler/Stalin pact is announced, and many of them realize that they've been duped.  The ideology they were so devoted too, turns out to be capable of compromising with their sworn enemies.  But others are unfazed.  They stay in the party and remain devoted.  They turn on a dime and go from advocating isolation to demanding American entry into the war.  Then word starts to slip out that millions of people are being murdered by the State for their beliefs.  Murder on a scale previously unimaginable for mankind.  Many more leave the Party, their consciences finally singed.  But others stay on, still devoted to the Cause and the downfall of the U.S..  Finally, after W.W.II ends, the government begins to realize that this enormous conspiracy has been going on in it's midst.  Slowly and none too sure-footedly, the investigations begin.  An intrepid few risk the ire of their friends, coworkers and the bulk of the Intellectual class and when they are called to testify, they admit to their own participationin the conspiracy and warn that others remain involved.  They are vilified within their own milieu and when the scare dies down and those they sought to expose are accepted back into the industry, their own careers are destroyed.  But forty years later, one of their number is to be honored by the Academy.<br />Now here's where our thought experiment pays off.  Our Elia Kazan doppleganger exposed a Nazi plot to subvert the US government.  Those he informed on stayed in the Party despite the Holocaust &amp; continued to support the Nazi regime.  They refused to cooperate with government investigations and covered up for friends and for the Party.<br />Can we still see hip Hollywood walking out of the ceremony or sitting on their hands?  No, we can't imagine that can we?  Suddenly, we imagine a heroes welcome for this brave soul.  Hell, they'd be fighting for the movie rights to his story.<br />And yet, at the Academy Awards we saw Hollywood's smart set side with the Gulag and the Show Trials and the Destruction of the Kulaks and the Iron Curtain as they spurned one little man who followed the dictates of conscience and tried to warn his beloved adopted country about the serpent at its bosom.  Even an industry with as much to be ashamed of as the Movie business, must have felt a special twinge of self loathing in the dark recesses of its miserable heart after this display.<br />Oh yeah, the book.  Well, it isn't terribly well written, sorta repeats itself in some places, and in its earnest desire to expose Communist hypocrisy, it ends up seeming a little over the top in some places, too polemical.  But it does present an overwhelming picture of how extensive and malicious the Communist infiltration of Hollywood was in the 30's and 40's.

By providing each of his characters with a detailed personal history, he explores the ways that past tragedies have shaped the attitudes of those in both countries, for better and for worse.  Though they necessarily become symbols for certain attitudes and prejudices, their backgrounds make their beliefs and ideologies more understandable to the reader, who will agree with some and disagree with others, but is forced to reckon with all.  The author is then able to use the interplay between these characters, and the religious and political positions they represent, to examine the intractable issues which have proven so daunting in trying to find a way for modern Jews and Muslims to live peaceably in the lands of the old British protectorate of Palestine.<br />The differences between Palestinians and Israelis are well rehearsed these days--just pick up a newspaper and there's likely to be a story about the Middle East peace process--and while Mr. Rodgers does not slight these differences, he devotes special attention to the differences which specifically divide the Jews of Israel. (***)The author does a terrific job of presenting many complex, though-provoking issues and succeeds in playing them down the middle.  By being fair to all of the various viewpoints, and giving them sympathetic human faces, he forces us to confront them honestly, free from the inflammatory rhetoric and emotional appeals which usually accompany them.  Without sacrificing the dynamics of the thriller, he offers a refreshing opportunity to reconsider one of the last seemingly insoluble conflicts in world affairs.

Bissinger's great account of one year in the life of the Permian Panthers football team in Odessa, TX.  Odessa provided the perfect setting for him to explore a complex set of issues including race, exploitation, community pride, etc., but most of all to examine the centrality of high school sports in the life of a town.  Now we were in Texas when oil prices were booming and everyone was rolling in it, but by the time Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist, got there in 1988, the boom had gone bust and west Texas faced a genuine economic crisis, which only added to the social pressures that he addresses in the book.<br />The book focuses on a couple of key contradictions: (1) the vaulting ambition and unrealistic dreams of the athletes as opposed to the harsh reality that awaits them; (2) the relative innocence of these kids as opposed to the really cynical and exploitative manipulation of them by coaches, parents, boosters, college recruiters, etc.; and (3) the dependence of the athletic programs in such places upon black athletes, despite cultural racism which does not acknowledge their value as full human beings.  Bissinger intertwines all these threads with the very real community pride and unity that the program brings to a city that is in dire straits.  The end product is a truly great book, not only one of the only great football books ever written, but one that rises far beyond the gridiron to illuminate the problems of school boy athletics in America.<br />So this review originally ended here, but then I found a couple of delightfully ironic items while looking for links.  First, there's the article below, Author Cancels Trip After Threats in Texas, about how Bissinger was getting death threats so he had to skip Odessa on his book tour.  Way to show the world that the author's wrong and you don't take football too seriously.  Then I found an essay by a University of Minnesota student on the book.  The student's name?  Bobby Jackson.  Yes, the same Bobby Jackson from their great NCAA Final Four basketball team of several years ago.  My interest piqued, I read further.  The essay was posted by the Minnesota Pioneer Planet, as part of their series on the academic scandals that rocked that basketball program, as an example of the classroom work that Golden Gopher players turned in but which was actually done by a supposed tutor.  What can have run through the writer's mind as she wrote about the unhealthy emphasis placed on sports, to the exclusion of all other concerns in the students' lives?  Obviously, the concerns that Bissinger addressed in Friday Night Lights remain just as topical and timely ten years later.<br />GRADE: A+son.

And yet, by itself, the revelation of this satirical baroque masterpiece justifies all the wretched dreck I've waded through on the List.<br />Zuleika Dobson is the beautiful young granddaughter of the Warden of Judas College at Oxford.  She's been earning a living as a conjurer and is the toast of France and America.  But Zuleika has never loved a man.  She has determined that a woman of her superior beauty can only love a man who is so superior as to be oblivious to her charms.  Thus far, there has been no such man.<br />Immediately on her arrival on campus, the entire student body falls madly in love with her.  However, at dinner her first night the young Duke of Dorset seems indifferent.  Could he be the man?  Alas, it turns out that he too is smitten and when she discovers this she spurns him.  Unused to such a dismissal, the Duke decides that he must kill himself &amp; soon the whole College is ready to follow his example.<br />The book is a shrieking hoot from start to finish &amp; the whole thing is rendered in an ornate prose that is wholly unique.  Take this description of the Duke &amp; his troll like flat mate Noaks:<br />  Sensitive reader, start not at the apparition!  Oxford is a plexus of anomalies.<br />  These two youths were (odd as it may seem to you) subject to the same Statutes,<br />  affiliated to the same College, reading for the same School; aye! and though the<br />  one had inherited half a score of noble and castellated roofs, whose mere<br />  repairs cost him annually thousands and thousands of pounds, and the other's<br />  people had but one mean little square of lead, from which the fireworks of the<br />  Crystal Palace were clearly visible every Thursday evening, in Oxford one roof<br />  sheltered both of them.  Furthermore, there was even some measure of intimacy<br />  between them  It was the Duke's whim to condescend further in the direction of<br />  Noaks than in any other.  He saw in Noaks his own foil and antithesis, and made<br />  a point of walking up the High with him at least once in every term.  Noaks, for<br />  his part, regarded the Duke with feelings mingled of idolatry and disapproval.<br />  The Duke's First in Mods oppressed him (who, by dint of dogged industry, had<br />  scraped a Second) more than all the other differences between them.  But the<br />  dullard's envy of brilliant men is always assuaged by the suspicion that they<br />  will come to a bad end.  Noaks may have regarded the Duke as a rather pathetic<br />  figure, on the whole.<br />Or this passage describing the suicidal yearnings of the student body:<br />  You cannot make a man by standing a sheep on its hindlegs.  But by standing a<br />  flock of sheep in that position you can make a crowd of men.  If man were not a<br />  gregarious animal, the world might have achieved, by this time, some real<br />  progress towards civilization.  Segregate him, and he is no fool. But let him<br />  loose among his fellows, and he is lost--he becomes just a unit in unreason.  If<br />  any one of the undergraduates had met Miss Dobson in the desert of Sahara, he<br />  would have fallen in love with her; but not one in a thousand of them would have<br />  wished to die because she did not love him.  The Duke's was a peculiar case.<br />  For him to fall in love was itself a violent peripety, bound to produce a<br />  violent upheaval; and such was his pride that for his love to be unrequited<br />  would naturally enamour him of death.  these other, these quite ordinary, young<br />  men were the victims less of Zuleika than of the Duke's example, and of one<br />  another.  A crowd, proportionately to its size, magnifies all that in its units<br />  pertains to the emotions, and diminishes all that in them pertains to thought.<br />  It was because these undergraduates were a crowd that their passion for Zuleika<br />  was so intense; and it was because they were a crowd that they followed so<br />  blindly the lead given to them.  To die for Miss Dobson was 'the thing to do'.<br />  The Duke was going to do it.  The Junta was going to do it.  It is a hateful<br />  fact, but we must face the fact, that snobbishness was one of the springs to the<br />  tragedy here chronicled.<br /><br />I can't recommend this one highly enough.lf a violent peripety, bound to produce a <BR>                        violent upheaval; and such was his pride that for his love to be unrequited <BR>                        would naturally enamour him of death.  these other, these quite ordinary, young <BR>                        men were the victims less of Zuleika than of the Duke's example, and of one <BR>                        another.

But the sense of dread that informs his work is metaphysical rather<br />  than religious in nature : at its base are vertiginous glimpses of the collapse of all structures of<br />  understanding including language itself, flashing intimations that the very self that speaks has no<br />  real existence.<br />  -J. M. Coetzee, Borge's Dark Mirror (NY Review of Books)<br />A modern author who spends his life writing two chapters of Don Quijote, not rewriting mind you, but writing the original, a wizard who dreams a son into existence only to realize that he himself is but the emanation of another's dream, an infinite library, a man accepting a challenge to a knife fight which he can not possibly win, these are just some of the elements that Jorge Luis Borges draws upon in his stories.  These labyrinthine fictions loop back upon themselves and upon reality in order first to undermine the claims of reason and ultimately to call into question existence itself.<br />Borges was one of the great conservative authors of the 20th Century--his support for things like the Bay of Pigs invasion and his anti-Peronism are widely considered to have cost him the oh-so-politically-correct Nobel Prize--but his was a very particular conservatism, the conservatism of anti-Reason, of which the other great exemplar was Leo Tolstoy.  On first reading War and Peace, I couldn't understand how a supposedly great writer had made such an incomprehensible hash of the battle scenes, but in his great essay, The Fox and the Hedgehog, Isaiah Berlin makes the compelling case that Tolstoy was thereby attempting to show just how unsusceptible events are to the application of human reason.  Borges similarly challenges the central place of reason in the modern age, suggesting that existence is simply  incomprehensible, absurd, unyielding to human understanding or planning.  With this understanding of how subjective our interpretation of life is at the forefront of his work, Borges then proceeds to craft brief, tightly controlled, imaginative, stories which seem to play with the idea that the writer is the god of the literary world that he creates.<br />Of course, this too is a paradox.  Like the Existentialists, he is hoist on the petard of his own ideology.  If intellectual exercises are pointless, and his writings are nothing if not intellectual exercises, why devote his life to a pointless exercise?  Likewise, one wonders why anyone would produce such carefully constructed stories if all of existence is so essentially dubious.  The awkward answer can be nothing but faith.  God may be a distant figure to Borges, a non-existent one to the Existentialists, but the very act of continuing to write beautiful stories to argue their point of view, indicates that at some level they do find a purpose to life and do trust in the capacity of their own voices to influence other people and the future.  Borges shares a fascination with suicide or at least the acceptance of death with the Existentialists, but like them, he kept on going.  Their actions speak louder than their words.<br />Perhaps because of this central paradox in his work, I found it a little difficult to read the whole set of  stories straight through.  I got a sense that the author didst protest too much.  If everything is mere illusion, why'd he bother to write all of this &amp; why am I reading it?  On the other hand, if you read them one at a time and let each roll around in your head, you really get a chance to savor their playfulness and ingenuity and to ponder the questions they raise.  I certainly recommend them, but suggest that they are best when read over a longer period of time.

I certainly recommend them, but suggest that they are best when read over a longer period of time. Don't get stuck on an airplane with just this book. <br />GRADE :B	2001-11-04

After an opening scene where Woolf commits suicide by walking into a river with a rock in her pocket, Cunningham intertwines three storylines : a day in the life of Virginia Woolf as she is at work on Mrs. Dalloway; a day in the life of Laura Brown, a pregnant suburban Los Angeles mother with a three year old son, a war hero husband, and a desperate longing to escape her suffocating life; and a day in the life of Clarissa Vaughn, a middle aged lesbian book editor in Greenwich Village who is planning a party for her friend and former lover Richard, who is dying of AIDs but has just won a prestigious poetry prize.  Both Clarissa and his Mother are central characters in Richard's poetry and his novel.<br />Beyond the fact that they are all gay and suicidal, these are simply not characters who think and behave like the rest of us.  At one point Clarissa, who was nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway years before by Richard, meets her friend Walter, a despised author of gay romance novels, who dresses too youthfully for people's taste, and adorns himself with beautiful young men :<br />  'Nice to see you,' Walter says.  Clarissa knows--she can practically see--that Walter is, at this<br />  moment, working mentally through a series of intricate calibrations regarding her personal<br />  significance.  Yes, she's the woman in the book, the subject of a much-anticipated novel by an<br />  almost legendary writer, but the book failed, didn't it?  It was curtly reviewed; it slipped silently<br />  beneath the waves.  She is, walter decides, like a deposed aristocrat, interesting without being<br />  particularly important.  She sees him arrive at his decision.  She smiles.<br />Now we do all know the Walters of the world, the coworker whose attention wanders if a boss walks by and you can see him thinking, \\"Hey, there's someone more important I could be talking to.\\"  But do you befriend these people and invite them to parties?  Of course not, they are too transparently phony.  The problem in this book however is that everyone is phony; they are all playing roles; after all, homosexuality itself is ultimately little more than a pose.  Virginia Woolf has only a tenuous grip on sanity; Laura Brown shares a brief moment of passion with another woman and longs to escape her marriage; Richard plays at being the great poet, though he and Clarissa are conscious of the fact that much of his reputation rests on his homosexuality and his disease; Clarissa, despite decades of a loving relationship with another woman, loves Richard, who, despite his decades of homosexuality, loves her.  This is a world of artificiality.  People do and say things for effect, like reading and praising Virginia Woolf, and not because the actually believe in what they say or do.  Clarissa has never had a Quarter Pounder--it simply isn't done--who do you know whose identity is held hostage to the idea that you can't eat at McDonalds?  More importantly, who do know, and like, that looks down on eating at McDonalds.<br />If you plan on reading the book, please read no farther, the following will betray some of the key \\"surprises\\" of the plot.  several reviewers referred to the surprising ways in which Cunningham ties the three plots together at the end of the book, but they can be surprising only to someone who is not paying attention.  Richard naturally turns out to be the Virginia Woolf doppelganger and upon his suicide, the funeral is attended by his mother, Laura Brown.  (An aside : one of the central activities that is used to show the emptiness of Laura's life back in the 40s is her rather sketchy attempt to bake a cake for her husband's birthday.  This, combined with her unhappy mewlings, was so reminiscent of the horrid song MacArthur Park--\\"someone left a cake out in the rain and I don't thing that I can take it,cause it took so long to bake it...\\"--that I found it hard to take her seriously.) The title, The Hours (which was also the original title of Mrs. Dalloway), and the essential outlook of the book are explained when Clarissa finds Richard perched on a windowsill in his apartment, about to leap to his death :<br />  He says, 'I don't know if I can face this.  You know.  The party and the ceremony, and then the<br />  hour after that, and the hour after that.'<br />  'You don't have to go the party.  You don't have to go to the ceremony.  You don't have to do<br />  anything at all.'<br />  'But there are still the hours, aren't there?  One and then another, and you get through that one<br />  and then, my god, there's another.'<br />Without sounding to harsh, let me just state my opinion that if you really think life is so awful that it just consists of a struggle to get through the hours of the day, you probably should commit suicide; it's hard to see how you are any great loss to the rest of us.<br />GRADE : Fan take it, cause it took so long to bake it...\\"--that I found it hard to take her seriously.)

One result of this political bias is that, for the most part, sports coverage tends to be fairly conservative too.  Sure, sports writers and fans may moan about player salaries and big market teams, giving themselves a faint patina of egalitarianism, but as a general rule, don't begrudge them the money much, and, for all the lip service given to competitive balance, are never happier than when great teams come along.  Take Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls for example; you never heard a peep about the gazillion dollars that Michael made or about the fact that no one else had any shot at the title.  Those years, during which the NBA hit its all time peak in popularity, will be remembered for the dominance of not merely one team, but one player.<br />Likewise, in those years where the NFL is truly competitive and small market teams have a shot at the Super Bowl, no one watches the games.  The Rams vs. the Titans may have been a nice story, but no one followed it.  Meanwhile, on most other issues, fans and journalists are positively reactionary.  The trend towards old style ballparks, classic uniforms, and more traditional rules are all manifestations of a core belief that most sports were better forty years ago than they are today.<br />So it is a rather extraordinary thing when an author pens a sports book that can truly be described as politically radical.  The Yankees are to Dean Chadwin as the Soviet Union was to Ronald Reagan--the focus of evil in the modern world.  This book is a frequently funny, always splenetic, only sometimes ridiculous, tirade aimed at the racism, homophobia, exploitativeness, acquisitiveness, ignorance, intolerance, duplicity, and greed of George Steinbrenner, the fans, the athletes, baseball in general, and Rudy Guliani, and the other politicians who are so eager to spend public money to keep or lure professional franchises.<br />Personally, I grew up in Northern New Jersey, where there were only two kinds of people.  Those who rooted for the Yankees/Giants/Rangers/Knicks were the worst kind of front running filth, the kind of people who would have remained Loyalist during the American Revolution, or, were they French (and they nearly were) would have been Vichy rather than Resistance.  These people expected victory as something of a birthright, and weren't particular about how it was secured.  The rest of us, though we liked to see our teams win periodically (the Mets in '69, '73, '86 seemed to have an adequate pace), actually did not peg our loyalties to championships--we stuck by our squads even at their most hopeless (and perhaps only a lifelong Nets fan can truly even comprehend the meaning of the word &quot;hopeless.&quot;).  Now I live in New England, root (as one must) for the Red Sox (though still a Met fan too) and have drunk deep at the well of Yankee hatred.  So I thoroughly enjoyed the sheer venom that Chadwin spews in this book.  It goes over the edge in certain places and some of his political beliefs are simply too absurd to be taken seriously, but he's right on the money about what a boondoggle all of this publicly funded stadium construction is, and the book is generally such a drastic change of pace from the glut of onanistic Yankee hagiographies we've been inundated with over the years that he deserves credit just for swimming against the hegemonic pinstriped tide.<br />It is necessary to loathe the Yankees.  And while it is not necessary to read this book in order to summon the appropriate loathing, it certainly helps.  The next time some Billy Crystal/Bob Costas type wells up when talking about how the best day of his childhood was that day at the Stadium when Mickey hit two, grab this book and turn to pretty much any page, it will surely help quell the nausea.<br />GRADE : Cally, I grew up in Northern New Jersey, where there were only two kinds of people.

Within this slender tome she reveals the remarkable story of the 18th Century clock maker William Harrison and his dogged determination to create a clock that would accurately tell time in two far removed places.  If this could be done it would enable sailors to determine longitude and vastly improve the safety of the British fleet.<br />On October 22, 1707, Admiral Sir Clowdisley Shovel sailed his fleet, returning from a successful engagement with the French, into 'dirty weather'.  When a sailor reported that his private calculations indicated that the ships were badly out of position, Shovel had him hung because such private navigation was highly illegal, the ships proceeded to wreck themselves upon the reefs of the Scilly Isles and 2000 men were lost.  Largely as a result of this disaster, the British Parliament, under Queen Anne, passed the British Longitude Act of 1714, with a prize of 20,000 english pounds (roughly $12 million today) for anyone that could provide longitude to an accuracy of 1/2 degree.  As Sobel explains, latitude is fixed by the physical world and relatively easy to determine, but longitude is based on a political calculation, where to place the starting point, and requires that you be able to tell the time where you are and also at that starting point.  The problem of keeping accurate time on board ship was so daunting that as august a personage as Isaac Newton did not think the problem was solvable.<br />Sobel's thrilling story of how a simple English &quot;mechanic&quot; overcame the many physical challenges and the equally forbidding political problems (the members of the Longitude board frowned upon mere clock makers and expected an astronomer to win the prize) to finally win the prize after 40 years of effort, makes for fascinating reading.  It is a book which will remind you of the importance of the individual in history.<br />GRADE: A-	2001-11-04

For most of the book (and movie) the story seems like a pretty straightforward riff on Mr. Roberts (read Orrin's review): in this case, of course, it's Captain Queeg (even the name seems intended to invoke memories of Moby Dick) who is mentally unbalanced and, unlike Captain Morton in  Mr. Roberts, his seeming derangement is genuinely dangerous because the boat he commands is a mine sweeper rather than a transport ship.  Wouk carefully lays the groundwork so that we understand and sympathize with the crew's eventual mutiny.  Then, presto-chango, he whips the rug from beneath our feet:<br />  \\"Course I'm warped,\\" said Greenwald, \\"and I'm drunk, but it suddenly seems to me that if I wrote a<br />  war novel I'd try to make a hero out of Old Yellowstain.\\" Jorgensen whooped loudly, but nobody<br />  else laughed, and the ensign subsided, goggling around. \\"No, I'm serious, I would. Tell you why,<br />  Tell you how I'm warped. I'm a Jew, guess most of you know that. Name's Greenwald, kind of look<br />  like one, and I sure am one, from way back. Jack Challee said I used smart Jew-lawyer<br />  tactics--course he took it back, apologized, after I told him a few things he didn't know-- Well,<br />  anyway...The reason I'd make Old Yellowstain a hero is on account of my mother, little<br />  gray-headed Jewish lady, fat, looks a lot like Mrs. Maryk here, meaning no offense.\\"<br />  He actually said \\"offensh.\\" His speech was halting and blurry. He was gripping the spilling glass<br />  tightly The scars On his hand made red rims around the bluish grafted skin.<br />  \\"Well, sure, you guys all have mothers, but they wouldn't be in the same bad shape mine would if<br />  we'd of lost this war, which of course we aren't, we've won the damn thing by now.

I had an uncle and an aunt in<br />  Cracow, who are soap now, but that's different, I never saw my uncle and aunt, just saw letters in<br />  Jewish from them, ever since I was a kid, but I can't read Jewish. but never could read them. Jew,<br />  but I can't read Jewish.\\"<br />  The faces looking up at him were becoming sober and puzzled. \\"I'm coming to Old Yellowstain.<br />  Coming to him. See, while I was studying law 'n old Keefer here was writing his play for the<br />  Theatre Guild, and Willie here was on the playing fields of Prinshton, all that time these birds we<br />  call regulars--these stuffy, stupid Prussians, in the Navy and the Army -were manning guns.

The concept of this fighting force made up of desperate men of all nations, given a new lease on life because they did not have to give their real name or background when they signed up, lent itself easily to fiction and to childhood fantasy.  I don't remember all of the Foreign Legion movies we watched but Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion (1950) and March or Die (1977) [bad movie, great tagline: &quot;In the French Foreign Legion, you march or you die!&quot;] spring to mind, and of course the greatest of them all was Beau Geste (1939).  Directed by William Wellman and starring Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy and Susan Hayward, it was one of those movies you had to watch every time it was on.  Happily, the original novel is nearly its equal.<br />The three Geste brothers, orphaned early in life, are raised by an Aunt.  Their raucous youths are filled with the literature of adventure and ritualized horseplay centered around these myths and legends.  So when the family's prized Blue Water sapphire turns up missing, each of the young men confesses to being the thief in order to protect the others and one by one they head off to join the French Foreign Legion.  As luck would have it, they meet up in the deserts of Africa where they fall under the command of the malevolent Sergeant Lejaune.  Not content to merely be a martinet, Lejaune sets his sights on stealing the jewel, which rumor holds to be in their possession.  Meanwhile, the unruly troops he commands are planning a mutiny and the marauding Tauregs pin this badly outnumbered and bitterly divided unit of Legionnaires at Fort Zinderneuf.  The ensuing drama plays itself out as the French forces battle overwhelming odds.  Ultimately, only a handful of men survive to discover the truth behind the Blue Water's disappearance.<br />It just doesn't get any better than that central story.  Wren combines  a classic mystery and a desert adventure.  The Gestes are living embodiments of the tales on which they were weaned--generous, noble, brave and loyal.  My only real complaint is with the framing device which surrounds the story.  The novel opens with a major who lead the relief column sent to Zinderneuf describing what he found there and concludes with an overlong d&eacute;nouement getting the story back to England and the jewel mystery.  But these are minor quibbles when set against the truly thrilling story at the heart of the novel.

A weird, totally original blend of fantasy, gothic, and allegory, with characters out of Dickens by way of Hieronymous Bosch, and looming over it all the mammoth, decaying architecture of Gormenghast, the Groan family castle.  The first two books in the series concern the newly born heir, Titus, 77th Earl of Groan, born into an aristocratic family which is completely bound by ancient and inane rules and ceremonies, and the efforts of one rebellious kitchen hand, Steerpike, who is determined to bring the whole artificial edifice, physical and cultural, crumbling to the ground.  In the third volume, Titus leaves Gormenghast to seek his fortune in the outside world, a less claustrophobic, but still quite strange and intimidating landscape.<br />Mervyn Peake was raised in China, where his father was a medical missionary.  Coincidentally or not, he was born there in the year (and month) that the child emperor (recall Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Emperor) was overthrown.  One can only imagine how bizarre a childhood he must have had, a Christian English boy growing up amidst the poverty of revolutionary China.  He returned to England for college, where he studied art and adopted something of a bohemian persona.  He joined an artists colony on the Island of Sark, the setting for his novel Mr. Pye.  As he began to develop a reputation as an artist, Peake left Sark, in 1935, to become a teacher at Westminster School of Art, where he met his wife, Maeve.  World War II broke out just as he began to come into his own, and though he volunteered with the understanding he could be a war artist, he was instead placed in a series of inappropriate jobs until he had a nervous breakdown.  He did make it to Germany at the end of the War, arriving at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in time to do sketches of the wraith like survivors and to have the horrors of the place seared into his soul.<br />He'd begun writing Titus Groan while he was in the army and it was published in 1946.  Gormenghast followed in 1950 and both were critically acclaimed.  He'd always had an aura of doom about him and was obviously not all that mentally sturdy, but the lingering psychological effects of what he saw in Germany (he returned after the War while the country was still devastated) and a combination of illnesses, including Parkinson's, made his later years quite awful.  Titus Alone, the final volume of the trilogy, was published in 1959, his last major work, though he would linger for another ten years.<br />The allegory of Gormenghast is fairly straightforward, and seems to parallel what Peake had himself witnessed.  A once great society rots from within, beset by bureaucracy and senseless ceremony.  A servant from the lowest ranks of the society rises up to challenge the established order, but turns out to be more evil than the existing regime.  I note--though I doubt it's significant, since I saw it mentioned nowhere else--that you can transpose a few vowels to make the title read &quot;German Ghost.&quot;  At any rate, it is the case that Peake was in China as it's Empire crumbled, returned to Britain in time to watch it sink after the War, and saw the horrifying aftermath of Nazi Germany's Steerpikean nightmare.  In a sense then, Gormenghast tells the story of the Century, of the fall of the upper classes of the old order and their replacement by the even more horrid workers.  Though Titus manages to stop Steerpike, he nonetheless abandons Gormenghast to seek a brighter future.<br />The greatness of Peake's work though does not lie in the story, it instead rests on his accomplishment as a visual storyteller.  This is the most painterly form of literature imaginable.  It helps that he did illustrations for the books himself, but even without his drawings, the books seem to move from set tableau to set tableau, more like a series of paintings than like a fluid narrative.  This great strength of his work is also a significant weakness, because the tale is so two dimensional.  With Tolkein, there's such depth to the story--not surprising considering that he created mythology, languages, history, etc. for each of the peoples in the trilogy--that the reader is always conscious of the sense that the teller of the tale could veer off onto any tangent for hundreds of pages without faltering.  Gormenghast has more of the feel of a movie set; particular images are brilliantly imagined and realized, but there's nothing behind the image.  You never really feel that Peake has given a moment's thought to either the 75th or the 78th Earl of Groan.<br />This weakness becomes glaring in the third book of the trilogy, Titus Alone, as Peake sends his young hero out on a quest, the purpose of which is unfathomable.  Though it does afford the author to end his tale with a nuclear-like holocaust and the admonition that Gormenghast's greatness persists in Titus Groan's mind, should he have the courage to recreate it.  Some fans may find the suggestion to be blasphemous, but I think most readers will be well served by just reading the first two books.  In fact, in the BBC's fine television production last year, they left out the third volume.  Peake's writing is so original and so marvelous that you owe it to yourself to experience it, but the tale is not so compelling that you need pursue it to its very end.<br />GRADE : B+strength of his work is also a significant weakness, because the tale is so two dimensional.

Oh sure, Joe Lieberman famously expressed some mild disappointment over the whole Monica mess, but it was really just the sort of solemn head wagging speech your Dad used to give you as an alternative to a spanking, and then Joe of course voted in lock step with the rest of his Party to exonerate the big lug.  Not a single member of Bill Clinton's Cabinet or staff ever resigned to protest his behavior; not a single member of his Party ever called on him to resign or even suggested that his offenses should be punished.  At the end of the Impeachment process, Bill Clinton was left standing tall and the people who sought to hold him to account--Ken Starr, Linda Tripp, Kathleen Willey, the House managers, etc.--were widely portrayed in the press as a collection of obsessive weirdos.  You can almost excuse the guy for feeling like he was bulletproof.<br />So then what happens ?  He's out of office for one month and what's everybody upset about ? What is the offense that finally gets even his wife and his former employees upset ?  What could possibly be so awful that even lap dog columnists like Al Hunt, Eleanor Clift, Richard Cohen and Jake Tapper are offended ?  What indiscretion is so monumental that it actually leads James Carville to stop defending him ?  The straw that broke the camel's back turns out to be a little bit of simony.  That's right; after all that's gone before, the piffling little matter of trading pardons for sexual favors and cash turns out to be the one thing that the Left can not tolerate.  To an impartial observer, this just doesn't seem fair.  It is far too late for Democrats to try to redeem themselves by finally holding Bill Clinton responsible for something; they lay down with this dog for a decade; it's no use expressing shock that they've woken up with fleas.  Bill Clinton is the victim of the worst kind of hypocrisy.  All those truly horrible things he did were just fine with the Party, as long as he was President.  Now he leaves office and his own cohorts are going to nail him for selling pardons, a victimless crime if ever there was one ?  Where do they get off ?<br />This is the very situation that Bill Bennett tried to warn them, and the rest of us, about when he wrote this little book at the height of the Monica scandal :<br />  [O]n Bill Clinton's behalf, in his defense, many bad ideas are being put into widespread circulation.<br />  It is said that private character has virtually no impact on governing character; that what matters<br />  above all is a healthy economy; that moral authority is defined solely by how well a president deals<br />  with public policy matters; that America needs to become more European (read: more<br />  &quot;sophisticated&quot;) in its attitude toward sex; that lies about sex, even under oath, don't really matter;<br />  that we shouldn't be &quot;judgmental&quot;; that it is inappropriate to make preliminary judgments about the<br />  president's conduct because he hasn't been found guilty in a court of law; and so forth.<br />  If these arguments take root in American soil -- if they become the coin of the public realm -- we<br />  will have validated them, and we will come to rue the day we did. These arguments define us down;<br />  they assume a lower common denominator of behavior and leadership than we Americans ought to<br />  accept. And if we do accept it, we will have committed an unthinking act of moral and intellectual<br />  disarmament. In the realm of American ideals and the great tradition of public debate, the high<br />  ground will have been lost. And when we need to rely again on this high ground -- as surely we<br />  will need to -- we will find it drained of its compelling moral power. In that sense, then, the<br />  arguments invoked by Bill Clinton and his defenders represent an assault on American ideals, even<br />  if you assume the president did nothing improper. So the arguments need to be challenged.<br />  I believe these arguments are also a threat to our understanding of American self-government. It<br />  demands active participation in, and finally, reasoned judgments on, important civic matters.<br />  &quot;Judgment&quot; is a word that is out of favor these days, but it remains a cornerstone of democratic<br />  self-government. It is what enables us to hold ourselves, and our leaders, to high standards. It is<br />  how we distinguish between right and wrong, noble and base, honor and dishonor. We cannot<br />  ignore that responsibility, or foist it on others. It is the price -- sometimes the exacting price -- of<br />  citizenship in a democracy. The most popular arguments made by the president's supporters invite<br />  us to abandon that participation, those standards, and the practice of making those distinctions.<br />This is precisely what has happened.  Having refused to judge Bill Clinton for nine years, having refused others the right to judge him, Democrats and their fellow travelers no longer have any moral standing on which to rely when they seek to judge him now.<br />Bennett systematically annihilates every defense of the President for those earlier offenses and brick by brick builds the case for why a healthy society must not tolerate, and why it is destructive to the culture to excuse, such behavior.  His warning, which unfortunately went unheeded, is now coming back to haunt those who have excused so much on Bill Clinton's part that their current protestations inevitably ring hollow.<br />It is late February, 2001, as I write this.  Despite a few outright condemnations by former officials like Jimmy Carter and Hamilton Jordan and some general noises of disgust from the rank and file, no major elected Democrat has yet come forth to indict Bill Clinton and his behavior.  But I will predict that, within the next couple of weeks, both Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, and probably John Kerry and Bob Kerrey, will give major speeches in which they cut Bill loose and say that finally he has gone too far.  When that time comes, it will be helpful to recall that following Clinton's impeachment by the House, Al Gore referred to him as &quot;one of our greatest Presidents,&quot; and that Lieberman, Kerrey, and Kerry all voted to acquit.  Given the opportunity to root this cancer out of the Presidency and remove him from the body politic, they all took a pass.  It is useless for them to decry that fact that the tumor metastasized.

(Can anyone else think of any?)  Moreover, his lean tough prose established him as one of the most important stylists of his generation--a reputation he subsequently embellished with works like Solo Faces.<br /><br />The novel tells the story of Captain Cleve Connell and his 100 missions in Korea.  His goal, like that of nearly every other pilot, is to shoot down the 5 MIG's that will qualify him as an ace: In this war, he was more certain than ever, he would attain himself, as men do who venture past all that is known. This is the strange attraction of war, the opportunity it affords for men to test themselves at a pressure point that lies beyond anything they experience otherwise.  But as Cleve flies mission after mission, he seldom even meets the enemy and, more galling, he sees unworthy men become heroes when they put personal glory ahead of the safety of their fellow pilots.  Then in one brilliant moment, both his physical and moral courage are tested.<br />This is a terrific novel.  Thank goodness it was finally reissued.<br />GRADE: A	2001-11-04

Miss Bock's class.  Former nun.  Pretty strict but very nice.  One day when it was a little loud as we changed classes in our inner city school, she yelled at us; &quot;At East orange high School they may all be shooting heroin in the bathroom but at least it's quite in the hallways!&quot;  Our assignment--read a book and build a diorama.  You remember dioramas don't you?  You take a shoe box, some construction paper &amp; some glue and you build a little scene inside of the box.  Let's put it this way, I'm firmly convinced that my wife only wanted to have kids so that she could one day build dioramas with them.<br />I, on the other hand, had no interest then, nor any now, in such projects.  Racing through my fevered eleven year old's brain went various schemes and dodges to get out from under this burden.  Sadly I did not have the kind of parents who were embarrassed by having me turn in woefully inadequate projects.  Remember when your Cub Scout troop did Pinewood Derby and there were always those kids whose Dads had clearly built their car?  In our troop we actually had two kids whose dads were Shop Teachers.  The Derby cars they brought in could have been sold in stores.  Meanwhile, my Father told me it would be a good learning experience if I built my own.  The predictable result was that I produced this misshapen, day-glo green, bricklike car with the wheels accidentally glued into immobility.  Suffice it to say, I was no challenge to the shop brats, but I did learn something:  cheaters win.  Absent any illicit parental assistance and devoid of the requisite personal motivation, I needed a really easy book and an extremely basic diorama scene.  Thank you Richard Bach!<br />I read mega-bestselling Jonathan Livingston Seagull--all of 127 pages with copious numbers of photographs.  Then I took some blue construction paper and glued it into the bottom of the box, cut out the picture of a seagull from the cover of the book and glued it onto the blue background.  Voila!  Five minutes, project done.  As you might intuit, Miss Bock was significantly less impressed by my ingenuity than I was.  As I recall she took inordinate and sadistic pleasure in comparing my box to Mark Caldwell's Call of the Wild action scene, which included trees, snow, a moving dog and a little view portal like a binocular lens through which you viewed the scene.<br />Returning to this book now, I feel compelled to defend my vision.  The story of the book is almost ridiculously simple.  A young seagull wants to learn to fly better.  The elders of his flock inform him in no uncertain terms that a seagull only needs to fly well enough to feed himself, that flying is not the point of being a seagull.  But Jonathan rebels against the proscribed ambitions of the other gulls; he yearns to explore the boundaries of flight.  As he continues to test these limits, the Flock expels him, but eventually a group of younger gulls join him in his quest and together they transcend their seagullness.  The message of the book is perhaps best expressed in the epigraph above and in a conversation between Jonathan and Elder Chiang:<br />  &quot;Chiang, this world isn't heaven at all, is it?&quot;<br />  The Elder smiled in the moonlight.  &quot;You are learning again, Jonathan Seagull,&quot; he said.<br />  &quot;Well what happens from here?  Where are we going?  Is there no such place as heaven?&quot;<br />  &quot;No, Jonathan, there is no such place.  Heaven is not a place, and it is not a time.  Heaven is being<br />  perfect.<br />This dual message about freedom and the pursuit of perfection is simple but classic.  In his own way, Jonathan fits easily within the mainstream of American Literature with heroes like Huck Finn (see Orrin's review), RP McMurphy (see Orrin's review), Cool Hand Luke and the rest.  His quest to escape the limits accepted by the Flock isthe quintessential quest of Western Man.  And what image expresses Bach's allegorical notion better than a solitary seagull soaring?  In retrospect, I think I deserved an A.<br />This book is not particularly profound.  It is sufficiently ambiguous that different readers will focus on different aspects of the story and take away different messages.  But there is something undeniably compelling about Bach's fundamental faith in the individual.  It is an especially appropriate book for teens and even adolescents, but adults looking to kill an hour will enjoy it too.  Heck, if you and your kid read it, you can build a diorama together afterwards.<br />GRADE: Bccepted by the Flock is the quintessential quest of Western Man.

She handles the facts of the story masterfully, rendering the potentially confusing bureaucratic history of the project in a narrative which is relatively easy to follow.  But she makes the ideology and politics which surround the story unnecessarily bewildering.  Here's a possibility that she seems never to have considered: Ronald Reagan and the supporters of SDI simply want to have a way to stop incoming nuclear missiles from detonating on American soil. <br />It doesn't seem like this should be such a hard concept to grasp.  Other countries have nuclear missiles, countries which hate America, and they point these missiles at us.  It just shouldn't be that hard to build a technology which will track incoming missiles and shoot them down.  Now, there are some legitimate objections to this viewpoint, let's look at a few and the responses: <br />    Objection: Actually, it's very hard to build. <br />    Response: We may as well try, it's not impossible is it? <br />    Objection: Actually, it is impossible. <br />    Response: You mean there is some scientific reason why one can't track and shoot down incoming missiles? <br />    Objection: No, but the enemy could overwhelm it by launching thousands of missiles. <br />    Response: So we'd be no worse off than we were without the system and it's possible that we could save millions of lives if a rogue state or rebellious general launched one or two, right? <br />    Objection: But it's hugely expensive, we've spent $60 Billion on it since Reagan's original SDI speech. <br />    Response: And according to WhiteHouse budget projections, the U.S. will spend about $1.8 Trillion overall next year, so even if we spent that entire $60 Billion in the next year, that would only be about 3% of the total budget. <br />    Objection: Did you hear me?  I said $60 Billion; doesn't that number mean anything to you? <br />    Response: Oddly enough, it just happens to be almost exactly the amount of Bill Gates's current net worth today (Based on Microsoft's current stock price, Bill is worth: $59.2 Billion--7/06/00).  Billions just aren't what they used to be.  This is basically a security system that one, admittedly unusual, U.S. citizen could fund out of his own pocket. <br />    Objection: Okay, but it would be really destabilizing to have this system. <br />    Response: Why would it be destabilizing for us to be able to stop a nuclear missile. <br />    Objection:  Because then China and Russia would have to build many more missiles to guarantee that their attack would succeed. <br />    Response:  Why do they still have missiles pointed at us? <br />    Objection:  They hate us. <br />    Response:  Well, if there are these countries out there that hate us enough to devote their national resources to trying to make sure they can kill us, shouldn't we try to defend ourselves? <br />    Objection:  No, no, no!  The key to security is to leave ourselves so vulnerable that they know they can destroy us. <br />    Response:  You lost me there. <br />    Objection:  That's the beauty of the whole system.  As long as they know they can blow us up, they won't build a lot of missiles. <br />    Response:  Aren't China and Korea and Iraq and those countries developing nuclear weapons programs just as fast as they can?  Didn't the Chinese actually corrupt our last Presidential election in order to get access to our nuclear secrets? <br />    Objection:  Well, even if that's true and even if you could build SDI, it would violate the ABM Treaty. <br />    Response:  What ABM Treaty? <br />Objection:  The one we signed with the Soviet Union. <br />    Response;  What Soviet Union? <br />    Objection:  You remember them, they're Russia now. <br />    Response:  Oh yeah, wasn't the Soviet Union the country that tried competing with us in the Cold War, but then found that they couldn't match our technological advances, like SDI, and ended up bankrupting themselves? <br />    Objection:  Yeah, them <br />    Response:  Well, the program seems to be working just fine so far. <br />To give Ms FitzGerald her due, the objector there yielded some points that she would not have, and that makes the book even more confusing.  For example, she maintains that President Reagan was sort of just a national salesman, albeit a great one.  The title of the book, in fact, comes from a Willy Loman speech in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. <br />    Nobody dast blame this man.  You don't understand : Willy was a salesman.  And for a salesman <BR>    there is no rock bottom to the life.  He don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you the law or give <BR>    you medicine.  He's the man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine.  And <BR>    when they start not smiling back--that's an earthquake.  And then you get yourself a couple of spots <BR>    on your hat, and then you're finished.  Nobody dast blame this man.  A salesman is got to dream, <BR>    boy.  It comes with the territory. <br />So her theory, or one of them, is that Reagan never really believed much in SDI and just proposed it out of desperation when he was doing poorly in the polls.  However, he sold himself and the country so well on the concept, that it refuses to die.  Of course, Reaganauts can't reveal all this, so the program requires an official mythology so there's this official version of the genesis of the idea for missile defense which involves Reagan having an epiphany during a 1979 visit to a NORAD base, when he realizes, reputedly for the first time, that we have no defenses against missile attack.  He is so troubled by this realization, that we lie naked before a nuclear aggressor, that he envisions a space shield. <br />The author gleefully goes about poking holes in this mythic tale (a tale which to the best of my knowledge she is the only one who believes is central to the history of the program) presenting counter evidence with fanfares and flourishes, seemingly unaware that the evidence she marshals weakens her own theories.  She makes a big deal of the fact that Reagan, when he had previously run for President, had often mentioned how intolerable he found the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction and it's requirement that we live in a state of nuclear terror.  This certainly puts the lie to the official story that she fabricated, but, more importantly, it indicates that, far from a function of political expediency, Reagan's dream of escaping the threat of nuclear weapons was long standing and very nearly central to his vision for his Presidency.  Apply Occam's Razor to Reagan's stated reason for building SDI and it turns out that his own words offer the simplest explanation.  Here's a chunk of his initial SDI speech: <br />    If the Soviet Union will join with us in our effort to achieve major arms reduction we will have <BR>    succeeded in stabilizing the nuclear balance. Nevertheless, it will still be necessary to rely on the <BR>    specter of retaliation, on mutual threat. And that's a sad commentary on the human condition. <BR>    Wouldn't it be better to save lives than to avenge them? Are we not capable of demonstrating our <BR>    peaceful intentions by applying all our abilities and our ingenuity to achieving a truly lasting <BR>    stability? I  think we are. Indeed, we must. <br />    After careful consultation with my advisers, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I believe there is a <BR>    way. Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope. It is that we embark on a <BR>    program to counterthe awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are defensive. Let us turn <BR>    to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base and that have given us the <BR>    quality of life we enjoy today. <br />    What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the <BR>    threat of instant U.S. retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept and destroy <BR>    strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies? <br />    I know this is a formidable, technical task, one that may not be accomplished before the end of this <BR>    century. Yet, current technology has attained a level of sophistication where it's reasonable for us to <BR>    begin this effort. It will take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts. There will be <BR>    failures and setbacks, just as there will be successes and breakthroughs. And as we proceed, we must <BR>    remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and maintaining a solid capability for flexible <BR>    response. But isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear <BR>    war? We know it is. <br />    In the meantime, we will continue to pursue real reductions in nuclear arms, negotiating from a <BR>	2001-11-04

Having lived in Spain for nearly thirty<br />years and become friends with folks like their landlady, Franco's daughter, Carmen, they found both<br />Franco's Spain and Franco's reputation in Spain to be much different within the country than they were<br />perceived from without.  With such connections, the authors were given extraordinary access to<br />members of Franco's family and inner circle and to former government ministers.  They have<br />combined this access with what was obviously quite extensive research to produce a scrupulously<br />documented (how often have you read a novel with citations and footnotes) account of how Franco<br />kept Spain out of the War, focussing on the years from 1940 to 1943, when Spanish acquiescence to<br />Hitler's demands would have allowed Axis forces to use the Spanish coast as a staging area for an attack<br />on Gibraltar and eventually complete control of the Mediterranean and North Africa.<br />The weaknesses of the book are mostly a function of the task it is trying to perform.  Characters are<br />required to recite large chunks of historical background, which is obviously artificial and somewhat<br />pedantic, but is also probably the most effective way of conveying the necessary information (it is<br />certainly less disruptive than the technique that Herman Wouk used in Winds of War, where he<br />interspersed chapters of an imaginary history of WWII).  And in almost every instance, the authors<br />give Franco the benefit of the doubt in regards to his motivations and the farsightedness of his vision.<br />This creates the impression, which even I find unlikely, that he never seriously considered joining the<br />Axis and intended all along to simply hold Hitler at bay until America joined the War and swung the<br />balance of power.<br />On the other hand, Franco has been treated so viciously by almost every other author (H. G. Wells<br />called him the &quot;murderous little Christian gentleman&quot;), that it's hard to begrudge one overly favorable<br />treatment.  Moreover, it is entirely plausible that Franco, who had after all fought to preserve a<br />traditional Spain, based on Church, Crown, and commerce, never seriously intended to allow the Nazis<br />a free hand in Spain.  No true patriot, which Franco must by any measure be considered, would fight<br />off the Comintern only to put his nation at the disposal of the National Socialists.<br />Meanwhile, the books strengths are significant.  First, there is a very real tension to the story, even<br />though we know its outcome, as this small and recently wartorn nation holds off Hitler, who is perched<br />on their border just waiting to pounce.  Second, there's the fascination of seeing people like Franco and<br />Canaris presented as three dimensional beings and as genuine heroes in the resistance to Hitler, rather<br />than as enemies of humanity, simply because they too were fascists.  Finally, books that challenge our<br />precious preconceived versions of events are so rare that it is always a good thing when one, especially<br />a really good one, comes along.urderous little Christian gentleman&quot;), that it's hard to begrudge one overly favorable <BR>treatment.

People may still recall the sensational form that her protest<br />took, her naked ride through Coventry, but few recall that she was protesting high rates of taxation<br />(imposed by her own husband : Leofric, the Earl of Mercia).<br />Leofric was one of the most powerful nobles of 11th Century Britain, and he and Godiva were major<br />patrons of the arts and religious institutions, Godiva apparently believing that such works would benefit<br />the peasantry.  But when she realized that what would actually be most beneficial to the poor would be<br />a reduction in their high tax burden she interceded with the Earl and asked him to lighten their load.<br />The Earl, one assumes jokingly, suggested that since Godiva was such a believer in the arts and since<br />the Greeks and Romans considered the human form itself to be great art, he would remove the local<br />taxes on everything but horses if she would ride through town in all her naked glory on horseback,<br />which she promptly did.  Later embellishments to what appears to have been an actual incident include<br />the addition of a voyeur who gazed upon her, despite admonishments that the townsfolk should avert<br />their eyes : we recall him as the original &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;.<br />This very fine historical novel by Steven James would be cause for celebration if all he did was restore<br />our memory of the Lady.  But there's more.  Several years ago I lamented the fact that Hope Muntz's<br />classic, The Golden Warrior, with its thrilling tale of the conflict between Harold Godwinson and<br />William the Bastard (eventually, unfortunately, the Conqueror) had fallen out of print.  Many consider<br />The Golden Warrior to be the greatest historical novel ever written, and it certainly ranks with the<br />best.  I'd still urge folks to try to track down a copy, but, in the meantime, Steven James has cleverly<br />tied the legend of Lady Godiva into the story of Harold and produced a thoroughly engaging historical<br />fiction of his own.<br />James uses a few fictional characters and a healthy dollop of imagination to bind these storylines<br />together, perhaps more tightly than they need to be (the Epilogue is particularly unnecessary).  But as<br />the drama builds towards the Battle of Hastings (in 1066) the reader gets so swept up in the course of<br />events that all license taken with the story is forgiven.  One warning though, I loaned my copy of<br />Golden Warrior to a friend and he refused to finish the book because he couldn't stand to read of<br />Harold's eventual defeat.  I excoriated him at the time, but found myself reacting similarly towards the<br />end of Godiva and the Golden Dragon.  Harold's attempt to defend his kingdom--from a hostile and<br />corrupt papacy; from the treacheries of his own brothers; from a Northern invasion by King Haraald of<br />Norway; and from conquest by William and the Normans--is too heroic and too nearly succeeds for the<br />tender hearted reader to easily accept his ultimate failure.  It is all just ineffably sad, though it goes a<br />long way to explaining the rise of centralized nation-states, with a single political authority capable of<br />reigning in rebellious rival claimants to power.<br />This then is one of the more enjoyable historical novels I've read in recent years.  For all of us who<br />await with great impatience the next offering from Sharon Kay Penman, here's a book to tide us over.<br />And for anyone who's forgotten, or never knew, why Lady Godiva was a &quot;freedom rider&quot;, this book<br />restores a real heroine to her rightful place in the pantheon.<br />GRADE : A-and it certainly ranks with the <BR>best.

Othello is a noble warrior, but very much an innocent and far too trusting of<br />other men's counsel, and so he is easy prey for Iago, who in turn may be Shakespeare's greatest villain,<br />because he is so purely evil.  Richard III, by contrast, while a force of malevolence, is also just more<br />interesting and intelligent than those around him.  Iago has none of Richard's beguiling qualities, he is<br />little more than the sum of his own jealousies and hatreds.  And so, when this noblest hero and this<br />most vile villain collide, the events that follow are tragic in the human sense, not merely in a dramatic<br />sense.  We mourn the loss of a superior being, in Othello, not just the general destruction of life.<br />Othello is also distinguished by just how trivial are the provocations that set events in motion.  Iago<br />uses little more than a single prop, an embroidered kerchief, and his own treacherous words to bring<br />about a series of deaths and the fall of a great man.  In this sense it is the most writerly of plays,<br />reflects most fully Shakespeare's own confidence that he can take such slender threads and weave a<br />compelling drama.  One despairs of ever saying anything novel about Shakespeare, he's been written<br />about so much, but the thought occurs that Iago might represent Shakespeare himself.  Consider that it<br />is Iago's tongue and a flimsy plot device of his contrivance that force the action of the drama and his<br />jealousy of the handsome and much-heralded leading man that provides the motive.  Surely<br />Shakespeare, who so loved the device of the play within a play, might have relished the idea of a play<br />that's a simulacrum of his own profession?  I like to think so.<br />But in the final analysis, Othello does not capture us in the same way that some of the other tragedies<br />do.  The main characters are so unambiguous that they lack a certain depth.  The plot is so contrived<br />and so inevitable that it seems mechanical rather than natural.  You can imagine a world in which<br />Hamlet exacts his revenge without hesitating or where Lear realizes he's acting like a fool, but you<br />can't imagine a world in which Iago allows Othello and Desdemona to live happily ever after.  That's a<br />pretty serious weakness.<br />GRADE : B+in the final analysis, Othello does not capture us in the same way that some of the other tragedies<br />do.

But we are four decades along in this social experiment and, as Judith Wallerstein and her colleagues capably demonstrate, it's time to acknowledge that the reformers were catastrophically wrong and that their error has dire and continuing consequences for our society.  It's important to note that the authors are not saying that divorce is bad per se, they well understand that some family situations are so unhealthy that it is better for all concerned that the marriage end, but they do provide important insights into the long term effects that even relatively amicable divorces have on the children of divorce, effects which endure into adulthood.<br />One of the most important contributions of their study is a point that should be obvious : children don't particularly care that their parents might be happier if they could get out of their marriages, they want them to stay together.  This is a simple function of the fact that children are even more monstrously selfish than the rest of us.  Less obvious, but still commonsensical, is the idea that the divorce of one's parents is likely to permanently shape your own personality, your emotional well being, and your capacity and willingness to trust and love others.  Progressives may not like it, but it is nonetheless true that the nuclear family is the most ancient, powerful, and important social arrangement of humankind.  To imagine that children, the most vulnerable and impressionable members of that unit, would be able to just shrug of its breakdown is absurd on its face.  Divorce quite naturally terrifies children, calling into question the general stability of family and love.  Little wonder then that adult children of divorce experience great anxiety and difficulty when they try to establish relationships and form families of their own.<br />The authors illustrate these points and many others with examples from actual cases they have studied.  This is very effective as a way of personalizing their arguments, but has left them open to legitimate criticism that their work does not meet rigorous scientific standards.  In the end, you are likely to judge their work by whether it confirms or contradicts your own political viewpoint.  But it's awfully hard to just dismiss their findings.<br />In the conclusion to the book, they offer some very moderate and tentative proposals for policy changes that would reduce the negative impact of divorce on children.  As they note, we have created a culture of divorce, one in which 45% of all first marriages end in divorce, and 65% of second marriages.  This should be intolerable to us, because it essentially defeats the purposes for which the institution was created and calls into the question the benefits that we extend to married couples.  Personally, I would incorporate some of the authors' suggestions but add several, much harsher ones, of my own :<br />  (1)  As they suggest, children should be given a strong voice in custody and visitation matters.  It<br />  should be less important to us as a society what the divorcing parents desire and more<br />  important what their children wish.<br />  (2)  Instructing school age kids in good marriage and parenting skills seems harmless enough,<br />  though unlikely to do much good.<br />  (3)  Likewise, encouraging businesses to adopt more family-friendly policies--flextime and the<br />  like--is certainly worthwhile, but doesn't seem likely to have a major impact.<br />  (4)  Mandatory counseling prior to divorce is also unobjectionable.  Though I'd have it done<br />  through churches, rather than under government auspices.<br />  (5)  In addition, just as we extend tax and other benefits to married couples, there should be tax<br />  penalties associated with divorce, particularly in cases where children are involved.  The<br />  authors note that people like the current ease of divorce because it provides them with great<br />  freedom.  But freedom must carry with it certain responsibilities and obligations.<br />  (6)  Similarly, you should only be allowed one bite at the apple.  Divorced persons should, if they<br />  are allowed to remarry, not be granted the same benefits as they were the first time.  In law,<br />  they should be treated as singles.<br />  (7)  Tax benefits, student loan provisions, school vouchers, mortgage breaks, etc. should all be<br />  greatly expanded for married couples.  A society has no more important task than the raising<br />  of its next generation, and anything government can do to make parents task easier should be<br />  done.  The best way to do this is not through new programs but by making it more affordable<br />  to have and to raise children.<br />  (8)  All of these provisions should be waived in cases where there has been physical or sexual<br />  abuse of either spouse or children or where one spouse has committed adultery.  Divorce<br />  should be made an unattractive option for couples who are merely unhappy, but must remain a<br />  viable option where people are genuinely endangered or are sinned against.  At the same time<br />  courts should punish such behaviors, including adultery, much more severely than they<br />  historically have.<br />These reforms, and given time we can probably come up with more, will raise obvious objections.  People don't much care to be forced to accept responsibilities; they much prefer being given freedoms.  Tough.  Marriage is not a right; it is a privilege.  Marriage is a civic institution which exists to fulfill certain set purposes--chief among them are procreation and child-rearing.  It would be great if all married couples were happy, but as a society this is only a secondary concern.  The stability of the institution is more important than the happiness of the participants and their happiness is actually unimportant when it has a negative impact on their children.<br />Of course, I'm a child of divorced parents, so all of the forgoing may just be sour grapes and the product of my own damaged psyche...tax and other benefits to married couples, there should be tax <BR>            penalties associated with divorce, particularly in cases where children are involved.

And since in a democracy the masses will wield power, the prospects for the West appeared pretty bleak :<br />  Considering mankind's indifference to freedom, their easy gullibility and their facile response to<br />  conditioning, one might very plausibly argue that collectivism is the political mode best suited to<br />  their disposition and their capacities.  Under its regime the citizen, like the soldier, is relieved of the<br />  burden of initiative and is divested of all responsibility, save for doing as he is told.  He takes what<br />  is allotted to him, obeys orders, and beyond that he has no care.  Perhaps, then, this is as much as<br />  the vast psychically-anthropoid majority are up to, and a status of permanent irresponsibility under<br />  collectivism would be most congenial and satisfactory to them.<br />  Given a just and generous administration of collectivism this might very well be so; but even on<br />  that extremely large and dubious presumption the matter is academic, because of all political modes<br />  a just and generous collectivism is in its nature the most impermanent.  each new activity or<br />  function that the State assumes means an enlargement of officialdom, an augmentation of<br />  bureaucracy.  In other words, it opens one more path of least resistance to incompetent,<br />  unscrupulous and inferior persons whom Epstean's law has always at hand, intent only on satisfying<br />  their needs and desires with the least possible exertion.  Obviously the collectivist State, with its<br />  assumption of universal control and regulation, opens more of these paths than any other political<br />  mode; there is virtually no end of them.  Hence, however just and generous an administration of<br />  collectivism may be at the outset, and however fair its prospects may then be, it is immediately set<br />  upon and honeycombed by hordes of the most venal and untrustworthy persons that Epstean's law<br />  can rake together; and in virtually no time every one of the regime's innumerable bureaux and<br />  departments is rotted to the core.  In 1821, with truly remarkable foresight, Mr. Jefferson wrote in a<br />  letter to Macon that 'our Government is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it<br />  will pass to destruction, to wit: by consolidation first [i.e., centralisation] and then corruption, its<br />  necessary consequence.'<br />It will of course be argued, with the perfection of twenty-twenty hindsight, that Nock (and Jefferson and Jefferson's other conservative heirs) overstated the case and fell pray to hysterics.  We are after all in the midst (hopefully not at the end) of what has been a twenty year pause in the process of collectivization.  The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc crumbled under the weight of just the kind of corruption that Nock feared, and they proved much less capable of producing material goods than even Nock might have expected.  Likewise, many of the Socialist countries of the West have had to turn to at least some level of reprivatization in order to prop up their Social Welfare systems and to revive their moribund economies.  Here in the States, we managed to avoid the worst excesses, keeping Health Care at least partially out of the hands of government, and have taken some baby steps towards reprivatizing such programs as Welfare and Social Security.  But the process has been uneven and victories have been only partial and have come only after fierce battle.  One need only look at the debates over the Clinton Health Care Plan, Welfare Reform and Social Security Privatization to see how little regardthe Left really has for Freedom, always preferring the &quot;Security&quot; of having Government do for us all.<br />But even if this pause in the march of Collectivization should prove to be of long-lasting duration, it should not be seen as a refutation of Nock's ideas, but as a tribute to them.  For if Nock's arguments seem self-evident to us now, it is all too easy to forget how truly superfluous they seemed in 1943.  Nock, who was writing before even Hayek's Road to Serfdom had been published, is one of the incredibly small group of men who kept alive the idea of freedom and who resisted the, at the time seemingly inevitable, force of collectivization.  If his most dire predictions did not come true it is not solely because he overestimated the opposition, but because a powerful counterrevolution eventually rose up, structured around ideas like his, and it is in this regard that modern conservatism owes him a tremendous, almost completely unacknowledged, debt.<br />There is much more in this wonderful book and Nock explains himself much better than I have.  He writes beautifully and with great humor.  On nearly every page you'll find an idea or a turn of phrase that you'll want to pause and turn over in your mind.  I can not recommend this book highly enough.  I can't wait to read it again and everything else I can find by this least superfluous of men.<br />GRADE : A+to see how little regard the Left really has for Freedom, always preferring the &quot;Security&quot; of having Government do for us all. <br />But even if this pause in the march of Collectivization should prove to be of long-lasting duration, it should not be seen as a refutation of Nock's ideas, but as a tribute to them.

Here he makes a series of vital points, several of which concern the manner in which the mission was carried out, but two of which are broader : first, that the mission succeeded.  Yes, there was a cost, but when you strip away everything else, the fact remains that this relatively small group of U.S. soldiers was able to complete its mission despite meeting unexpectedly massive and determined resistance.  Mind you this was urban warfare, which we well understand to present some of the most difficult circumstances imaginable.  While we did lose eighteen men and four helicopters (two at the scene, two back at the command base), it is nonetheless truly remarkable that approximately 150 men of the Rangers, SEALs, and Delta Forces were essentially able to fight off thousands of hostile enemy for an entire day and a night, before being rescued the next day by a large multi-national force.  From a purely Special Forces viewpoint, the mission was indeed a success.<br />One of the great services that Bowden's book has provided is just to restore this understanding.  He recounts how the men who fought this battle returned home to face blank stares when they mentioned it.  Most folks had never heard of it and those who had, who remembered only the searing image of American casualties being dragged through the streets by the Somali mob, assumed the mission had been a debacle.  Rather, as Bowden writes :<br />  No matter how critically history records the policy that led up to this fight, nothing can diminish<br />  the professionalism and dedication of the Rangers and Special Forces units who fought there that<br />  day.<br />Considering the missions that they are being called on to fulfill now and for the foreseeable future, it is well for us all to realize that and for them to take pride in their service, even in incidents, like this one, which make the politicians squeamish.<br />The second really insightful point that Bowden makes is that while we went into Somalia thinking that its people must want peace, this proved not to be the case.  What started as simply a humanitarian effort to get food to the starving (in the closing days of the Bush Administration) soon turned into an effort to impose peace between warring clans.  We believed, in our naivet&eacute;, that this was what the people of Somalia wanted.  Instead, as an unnamed State Department official told Bowden :<br />  Somalia was the experience that taught us that people in these places bear much of the responsibility<br />  for things being the way they are.  The hatred and the killing continues because they want it to.  Or<br />  because they don't want peace enough to stop it.<br />There is an important lesson to be learned from this fact, one that it is not at all clear that we have learned : peace in the middle of a war is much harder to maintain than the peace imposed after the war.  When, repeatedly throughout the 20th Century, we have tried to bring about peace before the armies in the field have been destroyed--WWI, WWII (where the Soviets were left intact), Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia--the legacy is pretty clear : it doesn't work.  On the other hand, when, as in the case of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, we have utterly destroyed our enemies, we have been able to rebuild peaceful allies in their stead.  If we are going to continue to intervene in the wars of others, particularly in civil wars, it seems obvious that we need to choose one side or the other and then completely destroy the opposition.<br />Make no mistake either, this is a choice that is available to us.  The failure to annihilate our foes has not been a function of our inability to do so but of our unwillingness to do so.  In this regard, Bowden writes about the perceptions of one Delta Force sergeant, Paul Howe  :<br />  Victory was for those willing to fight and die.  Intellectuals could theorize until they sucked their<br />  thumbs right off their hands, but in the real world, power still flowed from the barrel of a gun. If<br />  you wanted the starving masses of Somalia to eat, then you had to out-muscle men like this Aidid,<br />  for whom starvation worked. You could send in your bleeding-heart do-gooders, you could hold<br />  hands and pray and sing hootenanny songs and invoke the great gods CNN and BBC, but the only<br />  way to finally open the roads to the big-eyed babies was to show up with more guns. And in this<br />  real world, nobody had more or better guns than America.<br />American failures have been a result of the refusal to use those guns.  This refusal may be appropriate, but it does lead to failure and ultimately costs American lives, because the refusal generally only comes after we're already involved.  We head off to these foreign lands and get embroiled in their unfamiliar quarrels, often because of the pictures we see on CNN or the BBC, and at the behest of the Kumbaya-singers, but, once there, find that we lack the brutality and determination that would be required to solve the problems we find there.<br />We would all, of course, prefer that such conflicts would yield to peaceful resolution, that warring parties would set down their arms and stop fighting.  But it is unrealistic to expect them to do so.  And peace, though a laudable goal, can not be the primary aim of warfare; victory must be.  Where, as in Somalia and Bosnia, we are unable or unwilling to choose between equally repellent contestants, we should just stay out altogether.<br />In Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden manages to tell a genuinely thrilling story and at the same time illustrate fundamental points about what America's unparalleled fighting forces can and can not do.  The book, like all the best books about the reality of warfare, is timeless, but its lessons are particularly timely today, as we send such men off to fight in other foreign lands, for it is not at all clear that we are willing to continue this fight until the enemy, rightly understood, is destroyed.  If all it will take is one incident like this for us to get cold feet, then it is better not to go at all.  Men like those who fought and won the Battle of the Black Sea are more than willing to go to war when their country calls on them, but they want an opportunity to win the war, not just one battle.  As Bowden says of the men he interviewed :<br />  I was struck by how little bitterness there is among the men who underwent this ordeal.  What anger<br />  exists relates more to the decision to call off the mission the day after the battle than anything that<br />  happened during it.<br />Such anger is justified and understandable.  Let us give them no reason to feel the same way at the end of their next mission.<br />GRADE : A+nd die.

We head off to these foreign lands and get embroiled in their unfamiliar quarrels, often because of the pictures we see on CNN or the BBC, and at the behest of the Kumbaya-singers, but, once there, find that we lack the brutality and determination that would be required to solve the problems we find there. <br />We would all, of course, prefer that such conflicts would yield to peaceful resolution, that warring parties would set down their arms and stop fighting.  But it is unrealistic to expect them to do so.  And peace, though a laudable goal, can not be the primary aim of warfare; victory must be.  Where, as in Somalia and Bosnia, we are unable or unwilling to choose between equally repellent contestants, we should just stay out altogether. <br />In Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden manages to tell a genuinely thrilling story and at the same time illustrate fundamental points about what America's unparalleled fighting forces can and can not do.   The book, like all the best books about the reality of warfare, is timeless, but its lessons are particularly timely today, as we send such men off to fight in other foreign lands, for it is not at all clear that we are willing to continue this fight until the enemy, rightly understood, is destroyed.  If all it will take is one incident like this for us to get cold feet, then it is better not to go at all.  Men like those who fought and won the Battle of the Black Sea are more than willing to go to war when their country calls on them, but they want an opportunity to win the war, not just one battle.  As Bowden says of the men he interviewed : <br />    I was struck by how little bitterness there is among the men who underwent this ordeal.  What anger <BR>    exists relates more to the decision to call off the mission the day after the battle than anything that <BR>    happened during it. <br />Such anger is justified and understandable.  Let us give them no reason to feel the same way at the end of their next mission. <br />GRADE : A+	2001-10-23

Huntington is almost certainly correct that the next several years will see a clash between Western Civilization and Islamic Civilization, but the result of this encounter is foreordained, if not the particulars of how we'll arrive at the conclusion.  There are really only two alternatives : either Islam will reform itself and become more like the West on its own--including, most importantly, separating church and state and accepting greater economic inequalities as the price to be paid for greater growth in general--or Islam will be devastated in war and will be rebuilt, even if against its will, along Western lines, as happened in Japan after WWII.  It just is not possible to envision a scenario in which Islam succeeds in defeating the West.  If, God forbid, the West ever really had its back to the wall it would undoubtedly unleash a thermonuclear, biological and/or chemical holocaust in the Middle East (and probably Indonesia) which would essentially annihilate Islam.  As Victor Davis Hanson has written in his terrific book Carnage and Culture, the single factor that has been most significant in the repeated victory of the West in global conflicts has been the ruthlessness and finality with which it prosecutes war.  The West has been more willing than other civilizations to utterly destroy enemies.  There is no reason to believe that it would not do so again.<br />Despite these weaknesses in his thesis in its broadest form, Huntington's book is invaluable in its narrower form.  First, by warning that the clash of civilizations that genuinely differ from one another will continue to be a central feature of world politics, he provides a much needed warning that the West must deal with Islam and Communist China as rivals, not merely as alternative types of societies.  As regards China, we can somewhat assume that the forces of capitalism that have been unleashed will eventually subvert the authoritarian political system.  History has proven again and again that you can not provide your citizens a little bit of freedom without them eventually demanding more.  China today much resembles Gorbachev's USSR, a society on the verge of crumbling which needs only strong and consistent pressure from the United States to fall apart completely.  The most effective ways of applying this pressure have the great benefit of also being good policy for the U.S.  We should invite Taiwan, Russia, Japan, India, Australia, New Zealand, and the moderate nations of Southeast Asia to join NAFTA.  To the greatest extent possible we should also seek to make such an organization a strategic and military alliance, with its might directed specifically against China and, to a lesser extent, Indonesia.  The U.S. should also step up its Missile Defense program and should simultaneously pursue the development of offensive space-based weapons.  The goal of the latter should be to develop the capacity to eliminate any nation's nuclear arsenal and its communications satellites in a first strike.  At that point we would be in a position to impose nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament on the rest of the world.<br />Second, as regards Islam, while Turkey and Iran offer fascinating case studies in the eventual possibility of Islam and democracy co-existing, both have struggled so mightily and are such unique situations, both having been run by pro-Western dictators for an extended period of time, that it seems only realistic to assume that Islam and the West may eventually engage in a widespread conflict.  It would obviously be preferable to have Islam reform itself, but one searches in vain for leaders, religious or secular, with the stature, ideology and steadfastness of purpose to lead such a fundamental restructuring of the entire Islamic Civilization.  In the absence of such a leader, leaders, or a coherent reformist movement, and in the absence of any evidence of willingness on the part of the current leaders of Islamic nations to countenance suchreform, conflict becomes increasingly likely.  It is therefore necessary for the West to plan and prepare for this eventuality, even as we seek ways to avoid it.<br />Unfortunately, we have come to the point, not infrequent in such clashes, where the course of future events by and large depends on the doomed civilization.  In the 1930s and 40s, German and Japanese fascists wrote their own death warrants by declaring war on the United States.  There followed a total war, with the demand for unconditional surrender, that left those two nations virtually unrecognizable in its aftermath.  The Soviet Union well realized that it would meet the same fate if ever it forced a final showdown, so it festered along for several more decades before reforming itself out of existence.  It is now up to Islam which course it pursues.  They can confront us now and get it over with quickly or die a lingering death, but, make no mistake, these are the alternatives.  Those in the Islamic world who view globalization and American hegemony as a lethal threat to Islam are correct.  The only debate now is over how the death is administered, by us, because they force us to, or by them, because they realize its in their own best interest.<br />Finally, Mr. Huntington asserts that :<br />  The principal responsibility of Western leaders is not to attempt to reshape other civilizations in the<br />  image of the West, which is beyond their declining power, but to preserve, protect and renew the<br />  unique qualities of Western civilization.<br />While I would contend that we can do both, he is absolutely correct that the great danger to Western values arises from within.  This is the danger inherent in multiculturalism.  It's all fine and dandy to study and learn from the great variety of civilizations that Man has created, but we must never make the mistake of treating them as all equally valid.  We must make a simple but essential judgment that Western Civilization is superior to the alternatives.  Having made this judgment, the two most important steps to be taken are to inculcate these values in our schools and demand that immigrants accept them.  To allow successive generations of young people to grow up with little knowledge of Western Civilization, and even less appreciation of its greatness, is to court our own extinction.<br />We have seen though, particularly in the weeks since the 9-11 bombings, just how difficult it is for people to take even the first step of accepting the core judgment.  The storm of protest that descended upon Italian Prime Minister Sylvio Berlusconi when he stated that Western Civilization is superior was indicative of a kind of soul-sickness and self-loathing in the West that is a far greater threat to our way of life and the eventual extension of freedom and prosperity to every corner of the globe than Islam is or Communism ever was.<br />It is nearly unthinkable to consider that some good may come from the events of September 11th, but in the long run this may well be the case.  If those events force upon us the realization that civilizations do clash, that their different values produce much different ways of life, and that our way of life is preferable to others, then perhaps we can give a very special meaning to the victims' deaths.  If we can once again become forceful defenders of and advocates for Western Civilization, then they will have died in the cause of freedom.<br />Sixty years ago, the great conservative critic, Albert Jay Nock, said that he considered himself : &quot;...the unworthy inheritor of a great tradition.&quot;  So are we all, but let us strive to be worthy.  Let us, who have been so fortunate as to benefit from Western Civilization, rededicate ourselves to defending and extending it.  We must, and we will, win the Clash of Civilizations that Samuel P. Huntington has so helpfully reminded us is still going on.  But having won, we must remain vigilant in our defense of our cultural inheritance.<br />GRADE : B+he alternatives.

In a series of essays, various critics, of dubious but seemingly impressive pedigree, read the Pooh stories through the distorted lenses of their own literary/political/philosophical/psychological perspectives.  It turned out of course that the book, published in 1964, had been the work of a young English professor at Berkeley (of all places) and was a parody, skewering several of the then current schools of criticism.  Now, nearly forty years later, retired from academia, Professor Crews gives today's critics the satirical drubbing they so richly deserve in this manufactured set of lectures to the Modern Language Association convention.  Happily, this second effort is just as funny as the first, though it is somewhat depressing to realize that his targets have become even easier to poke fun at because, one shudders at the thought, their theories are even more ridiculous than those of their predecessors.<br />I'll not pretend to understand all the nuances of what Professor Crews has written; heck, I don't even recognize all the schools of thought he's sending up, nor all the specific people he seems to have targeted.  Everyone will discern Harold Bloom in the person of Orpheus Bruno, whose lecture is titled The Importance of Being Portly, and whose last three books are titled : My Vico, My Shakespeare, My God!; What You Don't Know Hurts Me; and Read These Books.  And one assumes that Dudley Cravat III, whose contribution, Twilight of the Dogs, is one long bellow against the &quot;sickness unto death&quot; of the modern university, must incorporate at least a significant touch of William Bennett.  Knowing who the victims are in these instances definitely adds to the enjoyment.  Unfortunately (no, make that fortunately) most of the other models for these characters will be so obscure to anyone outside academia that the reader, at least this reader, won't know recognize them.<br />You can figure out, without too much trouble, that specific lectures are aimed at Deconstruction, Marxism, Feminism, Queer Theory, Postcolonialism, Evolutionary Psychology and so forth.  Much of the enjoyment of the book lies in the way Crews can make the Pooh stories fit these absurd theories.  He'll leave you half convinced that the Hundred Acre Wood is alternately a seething pit of repressed homosexual longings or pedophiliac torture; the oppressed colony of a brutal imperialist master; and a laboratory of Darwinism.  The very capacity of these simple children's stories to bear the weight of each of these ideologies only serves to undermine them all.  Such infinitely plastic criticisms must ultimately be about the theories themselves, not about the text that is supposedly under consideration.<br />One final feature of the book is particularly amusing, and especially frightening.  Though the lectures are obviously made up, the footnotes appear to all refer to genuine sources, with titles like &quot;The Foul and the Fragrant: Odor and the French Social Imagination&quot; and &quot;The Vestal and the Fasces: Hegel, Lacan, Property, and the Feminine&quot;.  I suppose someone trying to complete a doctoral thesis will write just about anything, but, please God, tell me no one has actually ever read them.<br />It all makes for very funny reading, but with a serious subtext.  This is the kind of garbage that kids are being taught, with a straight face, in our schools today.  That scares the heck out of me.  Hopefully Professor Crews will keep that skewer pointy.

But his country wife, Shuyu, refuses to grant him a divorce, despite the lovelessness of<br />their arranged marriage.  The moral strictures of Communist society are sufficiently severe that Lin<br />Kong and Manna Wu are forced to wait until Shuyu gives her okay, which she continues to withhold<br />while her daughter by Lin Kong is growing up.  Thus, the lovers are forced into a decades long<br />holding pattern, until Lin Kong compares himself to a sleepwalker and wonders if he's not more in<br />love with an illusion than with a real being.<br />Though this story is sometimes maddeningly slow, it is quite beautifully told, in very direct and<br />stripped down language, and does develop a certain tension as we wait for Shuyu to set Lin Kong free.<br />Along the way Ha Jin, who was himself a Red Army soldier, provides a fascinating cultural history of<br />China in the 60s and 70s.  But the real power of the story is allegorical.  Lin Kong wants to shuck off<br />the traditional China (Shuyu) and embrace the new, modern, Communist China (Manna).  But as the<br />process of attaining the new drags on, with no fulfillment in sight, he begins to question why he<br />wanted Manna in the first place, wonders whether he even retains the capacity to love, or whether the<br />continuous deferral of love and suspension of life has emotionally paralyzed him, and grows nostalgic<br />for Shuyu and the more traditional China of the village he grew up in.  <br />One imagines this must somewhat parallel Ha Jin's own experience, and/or that of many people he<br />knew in China.  At any rate, he deftly takes one of the oldest of romantic plots--the dependable and<br />decent spouse abandoned for the sexier, but ultimately illusory, lover--and imposes the story of<br />Communist China upon it.

The future neoconservatives mostly came<br />  from relatively recent immigrant stock.  It is arguable, though certainly unproven, that such people<br />  in America feel a stronger need  than those of longer American lineage to display their credentials<br />  as Americans; or rather, that those whose families came over on the Mayflower feel that there is<br />  nothing incompatible between deep patriotism and a propensity to shout about what needs to be<br />  changed.<br />  -The World Turned Right Side Up : A History of the Conservative Ascendancy in America<br />(1996)  (Godfrey Hodgson)<br />Boy, Godfrey Hodgson really hits the nail on the head there.  Norman Podhoretz's book, My Love<br />Affair With America, is basically a protracted attempt to suggest that he loves America more than any<br />of his former rivals on the Left, or current rivals on the Right.  Podhoretz famously broke ranks with<br />the intellectual New York set in the 1970's, having determined that their anti-Americanism, most<br />ostentatiously displayed during the Vietnam War, neither jibed with his own life experiences--the<br />meteoric rise of a poor Jewish child of immigrants to respected writer status--nor was compatible with<br />the need to maintain a militarily strong and assertive America, to stand as a final guarantor of an<br />embattled Israel's continued existence.  He has an easy time rewinning his old battle with the radical<br />counterculture (though he's unable to resist the compulsion to claim credit for having created that<br />counterculture in the first place).  Their anti-Americanism is a result of their genuine opposition to<br />freedom, which is America's organizing principle.  They do not wish to perfect America, but to<br />destroy it and remake it in an image of their utopian (or dystopian) fantasies.  Podhoretz gives them<br />yet another well-deserved drubbing.<br />But then he takes on the modern Right, and here he founders badly :<br />  In the mid-1990s there unexpectedly came an outburst of anti-Americanism even among some of<br />  the very conservatives I thought had been permanently immunized against it...I was already pushing<br />  seventy, and it made me a little tired to think of going back into combat over a phenomenon that I<br />  had fondly imagined I would never have to deal with again, and certainly not on the Right<br />The anti-Americanism he's talking about is the harsh, but loving, cultural criticism of Bill Bennett and<br />Robert Bork, and the tentative suggestions on the Religious Right that the Supreme Court may have so<br />far departed from the Constitution in its decisions on social issues, specifically abortion and<br />Church/State issues, that it is no longer a legitimate institution.  Podhoretz is horrified by these trends<br />and seeks to read them out of the Conservative movement, but they were there long before him and<br />will remain long after.<br />The problem for Podhoretz, and for neoconservatism in general, is the absence of a core political<br />philosophy.  The Left believes that the central duty of government is to guarantee equality of<br />outcomes among the citizenry and that government is capable of solving social problems and<br />effectively running the economy.  Classic Conservatism is structured around a countervailing belief in<br />freedom, which necessitates a very limited government, but strong social institutions, and, though it<br />requires equality of opportunity, accepts that the resulting outcomes will be very different.<br />Neoconservatism is really only interested insupporting Israel and opposing quotas, it's largely agnostic<br />on the other issues and has no firm view of the proper role of government generally.  On social issues,<br />a natural distrust of Christian conservatism and the fact that neoconservatism arose in the urban milieu,<br />combine to create a willingness to countenance big government, and the need for a massive military<br />requires big government. On the other hand, if equality is enforced by the state, it will work to the<br />detriment of groups, like Jews, who are disproportionately successful, so there's a reluctance to trust<br />government too far.  This naked self-interest is certainly legitimate, but it's hardly a coherent political<br />philosophy.<br />That Podhoretz is only marginally conservative becomes clear from the fact that he almost completely<br />ignores the question of the size and role of government, from his dismissal of objections to the 1964<br />Civil Rights Act, from his failure to discuss, except in passing, the free market economic philosophy<br />of folks like Milton Friedman and F. A. Hayek, and from his failure to comprehend why abortion is<br />such a salient issue on the Right.  Even more revealing is his thinly disguised contempt for the<br />conservative intellectuals of the first half of the century, who either go unmentioned (Albert Jay Nock,<br />for example) or are dismissed as cranks (like the Agrarians--Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren, etc.).<br />He seems to think that conservatism was born in the 1950s, only became a significant political<br />movement in the post Vietnam era (not coincidentally, just after he joined it) and consists of little<br />more than nationalism.<br />Were that true, were conservatism nothing more than a blind patriotism, of recent vintage, then he<br />would be right to criticize cultural conservatives for questioning the moral climate of the country and<br />the direction in which it is heading.  But conservatism, even American conservatism, antedates<br />America.  And conservatism has endured precisely because it offers such a powerful critique of<br />America.  In Albert Jay Nock's great book, Memoirs of a Superfluous Man, he says the following :<br />  Burke touches [the] matter of patriotism with a searching phrase.  'For us to love our country,' he<br />  said, 'our country ought to be lovely.'  I have sometimes thought that here may be the rock on<br />  which Western civilization will finally shatter itself.  Economism can build a society which is rich,<br />  prosperous, powerful, even one which has a reasonably wide diffusion of material well-being.  It<br />  can not build one which is lovely, one which has savour and depth, and which exercises the<br />  irresistible attraction that loveliness wields.  Perhaps by the time economism has run its course the<br />  society it has built may be tired of itself, bored by its own hideousness, and may despairingly<br />  consent to annihilation, aware that it is too ugly to be let live any longer.<br />By economism, Nock means a kind of unfettered materialism or consumerism.  These lines, prophetic<br />anyway, seem even more prescient in light of the events of September 11th.  There is a palpable sense<br />in America's continuing discussion of the events that the America that died on September 11th<br />deserved to die (though the victims certainly did not), that it was too self-centered, too trivial, too<br />degenerate.  People have now judged the America of the 1990s, which Podhoretz is here defending<br />against conservative critics, and, as W. H. Auden said of an earlier time, they have determined it to be<br />&quot;a low dishonest decade.&quot;<br />In the final pages of the book Podhoretz offers a dayyenu, a list of each of the things that would have<br />been sufficient for us to owe America a debt of gratitude.  After a brief, and platitudinous, generic list,<br />including such things as &quot;domestic tranquillity&quot; (whichone is tempted to point out that China too<br />enjoys), he gets to his real reasons for feeling patriotic, and they are all about the success he's made of<br />himself : &quot;...America...sent me to a great university...&quot;; &quot;...America handed me a magazine of my own<br />to run...&quot;; &quot;...America saw to it that I would live in an apartment in Manhattan...&quot;;  &quot;...America<br />arranged for me to build a country house...&quot;.  It's utterly vacuous and truly appalling.<br />Freedom is vital to everything that America stands for.  It makes possible the kind of rags to riches<br />story that Podhoretz has lived.  But it is not enough.  Conservatives demand freedom, but also believe<br />that our country &quot;ought to be lovely.&quot;  This loveliness consists mostly of an adherence to the eternal<br />values of the Judeo-Christian tradition, of which, as Nock says, we are unworthy inheritors.  And right<br />there is another key element, humility.  Conservatives realize that our inheritance is too precious to<br />experiment with willy-nilly and so seek to conserve as much as can possibly be conserved of that<br />tradition.

For if Nock's arguments seem self-evident to us now, it is all too easy to forget how truly superfluous they seemed in 1943.  Nock, who was writing before even Hayek's Road to Serfdom had been published, is one of the incredibly small group of men who kept alive the idea of freedom and who resisted the, at the time seemingly inevitable, force of collectivization.  If his most dire predictions did not come true it is not solely because he overestimated the opposition, but because a powerful counterrevolution eventually rose up, structured around ideas like his, and it is in this regard that modern conservatism owes him a tremendous, almost completely unacknowledged, debt.	2001-10-17

For Love of a Game is a previously unpublished baseball<br />novella that Jeff Shaara found amongst his father's paper after he died.  Baseball was apparently a<br />great love of his father's and that love is apparent in this work.<br />The story concerns a future Hall of Fame pitcher, Billy Chapel, who has spent his whole career with<br />one team, but now as he nears the end of his career he learns that he's been traded.  As he takes the<br />mound for his final game of the season he ponders whether it will be the last of his career.<br />Compounding his problems, his long time girlfriend, Carol, has just told him that she's leaving.  Billy<br />has always been a consummate professional, driven by respect for himself and the game, but like many<br />athletes, he's remained somewhat immature, a status that is best reflected in his inability to<br />acknowledge, to her or to himself, that he loves Carol.  Over the course of a brilliantly pitched game,<br />Billy has to come to terms with the reality he has been able to hold off until now.  He has to grow up.<br />Shaara tells Billy's story as a kind of internal monologue, which inevitably makes for a talky and,<br />despite the intercut action of the game, somewhat claustrophobia-inducing tale.  But Chapel is nearly<br />religious in his commitment to excellence and his determination to always use his gifts to the utmost of<br />his ability.  He brings a refreshing respect and seriousness to his craft and takes deserving pride in<br />what he has accomplished.  Because of this, we can actually believe that he is capable of taking on the<br />responsibilities he now faces.  He's a very likable character, but more than that, he's admirable, both as<br />an athlete and as a man.  And that's more than enough to carry the book through some slow spots.<br />GRADE : B	2001-10-15

But I can't fathom Bloom's statement that :<br />  It is my personal touchstone for the sublime of prose fiction, to me the best story in the world, or<br />  at least the best that I have ever read.<br />Bloom seems particularly taken by the character of Hadji Murad, his heroic qualities, and by the<br />&quot;growth&quot; he displays over the course of the tale.

One of the great delights of returning, in adulthood, to the literature that enchanted us in childhood is<br />the discovery of the great themes and subtexts to which we were oblivious then but which are so<br />obvious now.  Mrs. Frisby is a perfect illustration of this phenomenon.  When you are young you are<br />captivated by the animal adventure tale and your easy identification with the lowly mice.<br />But read it now and you realize the Biblical antecedents of the story, how the rats of NIMH, like Man,<br />are given the gift of knowledge by their creators and how this awakens in them a sense of morality.<br />We recall that the rats have determined to go off and live on their own, but it's all too easy to forget,<br />or never to notice, that the reason for their decision is that they are determined not to live by stealing.<br />Seeing clearly this additional component, that the rats have become moral creatures, makes their<br />struggle even more heroic and adds a depth to the story that makes it easy to see why this novel has<br />endured and struck a chord with readers, young and old, for some thirty years now.

The idea is to take the seventeen pounds he almost accidentally won on a<br />horse race and to go visit Lower Binfield, the village in which he grew up and which holds so many<br />happy memories of youth and of a simpler England.  The story is set in 1938, the War approaching,<br />and George's thoughts continually drift back to the time before WWI :<br />  1913! My God! 1913! The stillness, the green water, the rushing of the weir! It'll never come<br />  again. I don't mean that 1913 will never come again. I mean the feeling inside you, the feeling of<br />  not being in a hurry and not being frightened, the feeling you've either had and don't need to be<br />  told about, or haven't had and won't ever have the chance to learn.<br />And so he decides to try and recapture that scene of his youth  :<br />  [I]t wasn't that I wanted to watch my navel.  I only wanted to get my nerve back before the bad<br />  times begin.  Because does anyone who isn't dead from the neck up doubt that there's a bad time<br />  coming ?  We don't even know what it'll be, and yet we know it's coming.  Perhaps a war, perhaps<br />  a slump--no knowing, except that it'll be something bad.  Wherever we're going, we're going<br />  downwards.  Into the grave, into the cesspool--no knowing.  And you can't face that kind of thing<br />  unless you've got the right feeling inside you.  There's something that's gone out of us in these<br />  twenty years since the war.  It's a kind of vital juice that we've squirted away until there's nothing<br />  left.  All this rushing to and fro!  Everlasting scramble for a bit of cash.  Everlasting din of buses,<br />  bombs, radios, telephone bells.  Nerves worn all to bits, empty places in our bones where the<br />  marrow out to be.<br />  I shoved my foot down on the accelerator.  The very thought of going back to Lower Binfield had<br />  done me good already.  You know the feeling I had.  Coming up for air!<br />But of course the village and the life he recalls are long since gone.<br />Orwell writes beautifully about the world that Lower Binfield represented and with great disdain of<br />the England that George currently occupies.  But his most devastating intuitions concern the world to<br />come.  In the book's signal moment, George has gone to a Left Book Club meeting with his wife to<br />hear an anti-Fascist speaker.  As the speaker drones on :<br />  I'd stopped listening to the actual lecture.  But there are more ways than one of listening.  I shut my<br />  eyes for a moment.  The effect was curious.  I seemed to see the fellow much better when I could<br />  only hear his voice.<br />  It was a voice that sounded as if it could go on for a fortnight without stopping.  It's a ghastly thing,<br />  really, to have a sort of human barrel-organ shooting propaganda at you by the hour.  The same<br />  thing over and over again.  Hate, hate, hate.  Let's all get together and have a good hate.  Over and<br />  over.  It gives you the feeling that something has got inside your skull and is hammering down on<br />  your brain.  But for a moment, with my eyes shut, I managed to turn the tables on him.  I got inside<br />  his skull.  It was a peculiar sensation.  For about a second I was inside him, you might almost say I<br />  was him.  At any rate, I felt what he was feeling.<br />  I saw the vision that he was seeing.  And it wasn't at all the kind of vision that can be talked about.<br />  What he's saying is merely that Hitler's after us and we must all get together and have a good hate.<br />  Doesn't go into details.  Leaves it all respectable.  But what he's seeingis something quite<br />  different.  It's a picture of himself smashing people's faces in with a spanner.  Fascist faces, of<br />  course.  I know that's what he was seeing.  It was what I saw myself for the second or two that I<br />  was inside him.  Smash! Right in the middle!  The bones cave in like an eggshell and what was a<br />  face a minute ago is just a great big blob of strawberry jam.  Smash!  There goes another!  That's<br />  what's in his mind, waking and sleeping, and the more he thinks of it the more he likes it.  And it's<br />  all O.K. because the smashed faces belong to Fascists.  You could hear all that in the tone of his<br />  voice.<br />There's much here that foreshadows 1984, from the idea of an organized event called a &quot;hate&quot; to the<br />image of the future consisting of smashing peoples' faces--recall the chilling line : &quot;If you want a<br />picture of the future imagine a boot stomping on a human face--forever.&quot;<br />The term &quot;Orwellian&quot; is thrown about fairly freely, to the point where it may have no fixed meaning.<br />If anything, folks probably consider it to refer to the concept of &quot;Big Brother&quot; or some authoritarian<br />force spying on us or oppressing us.  But the truly Orwellian moments occur not so much when these<br />external forces are brought to bear, but when we become their accomplices : when Winston Smith<br />denounces Julia, when the other animals help enforce the pigs rules at Animal Farm, and here, when<br />the theoretically benign anti-Fascist becomes a figure of terror himself.  This is Orwell's great insight,<br />hard earned in the crucible of the Spanish Civil War, that in the modern political world, where mere<br />political differences yield to hatred of the other, even those with the best intentions become monstrous,<br />their hatreds warping them until they are capable of horrific acts.<br />Without taking anything away from Animal Farm or 1984, Coming Up for Air is perhaps an even<br />more impressive novel.  First of all, it is a realist fiction--with all the restrictions which that<br />entails--not a fantasy. Second, where the other two books have the advantage of hindsight, Coming Up<br />for Air is predictive.  It correctly forecasts a world where even the Allies, the putative &quot;good guys,&quot;<br />would find themselves shipping citizens to concentration camps, fire bombing cities and finally<br />resorting to nuclear weapons.

But more importantly, Buckley demonstrated that <BR>there was a significant segment of the democratic Party that was just waiting to be wooed by a <BR>conservative Republican message.  These folks--largely middle or working class, White, ethnic and <BR>Catholic--would later form the backbone of Nixon's &quot;Silent Majority&quot; and would come to be called <BR>Reagan Democrats, but it was the 1965 New York mayoral race that really showed that conservatism <BR>had an inherent appeal to this population.

Mohsin<br />Hamid's Moth Smoke, set in Lahore, Pakistan in the summer of 1998, as India and Pakistan rattled<br />their nuclear sabers, offers a very readable entree to some of the issues surrounding the awkward<br />process of modernizing one Moslem nation.  In particular, it captures the frustration and anger of the<br />less fortunate in a country whose ruling class is thoroughly corrupt and where the economic divide is<br />so vast that the wealthy can insulate themselves from the rules that bind the rest of society, and can<br />nearly avoid physical contact with the lower classes.  But it also conveys some sense of the visceral<br />pride felt at every level of society when the government demonstrated that--just as the Christians, Jews,<br />Orthodox, Buddhists, and Hindus--Moslems have the bomb too.  This tension, of income inequalities<br />dividing the nation, while ethno-religious pride unites it, is currently a defining characteristic of the<br />region.<br />Set against this exotic backdrop of nuclear confrontation and a miasma of corruption, cronyism, and<br />kickbacks, Hamid unfolds an oddly familiar tale that's equal parts hard-boiled fiction and<br />yuppie-descent-into-drugs-and-alcohol : the debts to Jay McInerney and James M. Cain are equally<br />heavy.  Darashikoh &quot;Daru&quot; Shezad is a young banker who grew up on the fringes of high society, but<br />whose lack of connections has ultimately brought him up against a glass ceiling.  Of course, his<br />increasing predilection for booze and dope hasn't helped matters any; and when he tells off an<br />important client, the bank fires him.  Meanwhile, his more fortunate, because better connected,<br />childhood friend, Aurangzeb &quot;Ozi&quot; Shah, has just returned to Pakistan from the States, with his lovely<br />wife, Mumtaz, and toddler son, Muazzam.  At first joyfully reunited, the old friends are soon pushed<br />apart again, first by Daru's declining social circumstances, then by a horrific instance of Ozi's<br />immunity from justice, and finally by the attraction that develops between Daru and Mumtaz.<br />The title of the book refers to what remains when the moth is seduced by the candle flame, but it's also<br />a metaphor for Daru spiraling towards his own destruction, drawn by the allure of sex and drugs and<br />easy money.  What makes the novel particularly appealing is that we feel right at home within this<br />comforting structure of genre, but are simultaneously dazzled by glimpses into an utterly alien culture.<br />Thus, a story we've heard a hundred times before comes across as somehow fresh and surprising.<br />First time novelist Mohsin Hamid actually grew up in Lahore, then attended Princeton and Harvard<br />Law, and now works in Manhattan.  His familiarity with the very different cultures of America and<br />Pakistan makes him an excellent guide for Western readers.  It's hard to imagine a more accessible and<br />enjoyable, though fatalistic, novel if you are looking to literature as a way to start exploring the issues<br />confronting the nation states of the Islamic world.<br />GRADE : Alovely <BR>wife, Mumtaz, and toddler son, Muazzam.

Kathleen de Burca, a travel writer, has fled an unhappy childhood in her native Ireland, only to find an unhappy adulthood in England.  She has almost no friends and seems never to have loved or been loved.  Instead she engages in innumerable casual couplings, fueled by nothing but physical desire :<br />  I believed in passion the way other people believed in God: everything fell in place around it.<br />But now, as she approaches fifty, she faces the possibility that even this sexual consolation will dry up :<br /><br />  But then I thought, Isn't it some kind<br />  of good, that a person can be shocked into truthfulness, even if it's only for a<br />  few hours and only with herself?

Passion. I murmured<br />  the word half out loud. What passion? It was never real excitement that got you<br />  into bed; it was hope, like some stubborn underground weed. Look at the way<br />  you've believed every time, at the first brush of a hand across a breast, that the<br />  roof over your life was sliding back and a dazzling, starry firmament was just<br />  coming into view. When it never happened. When a one-night stand has never,<br />  in all the years, done what you wanted it to do. What's more, the whole thing is<br />  getting more and more pathetic. The truth is, I said to myself, that the older you<br />  get, the more grateful you are for being wanted on any terms, by anybody.<br />  But if I stopped all that, how would I ever meet anyone? If I didn't have this<br />  kind of sex life, I'd have none! Then I thought, But should it even be called sex?<br />  Look at the businessman in Harare.

But things go no better there as she squabbles with sisters, gets involved with a married man, and rages against the country's anti-abortion laws.  Apparently, the lot of Ireland's universally unhappy women would be infinitely better if only they could terminate their unwanted pregnancies.  In fact, it's not merely the children who are wrecking their lives, I lost track of how many women in the book have some kind of disease of the womb; their very womanhood is killing them.  A whole lot of other nonsense goes on, but by then I plunged deep into a suicidal fugue state...<br />Lest you think I'm overstating the case here, allow me to submit in my defense this quote from a profile of O'Faolain in The Guardian :<br />  'I can't wait to be an old lady,' she says.

Stanley Yelnats is a boy who is being punished as a result of the gypsy curse laid on his<br />&quot;no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.&quot;  He's sent to Camp Green Lake for<br />stealing a pair of sneakers, though he claims they actually fell at his feet from out of the sky.  Stanley<br />is innocent enough to think that Camp will be interesting, but soon finds himself digging five by five<br />foot holes in a blazing sun.

But where Princess Bride drew on everything from Pirate movies to<br />Sword and Sorcery pulps, and followed conventional heroic adventure format, Sachar's plot is drawn<br />more from American tall tales, like Pecos Bill, and, strangely enough for a children's book, such<br />movies as Cool Hand Luke and such existentialist dilemmas as The Myth of Sisyphus.  Fate and doom<br />seem to loom over the Yelnats family generally and Stanley in particular, though by story's end justice<br />has been meted out, rather suddenly, to all concerned.<br />The reviews I've read have been uniformly favorable, even ecstatic, with many reviewers suggesting<br />that even adults will enjoy the book.  But I didn't like it all that much.  If there's anything sillier than<br />the idea that existence consists of mere drudgery (Existentialism) it would be that the drudgery is<br />followed, arbitrarily, by a balancing of the cosmic scales.  Personally, I find the view that life is<br />absurd to be morally corrosive and I'd just as soon not have my kids fall prey to such beliefs.

An elderly man reads to an elderly woman every day from an aged notebook that he carries around with him.  Within its pages is told the story of Noah Taylor Calhoun, a young Southerner, and of his great teenage passion for Allison Nelson.  Alas, their affair came a cropper because she was of higher social station then him.  But in the intervening years, during which he has sought his fortune in the North and fought in WWII, both have been unable to completely commit their hearts to others, because of the bond that still exists between them.  But now, as she is about to marry an upper crust lawyer, Allison journeys to Noah's farm, where he has essentially secluded himself, to see what remains of the desire they once shared.<br />Well, guess what ?  A fair bit remains.  And as the newly reunited lovers reminisce and feel out the situation, so to speak, Allison's mother and her fianc&eacute; come rushing into town to see just what she's getting herself into.  Will Allison choose Noah or the lawyer, and which one is the old man who's reading her the notebook ?<br />For one incredibly brief moment, I actually entertained the idea that Nicholas Sparks was going to throw us a curve and that it would turn out that the lawyer and Allison had shared fifty years of loving marriage, such that he remained so devoted that he could even read to her about these painful memories, that the message of the book would be that passion is all well and good, and exciting enough when you are young and stupid, but that it is a transitory and relatively meaningless thing, while love endures, and genuine love lasts for a lifetime.  There's even a line that raises the possibility, when Allison acknowledges to herself that she doesn't actually love Noah, but is instead in love with the youthful lust they once had for one another.  But Sparks tips his hand when she recalls the words her mother used to get her to break off with Noah all those years ago :<br />  [S]ometimes, our future is dictated by what we are, as opposed to what we want.<br />Clearly this sentiment is intended to be abhorrent to us.  Contrast it with the admonition she receives from Noah :<br />  You can't live your life for other people.  You've got to do what's right for you, even if it hurts<br />  some people you love.<br />Ah, such is the monstrously selfish ethos of the romantic : we each only have one great love; it's rarely the person we're with at the moment; but when the \\"right\\" person comes along, all boorish behavior on our parts is to be excused; seize the moment--the consequences be damned; gimme, gimme, gimme, I want, I want...<br /><br />GRADE : Dr used to get her to break off with Noah all those years ago : <br />    [S]ometimes, our future is dictated by what we are, as opposed to what we want. <br />Clearly this sentiment is intended to be abhorrent to us.

His quest requires him to minimize Nixon's truly reprehensible behavior as President.  Instead, it indicts them.  To his credit, Wicker does acknowledge that the growing centralization of power in the hands of the Federal government created a situation in which corruption was inevitable.<br />Meanwhile, Wicker also betrays rather extensive squeamishness about some of the particulars of Nixon's foreign policy.  He argues that Nixon should have gotten out of Vietnam much quicker, should have ditched the Shah of Iran and shouldn't have tilted towards Pakistan during its dispute with India.  He bemoans our involvement in the toppling of Salvador Allende in Chile.  And he thinks the pace of negotiation with the Soviets should have been quicker.  The general case here seems to be that Nixon was okay on the big stuff, thawing out the Cold War, but not quite good enough.  That's fairly timid criticism.<br />It is only on domestic policy that Wicker is completely enamored.  He goes so far as to adopt Daniel Patrick Moynihan's assessment that the Nixon Administration was \\"'the most progressive' of the postwar era.\\"  In particular, he likes the way that Nixon used his powers to desegregate Southern schools.<br />In the end, the quality that Wicker seems to admire most in Nixon is, appropriately enough, the same one that people admire in Bill Clinton : the awesome capacity to sustain political damage and live to fight another day.<br />where Wicker tries to psychoanalyze Nixon, particularly his paranoia and his willingness to cut ethical corners.  Since the book is really more of an essay than a biography, this exercise might have had some limited value had Wicker discussed why it was that people of his ilk, Eastern journalists, had such a hard time loving Nixon.  The mere suppositions about the demons that drove Nixon don't have much value on their own.  Wicker is absolutely correct, though it's hard to believe he's thought out the implications, that the sheer size and inordinate power of the Cold War presidency and government made corruption and scandal inevitable.k, Eastern journalists, had such a hard time loving Nixon.

This basic promise was finally and fully embraced during the 1960's with Women's Liberation, the Sexual Revolution, the rise of the Drug Culture, the rejection of the nuclear family, etc., etc., etc..  All of these different waves of social experimentation had a one thing in common, each was premised on the idea that individual freedom is the paramount value, more important than any responsibility owed to our fellow men.  Together they elevate the self above neighborhood, community, society and family.  They place the individual at the of his own universe, whole and sufficient unto himself, beholden to no one, dependent on no one.<br />Joan Didion's novel, Play It As It Lays, though written in 1970, already recognized the horrific consequences of this monstrous ideology of selfishness.  The main character in the novel, Maria Wyeth, is a thirty-one year old model turned actress.  Her days are filled with casual sex, drugs, alcohol, aimless wanderings, and meaningless conversations with people she doesn't much like.  Her marriage is falling apart.  Her four year old daughter has been institutionalized, because of some form of chemical imbalance.  Pregnant again, she gets an abortion, an illegal one performed in a safe house in Encino.  This accelerates her slide into an emotional instability so severe that she ends up confined to a mental hospital.<br />Though she mentions an inchoate longing to return to her childhood several times, in her final monologues in the book she seems to have settled into complete nihilism :<br />  I used to ask questions, and I got the answer: nothing.  The answer is 'nothing.'<br />And her behavior--the sex with friends, acquaintances and strangers, the barbiturates and alcohol, the almost complete absence of emotion with which she accepts a friend's decision to commit suicide--certainly suggests that nothing matters.  However, there is one moment in the book which betrays a hidden truth; after an assignation with a married lover, the following conversation ensues :<br />  'Don't cry,' he said.<br />  'There's no point.'<br />  'No point in what.'<br />  'No point in our doing any of those things.'<br />  He looked at her for a long while.  'Later,' he said then.<br />  'I'm sorry.'<br />  'It's all right.'<br />  On the drive back they told each other that it had been the wrong time, the wrong place, that it was<br />  bad because he had lied to arrange it, that it would be all right another time, idyllic later.  He<br />  mentioned the strain he had been under, he mentioned the preview had gone badly.  She mentioned<br />  that she was getting the curse.  They mentioned Kate, Carter, Felicia, the weather, Oxnard, his<br />  dislike of motel rooms,  her fear of subterfuge.  They mentioned everything but one thing: that she<br />  had left the point in a bedroom in Encino.<br />Significantly, this comes in a portion of the book that is not told in Maria's first person voice.  It would seem to be the author's judgment upon Maria and her cohorts.  The freedom they have bought into has brought them entirely empty and miserable lives, while leaving them incapable of understanding that certain things in life actually do mean something.  Maria's life had a point, the life that she was carrying and towards which she had a responsibility.  It was the abdication of this burden, the failure to accept responsibility for another being, which has rendered her life finally meaningless.<br />This is a bleak and devastating look at a culture where people have become completely atomized, heedless of anyone beyond themselves and, therefore, so soulless that there's not much to like about themselves.  In fact, none of the characters are likable and, other than that brief authorial comment, there's not much of a redeeming vision to be found.  I kind of admired the book's very savagery, but it was ultimately just so dark and hopeless that it was hard to enjoy.<br />GRADE : Blikable and, other than that brief authorial comment, there's not much of a redeeming vision to be found.

Whether he's writing about a Cristo art project (Umbrellas) or The Rocky Horror Picture Show (Twenty Years Too Late to See The Rocky Horror...), he uncovers the amazing in the mundane.  Several have a pretty sharp edge to them, like Prayer for the Man Who Mugged My Father, 72--suffice it to say, the mugger hopes the prayer doesn't come to pass.  And a couple are just really funny, like Broken Toe, where the title occurrence at least snaps him out of his middle aged complacency.

From this beginning/ending in an American city, the doppleganger (&quot;the soul he should have had&quot;) observes the progression/regression of Friendly's life, which takes them back to New York City, where he was known as John Young, to Portugal and Italy (Hamilton de Souza), to Germany (Odilo Unverdorben) and to Auschwitz, where Unverdorben worked under Mengele, performing horrific experiments on the inmates.<br />It is at Auschwitz that we see just what Amis has intended, as, rather than a mass murderer, Unverdorben appears to be a healer, his experiments, run backwards, seeming to bring his &quot;patients&quot; back to life and health, the camp filling with people &quot;as good as new&quot;, the Zyklon B repackaged, the ghettos dismantled, the Jewish Laws repealed, the windows unshattered on Kristalnacht, the entire Holocaust itself being undone.  And back and back until Unverdorben is unborn, crawling back into his mother, as if none of it had ever happened, a kind of cosmic do-over.<br />Martin Amis has variously said that either the Holocaust is the central fact of modern life or that the &quot;nuclear experience&quot; was :<br />  Nuclear war never happened, but this was the nuclear experience, unknowable to anyone born too<br />  soon or too late. In order to know what it was, you have to have been a schoolchild, crouched under<br />  your desk, hoping it would protect you from the end of the world.<br />And, indeed, his response to these two facts seems to be to want to hide under a desk or, as in Time's Arrow, to crawl back into the womb.  Actually, this is his reaction to the general tendency towards entropy in all of existence.  He seems terrified of disorder, longing for a return to the perfectly ordered world that existed before Adam and Eve ate of the apple.<br />The problem with this yearning for security is that it is ultimately antihuman.  The Holocaust, the prospect of nuclear war, all of the evils that we commit or of which we are capable, are all part and parcel of what it is to be human.  Terrible as they are to contemplate, they are facts which we, as a species, must come to terms with if we are ever to overcome this capacity for evil.  In this sense, Time's Arrow is representative of a literature of defeat.  The security that Amis is in search of could only come at the expense of Man's free will.  Many would find this a price worth paying, and since at least the time of Cain and Abel, humanity has divided into two camps over whether to pay it, but it would basically reduce us to the status of sheep.  This prospect, of permanently surrendering our humanity, is surely more frightening than the knowledge that we are frequently susceptible to actions which are inhuman, more frightening even when that inhumanity occurs on such a horrificscale as did the Holocaust.<br />Some critics have credited Amis with enhancing our understanding of the Holocaust by approaching it from a novel perspective, and it is always worthwhile to do so.  But  the time reversal technique is not compelling enough to carry the story along for all of its hundreds of pages.  This is the type of clever trick that the Twilight Zone used to toss off in a half hour.  This might have been an effective short story, but it's a rather tedious novel.<br />GRADE : Cs on such a horrific scale as did the Holocaust. <br />Some critics have credited Amis with enhancing our understanding of the Holocaust by approaching it from a novel perspective, and it is always worthwhile to do so.

Tragedy or farce?<br />  -Wild Thorns<br />This novel is part of something called the Emerging Voices Series and, from what I could find online,<br />although the book is now over twenty-five years old and Sahar Khalifeh is in her fifties, she is indeed<br />considered one of the important voices in Middle Eastern literature.  The action of Wild Thorns takes<br />place just a few years after Israel occupied the West Bank, which is where Khalifeh lived when she<br />wrote it.  The main character in the book is Usama, a young Palestinian returning to the territories<br />after being fired from his job in the oil states.  Though his mother has high hopes that he will marry a<br />lovely cousin, Usama has actually returned to his homeland on a mission, to blow up the buses which<br />carry Palestinian day laborers to their jobs in Israel.<br />Usama is shocked by the changes he finds on his return, the indignities that people put up with,<br />starting with the difficulty getting through the check points on the way into the territories, having to<br />submit to searches and interrogations.  But he is most disturbed by how economically dependent<br />Palestinians have become on Israel, both for jobs and for consumer goods.  He sees this as a kind of<br />collaboration, which implicates everyone in the occupation.<br />Meanwhile, the hero of the book is really Adil, another young Palestinian, Usama's cousin, who has<br />stayed at home, works at one of the well paying Israeli jobs in order to take care of his extended<br />family, and wants no part of the coming violence.  But, inevitably, he too gets caught up in the sweep<br />of events.  In the first instance, when he just happens to be on the scene when an Israeli soldier is<br />attacked and stabbed, Adil carries the soldier's young daughter to safety.  But in the end, when Usama<br />and his cronies attack the very bus convoy that Adil is riding in, he ends up grabbing a gun himself.<br />Though Ms Khalifeh is obviously sympathetic to the plight of her people, the novel is largely<br />non-polemical.  Adil seems to be as much a victim of Usama's mindless terrorism as is the Israeli<br />soldier.  Yet, Adil's final decision to take up arms makes a certain awful sense too.  Even someone as<br />generally hostile to the Palestinian cause as I am can understand how even the most decent and<br />reluctant of men would choose to fight with his own people when push came to shove.  But, of course,<br />this is the evil logic of terror, to make everyone take sides, to turn even the peace loving into killers.<br />It is this that makes the events of the novel as tragic as they are inexorable.himself.<br />Though Ms Khalifeh is obviously sympathetic to the plight of her people, the novel is largely <BR>non-polemical.

He is<br />  usually an aristocrat, intelligent, well-educated, and informed by idealism and goodwill but<br />  incapable, for reasons as complex as Hamlet's, of engaging in effective action.<br />  -Encyclopaedia Britannica<br />In his great autobiography, Memoirs of a Superfluous Man, Albert Jay Nock meant that he was<br />superfluous because his ideas, particularly his belief in freedom, had become so outmoded at the time<br />he was writing--the 1940s.  But the original superfluous men were Russian nobles, who led utterly<br />meaningless lives of leisure, while peasants worked their land, servants took care of them, and<br />autocratic government mostly ignored them.  They were felt to be superfluous because they had so<br />little to do and made so little contribution to Russian culture.  For the most part though, they were<br />treated, in literature anyway, as kind of tragic heroes, as Russian Hamlets.<br />Thus, in Ivan Turgenev's novella, The Diary of a Superfluous Man, the young protagonist,<br />Tchulkaturin, humiliates himself in a romantic entanglement and a resulting duel, all the while<br />conveying the sense that there's nothing else really left for him to do with himself.  Turgenev's<br />portrayal of this hopeless character combines tragicomedy with social criticism, but it is certainly more<br />sympathetic than not.<br />As always, Turgenev is the most accessible of Russian authors; the Constance Garnett translation is<br />very readable; and it is blessedly short.  Even if you're, understandably, intimidated by Russian<br />novelists, you'll enjoy it.<br />GRADE : B+	2001-09-27

Now she has to win the<br />acceptance of her schoolmates, while still honoring her Chinese heritage.  This dichotomy is reflected<br />in the title of the book, as it is the Year of the Boar on the Chinese calendar, but in Brooklyn, it is<br />Jackie Robinson's rookie year.  Over the course of the baseball season Shirley becomes a devoted fan<br />of the game and of Robinson, and his trail blazing integration of the game becomes a metaphor for<br />Shirley's efforts to fit in to a new society.<br />The book is delightful, with a brave and likable heroine who will appeal to anyone, but particularly<br />girls, and the baseball theme should intrigue boys. It should  foster in all kids a further interest in<br />Jackie Robinson,  a genuine American hero.  Best of all, it offers a moving depiction of the immigrant<br />experience and strikes just the right balance between the value of assimilation and immersion in<br />American culture, while maintaining respect for one's native traditions.<br />Lord's America really is a land of opportunity, but one which places obligations on those who wish to<br />reap them.  In turn, the example of Jackie Robinson stands as a reminder that to fulfill its promise,<br />America must afford these opportunities to all those who are willing to shoulder these responsibilities,<br />regardless of race, creed, or color (or gender).<br />GRADE : B+	2001-09-25

It's a simple metaphor.<br />  -Michel Houellebecq<br />What could be sadder than someone who understands the greatest problem of modernity but has<br />surrendered to it, rather than struggle against it ?  The novelist Michel Houellebecq is the most<br />controversial and reviled Frenchman of the day--and just think what it must take to achieve that rare<br />distinction :  the most hated man in France (actually, he's even fled now, to Ireland).  He was widely<br />hailed on the publication of this novel, which was famously compared to The Stranger of Albert<br />Camus by many, including the critic Tibor Fischer, who is blurbed on the cover of the book.  But<br />then his next novel, published here as Elementary Particles, attacked the French student<br />revolutionaries of 1968, indicting them for their hedonistic individualism and the exalting of the<br />pursuit of personal gratification, which he writes has effectively drained sex of any passion or love.<br />Such things simply aren't done in France; the Generation of '68, like the perpetrators of the original<br />French Revolution, are sacrosanct, are beyond criticism.<br />Not content to merely rile up the intelligentsia, Houellebecq's new book, Plateforme, attacks Islam<br />and celebrates sexual tourism, trips to Southeast Asia for the purpose of having sex with teenage<br />prostitutes.  The advocacy of using the Third World as a brothel upsets people for all the obvious<br />reasons.  But his comments on Islam may earn him his own fatwa.<br />The girlfriend of the novel's protagonist is murdered in a terrorist bombing, prompting this passage :<br />  Islam had shattered my life, and Islam was certainly something I could hate. In the days that<br />  followed, I dedicated myself to hating Islam.  Each time that I hear that a Palestinian terrorist, or a<br />  Palestinian child, or a pregnant Palestinian woman has been shot in the Gaza Strip, I shiver with<br />  enthusiasm at the thought that there is one less Muslim<br />Before September 11th such thoughts were truly beyond the pale, particularly in a nation, France,<br />which in a matter of decades will be majority Muslim.<br />In subsequent interviews, Mr. Houellebecq, possibly quite accurately, suggested that Islam is doomed<br />because capitalism is undermining it.  A thought which reflects greater understanding of the roots of<br />fundamentalist terrorism than many of his more politically correct critics, but which is likewise not to<br />be discussed in polite company.<br />At any rate, in Whatever, a geeky young French computer technician, the job Houellebecq held when<br />he was writing it, who has not had sex in two years, is sent to Rouen with a partner, Tisserand, who is<br />even nerdier and a virgin to boot.  The narrator resents a world in which he is unable to satisfy his<br />desires because :<br />  In a perfectly liberal economic system, some people accumulate considerable fortunes; others<br />  molder in unemployment and poverty. In a perfectly liberal sexual system, some people have a<br />  varied and exciting erotic life; others are reduced to masturbation and solitude.<br />So he tries to stoke Tisserand's own resentments enough to turn him into a serial killer (the one<br />murder of The Stranger apparently no longer sufficing).<br />Houellebecq's critique of modern man's isolation from his fellows is certainly accurate.  However,<br />once you've diagnosed the pathology you can't just surrender to it.  Further cheapening sex and adding<br />violence to it can only degrade mankind further.  Having recognized our condition, and that it is<br />critical, it is incumbent on all of us to restore the connections that once bound us together, to rebuild<br />community, rather than to retreat further into the self.<br />Here's an excerpt from a profile of the author, by Emily Eakin, that ran in the New York Times<br />Magazine :<br />  Initially, Houellebecq set out to change the world. ... Houellebecq believed the book [Whatever]<br />  would force people to reconsider the premium we place on physical beauty. 'I was certain the<br />  novel would provoke social change,' he said. 'Now I think it was megalomania. When you go into a<br />  club today, you see the same behaviour as six years ago. A novel won't ever change the world.'<br />Is that really all that remains for Houellebecq, to try and get his hood waxed, and to help other<br />unattractive men to get it on too ?  If so, isn't he part of the problem, rather than part of the solution<br />?  When your doctor tells you that you're developing skin cancer, he doesn't recommend that you go<br />sit in the sun, does he ?<br />At one point, the narrator sees a graffito that says :<br />  God wanted there to be inequality, not injustice.<br />This smacks of the truth.  A world in which an unattractive, and by all accounts extremely unpleasant,<br />Frenchman does not have his choice of woman, while unfortunate for him, is probably inevitable.<br />But a world in which we are all mere particles, colliding randomly but never connecting, is a tragedy<br />for all of us.<br />The book then is most interesting as a self-portrait of a defeated victim of modernity's increasing<br />atomization (Atomisation was actually the British title of Elementary Particles).  But, because he ends<br />up collaborating in the process, he is too much a willing victim for us to feel any real sympathy for<br />his plight.

A truly modern Turkey governed by the rule of law would raise the Turkish people to levels of<br />  prosperity and self-confidence they have never known before.  Despite the country's political and<br />  psychological underdevelopment, it has the resources to become a towering power.  If it can<br />liberate<br />  itself from its paralyzing fears and embrace true democracy, it will also serve as a magnetic<br />  example of how the ideals of liberty can triumph over enormous obstacles.  By adding moral<br />  strength to its military strength, Turkey could become a dominant force in the Middle East,<br />  encouraging peace and pulling Arab countries away from the social backwardness and feudal<br />  dictatorship under which most of them now suffer.  It could exert a mighty and stabilizing<br />  influence westward to the Balkans and eastward to the Caucasus and Central Asia, becoming the<br />  key power in a region that is strategically vital, overwhelmingly rich in oil and other resources, and<br />  now ruled mostly by tyrants who are dragging it toward chaos.<br />  -Stephen Kinzer, Crescent &amp; Star<br />Though we pay obscenely little attention, Turkey is an extraordinarily important nation and its future<br />may go a long way to determining whether Islam and democracy can ultimately co-exist in one<br />nation.  Geographically and politically, Turkey occupies a unique position, squeezed between Europe<br />to the West and the Islamic world to the East.  Though traditionally Muslim, its great revolutionary<br />leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, upon taking power in 1922 and establishing a Republic, reoriented the<br />nation towards the West, toward the values of the Enlightenment and the institutions of secular<br />democracy.  But still today, despite the continuing devotion of Turks to the person and ideas of<br />Ataturk, it remains an open question as to whether the democracy can endure.<br />Stephen Kinzer was the NY Times correspondent in Turkey for four event filled years and his passion<br />for the country and its people is infectious.  In conversational but admonitory style he manages both<br />to educate Westerners as to the history and cultural richness of Turkey while also honestly depicting<br />its internal problems, many of them unresolved, and firmly prodding Turks to deal with them, as a<br />great nation must.<br />One very effective device Kinzer uses is a series of brief interludes each dealing with one element of<br />Turkish life.  These include  : the fez; raki, the national drink; the nargile, or water pipe; the nation's<br />three favorite sports--camel fighting, oil wrestling, and cirit (a form of jousting); the literature of<br />Nazim Hikmet; and the romantic endeavor of swimming the Bosphorus.  These quick chapters provide<br />a rich and fascinating texture to go along with the history.<br />The hero of the story is very much Ataturk, who at least in Kinzer's portrait seems to have been one<br />of the most remarkable national leaders of the 20th Century.  Like Peter the Great in Russia and the<br />Shah in Iran, which not coincidentally are the two other equally troublesome Eurasian democracies,<br />he found it intolerable that his people should be so far behind the West in terms of technology, wealth<br />creation and self governance, and so, using dictatorial means, he imposed Western institutions an an<br />often reluctant populace and tried eliminating persistent vestiges of the Ottoman past.  That the<br />Republic endures, is allied with NATO, has a strategic partnership with Israel, and is on the verge of<br />entering the EU is testimony to his success.  But the too frequent necessity for the armed forces to step<br />in and depose governments, the oppression of the Kurd minority, and the very real fear of a takeover<br />of government by radical Islamicists, illustrates just how tenuous the democracy remains.<br />Kinzer is extremely optimistic about Turkey's future and feelsthat it can afford to face its past more<br />honestly than it has--including such issues as the Kurds, Cyprus, and the Armenian massacre--and can<br />take the risk of loosening the Kemalist grip on society, the military backed determination of Turkey's<br />elites that no threat to Kemal Ataturk's legacy will be permitted.  I certainly hope that he is right,<br />though I'm not as confident.<br />Even as this book hits the stores, Turkey has decided to allow the United States to operate out of<br />Turkish airbases in the war on terrorism.  Once again, Turkey is proving itself to be a far more<br />important ally than we in the West give it credit for.  Hopefully Stephen Kinzer's excellent book will<br />educate many Americans as to the unique and potentially vital role in world affairs that Turkey, with<br />its uneasy blend of democracy and Islam, may play in the coming decades.

This is the awful truth that Rainer Maria Rilke's semi autobiographical hero,<br />Malte Laurids Brigge, seems to be trying to evade.  In fact, this is very much the dilemma of modern<br />man, for no matter how much we love God, our love will not necessarily influence Him, but His love<br />for us places us under an obligation to Him.  Of course, the easiest way out of this dilemma is simply<br />to deny the existence of God, which has been the response of Modernity.<br />Unfortunately, this still leaves the problem of fellow humans, and the obligations that their love puts<br />us under.  Thus, Rilke, who wrote the book after running away from his wife and young child, says of<br />Brigge :<br />  [H]e had decided never to love, in order not to put anyone in the terrible position of being loved.<br />Or, as Sartre more famously said :<br />  Hell is other people.<br />Both quotes reflect an understanding that love ultimately places limits on human freedom, by creating<br />interdependence.<br />Brigge's/Rilke's reaction, one which has been all to common in our age, was to turn completely<br />inward and become totally self-absorbed, to disregard others.  And in the absence of God and of other<br />people what is the central fact of the self ?  Mortality.  So it is little surprise that an obsession with<br />death thoroughly permeates the Notebooks.  If you really want to read about an effete and morbidly<br />self-centered intellectual who is down and out in Paris (of course Paris), this is the book for you.<br />But if you don't share in the pathologies, it's likely to be off-putting, at least it was for me.  [The beauty of Rilke's language]<br />certainly does not redeem the depressing story.  Rilke's concerns are those you would expect of the<br />man that Michael Dirda describes above : only his own unpleasant self.  In the end the book is mainly<br />interesting as an influential expression of a philosophy of mere existence that has proven enormously<br />damaging, contributing mightily to the unfortunate atomization of humanity in the 20th Century.<br />GRADE : Dok is mainly <BR>interesting as an influential expression of a philosophy of mere existence that has proven enormously <BR>damaging, contributing mightily to the unfortunate atomization of humanity in the 20th Century.<br />GRADE : D	2001-09-22

And how come no one knows this? How come no<br />  one does anything about it?<br />  -Stewart O'Nan, The Lost World of Richard Yates (Boston Review)<br />Well, as it turns out, O'Nan did do something about.  His essay, and similar proselytizing by Richard<br />Russo, got Yates back into print and earned the recent release of his Collected Stories genuine big<br />event status, with reviews and reappraisals in all the leading papers and journals.  For now at least,<br />he's been rediscovered and restored to an exalted position.  But if you read The Easter Parade, it's easy<br />to see why he faded away so fast; this isn't the kind of book that the intelligentsia would want people<br />reading, nor would they care to continue to face its ugly truths themselves.<br />In one of the most depressing opening lines you'd ever want to read, Yates let's the reader know<br />exactly what he's in for, and why :<br />  Neither of the Grimes sisters would have a happy life, and looking back it always seemed that the<br />  trouble began with their parents' divorce.<br />The promise of the 60s was that the abandonment of traditional morality, family structures, traditions,<br />and beliefs would have a liberating effect and make all our lives better.  But Yates proceeds instead to<br />show just how catastrophic these changes were.  The older Grimes sister, Sarah, marries a man who<br />looks like Laurence Olivier, and despite an outwardly happy and comfortable life, ends up being<br />battered as they teeter on the brink of financial ruin.<br />Younger sister Emily becomes little more than a slattern, scrumping in parks and waking with<br />strangers, though she does have a couple of longer term relationships.<br />The troubles of both can be traced directly to the divorce of their parents.  When Emily finds out that<br />her sister is being beaten by her husband, Sarah tells her :<br />  It's a marriage.  If you want to stay married you learn to put up with things.<br />Emily's prototypical affair is with Ted Banks :<br />  ...both felt an urge to drink too much when they were together, as if they didn't want to touch each<br />  other sober.<br />The one sister is so desperate to hold her marriage together that she'll endure anything.  The other is<br />so afraid of being rejected that she has to have serial relationships and to erect a haze of booze<br />between herself and her men.<br />The story is, in fact, soaked in alcohol.  And it becomes clear that people use drink to avoid their real<br />selves, each other, and genuine interaction.  It turns out that the &quot;freedom&quot; they've theoretically<br />gained has made them miserable, is even killing them.<br />Towards the end of the novel, after Sarah has apparently, though not officially, been killed by her<br />husband, one of her sons tells Emily :<br />  'You know something? I've always admired you, Aunt Emmy.  My mother used to say &quot;Emmy's a<br />  free spirit.&quot;  I didn't know what that meant when I was little, so I asked her once.  And she said<br />  &quot;Emmy doesn't care what anybody thinks.  She's her own person and she goes her own way.&quot;<br />  The walls of Emily's throat closed up.

On the one hand, first time novelist Glen David Gold has done<br />a really extraordinary job of rendering what the world of the great stage illusionists might have been<br />like, from the true life hero of the book, Charles Carter, to Houdini and Thurston.  The magic shows<br />are far and away the best part of the book, making the reader desperately wish he were witnessing the<br />actual tricks.  But for my money, he doesn't do much with either Carter, who is so uniformly decent<br />and naive as to deflect our interest, or the magical arts.<br />The main drama of the story is supposed to come from Carter's possible involvement in the death of<br />President Warren G. Harding, who the book has attend a Carter show and participate in one of his<br />greatest illusions, just hours before his death.  Now, largely thanks to Paul Johnson's generous portrait<br />of him in the great book Modern Times, I'm more of a fan of the generally reviled Harding than most<br />folks are likely to be....<br />So I guess I'd recommend the book, if for no other reason than the fascination of reading about the old<br />vaudeville shows and the great magicians.  But, I have to say, after nearly 500 pages, it was a great<br />relief to finally reach the end of the book.<br />One word of warning : if you don't want to read the book, don't even look at it.  The cover, a<br />reproduction of a genuine poster, is positively mesmerizing.<br />GRADE : C+	2001-09-19

B. White, November 1929<br />As the poem Natural History, written some 23 years before Charlotte's Web indicates, EB White had a long fascination with spiders and their webs and the truth to be discerned in them.  In fact, he was enamored of the natural world in general and his desire to be closer to the land led him to move to a Maine farm in 1939.  It was in the farm life and specifically in the comfort of the barn that the inspiration for this children's classic came to him :<br />  As for Charlotte's Web, I like animals and my barn is a very pleasant place to be, at all hours. One<br />  day when I was on my way to feed the pig, I began feeling sorry for the pig because, like most<br />  pigs, he was doomed to die. This made me sad. So I started thinking of ways to save a pig's life. I<br />  had been watching a big grey spider at her work and was impressed by how clever she was at<br />  weaving. Gradually I worked the spider into the story that you know, a story of friendship and<br />  salvation on a farm.<br />From these humble beginnings he wove an enduring tale of love and loyalty, life and death, and, perhaps unnoticed by most of us until adulthood, of the comic ingenuousness of man, and of the value of knowledge and a big vocabulary.<br />White, renowned as an essayist, wrote so clearly and fluidly that the pages whiz by.  And if you get a chance to listen to the audio version that he reads himself, it is the performance of a master storyteller.  Though a native New Yorker (Mt. Vernon anyway), White had by then picked up the rhythm and accents of a New Englander.  In addition, he tells the story with apparent affection for his creations, love of the barnyard, and amusement at the goings on.<br />I was trying to figure out what made it all so magical and then I found this quote in which he described his own work (What Am I Saying To My Readers He ?, May 14, 1961, NY Times) :<br />  What am I saying to my readers? Well, I never know. Writing to me is not an exercise in addressing<br />  readers, it is more as though I were talking to myself while shaving. My foray into the field of<br />  children's literature was an accident, and although I do not mean to suggest that I spun my two<br />  yarns in perfect innocence and that I did not set about writing &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; deliberately,<br />  nevertheless, the thing started innocently enough, and I kept on because I found it was fun. It also<br />  became rewarding in other ways--and that was a surprise, as I am not essentially a storyteller and<br />  was taking a holiday from my regular work.<br />  All that I ever hope to say in books is that I love the world.

In this book she tries to do exactly what she describes above, take individual words that she found, and many others still find, off putting from the Biblical and Christian lexicons and reconcile herself to their meanings, however harsh or judgmental or intimidating they may seem.<br />She does this in a series of very brief essays--about 80 in less than four hundred pages--covering such words as : Dogma, Heresy, and Pentecostal.  Between the number of topics she covers and the very personal reflections they provoke, no one will agree with everything she has to say, and many will disagree with most of it.  But she brings two extremely important qualities to the task : humility and skepticism.<br />....<br />People of faith are commonly caricatured as people whose minds are closed to all but their own beliefs.

I first saw<br />the book in a discount bin, spine out, and wondered how come I'd never heard of the Nairobi Trio.<br />Intrigued enough to at least check it out, I was greeted by one of the most frightening images I've ever<br />seen on a book jacket : a derby wearing, cigar smoking, guy in a gorilla mask, the whole thing tinted<br />blue.  Check out the author info on the back flap and there's a picture of a long-haired guy in a top hat<br />who looks like a cross between Stevie Ray Vaughn and the actor David Warner.  The book is<br />eminently putdownable.<br />But then I read a couple decent reviews and realized that the author is a columnist for the consistently<br />diverting NY Press, so I figured it was worth a shot.  Well, from the opening pages, where he analyzes<br />Gene Wilder singing Pure Imagination as an endorsement of a schizophrenic world view, Jim Knipfel's<br />memoir of a six month stay in a Minneapolis psych ward is at least wryly amusing, and often laugh out<br />loud funny.<br />Particularly funny, though it obviously should not be, is his account of how he ended up there,<br />following a series of attempts to kill himself.  In order to save his family the pain of dealing with his<br />action, Knipfel, who at the time was a graduate student and teaching assistant in philosophy at the<br />University of Minnesota, decided to try framing a student who'd been sending him love notes.  In<br />order to make it look like she had stalked and killed him, he tried slashing his back with a steak knife,<br />with predictably feeble results.  Then, having experimented previously with self-asphyxiation, he<br />decided to hang himself, but found the experience much less pleasurable this time.  So finally, he tried<br />sleeping pills and whiskey, but somehow managed to stumble out into the hallway of his apartment<br />building, but not before seriously damaging his liver.<br />Taken to the hospital, he awoke screaming quotations from Nietzsche in rhymed German, and was<br />diagnosed as suffering a &quot;mixed-personality disorder.&quot;  He was thought to have undergone some kind<br />of &quot;psychotic break&quot; and was placed in a locked psychiatric ward to determine if he posed a further<br />danger to himself or the general public.  But he was not really given any therapy, nor treatments, his<br />stay basically consisted of sitting around the ward, reading the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan,<br />and then a ten minute session with a doctor once a week.  Even these brief visits though seem to have<br />been less about providing care than simply assessing his condition.  Finally, with no warning and no<br />apparent change in his mental status, Knipfel was moved to an open ward and then released, mostly<br />because he reached the maximum stay allowed by state law.<br />It would be easy enough for Knipfel to rail against the complete inadequacyof the care he received,<br />and he'd be justified, but that's not what he's after here, mercifully.  Instead he offers a rather calm and<br />dispassionate account of his experience, of the folks he met, and of the process by which he decided he<br />didn't want to kill himself anymore.  This last is where the &quot;Nairobi Trio&quot; comes in.  I'll not ruin it for<br />prospective readers; suffice it to say that they were characters who dressed up as gorillas for a musical<br />act in an old Ernie Kovacs skit, whose nearly Sisyphiphean plight Knipfel came to identify with.<br />This is a minor but worthwhile book, less concerned with milking mental illness for sympathy or<br />drama than with telling an interesting story and telling it with great humor.  Knipfel uses an interesting<br />technique in that he never actually tells the reader whether he thinks he was insane during this period<br />of time, but all of the folks around him react to him in ways that suggest he was.  Unfortunately, the<br />one part of the story that does not work well is his extended recreation of various hallucinations he<br />endured.  These are fairly tedious.  But I suppose if they made sense to us then we'd be in trouble,<br />which maybe provides the answer to the sanity question.<br />GRADE : B+of the care he received, <BR>and he'd be justified, but that's not what he's after here, mercifully.

It's not bad, it's just<br />overly cute, which is the last thing you'd expect somehow from a decade-long effort by a talented<br />young novelist.<br />The story involves a librarian, Alexander Short, who is fascinated by calligraphy, enclosures and<br />compartments, Samuel Johnson, puns, the Dewey Decimal System and various other unusual subjects.<br />Though married (inexplicably) to a seductive French artist, Alex has become quite frigid, to the point<br />where he wears a notebook on a girdle, which serves something of the role of a chastity belt.  In this<br />book he notes down (girdles) his daily encounters with anything that bears upon his topics of<br />fascination.<br />Then one day an elegant older man puts in a call slip, in exquisite handwriting, asking for the book<br />Secret Compartments in Eighteenth-Century Furniture.  In no time at all, Alex is lured into Henry<br />James Jesson III's own set of fascinations, in particular his search for an Abraham-Louis Breguet watch<br />that was designed for Marie Antoinette, the &quot;Grand Complication&quot; of the title.  A complication is a<br />watch that serves additional purposes besides telling time, in this case the Grand Complication included<br />such functions as a thermometer scale and a perpetual calender that even corrected for leap years.<br />Jesson wants it because he owns a curio cabinet in which it once resided and he's filled all the cubby<br />holes with the objects the original owner kept there except for the one in which it sat.  The search is<br />complicated by the fact that the watch was stolen from a Jerusalem museum some years previously,<br />while Alex's life is complicated by his deteriorating relationship with his wife, by run-ins with<br />officious library staff, and by his quickening suspicions that Jesson is not being straightforward with<br />him.<br />Such is the basic set up for the book, but that's just the internal mechanism of Kurzweil's own<br />complication.  Meanwhile, it helps to know that the Grand Complication is a real watch that was truly<br />stolen, that Kurzweil received a New York Public Library Research Fellowship, and, most of all, that<br />much of the action of this novel refers back to his first, A Case of Curiosities.  That tale is told by a<br />narrator who seems now to have been Jesson.  The book starts with him telling the reader that he's<br />purchased the cabinet, or &quot;case of curiosities&quot;, and that he wants to share with us the life story of the<br />cabinet's creator and the meaning behind each of the items within the case.  The creator turns out to<br />have been Claude Page, an 18th Century French watchmaker who narrowly avoided the guillotine<br />during the Revolution.  In what seemed at the time to be little more than one more period detail, the<br />narrator mentioned at the end of that book that Page at one time owned the complication.<br />Given all this as context, this new novel can be perceived as an enclosure too, the prior novel<br />embedded within it.  The intertwining between the two becomes somewhat complicated in its own<br />right and the question of where Jesson and/or Alex end and Kurzweil begins comes into play.<br />Meanwhile though, the entire shaky structure is perched upon an uncertain foundation, the obsession of<br />these three men (characters) with these antique devices and the literature and ephemera of the 1700s.<br />In A Case of Curiosities these subjects were unfamiliar and, since the main action of the novel was set<br />during Page's lifetime, it seemed natural for them to be part of the story.  By the end of this current<br />novel, the reader of both books has been subjected to over 700 pages of this stuff--that's a lot to ask<br />for one cabinet full of mementos.<br />Further, Jesson and Short, because the action of this novel occurs in a contemporary setting just seem<br />like oddballs, their obsessions little more than affectations.  At one point in the novel, Jesson says :<br />  If you ask an enthusiast of jigsaw puzzles to explain his habit, he'll tell you what he loves is the<br />  process.  Once all the pieces are in place, the puzzle retains little interest.<br />Likewise, the reader's enjoyment of this book will depend heavily on his enthusiasm for the process,<br />an enthusiasm which for my part I found waning as this sequel progressed.  And the finished puzzle<br />does hold little interest.<br />Were Kurzweil a first time author, of whom we expected little, these weaknesses would be more easily<br />excused.  In fact, if you approach the book just hoping for a mildly diverting literary thriller, it is<br />likely to be more than adequate.  But fans of A Case of Curiosities seem certain to be at least<br />somewhat disappointed and there are troubling signs within the text that another sequel will inevitably<br />follow.  That would be inexcusable.  We'll give him this one lackluster effort, but perhaps it might be<br />better for Mr. Kurzweil to escape from this one cabinet and move on to some new story.<br />GRADE : Grand Complication : C<br /><br />A Case of Curiosities : B+ff--that's a lot to ask <BR>for one cabinet full of mementos.<br />Further, Jesson and Short, because the action of this novel occurs in a contemporary setting just seem <BR>like oddballs, their obsessions little more than affectations.

Foremost of these was, of course,<br />Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson.<br />I may well be wrong here, but it seems to me that Stevenson pioneered one of the central techniques of<br />children's literature ; placing a child at the center of what might otherwise be a typical adult adventure<br />novel.  This simple but ingenious idea gives kids a character to identify with and allows the author to<br />write from the child's perspective.<br />In the case of Treasure Island, young Jim Hawkins narrates the story of how he and Squire Trelawney,<br />Dr. Livesey, and the enigmatic Long John Silver ended up on board the Hispaniola, looking for the<br />lost treasure of the notorious pirate Captain John Flint.  Packed with betrayals, battles, mutinies, and<br />even a parrot squawking &quot;Pieces of eight!

Ralph Wetterhahn's Last Battle is a healthy reminder of how deep<br />and of some of the reasons why.<br />The book succeeds in three disparate tasks.  First, Wetterhahn, a former Air Force pilot, reconstructs<br />the rarely told--and, his research suggests, never completely told before--story of the Mayaguez<br />&quot;rescue&quot;, in May 1975, adeptly switching back and forth between the deadly military action and the<br />political games being played in the Ford White House.  The stark contrast between the bravery of the<br />men on the ground and the conniving of Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger, in particular, is an ugly<br />reminder of how disconnected the private political concerns of Washington politicians had become<br />from the reality of sending men to die in Southeast Asia.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion, and<br />Wetterhahn makes it even harder, that the Mayaguez affair was scene by Gerald Ford as an easy and<br />cheap way to deflect attention from the ignominious Fall of Saigon two weeks earlier and from his<br />disastrous pardon of Richard Nixon.<br />Even more maddening is the level of chaos and incompetence that Wetterhahn depicts at the highest<br />levels of the decision making process.  From attacking the wrong island to commencing after the<br />Cambodians had already announced they would release the ship to President Ford actually issuing<br />orders to pilots during the attack, the whole mess is one long example of how not to use American<br />military might.  One illustrative moment, which would be funny if it weren't so frightening, sees the<br />White House photographer speak up during a meeting to suggest that the massive retaliation Ford is<br />contemplating might be inappropriate.  And the most shocking portions of the book detail the<br />administration's willingness to cover up how many men were lost in the engagement--41, including 23<br />Air Force servicemen killed in a helicopter crash which was treated as if it had nothing to do with the<br />exercise--and the fact that three Marines, still alive and fighting when last seen, were left behind on<br />Koh Tang Island.<br />Wetterhahn does an excellent job of dissecting the whole morass and drawing out lessons from it.  He<br />also makes a convincing case that the failure to openly discuss the problems at the time may well have<br />contributed to future disasters like the botched Iranian hostage rescue in the Carter administration.<br />The final portion of the book is the most poignant though, as Wetterhahn, by now pretty much<br />obsessed with the fate of those three marines, spends years ping-ponging between the US government<br />and Cambodia, trying to determine their fate and recover them or their remains.  Here the story takes<br />on both the nature of a mystery tale, the fate of the three at the heart of it, and of a psychological<br />thriller, with Wetterhahn's own need to reach finality practically taking control of his life.<br />Mr. Wetterhahn deserves great credit for sinking his teeth into this story and refusing to let go.  His<br />determination pays off in the fullest portrait we're likely to get of a relatively minor incident that<br />reveals more than we might like to know about the shabby way we treated our military forces during<br />the Vietnam era.  In the end, it reveals the terrible costs, in human lives, human emotions, and the<br />continuance of faulty, even deadly, procedures, that is paid when government refuses to honestly face<br />up to the consequences of its actions.  Though the events herein happened almost thirty years ago, the<br />lessons to be learned are always timely.  And it is never too late to honor the sacrifices made by our<br />fighting men.  For three brave Marines--Danny G. Marshall, Joseph Nelson Hargrove, and Gary Lee<br />Hall--that recognition has waited until now, but they well deserve it.<br />GRADE : A.

There are retired players<br />because Henry has played out over fifty UBA seasons.  Henry hasn't simply created a game, he's<br />created a personal Universe.<br />The greatest player in Association history was Brock Rutherford and now his son, Damon Rutherford,<br />is taking the UBA by storm.  Henry's enthusiasm for the Association has waned in recent years, but the<br />rise of Damon Rutherford has renewed his interest.  Suddenly the game is fun again and Henry's life<br />seems full &amp; interesting.  When young Damon throws a perfect game, Henry is so caught up in the<br />excitement that he tampers with his own rules and allows Damon to start his next game on one day of<br />rest.  And, of course, when the Creator tampers with his own rules, his creations will pay the price.<br />The first 150 or so pages of this book are absolutely fabulous.  As disaster befalls the Association &amp;<br />Henry's life crumbles around him he loses the ability to separate reality from fantasy and the book too<br />becomes confused, but it is still a terrific read.<br />GRADE: A-	2001-08-31

Its a book that's all about the bright possibilities of youth, when the whole world seems magical. With Something Wicked This Way Comes, he looks at the flip side, how as we get older we discover that evil exists in the world too, and not just that it exists but that it is alluring, to us and all those around us.<br />It's 1929, in Green Town, Illinois, and Jim Nightshade and William Halloway are thirteen, right on the traditional cusp of manhood. They are still boys when the dark carnival, Cooger &amp; Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, comes to town, but by the time it leaves they'll have grown up, for Mr. Dark, ringleader of the carnival, offers people their deepest darkest desires in exchange for their souls. Many of the townfolk, including Will's own father will be seduced by the offer of a return to youth, while Jim will find the offer of growing up fast irresistible. But Will can see what's going on and first saves his father and then the two of them fight to save Jim and the town. This book is thrilling, scary, and, most important, wise in the ways of man. Bradbury well understands that evil is such a powerful force not because it is so awful, but because it is so attractive. The people of Green Town aren't necessarily bad people, but in their willingness to exchange their very souls for an easy chance to be something that they are not, they head down the path of evil. What Mr. Dark is offering is unnatural in the strictest sense of the word, it violates the laws of nature, and Will's struggle against him is truly heroic, maybe even Biblical. You'll not often hear him listed among the great American authors, but with this book, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 to his credit, Ray Bradbury may deserve at least a mention.<br />GRADE : A	2001-08-30

He had the good fortune to begin his career in 1977, when punk rock was revitalizing the music scene, and was hired by New Music Express (NME), the best of the British music periodicals. Today he's mainly writing reviews for The Guardian, still some music but also books and stuff.<br />This collection of material is fairly wide-ranging, though, oddly enough, the rock music writing is the least interesting in the book. Penman's style is fairly slangy and staccato, so some of it is tough sledding for an American reader. Plus, some of his concerns, has been bands, British TV, sex, drugs, alcohol, are a tad parochial. I guess his trademark is the clever use of parentheses to express double meanings--(c)harmless; in(ter)dependence; etc.--which can be amusing but is always distracting. What redeems the book are some very good essays on such varied topics as The Rockford Files, Steve Martin, Harry Dean Stanton, Clint Eastwood and Jim Thompson, all of them positive, and then some real bloodlettings performed on Quentin Tarantino, Jack Nicholson, Frank Zappa, and a few others. I disagree with only the Tarantino assessment, but even it is done with such gusto that it's at least enjoyable. On balance, there's more good than bad here and it was enough to get me to look for his byline in the future.<br />GRADE : C+	2001-08-30

Flyfishing is, for the most part, the pursuit of the leisure classes, the rest of use spinning reels to baitfish or to go after bass with a variety of garish lures. We associate bass fishing with the sound of overpowerful boats and the sour smell of stale beer. Flyfishing gives off a faint whiff of soggy tweed, mixed with pipe tobacco and perhaps a fine brandy. Your ne'er-do-well uncle bass fishes, your successful granddad flyfished. All of which makes Peter Kaminsky's new book something of a rarity; kind of a more muscular, less cultured, less aristocratic, flyfishing memoir.<br />In large part this is owing to the setting that Kaminsky has chosen; no trips to Idaho or Montana here; no Australian Outback or Scottish Highlands; instead he spends the late Summer/early Fall out at Montauk Point, Long Island, fishing with friends and family, guides and sportsmen, locals and commercial fisherman for stiped bass, albacore, and the like. Both the type of fishing--for bigger fish, on rough seas, battling surfcasters and other boats--and the crowded and competitive conditions make this much different than the typical pastoral treatise on flyfishing. It's a very New York kind of fishing going on here, democratic and combative.<br />Beyond the unusual milieu, the book is a must read for the quality of Kaminsky's prose.... Fall's just around the corner now, and if you can't get to Montauk, this book's the next best thing.<br />GRADE : A	2001-08-30

But in Ian McEwan's novel, the &quot;innocent&quot; of the title is Leonard Marnham, a young British telephone technician, who has come to a divided Berlin in 1955, to work on one of the great intelligence coups of the Cold War, Operation Gold, a tap on the Soviet telephone lines in a tunnel beneath the city. Not only is Leonard an innocent when it comes to superpower espionage, he's also a neophyte when it comes to women, so when Maria, an attractive German woman, approaches him in a nightclub and then begins a torrid affair with him, he's too dense to see why it might raise the suspicions.<br />Inevitably, the story concerns the loss of innocence, and Leonard begins to change in some frightening ways. Chiefly, he begins to associate himself with the conquering West and Maria with the defeated Germany, treating her with mounting brutality in their lovemaking, until one day he goes too far. But the lovers make it through this rough patch only to face a crisis when they accidentally kill Maria's ex-husband. This event triggers a catastrophe of international dimensions, as innocent, now become guilty, brings down everything around him. There are final ironies here that it would be unfair to prospective readers to discuss; suffice it to say that it turns out that everyone else has been just as innocent of the real world as Leonard seemed, or at least as easily duped.<br />The book is an adequate spy novel, with some interesting true background--Operation Gold was a real project. But in a strange way those final ironies serve to blunt the impact of the book, revealing that however corrupting were the effects of the Cold War, we in the West were never sufficiently corrupt to understand what was really going on.

But the seemingly interminable book requires the reader, once again, to surrender to the belief that peasants were happier than are we and had some special wisdom that we have lost as we've distanced ourselves from nature and the earth. De Bernieres himself sort of makes fun of this<br />viewpoint when, after the War, a Canadian poet comes to the Greek isle of Cephalonia :<br />He was the first in the new vanguard of Western romantic intellectuals with Byronic aspirations, and<br />he was looking for a simple house amongst simple people of the earth where he could get to grips<br />with the truly gritty realities of life.<br />Pokes fun, but this seems to be the entire point of the book. All of the islanders are achingly precious, their lives idyllic, their society charming, but then war comes, well actually, its not even the war, they're still fine when it's just the equally cute Italians, but then the Nazis come, and this wonderful culture is destroyed.<br />Here's my question though : everyone's always nattering on about how wonderful the lives of agrarian and aboriginal peoples were, how in tune with nature, at one with the land; so how come no one ever wants to be a peasant when they grow up, most especially the peasants themselves ?

Young Jiro tries to help his father to make puppets for the local theater, but is so clumsy he's more a hindrance than a help, which his shrieking harridan of a mother is only too willing to point out. When one day he accompanies his father to the theater, sees how much food they have, and is complimented by the owner, Jiro decides to ask for work there. He is taken on, but Yoshida, the Master Puppeteer, proves to be an exacting taskmaster. He is particularly hard on his own son, Kinshi, who warns Jiro : We all learn here by the honorable path of horrible mistakes. But learn they do, and eventually Jiro learns that there's a mysterious connection between the theater and Saburo, the Robin Hood-like thief, who is stealing rice from city officials and rich merchants, to give to the poor. The excitement in this book, and it's considerable, comes from the mounting political tensions  gripping the city. But the real fascination comes from the detailed world of the theater that Paterson presents. Ms Paterson is one of the most decorated author's of children's books--this one won a National Book Award--and it's easy to see why. The Master Puppeteer is both fun and informative.

Nor is it necessarily, nor even likely, the &quot;serious&quot; books that effect the change. In terms of it's political impact, there may never have been a more important novel than Uncle Tom's Cabin, which is hardly the stuff of academic studies and literary criticism. Similarly, The Lost Weekend, though in many ways resembling nothing so much as a pulp fiction or a hardboiled noir, had a tremendous influence on American attitudes towards alcoholism and alcoholics, making it a surprisingly significant book.<br />Charles Jackson's semi-autobiographical tale follows the &quot;promising&quot; writer Don Birnam for one four day weekend as he descends into the depths of alcoholic despair and debauchery. Birnam's overly protective younger brother, Wick, goes out of town, leaving Don on his own in their apartment, even though he fears that, as usual, Don will take advantage of his independence to go on a binge. Wick has tried to limit the damage by controlling Don's allowance, from a family trust, but Don has perfected all kinds of scams for getting more and as the weekend progresses he comes up with some new ones. These include everything from stealing a purse to a rather pitiful attempt to find a pawn shop that's open on Yom Kippur, to hock his typewriter. Finally, he even steals and pawns his girlfriend's fur coat after she, Helen, tracks him down and tries nursing him through a period of delirium.<br />Besides the robberies from family, friends, and strangers, Jackson shows the effect of the drinking on Don's behavior towards others as he stands up a dinner date, takes advantage of a kindly local merchant, and unmercifully exploits Wick and Helen and their concern for him. He also shows the physical effects in Don's urgent need for drink, a brief stay at Bellevue (or a hospital very much like it) after falling down the stairs and fracturing his skull, and finally in the chillingly described delirium tremens and hallucinations.<br />Books, movies, and television have all made alcoholism a staple theme, but when Jackson wrote this book alcohol was merely a comic device in literature, and alcoholism was taken to be a function of the liquor itself and of the spiritual weakness of the drunk. Much of the book anticipates future findings about the true nature of the disease. In the first place, Don is not a skid row derelict. He's a cultured and talented young man from a decent family. Nor is he simply beholden to the bottle; his alcoholism is just a manifestation of much deeper psychological problems, in his case either repressed homosexuality or fear of the very possibility. His downward spiral began in college after an incident involving a crush on a fraternity brother and he reacts with horror when a male nurse at Bellevue propositions him. Even if he were to stop drinking, Don Birnam would still be a profoundly troubled man, would still be desperately ill.<br />Jackson also anticipates the concept of &quot;enablers&quot;, which is what the folks around Birnam really are. Wick and Helen obviously care about him, but their willingness to cover for him and their unwillingness to confront him makes them participants in the problem. They and Don are kind of archetypal examples of dysfunction as the drinking has become the core of his existence, shutting out any capacity to relate honestly with others, and they have been reduced to lying, to him and to themselves, and compensating for his behavior, essentially putting his drinking at the core of their lives too.<br />In all of this Jackson was years ahead of his time. The book, which became a bestseller, and the excellent Billy Wilder film version, which studios were reluctant to make but which became a surprise hit and Academy Award winner, ushered in an era when attitudes towards alcoholism began to change and the hitherto hidden problem began to be addressedmore honestly. But beyond this social impact, it's just a really good book, one that stands the test of time and which has probably never been bettered in its portrait of an alcoholic.<br />GRADE : Astly.

I don't like to leave things hanging and I thought it might make it a little less hard to retire if I got this thing settled. -Andy Rosenzweig, A Cold Case In this short but surprisingly affecting book, Philip Gourevitch examines just one &quot;cold case&quot;, a twenty seven year old double murder that has bothered Andy Rosenzweig since it occurred. In 1970, after an argument in a bar, Frank Koehler met the two men he'd been in the earlier confrontation with and left them, Richie Glennon and Pete McGinn, dead on the floor of McGinn's apartment. Koehler then disappeared. Rosenzweig was just a patrolman then, but Glennon had attended his wedding, so the failure of police to ever capture Koehler was galling. In 1997, with his retirement just around the corner, Rosenzweig was on his way to the doctor's office and passed by the restaurant where the original argument had occurred, recalling, for the first time in a while, that Koehler had still never been brought in, Rosenzweig, by now the chief investigator for the Manhattan District Attorney, determined to finally close this case in his waning days on the job. This is an unusual kind of crime story. There's no mystery : we know who the culprit is in the first few pages. All the violence and most of the action takes place early on too. There's a little bit of courtroom drama, but it's mostly kept off stage. Instead, the book is mostly a profile of a few fascinating characters.  Rosenzweig dominates the book's first half, a nearly perfect cop--honest, hardworking, and dedicated to the ideal of justice. It is his personal obsession with seeing that Koehler pays for the murder of Glennon that drives the story. He's kind of the positive version of Javert in Les Miserables. In the second half, with Koehler at last arrested and facing trial, it is the criminal who dominates. Frank Koehler, who had already done time for a murder he committed as a teenager, comes across as a cold-blooded killer, who, even now, in his 70s, contemplated shooting it out with the officers who came to arrest him in Penn Station or, before that, killing a cop a day until they agreed to stop pursuing him. In what Gourevitch says law enforcement officials consider a textbook depiction of the criminal mind, Koehler gives a videotaped confession in which he expresses no contrition about the original crime and seems to think he deserves credit for the killings he contemplated but didn't commit. But then, once he's imprisoned, Koehler shows a surprisingly spiritual side to his nature. Though Gourevitch, thankfully, never lets him off the hook for his violent past, he does show Koehler to be a more complex man than we might wish to believe. One particular facet of his personality that should give us all pause is that he appears to have modeled his behavior on that of characters in old gangster movies, like James Cagney. It makes you wonder what kids who learn their values from today's pop culture will be like. This latter part of the book introduces another interesting character, defense attorney Murray Richman. Amusingly free of any scruples about the work he does, representing admitted criminals, Richman provides some comic relief to the story and serves as kind of a moral bridge between the two main characters, straddling the line between the Law and the bad guys. Much of this first appeared in The New Yorker, for which Gourevitch is a staff writer, and it has the feel of a stretched out magazine piece, even if a superior one. I wouldn't have minded hearing more about all three of these men, but I suppose it's better to leave us wanting more than overstuffed.

Sadly, he proceeds to embarrass himself utterly. The chain gang of the title is his completely inapt metaphor for modern economic life. Imagine the disdain with which folks like Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, W.E.B. DuBois, Paul Robeson,  Jackie Robinson, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcom X, and other genuine heroes of the fight for civil rights for blacks would greet Mosely's bizarre assertion that we are all enslaved in modern America : Everywhere I look I see chains, from the planned obsolescence that binds us to an endless line of ever more useless machines to captivating television shows about nothing to the value of the dollar bills insecurely nestled at the bottom of my pocket. For hundreds of years, Africans (an estimated 10 million) were captured, chained and sold; taken by force to America in the festering bowels of transport ships; sold again and enslaved by white masters; denied all rights and freedoms; forced to work from cradle to grave; beaten; raped; murdered; their families split apart on a whim. This entire system is a stinking blot upon the nation's honor, one which whites had a chance to expunge with the bloodshed and destruction of the Civil War, but which was immediately replenished when frightened and embittered Southerners, with the willing acquiescence of their Northern countrymen, imposed a system of apartheid on the newly freed black population. This time, the outrage of Jim Crow persisted until blacks themselves, in an awe inspiring display of moral and physical courage, used peaceful civil disobedience to shame white America into finally giving them the equal rights they'd long been promised. How can anyone compare this legacy of genuine and horrifying oppression to such trivial matters as overconsumption of appliances and watching too much Seinfeld ? Mosley actually has the temerity at one point to say that : &quot;There is an echo of Jim Crow in the HMO...&quot; One needn't love HMOs to recognize the difference between a mostly successful effort to provide cheap health care, on the one hand, and, on the other, the systematic and official enforcement of political and economic discrimination against an entire segment of the population based solely on the color of their skin. The effort to equate the two is so absurd as not to deserve to be taken seriously. Equally unserious is Mosely's prescription for what should be done to free us from the bondage of capitalism : (1) Take a self-imposed break from electronic media (though for some reason print media is allowed) (2) Tell the truth once a day. (3) Make a list of the things you demand from the system. Please... By the time he gets to his presidential platform you're unsure whether the whole book isn't just an elaborate hoax. Here's what he proposes : educate children; take care of the aged; pay doctors' medical malpractice premiums; educate more doctors and nurses; either legalize drugs or stop their importation into the country; have a conference on capital punishment; create rights to a living wage, health care, and an equal share in the Gross Domestic Product; and enter into international agreements to assure the same to all foreign workers too. As a candidate he would be some kind of weird melding of Bill Clinton, proposing only programs that everyone supports, and Lenin, reintroducing socialism. What's most surprising, or maybe not, about all of this, is that the radical egalitarianism that he envisions would essentially return him, and the rest of us, to the plantation. He calls it utopian, but at every step his politics requires that the freedom of some be curtailed in order to benefit others. In his great autobiography, Up From Slavery, Booker T. Washington talks about the terror with which many newlyfreed blacks faced the prospect of freedom, after the Civil War. A people who had been completely, though involuntarily, dependent on the largesse of their masters was suddenly thrust out into the world and told to fend for themselves. How could this not have been frightening ? And, indeed, freedom, in the words of the old 60s slogan, isn't free. It requires that each of us take responsibility for ourselves and inevitably some will do better than others. But it is deeply discouraging that, some 150 years later--after a 20th Century in which his ideas were already tested and found to lead not to Utopia but to the Gulag--at least one of their descendants is no more prepared to leave the plantation than they were. There's a scene at the end of the movie version of Devil in a Blue Dress that is one of the most ineffably poignant in all of film. Ezekiel Rawlins (Denzel Washington) is standing in the street in front of his house, just looking around his middle class neighborhood. The viewer is achingly aware that where the scene depicts nuclear families, homeowners, workers, a people whose great achievement is to have survived all that the white man tried doing to them and to have built this community in the face of those odds, in just a few short years that was all destroyed by the presumably well-intentioned replacement of the ideal of self-reliance by a system of Big Government paternalism. You can't help but wonder if that community might have continued to thrive if they'd simply been left to themselves, rather than being submitted to the Great Society. What a high price was paid when freedom, however challenging, was replaced by security. Apparently, Mosley believes it's worth paying again. I beg to differ.

One who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not entertain. BORE, n. A person who talks when you wish him to listen. CONSULT, v.i. To seek another's disapproval of a course already decided on. CYNIC, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision. DICTIONARY, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work. DISCRIMINATE, v.i. To note the particulars in which one person or thing is, if possible, more objectionable than another. EDUCATION, n. That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding. FUTURE, n. That period of time in which our affairs prosper, our friends are true and our happiness is assured. HISTORY, n. An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools.... A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling... He has the last word in  everything; his decision is unappealable. He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line. POLITICS, n. A strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles. The conduct of public affairs for private advantage. And, my choice for the very best among them : CONSERVATIVE, n.

But Army Intelligence officer Michael Connolly isn't investigating just any murder; the  corpse found in a Santa Fe park is that of a Los Alamos security officer and it is early April, 1945.  Though the victim is found with his pants around his ankles, suggesting a possible tie to a previous  unsolved homosexual murder, it is Connolly's job to be certain that the case does not effect security at  the most secretive and important military installation in the country.<br />Kanon uses the setting and real life characters to good effect.  The story unfolds as final preparations  are made for testing the atomic bomb and concludes on the night of Trinity, with the blast being the  most impressive bit of writing in the book.  Kanon's hardly the first to exploit the natural tension  between the very different General Leslie Groves--blunt, bluff, and straightforward--and J. Robert  Oppenheimer--all introspection and angst--but he does so capably.  And the questions of whether to  use the bomb and what motivated those who spied for the Soviets provide a patina of moral  seriousness.<br />Unfortunately though, much of this historical drama is undercut by what we now know of the real  history.  Obviously we know that the bomb will work and that it will be dropped on Japan.  More  importantly, we know that the Manhattan Project was thoroughly infiltrated by Soviet Intelligence and  that even some of the scientists who were not Communists may have supplied information to the  Soviets.  They may honestly have believed that the post-War world would be better off if both  superpowers had the bomb, but, whether they were right or not (a fight we need not take up here),  such actions on their part were nonetheless treasonous.<br />Of course, the big question concerns Oppenheimer himself.  With the fall of the Soviet Union, there  has been some corroboration of the accusation that he too aided the Soviet Union (see particularly the  memoirs of Pavel Sudoplatov, Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness--A Soviet  Spymaster), but nothing definitive has come out.  I recall my first exposure to Oppenheimer was a  miniseries in 1980 which not only sought to portray him as something of a martyr to anti-Communist  witch hunts, but which, given the context of the times, was at least an oblique commentary on US  paranoia as a cause of the Cold War.  Now that we can step back and look at the Oppenheimer case  with a little less emotion, it seems unimportant whether he actually committed any acts of espionage  himself; what seems truly bizarre is that a man who had belonged to Communist front groups and  whose wife, brother, and many friends were all Communists, at one time or another, was put, and left,  in charge of the project in the first place.  Though he was reviled for saying so, one has to agree with  Edward Teller's testimony at Oppenheimer's security hearings that the nation would be more secure  with Oppenheimer out of government.<br />At any rate, considering the ease with which the Soviets obtained the supposedly safely guarded atomic  secrets, it's a little bit difficult to take the book's espionage plotline seriously.  In fact, the book would  have benefited from a little less of the standard chase, since its outcome doesn't ultimately matter, and  a little further exploration of the motivations and consequences of the real spying that went on there.<br />GRADE : Cion that he too aided the Soviet Union (see particularly the  memoirs of Pavel Sudoplatov, Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness--A Soviet  Spymaster), but nothing definitive has come out.

Pretty much before this supposedly paradigm-shifting dictionary even rolled off the presses, the  Associated Press nailed them for a series of inconsistencies which call the book's value as a reference  into question. The problems range from referring to Abigail Adams not as &quot;first lady&quot; but as a  &quot;feminist&quot; to referring to J. Edgar Hoover as only &quot;a lawyer.&quot;  Perhaps the most frightening is calling  Francisco Franco an &quot;authoritarian leader&quot; but Joseph Stalin merely a &quot;statesman.&quot;  It's doubtless a  tough task to maintain consistency throughout a work of 1728 pages that contains a whopping 320,000  entries, but mistakes like these are troubling.<br />On the plus side, the book does have a few decent innovations, like intentional listings of commonly  misspelled words (with a slash through them) which guide you to the correct spelling.  There's also a  guide to doing research on the Internet and an English Usage Guide, though one would hope that every  college student still has a Strunk &amp; White on his desk.<br />In the end though, the book must be judged by the standard it sets for itself : &quot;The First Dictionary for  the Internet Age.&quot;  This strikes me as silly.  The promise of the Internet is that it can place all kinds of  information right at anyone's fingertips with the tap of a few keys; what then is the need for a paper  dictionary ? It will be argued that there are times when you will want to look up a word without  logging on.  However, this dictionary is quite specifically targeted at college students and intended to  help them write their papers.  At such times, it seems safe to assume they will be on a computer, does  it not ?<br />I can only speak for myself here, but I look up a lot of words and I always use the online dictionaries.  And if I want to know about Francisco Franco, I use an online encyclopaedia and a search engine.  If  this is true of a forty year old man who doesn't know how to type, what are the chances that some  punk kid is going to grab a reference book ?

(Midnight Classics)	Books	5	22	25	N	N	tough	Though better known in it's somewhat milder film version, this is a brisk, brutal crime novel in which  a Depression dance marathon becomes a metaphor for the harsh and unrelenting grind of real life.  Couple #22, Robert Syverton and Gloria Beatty, have come to Hollywood to break into the movie  business, but having had no luck, end up in a spectacle that's like something out of the Roman  Coliseum.<br />By novel's end the couples have been dancing for almost 900 hours, with only a ten minute break  every two hours.  The 144 couples who started have dwindled down to twenty.  Many dropped out  early, but many more have been eliminated in the frantic derby races that were instituted to draw in  crowds.  When dancers merely pass out, which they frequently do, they are awakened with smelling  salts or ice baths and pushed right back onto the floor.  But times are so bad that Robert has actually  put on five pounds during the ordeal--meals are supplied for free--and most of the other contestants  have gained weight too.<br />He's content to keep going, hoping that he'll be &quot;discovered&quot; by one of the film world glitterati  attending the marathon or that he can use the prize money to direct a picture of his own.  But Gloria is  completely fatalistic :<br />  This whole business is a merry-go-round.  When we get out of here we're right back where we  started.<br />She tries convincing one of the other dancers, who is pregnant, to get an abortion, for the good of the  baby, and she continually tells Robert that she wishes she were dead.  Suffice it to say she gets her  wish.<br />We tend to want to view our grandparents as having led sheltered lives, unaware of all the oh-so-tough  realities that we face so honestly today.  This almost sadistically frank pulp fiction from 1935 will cure  anyone of the delusion that earlier generations didn't know the score.  With murder, incest, abortion,  and the like generously added to a plot about people entertaining themselves by watching the misery of  others, it's like one of these eliminationist &quot;reality&quot; television shows (Survivor, Big Brother, etc.) as  conceived by the creative team of Thomas Hobbes and Charles Darwin.  These lives are indeed nasty,  brutish, and short.

He is in an open state of rebellion against the rigidity of his itinerant  preacher grandfather and his strict mother.  So when one of the first people he encounters is the blind  street preacher Asa Hawks and Motes finds himself both attracted and repelled by Hawks' bewitching  fifteen year old daughter Lily Sabbath, he reacts by establishing his own street ministry.  He founds  the &quot;Church without Christ&quot;:<br />  Listen you people, I'm going to take the truth with me wherever I go.  I'm going to preach it to  whoever'll listen at whatever place.  I'm going to preach there was no Fall because there was  nothing to fall from and no Redemption because there was no Fall and no Judgment because there  wasn't the first two.  Nothing matters but that Jesus was a liar.<br />As you can guess the church is singularly unsuccessful, although he does attract a couple of other  crackpots:  Enoch Emery a young man who works at the zoo and longs for a kind word from  anybody; and Onnie Jay Holy, yet another rival preacher who believes Motes when he says he's found  a &quot;new jesus.&quot;<br />While at first this cast of bizarre characters, ranging from merely repugnant to truly evil, and the  scenes of physical, moral and  spiritual degradation through which they pass all seem to be just a little  too much, the reader is carried along by O'Connor's sure hand for dark comedy.  The book is very  funny.  But as the story draws to a close, O'Connor's true mission is revealed; Motes loses his fight  against faith and he achieves a kind of grace, becoming something like a Christian martyr to atone for  his sins.  O'Connor has something serious and important to say about the modern human condition and  the emptiness of a life without faith.  That she is able to disguise this message in such a ribald comic  package is quite an achievement.<br />Reading the book inevitably called to mind Carson McCullers' dreadful book The Heart Is a Lonely  Hunter (1940), which made the Modern Library Top 100 Novels of the Twentieth Century list.  It too  is a Southern gothic, populated by dismal misanthropes.  But it is devoid of humor and has nothing to  say about the characters and the world they've created.

That said, I'll now acknowledge that I very nearly started  sobbing...<br />In 1976, Katherine Paterson's son David was 8 years old when his friend, Lisa Hill, was struck by  lightning and killed.  A year later Bridge to Terabithia was published, winning a Newberry Medal and  becoming, if such a thing is possible, an instant classic. Ms Paterson drew upon this personal tragedy  to create the story of a boy, Jess Aarons, and a girl, Leslie Burke, in rural Virginia, who become the  best of friends.  Jess is the middle child, and only son, of a reticent father, who struggles to earn a  living.  Leslie is the daughter, and only child, of two successful writers who have moved to the  country, next door to the Aarons, for lifestyle reasons.<br />The friendship between the two kids is hesitant at first, particularly after Leslie usurps Jess's title as the  fastest runner in their 5th grade class at Lark Creek Elementary.  But both have some trouble fitting in  with theirs peers, Jess because of his interest in Art, Leslie because of her scholastic ability and her  parents' very 70s social attitudes (like not having a TV), and this shared awkwardness gives them a  unique bond.  Leslie creates an imaginary kingdom called Terabithia for them to rule over, accessible  only be a rope swing over a local creek.  The imaginary adventures they share there and a series of  incidents at school bring the two closer and closer together.  But then an ugly reality intrudes upon  their idyllic world and the various characters are forced to deal with a tragic death.  To say more  might ruin the story, so let's leave it at that.<br />I understand that the use of this book in classrooms is frequently challenged by parents.  If the reason  for this is that they feel that the central crisis of the book may be too intense for children, I can  sympathize with their feeling.  But it seems like an intensity that is well worth their children's while.  Ms Paterson handles the situation quite beautifully and affords a real opportunity for parents to discuss  the matter of death with their kids, a topic which most families hopefully haven't much had to cope  with.  Reading the book is a difficult emotional experience, but better to first confront these emotions  in a controlled fictional setting and begin to learn how to deal with them, than to remain totally  sheltered and have to deal with them, completely unprepared, when the tragedy is real.<br />GRADE : An the story, so let's leave it at that.<br />I understand that the use of this book in classrooms is frequently challenged by parents.

In the story she must come to grips with the suicide  of her daughter, Keiko,  by the first marriage.  She does so by recalling the Summer in Nagasaki when  she was pregnant with Keiko, and her own friendship there with Sachiko, who, having lost her  husband and a son (in the bombing ?), insists on moving forward optimistically, deluding herself into  believing that an American named Frank will take her away to a new life in the States.<br />The tension that emerges from the narrative comes from the several different strategies that characters  adopt : there's Sachiko's almost absurd forward-looking optimism; there's the backward-looking  nostalgia of Etsuko's father-in-law, which excuses much of the cultural pathology which led to Japan's  annihilation in WWII; and there's the stasis of her husband, who seems unable to move forward or to  deal with the past.  From Etsuko's life choices it is obvious that she eventually chose Sachiko's path,  but Keiko's suicide suggests the problematic nature of Etsuko's decision to choose a Western life.  Etsuko's reminiscences of life in Japan are generally favorable, in particular the visual portrait of Japan  is all done in dreamy pastels, the &quot;pale view&quot; of the title.  And in the novel's closing pages, as Etsuko's  younger daughter disparages the submissive role of women in Japan, Etsuko responds that :<br />  It's not a bad thing at all, the old Japanese way.<br />This suggests that she may regret the decisions that she has made, but the story ends with a surprising  revelation about the relationships of the various characters and with Etsuko, despite her own regrets,  seeming to at least accept the enthusiasm with which her daughter Nicki embraces the West's cultural  freedom.<br />Ishiguro's first novel is similar in narrative style to the much better known Remains of the Day.  Both  stories are told by somewhat unreliable narrators, who are certainly giving us an incomplete version of  events, though we don't know whether they are lying to themselves at the same time.  Remains of the  Day benefits greatly from two elements that give it a dramatic tension which is sadly lacking here.  First, there's the rise of Nazi Germany in the background, which we know will eventually make Lord  Darlington's efforts to keep England out of the War seem somehow tainted.  Second, there's the almost  unbearable non-courtship/courtship between Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton.  In Pale View, we'd sort of  like to understand the suicide, but it's never an imperative.<br />In light of the fact that Kazuo Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki in 1954, and that his family emigrated to  England when he was six, it is impossible to avoid viewing this book as at least something of a  self-portrait.  It is certainly easy to understand that he would feel himself to be an outsider to both his  native and his adopted cultures, and as a conservative, I'd be the last one to dismiss either someone's  feelings of nostalgia for a lost past or their intuition that the freedom to be found in the West often  comes at the price of a  kind of cultural atomization, but the Japan that he describes here doesn't seem  to bear much relation to the real nation.  The &quot;pale view&quot; is perhaps too filtered to take into account  exactly the kind of racist, militarist, static society that Japan had developed into by the time of WWII,  and how little it has done in the ensuing years to reinvigorate itself.<br />Ishiguro himself has said :<br />  In some ways I think that nostalgia can be quite a positive emotion. It does allow us to picture a  better world. It's kind of an emotional sister of idealism.<br />That's quite true, but a nostalgia which is uninformed by reality is just as dangerous as idealism, which  by definition is always a stranger to reality.  For all the faults of modern Britain, and they are legion,  it has to be better than the Japan of the 1940's.<br />The novel is interesting chiefly for the clues it reveals about Ishiguro's psychology and for the patterns  it establishes for his subsequent writing.  But it is entirely too subtle and languidly paced to hold the  reader's interest (this unsubtle reader's anyway), and the past it longs for is too imperfect for us to  easily share in the longing.<br />GRADE : Che faults of modern Britain, and they are legion,  it has to be better than the Japan of the 1940's.  <br />The novel is interesting chiefly for the clues it reveals about Ishiguro's psychology and for the patterns  it establishes for his subsequent writing.

Perhaps it would be easiest to just back up a truck full of adjectives and dump them all out.  It's a  thrilling swashbuckler, a gripping tale of betrayal and vengeance, a rip snorting desert adventure, a  throwback to the sweeping historical epics of Dumas...  There's love, lust, war, sex, pederasty, blood,  guts, betrayals, heroism, sadism, cannibalism, Francophobia, homophobia, anti-Catholicism,  anti-Islamicism...  There are emperors and slaves, dukes and beggars, nuns and whores, camels and  goats...  It will remind you of Beau Geste, of The Four Feathers, of The Count of Monte Cristo...  And so on and so forth.<br />It really is a terrific old-fashioned novel and, for the most part, they don't write them like this  anymore.  The story ranges from the Paris of the Franco-Prussian War to the Sahara Desert and back.  The plot is driven by all those great vices like greed and envy, back-stabbing and revenge, and  romantic jealousy and racial hatred.  At the heart of the story are two cousins of the noble deVries  family : Moussa, son of a French Count and a Tuareg tribeswoman whom he met on an expedition to  the Sahara; and Paul, son of a brave but obtuse colonel in the Imperial Guard and a scheming,  over-ambitious mother.  Moussa and his mother, Serena, run afoul of several French clerics,  eventually leading to a killing, which forces them to flee Paris by balloon.  Meanwhile, Paul's father is  framed for war crimes, then disappears shortly after a trial in which he is cleared only because his wife  fixes the verdict.<br />The action then shifts forward in time ten years and to the Sahara, where Moussa has had trouble  fitting in with his fellow Tuaregs, particularly his cousin on his Mother's side, Mahdi.  Paul, on the  other hand, has made it to Africa as part of the Flatters expedition, an ill-fated enterprise which sought  to find a route for a Trans-Saharan railway.  When Flatters insists on a course that will bring them  directly through the region controlled by the Tuaregs, Paul and Moussa, each unaware of the other's  presence on the scene, find themselves on opposite sides of what soon turns into a brutal slaughter, led  by Mahdi.<br />Moussa resists the worst excesses of his cousin, which, combined with their mutual attraction to a  young tribeswoman, earns him Mahdi's undying enmity.  Paul, though he survives the Flatters fiasco,  develops a nearly insane hatred of the Tuaregs, a hatred which he manages to indulge by leading  French forces in reprisal raids.  The fates continue to throw these young men together and set them  against one another, however improbably, for nearly eight hundred action-packed pages.<br />You'll love every page.

Seems that in the 19th Century, criminals would  routinely avoid the stiffer penalties for repeat offenders by simply lying about who they were.  Their  deceptions were only exposed if beat cops, specifically stationed in courtrooms and jailhouses for the  purpose, happened to recognize them and expose their real identities.  It's details like this, and the  fascinating ways in which developing ideas about penology intertwined with modern forensic  techniques that really lift this book a cut above most true crime fodder.<br />In addition, Beavan is able to draw upon a cast of characters--seemingly out of Dickens or Wilkie  Collins or even Sherlock Holmes--and a wide array of dramatic situations--bureaucratic infighting,  gruesome murders, a tragic case of mistaken identity and false imprisonment, academic fraud and  courtroom drama--to keep the story humming along like a good Victorian thriller.  At the center of the  story is Dr. Henry Faulds, who did more than any other man to develop and proselytize for  fingerprinting, but who was cheated out of the glory for this innovation by Francis Galton, a cousin of  Darwin, who was born to the manor and felt no compunction about claiming credit for the good work  of &quot;lesser&quot; men.  And the whole story is framed by a &quot;shocking tragedy at Deptford,&quot; a 1905 robbery  and double-murder in which the only piece of evidence was a single bloody fingerprint found on a  cashbox at the scene.<br />Colin Beavan, who has previously written for magazines like Esquire and Atlantic Monthly, handles  the wide cast of characters deftly and explains the underlying science clearly.

First, he has the unusual idea of  approaching the issue of race in America from the perspective of Northern New England, one of the  whitest sections of the country.  Second, the book is wildly ambitious.  The stories of the three  generations of Pelham men summon,  in turn, Cold Mountain, The Great Gatsby, and Huckleberry  Finn.  The miscegenation angle of the book is Faulknerian.  The narrative is unwaveringly serious, and the Pelhams and their women are presented as nearly iconic  figures.  Even the title of the novel is intended to call to mind the Fall of Man.  The book's every page  cries out to be treated as great literature.<br />On the other hand, the story is so contrived as to strain credulity--although the Norman and Leah  section is apparently based on a real Vermont couple. Writers of fiction are to be forgiven the conceit  that strangers fall instantly in love.  But surely once is enough for this hackneyed device.  When it  happens to three successive generations of men from one family, we're entitled to object.  Moreover,  given that the objects of their affection are in turn a slave, a hooker, and a cousin, it 's fair to ask  whether this is love at all, or whether these men are not falling in love with types, rather than actual  women.  These characters just don't seem to behave like normal human beings, and they certainly don't  speak like regular people.  The whole thing has the stagy, overwrought feel of a Greek or  Shakespearean tragedy, in which the reader is constantly aware of the deus ex machina.<br />But perhaps the greatest flaw is Lent's rather fundamental misunderstanding of the story of Man's  Fall.  The entire point of the Book of Genesis is that God has granted Man free will, despite the  troubles it will cause.  Certainly it has been a curse at times, but it is also our greatest blessing.  It  gives us the measure of freedom and control over our own lives and future that may one day enable us  too to achieve godliness.  But Lent repeatedly suggests that our fates are inevitable and inescapable,  that we have no control over our own futures because we are so tightly bound by the past :<br />  [He] did not want to be what he was. The same way Mother thought she could leave her old life behind clean he did the same.  But it does not work that way.<br />And judging from the events that befall three generations of Pelhams, he also believes that those fates,  those futures, are typically unpleasant.<br />In the Fall was released to much hoopla and has won wide critical acclaim, so some folks must be  enjoying it, or, at the very least, identifying with Jeffrey Lent's dour pessimism.

When, several years ago, I started reading a lot of fishing books, one title kept cropping up in other  books.  Every author seemed to defer to A River Runs Through It; it was universally acknowledged  to be the greatest fishing story ever written.  I dutifully sought it out and read it.  I'm sure everyone  has seen the movie by now, so I won't be giving anything away when I confess that Paul's death  upset me so much that, on that first reading, I hated the book.  It was like Old Yeller and the MASH  where Henry died and Brian's Song all rolled into one.  Returning to it better prepared, I simply  enjoyed it for the language and for the bittersweet family story it relates and I learned to love it.  Then, in 1992, Robert Redford brought the story to the screen and the beauty of the scenery and  some terrific performances, combined with the large chunks of narrative taken directly from the  book, resulted in one of the better movies of recent years and cemented the book's place in the  pantheon of great American stories.<br />Amazingly, Norman MacLean, who taught English at the University of Chicago for 43 years, did  not publish this book until 1976, after retiring from his teaching job in 1973.  I don't know whether  he had worked on the story throughout his whole life, as was the case with the posthumous book<br />Young Men and Fire, but the final product has such beautifully sculpted language, that it would not  be hard to believe that it is the end result of four decades of effort.  Here is the famous opening:<br />  In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.  We lived at the junction  of  great trout rivers in western Montana, and our father was a Presbyterian minister and a fly  fisherman  who tied his own flies and taught others.  He told us about Christ's disciples being fishermen, and  we were left to assume, as my brother and I did, that all first-class fishermen on the Sea of  Galilee  were fly fishermen and that John, the favorite, was a dry-fly fisherman.<br />And, of course, after Paul's death, Norman's father urges him:<br />  Why don't you make up a story and the people to go with it? Only then will you understand what  happened and why. It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us.<br />And the story concludes:<br />  Now nearly all those I loved and did not understand when I was young are dead, but I still reach  out to them.<br />  Of course, now I am too old to be much of a fisherman, and some friends think I shouldn't.  Like  many fly fishermen in western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I  often  do not start fishing until the cool of the evening.  Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all  existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River  and a four-count rhythm and the hope that fish will rise.<br />  Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it.  The river was cut by the  world's  great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time.  On some of the rocks are timeless  raindrops.  Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.<br />  I am haunted by waters.<br />And in between these memorable passages, MacLean unfolds a timeless story of fathers and sons and  brothers and their often futile attempts to understand one another and the way in which sport can  provide a tie, sometimes the only tie, between them.  You will be haunted by the affecting story and  by MacLean's crystalline prose in this very nearly perfect book.<br />GRADE: A+at John, the favorite, was a dry-fly fisherman.<br />And, of course, after Paul's death, Norman's father urges him:<br />   Why don't you make up a story and the people to go with it?

Fly fishing, of course, is a  pursuit of the literary classes, so it is no surprise that it has been the subject of an inordinate amount  of fine writing.  The hot young writer in this distinct niche is young James Prosek, who published  Trout: An Illustrated History (1996) while still a Yale undergraduate.  Prosek is not only a capable  author, he also paints fine watercolors to accompany his own text and he has set the hearts of middle  aged white male fishing aficionados aflutter.<br />In Joe and Me, he has written a memoir of his youth in Connecticut and of his relationship with Joe  Haines, a local game warden who busted him fishing illegally and then took him under his wing.  Prosek's parents were divorced and, though James appears to have continued living with his Dad,  Joe seems to have become something of a surrogate father.  Joe taught him about everything from  surf casting for bluefish to rendering a bull, from clamming to picking blue berries, with gruff good  humor and great generosity at almost every step of the way.<br />Perhaps this is purely a personal reaction, but I found myself really liking the somewhat  curmudgeonly Joe and wanting to give James a good shake.  He seems not to fully realize his great good  fortune in having such a mentor.  If Joe is sometimes a little too sarcastic or impatient or seems too  braggadocious, this is more than outweighed by his willingness to include this callow youth in his  world and too share a lifetime of knowledge with him.  I am cognizant of the fact that I am saying  that the author of a book about a man is unappreciative of that man.  But truthfully, I am even  bothered by the fact that the title is &quot;Joe and Me&quot;.  How about just &quot;Joe&quot;?<br />I didn't dislike this book, but I was disappointed in the overall tone.  Perhaps success has come too  quickly for the author and he will benefit from the perspective that age will bring.  I, for one, think  this would be a much different, and better, book if he rewrote it later in life.<br />GRADE: C+haps success has come too  quickly for the author and he will benefit from the perspective that age will bring.

In addition, he  penned several of the best fishing stories ever written in the continuing misadventures of George  Baldwin Potter, collected here with introductions by Foote's son, Timothy.<br />Potter, a fly fishing pedant, is a bachelor in his forties when the series opens, but he has decided to  take a young bride.  The first story, the eponymous Wedding Gift, finds him pouring out his soul to  our narrator.  Seems that George's new bride, Isabelle, was not terribly impressed with the  honeymoon that he so carefully planned, a one week trek into the wilds of Maine to fly fish.  As  George's tale wends it's convoluted way to it's conclusion, it builds towards an awful, but truly  hilarious, climax which leaves the newlyweds' marriage in a shambles.  In the next story, the  marriage has again foundered on the rocks after George, dispatched to an auction to purchase a  coveted antique, instead finds himself mesmerized by a fly rod collection.  And in the final tale,  Isabelle gets her revenge by using a brilliant but devious ploy to trick George into buying her a farm  in Connecticut.<br />The stories are a delightful screwball combination of fishing and battle-of-the-sexes comedy, sort of  Isaak Walton rewritten by Preston Sturges.

Cendrars was a poet and leader of the avant-garde in Paris in the teens and twenties.  Though  born in Switzerland, he traveled widely, almost restlessly, and his poetry is distinguished by its focus  on action.  Gold, also known as Sutter's Gold, which is perhaps his most famous prose work, seems at  least partly autobiographical, as the story of John Augustus Sutter so closely resembles the basic  pattern of the author's own life.  Sutter too was Swiss, but he abandoned his family and emigrated to  America, pulled ever westward, he eventually became extremely wealthy and one of the founders of  modern California.  But then gold was discovered at the site of his famous mill, and his land was  overrun by hordes of 49ers.  He spent the rest of his life trying to recoup his losses, through lawsuits  and pleadings to the U. S. Congress, but died without ever receiving a penny.<br />Cendrars relates this tale in a brisk and lively manner, taking us through Sutter's life at breakneck  speed.  The style is almost telegraphic as he dices 121 pages of story into 16 chapters of 74 sections. That doesn't leave him much time to develop any grand themes; the most I came away with was the  rather silly notion that, though eager Europeans fled to America seeking opportunity and wealth, even  if they struck it rich they were ultimately ruined.  France may only have been his adopted country, but  this attitude reflects the bitter, envious soul of a native.<br />GRADE : C+	2001-07-23

But the dominant one is undoubtedly the  idiosyncrasy of the author, which is revealed to an extent unusual in a 'dictionary'.  -Sir Ernest Gowers, Preface to the Revised Edition<br />Here in the States we have our beloved Strunk &amp; White to give us guidance on matters grammatical,  and it remains an indispensable reference work, even in its original form.  The British counterpart to  Elements of Style is this unique work by H.W. Fowler, minimally revised and edited by Sir Ernest  Gowers.  It too remains useful, though many entries have grown dated, but it is so idiosyncratic and  amusing that even the most obsolete of Fowler's rulings and admonitions are worth reading if for  nothing more than simple amusement.  Here are just a few of the more enjoyable ones that I found :<br />  continental.  'Your mother,' said Mr. Brownlow to Mr. Monks in Oliver Twist, 'wholly given up to  continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten years her junior.'  This use of  continental reflects the common belief in England that the Continent, especially France, offers  unwonted opportunities for gaiety and self-indulgence.  It persists in such expressions as c. Sunday,  c. cabaret, now not necessarily in the pejorative sense intended by Mr. Brownlow but suggesting  either envy or reprobation, or a mixture of both, according to the taste of the user.  Such feelings  toward what we suppose to be the continental way of life have no doubt changed with the  mellowing of Victorian prudery, but are unlikely to disappear so long as we are not allowed to  gamble where we please or to drink whenever we are so disposed.<br />  paragraph.  The purpose of paragraphing is to give the reader a rest.  The writer is saying to him:  'Have you got that?  If so, I'll go on to the next point.'  there can be no general rule about the most  suitable length for a paragraph; a succession of very short ones is as irritating as very long ones are  wearisome.<br />  reactionary. 'Except for its technical scientific sense, to which it would be a mercy if it were  confined, reactionary is a word so emotionally charged as to be little more than a term of abuse'  (Evans).  That is no less true of Britain than of America.  The word derives its pejorative sense  from the conviction, once firmly held but now badly shaken, that all progress is necessarily good.<br />  split infinitive.  The English-speaking world may be divided into (1) those who neither know nor  care what a split infinitive is; (2) those who do not know, but care very much; (3) those who know  and condemn; (4) those who know and approve; (5) those who know and distinguish.<br />  1. Those who neither know nor care are the vast majority, and are a happy folk, to be envied by  most of the minority classes.<br />As Sir Ernest says in the epigraph to this review, that's not a style we're used to finding in dictionaries.<br />Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the rest of us, there's apparently a battle amongst lexicographers, of some  years duration, over whether such usage manuals should be prescriptive or descriptive.  If descriptive,  they would merely describe what the masses have adopted as common usage.  If prescriptive, the  author tries to offer guidance and to influence future usage.  Fowler seems, to at least this  non-professional, to have struck a nice balance between the two.  He certainly has pet peeves (more  than a few) and quite forcefully argues for spellings and definitions which he feels ought to be either  stuck to or adopted, but he is also sufficiently democratic to recognize that many of these struggles,  though he might have favored a different result, had already been decided to his disfavor. Here is but one example :<br />  contact.  The use of c. as a verb (get into touch with) gave no little offence when it first appeared  here from America.  But convenience has prevailed over prejudice, and the dictionaries nowgive it  full recognition : after all, it is an ancient and valuable right of the English people to turn their  nouns into verbs when they are so minded.<br />Given this realistic attitude, one assumes he would have been able to gracefully handle the fact that  many of his suggestions have gone unheeded.<br />At any rate, from what the reviewers have to say about the most recent version of the Modern English  Usage, Fowler's successor, Robert Burchfield, would appear to have produced a work that is not only  overly descriptive, but that tends to vacillate over certain usages, as if Burchfield is unwilling to have  events prove his judgments wrong in the future.  There is no such waffling in the original, and it is a  much better book for the firmness of its author's often hilarious opinions.

Without this the restraint of  beasts was impossible.  -The Restraint of Beasts<br />Take a forty-something, bus-driving, first time novelist; start some rumors of a huge advance; for good  measure, add in a cover blurb from the notoriously reclusive Thomas Pynchon; and you've got the  recipe for a hype machine that just won't quit.  Not surprisingly, the book was nominated for both the  Booker and the Whitbread, though it didn't win either.  Meanwhile, obscured in all of this is the fact  that, like many a neophyte before him, Magnus Mills has a very clever idea for a novel here, but in the  end doesn't really seem sure what to do with it.<br />The basic story is simple enough : a nameless English narrator works for a Scottish company building  fences.  He's made foreman of a crew which consists of two sullen and lazy Scotsmen, Tam and  Richie.  The three of them are sent to England on a special job where they spend their days laying  fence, often quite lackadaisically, and their nights drinking up all their wages in local pubs.  They  leave a trail of dissatisfied customers in their wake, but fortunately, a series of accidents contrives to  also leave these customers quite dead, and buried, unceremoniously, beneath fence posts.<br />Mills presents the story in utterly straightforward fashion, the narration so affectless that the deaths are  barely noticed.  Considering the author's working class origins and the monotonous existence of the  work gang, it's natural to expect the story to turn into a parable about labor and exploitation, but  there's nary a complaint, and he makes no effort to make the workers the least bit sympathetic.  It's all  just work, drink, death, work, drink...  If they're the beasts, we'd just as soon they be restrained.<br />This is actually pretty funny, especially at first.  You can't help expecting the narrator to explain away  the deaths, but the story just moves right on past them.  Eventually though, Mills needs to do  something with the scenario he's concocted, and here he falls somewhat short.<br />Absent all the hype, this would be a perfectly acceptable first effort.  And I don't know that it's fair to  judge the book by the expectations that extraneous factors raised.  Just forget all the award nominations  and other nonsense and approach it like any other first novel and you'll enjoy it well enough.<br />GRADE : Bst moves right on past them.

But what's truly remarkable is how differently the story ends than those we've  become used to over the years.  Just thirty years ago, in Brian's Song, the story revolved around the  courage and grace with which Brian Piccolo, a 26 year old football player for the Chicago Bears,  struggled against certain doom, and how he touched the lives of those around him.  Today, not only  did Lance Armstrong survive testicular cancer--the same cancer that killed Piccolo--he was actually  able to return to championship bike racing and win that Tour de France thing. Nor is this a rarity, there  are numerous other pro athletes who have survived cancer and returned to compete at a level at least  equal to where they were prior to their illness.  In fact, it is almost tempting to become blas&eacute; about  such stories.<br />So the great service that Armstrong provides here is to detail just how frightening it still is to face such  a disease, no matter the survival rate.  In particular, the rather gory detail he goes into about the  manifestations of the cancer, and the treatment process, serves as a helpful reminder of the  psychological, as well as physical, costs that survivors pay even as they return to health.  Modern  medicine is capable of some amazing things, but it still requires a healthy dose of the human spirit to  overcome illness.  Lance Armstrong is nothing if not spirited.<br />The book may not turn you into a cycling fan--it didn't me.  But it will more than likely get you to  root for Lance Armstrong, and the other brave folks who have fought back, successfully, against  cancer.<br />GRADE : B	2001-07-16

There comes a time in any obsession when you have to learn more.  It doesn't matter whether the  object of an obsession is a person,  a sports car, a football team, or a board game.  You just do.  You need to see the shrinking world into which you are being sucked as a fully formed whole.  Before I throw myself deeper into the abyss that Scrabble appears to be, hijacking my nights,  weekends, and idle thoughts--I've started dreaming about the game--I need to understand where it  came from, and how it became an institution unlike any other in the two-hundred-year history of  the American toy industry.  To do that, I need to answer one question : Who was Alfred Butts?  -Word Freak<br />There, in a paragraph, is what you're in for once you pick up this very interesting, often amusing, but  ultimately troubling book.  Stefan Fatsis, who many will be familiar with through his sports writing  for the Wall Street Journal and/or his reports for NPR, offers both a comprehensive history of the  game of Scrabble, and a fascinating portrait of the strange netherworld of Scrabble enthusiasts, with  everyone from child prodigies to Zen Buddhists to psychiatric patients, traveling the country to get to  tournaments where the top prize is a few thousand dollars.  Though the book starts casually enough,  with Fatsis playing pick up games in Washington Square Park, by the end he's completely obsessed,  memorizing word lists, endlessly replaying blunders, and living and dying by his official Scrabble  ranking (currently 1699, an agonizing one point below the 1700 goal he set himself, and briefly  attained).<br />Now, I'm willing to bet you've got a Scrabble set in your house, maybe even more than one.  And you  probably get it down a couple times a year--most likely at Christmas time and at some point in the  Summer, when you're at the shore--play feverishly for a night or a week, and then put it away and  forget about it for another six months.  Maybe you even remember a particularly spectacular game or  turn (Personally, I recall when I was 12 and my grandfather, a Federal judge and a a truly brilliant  man, dropped the word MEASLES for the first play of the game, essentially finishing the contest right  then).  But here are a whole group of people who define themselves by, and judge their own  self-worth by, their rankings in the game.  To be a world class player requires you to memorize  literally thousands of &quot;words&quot; that you will never see in the real world.  Championship players know  every two letter word, all the words that begin with Q, all the seven letter words, etc.--and actually  don't even know them all, just know the ones that are accepted in the Official Tournament and Club  Word List.  They aren't even playing the game any more, they are just demonstrating memorization  skills.  They sure as heck don't seem to be enjoying themselves, which one would think is a fairly  fundamental prerequisite for a game.<br />In the beginning, Fatsis himself, while he does not hold them up for ridicule or anything like that,  recognizes that much of the story here lies in the oddish personalities who are attracted to this  competition.  But then he too succumbs and gradually turns into the word freak of the title.  The  whole thing is more than a little disconcerting.<br />Whether you're a Scrabble fan yourself, or just looking for a good read, the book is definitely  enjoyable.  But I couldn't help but agree with the sentiment expressed by Alfred Butts's nephew Bob  (Alfred Butts, in case you hadn't figured it out, invented the game) :<br />  He thought he was inventing a game people would play around a card table, like bridge or  something like that.  He didn't quite get the point of memorizing word lists.<br />Neither do I, Bob, neither do I.<br />GRADE : B+en remember a particularly spectacular game or  turn (Personally, I recall when I was 12 and my grandfather, a Federal judge and a a truly brilliant  man, dropped the word MEASLES for the first play of the game, essentially finishing the contest right  then).

But, perhaps just because I'm not British, there did not seem to be  anything presslike about the characters; instead it seemed just a vicious, but worthwhile, savaging of  the sort of amoral, ambisexual, drug-addled, sensation-chasers who are all too common in every  walk of life and line of work these days.<br />Richard Hermes is an entirely minor features writer who has become caught up in the vortex of young  journalists who revolve around Bell, a constant media presence known for bedding any man or woman  he sets his eye on, sort of Larry King crossed with a satyr.  Richard recognizes the emptiness of the  lives the group leads, and still has a sufficient remnant of decency to be repelled by the acts of needless  cruelty that they thrive on, however, he's fallen in lust with Ursula Bently, an icy blonde beauty, who  hangs with this crowd, but whom he compares to &quot;a diamond found in a gutter behind a Chinese  takeaway.&quot;<br />Richard pays court to the intermittently receptive Ursula, and descends deeper and deeper into a  paranoid cocaine-induced haze, in which everyone around him seems to resemble Bell.  He harbors the  improbable hope that Ursula is redeemable and that the two of them can break out of Bell's  gravitational pull to live happily ever after.  But in the end, even as he plans to get away from the City  and Bell, to return home for the Christmas holiday, Richard finally gets his chance to bed down  Ursula, though the experience proves less than heavenly.<br />If the book is intended to say something specific about the press, it escaped me entirely.  No one  actually seems to perform any kind of work in the book, it's all clubbing, drugging, drinking, and  scrumping.  But taken simply as a cautionary tale, a warning that by being with these people you  become one of them and sink into the abyss, it worked well enough.<br />GRADE : Bit's all clubbing, drugging, drinking, and  scrumping.

Jim Chee and/or Lt.  Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police--lies not in details of procedure, nor cleverness of the puzzle  to be solved, nor in particularly interesting characters.  Many other series do these things better.  What  Hillerman really excels at is bringing alive a region of the country, the Four Corners in the Southwest,  and an unfamiliar social milieu, the American Indian reservation.  His writing evokes the rugged  beauty and utter desolation of desert and mesa, and his descriptions of Navajo (and, in this novel,  Hopi) religious beliefs and tribal customs portray a truly fascinating culture.<br />In Dark Wind, Chee must try to solve several cases : the fatal crash of a drug-running airplane; a jewel  robbery; and the repeated sabotaging of a local windmill.  They turn out, predictably, to be  interrelated, and the conclusion is fairly pro forma.  But then there's the almost incidental insight into  Chee's way of thinking, when he's talking to the sister of the pilot who died in the crash :<br />  'Do you understand &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&quot;?'<br />  'I've heard it,' Chee said.<br />  'Don't you believe in justice? Don't you believe that things need to be evened up?'<br />  Chee shrugged.  'Why not?' he said.  As a matter of fact, the concept seemed as strange to him as the  idea that someone with money would steal had seemed to Mrs. Musket.  Someone who violated  basic laws of behavior and harmed you was, by Navajo definition, 'out of control.'  The 'dark wind'  had entered him and destroyed his judgment.  One avoided such persons, and worried about them,  and was pleased if they were cured of the temporary insanity and returned again to hozro.  But to  Chee's Navajo mind, the idea of punishing them would be as insane as the original act.  He  understood it was a common attitude in the white culture, but he'd never before encountered it so  directly.<br />Now Hillerman may or may not have this stuff right, who knows.  And I may think that many of the  beliefs explored are so much hogwash.  But somehow, the books give you the feeling that you're  fulfilling that annoying old college requirement of &quot;Knowledge of a Culture Other Than Your Own&quot; in  the most enjoyable way imaginable.<br />GRADE : Ber before encountered it so     directly.<br />Now Hillerman may or may not have this stuff right, who knows.

But for the final product, the result of twelve years of work, he pared  three volumes of material down to a more manageable 500 pages.  In so doing he has given us what  must surely be one of the best books of popular science ever written.<br />Science writing, if it is to appeal to us unwashed masses, must achieve two very difficult things : it  must render difficult concepts comprehensible to the laymen and it must be exciting enough to hold the  reader's interest. Coming of Age... succeeds brilliantly on both grounds.  Mr. Ferris tells his story as if  it were an adventure tale, the adventure being man's continuing quest to understand the world around  him, which has pushed the age of the Earth and the physical boundaries of the Universe back further  and further, at the same time that the basic matter that makes up the Universe has been perceived to be  smaller and smaller than we first believed.  And yet, even as we've come to realize how much more  complex things are than we first realized, we've nonetheless made extraordinary progress in  understanding them.<br />Meanwhile,  Ferris goes beyond the mere theories and gives us a rich set of portraits of the often odd  men who made the discoveries : Tycho Brahe with his lead nose; Newton practicing alchemy; Einstein  with his various foibles; etc.  Though there must surely be some temptation to demonstrate how  remarkable these men's' discoveries were by presenting them in all their complexity, Ferris mercifully  presents their ideas in terms that we can usually grasp.  If things get a little dicey towards the end of  the book, and the theories become increasingly obscure and difficult to understand, perhaps it is  because they are so new that they have not been thoroughly tested yet.  Perhaps their ugliness is an  indicator that they are simply untrue.  So many of the great physicists have intuitively believed that  when it is finally given to us to understand everything about the universe, the answers will be so  simple that we will wonder how we could have missed them for so long.<br />At any rate, this is a terrific book, filled with the thrill of discovery and the often amusing stories of  the discoverers.  If you are one of the millions who gave up on Stephen Hawking's book, but want to  know what was in it, try this much easier read.  It's got all the same info, but it's actually geared  towards those of us who may not already know it all.<br />GRADE : Ahave intuitively believed that  when it is finally given to us to understand everything about the universe, the answers will be so  simple that we will wonder how we could have missed them for so long.<br />At any rate, this is a terrific book, filled with the thrill of discovery and the often amusing stories of  the discoverers.

In this, her first novel, famously made into a movie by Alfred Hitchcock,  Guy Haines wants to divorce his estranged wife, Miriam, and has finally been presented with the  pretext for doing so, as she's pregnant by another man.  This will enable him to marry Ann and  enjoy his burgeoning success as an architect.  But then he meets a talkative stranger named Bruno,  Charles Bruno, on a train.  Bruno, the ne'er do well son of wealthy parents, wants to get rid of his  father, who refuses to indulge Bruno's lazy but expensive lifestyle.  He shares his troubles with Guy  who in turn makes the mistake of telling Bruno about Miriam.  As fate would have it, Bruno has an  idea for the perfect murder, actually a double murder : two strangers could &quot;swap&quot; murders, each  killing the person that the other wishes done away with, which would make the crimes seem  motiveless, and therefore nearly impossible to solve.<br />Guy is quite naturally put off by the suggestion, though perhaps not as entirely as he should be.  No  matter how much he hates Miriam, the prospect of the divorce blunts his desire to see her dead.  But  when she finds out how important his pending commission is, and that his career is poised to take  off, she decides not to let him go.  Meanwhile, Bruno takes matters into his own hands, quite  literally, and suddenly Guy is implicated in a murder whether he wants to be or not.<br />The book is significantly different than the film, so even fans of the movie will be in for a new  experience.  For Highsmith fans there's all the expected creepiness, from the threatening possibilities  of every day life to homosexual undertones to the plasticity of identity, as Guy has essentially  become Bruno by novel's end.  Whatever depths of depravity she contained within herself to draw  upon, no one has ever written better about the criminally deranged mind than Patricia Highsmith.<br />GRADE : A-ss, from the threatening possibilities  of every day life to homosexual undertones to the plasticity of identity, as Guy has essentially  become Bruno by novel's end.

Right, Sputnik<br />(2) Who was the first man in space ?  Right, Yuri Gagarin (April 1961)<br />(3) Who was the first American ?  You got it, Alan Shepard  (May 5, 1961)<br />(4) The first man to walk on the Moon ?  Neil Armstrong is correct<br />(5) The first Russian ?<br />That's a tough one, huh ?  Well, that's because the answer is : no one.  The Soviet Union never put a  man on the Moon, nor has post-Soviet Russia.  That's right, the whole race to the Moon, that massive,  costly, era-defining program that JFK started, was almost entirely pointless.  The whole time we were  merely racing ourselves.  How can this be ? you ask yourself.  Wasn't this the great peaceful test of the  relative strengths of Communism and Capitalism ?  Wasn't the Apollo 11 mission a glorious victory  for the Free World ?  The answer is that : yes, of course, it was.  It just wasn't a narrow victory.  All  of the edge-of-your-seat drama we associate with the &quot;race&quot; was the product of mass delusion.<br />You see, the dirty little secret of the Cold War--actually it's not little, it's quite enormous in its  implications--is that the Soviet Union was never a coequal Super Power with the United States.  It was  always a backwards, inefficient, bureaucratic, corrupt mess.  It just happened to be the case that both  East and West, conservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats, militarists and pacifists, had  their own reasons for puffing up the Soviet Union, for overestimating its achievements and its  capabilities.  Soviet leaders had to convince their own people that there was some reason for the  squalor they lived in.  Western leaders wanted to justify their willingness to allow Communism to  continue to subjugate all of Eastern Europe.  Militarists wanted money spent on their weapons  systems.  Pacifists wanted to scare people.  Conservatives wanted a bogeyman.  Liberals needed to  believe Communism could work.  Seemingly everyone had a vested interest in the myth of Soviet  power.  Now, normally, the collapse of the Soviet Union would have punctured such a myth, were it  not for the unfortunate fact that Left and Right continue to have their own reasons for maintaining it.  The Right needs the myth in order to burnish the greatness of Ronald Reagan.  After all, if the bear  was really a paper tiger, it diminishes the Gipper's achievements.  Meanwhile, for the Left to  acknowledge the myth would require them to concede that the Soviet Union was a disaster from the  get go, that rather than being a tenable system which Stalin corrupted or which failed to innovate in its  later years, the system was simply stillborn, and even at its moment of seeming parity with the West  was actually quite primitive.<br />Oddly enough, it is in Russia itself that the myth has faced its stiffest challenge.  In his great book  Lenin's Tomb, David Remnick makes the compelling case that it was in large part Gorbachev's  loosening of speech restrictions during perestroika which, quite accidentally, led to the fall of  Communism.  Gorbachev expected intellectuals to criticize the Soviet Union as it existed at that  moment, and thought that this critique would help him to reform Communism.  Instead, dissidents  dismissed the historic tendency to blame all of the USSR's ills on Stalin and attacked Lenin, the  Russian Revolution itself, and the very origins of the Soviet system.  Where Gorbachev expected help  in repainting the edifice, they blew up the foundation of the structure.  And the Wall came tumbling  down....<br />Now comes Victor Pelevin, widely considered to be one of the best of the Post-Soviet Russian writers,  and his short novel Omon Ra is a truly devastating fable of the Soviet Union.  From childhood Omon  Krizomazov, named for the Interior Ministry riot police, dreams of escaping the grim reality of Soviet  life by soaring skywards.  He gets the chance to realize his dreams when he is chosen not merely to  become a cosmonaut but to actually go on the first Soviet moon landing.  But the dream turns into a  nightmare when he is told that he is training for a suicide mission, because the Soviets do not have the  technological expertise needed to bring a landing vehicle back from the Moon.  In fact it turns out that  each space launch consumes a number of lives because every stage of the rocket must be released by  hand, by a cosmonaut decoupling the section he's riding in, because Soviet scientists haven't been able  to automate the systems.  Omon agrees, not that he's really given a choice, to participate in the  deception, as his superiors explain to him that the lie he will help perpetrate is necessary to vindicate  the larger truth of Marxism.<br />This is a marvelous satire, one that is just as subversive here in the West as it continues to be in a  Russia, where a frighteningly large segment of the populace views the Soviet era as a Golden Age.  The writing--for those of you, like me, who frequently find Russian Literature to be impenetrable--is  totally accessible. Think The Right Stuff as imagined by Christopher Buckley.

'I was casting around for a book idea and thought, &quot;There's one -- a comedy  of manners about two billionaires going up the Amazon to the heart of darkness.&quot;'  -Interview with Andrew Yarrow, NY Times Book Review<br />I suppose there's some sense in which it's unfair to hold an author's successes against him, but Christopher Buckley's other books are so good, that this one, though adequate, seems terribly disappointing.

By the end of the novel, he's, you guessed it, on board his yacht in the Amazon on pursuing a Peruvian cocaine kingpin.<br />There are many funny lines and the action is thrilling enough, though it does go on longer than it needs to.

It tells the story, in allegorical form, of Xuan Zang (or Hsuan Tsang), a 7th Century monk who trekked from China to India in search of Buddhist texts, his translations of which were a key to the growth of Buddhism in China.  His real-life travelogue is itself considered to be a great work of literature, but for purposes of the novel he, referred to here as Tripitaka, is given a group of comic companions : the Monkey King, a kind of trickster god, who represents rebelliousness against both heavenly and earthly order;  Pigsy, a marshal of heaven turned into his animal namesake for attacking a fairy maiden, who represents a sort of earthy stolidity; and Sandy, a kind of sea monster, who Waley says represents &quot;whole-heartedness&quot;, whatever that means.<br />The book is intermittently amusing, but even in this abridged version is way too long.  Characters' motivations and the meanings of most of the action are awfully obscure.  And like any picaresque, it is almost purely episode driven, without the various episodes necessarily adding up to a coherent and sustained story.  The book is interesting as a cultural relic, but, if no one told you, you wouldn't imagine it to be such an influential text.<br />GRADE : C	2001-07-07

Either they see the protection of the collectivity as absolutely crucial or they  see the collectivity as being justified only because it serves the development of individual moral  excellence.  So you have the basic question: What is one's social duty?  The survival of the group or  individual moral integrity?  Reason of state or personal honor?  -Henry Adams, Panama<br />I suppose you have to admire Eric Zencey's courage in making Henry Adams the hero of a thriller.  Adams was, after all, an intellectual, best known for not becoming President of the United States--as his grandfather and great-grandfather had--and for his autobiography, which mainly dwells on the lack of great truths for his generation to believe in.  These elements and the fact that the story occurs while Adams is still recovering from the suicide of his wife, Clover, combine to make him a most unlikely protagonist for a mystery.<br />The story places Adams in Paris in 1892, the period during which he was working on his great Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres A Study of Thirteenth Century Unity.  On a visit to Chartres he meets and is captivated by Miriam Talbott, a young American painter.  When her body purportedly washes up near the quai de Valmy, Adams is called on to identify the corpse, but it is not the woman that he met.  He subsequently becomes involved in the scandal surrounding the failure of the French Panama Canal Company, which threatens to destroy the reputations of men like Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal, and Gustave Eiffel, and even to bring down the French government.  Meanwhile, Adams's friend John Hay may or may not be mixed up in the whole mess, though it is certain that he wants the United States to take over the building of the canal.<br />Zencey does a fine job of evoking the time and the place of the mystery.  The blend of fiction and history does not seem forced, and some other interesting historical characters crop up, including Georges Clemenceau and Alphonse Bertillon, who helped popularize the use of fingerprints, which play a key role in the story.  But the very ambivalence--about himself, his times, the truth, etc.--for which Adams is famous, finally makes him an unsatisfactory hero.  Even the most psychically damaged detectives in fiction have typically been driven either, like Sherlock Holmes, by a certainty that mystery will yield to reason, or, like Sam Spade, by a personal code of honor, or, like Batman, by a burning desire to see justice done.  Adams does not have sufficient faith in reason, honor, or justice to be motivated by any of them, he just seems to want to know what happened to the girl with whom he has become irrationally infatuated.  Because we do not share this emotional attachment, the mystery is not as involving as it should be.<br />Instead, the pleasures of the book lie mostly in Zencey's development of Adams's ideas and the portrait of his character.<br />  Adams knew.  But how could he answer?  To a mind as evenly divided as his--a mind, his brother  Brooks had warned him, that would never find a place in politics, where simplicity of vision was  required; a mind to which evil never seemed unmixed with good, nor good unalloyed with evil; one  to which no object appeared important enough to call our strength of action, nor absolutely  necessary enough not to allow that its absence just might be possible to accommodate--to such a mind,  the only accurate answer to bluntness was contradiction: yes and no.<br />This description of Adams's mind is similar to that offered by Louis Menand of some of the other key figures from that generation--Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr; William James, etc.--in his book The Metaphysical Club (see Orrin's review).  One can't help but be saddened that this scion of the family that led the fight for American Independence (John Adams) and against Slavery (John Quincy Adams) succumbed to this kind of banal moral relativism.<br />GRADE : C+ght for American Independence (John Adams) and against Slavery (John Quincy Adams) succumbed to this kind of banal moral relativism. <br />GRADE : C+	2001-07-07

If we forgive Hardy his affection for wine, which we'll assume is a cultural  deal, and a long running relationship, which fortunately never quite achieved Susan Silvermanesque  proportions, he's really quite traditional.  Of course, it helps that Australia isn't all that different from  America, particularly in terms of its cultural heritage.  Corris has written 23 Cliff Hardy books, but  they are not generally available in the U. S., which is a shame.<br />From what I've read of them, O'Fear is a fairly representative entry in the series, which is to say, it's  quite good.  Hardy is hired after an old friend dies in a car accident :<br />  'Barnes Todd has left you some money.'<br />  'Why?'<br />  'To find out who murdered him.'<br />  I sat back in the chair.  Sackville unhooked his glasses and set them down gently on top of the file.  He massaged the bridge of his nose and tried to look grave, but there was a flicker of amusement in  his eyes.  It irritated me, the way a lot of small things had lately.  What's so funny?  I thought.  I'd  been in this business for nearly fifteen years.  I'd found murderers before, hadn't I?  Well, stumbled  across a couple.  'How much money?' I said harshly.<br />  'Ten thousand dollars.  His wife's not too happy about it.'<br />Hardy learns that with Todd's last breath he gasped the word : &quot;O'Fear...&quot;  He recognizes this  enigmatic phrase as the beginning of the name of a notorious, but relatively harmless, scoundrel named  O'Fearna, who is currently in jail, awaiting trial.  His bail just happens to be $10,000.<br />And he's off...sexy widows, unsavory secrets, random corpses, brutal henchmen, crooked lawyers, the  whole nine yards.  But what makes the book a real throwback is Hardy's vulnerability :<br />  ...I had strewn the contents of my wallet across the desk.  I looked at the credit cards and the  meagre amount of cash and the creased driver's licence and suddenly felt small and isolated.  My  only backup in the office was an answering machine; my only means of transport was the Falcon; I  had an illegal Colt .45 and a properly licenced Smith &amp; Wesson .38 for firepower.  No helicopters,  no armoured vans, no shotguns.  Who was I kidding?  This was too big for me.<br />If Corris does not quite have the comedic chops of a Robert B. Parker or a Robert Crais, he more than  compensates by restoring the dramatic tension of a hero who is truly a lone knight, who can be hurt,  even killed, and who has no one he can really trust.<br />This is good stuff, in a classic vein.

Forget for a moment the disputatious issue of whether morality is even possible without God, and consider church as simply a structured environment wherein figures of some learning and accepted authority address moral issues.  Now ask yourself, if many of us don't go to church/synagogue/mosque anymore, and parents aren't in the home much anymore, and schools can't teach morality (because we've banned religion from them), then where do we expect our kids to learn morality ?  Where is the structured environment in which they will be taught, by someone with at least a semblance of authority, the differences between right and wrong ? Of course, as threshhold measures we should do things like re-emphasize morality and ethics throughout the society, cut taxes sufficiently for at least one parent to stay home with the kids, use school choice to allow parents to avoid public schools, allow public schools to use religious-based moral instruction, etc.  But in the meantime, Bill Bennett has created an invaluable tool for parents who want to create such a structure, a McGuffey Reader for the modern age, The Book of Virtues.<br />The book is an anthology of classic stories, essays and poems on moral themes.  In sections on :<br />  Self-Discipline  Compassion  Responsibility  Friendship  Work  Courage  Perseverance  Honesty  Loyalty  Faith<br />Bennett starts with pieces for young children and works up to selections for teens and even adults.  The choices are drawn from a wide variety of sources, with everyone from Hilaire Belloc to Oscar Wilde, P. T. Barnum to Martin Luther King, Chuck Colson to James Baldwin,  being represented.  And the book is enormous, so you can dip in almost anywhere with a high likelihood you'll find something new or long forgotten and little danger of growing bored.  I've frequently found myself searching out the other works of authors cited here, in fact, it was hearing Bennett discuss C. S. Lewis on Booknotes that made me look for and read the inestimable Abolition of Man.<br />It is a curious thing to me that the Left has chosen to cede the field of morality to the Right.  But if you look at comments about this book, or check out some of the alternatives that have been produced by liberal authors, the common theme seems to be that it is inappropriate to teach kids that there is only one, Judeo-Christian, version of morality, and that they should uinstead by taught that there are a whole range of choices that individuals can make when presented with ethical dilemmas, and each choice deserves an equal measure of respect.  This is also the vision which prevails in the public schools these days, which teach that refusal to judge the actions of others is the mark of a well-rounded, worldly, compassionate citizen.  In a moral climate in which they are increasingly taught that it is impossible, or at least inappropriate, to differentiate between &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, is it any wonder that each succeeding generation of children seems ever less capable of associating actions with consequences ?<br />Though not sufficient to counteract these tendencies, only good parenting is truly sufficient, Bill Bennett's Book of Virtues is an effective start towards restoring traditional morality to the center of young peoples' educations.  The premise of the collection--that right and wrong/good and evil exist in the abstract, that kids can be taught to recognize them, and that they can be instructed to choose the one over the other--is apparently now just a quaint conservative idea, but if it is one that you think might still have some value, you owe it to yourself and your family to get the book, read it, and talk about it.  A moral education doesn't just happen, particularly not in the soiciety we've created for ourselves; parents have to take responsibility for seeing that their own kids learn what it means to be a virtuous human being and that they strive to be such.

With the notable exception of the Anglo-American versions, most  revolutions are premised on the belief that the existing structure of society has been artificially imposed and that by altering that structure you can remake human beings and human nature in a new image.  So the French Revolution required that the monarchy and the aristocracy be discarded and expected that egalitarianism and brotherhood would follow, as day follows night; meanwhile, Marxist Revolutions suppose that once capitalism and capitalists are done away with, the happy workers of the world will share and share alike.  Of course, history has shown these revolutionary ideals to be absolutely ludicrous, and such revolutions have come a cropper when the ugly but immutable facts of human nature  have come roaring back with a vengeance.  This creates a rather hilarious situation whereby revolutionaries are continually being surprised by manifestations of the very characteristics which mankind has understood itself to have since time immemorial--greed, lust,selfishness, etc..  Barbara Ehrenreich is not only a socialist, but a radical feminist, which means that besides that Marxist vision, she also believes that once the patriarchy is overthrown, men and women will be coequal and will live in blessed harmony.  This book then is based on her supposedly controversial discovery that the disintegration of the nuclear family, which has generally been blamed on feminism, owes just as much to the political desires of men.  Duh?<br />Just step back for a second and think about Women's Liberation has meant for men.  Basically, women have had to take on more economic responsibilities and more child-rearing responsibilities, while at the same time their mortality rates have begun to more closely match men's and, thanks to abortion of female children and these worsening health rates, their absolute numbers have begun to decline back towards those of men, or even below.  In exchange, men have gotten to slough off economic responsibility for women and children, have been able to get out of child rearing responsibilities, and have gotten much freer access to intercourse with females.  How can Ehrenreich possibly be surprised that men were willing participants in this process ?<br />GRADE : Deconomic responsibility for women and children, have been able to get out of child rearing responsibilities, and have gotten much freer access to intercourse with females.

But Andrew Spielman, a Harvard professor, and his coauthor, Michael D'Antonio, have produced a concise and very interesting volume about the mosquito that is well worth reading.  The secret of their success lies in the fact that though Professor Spielman obviously feels that the mosquito is fascinating in its own right, the book focusses more on the deadly interaction between the bugs, the various diseases they transmit, and humankind.  At a time when the whole Northeast braces to see where birds are dying of West Nile virus, this makes the book quite topical.<br />In a sense, the book has a tragic, or potentially tragic, arc to it.  After some introductory material about mosquitoes, the authors go on to discuss the truly heroic efforts that were made to identify the cause of malaria, and once mosquitoes were identified as the culprits, to combat this pest.  Eventually, this led to a wholesale effort to eradicate the disease entirely, an effort which obviously failed, despite some marked successes.  In this section of the book Spielman is refreshingly forthright about the reasons for the ultimate failures and about what worked and what didn't.  Essentially, success was predicated on : draining water sources that in the past had been allowed to stagnate; installing screens in homes and using netting at night; pouring oil on the standing water where mosquitoes breed; and brief but aggressive use of insecticides, like DDT; made it possible to limit and in some cases eliminate malaria outbreaks in human populations.  It was not actually necessary to wipe out the mosquitoes, merely to deny them easy contact with already diseased humans.<br />But in recent decades a number of factors have combined to deter the application of these techniques.  The most obvious has been the hysteria over DDT and other insecticides, much of it stirred up by Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring.  The wild overreaction to potential problems with the way in which these chemicals were being used fifty years ago has made it difficult to deploy one of our most effective weapons in the fight against mosquitoes.  Problems have also arisen because eradication programs are seen as interfering with the rights of natives and have been perceived as part of the broader imperialist, racist, hegemonic, imposition of Western will on Third World nations.  Also, though the book does not discuss it, the current fetishisizing of wetlands seems as if it must inevitably create situations where human populations are once again living in close proximity to the miasmic waters where mosquitoes breed, a frightening reversal of the long and arduous drainage process that had done so much to limit this kind of contact.<br />Meanwhile, man has continued to expand his reach into the remotest corners of the globe, in the process being exposed to rarer and less well understood diseases than malaria.  At the same time, air travel and shipping (particularly of old tires, as the reader will be fascinated to find out) have served to spread both mosquitoes and these diseases throughout the world.  Such are the elements that went into the appearance of West Nile virus in New England over the past few years.<br />Mosquito discusses this history and the many issues involved in a clear and fair fashion.  The authors avoid easy blame-casting and are generous--perhaps overgenerous--in assessing folks motives, but they make it quite obvious that we've placed ourselves in a dangeroussituation.  After a years long struggle against the mosquito, we seem to be quite consciously ignoring everything we've learned, to have surrendered our most effective weapons in the struggle against one of nature's most potent disease vectors.  The book concludes with a series of eminently sensible steps that we can all take, and steps that public health officials must take, in order for man to coexist with mosquitoes, without putting ourselves at unnecessary and potentially disastrous risk.  Even if most of us will feel that some of the motivation for these measured steps stems from a little to great a respect and fondness for the mosquito on Spielman's part, it is nonetheless true that by the end of the book, he's made a compelling case that, even if we won't all love them as he does, we are likely to have to accept the idea that, however bothersome, they will always be with us.  His suggestions are sensible and moderate enough that it seems like that we should be able to do so.<br />GRADE : B+ves in a dangerous situation.

Let me first say that the author has done a  great job of presenting the story of the drafting of the Declaration and the political milieu out of which  the action arose and of following its fall and supposed resurrection by Abraham Lincoln.<br />However, as near as I can determine the following elements of Ms Maier's analysis were considered  original:<br />(1) unlike Carl Becker, whose classic study &quot;The Declaration of Independence: A Study in the History  of Political Ideas&quot; focused on the ideas underlying the declaration, she focuses on the mechanics of the  legislative process that produced it;<br />(2) she reveals that the Declaration did not actually declare our independence, that had been done two  days earlier, it explained why independence was declared;<br />(3) she's discovered that Thomas Jefferson was not the sole author of the text &amp; the ideas therein are  not solely his;<br />(4) in fact, those ideas were so prevalent that there are nearly 100 other Declarations by the Colonies  and townships that contain similar sentiments &amp; some are even better written; and<br />(5) our interpretation of the Declaration differs from that of Jefferson and the men who voted for it.<br />I'll take these one at a time:<br />(1) As historians look back, one of, if not the only, notable acts of the Clinton years will be the  Welfare Reform Act. It will be viewed as significant because it marks the beginning of the retreat  from the New Deal/Great Society Welfare State. This importance is fundamentally intellectual and  will be written about as such. But someone will surely also write about how the idea was first tried in  Wisconsin and Michigan and how Clinton didn't really support it but felt he had to go along and how  some Democrats felt trapped into supporting it, etc. This is the book that Ms Maier has written--it's  about sausage making, not a look at the sausage.<br />(2) This would seem to be a nod to point one. The Declaration is important for its ideas, not for what  it physically did.<br />(3 &amp; 4) This is exactly the point of Becker's book; that there was a rich stew of ideas, familiar to all  men of the time, &amp; Jefferson and his fellow drafters and the Congress all drew upon them for the  Declaration.<br />(5) Of course our opinions differ 220+ years later. But isn't the genius of Jefferson and the drafters  that they wrote a document that encompasses our evolving views and justifies them still? Isn't it  possible that men who owned slaves &amp; withheld the vote from women &amp; the unpropertied rose above themselves &amp; bequeathed us a document that made inevitable the sorts of democratic progress that  followed? Isn't that why this document lives &amp; breathes today &amp; why we study it?<br />I think the reason that Ms Maier misses many of these points is a function of the same ethos that  created Picasso, Joyce &amp; Alban Berg--the determination to distance their fields from the average  citizen in the same way that science has become distanced through specialization.  The Declaration is  accessible to all of us &amp; we can read it &amp; determine it's meanings for ourselves. So what historians  increasingly do in such situations is delve into the minutiae of the times, &amp; garner information that  none of the rest of us will ever see. Then they turn around and use this &quot;secret&quot; knowledge as a key  which provides them with the unique background to discover &quot;hidden&quot; meanings in events.  This is  largely a hoax, in the same way that atonal music or cubism or free association is; we needn't buy into  it.<br />The genius of the Declaration is that it means exactly what it says:<br />  We hold these truths to be self-evident, That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by  their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of  happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just  powers from the consent of the governed...<br />Ms Maier's book is a valuable addition to the scholarship on the Declaration, but is less  groundbreaking than the hype suggests.<br />GRADE: B+<br />The Declaration of Independence: A Study in the History of Political Ideas (Carl Becker) GRADE: A-ertain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of     happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just     powers from the consent of the governed...<br />Ms Maier's book is a valuable addition to the scholarship on the Declaration, but is less  groundbreaking than the hype suggests.<br />GRADE: B+<br />The Declaration of Independence: A Study in the History of Political Ideas (Carl Becker) GRADE: A-	2001-07-03

For one thing, his stock in trade is  observational humor, which the far less talented Jerry Seinfeld has pretty much beaten into the  ground.  Second, where his profanity and scatology were at least somewhat daring twenty years ago, in  a post-Clinton America where South Park is on TV, Eminem is the most popular pop singer and the  Farrelly Brothers' movies are considered funny, there just is no such thing as public decency any more,  and therefore, nothing to offend it.  What's more, there's something truly sad about an old man, which  Mr. Carlin is these days, who swears so compulsively.  It is particularly noticeable when, as here, the  language is written rather than spoken.  At a night club or in a stage act, surrounded by young people,  maybe it's more appropriate.  But how does a 65 year old sit at a desk and type the infamous &quot;seven  words you can't say on television&quot; quite this many times without feeling like he's making himself  sound like a moron ?<br />Finally, Mr. Carlin seems not to realize that most of the once sacred cows he's attacking were actually  led to the slaughter years ago.  Much of his ire is directed at Christianity and believers, but they have  been so marginalized by modern society that it's like he's beating baby seals.  The shock value of  making fun of God went out with the hula hoop and coonskin caps : for cripes sake, it's been at least a  hundred years since Nietzsche declared God dead--give it up already.  I mean really, when's the last  time you saw a person of faith portrayed in a positive light in any form of media ?  Attack humor is  funniest when directed at the powerful or those with many defenders, but when aimed at the  downtrodden and the thoroughly disregarded it is merely gratuitous.<br />It is a shame that Mr. Carlin, for whatever reason, but one assumes it has roots in his Catholic  childhood, does not realize this, because when he goes after modern shibboleths, icons and causes, he  really is funny, if only because political correctness has made so many of these things untouchable.

And to be honest, he's neither a great stylist (imagine this story in the hands of a Tom  Wolfe or a Richard Ben Cramer), nor is he a profound analyst (though the political and legal  intricacies of this story would require an analyst who combines the acumen of both Ed Rollins and  Bob Bork).  Nonetheless, he is an excellent journalist, and he has a naturally riveting tale to tell.<br />Even though it was only seven months ago, it's easy to forget, or perhaps we (or just I) don't choose to  remember, what a roller coaster ride those six weeks after Election Day were and what emotional  peaks and valleys we all shared.  Mr. Sammon uses an especially effective device to restore the sense  of immediacy that the passage of time may have diminished : he opens most chapters with the actual  experiences of one individual and how events effected them personally.  This is particularly  devastating when he details the stories of Bob Glass, a voter in the Florida Panhandle who turned away  from the still open polls when he heard that Al Gore had already won, and Navy Lieutenant John  Russell, whose ballot was thrown out because it lacked a postmark, even though, as military mail, it  required none.<br />Stories like these serve to plunge us back into the whole mess, then Mr. Sammon lets the course of  events take over, marshaling the fairly complicated facts and presenting them in clear and dramatic  fashion.  The narrative is held together by the theme around which he organizes the book, which, as  the title indicates, that not only was the chaos and uncertainty of this period not an inevitable  outgrowth of a close election, but that Al Gore actually tried gaming the system in order to steal an  election that he knew he had lost, even though he always knew he had practically no hope of reversing  the result.  Mr. Sammon has his own reasons for distrusting Gore, one of which he discusses at some  length.  It was Mr. Sammon who first reported the story that, with the connivance of Gore campaign  officials and local environmentalists, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric officials were ordered to release water  into the Connecticut River in order to ensure a pretty photo op for Gore and New Hampshire Governor  Jeanne Shaheen.  Gore's subsequent dissembling on this issue, if not downright dishonesty, made  Sammon even more skeptical of the Vice President's character than he might otherwise have been.<br />One result of this is that Sammon takes Gore at his word when he said :<br />  I'm not like George Bush. If he wins or loses, life goes on. I'll do anything to win.<br />From this perspective--and though admittedly antagonistic I think it is nonetheless fair--the entire  course of Gore's extremely reckless and potentially destabilizing attack on the Florida election result  takes on a consistency and a coherence that it might otherwise lack.  The conscious attempt to  disenfranchise military voters, the anti-consitutional resort to the courts to settle a dispute which is  explicitly entrusted to legislatures, the vicious smear campaign against Katherine Harris, the  contemplated subversion of potentially &quot;faithless&quot; electors, etc., all seem out of character for an  essentially conservative, rather decent, career politician, unless we first accept his own admission that  he was being driven by pure personal ambition, which Sammon does.<br />There are certain to be many more books about the 2000 Election, but none are likely to beat this one  for clarity in terms both of presenting the facts and developing a simple thesis for why it all  happened.  If you still refuse to acknowledge George Bush's legitimacy and you harbor lingeringcontempt for the Supreme Court, this probably isn't the book for you.

At the suggestion of Lewis Lapham, editor of Harper's, she decided to try to see how folks  moving from welfare to work might be faring and if she could survive on the minimal income  provided by a series of low level jobs.  Allowing herself a small amount of startup money, she went to  Key West, FL; Orchard Beach, ME; and Minneapolis, MN; and found work and a place to live, with a  goal of saving enough by the end of the month to pay the next month's rent.  Her jobs consisted of  waitressing and working as a hotel maid in Florida, working at a nursing home and a house cleaning  service in Maine, and at Wal-Mart in Minnesota.  Her essays about this experience first appeared in  Harper's but are here expanded, barely, to a book length account in which we find out much about  Barbara Ehrenreich, fairly little about the difficult lives of people she worked with, and nearly nothing  about what she would suggest we do to make their lives easier.<br />You see, one of the most distinctive things about the book is that Ehrenreich creates a fictional version  of herself.  She has to minimize her experience when she goes for interviews, has to disguise her true  mission from co-workers and supervisors, has to (mostly) reign in her radical political views, etc.  But  even more, she is a completely atomized being with no family and no friends.  This both makes her  character in the book completely unrealistic and leaves her to spend all her time fixating on herself.  Both are unfortunate.  The lack of friends and family merely serves to point out what an utter  impossibility it is for society to help people who have absolutely no support system of their own.  One  of her main problems is the cost of rent--which must be recognized as a significant problem for a  society that expects people to be able to afford living quarters near the hot economies that are  producing jobs.  But it seems abundantly obvious that rent would be less of a problem if she was  splitting it with a roommate, friend, or family member.  In fact, this is so obvious that her endless  complaining abut her rent loses its effectiveness because we realize how easy a problem this would be  to alleviate.<br />Equally maddening is her refusal to take advantage of the easiest opportunity that exits to find  friendship and social assistance : church.  At one point she actually goes to a revival meeting, but it  turns out she's only there to make fun of the service.  Later, when she arrives in Minnesota, she spends  an evening with a woman who a friend has suggested she look up.  As far as we can tell from the text,  this is one of the few times she spends a significant amount of time, and has a lengthy discussion, with  someone from the social milieu she's purportedly investigating (the rest of the time she just seems to  race back to her hotel room to type up notes).  But here she meets someone who has been on welfare,  has been homeless, has actually packed up her children and moved to a strange city, without knowing  she has a real life she could fall back on if things went badly.  And what is this woman's primary piece  of advice :<br />  'Always find a church.'  People from the church drove her around to the WIC office...and to find a school for her twelve-year-old girl and day care for her baby.  Sometimes they also helped with groceries.<br />But no, Ehrenreich refuses this advice, and its hard to take her complaints about the lack of available help seriously, knowing that her anti-religious sensibilities prevent her from accepting one of the most  readily available sources of assistance.[....]<br />Meanwhile, all we are left with is Ehrenreich.  Ehrenreich at work or Ehrenreich in a hotel room.  The  rest of the working poor are merely a backdrop.  Sure, she's working the jobs that these folks work,  but she's hardly living the life they lead.  She doesn't participate in their lives, neither individually by  visiting their homes or having them over, nor communally by doing the types of things they do in  their off hours.  The occasional comment from these folks that Ehrenreich does share suggests that in  the first place, they are not alone, as she is.  Many live with family, or have spouses or steadies who  work.  And they are not particularly dissatisfied with their lives, nor do they resent their employers.  Actually, most of them seem proud to be working, proud of their work, and proud of the companies  for which they work. [...]Though for much of the book Ehrenreich engages in navel gazing that will only appeal to her hardiest fans, in the closing pages she offers a truly moving assessment of  how she did, and the pride she takes in having, for the most part, succeeded is genuinely effecting. Here is a denizen of the upper middle class basking in the glow of just making ends meet; imagine  how much more powerfully such an achievement must effect someone who has been living on  government assistance for years.<br />So we come to the end of the book and it seems reasonable to expect Ehrenreich to draw some  conclusions about the whole experience and to suggest some alternatives.  But, other than some self  congratulations and a half-hearted pitch for a living wage (estimated to be about $14 per hour) and  rent control, she doesn't bring much to the table.

In the end, we keep coming back, and I hope always will, to the  lone wolf tough guy--no girlfriend, no wife, no boyfriend, no hulking and conveniently amoral  sidekick to do the dirty work, no supernatural cases, no gimmicks of any kind.<br />Within the select group that is still writing these throwback series, there are a few who really stand  out.  Loren D. Estleman (author of the Amos Walker series) is pretty much in a league of his own.  Then, in the next tier, you've got Jonathan Valin (Harry Stoner), Peter Corris (Cliff Hardy), and a  couple more, including Jerry Kennealy and his hero, Nick Polo.<br />In Polo Anyone ?, the second entry in the series, ex-cop, ex-jailbird, San Francisco private eye, Nick  Polo, is hired to expose a suspected card sharp in a local businessmen's regular poker game.  This  proves fairly easy, but he soon finds himself embroiled in a case of industrial espionage, featuring  hostile cops, a seedy fellow private eye, a femme fatale or two, and a rapidly mounting body count.

James Redfield is no exception to this rule.  The Utopia he imagines will have far  less people, will worship old growth trees, and whoever is left over for this epoch will apparently spend  the bulk of their time vibrating (perhaps having attained a state of pure energy?).  Basically, Heaven is  a depopulated place, where we turn Nature into a fetish, and ditch our bodies.  This just is not the  belief system of a person who's comfortable with himself or his own humanity.<br />Sadly, being antihuman is no bar to success, nor to being taken seriously--witness the continuing  academic reputation of Paul Ehrlich--so this book has sold far too many copies and, in a turn of events  that makes one hope that future archaeologists never find a copy of the book, actually made the  Amazon.com list of the Top 100 Books of the Millennium.  In order to save you the agony of reading  this drivel, here are the (first) nine Celestine Insights, as presented by Redfield at his website :<br />  A Critical Mass<br />  A new spiritual awakening is occurring in human  culture, an awakening brought about by a critical mass of  individuals who experience their lives as a spiritual  unfolding, a journey in which we are led forward by  mysterious coincidences.<br />  The Longer Now<br />  This awakening represents the creation of a new,  more complete world view, which replaces a  five-hundred-year-old preoccupation with secular survival  and comfort. While this technological preoccupation was  an important step, our awakening to life's coincidences is  opening us up to the real purpose of human life on this  planet, and the real nature of our universe.<br />  A Matter Of Energy<br />  We now experience that we live not in a material  universe, but in a universe of dynamic energy. Everything  extant is a field of sacred energy that we can sense and  intuit. Moreover, we humans can project our energy by  focusing our attention in the desired direction...where  attention goes, energy flows...influencing other energy  systems and increasing the pace of coincidences in our  lives.<br />  The Struggle For Power<br />  Too often humans cut themselves off from the  greater source of this energy and so feel weak and insecure.  To gain energy we tend to manipulate or force others to  give us attention and thus energy. When we successfully  dominate others in this way, we feel more powerful, but  they are left weakened and often fight back. Competition  for scarce, human energy is the cause of all conflict  between people.<br />  The Message Of The Mystics<br />  Insecurity and violence ends when we experience an  inner connection with divine energy within, a connection  described by mystics of all traditions. A sense of lightness -  buoyancy - along with the constant sensation of love are  measures of this connection. If these measures are present,  the connection is real. If not, it is only pretended.<br />  Clearing The Past<br />  The more we stay connected, the more we are  acutely aware of those times when we lose connection,  usually when we are under stress. In these times, we can  see our own particular way of stealing energy from others.  Once our manipulations are brought to personal awareness,  our connection becomes more constant and we can discover  our own growth path in life, and our spiritual mission - the  personal way we can contribute to the world.<br />  Engaging The Flow<br />  Knowing our personal mission further enhances the  flow of mysterious coincidences as we are guided toward  our destinies. First we have a question; then dreams,  daydreams, and intuitions lead us towards the answers,  which usually are synchronistically provided by the  wisdom of another human being.<br />  The Interpersonal Ethic<br />  We can increase the frequency of guiding  coincidences by uplifting every person that comes into our  lives. Care must be taken not to lose our inner connection  in romantic relationships. Uplifting others is especially  effective in groups where each member can feel energy of  all the others. With children it is extremely important for  their early security and growth. By seeing the beauty in  every face, we lift others into their wisest self, and increase  the chances of hearing a synchronistic message.<br />  The Emerging Culture<br />  As we all evolve toward the best completion of our  spiritual missions, the technological means of survival will  be fully automated as humans focus instead on  synchronistic growth. Such growth will move humans into  higher energy states, ultimately transforming our bodies  into spiritual form and uniting this dimension of existence  with the after-life dimension, ending the cycle of birth and  death.<br />If any of that has even a mild ring of truth to you, by all means read the book.  You and the rest of the  Celestinians are certain to have a grand old time circling the redwoods, sharing your energy, and  vibrating like tuning forks.  The rest of us actually have lives to get on with.<br />GRADE : FEngaging The Flow<br />            Knowing our personal mission further enhances the             flow of mysterious coincidences as we are guided toward             our destinies.

One strain of the story concerns her failed marriage to a mathematician whose unquenched thirst for revolutionary discoveries and their attendant fame drove him to madness.  The second strain concerns the animal research that Hope had fled to Africa to participate in.  Grosso Arvore Research Center is run by the renowned chimpanzee expert Eugene Mallabar, who was just putting the finishing touches on his master work, describing the peaceful ways of our close animal relatives, when Hope's own observations seemed to indicate that all was not quite as idyllic as had previously been supposed among these primates.  But the evidence of aggression that she finds between two competing colonies of chimps threatens the carefully constructed image that Mallabar has built up over the years, and, most importantly, threatens to make the animals less attractive to charitable organizations which fund the project.  Meanwhile, thrumming in the background is a guerilla war which threatens to swamp this African nation at any moment.<br />William Boyd takes these various threads and weaves them together, along with a variety of brief comments on scientific and mathematical ideas and issues, into an exciting and intellectually  compelling novel.  With its Edenic setting and themes of Man's search for knowledge--and the madness the search can bring--the book taps into our primordial myths and some of the core questions of our existence.  If it sometimes seems to be almost too consciously striving to be a serious novel of ideas, that ambition is justified, if not always realized, and the philosophical failures are more than offset by the good old-fashioned African adventure story that unfolds simultaneously.<br />The shelves fairly groan beneath the weight of books warning that when a little of the veneer of civilization gets stripped away in the jungle, Man must face the fact that he has a dark heart.  And there are elements of that here, particularly in the way that Mallabar treats Hope and her discovery, but Boyd has much more to say besides just this.  Perhaps the most exciting message of the book lies in the contrarian stance it takes to the modern age's tendency to romanticize Nature.  It is always well to recall Thomas Hobbes's famous description of Nature as &quot;red in tooth and claw.&quot;  The reader of this book will not soon forget it.<br />GRADE : Ahe has a dark heart.

After all, you write what you know and we wouldn't expect young writers to  know much.  Still, despite their lack of experience as writers and their rather limited experience of  life, these debut efforts are often the best books that the authors will ever produce, sometimes--as in  the case of Harper Lee's classic To Kill a Mockingbird--the only book they'll ever write.  Then again,  there are some cases where the author just needs to get the story out of his system before he can get on  with the rest of his career.  But this is the only case I can think of offhand where an author returned to  autobiographical material for a second novel and managed to improve quite so drastically on the first.<br />Cleopatra Moon tells the story of two Korean-American sisters growing up in the suburbs of  Washington, DC in the 1970s and of their current lives and the strained relationship between them.  Marcy, who now runs a second hand store on an Indian reservation in Nevada, was a bookish,, dutiful  daughter.  Her sister, Cleopatra, who owns a business making gourmet food sauces, was strikingly  beautiful, self-possessed, and daring when they were young.  Cleopatra was the kind of girl we all  went to high school with, who could use her good looks to get just about anything she wanted, and was  surrounded by fawning acolytes who did her bidding.  We all hated such women, but Marcy lived in  utter awe of her sister, of her looks, and of her ability to manipulate people.  This creates a real  problem in the book as we neither like Cleopatra, who is the mystery at the book's core, nor can we  respect Marcy who is so much in her thrall.<br />Added to this structural problem are the Oprahesque touches in the book.  There is the obligatory  sexual assault, and Marcy's advocacy for the White Sky tribe and her belief in spiritual forces add a  treacly New Age/politically correct edge.  Some of the stuff about teen girls dealing with anti-Asian  racism is mildly interesting, particularly because there's so little other fiction dealing with the topic,  but the focus of the novel is elsewhere, mainly on the not very compelling tensions between the  sisters.  Ultimately, we just don't like the sisters enough to get particularly involved in their story.<br />Meanwhile, in To Swim Across the World, Frances Park and her real life sister, Ginger--the two own  a boutique together in Washington--have written a marvelous novel based on the lives and love of their Korean immigrant parents.  The novel is set against a backdrop of first the Japanese occupation and  then the Communist takeover of the North and the ensuing War.  Sei-Young Shin is a young man  from South Korea, his father a woodcarver and a drunkard, beaten down by life under the Japanese.  The great influence in Sei-Young's life is his Grandfather, a churchless minister who surreptitiously  paints the message &quot;Freedom in our land&quot; on local rocks, and continually reminds him :<br />  Your name is Sei-Young, which means 'to swim across the world.'  Someday you will do just that.<br />Heisook Pang is the daughter of a prominent minister in the North.  Her brother is rebellious and  questions how their parents can so docilely accept their oppressors, but her father is devoted to the  Church.  Chapters alternate between the home lives of Heisook and Sei-Young, who eventually meet  and fall in love, but only after both families have been beset with much sorrow and Heisook has  undertaken a harrowing escape from the North.<br />The book is a revelation.  It evokes the awesome struggle of an entire (albeit divided) nation and its  people to live in freedom.  From their days in grade school, when they are required to answer to  Japanese names and are taught nothing of their own country's history, to their meeting in college,  where Communist students are trying to close the Christianuniversity, we see Heisook and Sei-Young  deal with the tragedies of life under the two monstrous &quot;-isms&quot; (Fascism and Communism) of the 20th  Century.

The book starts out as mere &quot;culinary reflections&quot; by a brilliant, arrogant,  pedantic, almost grotesquely loquacious Englishman named Tarquin Winot :<br />  Over the years, many people have pleaded with me to commit to paper my thoughts on the subject  of food.  Indeed the words 'Why don't you write a book about it?,' uttered in an admittedly wide  variety of tones and inflections, have come to possess something of the quality of a mantra--one  tending to be provoked by a disquisition of mine on, for instance, the composition of an  authoritative cassoulet, or Victorian techniques for baking hedgehogs in clay.<br />These reflections, structured around specific menus, and presented over the course of a travelogue, are  fascinating, as they veer off onto obscure tangents, and slyly funny, as Winot completely dominates  the book with his distinctive voice and maddeningly egotistical monologues. But the reader quickly  comes to distrust him and eventually to suspect his motives.  He is after all traveling in disguise, seems  to be following a young couple, and reveals the unfortunate ends met by his brother, a famous artist,  and several others over the course of his life.  These facts, combined with the elitist morality he  espouses, raise some uncomfortable questions about what exactly Mr. Winot is up to here.<br />Unlike Pale Fire or Dom Casmurro by Machado de Assis, in the end there's not much doubt left about  the central events of the novel.  Mr. Lanchester is less interested in preserving the mystery than in the  hugely entertaining character he's created.  Tarquin Winot, even if he is a sociopath, is a very amusing  one.  And Mr Lanchester has rare common sense enough to keep the book brief,  ending the  &quot;gastro-historico-psycho-autobiographico-anthropico-philosophic lucubrations&quot; before Winot's act  grows tiresome.<br />If you always knew the Frugal Gourmet had something to hide.  If Martha Stewart's icy WASP  demeanor has always seemed like a front to you.  Read The Debt to Pleasure and in its deliciously  insidious pages have your worst fears confirmed, about the hideous evil that lurks behind these facades  of condescending homemaking competence.<br />GRADE : A-ne.

Writing is an intensely private process.  I'm  afraid there's no grand philosophical justification for my secrecy.  The desire to know all about an  author is a sign of laziness on the part of the reader.  It's easier to digest a work of literature when  you can attach it to a face, or a set of political beliefs or life-style choices.  When all you have is the  text, or a body of work, you have to confront what is written.  -Horace Jacob Little (Interview with Jake Burnett in the Manhattan Ledger)<br />Journalist Jake Burnett, though fresh out of Princeton, has settled for a job on the Manhattan Ledger :<br />  People considered it an alternative to the New York Press, which was an alternative to The Village  Voice, which was itself an alternative to the mainstream dailies.<br />At a lunch with his editor, a frustrated and drunken man who once showed some promise, Jake is  perhaps a tad too effusive in his praise for Horace Jacob Little, author of stories reminiscent of Jorge  Luis Borges, but a notorious recluse who has guarded his privacy for decades with the determination of  a Salinger or a Pynchon.  The editor, motivated as much by bitterness and professional jealousy as by  the desire for a journalistic coup, assigns Jake to find and profile the author.<br />At the same time, Jake meets an old girlfriend from college, Lara Knowles, a blue-blooded beauty  from Connecticut.  In flashbacks, Jake recalls their relationship and that he once lent her a book by  Little, with whom she too became besotted.  Now Lara asks him to get in touch with, Andrew Wallace,  who she dated after Jake.  Andrew was a brilliant student, but, having undertaken a thesis on Little in  order to impress Lara, began to lose his grip on reality and developed paranoid delusion that Little was  out to get him.  Lara gives Jake a copy of The Confessions of Andrew Wallace, which Andrew has  been writing while receiving treatment at Overlook Psychiatric Hospital in Upstate New York, known  as the Muse Asylum because it caters to gifted but disturbed artists.  In the Confessions, Andrew  describes his theories about Little, most prominent among them that the author's midcareer change in  writing style occurred when another writer killed Little and took his place.  As Jake pursues Horace  Jacob Little, and Andrew's paranoid obsession continues, first time author, recent Princeton grad, and  current medical student, David Czuchlewski uses his very clever plot to ruminate on the relationship  between the author and his public and draws the reader into some delightfully puzzling speculation  about what it is truly possible to know about an author and whether it is necessary to know them in  order to understand what they've written.<br />I suppose I can pay this novel no higher compliment than to admit that it had me quite  discombobulated.  I found a galley proof at a book sale and noticed the positively glowing cover blurb  from Joyce Carol Oates :<br />  The Muse Asylum is an ingeniously plotted postmodernist mystery that introduces a young writer of  exceptional gifts.  David Czuchlewski writes with imagination, vision, and style.<br />That's pretty high praise for a neophyte.  Intrigued, I opened the book and found the explanation in the  author's dedication :<br />  Thanks to Joyce Carol Oates, my teacher and advisor, without whom I would not have started,  completed, or published this novel.<br />That's a common enough occurrence in the publishing world--one of the weekly magazines even used  to track the incestuous world of blurbing, either The New Republic or National Review or someone  like that--but amusing nonetheless.  However, the description of the book sounded interesting, so I  grabbed it.<br />Then I started reading it and got caught up in all intricacies of the story and the mystery of whether  Horace Jacob Little even exists and how anyone can know for sure...  Gradually it began to occur to me  that the whole book might be nothing more than a hoax, an elaborate and ironic comment by Oates or a  writer friend, in which the point was not merely that there's no Horace Jacob Little in the novel, but  that there's no David Czuchlewski in real life.  Art imitates life, imitates art, and so on.  Finally, after a  scene in which a computer whiz friend helps Jake find Little's email address, I too sent an email to that  address, wondering if this might somehow be a game within the game, which a discerning reader was  supposed to figure out.  Suffice it to say, there was no such address.<br />At any rate, it's a terrific novel, especially if it is the maiden effort of a 24 year old medical student.  Which I'm still not convinced it is....<br />GRADE : Ar sure...

Nicholas also happens to be a highly regarded  and quite accomplished novelists, so enough about that.<br />It is often said by those seeking to defend James Joyce that those of us who dismiss him simply don't  wish to be challenged.  But Hopeful Monsters proves that a novel can challenge a reader intellectually  but still provide him with an enjoyable reading experience.  The story, which is actually just one part  of  the Catastrophe Practice series of novels, tells both the story of two lovers, Max Ackerman and  Eleanor Anders, and of the 20th Century.  Max is a young English physics student, who meets folks  like Ludwig Wittgenstein at garden parties, Eleanor a German Jewish anthropologist, whose mother  was a disciple of Rosa Luxemburg.  Between them they meet many of the most influential figures of  their time and contemplate nearly all of its trends and ideas, scientific, political, and philosophical.<br />The hopeful monsters of the title are salamanders that Max raised as a boy and which physically  adapted to their environment, evolving within a generation.  Mosely's hopeful suggestion is that  perhaps there's a kind of Heisenberg Principle for biology as well as for physics and that by observing  ourselves and becoming conscious of the need to evolve beyond our current state, we will influence the  process.  We will evolve to the next level because we realize the need to do so.  Or at least I think  that's what he's saying.  I'm not really sure, but I do know that the novel is a veritable blizzard of  ideas, most of them interesting, some maddeningly elusive, but all of them worth pondering.<br />Even with all this, Mosley never loses track of the complicated relationship between Max and  Eleanor,  In the final chapters of the book he brings them together for a final affecting scene and  manages to tie up most of the philosophical gist of the book (I think).  If you are looking for a novel  that will make you think, but will keep your attention, you can't do better than this one<br />GRADE : Arealize the need to do so.

And let me remind you also     that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.         -Barry Goldwater (1964 Republican Convention Acceptance Speech)<br />If, as Oscar Wilde opined, homosexuality is \\"the love that dare not speak its name,\\" then we might say  that Conservatism is \\"the political philosophy that dare not speak the truth.\\"  Liberals are wont to  bathe the masses in comforting but demonstrably false platitudes, because at the root of their political  philosophy they maintain a series of fictions, like:  (1) we're all essentially equal--all differences in  intelligence, ability, etc. are a function of external factors and these external factors can be corrected  by government; or, (2) all problems, both international and domestic, are soluble by government  action because basically we all really have each others best interests at heart, we just sometimes need a  push from Big Brother to realize it; and so on.  Conservatism meanwhile is based on a set of somewhat  ugly truths, derived from hard experience:  (1) the natural state of man, like that of other animals, is  one of competition, not cooperation; (2) it is because this competition was so brutal, often fatal, that  men reluctantly gave up some measure of freedom, in order to establish a government to protect them  from one another; (3) government, foreign and domestic, is now the greatest threat to man, because  those governments will seek ever increasing levels of control over human behavior; and so on.   Obviously, conservatives are left with a harder sell here.<br />Therefore, while conservative academics express themselves openly, you very seldom hear  conservative politicians present their ideas in simple unvarnished fashion; for the most part it gets  dressed up in warm fuzzy language.  Every once in a while though, especially in times of great crisis,  someone will step forward and actually enunciated conservative values in blunt terms--modern  instances include: Herbert Hoover in his post presidency phase; Charles Lindbergh and the America  First movement; George S. Patton during WWII; Robert Taft after the War; Barry Goldwater in the  early '60s; Ronald Reagan from 1962 to 1988; and Alan Keyes today.   Significantly, most of these  men were either destroyed personally or were denied the opportunity to exercise real power, either by  voters or by party power brokers.  For all the noble cant about how voters wish that politicians were  more truthful, their actions at the voting booth tend to indicate the opposite.  They would much rather  be comforted than confronted.<br />It is against this backdrop that we must consider Barry Goldwater's seminal treatise The Conscience of  a Conservative.  And it is only once we understand these circumstances that we can appreciate how  significant a book it was; in fact, it may be the single most important written work of ideology ever  produced by a practicing American politician of any real stature.  Considered first merely in terms of  the audience it reached, only Tom Paine's pamphlets can be said to provide it any competition for  popularity.  Adjusted for population size, it is probably true that Paine's Common Sense is the best  selling political treatise in the nation's history, but it is also true that Paine, though obviously political,  was not truly a politician, at least not an office seeker.  It is also the case that Presidents and  presidential contenders have written bestselling books dealing with politics, but they tend not to be  ideological.  Instead they are wifty things like JFK's ghost written bit of self serving puffery, Profiles  in Courage, or Nixon's eminently forgettable, Six Crises.  Of course, ex-President Ulysses S. Grant  wrote one of the great memoirs of all time, but he did not even deal with his presidency therein.  The  GOP did issue its Contract with America prior to the 1994 Congressional elections (adocument which  borrowed from Goldwater's book and philosophy), but there was no single national candidate behind  that text.  No, there has really only been one great political treatise promulgated by a single man and  then used as a campaign platform.  For that reason alone, you would think this book would still be in  print and be a subject of academic study.<br />Even more remarkable is the fact that almost all of the book is still topical today.  On the very first  page, Goldwater talks about his annoyance at Republican leaders who feel compelled to call themselves  \\"progressive Conservatives\\" or, as he quotes then Vice President Nixon: \\"Republican candidates should  be economic conservatives, but conservatives with a heart.\\"  This discussion so closely parallels current  Conservative angst over George W. Bush's use of the term \\"compassionate Conservative\\" that it's  almost spooky.  In his discussion of taxes, he comes out in favor of a flat tax in terms that presage  Steve Forbes:<br />    I believe that the requirements of justice here are perfectly clear: government has a right to claim an     equal percentage of each man's wealth, and no more.<br />(Bear in mind that he was saying this at a time when top tax rates went as high as 90%.)  He goes on  to discuss the education crisis--that's right, the crisis in our schools is entering at least its sixth decade  (I assume we would carbon date it around the time of the Sputnik launch).  In the section on the  Welfare State, he correctly forecasts that the dependency of the poor on government largesse would  ultimately degrade them and turn them into virtual wards of the state.  In assessing the now defunct  Communist threat he wisely foresaw that disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union would be a  dead end for the West and that the only way out of the Cold War was to confront the Russians and win  it.  And while the USSR is obviously gone, in a section that could be reissued today by Pat Buchanan,  he concludes by questioning the value of the United Nations, entangling alliances and foreign aid and  demands that we adopt one standard in the area of Foreign Policy:  is the action helpful to the United  States?<br />GRADE: A+	2001-06-11

The  copy of the book I have just happens to include a forward by Burgess, so it seems safe to say that he  did his part to maintain the reputation and readership of this fine book.  And it was heartening to see  that it is still in print.  Heartening because this is a novel that deserves to be read and should have  made many more &quot;Best of&quot; lists.<br />One strange deficiency in the literature of the 20th Century is the relative paucity of novels about  fascism, its attractions and its awful consequences for those who believed.  Sure, there are plenty of  books about the Holocaust, but almost all are written from the victims' perspective.  But while we  have a rich literature depicting the mindset of Communists (Arthur Koestler, George Orwell, etc.),  there aren't many similar books describing how someone, a young idealist perhaps, might have been  drawn to fascism, even Nazism, but then been disillusioned, or even eaten by the revolution they  helped to foment.<br />In at least this regard, Rex Warner's Aerodrome may well be the best novel ever written about  fascism.  The book is a pretty simple allegory--which though the critics I was able to find say was  influenced mainly by Kafka, seemed to me to owe much more to Orwell's Coming Up for Air.  The  narrator, Roy, has grown up in The Village, a bucolic country town with more than its share of  drunkenness, adultery, and incest.  Bordering on the Village is the Aerodrome, clean, orderly,  modern, technological, it represents everything that the Village is not.<br />Amidst a burgeoning mystery over who his real parents are, Roy joins the Air Force, drawn by its  orderliness, attempting to please his girlfriend, and deeply impressed by the rigid but charismatic Air  Vice-Marshal.  The Vice-Marshal is determined to expand the Aerodrome and bring the Village under  his control, remaking it in the same sterile image as the Aerodrome.<br />Roy meanwhile comes to realize that for all the disorder and human frailty on display in his home  town, it is at least alive with possibilities :<br />  I began to see that this life, in spite of its drunkenness and its inefficiency, was wider and deeper  than the activity in which we were constricted by the iron compulsion of the Air Vice-Marshal's  ambition.  It was a life whose very vagueness concealed a wealth of opportunity, whose uncertainty  called for adventure, whose aspects were innumerable and varied as the changes of light and colour  throughout the year.  It was a life whose unwieldiness was the consequence of its immensity.  No  skill could precisely calculate the effects of any action, and all action was dangerous.<br />There, in a nutshell, is the human dilemma : on the one hand we long for a world that would be safe  and predictable and would yield to calculation, but, on the other, such calculations are beyond our  meager mortal powers, so that whenever folks seek to impose order, they succeed merely in  eliminating freedom and stifling progress.  The appeal of fascism--or communism, or Nazism, or all  the other -isms--is precisely that it holds out the promise of having finally invented the human  calculus which will provide security, without any of the nasty side effects.  That this appeal has  always proven false does not seem to dampen the human need for, nor the responsiveness to, such  promises.<br />Perhaps the best aspect of this novel is its timelessness.  Though it is clearly a comment upon the  1930s and 40s, the Village, with its verdant fields, its convoluted genealogies, its interfamilial  murders, and lurking just across the way the orderly utopia of the Aerodrome, suggests Man after the  Fall as much as it does Britain just before WWII.  The themes that Warner is dealing with are  eternal.  That he manages to present them in such a natural and readable way makes the book one that  everyone should read.<br />GRADE : A+hat he manages to present them in such a natural and readable way makes the book one that  everyone should read.<br />GRADE : A+	2001-06-08

Just to add to the  confusion, the book was then rereleased in a movie tie-in version as Ride with the Devil.  At any rate,  it is a brisk, brutal, sometimes funny portrayal of a small band of Southern guerilla fighters, the First  Kansas Irregulars, loosely associated with Quantrill (the Devil of the new title, as in &quot;the Devil knows  how to ride,&quot; a grudging compliment he was paid), as they carry out a series of increasingly bloody  and senseless raids, killing men, women, children, and ultimately each other.<br />The narrator of the book is Jake Roedel, sixteen at its start, a young German orphan, often victimized  by the surprising anti-German animus of his fellow bushwhackers.  Woodrell makes a fairly daring  choice in having the boy commit a brutality quite early in the book, thereby establishing that there is  nothing romantic or heroic about their War.  However, this also puts a considerable distance between  the reader and the ostensible hero, making it hard to care too much about his eventual fate.<br />At least since Ken Burns's Civil War series there's been a tendency to look back at the War a little too  fondly; and, of course, Southerners have been inclined to do so for much longer.  This book offers a  much needed antidote to such silliness, reminding us of just how ugly and wasteful a thing it was, and  of how surely any war degrades into hatreds and killing, no matter how &quot;noble&quot; the cause..<br />GRADE : B-	2001-06-08

In March 1701, Lord Asano of Ako, having been summoned before the Shogun  in Edo (modern Tokyo), was provoked into attacking a corrupt official, Kira, the Shogun's Master  of Ceremonies.  Asano was forced to commit seppuku, ritual suicide, and his lands were forfeit.  His death left his samurai masterless, or ronin , but when they learned that Kira had survived his  wounds they determined to avenge Asano, following the Confucian edict that :<br />  [N]o man may live under the same sky with the murderer of his lord.<br />After biding their time until Kira was in an exposed position--no longer protected by the Shogun's  forces--forty seven of Asano's former samurai attacked his castle (December 14, 1702) and killed  him, despite the almost certain death their actions were likely to bring :<br />  [S]ome people live all their lives without knowing which path is right.  They're buffeted by this  wind or that and never really know where they're going.  That's largely the fate of the  commoners--those who have no choice over their destiny.  For those of us born as samurai, life  is  something else.  We know the path of duty and we follow it without question.<br />Their action proved so popular that the Shogun allowed the forty seven to commit seppuku rather  than be executed as criminals.  Their gravesite, at Sengaku-ji Temple, remains a national shrine;  the story is a staple of Japanese theater under the title Chushingura; and there are several film  versions, including one which was used as WWII propaganda by the government.<br />In Allyn's capable retelling, the story is brisk and thrilling, with a minimum of extraneous  philosophizing or psychoanalyzing.  The action, though terrible, takes on a logic of its own, as the  ronin seek to redeem their master and preserve their own obligations of honor, loyalty, and duty.  The tale and its continuing resonance reveals much that is admirable, but also unfortunate, about  the Japanese character.  You can't help but admire the devotion with which they adhere to their  moral code, but at the same time there is something chilling about the automatic, unthinking nature  of their actions and the degree to which they are influenced by external factors, like how others  will judge them, rather than by internal ethical considerations.  Most disturbing though is the  question of whether this loyalty is a one way street, or whether the masters would be similarly  willing to sacrifice themselves for their underlings, and whether each samurai would so sacrifice  himself for a mere comrade.<br />Obedience, particularly blind obedience, be it to a man or to a code of conduct, is a very dangerous  trait for any culture to glorify, both because it absolves the obedient of moral responsibility and  because it stifles innovative thought.  The same qualities which seem so laudable here and which  have made Japan a homogenous, orderly, productive, and nonlitigious society, have also made it  susceptible to authoritarian government, overt and covert racism, industrial cronyism, economic  stagnation, and have contributed to a culture that is simply not very creative and tends to be too  inflexible for its own good.<br />As a pure novel of adventure, the book is terrific and the insight the story provides into the  Japanese character is invaluable.  Both the book and two movie versions of the story, 47 Ronin and  Chushingura, are well worth tracking down.<br />GRADE : A-ing resonance reveals much that is admirable, but also unfortunate, about  the Japanese character.

Don't phone anything you can talk.  Don't talk anything you  can whisper.  Don't whisper anything you can smile.  Don't smile anything you can nod.  Don't nod  anything you can wink.  -Earl Long, brother of Huey Long and himself a Governor of Louisiana<br />From a distance, it has seemed like Edwin Edwards was either the Governor of Louisiana or on trial  for corruption, or possibly both at the same time, for nearly all of the past twenty five years.  Tyler  Bridges, a former reporter for the Times-Picayune, who covered the successful efforts to legalize  gambling there in the 1990s, has written a thorough account of that struggle and of the political career  of the extraordinarily colorful and resilient Edwards.  In particular, he focusses on the fault line  where the two stories came together, and how the slippery and seemingly invincible Governor was  finally brought down by his eager and quite lucrative involvement in the rampant corruption  surrounding the gambling industry.<br />In so doing, Bridges handles a welter of really labyrinthine information quite adeptly, wringing out of  it a narrative that is relatively easy to follow (though sometimes, quite annoyingly, repetitious).  The  tale is replete with shady Southern con men, mobsters, pols on the take, and features cameo  appearances by well known scoundrels such as David Duke, Eddie DeBartolo, and Bill Clinton.  In  the final section, as the FBI and Federal prosecutors close in on Edwards and bring him to trial, there  is genuine drama : will he slip off the hook yet again, or has the barb finally been set deep enough ?  And as many states face the question of whether to rely increasingly on gambling revenues, instead of  taxes, there's a real object lesson in the dangers they face.<br />For all of that, there's something strangely missing from the story : there's no tragic arc to it.  In that  greatest of all political novels, All the King's Men, Robert Penn Warren used the story of Huey Long  and the miasmic Louisiana setting to explore the tragedy of how essentially decent men could be  corrupted by the exercise of political power, the allure of easy money, and, most importantly, the  self-assurance that even while doing well themselves they were doing good for others.  There is no  moment, let alone a period, in the career of Edwin Edwards where he seems to have been genuinely  concerned with trying to help the core of poor constituents, many of them black, who made up his  base of power.  Nor do his voters appear to have harbored any illusions that he was truly on their  side.  Bridges conveys a real sense that Edwards appeal lay almost entirely in his personal charm and  the natural attraction folks feel toward a charming rogue.  As a result, there are no intimations of  tragedy here, neither that Edwards is a good man whose faults brought him down, nor that this was a  case where deserving supporters had their justifiable hopes betrayed.  Edwards was a crook.  Everyone knew he was a crook.  He did little or nothing to improve the lives of average Louisianans.  They voted for him anyway.  It's awfully hard to avoid the feeling that he and they got exactly what  they deserved.<br />The journalism is, for the most part, excellent--clear, concise, and well paced--and the book is filled  with amusing scenes.  The portrait Bridges paints of the effects of gambling on at least this one state  is truly devastating.  On the other hand, one wishes that an editor had excised some of the needlessly  repetitious material and it's too bad that Edwards was not as tragic a figure as he was comic.  But  these things do weaken what is otherwise quite a good book.<br />GRADE : B-rt Penn Warren used the story of Huey Long  and the miasmic Louisiana setting to explore the tragedy of how essentially decent men could be  corrupted by the exercise of political power, the allure of easy money, and, most importantly, the  self-assurance that even while doing well themselves they were doing good for others.

Munich Found magazine aptly compares turn of the century German author Karl May to our own  Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Both men were quite prolific and immensely popular (May, with over 100  million copies of his more than 60 books in print is the best-selling German author of all time).  And,  just as Tarzan survived Burroughs and remains a significant figure in American culture, Karl May is  survived by his heroes Old Shatterhand and Winnetou.  But an appropriate comparison might also be  made to Gene Rodenberry, creator of Star Trek, because not only do Germans continue to read May's  books and watch movies based on them, they also gather in the thousands to dress up like cowboys  and indians and hang out in teepees and wickiups.  In fact, Lufthansa schedules seven non-stop flights  a week to Flagstaff, Arizona in the Summer, just to accommodate all of the Indianer Club tourists  who travel there to act out their Karl May inspired fantasies.<br />May, whose books combine American West settings with heroes seemingly culled from medieval  myth, was the favorite author of folks as diverse as Albert Schweitzer, Albert Einstein, Herman  Hesse, and Adolph Hitler.  The tales of Winnetou and Shatterhand owe more to romantic epics than to  reality or even to American Westerns for that matter, but it's probably that very fact that makes them  so popular to Germans.  Shatterhand, the nickname derived from his capacity to break the bones of  those he punches, is a young German engineer who travels out West to help with a railroad survey.  There he meets the young Apache princeling, Winnetou, and promises the boy's dying tutor that he  will look after him.  Thus begins a series of adventures which see Shatterhand and Winnetou try to  fend off other tribes and encroaching civilization.  May's vision of the natives is straight out of  Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the myth of the Noble Savage, romanticizing their culture and ethics, and  giving the story an arc of almost Wagnerian tragedy.<br />I recall, particularly when Reagan was president, how the Europeans, who wanted to appease rather  than confront the Soviet Union, would always refer to him as a cowboy, and how in their mouths the  word had a pejorative connotation that made little sense to us ugly Americans.  To read Karl May's  stories is to realize that for European liberals, it was the American cowboys who were the bad guys,  the Indians who were the good guys, and, of course, the ultimate hero was the invincible Teutonic  gone native, Shatterhand.  This is obviously a naive reading of what aboriginal life was like in  America and betrays a fundamental distrust of Western Civilization as a force for good in the  world--not to mention that if there had been any Native Americans in Germany in the 1940's they  would have been gassed, so it's particularly silly to give them a savior who is a Hun.

That he comes achingly close to aiming higher holds out even greater promise for his future efforts.<br />The term \\"high concept\\" refers to the attention grabbing premise of such thrillers.  In this case : David Haines, a religious fanatic whose hatred of medicine fueled a doctor killing spree several years earlier, is about to be executed.  However, a lovely young cancer researcher, Dr. Laura Donaldson, discovers that his blood may contain the cure for cancer.  Despite Haines's hatred of doctors and his genuine religious belief in the sanctity of blood,  the good Doctor gets a court order allowing her to take some involuntarily.  As she's doing so, Haines stages a violent escape.  Now Laura, whose sister happens to be dying of breast cancer, and FBI agent Kevin Sheldrake, who caught Haines the first time around, have to track him down and try to bring him back alive.<br />Oppel handles all of the conventions of the genre with real skill.  Though the coincidences at the core of the plot won't withstand much scrutiny, they are sufficient to drive the plot, and though the story eventually devolves into the predictable gun battle between the principals, there are enough interesting  elements to make the book worthwhile.  In fact, one wishes he'd pursued the other angles. &lt;<br />Kevin's spiritual questing is nicely played off against Dr. Donaldson's agnosticism and her reliance on reason and science, to the exclusion of all else, including much of her humanity.  Even the anti-scientific beliefs of David Haines are taken seriously, with Dr. Donaldson serving as a virtual poster girl for his view of the arrogance of the medical profession.  Unfortunately, Oppel pretty much abandons these plot threads when it comes time for the obligatory chase and showdown.  It's hard to avoid feeling that had the author chosen to give the clash of views among these three greater prominence, and made the thrilling climax a moral and spiritual one, rather than an all too familiar shoot-'em-up, it would have made for a more compelling story.<br />As is, he's written a book that anyone will enjoy on a plane or at the beach.  In the process he's at least raised the hope that he can do better.  We'll have to wait and see if he delivers on the promise, but we'll wait eagerly.<br />GRADE : B-feeling that had the author chosen to give the clash of views among these three greater prominence, and made the thrilling climax a moral and spiritual one, rather than an all too familiar shoot-'em-up, it would have made for a more compelling story. <br />As is, he's written a book that anyone will enjoy on a plane or at the beach.

It will take over, if it can.          -Anne Matthews, Wild Nights <br />This is an always fascinating, frequently funny, but ultimately somewhat disingenuous and hysterical look at the renewed interaction between Man and Nature in urban areas generally and in New York City in particular.  From peregrine falcons making their aeries on skyscrapers to coyotes on the Major Deegan to West Nile Virus in mosquitos to zebra mussels in our waterways, Anne Matthews examines the various ways in which flora, fauna, viruses and climate are impacting the modern urban society in unexpected and frequently dangerous ways. <br />Much of the pleasure in the book lies in just finding out the incredibly varied species which have returned to the Big Apple, and from the substantial proof this offers of Nature's fundamental resiliency.  Less satisfactory is her analysis of why this resurgence of the wild world is occurring and her failure to recognize how easily it could be reversed.  For the most part, Matthews falls back on such environmentalist stand-bys as limitations on pesticide use, disruption of natural habitat and the like.  But the most likely cause goes unmentioned : Man has basically stopped killing these creatures, and so they are ever more prevalent and brazen.   The DDT ban has of course had an impact, just not the one she's talking about.  With the publication of Rachel Carson's scare-mongering bestseller, Silent Spring (see Orrin's review), government reacted by both limiting the use of chemicals to kill pests and by protecting &quot;endangered&quot; species.  It can therefore come as no surprise that there are more bugs, many laden with disease, and more animals, than there were forty years ago.  Even if we don't dismiss the possibility that there were beneficial effects from the pesticide limitations, ask yourself a simple question : if you let people hunt and trap peregrine falcons and coyotes again, how many would there be in New YorkCity at the end of the month ? <br />Though she never approaches this topic directly, Matthews periodically touches on it when she's tossing statistics around.  For instance, the U.S. deer population is now over 20 million, higher than it was when Europeans got here.  Or again, when Massachusetts banned the trapping of beavers, their numbers skyrocketed from 18,000 to 55,000.  Gee, no kidding ?  It can hardly be coincidental that the explosive growth of these populations has paralleled the restriction of hunting and trapping. <br />For the most part, the return of American wildlife has been handled up until now as a feel good story in the national media.  After all, it's pretty hard at first glance to feel anything but satisfaction at having &quot;saved&quot; Bambi, and it was easy for the, as Ms Matthews notes, predominantly urban citizenry to ignore the consequences when they were mostly being felt in rural areas.  But now it's not just the yokels who are being killed in collisions with deer, elk and moose, nor just farmers who have to worry about the predations of wolves, bear, and coyotes.  Now all of these critters are tying up city traffic, colliding with yuppies cars, damming up urban waterways, killing pigeons in front of office workers and housewives, and suddenly, we've got a &quot;crisis.&quot;  It used to be said that a conservative was a liberal who'd been mugged.  Today, a hunting advocate is an environmentalist who's had his car destroyed and his life nearly lost, when two hundred pounds of deer or a ton of moose came rocketing up his hood and through the windshield.  That makes the problem personal in a hurry. <br />Since Man crawled from the muck, he has had but one goal, to vanquish and control Nature.  But in recent years, sentiment and political correctness have made Man a neutral in this battle, if not an actual collaborator with the enemy.  Anne Matthews amply demonstrates the degree to which Nature has taken advantage of this one-sided truce.What's lacking here though is a realization that this state of affairs is unlikely to continue.  Every Biff and Muffy in Westchester County may support the idea of reintroducing wolves out West, but when those deer in their backyards are carrying ticks with Lyme Disease and when those wolves start bringing down the family dogs, it seems extraordinarily unlikely that the Natural world will be able to maintain its current sacrosanct status.  And when the local beaver turn the neighborhood into a government protected wetland, driving property values into the dumpster, government officials won't be able to repeal such regulations fast enough. <br />Projecting endlessly burgeoning animal populations adds drama to the story she has to tell, but Matthews decision to do so seems rather shortsighted.  Similarly, in her final chapter,  she takes the most extreme global warming predictions and forecasts a future for New York, and the planet, that is so dire that it's just not believable, with continually rising temperatures and ocean levels and declining air quality standards.  This overreach is too bad, because up until then she does a nice job of balancing the amusement provided by and the dread inspired by the renewed confrontation of Man and Nature.  But, in these closing pages she goes way over the top, on the basis of fairly sketchy evidence. <br />On balance, it's a very entertaining book.  Matthews at least raises a number of issues which are destined to consume public attention in the coming years and does so with an observant eye and great good humor. <br />GRADE : B	2001-05-31

But A. N. Wilson is less interested in the effect that Christ had on Saul than on the effect that Paul had on the form and content of Christianity.  The Jesus of Wilson's book is a kind of hyper Jew, calling the Jewish people back to a stricter observance of Judaism.  In Wilson's view, it was Paul who turned Christ into the Messiah and turned his teachings into a universal message, accessible to non-Jews.  In essence, Paul becomes the creator of Christianity, perhaps even of Christ.<br />From what the critics say, this is not a particularly revolutionary thesis, in fact, some suggest it is quite hackneyed by now.  It does, of course, require that one accept the idea that Christ was a relatively minor historical figure who was subsequently inflated into a mythical creature by his followers.  Indeed, biographies like this one, or like John Dominic Crossan's books on Jesus, by their very nature are intended to drain Christ and Christianity of any divinity.  By seemingly impartial resort to various texts and the historical record, and the raising of inconsistencies and obvious inaccuracies in the Biblical record, they seek to cast all into doubt.  But these books have a curious defect, their inability to explain things much better than the Bible does, and the necessarily speculative nature of their attempts to reconstruct what &quot;really&quot; happened, is so unsatisfactory that they can't truly compete effectively with the original sources they seek, whether explicitly or implicitly, to debunk.<br />Even if the reader is perfectly willing to accept the notion that Christ never claimed to be the Son of God and that Saul never experienced his alleged vision on the road to Damascus, the author who wishes to dismiss it had better be able to replace it with an equally compelling story of why Saul became Paul.  Because A. N. Wilson has no such competing vision and because his critique is so random--drawing upon sources when they help his case, ignoring them when they don't, attacking them when they contradict him--it has the paradoxical effect of making the original look good by comparison.  After all, given two dubious versions of Paul's life, the Bible's and Wilson's, why wouldn't we choose the more awesome one, the one which has inspired Western Civilization for two thousand years ?<br />Wilson is a fine writer and he ranges across an impressive number of topics.  He appears to have done yeoman's work in sifting through the rather voluminous research on Paul and early Christianity.  The book is lively and interesting and readable.  It just isn't particularly convincing.  Having gone to such great lengths to try and show that we must be suspect of the historical version of the physical events of his life, it was perhaps foolish to try to recreate his psychology and the life of his mind.<br />GRADE : B-because his critique is so random--drawing upon sources when they help his case, ignoring them when they don't, attacking them when they contradict him--it has the paradoxical effect of making the original look good by comparison.

In so doing, he raises fascinating questions about how we would react to miracles, were we to witness them, and about why those miracles might occur.<br />In 1906, seventeen year old Mariette Baptiste enters an upstate New York convent, joining the order of The Sisters of the Crucifixion.  Pretty, pious, and personable, she quickly becomes the darling of the place, even though these same traits, and the fact that the Mother Superior is her sister, inspire some jealousy and even forbidden lusts.  Since her confirmation, at age thirteen, Mariette has had a calling and has heard the voice of Christ speaking to her, preparing her for some great events.  So she, and some of the nuns who love her, are prepared when, upon the death of her sister, Mariette is afflicted with stigmata.  But others, particularly those who have resented her anyway, are less willing to accept the miraculous nature of these happenings, suspecting Mariette of an attention-seeking hoax.  And when the wounds are healed just as suddenly as they appeared, both sides see this as confirmation of their own, very divergent, beliefs.<br />Hansen recreates the atmosphere and daily life of the convent in convincing detail.  He allows the remarkable occurrences to speak for themselves for the most part, and allows just enough wiggle room for more dubious readers to question whether Mariette is a saint or a charlatan.  One of the most unlikely facets of the story, for a believer, is that this young girl in the middle of nowhere would be chosen as the recipient of these manifestations of God's presence.  Equally perplexing is why these signs should be made so ambiguous and left open to doubt.  Hansen answers these questions as Mother Saint-Raphael explains to Mariette why, even though she personally believes in Mariette, she is willing to let the matter be dismissed by church officials :<br />  Skeptics will always prevail.  God gives us just enough to seek Him, and never enough to fully find  him.  To do more would inhibit our freedom, and our freedom is very dear to God.<br />This idea, that God purposely leaves the decision of whether to have faith in the hands of men, rather than to force them to believe, is fundamental to the view of Man as having Free Will.  Of course, it can also be easily ridiculed as an easy way out of ever proving God's existence.  Regardless of which side of the argument you come down on, this is a beautiful, thought-provoking, novel about the awesome power, and the inevitable limits, of faith.<br />GRADE : A+he story, for a believer, is that this young girl in the middle of nowhere would be chosen as the recipient of these manifestations of God's presence.

This is most obvious from the way that Shaw changes the ending of the classic myth from which he borrows the plot and title and by his referring several times to Henry Higgins as Miltonic.  The original Pygmalion was a character in Ovid's Metamorphoses, a woman-hating sculptor who chiseled a perfect female out of stone.  He became so enamored with his creation that he asked the gods to grant her life.  Venus answered his prayers, turning the statue into a living woman, Galatea, whom Pygmalion then married.<br />In his version of the Pygmalion tale, Shaw eschews this happy ending and, whether wittingly or no, turns the story into a Biblical allegory.  Henry Higgins takes the role of God :<br />  You see this creature with her kerbstone English: the English that will keep her in the gutter to the  end of her days. Well, sir, in three months I could pass that girl off as a duchess at an ambassador's  garden party. I could even get her a place as lady's maid or shop assistant, which requires better  English. Thats the sort of thing I do for commercial millionaires. And on the profits of it I do  genuine scientific work in phonetics, and a little as a poet on Miltonic lines.<br />Lifting Liza--who it must be noted is a flower girl, deriving her living from the products of the garden, get it?--up from the gutter (note the implication that she is dirt), Higgins turns her into a cultured woman, remakes her in his own image, only to find himself taken with his creation.  He finds that he has not merely given her form, but has revealed a worthwhile soul too :<br />  HIGGINS [arrogant] I can do without anybody. I have my own soul: my own spark of divine fire.  But [with sudden humility] I shall miss you, Eliza. [He sits down near her on the ottoman]. I have  learnt something from your idiotic notions: I confess that humbly and gratefully. And I have grown  accustomed to your voice and appearance. I like them, rather.<br />  LIZA. Well, you have both of them on your gramophone and in your book of photographs. When  you feel lonely without me, you can turn the machine on. It's got no feelings to hurt.<br />  HIGGINS. I cant turn your soul on. Leave me those feelings; and you can take away the voice and  the face. They are not you.<br />But this is not the same thing as love, and Liza wishes to be loved, resulting in an impasse between the two :<br />  LIZA. What did you do it for if you didnt care for me?<br />  HIGGINS [heartily] Why, because it was my job.<br />  LIZA. You never thought of the trouble it would make for me.<br />  HIGGINS. Would the world ever have been made if its maker had been afraid of making trouble?  Making life means making trouble. Theres only one way of escaping trouble; and thats killing  things. Cowards, you notice, are always shrieking to have troublesome people killed.<br />  LIZA. I'm no preacher: I dont notice things like that. I notice that you dont notice me.<br />  HIGGINS [jumping up and walking about intolerantly] Eliza: youre an idiot. I waste the treasures  of my Miltonic mind by spreading them before you. Once for all, understand that I go my way and  do my work without caring twopence what happens to either of us. I am not intimidated, like your  father and your stepmother. So you can come back or go to the devil: which you please.<br />Liza ultimately chooses independence from her creator and marries the dull but earnest Freddy.  As Shaw said in a postscript which was added to later editions :<br />  Galatea never does quite like Pygmalion: his relation to her is too godlike to be altogether  agreeable.<br />And so you have it : God creates a creature in his own image, and is pleased with it, but wishes it to remain wholly His.  The creature, created too well, wants its independence, more than it wants to bask in the reflected glow of the Creator, and so rebels. Odd as it may seem, coming from a Socialist and an Atheist, Shaw's Pygmalion is a devoutly Biblical work, derived entirely from the most classic themes in Western thought.<br />In addition, though we try to avoid psychology as much as possible here, there are inevitable comparisons to Shaw's own life.  Read Higgins as a stand-in for Shaw, bringing culture to the unwashed masses (his Adams and Eves, Galateas, and Lizas) through his advocacy of Socialism.  However, this process will not create any love between him and the objects of his endeavor.  Instead, he will wish them to remain true to his vision of what they should be, and they will resent their creator and seek their independence from the life he envisions for them.  Looked at from this perspective, the play reflects the uneasy relationship between intellectuals and the intended beneficiaries of their theories.<br />At any rate, you can interpret the play on a number of levels, it has several memorable characters and it's quite funny, probably the greatest work of a Nobel laureate.  One recommendation : because of the reliance on language and dialects, you really need to hear it, rather than just read it.

1978498:US	52173832	R3GPTTJPA15ZZX	0805067205	280975572	Balsamic Dreams: A Short But Self-Important History of the Baby Boomer Generation	Books	4	43	68	N	N	funny, but disappointing	Considering how minuscule were the circulations of both Spy and Movieline, the magazines for which he wrote, I would imagine that most folks were first exposed to Joe Queenan, as I was, on Imus in the Morning.  He's absolutely hilarious there : his sarcastic style is ideally suited to the format and he's got Imus continually directing him to new topics at which to spew venom.  But after reading several of his books--all of which I've liked, but not loved--I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't need a better editor to bring some form to his very funny observations.<br />Queenan's latest book, Balsamic Dreams, is intended to be an indictment of the Baby Boomer Generation, of which he is an embarrassed member.  He's operating in what Norman Schwarzkopf might call a target rich environment here, and almost inevitably much of what he has to say is very amusing, even laugh-out-loud funny in places.  But somehow, it's not as good a book as it should be.<br />There are a couple of problems.  For one thing, he's really written a series of interconnected essays rather than one sustained indictment.  This makes for some rather distracting disorganization and some truly annoying repetition.  Worse, he periodically himself gets distracted from the task at hand.  I thoroughly enjoyed his attacks on the so-called Greatest Generation and on Gen-X, but in these sections of the book he's essentially defending the Boomers, rather than garroting them, which is what we'd prefer.<br />The other problem isn't so much structural, it's ideological.  Queenan's thesis is that the Boomers started out well, but then sold out.  He repeatedly gives them credit for \\"the Freedom Riders. Woodstock, Four Dead in Ohio, driving Nixon from office, Jon Voight in Midnight Cowboy\\", but then says that after that they became selfish, self-absorbed, and obsessed with their material well being.  Which is all well and good, except that : Midnight Cowboy \\"\\"; as he himself says, the Boomers as they exist in our minds are the sons and daughters of the Post-WWII white middle class, and as such weren't a significant part of the Civil Rights movement; Woodstock was the epitome of the generation's irresponsible self-indulgence which was then conflated into some kind of meaningful statement of peace, love, and brotherhood; and both driving Nixon from office and getting gunned down at Kent State were fundamentally related to their desire to avoid service in Vietnam, which, though Queenan largely avoids the topic, is the primary crime they have to answer for.  Basically, he's completely wrong about whether his generation was ever worthwhile, and this too seems a function of his natural inclination to defend his own : the Boomers didn't decline over time, they began badly.<br />Oddly enough, the best moments in the book come when Queenan is making serious points, rather than comic ones.  At one point, when discussing the total farce that Boomers have turned funerals into, with songs, multiple insipid eulogies, and readings from inane fare like the Tibetan Book of the Dead, he says that :<br />  Because we Baby Boomers believe in nothing, we end up acting like we believe in everything.<br />Elsewhere, while visiting a dying friend, Queenan is approached by a woman he doesn't know who clearly wants to hug him, but avoids her :<br />  After an awkward silence, she spoke : 'It's a shame that men have so much trouble showing their<br />  emotions,' she whispered.  It was classic Baby Boomer feminism.  What she meant was : 'You  probably have the same feelings that I do, but you can't possibly show them, because that would<br />  necessitate revealing your feminine side, which this hideously repressive society prohibits you from  doing.'  It was also classic Baby Boomer behavior in that it capitalized on an inappropriate,  emotionally devastating moment to launch a skirmish in the ongoing gender wars.<br />  'Actually, I have no trouble showing my emotions,' I told her.  'These are my emotions.  I'm sad<br />  that my friend is dying, and that's why I look so sad.  If my friend wasn't dying, I would probably  be smiling and look a lot happier.  I think a lot of men work this way.'<br />  'Have a nice life,' she replied.<br />  Ditto.<br />Even here though, when he's truly nailed what's most wrong with the Baby Boomers, he fails to develop these observations into a unified and coherent brief against them, because his objections seem to be mostly stylistic, rather than moral.  He seems more concerned with how cheesy the funerals are and how silly the hugging is, than with the underlying causes of these behaviors.  But the Baby Boomers aren't evil because they are gauche or tacky or melodramatic; they're evil because they don't believe in anything but themselves and as Queenan says when discussing Bill Clinton's capacity to show empathy without ever actually sharing a feeling, \\"...they don't actually care what other people do as long as they say the right things....\\"<br />There is an essential hollowness at the core of this generation.  The fact that they have no beliefs, the way they display emotion without feeling it, the way they tried to turn simple draft avoidance into a great crusade, the way they have warped social standards to indulge their behaviors, ...all of these these things should be piled one on top of another by the prosecution as it makes its case that they are the most destructive generation in history.  But Queenan, notorious for his scorched earth style and willingness to take no prisoners, backs off, and the book suffers because of it.<br />It's too bad, because there's much here that's funny and wickedly observant, and with a stronger editor to keep him on track, the book might have been great.  As is, it's fun, but somewhat disappointing.<br />GRADE : B-told her.  'These are my emotions.  I'm sad<br />    that my friend is dying, and that's why I look so sad.

The sentry hesitated, looking over his shoulder as the light behind him grew more intense.  It faded  within a few seconds, but its pale sheen covered everything within the stadium, the looted furniture  in the stands, the cars behind the goal posts, the prisoners on the grass.  They were sitting on the  floor of a furnace heated by a second sun.  -Empire of the Sun<br />Time was when the great war books were written either by the combatants themselves or by  historians.  But it is uniquely the case of WWII--and uniquely a function of the fact that it was truly a  &quot;World&quot; war--that two of the greatest, and certainly the most affecting, works of literature to emerge  from the war relate the experiences of children.  Anne Frank's Diary, though the War itself is  necessarily off stage, is informed by our knowledge of its events, and her perilous situation is a result  of the War.  In Empire of the Sun, our young hero--Jamie, later Jim--is thrust into the very midst of  war, and, though he's rarely in the middle of combat, the killing and other horrors (even down to the  A-bombing of Japan, which gives the book its unexpected meaning) occur all around him.<br />J. G. Ballard has drawn upon his own four years in the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center, near  Japanese occupied Shanghai, the imaginative and visual techniques of his science fiction writing, the  heritage of such writers as Charles Dickens and Mark Twain, and a dark, but accurate, personal vision  of WWII as little more than a prelude to WWIII, to create a novel that captures the bloody-minded  nature of the 20th Century as no other author has.  Particularly impressive is the way in which he  shows that, for young Jamie, the War is, perversely, something of a liberation, freeing him from the  normal strictures of the adult world.  He's kind of like Huck Finn lighting out for the Territories, but  in his case there's not even a runaway slave for a companion.<br />Ballard is also very conscious of the way in which modern media has served to minimize reality, or at  least to distance us from it.  After the War ends, Jim is watching newsreels and realizes that they are  part of what will become the accepted version of events, with arrows sweeping across continents,  while the true life experiences of people like him will take on the quality of illusions.  In turn, Ballard  makes many of the scenes almost hallucinatory or surreal (it's hard to convey just how visual the  novel is; suffice it to say that it is so cinematic that even Steven Spielberg made a reasonably  satisfying movie version out of it.)<br />Ultimately, it is Jim's triumph, and China's, to have survived WWII.  As the novel closes and he heads  to England to complete school, Jim seems uncertain whether he'll survive WWIII, but positive that  China, prostrate for so long, will wreak a horrible vengeance upon the world.  This novel comes as  close as any can to summing up what was one of the central themes of the 20th Century : The  Slaughter of the Innocents.  Jim is in many ways the archetypal hero of the age, a worthwhile  representative of those who survived the Slaughter.  Anne Frank, tragically, represents all those who  did not.<br />GRADE : A+om the  normal strictures of the adult world.

What we are witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or a passing of a particular period of  postwar history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological  evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human  government.  -&quot;X&quot; (Francis Fukuyama), The End of History? (The National Interest)<br />One assumes that only George F. Kennan's &quot;Containment&quot; memo, likewise published under the  pseudonym &quot;X&quot;, can rival Francis Fukuyama's essay &quot;The End of History&quot;--first published in 1989, in  The National Interest--in terms of impact on the public consciousness of a foreign policy brief.  Fukuyama's essential argument was not that history, in terms of events and conflicts and the like, had  actually come to and end, rather that liberal capitalist democracy represented the final step in Man's  political evolution.  With its overtones of Cold War triumphalism, the piece set off a huge kerfuffle  and turned a State Department cypher into a significant political philosopher almost overnight.<br />In this book, Fukuyama expands on the ideas in his original essay and introduces several new ones,  the most important of which, embodied by the idea of &quot;thymos&quot;, is that the greatest threat to the End  of History is the fact that people demand recognition.  By recognition, he means something fairly  broad, but which we all intuitively recognize :<br />  ...that part of man which feels the need to place value on things--himself in the first instance, but  on the people, actions, or things around him as well.  It is the part of the personality which is the  fundamental source of the emotions of pride, anger, and shame, and is not reducible to desire, on  the one hand, or reason on the other.  The desire for recognition is the most specifically political  part of the human personality because it is what drives men to want to assert themselves over other  men... .<br />Liberal democracy succeeds brilliantly at fulfilling Man's basic desires--food, clothing, shelter--but it  raises several questions.  Will Man, once satiated, still have the kind of thymos which has driven the  species to achieve technologically and culturally ?  Will the most able in society be content to be  treated equally with those they consider their inferiors, or will they demand a level of political  recognition commensurate with their contributions to society ?  Will those at the bottom of the social  scale--and liberal democracy does, undeniably, produce a hierarchy from poor to rich--be content to  have less than those at the top of the scale, or will they demand that the high be brought low ?  Fukuyama seeks to provide answers to these questions, drawing upon thinkers like Plato, Kant, Hegel,  Marx, Nietzsche, and Alexandre Kojeve, and upon the experiences of modern times.<br />The book is always fascinating, sometimes wrongheaded and frequently brilliant.  In the end, the  question that animates the discussion is the same that mankind always faces ; which will ultimately  triumph, the desire for security or the urge to freedom.  There is no more important issue in human  history and the ways in which we answer it will, as always, determine our future.  Even if he does not  arrive at any final answers, Fukuyama adds immeasurably to our understanding of the question and its  importance.<br />GRADE : A+.<br />Liberal democracy succeeds brilliantly at fulfilling Man's basic desires--food, clothing, shelter--but it  raises several questions.

It is this which explains the Left's strange silence as  regards what we might otherwise expect to hear them attack as a savage and unnatural product of  military-industrial capitalism.  Fortunately for the Left, the accession of Richard Nixon to the  presidency in 1968 has allowed them to disown Vietnam, turning it into the one conflict that has truly  been diminished in the public eye.  Meanwhile, patriotism, even nativism, is such a powerful force on  the Right that conservatives have been reluctant to question these righteous and glorious causes.  These factors have combined to create an artificial national consensus about American involvement in  a series of bloody and quite senseless wars.<br />At last though, in the past few years--not coincidentally following the Cold War and the end of its  dissent stifling effects--conservative historians have finally begun to produce a coherent and fairly  unified critique of the century's great wars and of American (and British) participation in them.  The  liberating winds of  these new circumstances have allowed folks to take a fresh look at a myriad of  issues, allowed for A. Scott Berg's rehabilitation of Charles Lindbergh,  permitted even standard issue  histories like David Kennedy's Freedom from Fear to at long last acknowledge the utter failure of the  New Deal, allowed the nation to finally accept responsibility for the incarceration of  Japanese-Americans, and so forth. But most importantly, it has led to  a series of books on the  threshold issue of whether fighting the wars was in our national interest to begin with.  For instance,  Pat Buchanan's A Republic not an Empire, though it was rather harshly denounced, raised important  questions about whether it made sense for the U. S. to get involved in WWII.  Niall Ferguson's Pity  of War performs much the some service for British participation in the First World War, and was, not  surprisingly, greeted with nearly equal vitriol.<br />Really more of an extended analytical essay than a history of the War, Ferguson sets out to answer a  series of ten questions :<br />  (1)  Was the war inevitable, whether because of militarism, imperialism, secret diplomacy or the  arms race?<br />  (2)  Why did Germany's leaders gamble on war in 1914?<br />  (3)  Why did Britain's leaders choose to intervene when war broke out on the Continent?<br />  (4)  Was the war, as is often asserted, really greeted with popular enthusiasm?<br />  (5)  Did propaganda, and especially the press, keep the war going...?<br />  (6)  Why did the huge economic superiority of the British Empire not suffice to inflict defeat on  the Central Powers more quickly and without American intervention?<br />  (7)  Why did the military superiority of the German Army fail to deliver victory over the British  and French armies on the Western Front, as it delivered victory over Serbia, Rumania and  Russia?<br />  (8)  Why did men keep fighting when, as the war poets tell us, conditions on the battlefield were  so wretched?<br />  (9)  Why did men stop fighting?<br />  (10)  Who won the peace--to be precise, who ended up paying for the war?<br />Because his answers to these questions are so uniformly at variance with the accepted version of  history, Ferguson concludes that Britain's entry into the War was &quot;nothing less than the greatest error  of modern history.&quot;  He argues that Germany had no global war aims, that she would have certainly  won the war, but would have done little more than establish the same type of European tradeunion  that modern Germany is rapidly creating.  And given what Britain gave up, in terms of Empire, lives,  and economic retardation, the war must therefore be seen as a complete waste.<br />I agree with those conclusions, but think he may actually be too timid in his argument.  One of the  criticisms of his analysis has been that Germany had wider aims and would have eventually confronted  Britain.  This seems almost absurd.  Unless the other nations of Europe had truly collaborated with  their conqueror it is hard to imagine how Germany could have even effectively held onto them, never  mind turn and attack Britain while also subjugating the entire population of Europe.<br />There's also one strain that runs through the questions he asks, that I would have liked to see him  address--the effect of democracy.  It has long been assumed that democracy would tend to be more  pacific than other forms of government : how then explain the nearly continuous state of war that the  two great democracies, Britain and America, found themselves involved in during the 20th Century ?  There would seem to be a series of interlocking causes, all functions of democracy, which contributed  to this unlikely state of affairs.  First, democracies are more unlikely to get involved in warfare in the  first place.  Opposing systems well understand this fact and are able to exploit it, so that they arm and  strengthen themselves while democracies stand idly by and do nothing.  If Britain really did have  something to fear from German naval, colonial, and continental ambitions, the time to deal with  Germany was twenty or more years earlier, when she was still weak.  Similarly, Nazi Germany,  Imperial Japan, the Soviet Union, Red China, etc., were all allowed to build themselves into serious  military powers because Britain and America, their leaders beholden to the will of the people, did not  stop them.<br />Second, when war finally does come, it is precisely because it is a democratic decision that our soldiers  are likely to go right on fighting even in squalid and lethal conditions.  It is the totalitarian powers  which tend to have their armed forces quit on them, because, in some sense, it simply isn''t their fight.<br />Finally, the political and cultural dynamics of democracy require that every war the nation enters into  be glorified and sanctified, because it was the will of the people.  This means that democracies are  nearly incapable of learning any lessons from these conflicts.  To acknowledge that the war was a  mistake would perhaps be too traumatic to the polity for such apostasy to stand.  Thus, for all the  cheap talk of &quot;no more Munichs&quot; the West does nothing even today as China tries to turn itself into a  superpower, despite the obvious fact that their power will be aimed directly at us.<br />The only remaining question, raised by books like this one and Pat Buchanan's and the ones that will  eventually be written about the futility of the Cold War and the Gulf War, is whether when the next  war comes, the democracies (by which we really only mean Britain and America) will have sense  enough to stay out of it.  If enough people read and comprehend The Pity of War, we just might.<br />GRADE : A+nly  won the war, but would have done little more than establish the same type of European trade union  that modern Germany is rapidly creating.

To acknowledge that the war was a  mistake would perhaps be too traumatic to the polity for such apostasy to stand.  Thus, for all the  cheap talk of &quot;no more Munichs&quot; the West does nothing even today as China tries to turn itself into a  superpower, despite the obvious fact that their power will be aimed directly at us.  <br />The only remaining question, raised by books like this one and Pat Buchanan's and the ones that will  eventually be written about the futility of the Cold War and the Gulf War, is whether when the next  war comes, the democracies (by which we really only mean Britain and America) will have sense  enough to stay out of it.

Well, let me just briefly try to convince you that you do want to.  First of all, Heather  Pringle is a terrific writer.  This is popular science writing as it should be done, witty, interesting and  accessible.  Second, the mummies themselves are fascinating.  Though we tend to think of just the  Egyptians and old horror movies (which, amazingly enough, she was not a fan of as a youth), a wide  range of cultures--including our own, as Pringle shows in the very amusing final chapter--have been  obsessed by the idea of preserving the body even after death.  The mummies offer her the opportunity  to look into each of these cultures and into a variety of topics, including disease, murder, drugs and  other equally juicy matters.  Finally, the scientists and researchers who study the mummies are a  colorful and interesting group in their own right and Pringle, though sympathetic to them, has a good  sense of what makes them entertaining.  Just trust me on this one; read the book; it's great fun.<br />GRADE : A-	2001-05-23

Familiar to most readers via her Ripley books and Strangers on a Train, Patricia Highsmith specialized  in creepy portraits of sociopaths as their paths crossed and destroyed the lives of ordinary folk.  This  less well known little gem starts out innocently enough with a wealthy Manhattan couple and their  missing dog, but gets ugly fast as the dognapper proves to be obsessed with teaching them a lesson and  the young cop investigating the case turns out to be equally obsessed with protecting the couple and  imposing justice.<br />With the kooks on both sides of the law this time there's an even more claustrophobic effect, as she  shows just how frightening the people around us may be and how dangerous every day life is, but it's  all offset by a dark sense of humor.

It will take over, if it can.  -Anne Matthews, Wild Nights<br />This is an always fascinating, frequently funny, but ultimately somewhat disingenuous and hysterical  look at the renewed interaction between Man and Nature in urban areas generally and in New York  City in particular.  From peregrine falcons making their aeries on skyscrapers to coyotes on the Major  Deegan to West Nile Virus in mosquitos to zebra mussels in our waterways, Anne Matthews examines  the various ways in which flora, fauna, viruses and climate are impacting the modern urban society in  unexpected and frequently dangerous ways.<br />Much of the pleasure in the book lies in just finding out the incredibly varied species which have  returned to the Big Apple, and from the substantial proof this offers of Nature's fundamental  resiliency.  Less satisfactory is her analysis of why this resurgence of the wild world is occurring and  her failure to recognize how easily it could be reversed.  For the most part, Matthews falls back on such  environmentalist stand-bys as limitations on pesticide use, disruption of natural habitat and the like.  But the most likely cause goes unmentioned : Man has basically stopped killing these creatures, and so  they are ever more prevalent and brazen.  The DDT ban has of course had an impact, just not the one  she's talking about.  With the publication of Rachel Carson's scare-mongering bestseller, Silent Spring  (see Orrin's review), government reacted by both limiting the use of chemicals to kill pests and by  protecting &quot;endangered&quot; species.  It can therefore come as no surprise that there are more bugs, many  laden with disease, and more animals, than there were forty years ago.  Even if we don't dismiss the  possibility that there were beneficial effects from the pesticide limitations, ask yourself a simple  question : if you let people hunt and trap peregrine falcons and coyotes again, how many would there  be in New York City at the end of the month ?<br />Though she never approaches this topic directly, Matthews periodically touches on it when she's tossing  statistics around.  For instance, the U.S. deer population is now over 20 million, higher than it was  when Europeans got here.  Or again, when Massachusetts banned the trapping of beavers, their numbers  skyrocketed from 18,000 to 55,000.  Gee, no kidding ?  It can hardly be coincidental that the explosive  growth of these populations has paralleled the restriction of hunting and trapping.<br />For the most part, the return of American wildlife has been handled up until now as a feel good story  in the national media.  After all, it's pretty hard at first glance to feel anything but satisfaction at having  &quot;saved&quot; Bambi, and it was easy for the, as Ms Matthews notes, predominantly urban citizenry to ignore  the consequences when they were mostly being felt in rural areas.  But now it's not just the yokels who  are being killed in collisions with deer, elk and moose, nor just farmers who have to worry about the  predations of wolves, bear, and coyotes.  Now all of these critters are tying up city traffic, colliding  with yuppies cars, damming up urban waterways, killing pigeons in front of office workers and  housewives, and suddenly, we've got a &quot;crisis.&quot;  It used to be said that a conservative was a liberal  who'd been mugged.  Today, a hunting advocate is an environmentalist who's had his car destroyed and  his life nearly lost, when two hundred pounds of deer or a couple tons of moose came rocketing up his  hood and through the windshield.  That makes the problem personal in a hurry.<br />Since Man crawled from the muck, he has had but one goal, to vanquish and control Nature.  But in  recent years, sentiment and political correctness have made Man a neutral in this battle, if not an actual  collaborator with the enemy.  Anne Matthews amply demonstrates the degree to which Nature has taken  advantage of this one-sided truce.  What's lacking here though is a realization that this state of affairs is  unlikely to continue.  Every Biff and Muffy in Westchester County may support the idea of  reintroducing wolves out West, but when those deer in their backyards are carrying ticks with Lyme  Disease and when those wolves start bringing down the family dogs, it seems extraordinarily unlikely  that the Natural world will be able to maintain its current sacrosanct status.  And when the local beaver  turn the neighborhood into a government protected wetland, driving property values into the dumpster,  government officials won't be able to repeal such regulations fast enough.<br />Projecting endlessly burgeoning animal populations adds drama to the story she has to tell, but  Matthews decision to do so seems rather shortsighted.  Similarly, in her final chapter,  she takes the  most extreme global warming predictions and forecasts a future for New York, and the planet, that is  so dire that it's just not believable, with continually rising temperatures and ocean levels and declining  air quality standards.  This overreach is too bad, because up until then she does a nice job of balancing  the amusement provided by and the dread inspired by the renewed confrontation of Man and Nature.  But, in these closing pages she goes way over the top, on the basis of fairly sketchy evidence.<br />On balance, it's a very entertaining book.  Matthews at least raises a number of issues which are  destined to consume public attention in the coming years and does so with an observant eye and great  good humor.<br />GRADE : Baken  advantage of this one-sided truce.

B. Mark Smith traces the efforts over that period by market officials and  government regulators to restrict and punish the shenanigans that dishonest traders and companies can  dream up and of analysts to try and figure out precisely what drives market valuation.  Steering a  middle ground between the pessimism of Robert Schiller's Irrational Exuberance and the optimism of  James K. Glassman's Dow 36,000, Smith seems to play the facts pretty straight and to cautiously  advocate the view that the market, and specifically the value placed on stocks, has become increasingly  rational over time.  The importance of his thesis, however gingerly proposed, becomes obvious when  he makes the point that the Market has gone from being perceived as a somewhat crooked den of  speculation to the single most important investment venue for the great mass of Americans.<br />This radical change has been so gradual that it is easy to ignore, but Smith's book makes it clear just  how humongous a factor it is in modern life.  Consider for a moment the very real prospect that Social  Security will, over the next generation, become a largely private, stock based retirement system.  At  the time that Social Security was created, this idea would have been dismissed as a form of dementia.<br />The one weakness of the book, and it is a weakness of market forecasters in general, is that it largely  ignores such political realities in analyzing stock values.  For the truth of the matter is that even if  stocks are overvalued right now, three major factors are about to be brought to bear on the market :<br />  (1)  Tax Cuts :  Already well off, the American people will, over the next few years, be getting  ever larger shares of their tax dollars back and that money is going to end up somewhere.  Considering our already elevated standard of living, retirement accounts seem a likely destination.<br />  (2)  Permanently Balanced Budgets : Though it has virtually escaped the notice of most people,  we face a situation where Federal bonds may cease to exist and where there is no competition from  government for loan money.  This will both put tremendous downward pressure on interest rates  and remove bonds as an investment vehicle.  Both will drive investors toward stocks.<br />  (3)  Privatization of Retirement : This process, already well under way, will see increasing  reliance on 401k and similar types of retirement accounts, and the eventual transfer of Social  Security accounts to private control.  Here too, investors are likely to seek the type of returns that  only stocks can offer.<br />Add to these  : the growth of Free Trade; the rapidly accelerating movement of most nations toward  free market capitalism; and the huge productivity still to be realized as the entire planet becomes  computerized; and you have a recipe for a long term global economic boom and a favorable climate  for stock investment as far as the eye can see.  Smith avoids such speculation, which allows him to be  impartial in critiquing both Schiller and Glassman, but it is important to remember that the midpoint  between two extremes is not necessarily correct simply because it is moderate.  Often the truth will lie  much closer to one extreme than the other.  In this case, it seem likely that we'll see Dow 36,000 much  sooner than we'll see a 1930s style collapse.  But even if..., it is also important to recall that if you  bought stocks in the 1930s and held onto them, you would have become a very rich man.  In fact, in  one of the most startling statistics in the book, Smith points out that if you bought the S&amp;P 500 at the  top of the market in 1987, despite the precipitous October plunge, you still would have realized a 13%  return over the next ten years.  Of such stuff is rational exuberance made.<br />At any rate, this is a first rate examination of the growth of, and changes in, the stock market over its  two hundred-plus years, particularly valuable for non-experts, like me, who are headed into a future  where more and more of our wealth will be invested there.  And if Smith is a tad cautious, perhaps  that caution is appropriate to a history book.<br />GRADE : A>At any rate, this is a first rate examination of the growth of, and changes in, the stock market over its  two hundred-plus years, particularly valuable for non-experts, like me, who are headed into a future  where more and more of our wealth will be invested there.

First he wrote  this memoir, loaded with irony to appeal to Gen-Xers, continually self-referential to appeal to  postmodernists, and centered around his efforts to raise his little brother after their parents both died  of cancer, a sure chick magnet.  Then, having exposed most of his and his family members' lives to  public view (at least in theory) he adopted a Pynchonesque/Sallingeresque reclusive pose, and feigned  personal agony at having to discuss the book.  All this while cashing in big time on the supposedly  &quot;tragic&quot; events of his life.  For these savvy ploys alone he deserves to be called a &quot;staggering genius.&quot;<br />The book itself uses a host of postmodernist, ironical, satirical, etc., etc., etc...techniques, which are  rather hackneyed and, given the ostensible topic of the book (his family tragedy), quite off-putting.  A  fairly representative passage comes when he's heaving his mother's ashes (or cremains) into Lake  Michigan :<br />  Oh this is so plain, disgraceful, pathetic--<br />  Or beautiful and loving and glorious!  Yes, beautiful and loving and glorious!<br />  But even if so, even if this is right and beautiful, and she is tearing up while watching, so  proud--like what she said to me when I carried her, when she had the nosebleed and I carried her  and she said that she was proud of me, that she did not think I could do it, that I would be able to  lift her, carry her to the car, and from the car into the hospital, those words run through my head  every day, have run through every day since, she did not think I could do it but of course I did it.  I  knew I would do it, and I know this, I know what I am doing now, that I am doing something both  beautiful but gruesome because I am destroying its beauty by knowing that it might be beautiful,  know that if I know I am doing something beautiful, that it's no longer beautiful.  I fear that even  if it is beautiful in the abstract, that my doing it knowing that it's beautiful and worse, knowing that  I will very soon be documenting it, that in my pocket is a tape recorder brought for just that  purpose--that all this makes this act of potential beauty somehow gruesome.  I am a monster.  My  poor mother.  She would do this without the thinking, without the thinking about thinking--<br />Yeah sure, I get it, the way he's having this discussion shows that he understands what's going on,  yadda, yadda, yadda...  But unfortunately, the point he's making is more accurate than his style is  clever.  There simply is something gruesome about this kind of mannered irony and the way,  throughout his life, that he seems to interpret his experiences through the filter of the book he plans to  write.<br />At the point where every thought, emotion, and action in your life must be considered for how it will  appear in print, you've become a fictional character rather than a real human being.  And by creating  so much distance between the character of Dave Eggers and the supposedly tragic events of his life,  Eggers (the author) makes it really hard for the reader to care much.  I finished the book unstaggered  and heart unbroken, but grudgingly forced to admit that the literary world has a potential new genius,  a writer with a genius for self promotion the likes of which we've not seen since Norman Mailer; and  we all know how the Norman Mailer story has gone : badly.<br />GRADE : C-nger beautiful.

He's absolutely hilarious there : his sarcastic style is ideally suited to the format and he's got  Imus continually directing him to new topics at which to spew venom.  But after reading several of his  books--all of which I've liked, but not loved--I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't need a better  editor to bring some form to his very funny observations.<br />Queenan's latest book, Balsamic Dreams, is intended to be an indictment of the Baby Boomer  Generation, of which he is an embarrassed member.  He's operating in what Norman Schwarzkopf  might call a target rich environment here, and almost inevitably much of what he has to say is very  amusing, even laugh-out-loud funny in places.  But somehow, it's not as good a book as it should be.<br />There are a couple of problems.  For one thing, he's really written a series of interconnected essays  rather than one sustained indictment.  This makes for some rather distracting disorganization and some  truly annoying repetition.  Worse, he periodically himself gets distracted from the task at hand.  I  thoroughly enjoyed his attacks on the so-called Greatest Generation and on Gen-X, but in these  sections of the book he's essentially defending the Boomers, rather than garroting them, which is what  we'd prefer.<br />The other problem isn't so much structural, it's ideological.  Queenan's thesis is that the Boomers  started out well, but then sold out.  He repeatedly gives them credit for \\"the Freedom Riders.  Woodstock, Four Dead in Ohio, driving Nixon from office, Jon Voight in Midnight Cowboy\\", but  then says that after that they became selfish, self-absorbed, and obsessed with their material well  being.  Which is all well and good, except that : Midnight Cowboy sucked; as he himself says, the  Boomers as they exist in our minds are the sons and daughters of the Post-WWII white middle class,  and as such weren't a significant part of the Civil Rights movement; Woodstock was the epitome of the  generation's irresponsible self-indulgence which was then conflated into some kind of meaningful  statement of peace, love, and brotherhood; and both driving Nixon from office and getting gunned  down at Kent State were fundamentally related to their desire to avoid service in Vietnam, which,  though Queenan largely avoids the topic, is the primary crime they have to answer for.  Basically, he's  completely wrong about whether his generation was ever worthwhile, and this too seems a function of  his natural inclination to defend his own : the Boomers didn't decline over time, they began badly.<br />Oddly enough, the best moments in the book come when Queenan is making serious points, rather  than comic ones.  At one point, when discussing the total farce that Boomers have turned funerals into,  with songs, multiple insipid eulogies, and readings from inane fare like the Tibetan Book of the Dead,  he says that :<br />    Because we Baby Boomers believe in nothing, we end up acting like we believe in everything.<br />Elsewhere, while visiting a dying friend, Queenan is approached by a woman he doesn't know who  clearly wants to hug him, but avoids her :<br />    After an awkward silence, she spoke : 'It's a shame that men have so much trouble showing their     emotions,' she whispered.  It was classic Baby Boomer feminism.  What she meant was : 'You     probably have the same feelings that I do, but you can't possibly show them, because that would     necessitate revealing your feminine side, which this hideously repressive society prohibits you from     doing.'  It was also classic Baby Boomer behavior in that it capitalized on an inappropriate,     emotionally devastating moment to launch a skirmish in the ongoing gender wars.<br />    'Actually, I have no trouble showing myemotions,' I told her.  'These are my emotions.  I'm sad     that my friend is dying, and that's why I look so sad.  If my friend wasn't dying, I would probably     be smiling and look a lot happier.  I think a lot of men work this way.'<br />    'Have a nice life,' she replied.<br />    Ditto.<br />Even here though, when he's truly nailed what's most wrong with the Baby Boomers, he fails to  develop these observations into a unified and coherent brief against them, because his objections seem  to be mostly stylistic, rather than moral.  He seems more concerned with how cheesy the funerals are  and how silly the hugging is, than with the underlying causes of these behaviors.  But the Baby  Boomers aren't evil because they are gauche or tacky or melodramatic; they're evil because they don't  believe in anything but themselves and as Queenan says when discussing Bill Clinton's capacity to  show empathy without ever actually sharing a feeling, \\"...they don't actually care what other people do  as long as they say the right things....\\"   <br />There is an essential hollowness at the core of this generation.  The fact that they have no beliefs, the  way they display emotion without feeling it, the way they tried to turn simple draft avoidance into a  great crusade, the way they have warped social standards to indulge their behaviors, ...all of these  these things should be piled one on top of another by the prosecution as it makes its case that they are  the most destructive generation in history.  But Queenan, notorious for his scorched earth style and  willingness to take no prisoners, backs off, and the book suffers because of it.  <br />It's too bad, because there's much here that's funny and wickedly observant, and with a stronger editor  to keep him on track, the book might have been great.  As is, it's fun, but somewhat disappointing.  <br />GRADE : B-	2001-05-14

Margaret Visser's Geometry of Love is a  fairly representative example of this genre, better than some, no worse than most.  In it she  concentrates her attention upon the Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura Church near Rome.  By the time you  finish the book you know everything you could possibly want to know about this church, which most  of us have never heard of and will never see, except for one thing : why are churches in  general, or this one in particular, unique ?<br />Much of the book is interesting, some sections are even fascinating, but, perhaps because of the nature  of the task she's set herself, describing the church as a physical structure, it never comes alive as a  house of God.  Admittedly, as a Baptist, I've always considered church buildings themselves to be  secondary to the function they serve, as a gathering place for like-minded worshippers.  But I found  the book to be something like the parable of the three blind men describing an elephant, and Visser to  have failed to make the church anything more than the sum of its parts.  In his marvelous study, Mont  Saint Michel and Chartres,  Henry Adams observed two of the great churches of Christendom and  perceived not merely their unity, but the unity of the culture that produced them.  Margaret Visser  looks at Saint Agnes and sees the particular features of the building.  The difference in perception  seems significant.<br />GRADE : C	2001-05-13

It  is conservative to cut taxes and compassionate to give people more money to spend. It is  conservative to insist upon local control of schools and high standards and results; it is  compassionate to make sure every child learns to read and no one is left behind. It is conservative to  reform the welfare system by insisting on work; it's compassionate to free people from dependency  on government. It is conservative to reform the juvenile justice code to insist on consequences for  bad behavior; it is compassionate to recognize that discipline and love go hand in hand.  -George W. Bush<br />We conservatives are admittedly cranky; after all, we spend most of our days worrying that the rest of  you slovenly lot are driving the country, if not the World, towards Hell just as fast as you can go.  But  even for folks as dour as us, the reaction to George W. Bush's use of the label &quot;compassionate  conservative&quot; was fairly crusty.  For many on the Right, it was a particularly objectionable  formulation because of its implicit suggestion that normal, garden variety, conservatism lacks  compassion.  Meanwhile, Democrats, the Press, and the rest of the Left reacted angrily because they  think the two terms are mutually exclusive.  It's an article of their faith that compassion can only be  demonstrated by slathering money on a problem and by absolving the downtrodden of any blame for  their predicament.  Conservatism, with its emphasis on limited government and personal  responsibility, just doesn't fit their view of compassion.<br />So it's helpful to refer to the man who more than anyone else was responsible for generating the focus  on compassion as a conservative issue, Marvin Olasky.  A professor at the University of Texas, a  senior fellow at The Progress and Freedom Foundation, the editor of World Magazine, and an  informal advisor to the Bush campaign, Olasky has a very specific definition in mind when he speaks  of compassion, one that is very different from how modern liberalism defines it, but which also  contains an important challenge to conservatives.<br />The Democrats' definition of choice for the term would be something along the lines of the first entry  at Dictionary.com :<br />  com·pas·sion (km-pshn)  n.  Deep awareness of the suffering of another coupled with the wish to relieve it.<br />This is the sort of wholly impersonal, but theoretically well-intentioned, caring and empathy that Bill  Clinton was so good at faking.  Under this definition, proper emotional response and a willingness to  spend money are sufficient to demonstrate compassion.<br />Olasky is asking for a return to an older definition, one that demands more :<br />  compassion \Com*pas&quot;sion\, n. [F., fr. L. compassio, fr. compati to have compassion; com-  + pati to bear, suffer. See Patient.] Literally, suffering with another; a sensation of sorrow  excited by the distress or misfortunes of another; pity; commiseration.<br />It is the notion of suffering with someone that he's after here.  In this sense, government action is bad  not just because it turns those it is intended to help into dependents, but also because it creates a  distance between the intended beneficiaries and the rest of us, who should actually be required to  participate in their suffering.  It is this element of compassionate conservatism which necessarily leads  to Faith Based Initiatives.  The kind of participatory compassion he's referring to, requires the kind of  volunteer social services which are really only delivered effectively by our churches, temples and  mosques.<br />In turn, the reliance on our great moral institutions leads into the other retrograde element of the  definition that Olasky wants to bring back, this is the idea that the need for the compassion of others  imposes an obligation on the recipient.  It is not enough to accept largesse from taxpayers, you have to  work for and warrant the charity you receive.<br />Throughout the book, Olasky cites example after example of organizations and congregations which  are providing this sort of charity.  He demonstrates that their success depends both on the involvement  of caring private individuals to provide the services and the commitment to traditional values like  morality, self sufficiency and self respect on the part of those they serve.  These examples present a  challenge to both the Left and the Right, requiring that the Left accept the idea that recipients of social  assistance will meet certain moral standards and requiring of both the Left and the Right a  commitment to fund and staff private and religious charities.  It is difficult to judge how successfully  these challenges might be met, because right now the government takes such a huge portion of our  wealth, provides these programs (however inadequately), and places practically no burdens on  recipients.  With the Social Welfare State having proved an ignominious failure, Welfare Reform in  place, and the Faith Based Initiative approaching reality, we're well on the way to testing Olasky's  ideas.  For the sake of our own souls, the poor's livelihoods, and the civic health, let's hope we're all  up to the challenge.<br />GRADE : B-bring back, this is the idea that the need for the compassion of others  imposes an obligation on the recipient.

It will, inevitably, grow  with the years.  Like all legends, it is composed of falsehood and fact.  In this case, the truth is  more compelling than the trappings of imagination with which it has been invested.  The man who  has become a legendary figure was, perhaps, of greater stature in simple reality than he will ever be  in the oft-repeated, and expanded, tales which commemorate his deeds.  Here, before the whole  matter gets out of hand, is how it was...<br />  His name was Homer Smith.  -The Lilies of the Field<br />  And why do you worry about clothing?  Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they  neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.  But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the  oven, will he not much more clothe you- you of little faith?  Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What  will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we  wear?'  For it is the gentiles who strive for  all these things. But strive first for the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and  all these things  will be given to you as well.  'So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow  will bring worries  of its own.  Today's trouble is enough for today.  -Matthew 6:28-34<br />It's maddening to see so many references to The Lilies of the Field, both book and movie, as &quot;minor.&quot;  Sure, it's a short book.  Yes, the characters and situation are so idealized that it's nearly a fable.  No, it  does not accurately reflect the state of race relations in America in the early 1960s, nor at any other  time anywhere, for that matter.  But ask yourself this : how many books have you read in your life  that actually made you feel more optimistic about the prospects of the species ?  If it's really that easy  to create sympathetic characters and write a story that uplifts the spirits, why haven't more authors  written them ?  Isn't it fair to conclude that the paucity of such stories, and the memorable nature of  this one, indicate just how major an occurrence it is when one gets written ?<br />At any rate, hopefully everyone knows the tale, either from the great film or from a required reading  in High School.  As the opening lines above indicate, Homer Smith is a nearly mythological figure, a  kind of John Henry, Paul Bunyan, or Shane.  In an unlikely turn of events, this black Baptist former  Army sergeant ends up helping some Catholic nuns, refugees from East Germany, to build a chapel in  the New Mexico desert, despite a lack of help, tools, and materials.<br />Homer Smith brings an invaluable set of qualities to his task, chief among them : self confidence, self  reliance, a puritan work ethic, and a healthy amount of pride.  Mother Maria Marthe, the Teutonic  leader of the tiny band of nuns, brings one great gift, faith :<br />  Faith.  It is a word for what is unreasonable.  If a man believes in an unreasonable thing, that is  faith.<br />Mother genuinely believes that God will provide, even that Homer has been sent by God, and that He  will see to it that the chapel is built.  The powerful combination of this mismatched pair's inner  strengths serves as an inspiration to the entire community. Hispanic, Anglo, and Black; Catholic and  Protestant; wealthy and poor; German, Mexican, and American; they come together to create a unique  house of worship.  And as the legend of Homer Smith grows in the desert, Mother Maria Marthe says  of him :<br />  'That is the chapel of Saint Benedict the Moor.  ... That painting of the saint is the work of Sister  Albertine.  The model was a man named Schmidt who came to us under the direction of God.  He  built this chapel with his two hands under great difficulties.  It is all from him.'<br />  She pauses then and her voice drops.  'He was not of our faith, nor of our skin,' she says, 'but he  was a man of greatness, of an utter devotion.'<br />Just as Homer's devotion to his task and Mother's faith give them a certain greatness, the aspirational  beauty of this book gives it too a greatness that defies that parsimonious &quot;minor&quot; classification.<br />GRADE : A+s not of our faith, nor of our skin,' she says, 'but he     was a man of greatness, of an utter devotion.'<br />Just as Homer's devotion to his task and Mother's faith give them a certain greatness, the aspirational  beauty of this book gives it too a greatness that defies that parsimonious &quot;minor&quot; classification.<br />GRADE : A+	2001-05-11
2005939:US	52173832	R7MYCP3JS844C	0374176744	930001307	The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation, Bilingual Edition (Italian Edition)	Books	5	8	20	N	N	let 'em rot	There is a certain, rather delicate, aspect of the modern liberal sensibility that rebels against Dante's  Inferno.  In his account of returning to Columbia to restudy Western Civilization, David Denby is  surprised not to like Dante much :<br />  I could not rid myself of the notion that Dante had entered into complicity with torture. In some  way, he believed in torture; he justified it. . . . My reading of Dante was a failure, and of the most  direct sort: I didn't enjoy it<br />And in his introduction to this translation by Robert Pinsky, John Freccero says that :<br />  In spite of Dante's reputation as the greatest of Christian poets, there is no sign of Christian  forgiveness in the Inferno.  The dominant theme is not mercy but justice, dispensed with the  severity of the ancient law of retribution.<br />  ...<br />  Justice in Hell is meant to be objective, measured out by a bureaucratic monster in proportion to the  specific gravity of the sin.  Such a mechanical administration of punishment leaves no room for  judicial error or caprice.<br />  Few of Dante's readers have derived much satisfaction from the triumph of this somewhat  anonymous justice.<br />These sentiments, with which I could not disagree more strongly, reflect the curious point we've  reached in Western history.  On the one hand, the intelligentsia find torture, capital punishment,  virtually any civil rights imposition, to be unacceptable when it comes to actual evil doers, but blithely  advocates abortion, euthanasia, and the like, for genuine innocents.  Human beings in this world view  are judged by their physical condition, rather than by their moral standing.  And yet, it is Dante who is  adjudged to be brutal.<br />Personally, I find something comforting in the idea that, in a world where so much evil exists, those  who are evil might face eternal perdition.  Particularly satisfying is the presence of the great romantic  lovers in Hell--Tristan and Iseult, Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, etc..  I've always found disturbing the  literature  which celebrates love which must perforce be so shallow as these great affairs--it's nice to  think of them getting their comeuppance.<br />As a rule though, it seems likely that readers' reactions to the rather severe treatment of the souls in  Hell will track their own political leanings.  If you are someone who wishes that justice were  objective, you're unlikely to be offended.  If you tend to wring your hands in agony at the prospect of  someone being held accountable for their actions, you won't feel comfortable with the fate Dante  forecasts.  In either case, the poem itself is truly great and in Robert Pinsky's translation, it's  reasonably easy to follow.  You will want to refer to the notes frequently and a study guide of some  kind can't hurt.  I also recommend the recorded version : hearing it read aloud adds to the experience  greatly.<br />GRADE : A+lt, Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, etc..

She brought up her children very much as she herself had been brought up, and she hoped that  when they were spoken of it would be in connection with their nice manners, their pleasant  dispositions, and their cleanliness, for these were qualities she valued above all others.  -Mrs. Bridge<br />...<br />Toward the end of the book, their son Douglas heads off to WWII.  But where  the senior Bridges are tradition bound and deeply conformist, their children and their society are  changing rapidly.  In 117 vignettes, Evan Connell paints a sympathetic but fairly condescending  portrait of Mrs. Bridge as she fights to hold back the tide of these changes.  She struggles to preserve  proprieties and appearances as her three children grow increasingly rebellious at the stifling social  conventions that she seeks to force upon them.<br />Meanwhile, as the children grow away from her, and with Mr. Bridge completely focused on his legal  work, Mrs. Bridge begins to sense an emptiness in her own life.  At one point, a friend who later takes  her own life asks : &quot;Have you ever felt like those people in the Grimm fairy tales--the ones who were  all hollowed out in back?&quot;  This is pretty clearly Connell's point in the book, that Mrs. Bridge,  however likable, is indeed hollow, that she is all deference to her husband, service to her children, and  conformity to public mores, with no room left over for a unique and genuine person.  He conveys this  message with great humor and no little understanding, but it can't help but be a pretty harsh indictment  of her essentially wasted life.<br />This is, of course, a rather conventional view of Middle America, particularly the Middle America of  the 1910s and 1920s...Unfortunately for the  literary class, their dismissive judgment of the...Bridges has proven quite wrong-headed.  In retrospect it has become obvious that removing the religious, social, and moral constraints which  the Bridge children (and Connell and Lewis and so on) found so laughable has not led to greater  happiness and personal fulfillment but instead has produced a society consumed by its own  pathologies...<br />Interestingly enough, Evan Connell, Mrs. Bridge and the Bridge children all seem to intuitively grasp  the fact that the world of the Bridges is too valuable to toss away.  Connell's portrayal of Mrs. Bridge  is entirely too sympathetic for us to seriously believe that he thinks she's wasted her life.  Moreover,  the three best scenes in the novel all deal favorably with the life she has chosen.  There's a moment  where she considers voting for the radical Left in an election, but instead :<br />  ...when the moment finally came she pulled the lever recording her wish for the world to remain as  it was.<br />Then there are two scenes with Mr. Bridge, the famous one where, having gone to their club to  celebrate their anniversary, he refuses to leave the dinner table as a tornado approaches.  The twister  does indeed miss them, but the episode suggests the solidity of Mr. Bridge and of their marriage, both  unyielding even to forces of nature :<br />  The tornado, whether impressed by his intransigence or touched by her devotion, had drawn itself  up into the sky and was never seen or heard of again.<br />And in the most moving scene, Mrs. Bridge, despite having not cooked in years, tries to make Mr.  Bridge's favorite dessert, pineapple bread, and biffs it horribly, Mr. Bridge gently tells her, &quot;Never  mind&quot;, and the next day brings her a dozen roses.  Though Mr. Bridge is rarely even present in the  book, these episodes capture the strength and essential goodness of the marriage.<br />Finally, though the children move away, even move quite far away, the most pleasant thoughts of the  more rebellious daughter are of home and the other daughter returns whenever there's trouble in her  own ill-advised marriage.  And the son, Douglas, grows up to be a man very much like his father.  They, like Mrs. Bridge, and like the author himself, seem to realize that though the life that the  Bridges have made may at first seem emotionally stunted, overly circumscribed, and unfulfilling, upon  further reflection, there is something powerfully compelling about it.  Will the children of the Bridges'  children feel that same internal tug toward home ?  And will their children ?  One doubts it.<br />This book is terrific, by turns moving and funny and heartbreaking.  But in the end, the Bridges come  off much better than Connell intended, and forty years later they look better still.  Would that we had  a bridge back to the simple values they represent.<br />GRADE : A-.

'I hear it on many lips, but pressure of  business prevents my attention.'  Rising, he went to pick it up, carefully consulting their  expressions; they seemed to acknowledge this gesture of socialty, and so he proceeded.  'A mystery?  Excuse my abysmal ignorance.'  He turned the pages.<br />  'Not a mystery,' Paul said.  'On the contrary, interesting form of fiction possibly within genre of  science fiction.'<br />  'Oh no,' Betty disagreed.  'No science in it.  Nor set in future.  Scienmce fiction deals with future,  in particular future where science has advanced over now.  Book fits neither premise.'  -The Man in the High Castle<br />The central concern of all of Phillip K. Dick's speculative fiction seems to be our perception of reality  and whether we can trust it, probably not surprising obsessions for an author who reportedly had his  own problems coping with reality.  So it's natural for him to have been one of the earlier writers to try  out the alternate history genre. In this novel, Japan and Germany, having won WWII, have divvied up  the globe.  It's 1962 there too, but the Japanese administer California, while the Eastern United States  is subservient to Germany.<br />The story, such as it is, follows a variety of characters, American, German and Japanese, at a time  when Germany has been plunged into crisis by the death of the fuhrer, Martin Bormann.  Along with  this backdrop of the succession struggle, and rumors of Germany's intent to nuke her long time ally  Japan,  the American population has become captivated by a novel called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy  by Hawthorne Abendsen, a reclusive author who lives in a secluded castle.  The novel speculates about  an alternate history where America wins WWII.  The Germans have tried suppressing the book, but  now Japanese too have begun reading it and one of the women in the book determines to try and track  Abendsen down.  As an additional subplot, the I Ching has become a dominant force in people's lives,  with Americans following the Japanese lead in allowing it to chart their future actions.  It is speculated  that Abendsen may actually have written his novel according to the directions of the I Ching.<br />That's all there really is to the story.  The plot is pretty much nonexistent, action minimal, and the  book ends almost at random.  As far as one can tell, the whole thing is just an elaborate joke, with the  book being a kind of doppelganger for reality.  Puzzled readers and Dick fanatics have conjectured  that the author himself may have let the I Ching make plot decisions and simply stopped writing when  it told him to stop.  Whatever the case, it's easier to enjoy the ironies in retrospect than it is to enjoy  the essentially directionless novel while you're reading it.<br />GRADE : Cdown.

When satire is aimed at powerless people, it is not only cruel but profoundly vulgar.  -Molly Ivins, NY Times Book Review on Imperial Caddy by Joe Queenan<br />It's hard to imagine how Molly Ivins could be more wrong, though not the least bit surprising that she  is.  The natural target of satire is not power, but stupidity, and it is simply one of those brutal facts of  life that the powerless are often so because they are stupid, while the powerful, though quite often  stupid themselves, are usually less so.  Satire is however an important weapon to use against the  powerful, because their stupidity has a tendency to affect us all, whereas the stupidity of the powerless  is generally fairly harmless.  She is right though, that the satirist will often appear to be cruel and  vulgar; after all, their profession basically consists of pointing out how stupid people are.  But it is  possible, perhaps even necessary, for them to leaven this effect by pointing out one other thing : their  own stupidity.  No humorist is more savage than Joe Queenan, but in recent years he's learned this  lesson and taken to making himself the butt of his own humor.<br />When his job as a self described &quot;hatchet man critic&quot; found him watching the Robert Rodriguez film,  El Mariachi, which was notoriously said to have been made for $7000, Joe Queenan decided that he  was so sick of hearing these kinds of obviously confabulated stories about independent filmmakers that  he would try it himself :<br />  [A]ll Rodriguez had proven was that someone could make a movie for $7,000. What would be  really cool was proving that anyone could make a movie for $7,000. And that anyone was going to  be me.<br />This book details his misadventures as he sets out to do just that--well, actually to make one for  $6,998.<br />He quickly determined that in order to keep costs down, and headaches to a minimum, his movie,  Twelve Steps to Death, would have to be made without professional help, or rather interference,  because professionals wouldn't be willing to make the necessary compromises.  So instead, he wrote,  directed and acted in it himself; used friends, family and neighbors; and shot the whole thing in his  hometown of Tarrytown, NY..  Much of the book is taken up by the script and by the very funny  process of making the movie, which ends up costing twice the budgeted price even with all the corner  cutting.<br />Then an interesting thing happens, Queenan finds himself getting caught up in the whole deal and  starts to think in bigger terms than just showing it can't be done.  He starts to think about having a  finished product that people will actually pay for.  The cynic starts to care.  And so he begins blowing  larger and larger sums of money to get the picture edited, add sound effects and music, and produce a  quality print.  He stages and of course wins his own film festival, where Twelve Steps is the only  entry and the judges are friends, in-laws, and his mother.  Then he takes the movie to a Dallas Film  Festival...and the roof falls in on his dreams.  In its review of the movie, the Dallas Observer  compared it to &quot;a flatulent snuffalupagus, pausing before each target and expelling noxious gases.&quot;<br />This is all very funny, but along the way something more profound is also revealed.  Queenan  discovers that it just isn't that easy, despite all his sniping over the years, to make a good movie.  More  important, he offers the reader a chance to see just how divorced from that reality he became.  Queenan actually deceived himself into thinking that the movie was good, when it was manifestly, and  virtually had to be, awful.  And he's one of the most cynical guys on the planet; imagine how much  easier it must be for artists, with their inherently dreamy temperaments, to trick themselves.  No  wonder most art isn't very good.  The people who produce it are fundamentally incapable of  maintaining the emotional distance that is required to judge it objectively.  In the end the joke is on  Joe Queenan as he learns this valuable lesson--that people don't set out to make crappy movies, they  just turn out that way, despite their best intentions--in devastating, but very amusing, fashion.<br />GRADE : Bn't very good.

This was toward the end of the nineteenth  century, when on any streetcorner in America you might see some ordinary-looking citizen who  was destined to invent a new kind of bottlecap or tin can, start a chain of five-cent stores, sell a  faster and better elevator, or open a fabulous new department store with big display windows made  possible by an improved process for manufacturing sheets of glass.  Although Martin Dressler was a  shopkeeper's son, he too dreamed his dream, and at last he was lucky enough to do what few people  even dare to imagine: he satisfied his heart's desire. But this is a perilous privilege, which the gods  watch jealously, waiting for the flaw, the little flaw, that brings everything to ruin, in the end.  -Martin Dressler<br />Steve Millhauser, in both the subtitle of this book and the opening lines quoted above, notifies the  reader that the story of Martin Dressler is the stuff of myth, and an intensely American myth at that.  In the New York City of the 1890s, Martin rises from humble beginnings in his father's cigar store to  become the City's greatest hotelier.  With each new wildly successful venture, Martin's dreams grow in  scope.  Until he arrives at his final creation, the Grand Cosmo, with subterranean levels and hidden  rooms.  It houses impossibilities like trout streams and geysers, boardwalks and bazaars :<br />  [T]he Grand Cosmo was not a tourist attraction or a hotel for transients, but a world within the  world, rivaling the world; and whoever entered its walls had no further need of that other world.<br />But when it starts to fail, Martin wonders if he is at last a victim of hubris :<br />  For surely the Grand Cosmo was an act of disobedience.  Or he was being punished for something  deeper than crime, for a desire, a forbidden desire, the desire to create the world ?<br />Indeed, this time Martin has gone too far and not all the genius of his creation, nor the power of his  advertisements and promotions can save the Grand Cosmo from failure.  But as the story ends and he  looks back on his life he is relatively content :<br />  For he had done as he liked, he had gone his own way, built his castle in the air.  And if in the end  he had dreamed the wrong dream, the dream that others didn't wish to enter, then that was the way  of dreams, it was only to be expected, he had no desire to have dreamt otherwise.<br />Besides the magic tinged prose, something like a cross between E. L Doctorow and Mark Helprin,  what gives the book its great power is this essential vision.  Of course Martin has dared too much and  has left his patrons behind, but there's a strong sense throughout, even as he's failing, that such  extravagant dreamers are central to American innovation, even central to human progress.  For what  may have started out as a comment on the all-consuming nature of capitalism and of the American  Dream, ends up partaking of the Fall of Man and dealing with the mad ambitions that drive the  species.  Martin's dreams may ultimately come a cropper, but how much worse never to have dreamed  ?  This is an ambitious attempt at epic mythmaking which succeeds brilliantly.<br />GRADE : A+desire to create the world ?<br />Indeed, this time Martin has gone too far and not all the genius of his creation, nor the power of his  advertisements and promotions can save the Grand Cosmo from failure.

2012020:US	52173832	R36VL28O8VD5P3	080506740X	332004355	How Race Is Lived in America: Pulling Together, Pulling Apart	Books	2	24	45	N	N	even the self-congratulatory intro makes your flesh crawl	We now live in such a media conscious world that no one was fold for a single minute when the New  York Times began its series on Race.  No one believed they had any intention to honestly explore and  take a fresh look at the issues surrounding race relations in America.  No one expected them to get  beyond the hoariest platitudes and exhausted clich&eacute;s.  There was never even the remotest chance that  they would challenge their own, and their readers, elite assumptions.  The fundamental unseriousness  of the project was reflected in the parodies that even the Times's fellow liberal organs, like The New  Republic, felt compelled to publish and by a comment from Mickey Kaus, of Slate magazine, whose  Kaus Files provide the Series Skipper, condensations of interminably boring newspaper serials like this  one so that folks can discuss them as if they'd read them.  Even Kaus said that he hadn't condensed  How Race is Lived because he would have had to read it first.  No, from the start it was well  understood that this much ballyhooed endeavor was simply a bid to win a Pulitzer, which it promptly  and predictably did.<br />The entire series has been collected here and there are accompanying websites which reprint most of  the material, as the Times imitates a demented Roman Emperor building monuments to himself.  Unfortunately, to have them all gathered in one place and to try to struggle through the turgid pages is  to realize just how utterly banal the whole project truly is.  Though the settings for the various pieces  range from churches to boardrooms to tv studios to army barracks to locker rooms to slaughterhouses,  the stories have a deadening sameness to them.  But even worse, where one would think that the  sameness is the story, it is instead ignored, because what it tells us is inconvenient and doesn't fit a  storyline that the Times wants to tell.<br />First of all, the only races in the series are black and white.  Asians and Hispanics only rarely make  appearances, and when they do it is often to illustrate a point about blacks.  Thus, Governor Gary  Locke of Washington shows up, but only so we can see how he was able to use his Asian background  and the accompanying positive stereotypes to his advantage in politics, while black rivals felt  compelled to play down their race, with its negative stereotypes.  Likewise, in the story on two Cuban  immigrant friends, they are not on hand to explore the plight of Hispanics in America, instead the  story focuses on how much harder it has been for the darker skinned man to assimilate than the fairer  skinned.<br />The second unifying theme is that the whites in these pieces are universally sick of the entire subject.  To a man (and woman) they just want to get beyond it.  They recognize that blacks have been  victimized by racism in the past, seem genuinely sorry about that fact, seem to be trying very hard to  improve their own attitudes and behaviors, and are now ready to let the whole matter drop.<br />The third theme is that blacks are not so willing.  To judge from the Times, black America very  carefully nurses its grievances, perceives racism and discrimination lurking behind every statement,  glance and action of white Americans, and is now just waiting around for some external force to  change this situation.  In the most chilling scenes in the series, blacks act to segregate themselves, to  push away whites who seek to join with them, and to denigrate any black who &quot;acts white&quot;--i.e.,  shows an interest in getting an education.  The most depressing story here is about three girlfriends in  the South Orange-Maplewood, NJ school system who drifted apart in High School, largely because the  black girl's black peers put pressure on her not to associate with non-blacks.  The other affecting piece  is about the young white man who was recruited to play quarterback by historically black Southern  College but left after two years of race baiting and death threats.<br />As the general themes and these specific articles show, there is an interesting and important story just  waiting to be told, but the Times ignored it and its implications.  Suppose the Times had asked and  sought to answer the question that its own reporting raises : if racial tension in America essentially  boils down to lingering black resentment, however justified, against whites, and if whites are no  longer willing to apologize and compensate for past prejudices, then where will racial progress in  America come from in the future ?  Doesn't it necessarily have to come from blacks themselves,  figuring out some way to get beyond the horrible things that were done to them in the past ?  And  while, presumably, no one would suggest that blacks abandon their own culture, doesn't the general  hostility to and rejection of white culture that the series chronicles suggest that blacks will continue to  have an extraordinarily difficult timer succeeding in what, like it or not, remains a fundamentally  white (western European, Judeo-Christian, liberal/capitalist/protestant/democratic) culture in America  ?  Set aside the issue of whether blacks are entitled, in some abstract sense of concepts of justice, to  more compensation from white America; the fact is that they aren't going to get it, so what do they do  now ?<br />But to even ask these questions would antagonize the readers and the core constituencies of the Times.  And worse, they don't give out Pulitzers to series that ask these kinds of questions.  So the reader is  faced with a massive psychic disconnect in this book as it relentlessly refuses to consider the most  obvious questions it raises.  There's a funny scene in the movie Barcelona where a lunkheaded  character asks his friend something to the effect of  :<br />  Okay, I get the idea of subtext, but what's above the subtext.<br />How Race is Lived in America has a similar problem, it is all subtext with no text.

The genius of this question is that it calls attention to--though, typical of Brian Lamb, he  doesn't dwell on it--one of the real scams of the book industry, the fact that the folks who are blurbed  frequently have some previous relationship with the author.  Someone, it may have been The New  Republic, actually used to have a terrific feature where they untangled these relationships.  My favorite  recurring motif is where the Author's Acknowledgment thanks a person who, we suddenly realize, has  not so coincidentally provided an encomium for the cover.  Harder to track down, but equally  amusing, are the mutual blurbs, where authors' words of praise appear on each other's books.<br />Now, I'd read Geoffrey Norman's Morgan Hunt series several years ago in paperback, and thoroughly  enjoyed it.  But had I not, what right-thinking man could resist the blandishments on the back of this  hardcover that I found; the authors quoted are : James Hall and Loren D. Estleman, an outstanding  thriller writer and the best private eye novelist of his generation respectively; P.J. O'Rourke, one of the  funniest political writers going; and not just one but both Buckleys, Christopher and William F., Jr..  I  mean, c'mon, even once you realize that Geoffrey Norman is a contributor to National Review  (founded by WFB) and Forbes FYI (edited by Christopher) and has written for The American  Spectator (once home to PJ), you just aren't likely to ignore that collection of famous fans.<br />As I said, the books are outstanding irrespective of who endorses them.  Morgan Hunt is a former  Green Beret and an ex-convict, having killed the man who was physically abusing his sister.  He lives  in the Florida Panhandle, and the natural world is an integral part of the stories.  He's tough but  likable, and though he's got a streak of machismo and a fearsome moral code, it's not as if Norman is  trying to brainwash unsuspecting readers with conservative dogma.<br />Blue Chipper might even surprise some folks, who tend to pigeon hole conservatives.  The story  centers around the exploitation of poor black athletes, in this case a basketball phenom, by scholastic  athletic programs and coaches.  Norman lives on the Florida Gulf Coast for part of the year, his  column for National Review is on sports, and he writes about hunting and the outdoors for Sports  Afield.  This entry in the series gives him the chance to flex all his muscles, which he does to good  effect.<br />Of course, the other half of the year he spends in the People's Republic of Vermont and you should  really be sure to track down his columns on the increasingly frightening politics of the Green  Mountain State.  They are a hoot.<br />GRADE : Augh but  likable, and though he's got a streak of machismo and a fearsome moral code, it's not as if Norman is  trying to brainwash unsuspecting readers with conservative dogma.  <br />Blue Chipper might even surprise some folks, who tend to pigeon hole conservatives.

In The Shawl (1980), Rosa Lublin is reduced to having her baby, Magda, suck on a shawl, in  order to keep her quite enough to escape the notice of concentration camp guards.  But when her niece,  Stella, takes the shawl the baby is discovered and murdered in a particularly brutal fashion.<br />Rosa (1983) takes place thirty years later in Miami.  Rosa has recently destroyed her antique/junk shop  in New York City.  Now she barely scrapes by in a dingy hotel room, funded by Stella, the two joined  to each other by secrets and guilt.  She spends much of her time writing letters to Magda, on any  pieces of paper she can scrounge.<br />Though Stella says that life is divided into three parts for survivors : &quot;The life before, the life during,  the life after&quot;, Rosa finds herself eternally stuck in &quot;during.&quot;  The awful experiences of the past  continue to dominate her life.  For much of this story she is awaiting a package from Stella, a package  that will contain the shawl : &quot;Magda's shawl! Magda's swaddling cloth.  Magda's shroud.&quot;<br />Stella is a difficult woman, loathing everyone and everything around her.  But then, who can blame  her ?  It is more a testament to the resilience of the human soul in general, than an indictment of this  particular character, that more of the survivors of the Holocaust were not so embittered.<br />GRADE : B	2001-04-26

The great police  procedurals (Adam Dalgleish, the 87th Precinct, etc.) assume that professional technique and relentless  work will solve the crime.  No matter how noir the private eye novel, there is an implicit message that,  though evil lurks just beneath the veneer of even the wealthiest family, and though the police and the  crooks may both try to stop him, there exists a special breed of modern knights errant who will sally  forth and do battle when we truly need them.  Then there are the mysteries of James Ellroy, in which  the evil has started to ooze out into public view, where the cops have been so desensitized by their  contact with that evil that they are often as brutal as the criminals, and where crimes are not  necessarily ever solved.<br />Ellroy's vision is so bleak, and his stories are so unsettling, that it's sometimes a relief just to finish  reading one, to get out from under his oppressive obsessions with violence and crime and corruption.<br />Black Dahlia is a particularly personal work, with the famous unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short in  1947 standing in for the tragic murder of Ellroy's own mother in 1958.  Similarly, the cop, Bucky  Bleichert, who is consumed by the case and descends into madness, eerily parallels Ellroy himself  (who has written about his own tortured fascination with his mother's slaying in My Dark Places).  Where we tend to read mysteries because we like to solve puzzles ands want the reassurance that good  triumphs over evil, Ellroy offers us instead unsolvable crime and the unsettling sensation that evil may  well triumph and that the good guys may be as dangerous as the bad guys.  His books aren't for the  squeamish--they are just too disturbing--but they are terrific if you can take it and Black Dahlia is a  good one to start with.<br />GRADE : A-br />GRADE : A-	2001-04-25

And he was there in the wilderness forty  days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.  -Gospel According to Mark 1: 12-13<br />This novel is the latest installment in a sub-genre of literature where the central conceit is to tell a story  from the point of view of the minor characters in a famous tale, with the more renowned stars of the  originals taking in subordinate roles.  Previous examples have included, Wide Sargasso Sea (derived  from Jane Eyre), Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (Hamlet), Man Friday (Robinson Crusoe),  Jack Maggs (Great Expectations), and so forth.  But Jim Crace has set his sights even higher than those  classics; in Quarantine he tells the story of Christ's forty days in the wilderness, but with Jesus shunted  to the periphery, in favor of several other pilgrims.  In particular, the novel focuses on a trader,  Musa--dishonest, loutish, and brutal--whom Jesus almost incidentally brings back to life from an  apparently fatal illness.  In turn it is only Musa, despicable as he is, who realizes that there is something  extraordinary about this young man from Galillee.<br />The novel is only partially successful, in large measure because this structural technique falls flat.  While Crace succeeds brilliantly in evoking the harsh atmosphere in which the quarantine takes place,  the narrative comes to a screeching halt whenever Jesus is absent.  Musa is simply too unpleasant a  character for us to care what happens to him and none of the others really grab our attention.  Nor can  their stories hope to compete with the action we know to be taking place away from center stage.<br />Crace's demystification of Jesus is not very effective either.  On the one hand he portrays Jesus as  merely an overly pious youth, estranged from his family because of his bizarre behavior, and says of  those who undertake this desert ordeal :<br />  This was the season of the lunatics: the first new moon of spring was summoning those men--for  lunatics are mostly men.  They have the time and opportunity--to exorcize that part of them which  sent them mad.  Mad with grief, that is. Or shame.  Or love.  Or illness and visions.  Mad enough to  think that everything they did, no matter how vain or trivial, was of interest to their god.  Mad  enough to think that forty days of discomfort could put their world in order.<br />The fact that Musa turns out to be such an unsuitable candidate for resurrection, defrauding his fellow  travelers and finally even raping one young woman, is probably intended to be an ironic comment on  the nature of &quot;miracles.&quot;  And the torments sent by Satan to test Jesus are revealed to be nothing but  petty annoyances foisted upon him by Musa.<br />But even with all that, the demands of Crace's own plot and very the things that drew him to this story  in the first place work against this kind of debunking.  The epigraph to the novel notes that a man  could not live past thirty days without food and water, and yet Jesus does.  The world might have been  a better place without Musa, and yet Jesus did revive him.  And Jesus may have been a lunatic, but his  &quot;discomforts&quot; did indeed bring a new order to the world.  There's a reason we only recall one of the  folks who was in the desert for those forty days; Messiah or not, he's the one who mattered.<br />This then is a novel that is certainly interesting, and sometimes quite powerful and even transporting,  but in trying to play up the experience while diminishing the experiencer it  gets at cross purposes with  itself.  For me at least, it just didn't quite work.<br />GRADE : CThis was the season of the lunatics: the first new moon of spring was summoning those men--for     lunatics are mostly men.

What If? games are inherently silly,  however fascinating, and they can't produce any certain answers, but consider the course that history  might have taken had the attack (or another like it) never occurred.  To an extent that Americans no  longer seem willing to concede--witness the hysterical reaction to Pat Buchanan's musings on the  subject--Pearl Harbor was the proximate cause of the United States' entry into World War II.  But for  the attack, it is entirely possible that America would have safely sat out the War.  This in turn would  have meant either a bloody stalemate between Nazi Germany and the USSR or victory by one,  followed by a debilitating attempt to control the European land mass.  Meanwhile, Japan would have  had a free hand to completely overextend itself in the South Pacific.  Ultimately, the victorious Axis  powers, and/or the Soviets, would have collapsed of their own weight.  The Cold War would have been  avoided and along with it the fifty year long economic displacement that the U. S. suffered through.  Or suppose that Japan had simply declared war before attacking : would the lack of the &quot;sneak&quot; in the  attack have made enough of an emotional difference for Americans not to have imprisoned our own  Japanese-American population or not to drop the atomic bombs on Japan ?  Well, you get the picture;  we're talkin' big, big deal here.<br />What makes this event all the more remarkable is how utterly futile it was.  Even if the bombings had  been completely successful and all the U. S. Naval ships in port that day had been destroyed  (in fact,  only two battleships, one target ship, and two destroyers were permanently lost), what good would that  have done Japanese war aims ?  At best it might have bought them a very little extra time in which to  try to expand, and thus further overextend, their Empire.  There was never any chance that the Japanese  could actually attack the American mainland, which meant that the U. S. would have the opportunity to  rebuild those ships at her leisure. And, once entered into the War, it was inevitable that the U. S. would  defeat Japan and Germany.  Pearl Harbor was essentially a national suicide mission by the Japanese.<br />One natural outgrowth of the importance of this episode is that for sixty years now there have been all  kinds of recriminations and conspiracy theories surrounding the events of December 7, 1941.  Volumes  have been written about what Roosevelt knew and when he knew it.  Ditto for Churchill.  U. S.  Intelligence services have taken a beating.  The various military commanders have been blamed.  And  so on, and so forth, with the unfortunate result that most versions of the day's events have some axe or  another to grind.<br />One exception to this rule is Walter Lord's thrilling moment-by-moment account of the attack in his  great book, Day of Infamy.  Ignoring all of the controversies and avoiding any finger pointing, Lord  simply reconstructs, as best anyone can, what happened on that fateful day.  His thoroughness is  staggering.  He interviewed some 577 participants, both Japanese and American,  and their recollections  give the story an extraordinary level of intimacy and immediacy (for a similar effect see a more recent  book on the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, In Harm's Way by Doug Stanton).  Though Lord  masterfully  imposes order on the material, these first hand accounts convey a sense of just how chaotic  things were during and after the bombings.  And he captures a sense of the violation that Americans  felt in the wake of the attack.  Standards of conduct in warfare have fallen so far since then that it's  easy to forget how outraged all of America was by this perfidious action.  Literally overnight, a healthy  and so far triumphant Isolationist movement dissipated, as even the most vocal advocates of staying out  of the War, voiced their commitment to avenging this wrong.<br />I've been a huge fan of Walter Lord's books since I was a kid. [In fact, I was shocked to hear that he's  still alive.]  In addition to this one, he's written excellent books about the sinking of the Titanic, A  Night to Remember, and about the War of 1812, The Dawn's Early Light.  Not that these are  specifically kids' books, but they have a couple of things that recommend them.  Lord writes clearly  and concisely.  Wherever possible he relies on the accounts of people who were there.  And, because he  doesn't seek to place blame or provoke argument, the stories are populated by heroes, rather than  goats.  Best of all they are truly exciting.  This sixtieth-anniversary edition of Day of Infamy has a  cover blurb saying that one million copies of the book have been sold; here's hoping they sell a million  more.<br />GRADE : Asipated, as even the most vocal advocates of staying out  of the War, voiced their commitment to avenging this wrong.  <br />I've been a huge fan of Walter Lord's books since I was a kid.

She is best known here for the movie Xiu Xiu : The Sent Down Girl, the  script for which she cowrote with director and childhood friend Joan Chen, from Yan's own short  story.  In this new novel, set in the 1870s, she has borrowed a figure from history, Fusang, the most  famous prostitute in San Francisco, and has imagined an unusual lover for her, a 12 year old white boy  named Chris.<br />Approaching the issue of anti-Chinese racism through these two characters, she tells a tale of slavery,  rape and murder, and, ostensibly, love.  I say ostensibly because Chris and Fusang remain completely  opaque throughout the novel; we can never comprehend their motivations or thought processes.  One of  the things that helps to make them so mysterious is that the novel is narrated by a female descendant of  Fusang, who has gathered 160 texts about the Chinese experience in San Francisco, in an effort to  understand her enigmatic ancestor's life.<br />I may well be wide of the mark here, but it seems like Yan's point may be that Fusang and Chris are  equally  incomprehensible to each other, as they are to us.  In fact, though the novel has the structure of  an epic love story, the message would seem to be that there is something fundamentally illusory in such  interracial love affairs.  At one point she says of Chris :<br />  He has yet to realize that the infatuation one feels for what one cannot understand is just as violent  as the animosity.<br />This linkage of racist hatred with cross-cultural romance, though awfully harsh, has more than a grain  of truth to it.  Equally stern is her later judgment of Chris, when he wants Fusang to marry him :<br />  It is as if being with you, Fusang, is not a matter of anything so shallow as love or happiness, but  rather a grand sacrifice.  Or perhaps when love reaches this stage it crowds out ordinary feelings  and becomes a doctrine, an ideal, that can only be realized through sacrifice.  He is using you to  enact his sacrifice for the ideal of love.  He also wants to show everyone of his race and yours that  his self-sacrifice will form a bridge across the racial divide.<br />It's hard to imagine a more stinging indictment of the kind of racial understanding which, though it  masquerades as selflessness and acceptance of others, is really based as much on objectification of those  &quot;others&quot; as is racism.<br />In what I found the most powerful passage of the book, which after all is an examination of racism and  violence directed against Chinese-Americans, Yan, in discussing the causes of a riot, reveals just how  universal and non-specific is the human hatred which fuels such incidents, and even links it to the  Cultural Revolution in China :<br />  Hatred is amazing.  It makes people self-righteous; it drives them with a sense of mission.  I'm not  talking about revenge; that's too simple.  People are born with a higher form of hatred, so immense  it doesn't even need a target.  Like love so vast no object is necessary.  This kind of hatred can lie  dormant for years, like a swell of darkness, and people are never even conscious of it.  But once the  darkness is breached, all rationality drowns and the things people do out of hatred serve only the  purpose of fulfilling an overwhelming emotional need.  Burning, smashing, killing, rape--they're all  just channels.  It doesn't even matter what started it, because people quickly become intoxicated by  the sheer spectacle of destruction.  Like love at the earth-shattering stage, hatred by this point feeds  on itself, simply for its own sake.  The pleasure of watching some person or thing destroyed by  one's own hand is virtually orgasmic.<br />  When I was a child I saw those sexual impulses they called the cultural revolution and those  orgasms they called rebellion.  The gratification of hatred produces the same rapture in everyone.<br />This is a very dark--though I would argue realistic--vision of human nature.<br />This darkness, combined with various scenes of violence, the emotional distance of the central  characters, the sparseness of the author's prose, make this a book that many people will not enjoy.  Quite honestly, I wasn't sure if I liked it until I thought about it for quite awhile.  But ultimately,  despite the somewhat harrowing nature of the story, the brutal honesty of Yan's ideas won me over.  And the more I've thought about it, the more I appreciate it.<br />GRADE : A-ld I saw those sexual impulses they called the cultural revolution and those     orgasms they called rebellion.

But much of the rest of the book is either juvenile or self-absorbed, or worst of all,  inaccurate.<br />The main influence on Shropshire appears to have been Ball Four; he seems to think the fact that  ballplayers (and coaches and sportswriters) drink, swear, and chase skirts, is both newsworthy and  hilarious.  He is mistaken.  (Though there is one piece of scatological humor that nearly makes the rest  worthwhile : the letters in the name &quot;Spiro Agnew&quot; can be rearranged to form the phrase &quot;Grow a  Penis&quot;)  He also apparently thinks that his own life is as compelling as the misadventures of the team he  was covering.  He is mistaken.  Finally, in recreating his thoughts, circa 1973, he summons up  memories of Attention Deficit Disorder, Leslie Nielsen as a comic airline pilot, and Victoria's Secret  Catalogues.  If he thinks these things would have been known to him in those years, he is mistaken.<br />Particularly given the material he had to work with, this is a disappointing book.<br />GRADE : C-	2001-04-19

He's physically vulnerable because both the crooks and the cops distrust him.  As  a result of which, he frequently ends up being beaten and battered.  He's emotionally vulnerable  because he's alone and prey to falling in love with clients or other women he meets in the course of the  case, or at least caring too much about the people whose lives he finds himself involved in.  As a result  of which, he frequently ends up heart broken.  Such are the Quixote-like characteristics that have  defined the genre.<br />Unfortunately, in recent years there's been a tendency on the part of authors to give their detectives  permanent girlfriends and overeager allies in law enforcement, which serves to allay both  vulnerabilities.  Call it the Robert Parker effect.  This trend has been so pervasive that only a very few  really good writers have been able to buck it : Loren Estleman, Jonathan Valin, and a few others.  Meanwhile, the most interesting new detective fiction has featured investigators in authoritarian  countries, where their vulnerability is greatly magnified : Martin Cruz Smith's Arkady Renko series and  Philip Kerr's Bernie Gunther series spring to mind, the one set in the USSR, the other in Nazi  Germany.<br />Which brings us to what I think is one of the best, and most unusual, private eye series of the modern  era.  Robert Irvine managed to create a fairly traditional private eye, an ex-football player, ex-soldier,  with the unlikely name of Moroni Traveler, and only gussy him up with a few emotional ties : a father  who may not be his biological dad, and a couple of street characters for friends.  Then he borrowed a  page from Smith and Kerr and set the stories in Salt Lake City, where Moroni's investigations often run  afoul of the Mormon Church, which essentially controls the state.  In addition to providing dramatic  tension, this setting in the land of the Latter Day Saints offers Irvine, himself of Mormon descent, an  opportunity to work Mormon history and beliefs into the narrative.<br />The resulting books are really fascinating, though I find them a tad too anti-Mormon, and Moroni and  his cronies are immensely likable.  They aren't all still in print and, though I couldn't find much  information online, I believe I recall reading that Irvine died a few years ago, but if you can find the  books, they are terrific.<br />GRADE : A, this setting in the land of the Latter Day Saints offers Irvine, himself of Mormon descent, an  opportunity to work Mormon history and beliefs into the narrative.<br />The resulting books are really fascinating, though I find them a tad too anti-Mormon, and Moroni and  his cronies are immensely likable.

For that alone he deserves our  attention and thanks.  But I found this collection of some of his older stuff in a remainder bin, most of  it culled from his years at TIME magazine, and it is not only quite good, it is a revelation.  John Leo is  truly funny.  All this time I'd assumed he was just a bitter old crank (and I mean that in a good way),  now it turns out that he's a talented satirist too.  I don't know that I'd put him in the exalted ranks of PJ  O'Rourke, Andrew Ferguson, and Christopher Buckley, but he certainly ranks just one rung below  them.<br />In addition to several excellent pieces on language, most of the book consists of Leo's comic colloquies  between Ralph and Wanda, a married couple he utilizes to play out the battle of the sexes.  Though he  initially made Wanda a mere foil for the loutish Ralph, he eventually let her more than hold her own in  their arguments.  The result is a set of very amusing social commentaries--which fairly well decimate  some of the sillier and trendier ideas of the Left--presented in the form of dialogues.  Some of the stuff  is, of course, dated (the title essay for instance refers to a specious old claim made by the Soviet  Union), but its almost all still fun, and well worth reading if you happen to find a copy.<br />GRADE : B	2001-04-15
2037165:US	52173832	R1T90S019J53EJ	0679779159	698950156	How Proust Can Change Your Life	Books	4	10	30	N	N	better than the subject	Marcel Proust, like his fellow modernist icons, Kafka and Joyce, produced a literature which is entirely personal, devoid of the kind of universality which had, up until their time, characterized the Western Canon.  If it is a coincidence, it is a revelatory one, that the key moment in Swann's Way, if not in all of In Search of Lost Time, comes with a perversion of the Communion.  A bite of madeleine and a sip of tea sends Proust's narrator/Proust reeling back through the years, turns him entirely inwards, and inundates him with personal memories and feelings.  During this reverie, Proust's older self essentially communes with his younger self, or selves.  Here we have the individual, whole unto himself, needing only his own feelings and memories to find those things which give his life meaning.<br />This stands thousands of years of the Judeo-Christian tradition on its head.  It has been the dream of Western man, and a noble one, that we might rise beyond purely personal concerns and achieve something together as a species, achieve one day a kind of godhood ourselves.  In no small part, it is this shared dream, and its requirement of communality, which has led us to create the liberal protestant capitalist democratic institutions which have made possible social progress over the past several centuries.  Though these institutions vindicate individual rights, they are focussed on the ways in which men can co-exist and work together.  Each in its own way is premised on the Golden Rule : Do unto others as you would have done unto you.  Each of us, as individuals, will reap the benefit of the general adherence to this stricture, but it is primarily concerned with how we behave towards others.  Similarly, during the Communion we turn not inwards but outwards, remembering the sacrifice that Christ made, taking our sinfulness upon himself, that we might approach closer to God.<br />It is unsurprising then that the 20th Century, with Proust (and Darwin and Nietzsche and Freud and Marx and Joyce) leading the intellectual way, saw the near collapse of Judeo-Christian tradition and Western institutions and a descent into barbarism, as people acted out the ideas of the vanguard, with every man seeking only his own self interest.  What is surprising is that so many chose to listen to the utter blather of such men.  And none of those men, bizarre as they generally were, made a more unlikely prophet than Proust.<br />A truly curious conceit animates the cult of Proust, the belief that the very characteristics which made Marcel Proust so completely aberrant, also made him uniquely perceptive about the human condition. Here's how de Botton puts it :<br />  The magnitude of Proust's misfortunes should not be allowed to cast doubt on the validity of his  ideas.<br />  ...<br />  Though philosophers have traditionally been concerned with the pursuit of happiness, far greater  wisdom would seem to lie in pursuing ways to be properly and productively unhappy. The stubborn  recurrence of misery means that the development of a workable approach to it must surely outstrip  the value of any utopian quest for happiness. Proust, a veteran of grief, knew as much.<br />Meanwhile, here's as good a one sentence description of Proust as I could find :<br />  A mother's boy who never really grew up, a part-genuine, part-imaginary invalid totally incapable  of looking after himself, a reluctant homosexual who may never have known genuine fulfillment, he  spent his early manhood in Parisian high society and then retired, hermit-like, to his famous  cork-lined room, where he turned day into night and night into day.  -John Weightman, Books Unlimited review of  How Proust Can Change Your Life<br />Okay, so that would make him a gay, hypochondriacal, mama-loving, French, recluse.  And it necessarily raises the question : what does someone who was little more than a bundle of neuroses--someone who seemingly incorporated most of the pathologies of a 20th Century which we generally consider to have been a blood soaked disaster--have to tell us about life in general ?<br />Alain de Botton believes Proust has quite a bit to tell us, and he tries mightily to make Proust seem pertinent to our lives.  In effect, de Botton reads In Search of Lost Time as a huge self help manual.  This is often very funny, and is presumably intended to be ironic, but is ultimately unconvincing.  The many stories he tells about Proust and about contemporary reaction to his writing are quite amusing, but he can never quite get us convincingly past that first big hurdle : Proust was simply too screwed up for us to accept that he has much to say to us.  Having successfully turned inward himself, he found nothing but himself, and an unpleasant self at that.  The resulting fiction is necessarily idiosyncratic and personal, rather than universal.  In the end, all Proust really had to say was what it was like to be Proust, which does not seem to have been a particularly enjoyable experience.  Combine that with the fact that he said it in the most stultifyingly boring fashion and at interminable length and there's just no compelling reason to read him.<br />Each chapter of de Botton's book is based on something he maintains Proust can teach us, and the final chapter is called &quot;How to Put Books Down.&quot; One has to assume that this is intentionally humorous on de Botton's part, because there may be no other author who has forced as many readers to put his book's down as Proust.  They are truly unreadable, as the comments of even his friends and family acknowledge.  If, like me, you feel some obligation to at least familiarize yourself with Proust's work, do yourself a huge favor and read How Proust Can Change Your Life instead of the original novels.  Despite its ostensible intent, it will cure you of any desire to pick up a Proustian tome in the first place.<br />GRADE : B+orated most of the pathologies of a 20th Century which we generally consider to have been a blood soaked disaster--have to tell us about life in general ? <br />Alain de Botton believes Proust has quite a bit to tell us, and he tries mightily to make Proust seem pertinent to our lives.

Writing before free agency made players millionaires and anticipating such groundbreaking tell-alls as False Spring and Ball Four, Harris treated sports realistically--players are work a day drudges who have off season jobs and swear and drink and womanize, management cares about little other than the bottom line, matters off the field effect performances on the field, etc.  This honest approach, distinctive narrative voice and poignant subject matter combine to make this an unforgettable novel.<br />I'm sure even most folks who haven't read the book have seen the movie.  Henry Wiggen, star left handed pitcher for the NY Mammoths, is called to Rochester, MN to pick up his roommate Bruce Pearson, the team's third string catcher.  Pearson has just found out that he is dying from Hodgkin's Lymphoma (which is now often survivable).  Henry who has always had a difficult relationship with Pearson, mostly because the catcher is such a simpleton, takes on a sort of protectors role, even ending his contract holdout with the club in exchange for a contract clause saying that Bruce can not be cut.  As the season unfolds, both Henry ends up having a career year and Bruce too begins to play well, Henry's sudden friendship (including even teaching him the game of TEGWAR--The Exciting Game Without Any Rules) giving him increased confidence in himself, and the team hangs around first place.  Then as fellow players begin to find out about Bruce's condition, they too lay off of riding Bruce and they start to gel as a team.  Finally though,  Henry gets a call from Red Traphagen, the team's retired catcher, now teaching school in San Francisco.  When Red tells him that the club has wired him several emergency contract offers, Henry knows that club management has found out about the illness.  They call Author up to a suite of the team's hotel to try Mau-Mauing him into releasing them from the clause and while he's there Dutch telephones Red.  Their conversation provides a nice illustration of the unique patois that Harris utilizes:<br />  Dutch said: &quot;How much can I offer?&quot;<br />  &quot;The sky is the limit,&quot; said Patricia, &quot;but use good taste.&quot;<br />  &quot;Hello there, old pal,&quot; said Dutch.<br />  &quot;Hello there yourself,&quot; said Red.  I could hear his voice but I could not hear the words.  &quot;It would all  sound fine to me,&quot; said Red, &quot;except I can not leave here.  They can not find another man on such  short notice.&quot;<br />  &quot;To do what?&quot; said Dutch.  &quot;They can find 40,000 men in a minute.&quot;<br />  &quot;I am making money hand over fist out here,&quot; said Red.<br />  &quot;Horsefeathers,&quot; said Dutch.  &quot;Nobody makes money in such a racket but the football coach.  I will  up it 33 1/3 % and not one penny more.&quot;<br />  &quot;I can not stand the noise andthe excitement,&quot; said Red.  &quot;I quit it for good and never miss it and  am glad to be done with it.  Keep it and best of luck.&quot;<br />  &quot;Very well,&quot; said Dutch, &quot;I am sorry to troubled you.&quot;<br />  &quot;Goodby&quot;, said Red.<br />  &quot;Goodby,&quot; said Dutch.<br />  &quot;Goodby&quot;, said Red.<br />  &quot;I will up it 16 2/3 % more,&quot; said Dutch.  &quot;That is twice the first wire plus 33 1/3 % plus 16 2/3 %.  I am under orders to go no higher.&quot;<br />  &quot;Sold,&quot; said Red, and Dutch hung up.  &quot;Somebody remember and can Diego Roberto when Red  hits town,&quot; he said.  &quot;Every cloud got its silver lining.&quot;<br />Henry, of course, refuses to let the team off of the hook. The team ends up winning the pennant and World Series, but Bruce sickens and has to leave the team before the end of the season.<br />On October 7, Henry gets the call from Bruce's father informing him that Bruce has died.  Henry offers this affecting epitaph:<br />  In my Arcturus Calendar for October 7 it says, &quot;De Soto visited Georgia, 1540.&quot;  This hands me a  laugh.  Bruce Pearson also visited Georgia.

You'll recall the Robert Shaw character telling about being adrift in the  waters of the Pacific as sharks circled and attacked the helpless men.  This story has such a compelling  fascination that it has spawned a series of books, documentaries and even a TV movie.  Doug Stanton's  new account can take its place with the very best of them.  Drawing heavily on interviews with  survivors and on Captain Charles Butler McVay's account of the sinking and the ensuing ordeal,  Stanton presents the story with an immediacy and intimacy that makes it all the more terrible.<br />The men of the Indianapolis were the victims of an entire series of oversights and foul ups, few of  their own making.  First, the ship had just delivered components of the Little Boy atomic bomb  (which was dropped on Hiroshima), and so had been traveling in great secrecy.  Then when they set  out from Guam to join up with Task Force 95 at Okinawa, they sailed alone and were not warned  about known Japanese submarine activity, for security reasons.  Thus, when the submarine I-58,  commanded by Mochitsura Hashimoto, torpedoed them, they didn't even realize what had happened at  first.<br />From there, unfortunate coincidence turns to bitter irony and real tragedy.  Damage to the radio rooms  was so great and the ship sank so fast, that they did not get a chance to radio for help.  Meanwhile,  again for security reasons, port authorities had been ordered not to relay messages every time a ship  arrived and had interpreted the order to mean that they shouldn't report non-arrivals either.  Of the  1196 men on board, 300 probably died immediately, but while the other 900 struggled in the water, no  one yet knew of their dilemma.<br />Eventually sharks, salt water, hypothermia, injuries sustained in the sinking, fights among the men,  and a host of other maladies, left just 321 men alive to be rescued, four of whom died almost  immediately.  Stanton renders the crew's five day holocaust in heart breaking detail, with much of the  narrative supplied by ship's doctor Lewis Haynes and Private Giles McCoy.  Finally, as even these  stalwart souls were preparing to give up, they were discovered by Lieutenant Commander George  Atteberry in a Ventura bomber, which could do little more than drop some supplies and radio for  help.  He was followed by Lieutenant Adrian Marks in a PBY-5A Catalina, which Marks heroically set  down in the water.  Marks and a few succeeding planes were able to start picking up the survivors  while they waited for rescue ships to reach the scene.<br />One would think that the awful story had run its course at that point, but the Navy added insult to  tragedy by court-martialing Captain McVay, the only captain to that point in US Naval history to be  court-martialed for losing being sunk.  The Navy, pretty clearly trying to avoid admitting its own  mistakes, failed to share much information which would have been helpful to his defense and took the  extraordinary step of summoning Commander Hashimoto to testify about the incident.  The  prosecution's theory of the case was that McVay's failure to zig-zag had been responsible for the  sinking, and, despite contrary testimony from both Hashimoto and the prosecution's own expert  witness on this issue, he was convicted.<br />In the succeeding years crew members gathered for reunions (organized by McCoy) and worked to  clear McVay's name.  These efforts went for naught until a High School student in Florida, working  on a class project, got involved.  On October 12, 2000, Congress passed an amendment exonerating  McVay and recommending citations for the crew.  It was too late for McVay though, he had killed  himself in 1968.<br />This is a terrific book, filled with all the drama you could ever ask for, remarkable moments of human  endurance and despair, stupidity and loyalty, heroism and despair.  I'm not big on all of the current  Greatest Generation stuff, but there is something to the idea that the shared experience of war (and  Depression) that this generation shared somehow gives them a common identity and a sense of  accomplishment that their successors have lacked.  The men of the USS Indianapolis and particularly  their captain, Charles McVay, are deserving of our respect and their story should never be forgotten.  Doug Stanton's book makes it a painful pleasure to remember the sacrifices they made.<br />GRADE : Ad loyalty, heroism and despair.

Whatever virtues this state may possess, hipness is not  one of them. Fred MacMurray may be an admirable paterfamilias and a model of bourgeois  rectitude, but he will not win the dance contest on Soul Train.<br />  The Right has a serious fun problem. Like evil runes possessed of a curious power, the words  carved on the id of every teenager worth her salt -- sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll -- send conservatives  into a howling, medieval fury.  The inconvenient fact is that all hipness contains a spice of nihilism,  a tiny but flavorful soupcon of who-gives-a-****, that is anathema to the Right. To the degree that  conservative writers embrace Cool Style, they simply cease to be conservative.  -REVIEW : of &quot;Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing,&quot; edited by David  Brooks (GARY KAMIYA, Salon)<br />That statement is, I suppose, fairly typical of how the Left views conservatives, and may in fact be  largely true.  But it misses two extremely salient points : (1) those who do embrace Cool Style cease to  be humorous, after all, if you think it's perfectly fine to engage in wildly varied sexual  experimentation, then 99% of the jokes ever told in the history of man, particularly those with sheep  in them, no longer have punch lines; (2) no the Right isn't out having this sort of fun, we're home with  our wives making jokes about the hipster doofuses that think that such behavior makes them cool.  [Recall the hilarious Republican response to Ted Kennedy's 1988 Democratic convention speech,  where he used the tagline &quot;Where was George ?&quot;  Answer : Home in bed with Barbara, sober.]  Humor, particularly satirical humor, by its very nature, requires you to take a pretty jaundiced view of  humankind; it practically requires the stance of Permanent Moral Disapproval, which Kamiya finds so  offensive.  The natural result is that almost all of the humorous political writing in America today is  being done by conservatives.  The collection that is panned above, for instance, includes an  embarrassment of riches, including Joe Queenan, PJ O'Rourke, Andrew Ferguson, and Christopher  Buckley.<br />Wry Martinis meanwhile is a collection of twenty years worth of the writings of Christopher  Buckley--an editor at Forbes FYI, regular contributor to the back page of The New Yorker, former  speech writer to Vice President Bush, and the son of William F. Buckley.  The book contains many  funny pieces ranging from travel essays to book reviews.  Among the funniest are his NY Times  review of Tom Clancy's novel Debt of Honor, which is so scathing that it provoked a mini-feud  between the two.  It starts by citing Mark Twain :<br />  Somewhere, if memory serves, Mark Twain said of one of Henry James's books, &quot;Once you put it  down, you can't pick it up.&quot; &quot;Debt of Honor,&quot; the eighth novel in Tom Clancy's oeuvre, is, at 766  pages, a herniating experience.<br />And things get really ugly thereafter.  One of Buckley's favorite devices, especially in his New Yorker  bits, is to take one seemingly innocent item out of the news and then spin a comedic scenario around  it.  Among the factoids that get this treatment :<br />  * 'They both come to my house.  We serve them a Martini.  And we have an exchange between  the two.'  -Tom Brokaw in The New York Times, proposing an alternative presidential-debate format<br />  *  A group of conservative political operatives is expected to announce today the launching of the  Conservative TV Network, a 24-hour pay cable-television channel expected to debut in early  1996.  -USA Today<br />  *  To save money, airlines in the United States are circulating less fresh air into the cabins of many  airplanes.  -The New York Times<br />These brief essays are generally very funny, but even better, the modus operandi set him up to  perpetrate a terrific hoax.  In  Forbes FYI, he started out a piece with a seemingly similar blurb :<br />  It has come to our attention through private channels that the Soviet government is preparing to  make a very unusual, indeed unprecedented, offering : the embalmed remains of V.

My grandfather spent his whole life in Brooklyn and he loved the place.  His apartment walls were  lined with etchings of the city's buildings and landmarks by the now largely forgotten artist Joseph  Pennell.  Several times he took us to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, which we often drove over  when we went to visit them from New Jersey.  So I, like David McCullough, and Ken Burns who  made a nice film about it, and many New Yorkers, have always loved the Bridge.  In a city which long  ago came to be dominated by modernistic skyscrapers, the Bridge is such an obvious throwback, with  its stonework, web of steel cables, and gothic arches, it just looks like it has a tale to tell.<br />In this outstanding book, McCullough tells that tale--of how the bridge came to be built (from 1869 to  1883) and of the extraordinary difficulties, both man-made and natural, that had to be overcome.  The  story starts with the post-Civil War social milieu that gave rise to the project and the recognition on  the part of the powers that be in Brooklyn that they had to be physically joined to Manhattan to keep  pace in the emerging industrial world.  The design for the project and the initial phases of building are  largely the product of one unusual man, John Rebelling.  In particular, the structure, much longer than  any prior suspension bridge and required to bear significantly greater weight, was made possible by the  steel cabling which Roebling himself had perfected.  By contrast, the greatest challenges he faced  mostly stemmed from corruption; recall that this was Tammany Hall era New York.<br />John Roebling was ably assisted by his son Washington, who took over the project when his father  died, as a result of a poorly treated injury (the elder Roebling believed in hydrotherapy among his  many odd ideas) sustained during construction of the bridge.  Washington was also physically  debilitated by his bridge work, one of the many victims of the greatest challenge that he faced : caisson  sickness.<br />If you remember the grade school experiment where you put a tissue in the bottom of a cup, then press  the cup (mouth down) to the bottom of a sink full of water, and when you lift out the cup the tissue is  still dry, you'll understand the basic concept of the pneumatic caisson.  Huge wooden structures were  built and pressed down to the bottom of the East River, air pressure keeping the water from flowing  in.  Men worked inside of these caissons, digging out river bottom to get down to bedrock, upon  which they intended to moor the arches.  However, when bedrock on one side of the river proved  much deeper than predicted they were forced to keep going lower and lower and tremendous difficulty  began occurring with men sickening and even dying, from what we now know to be the bends.<br />Washington Roebling was himself struck down by this condition. He went for years without ever even  visiting the Bridge, though he could see it from his apartment window.  But the Roebling family had  yet another remarkable builder ready to take over, in this case, his wife.<br />Between these three formidable characters, and a host of other interesting folks who pop up in the  narrative, the bold and enduring design of the Bridge, and the obstacles that had to be tackled,  McCullough has all the materials for a thrilling story and he does not disappoint.  If the Brooklyn  Bridge was a part of your childhood too, you owe it to yourself to read this book.  Even if you don't  care a wit about it, you'll marvel at the Roeblings' accomplishment.  And if you live near Boston and  you've grown distraught watching the disastrous Big Dig, you'll wonder where folks like the Roeblings  are when we need them.<br />GRADE : A+d : caisson  sickness.  <br />If you remember the grade school experiment where you put a tissue in the bottom of a cup, then press  the cup (mouth down) to the bottom of a sink full of water, and when you lift out the cup the tissue is  still dry, you'll understand the basic concept of the pneumatic caisson.

Calculating selfishness is the annihilation of self.  -Madeleine L'Engle, Two-Part Invention, quoting Chekov?<br />Madeleine L'Engle, author of the beloved Newberry Award winner A Wrinkle in Time (see Orrin's  review) here tells the genuinely moving story of her forty year marriage to the actor Hugh Franklin,  an early star of All My Children, and of his agonizing death from cancer.  The book is at its very best  describing the commitment that marriage requires of people, the commitment to one another which  makes so vital an institution.  At one point she asks :<br />  [I]f Hugh dies first, would I ever be able to stop saying 'we' and say 'I'?  I doubt it.  I do not think  that death can take away the fact that Hugh and I are 'we' and 'us,' a new creature born at the time  of our marriage vows, which has grown along with us as our marriage has grown.  Even during the  times, inevitable in all marriages, when I have felt angry, or alienated, the instinctive 'we' remains.<br />This kind of selfless devotion to another and to a relationship is so rare and precious in our ever more  atomized culture, that to see two people who realize it so fully is really edifying.<br />Oddly enough, though it is probably one of the things she is best known for, I found her religious  musings less effective.  Her God is entirely too much a personal God, as she seeks to justify his ways  to herself.  Likewise, her comparisons of Hugh to Christ, and of his cancer to the crucifixion, seemed  a little over the top to me.<br />Lastly, though Ms L'Engle seems like a perfectly decent woman, perhaps even an unusually decent  one, her intermittent forays into political questions are disturbingly misguided.  As she tells about a  trip to China during which the United States bombed Libya and she felt compelled to apologize to  people she met in the street, the reader can hardly suppress a desire to see someone dope slap her.  She  is after all speaking to people who live under Communist oppression, apologizing for a democracy's  measured response to the provocations of another totalitarian dictatorship.<br />But let's set these objections aside for now, and just consider the book as a portrait of a loving  marriage and of the maintenance that even a love-filled marriage requires.  Here it succeeds and is so  successful that one wishes all young married couples, or prospective couples, would read it.  She does  not try to sugarcoat her life or her marriage; she presents them with all their rough spots intact.  The  message that comes shining through is that the life has been infinitely better because of the marriage  and because that life was shared with Hugh.  In one of my favorite passages she acknowledges :<br />  We were not a latter-day Heloise and Abelard, Pelleas and Melisande when we married.  For one  thing, the Heloises and Abelards, the Pelleases and Melisandes, do not get married and stay married  for forty years.  A love which depends solely on romance, on the combustion of two attracting  chemistries, tends to fizzle out.  The famous lovers usually end up dead.  A long term marriage has  to move beyond chemistry to compatibility, to friendship, to companionship.  It is certainly not that  passion disappears, but that it is conjoined with other ways of love.<br />Of course, the culture tends to glorify the passionate whirlwind romance, rather than the steady  committed marriage.  Anyone fortunate enough to share in the latter, to enjoy true love, realizes how  empty is the former.<br />GRADE : C+the reader can hardly suppress a desire to see someone dope slap her.

As a result, I've not only read all of his books, his name is also one of the few whose  appearance in The New Yorker's Table of Contents suffices by itself to get me to buy the magazine.<br />Since 1962, which was fortuitously the inaugural year of the Mets, Mr. Angell has written several  baseball essays a year for The New Yorker.  There's always one on Spring Training and one on the  World Series, then a couple of mid-season updates.  The earliest pieces, covering the years 1962 to  1972, were collected in The Summer Game (1973). Subsequent five year chunks appeared in Five  Seasons (1978),  Late Innings (1982), and Season Ticket (1988), then came Once More Around the  Park (1991), which mostly reprinted selections from those prior volumes, all of which are,  disgracefully, out of print.<br />Baseball has attracted an extravagantly talented assortment of writers but no one has ever written more  beautifully about the intricacies and every day charms of the game than Angell, nor captured the  idiosyncrasies of individual players in greater detail.  It's impossible to match his prose, so let's allow  him to speak for himself :<br />  *  Any baseball is beautiful. No other small package comes as close to the ideal in design and  utility.  It is a perfect object for a man's hand. Pick it up and it instantly suggests its purpose: it is meant to  be thrown a considerable distance-thrown hard and with precision. Its feel and heft are the  beginning of the sport's critical dimensions; if it were a fraction of an inch larger or smaller, a few  centigrams heavier or lighter, the game of baseball would be utterly different.  Hold a baseball in  your hand ... Feel the ball, turn it over in your hand; hold it across the seam or the other way, with  the seam just to the side of your middle finger. Speculation stirs. You want to get outdoors and  throw this spare and sensual object to somebody or, at the very least, watch somebody else throw  it.  The game has begun.  -&quot;On the Ball&quot;, Five Seasons<br />  * Baseball's clock ticks inwardly and silently, and a man absorbed in a ball game is caught in a  slow, green place of removal and concentration and in a tension that is screwed up slowly and ever  more tightly with each pitcher's windup and with the almost imperceptible forward lean and little  half-step with which the fielders accompany each pitch... Any persistent effort to destroy this  unique phenomenon, to &quot;use up&quot; baseball's time with planned distractions, will in fact transform the  sport into another mere entertainment and thus hasten its descent to the status of a boring and  stylized curiosity.  -The Summer Game<br />  * Since baseball time is measured only in outs, all you have to do is succeed utterly; keep hitting,  keep the rally alive, and you have defeated time. You remain forever young.  -&quot;The Interior Stadium&quot;, The Summer Game<br />  * The box score, being modestly arcane, is a matter of intense indifference, if not irritation, to the  non-fan. To the baseball-bitten, it is not only informative, pictorial, and gossipy but lovely in  aesthetic structure. It represents happenstance and physical flight exactly translated into figures and  history. Its totals - batters' credit vs. pitchers' debit - balance as exactly as those in an accountant's  ledger. And a box score is more than a capsule archive. It is a precisely etched miniature of the  sport itself, for baseball, in spite of its grassy spaciousness and apparent unpredictability, is the most  intensely and satisfyingly mathematical of all our outdoor sports. Every player in every game is  subjected to a cold and ceaseless accounting; no ball is thrown and no base is gained without an  instant responding judgment - ball or strike, hitor error, yea or nay - and an ensuing statistic. This  encompassing neatness permits the baseball fan, aided by experience and memory, to extract from a  box score the same joy, the same hallucinatory reality, that pickles the scalp of a musician when he  glances at a page of his score of Don Giovanni and actually hears bassos and sopranos, woodwinds  and violins.  -&quot;Box Scores&quot;, The Summer Game<br />  * This is a linear sport. Something happens and then something else happens, and then the next  man comes up and digs in at the plate. Here's the pitch, and here, after a pause, is the next. There's  time to write it down in your scorecard or notebook, and then perhaps to look about and reflect on  what's starting to happen out there now. It's not much like the swirl and blur of hockey and  basketball, or the highway crashes of the NFL.<br />  Baseball is the writer's game, and its train of thought, we come to sense, is a shuttle, carrying us  constantly forward to the next pitch or inning, or the sudden double into the left-field corner, but  we keep hold of the other half of our ticket, for the return trip on the same line. We anticipate  happily, and, coming home, reenter an old landscape brightened with fresh colors. Baseball games  and plays and mannerisms-the angle of a cap-fade stubbornly and come to mind unbidden, putting  us back in some particular park on that special October afternoon or June evening. The players are  as young as ever, and we, perhaps not entirely old.  -Once More Around the Park<br />  * There are baseball fans, it must be admitted, who don't like Tim McCarver's stuff. After they've  listened to the celebrated baseball analyst working another World Series game, say, or a Fox  Saturday Baseball Game of the Week, or a WNYW Yankees game, with Bobby Murcer, or, before  that for many years, a Mets yawner or triumph with Ralph Kiner as sidekick, certain friends of  mine have found fault. A few of them sound apologetic about it, as if they have failed Tim  somehow; others plain can't stand him. Because I don't understand any of this, I have been at pains  to listen to their whinings, which can be easily summarized: Tim McCarver likes to talk. He laughs  and enjoys himself at ballgames. He makes jokes -- puns, even.  He uses fancy words. He's excitable  -- he gets carried away by the baseball. He's always going on and on about some little thing. He  thinks he knows how the game should be played. He knows too much.  -&quot;The Bard in the Booth&quot;, The New Yorker, September 6, 1999<br />There are of course those philistines who dislike baseball, and even baseball fans who simply dislike  this kind of myth-tinged writing about the game.  For the rest of us, the essays of Roger Angell are a  must.<br />We've had a particularly tough winter here in New England--as I write, it is March 31st and we just  got another foot of snow.  But pick up any one of Roger Angell's books, turn to just about any one of  his essays (though you might want to avoid a few of those in Late Innings, when he got caught up in  the hysteria over rising salaries and free agency), read one of his descriptions of a play or a player and  he effortlessly transports you into that Interior Stadium.  There are really only two sports that live on  in our minds : golf and baseball.  In fact, many years ago I learned a trick to help you get to sleep if  you're having trouble--as you lay abed, either play eighteen holes at your favorite course or figure out  how you would pitch to your favorite team for nine innings.  It's no coincidence that these two sports,  which have lent themselves to most of the truly great literature of sport, are the two which can be  summoned thus in the imagination.<br />Roger Angell's writing is so evocative, it too seems to tap into your store of memories,--of players,  plays, and games--enabling you to visualize most of the scenes he writes about.  Writing in general,  and sports writing in particular, just doesn't get any better than this.<br />GRADE : A+re     that for many years, a Mets yawner or triumph with Ralph Kiner as sidekick, certain friends of     mine have found fault.

In this uncomfortable blend of existentialism and the picaresque novel, James &quot;Jake&quot; Donaghue is an  aspiring, though incorrigibly lazy, writer.  He makes a living, barely, by translating French works into  English and he stays in the flats of friends.  As the novel opens Jake is informed that he, and his man  Friday, Peter &quot;Finn&quot; O'Finney, must move out of their current address, because Madge, who has been  letting them stay there, has found herself a fianc&eacute;.  Over the course of the rest of the book, the  flat-broke Jake desperately seeks for ways to avoid having to do any work and for places to stay  courtesy of his friends.  Much of the story is taken up with his broken friendship with Hugo  Belfounder, a philosopher turned moviemaker (apparently based on Ludwig Wittgenstein), whose  theories Jake presented in somewhat bastardized form in one of the few books he actually wrote  himself.  Another subplot involves a dognapping of an animal which is an unlikely film-star.  The book  ends, as it began, with Jake broke, not writing, and looking for a place to stay.<br />I suppose some of the scenarios in the book are amusing if you are British and are immersed in the  works of philosophers like Wittgenstein.  For the rest of us, it's all rather tedious.  A picaresque where  neither the central character nor any of the people he comes in contact with show any signs of personal  growth and development seems an exercise in futility.  Personally, I agree with the friend of Jake's who  suggests :<br />  Society should take you by the neck and shake you and make you do a sensible job.  Then in your  evenings you would have the possibility to write a great book.<br />To the extent that Jake in this sense embodies all of England between the Wars and the rise of Margaret  Thatcher, I suppose you could interpret the book as depicting the adverse effects of the dole mentality  on British culture.<br />But Iris Murdoch apparently intends the book to convey a somewhat more existentialist message.  As  she says :<br />  All work and all love, the search for wealth and fame, the search for truth, like itself, are made up  of moments which pass and become nothing.  Yet through this shaft of nothings we drive onward  with that miraculous vitality that creates our precarious habitations in the past and future.  So we  live; a spirit that broods and hovers over the continual death of time, the lost meaning, the  unrecaptured moment, the unremembered face, until the final chop that ends all our moments and  plunges that spirit back into the void from which it came.<br />Here I come back to my eternal quarrel with existentialism : if it's all pointless anyway, then why in the  name of God do you spend your time writing about it, and for what earthly reason should I waste my  time reading what you write ?<br />I must admit myself to be at a complete loss to explain the presence of this novel on the Modern  Library Top 100 list.

E.B. White, a funny writer himself, once said that analyzing  humor is like dissecting a frog, in that the thing tends to die in the process and the results will be  interesting only to the purely scientific mind.  -Andrew Ferguson, Divine Comedy : P.G. Wodehouse's perfect pitch<br />Two things the critics generally agree on are that : (1) P. G. Wodehouse is one of the funniest writers  in the English language; and, (2)  it's almost impossible to explain why.  Among the various  authorities cited for the difficulty in analyzing humor are Evelyn Waugh and Sigmund Freud,  themselves authors of hilarious fictions.  Suffice it to say, and I mean this in the very best sense, the  enjoyments of the Jeeves and Wooster stories are much the same as those of the great TV sitcoms.  Wodehouse created these two great comic characters, surrounded them in each story with oddballs,  plunked them all down in trying situations, and then had the inimitable Jeeves extract Bertie and his  upper-class nitwit friends from their difficulties through various stratagems and diversions.  Though  Andrew Ferguson and others deny that there is any deeper meaning or political content to the stories, it  is at least notable that the finest young gentlemen in all of England are hopelessly overmatched by life  unless Jeeves steps in to save them.  The resulting stories have a certain sameness to them--of course,  just try watching ten episodes of Cheers in a row and see if it's still fresh and amusing in hour  five--but read in moderation they are immensely enjoyable and their very familiarity becomes quite  comforting.<br />GRADE : A+	2001-03-30

The Kraffts,  Glicken, and many of the journalists were killed in seconds, their lungs scorched and robbed of air  by plugs of ash and mucous, their bodies flash-burned by the heat.  -Stanley Williams and Fen Montaigne, Surviving Galeras<br />It's easy enough to see why this book set off a bidding war among publishers anxious to print what  seems sure to be a bestseller.  Stanley Williams is a volcanologist who in 1993 was nearly killed in an  eruption on the slopes of the active volcano Galeras in Colombia, an event which did kill several of his  fellow geologists and a few local sightseers.  As Williams lay on the ground, one leg nearly severed  and his skull fractured after being pelted by flying rubble, two female colleagues led the effort to  rescue him.  In addition to telling the story of his near death and rehabilitation, offers a fairly  thorough look at the natural history of volcanoes, the history of volcanology, and the state of the  science.  Williams also warns of the potentially devastating impact that a major eruption might have,  particularly because population pressures have moved large numbers of people into ever closer  proximity to active volcanoes.  It's a blend of rousing adventure and popular science that has become  familiar in such books as The Perfect Storm, Longitude, Into Thin Air, Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue  Sea, The Last River, and many other recent books.<br />Surviving Galeras is at least as good as most of these rivals, in fact, the volcanology is interesting  enough to make it worthwhile reading even without the obligatory &quot;tragedy.&quot;  I'm of the opinion that  by now these self inflicted tragedies have worn themselves fairly thin.  Stanley Williams estimates that  there about 300 serious volcanologists in the world and in the past twenty one years (1979 to 2000)  twenty three have been killed by volcanic activity.  I've nothing like the background necessary to  criticize the methods used by Williams and others, but of this I am certain, you could get most of the  measurements that they are getting by walking around these craters if you used passive instrumentation  or some kind of remote controlled devices.  This is after all the approach used on the Moon and Mars  and elsewhere.  From what I gather, all they are really doing up there is measuring seismic activity,  gravitational and magnetic forces, and the chemical composition of gas releases.  It simply doesn't  seem imperative that a geologist be squatting there with a vapor hood capturing fumes when a remote  control car (obviously you'd have to do some reengineering on it; I'm aware that you couldn't just use  one you picked up in the toy section at K-Mart) could do the job equally well and much more safely.<br />Instead, the strong suggestion given off by this book is that it is a matter of machismo and lifestyle for  volcanologists to do their work on site.  Thus, Williams says :<br />  There are geologists, and then there are volcanologists.  Only a few hundred scientists work on  active volcanoes worldwide, and we share a strong esprit de corps.  Within this community there  are those who study dead volcanoes and those who climb on living volcanoes.  My colleagues  who've never set foot on an active volcano have made great contributions, but the best work, I  believe, comes from those of us who walk into the crater.<br />Well, I suppose that could be true, but I bet there are perfectly competent geologists, who never leave  the lab, who could just look at the measurements that are gathered from these sites and produce equally  useful theories about what's going on.  The real point of being a volcanologist seems to be entangled as  much with the great field trips and the bravado of the work as with the underlying science.  And that's  fine, but it does take some of the edge off of the tragedy to realize that in a genuine sense it need not  have happened, absent the scientists search for thrills.<br />This is a book to be enjoyed much more for the quite fascinating science and scientific history it  contains than for the by now routine adventure tale, which is sure to be its major selling point on the  book promotion circuit.  As these stories pile on top of each other, and on top of us poor readers, I  find myself losing patience with the folks who take these risks.  Stanley Williams has a really  interesting story to tell--and with the help of coauthor Fen Montaigne he tells it very well--but it's the  story of volcanoes themselves, much more than it is the story of how he nearly got himself killed on  the side of one.<br />GRADE : B-ompetent geologists, who never leave  the lab, who could just look at the measurements that are gathered from these sites and produce equally  useful theories about what's going on.

2063114:US	52173832	R2S42NRWD4PIZZ	0847686655	481182993	The Fire of Invention: Civil Society and the Future of the Corporation	Books	4	7	8	N	N	should be read by the head of every corporation in America	Since at least the 1982 publication of his book, The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism, Michael Novak  has been the leading voice in the effort to reconcile Catholicism and capitalism, an effort which bore  spectacular fruit with the 1991 papal encyclical, Centisimus Annus.  The tension between the two  -isms, though partially a function of the fact that Capitalism is associated with Protestantism, was for  the most part a fairly natural result of capitalism's dependence on individualism and self-interest, as  opposed to Catholicism's hierarchical and authoritarian structure and Christianity's requirement of  selflessness and charity.<br />The three essays in this collection, originally delivered as the Pfizer Lectures at the American  Enterprise Institute, address the future of the corporation, intellectual property rights, and corporate  governance.  They are unified by the way in which Novak treats business and the corporation as  institutions which have important moral roles to play in society.  First he discusses the fact that  corporations are voluntary associations, which allow individuals to work together in ways that make  them more powerful and effective than they could ever be on their own and which serve important  social ends :<br />  From the point of view of civil society, the business enterprise is an important social good for four  reasons.  First, it creates jobs.  Second, it provides desirable goods and services.  Third, through its  profits, it creates wealth that did not exist before.  And fourth, it is a private social instrument,  independent of the state, for the moral and material support of other activities of civil society.<br />In fact, he argues, the effectiveness of corporations in providing goods and services, in creating  wealth, jobs, and opportunities, and in providing a counterweight to the power of central government,  makes them second in importance only to religious organizations in terms of the role they have played  in creating and guaranteeing democracy.<br />In this section he makes the really intriguing point that some of the earliest capitalist corporations  were born out of the Catholic monasteries of the Middle Ages.  He quotes the great modern Tory  historian Paul Johnson to the effect that :<br />  A great and increasing part of the arable land of Europe passed into the hands of highly disciplined  men committed to a doctrine of hard work.  They were literate.  They knew how to keep  accounts.  Above all, perhaps, they worked to a daily timetable and an accurate annual  calendar--something quite alien to the farmers and landowners they replaced.  Thus their  cultivation  of the land was organized, systematic, persistent.  And, as owners, they escaped the accidents of  deaths, minorities, administration by hapless widows, enforced sales, or transfer of ownership by  crime, treason and folly.  They brought continuity of exploitation.  They produced surpluses and  invested them in the form of drainage, clearances, livestock and seed...they determined the whole  future of Europe; they were the foundation of world primacy.<br />This is ingenious both for the insight that the great innovation that these first corporate entities offered  was continuity, of a type that was not available to individuals or even to families, and for the way in  which it implicates the Church in the creation of capitalism.  Novak's writing is characterized by this  unique combination of perceptive analysis on general issues combined with more subtle  demonstrations that capitalism and Christianity are and have been compatible.<br />The second section, on intellectual property, is so compelling that it actually made me rethink my  position on Napster.  Most of us have been tape recording albums, videotaping shows, &quot;borrowing&quot;  computer programs, and now burning cd's, for so long that we've become inured to the idea that the  underlying products are ours to exploit and that this will have little or noeffect on the artists who  create this product.  Novak draws upon Abraham Lincoln's 1850 Lecture on Discoveries and  Inventions in order to make the case that protection for patents and copyrights is one of the central  innovations of the American system, one that deserves to be defended.  He points out, for instance,  that the right of inventors and authors to receive royalties is the only &quot;right&quot; mentioned in the body of  the Constitution.  It can hardly be a coincidence that the country which affords such creative activity  the greatest protection has been the most creative nation.  Novak discusses the ways in which these  protections, which reward those who are willing to share their ideas and to take risks to develop them  into products, have served to benefit not merely the innovators themselves but the society at large, and  concludes :<br />  Patent regimes recognize the right of inventors and authors to the fruit of their own labors as a  right  in common law.  They do so because this right serves the common good by stimulating useful  inventions and creative works from which a grateful public benefits.  Far from protecting private  interests at the expense of the common good, patent protection advances the common good by  means of private interest.  The common good is the end, private interest is the means.<br />Here again, we see that although it is often blithely assumed that capitalism serves only individual  interests, it is in fact the most effective way for society in general to achieve progress.<br />In the final section, Novak discusses the various threats to the corporation presented by the various  efforts to change how they are governed.  He cites Michael Oakeshott's differentiation between the  &quot;civic association&quot; and the &quot;enterprise association&quot; :<br />  The civic association aims at something larger than any particular end, interest, or good: the  protection of a body of general rules and a whole way of life; in other words, the larger framework  within which, and only within which, the pursuit of particular ends becomes possible, peaceable,  and fruitful.  Given such a framework, individuals are free to choose myriad activities.  The state is  a civic association, he thought, or at least should be; so is the church; and so are many kinds of  clubs, charitable organizations, and associations for self-improvement.<br />  ... By contrast, Oakeshott noted, the enterprise association is built to attain quite particular  purposes... Enterprise associations are focused, purposive, instrumental, and executive: they fix a  purpose and execute it.<br />The problem that corporations (enterprise associations) now face is that politicians and political  activists are trying to blur these lines and turn them into civic institutions, with responsibilities for  meeting all kinds of political and social purposes.  This diffusion of aims, unwise as it may be, is  perhaps appropriate for government organizations : if affirmative action and the like are going to be  implemented somewhere, better that it be in government which is already moribund.  But one need  only look at the havoc such social experiments have wreaked on the military [as Stephanie Guttman  has done in her excellent book : The Kinder, Gentler Military: Can America's Gender-Neutral  Fighting Force Still Win Wars? (2000)(Stephanie Gutmann)  (Grade: B+)] in order to see the  disastrous effects of making an organization with a single purpose (being prepared to fight and win)  try to satisfy a multitude of political purposes (gender neutrality, acceptance of homosexuals, etc.).  Such fiddling by the political class has rendered our once mighty fighting forces politically correct,  but much less formidable.<br />Corporate America now finds itself prey to these same pressures.  Already overregulated on the  environmental, labor, and other fronts, business finds itself under attack for not being sufficiently  socially conscious.  They are being asked to ignore the bottom line, to eschew profits, and to instead  focus on their role in local communities.  It is supposed that society would be better off if  corporations were governed so as to &quot;benefit&quot; their employees and their neighbors, and governed in  the way that government thinks fashionable at the moment, rather than being run with mere efficiency  and profits in mind.  One would have thought that the long and disastrous European experiment with  Socialism and the spectacular failure of Japan's once vaunted economic planning would have put this  argument to rest, but, alas, such is not the case.  There will apparently always be a class of activists,  politicians, and bureaucrats who believe that they, if given the opportunity, could run the economy.  But having seen how inefficiently they run our governments, we should resist them at all costs.<br />In this book, Michael Novak is really trying to steel business people, to whom the initial lectures were  addressed, for this fight.  He seeks to warn them that they must not give up the freedom from  government interference which has made American industry so uniquely creative ann of a body of general rules and a whole way of life; in other words, the larger framework     within which, and only within which, the pursuit of particular ends becomes possible, peaceable,     and fruitful.

His--his writing--he's a much better writer than I am, a more supple  writer, and his writing leads you in different feints and the power of the writing is sometimes not  clear until you read it carefully.  -C-SPAN Booknotes with David Brooks, July 2000<br />Ever since I heard David Brooks praise his colleague so effusively on Booknotes last Summer, I've  made a particular effort to search out Andrew Ferguson's stuff in The Weekly Standard.  Brooks is  absolutely right : Ferguson's essays for the magazine are extremely sly and they conclude with a  distinctive kick, as he forcefully drives home a point you may only have been mildly aware he was  making.  An excellent example is Christianity, Clinton Style (Weekly Standard, September 11, 2000),  in which he discusses the then President's pre-Convention public confessional at Willow Creek  Community Church.  This was the event at which Clinton was supposed to apologize for the Lewinsky  mess with sufficient clarity that it would remove the subject as an issue for Mr. Gore in the fall  campaign.  In his column, Ferguson does not spare Clinton for the transparency and insincerity of the  event, but it is only as you read the last sentence that you truly realize that Clinton is only an  incidental target : Ferguson's real ire is directed at the brand of New Age Christianity which allows  itself to be used in such a manner by a clearly unrepentant serial sinner.  But when the realization  finally dawns it is all the more devastating precisely because the equation of the obviously repulsive  Clinton and the theoretically sacred Church is so surprising.<br />Fools' Names, Fools' Places is a collection of earlier pieces and it seems as if Ferguson had not quite  perfected this technique when some of them were written.  They are however very funny and they do  reflect several of the concerns which he returns to again and again in his writing : the intellectual  poverty of those New Age beliefs and the increasing divergence between celebrity and substantive  achievement in American culture.  At times these concerns fuse brilliantly as in the devastating  portrayals of Bill Moyers and Mikhail Gorbachev, both of whom have made the long strange trip  from Left Wing hatchetmen to sort of self-help gurus.  But in most of them, it is merely the  callowness and vapidity of the rich and famous that is on display.  A couple of the funniest ones are  on Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra (Sinatra at 80 : Ring-a-ding-don't).  In fact, I started laughing  so hard at a line in the Streisand profile :<br />  With her cavernous sinuses, her inexhaustible lungs, she doesn't so much sell a song as wrestle it to  the ground and kneel on its throat.  She should try this with her songwriters.<br />that my wife made me let her read the essay, right away.  After that, we kept stealing the book back  and forth from each other, the one grabbing it from the other while they were convulsed with  laughter.  (This is what passes for entertainment in your average conservative household--sharing a  collection of vituperative columns like dissidents used to pass around samiszdat in the old Soviet  Union.)  In fact, my wife got so carried away, in the midst of the essay about Peter, Paul and Mary  being arrested (Puff the Magic Dragon Goes to Jail) at an anti-apartheid demonstration, that our four  year old son ran upstairs to tell me that, &quot;Mommy isn't breathing.&quot;  I think it was this line that did it,  about how the years haven't been kind to Mary, particularly poundagewise :<br />  As she belted out the songs, she wagged her head and threw her body from side to side, while the  other celebrities struggled to anchor themselves against the assault of her weight.<br />We both enjoyed the paired essays about Ferguson appearing on a talk show as the designated  Gennifer Flowers defender andthe trouble this got him into with his wife.  What wife after all wants  her husband defending a harlot on national television ?<br />And lest you assume that all the book consists of is scurrilous right wing screeds, there are plenty of  equally acerbic glances cast at Republicans and conservatives--Newt Gingrich, Bill Bennett and David  Gergen among them.  More importantly, Ferguson is toughest on himself and his profession.  This is  the other major theme of the collection, and of much of his other writing : the pomposity of the  press.  Whether belittling himself for appearing as a talking head on cable television, or hilariously  dissecting the modern GQ/Esquire/Vanity Fair-style personality piece--the ones that all seem to start :  &quot;I met (insert name of star) for lunch at (insert name of trendy restaurant)...&quot;--the authors of which all  seem to labor under the delusion that they are themselves integral to the story, Ferguson holds up a  rather harsh light to journalism as it is practiced today.<br />In a culture which is increasingly dominated by celebrities, politicians and the press, he happily  skewers all three.  He does so in a series of essays which are as funny as any you'll ever read.  You  should definitely read the book, but in the meantime keep an eye out for his current writing.

For the most part, they center around the ongoing but largely unspoken battle  between the somewhat free-spirited husband, Jess, who likes singing and horse racing and the like, and  his more serious wife, Eliza.  The themes dealt with are mostly minor, though the difficulty of  remaining pacifist in the midst of war is treated, and, of course, became the core issue in the excellent  Gary Cooper film version of the book.<br />The real value of the book lies in its implicit rebuke to one of the central conceits of the modern age,  that simply because rather restrictive religious beliefs were central to peoples' lives in that earlier  America, their existences must necessarily have been dour and joyless.  This prejudice is silly on its  face, contrary as it is to everything we know about human nature, and Jessamyn West's stories, with  their devout, but playful, Quaker characters, are a terrific antidote.  Though the Birdwells' lives are  proscribed by rules and social conventions which may strike us as odd, they are also filled with joy  and love and a sense of community, both the physical and the spiritual community, which any one of  us would envy.<br />GRADE : B+	2001-03-19

In The Victim of Prejudice she mounts a twin attack on  the lowly status of women within society and on the exalted status of the landed gentry, who still  dominated life in that pre-industrial age.  The former attack is fairly successful, the latter is not.<br />Mary Raymond, the heroine of the novel, is orphaned at an early age, but is raised and well-educated  (perhaps too well for the time) by her guardian, Mr. Raymond.  Two brothers, sons of the Honorable  Mr. Pelham, come to Mr. Raymond's for instruction too, and Mary falls in love with William Pelham,  and he with her.  But Mary is an unacceptable match for such a wealthy youth, more unacceptable than  she realizes until Mr. Raymond reluctantly reveals the sordid circumstances of her birth, and so the  young lovers are separated.<br />Meanwhile, Sir Peter Osborne, the brutal local landowner, has taken a fancy to Mary and is reluctant  to accept her protestations of his advances.  In a symbol laden early scene, William coaxes the teenage  Mary into stealing some &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; from Osborne's vineyard.  But he catches her and expels her  from the garden, calling her &quot;a true daughter of Eve.&quot;  In the ensuing years they have several more  equally unfortunate encounters, with Osborne becoming ever more determined to have her.  Finally,  after the death of Mr. Raymond, who had tried to get her to accept a more appropriate marriage offer  to no avail, has left Mary particularly vulnerable, with no money and nowhere to go, Osborne kidnaps  and rapes her.<br />At this point William returns to the scene and finds Mary wandering, broken and ill.  Though by now  married to another, he nurses her back to health.  But when he proposes that she become his mistress,  the outraged Mary refuses and flees.  She tries to find employment several places but finds that her  reputation as a fallen woman, resulting not merely from the incident with Osborne but from her time  with the married William, follows her, causing scandal and encouraging other men to be forward with  her.<br />Throughout these various travails, she remains admirably loyal to the moral upbringing which Mr.  Raymond provided :<br />  'Let it come then!' exclaimed I with fervour; 'Let my ruin be complete! Disgrace, indigence,  contempt, while unmerited, I dare encounter, but not the censure of my own heart.  Dishonour,  death itself, is a calamity less insupportable than self-reproach.  Amidst the destruction of my  hopes, the wreck of my fortunes, of my fame, my spirit still triumphs in conscious rectitude; nor  would I, intolerable as is the sense of my wrongs and of my griefs, exchange them for all that guilty  prosperity could bestow.'<br />but is quite annoyingly passive in the face of these injustices :<br />  I revolved in my mind, selected, and rejected, as new obstacles occurred to me, a variety of plans.  Difficulties almost insuperable, difficulties peculiar to my sex, my age, and my unfortunate  situation, opposed themselves to my efforts on every side.  I sought only the bare means of  subsistence: amidst the luxuriant and the opulent, who surrounded me, I put in no claims either for  happiness, for gratification, or even for the common comforts of life: yet, surely, I had a right to  exist!<br />Somehow this ambition--mere existence-- just seems inadequate.  More appropriate, particularly as  long as her life is ruined anyway, would be to wreak a horrific vengeance on the reprehensible Lord  Peter.  But as the rather unfortunate title of the book indicates, this is a story about unrelenting  victimization.  And because Mary never really seeks to domore than exist, never even seeks redress  against Osborne, she somehow makes herself a participant in her own victimization.<br />A system which would punish the victim rather than the rapist is so obviously unjust, that the purely  feminist angle of the story does work to a degree.  However, Osborne is so awful that it is hard to  accept him as a genuinely representative figure of the British aristocracy.  Eleanor Ty, editor of the  Broadview Text edition of the book, suggests in her introduction that the character Osborne is intended  as a specific rebuke to Edmund Burke and his conservative views on the value of ancient institutions  like the aristocracy.  Though I'm a fan of Burke, there are coherent arguments to be made in  opposition to his theories : this is not one.<br />The book works well enough as a kind of Gothic thriller, and is adequate as a protofeminist tract, but  it fails as a radical polemic against the prevailing institutions of the time.

But after the Royal Air Force won the Battle of Britain, the  German invasion threat was history. If Goering's Luftwaffe could not achieve air supremacy over  the Channel, how was it going to achieve it over the Atlantic? If Hitler could not put a soldier in  England in the fall of 1940, the notion that he could invade the Western Hemisphere-with no  surface ships to engage the United States and British fleets and the U.S. airpower dominant in the  west Atlantic-was preposterous.  -Pat Buchanan (A Republic, Not an Empire)<br />  Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising  effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing.  -George Orwell<br />There it is a nutshell.  That is what all the fuss about.  Pat Buchanan has written a lively, engaging and important assessment of 200 years of American Foreign Policy.  He offers a compelling argument that we have dangerously, even disastrously, drifted away from the Founding Fathers' vision of an America free of foreign entanglements.  Relying on the entirely mainstream work of historians like Paul Kennedy, Paul Johnson and Walter McDougall (see Orrin's review of Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776 (1997)(Grade: A), he provides a clear and concise review of history, makes a pretty irrefutable case for muscular isolationism as an integral theme of American policy and offers a strong argument that nations which take on extensive foreign obligations tend to perish.  And out of all of this, all you hear people talking about is how he's somehow &quot;soft on Hitler&quot;.  What a load of bunk.<br />I've addressed that canard before (see Letter to the Editor).  I think it's fairly obvious to any impartial observer that Buchanan is right on at least this point, Nazi Germany was no threat to the United States in 1941.  Whether we, and the world, would have been better served by simply stepping aside and allowing Hitler and Stalin to slug it out, is a more difficult question to answer definitively.  But looking back on the wreckage left over from the Soviet Union and the Cold War, it's hard to see how things could have actually been worse had we done so.<br />But the hysteria over this issue has allowed Pat to skate on several other points where he seems to me to be more clearly in the wrong.  First, while it is understandable given the administrations he served, he is guilty of not rigorously applying the logic of his own argument to the Cold War.  If he were to be scrupulously honest, he would have to call into question the entire policy of containment and the forty year American confrontation with the Soviet Union.  This policy will, like America's entry into WWII, never be dealt with in a clear eyed manner, because the West eventually &quot;won&quot; the Cold War.  But it behooves the reader to consider whether bankrupting the nation, tearing ourselves apart over Korea, Vietnam, Central America, etc. and creating a massive Security State was truly worthwhile in light of the fact that we allowed most of the globe to fester under communist tyranny for that entire period.<br />In the first instance, we have to regard the decision to stop the war in Europe with the Communists still in power in Russia as an incontrovertible disaster.  Second, we have to consider whether we did not have some moral obligation to take the Cold War hot and juke it out with the USSR.  Third, we should at least contemplate the possibility that the USSR would have fallen as quickly, or even more quickly, had we simply ignored them.  Not only was much of their oppression legitimized by the argument that they  faced a hostile West, it is also likely that had they been allowed to overrun more of their neighbors they would have become even more overextended and the centrifugal forces that contributed to their demise would have been greatly exacerbated.  If, as I believe, the criticism of American engagement in WWII is legitimate, then the same criticism, or at least a critical eye, should be turned on American engagement in the Cold War.  Buchanan's failure to engage in this exercise unnecessarily weakens his overall argument about the pedigree and success of U.S. isolationism.<br />More centrally, Buchanan's essential thesis, that we have incurred too many obligations in the world, obligations which we would be irresponsible to fulfill, while it is absolutely correct, has been rendered a nullity by the march of budgetary politics.  The present budget surplus--despite Clintonian and Republican rhetoric about hard decisions, revolutions, and fiscal responsibility--is exclusively a product of the gutting of the Defense Budget.  We now spend less ( in adjusted dollars, percentage of the budget and percentage of GDP) on the military than we did in the years leading up to World War II and, as a result, we once again have a hollow army.  There is no way on God's Green Earth that we could ever meet any of the treaty obligations that rightly concern Pat, unless we resorted to nuclear weapons (the prospect of rapid resort to nukes does not particularly bother me, but one assumes that most critics of this book would be troubled, if not horrified, by the prospect).<br />We no longer have the manpower, nor the materiel, nor the willingness to pay for the type of military excursion that he fears we will be sucked into.  (Recall that even in the relatively minor Gulf War we made other nations foot the bill.)  Sure we can stop China from taking Taiwan, but that is more a function of the difficulty of the task.  We might even stop North Korea from taking South Korea, because some Americans would be killed in the North's invasion.  But let Russia decide to pummel Chechnya and we stand around like the paper tiger that we have become and mouth hoary platitudes while the attacks continue.  Does anyone honestly think that we would saddle up and ride to the rescue of Lithuania in like circumstances?  Be real.  The forces of isolation that are tightly interwoven in the American psyche have been hard at work for a decade now and have already answered many of Pat's concerns.  Regardless of the high-flown phrases of the Clintonistas, the fact remains, Bill Clinton, Strobe Talbott, Madeline Albright, et al, preside over an America which is incapable, because it is unwilling, of backing up the promises that we have made.  In battling against the prospect of American military intervention abroad, Buchanan is, by and large, attacking a straw man.  National pride and American trustworthiness will be the casualties, not American boys, should a bill come due for one of our myriad alliances.<br />There is one other thing that is being ignored in the mad rush to condemn Pat and brand him an extremist kook.  The press, the critics and the pundits are overlooking the fact that Pat is providing exactly what they always claim to want, a campaign of ideas.  Regardless of whether you agree with any or all of what he says, I think you have to acknowledge that he has elevated the intellectual content of this campaign, indeed he appears to have raised it beyond the capacity of the talking heads to understand his thesis, and started an important national dialogue over America's proper role in the world.  After the recent Presidential contests that devolved into cat fights over things like flag burning, Sister Souljah, Willie Horton, and the like, it is refreshing to see candidates actually discussing more profound issues like WWII, entangling alliances, free trade, etc.  But, typically, the nattering class is so repelled by his ideas that they refuse to even acknowledge that he is trying something exceedingly rare in the history of the Republic; he's actually running on a unified and coherent ideology.<br />In fact, there have only been two other major candidates this century who presented such a clearly ideologically based message to the voters--Goldwater and Reagan.  Significantly, both of them were likewise treated as kooks by the mainstream intelligentsia.  Goldwater of course got trounced, but Reagan, running on virtually the same platform 16 years later, won in a landslide and changed the political landscape for a generation. Now Pat is running a campaign which embraces not merely any old ideas, but themes that have proven extraordinarily resilient throughout our nation's history.  His arguments can be dismissed by the nabobs, if they don't honestly engage the issues he raises, but they do so at significant risk to their own hegemony.  This election may not be the one that returns us to an openly stated posture of isolationism, but that is clearly where we are headed and, more than likely, where most of us hope to arrive.<br />This is an extremely entertaining book, written with Buchanan's trademark polemical style (a style developed in the Nixon White House and honed by twenty years of McLauould be killed in the North's invasion.

We may as well, as there has hardly been a critic who has not  referred to The Roots of Heaven as a symbolic novel.  I can only state firmly and rather hopelessly  that it is nothing of the sort.  It has been said that my elephants are really symbols of freedom, of  African independence.  Or that they are the last individuals threatened with extinction in our  collective, mechanized, totalitarian society.  Or that these almost mythical beasts evoke in this  atheistical age an infinitely bigger and more powerful Presence.  Or, then again, that they are an  allegory of mankind itself menaced with nuclear extinction.  There is almost no limit to what you  can make an elephant stand for, but if the image of this lovable pachyderm thus becomes for each of  us a sort of Rorschach test--which was exactly my intention--this does not make him in the least  symbolic.  It only goes to prove that each of us carries in his soul and mind a different notion of  what is essential to our survival, a different longing and a personal interpretation, in the largest  sense, of what life preservation is about.  -Romain Gary, Author's Introduction to the 1964 Time-Life Books version of The Roots of Heaven<br />It is one of the peculiarities of great literature, that having created it, the author sometimes loses control of it.  Thus, Don Quijote, the first and greatest novel of Western Literature, may have been intended by Cervantes to be a devastating parody of the chivalric tales, but instead of making us scoff at the Don's antiquated ideas, the book gave us the quintessential romantic idealist hero.  Similarly, when he wrote his Prix Goncourt winning book The Roots of Heaven, Romain Gary may have thought that he had crafted a novel of immense ambiguity, but readers have had little trouble finding in this tale of the French dentist Morel and his mad quest to save the elephants of Africa, a fairly straightforward metaphor for the struggle to preserve freedom.<br />Morel has come to a French Equatorial Africa which, in the wake of WWII, is percolating with unrest as the natives begin to agitate for independence.  Meanwhile, the European settlers who developed the territory wish to hold on to what they've created.  Added to the mix are various and sundry missionaries, anthropologists, prostitutes, traders, hunters, army deserters, and the like, who have all washed up in the colony.<br />Morel starts out by trying to get folks to sign a petition in favor of the elephants, but when he is met with scorn and indifference, he takes matters into his own hands and begins a campaign of low-grade (non-lethal) terrorism against those who hunt the animals.  He quickly becomes the most wanted man in the colony, and then a legendary figure to the whole world.  He is a hero to many, a traitorous and dangerous figure to the authorities, and a convenient opportunity to the rebels.  People, with widely varying motives, including fomenting revolution, begin to join his crusade.  At one point, when he is still petitioning, he explains to the local barmaid/prostitute, Minna, how he came to champion the elephant :<br />  I first began thinking about the elephants during the war, when I was a prisoner in Germany,  probably because they were the most different thing I could imagine from what surrounded me :  they were the very image of immense liberty.  Every time we looked at the barbed wire or were  almost dying of misery and claustrophobia in solitary confinement, we tried to think of those big  animals marching irresistibly through the open spaces of Africa, and it made us feel better.  Barely  alive, starved, exhausted, we would clench our teeth and follow our great free herds obstinately with  our eyes, and see them march across the savanna and over the hills, and we could almost hear the  earth tremble under that living mass of freedom.  We tried not to speak of it, for fear the guards  would notice, and sometimes we would justlook at each other and wink, and then we knew that it  was all right, that we could still see it, that it was still alive in us.  We held on to the image of that  gigantic liberty, and somehow it helped us to survive.<br />So regardless of Gary's supposed intent, Morel's own words, here and throughout the book, would seem to indicate that he himself sees the elephants as symbol's of freedom.<br />It would have been easy enough for Gary to simply turn Morel into an unalloyed hero, a classic freedom fighter, but he does not.  Gary refers to Morel as an extremist of hope, and the emphasis is equally placed on the extremism.  A Jesuit priest in the novel, loosely modeled on Tielhard de Chardin, quite accurately indicts Morel for elevating the idea of the elephants above even his fellow man.  I think it's the priest who points out that Morel has chosen to place his hopes in the elephants because they are without sin, and the inability to accept Man's nature which this choice reflects is at heart anti-human.  In addition, Gary does not simply demonize those who oppose Morel; many of them are just as idealistic as he.  One of the best set speeches in the book comes from one of the colonists, whose elephant hunting wife Morel has just sentenced to a public flogging :<br />  I know the tune.  The elephants, you say.  But it's only Europeans who have hunting weapons and  who can afford permits, and what you mean is that we are the only people who are exploiting and  exhausting Africa's natural wealth.  That's a tune I've heard ever since I've been here, but the truth is  that Africa's wealth isn't exploited enough, and that without us it wouldn't be exploited at all, and its  very existence would be unknown.  Without us, the so-called 'colonists'--and I'm not ashamed of that  name--not a single vein of ore would be discovered, and the population wouldn't have doubled in  twenty years.  When I arrived here I found only syphilis, leprosy and sleeping sickness : I cured my  people, fed them, clothed them, gave them work, houses and ambition--the desire to do what we do.  It's men like me who have been, and still are, the leaven of Africa.  You and your lot call that  'shameless exploitation of Africa's natural wealth'; I call it building up a new Africa for all, and first  of all for the Africans.  But because ivory was the first thing we were after when we came here at  the turn of the century and because we're the only ones to hunt with modern weapons, you've  thought it smart to make elephant hunting the symbol of capitalist exploitation.<br />Now this assessment of Morel's motives is quite wrong, but it's important for a couple of reasons.  First, it presents a legitimate defense of the colonists.  Second, the very misunderstanding reflects the reason why, even though Morel is generally a sympathetic figure, the Europeans may be right to resist him, because even though his motives may be pure, others can warp them to their own ends.<br />One of the characters explains the title of the book this way :<br />  Our needs--for justice, for freedom and dignity--are roots of heaven that are deeply imbedded in  our hearts, but of heaven itself men know nothing but the gripping roots...<br />The ferocity with which Morel clings to this sentiment and the absurd grandeur of his fight make him one of the more unforgettable heroes in all of literature and one whom it's odd to find in a French novel.  Then again, as another charcter says of him :<br />  I believe Morel was defending a certain idea of decency--the way we are treated on this earth filled  him with indignation.  At bottom, he was an Englishman without knowing it.<br />The book is not currently in print and it's not easy to find, but it's well worth the effort.<br />GRADE : A+tried not to speak of it, for fear the guards      would notice, and sometimes we would just look at each other and wink, and then we knew that it      was all right, that we could still see it, that it was still alive in us.

There are certainly no other characters who are so familiar, so often revived in plays, movies, song, television, and books, nor so often parodied and imitated as they.  Take a look at your TV Guide and there'll be a movie featuring at least one of the four on the air at some point this week.  They are all still just as popular as the day their authors introduced them.  The reason for this is, first of all that they are simply brilliant creations, but secondly that they each in their own way tap into very powerful human fears and aspirations.  Frankenstein's monster and Dracula represent victory over mortality.  Tarzan represents victory over Nature.  Sherlock Holmes represents the ultimate and inevitable triumph of reason over the mysteries of human behavior.<br />Of this quartet, it is Holmes, because he is the most realistic character and because his victory seems closest to our grasp, who resonates most deeply with us.  Realistically, none of us expect to gain eternal life nor to be plopped down in the jungle unexpectedly, but there's a sense in Holmes that, for all his genius, he is really just using the brain power that all of us share better than the rest of us do.  As he tells Watson here, after one of his those classic moments where the good Doctor is stunned by one of Holmes's analyses :<br />  The world is full of obvious things, which nobody by any chance ever observes.<br />Nobody that is except the world's greatest detective.  But the idea that things are just waiting to be observed, and the simplicity of Holmes observations, serves to foster the illusion that the mysterious will yield to our intellect should we merely apply rigorous reason.  For all his foibles and quirks, it is this that makes Sherlock Holmes an aspirational figure.<br />Holmes and Watson are so familiar to us as to need no further exposition.  Suffice it to say that this quintessential novel features many of the elements that made the series immortal : inexplicable doings at stately manor houses, chases across the moors, pea soup fogs, beautiful damsels in distress, and the like.  And if the villain is not the equal of Dr. Moriarity (then again, who is ?), surely this tantalizing intoduction to the mystery is as enticing as any ever committed to paper :<br />  &quot;On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler who made the  discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was  sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the  event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at  the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at  the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in  the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other  footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I  carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my  arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the  ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an  extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. TheFe was certainly  no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was made by  Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the  ground round the body. He did not observe any.

2069168:US	52173832	R29MY6DNP9INJE	0895267659	577485728	Ghosts on the Roof: Selected Journalism of Whittaker Chambers, 1931-1959	Books	5	90	91	N	N	witnessing	For forty years the accepted establishment view of Whittaker Chambers was that of a fat, rumpled weirdo, obsessed, presumably for some kind of degenerate sexual reasons, with the destruction of Alger Hiss, a man who was in every way his better.  Even the publication and excellent sales of his extraordinary memoir, Witness, could not erase that caricature from the minds of the elites.  I remember a PBS miniseries about the Hiss case, which must date from the late 70's or early 80's (I checked; it looks like it was, fittingly, broadcast in 1984), which portrayed Hiss as a victim, if not an outright innocent.  But then the pendulum began to swing :<br />  -First came the 1978 publication of Allen Weinstein's authoritative book, Perjury : The  Hiss-Chambers Case, which convinced most of the holdouts of the guilt of Alger Hiss.<br />  -Then, in 1984, Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Chambers the Presidential Medal of Freedom.<br />  -Five years later came this collection of the journalism of Whittaker Chambers, Ghosts on the Roof,  which began the process of restoring his literary reputation.<br />  -The fall of the Soviet Union unleashed a flood of government secrets from both US and Russian  files which exposed both the extent and success of Soviet efforts to penetrate the US government,  media and Hollywood in the 30's &amp; 40's and peace groups in the subsequent decades.<br />  -In 1995, the VENONA intercepts were revealed, with their decoded messages confirming that the  Rosenbergs and Hiss, among others, had been Soviet agents.<br />  -Finally, the publication in 1997 of the first serious biography, Whittaker Chambers : A Biography  by Sam Tanenhaus, and the truly bizarre moment on Meet the Press when Clinton CIA nominee  Tony Lake could not bring himself to declare Alger Hiss guilty, even fifty years after the fact,  forced a major re-examination of Chambers, his legacy, and the legacy of those who were simply  unable to accept his charges no matter the evidence (like Lake and like CNN in their Cold War  series).<br />After all of that, it is perhaps now possible to contemplate Chambers the writer in a somewhat more neutral, less partisan, light.  This collection includes everything from political essays to reflections on the Hiss case to movie and book reviews to a set of historical essays on Western Culture written for LIFE.  Among the best pieces are a review of Finnegans Wake and a tribute to Joyce on his death; a review of the movie version of Grapes of Wrath, which Henry Luce said was the best film review ever published in TIME; a really scathing review of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged; and the prophetic title essay.<br />...<br />The outstanding piece though may well be the one that Teachout chose for the title.  Ghosts on the Roof ran in TIME on March 5, 1945, shortly after the Yalta Conference, when the Allies were still basking in the glow of having cooperated to defeat Hitler.  With admirable foresight, Chambers pricked this gonfalon bubble.  The essay fantasizes that the ghosts of Nicholas and Alexandra and the other murdered Romanovs descend upon the roof of the Livadia Palace at Yalta to watch the goings-on.  There they meet Clio, the Muse of History, who has likewise come to observe the Big Three Conference.  When History expresses her surprise at finding the Romanovs there, they reveal that they have become fans of Stalin and have converted to Marxism, actually Stalinism.  The Tsar and Tsarina explain that Stalin is achieving conquests which even Peter the Great never dared and now come Britain and America as virtual supplicants, unwittingly giving him the opportunity to grab more land in the East in exchange for entering the war with Japan.  They share the Marxist belief that in the years following the war, England and the U.S. will collapse because of the internal contradictions of capitalism.  Clio tells them that this will not happen, that the years to come will see a conflict between two opposing faiths,leading to &quot;more wars, more revolutions, greater proscriptions, bloodshed and human misery.&quot;  The Tsarina asks why she does not intervene to avert this, and Clio answers that humans never learn from History and :<br />  Besides, I must leave something for my sister, Melpomene to work on.<br />Melpomene, Clio's sister, is the Muse of Tragedy.  Here, years before he became embroiled in the Hiss case, long before the Cold War started, before the Atomic Age had even dawned, is Whittaker Chambers warning the West of the future it faces and forecasting it uncannily.<br />These essays, and the many others included here, make for really interesting reading.  They reveal Chambers to be both a gifted and a prescient writer.  His opinions on the Arts stand up extremely well.  His assessments of political situations were as much forty years ahead of their time; particularly perceptive in this regard is one (&quot;Soviet Strategy in the Middle East&quot; [National Review October 26, 1957]) in which he predicted how the Soviets would foster Arab radicalism in the Middle East.  All in all, the book serves to add depth and heft to a man who spent almost half a century as a caricature, who was more an undeserving victim of Anti-Anti-Communism than any of those who were blacklisted were &quot;victims&quot; of Anti-Communism.  It is altogether fitting that the 20th Century, which Chambers did so much to redeem, ended with his reputation ascendant and those of his opponents in rapid decline.<br />GRADE : Ars to come will see a conflict between two opposing faiths, leading to &quot;more wars, more revolutions, greater proscriptions, bloodshed and human misery.&quot;  The Tsarina asks why she does not intervene to avert this, and Clio answers that humans never learn from History and : <br />    Besides, I must leave something for my sister, Melpomene to work on. <br />Melpomene, Clio's sister, is the Muse of Tragedy.

Buckley, Jr., (National Review, 1955, First Issue)<br />Ronald Reagan recently turned 90 (2/06/01) and the outpouring of praise from nearly every pundit and politician was downright stunning, even coming, as it did, in the midst of Bill Clinton's typically disgraceful departure from a sordid presidency.  Granted, the encomiums from even his ideological enemies must have been attributable in part to just Reagan's personal character, which benefits so greatly by comparison to Bill Clinton's, but not entirely.  Some of the praise of his opponents, and most of the hosannas from his supporters, were for the ideas that Reagan represented, and which still dominate our politics today.<br />To see how colossal a figure Reagan remains on the political landscape, we need only look at what George W. Bush is proposing to do as president in the first years of the 21st Century :  cut taxes, build Star Wars, balance the budget, privatize Social Security and education, limit abortion, allow religious groups to deliver social services, and restore dignity to the Oval Office.  Thirty six years after his first major national speech (for Goldwater in 1964), and twenty four years after his first all out bid for the presidency (against President Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican primaries), the national dialogue today is squarely centered on the ideas that Ronald Reagan introduced or advocated.  The only major elements that are missing are winning the Cold War, which he already won for us, and Welfare reform, which was enacted by the GOP class of '94 (his ideological children).  And what of the Party that he led ?  Ronald Reagan, it must be remembered, ran in the aftermath of Watergate, when the badly battered Republicans were a semi-permanent minority in Congress and on the state level.  Now the party controls both houses of Congress, and has for four consecutive elections, completely dominates the governorships and has achieved parity with Democrats in controlling state legislatures.  Regardless of what you think of him personally, or of his politics, the United States today is very much Ronald Reagan's America, and to a remarkable degree, we live in a world that he, nearly alone, envisioned.  The question for historians is why ?<br />...<br />The strengths of the book then, and they are considerable, lie in D'Souza's generous reassessment of the Reagan legacy, particularly coming, as it did, before the current lovefest with Reagan began.  The weakness, and it too is significant, lies in his failure to adopt the Reagan model in writing the book.  If D'Souza had structured the book around the larger theme of Reagan's emphasis on freedom, and then stooped to answer specific criticisms only in this context, it would have helped greatly, would have given it a unity that it sadly lacks.  The book is instead a defense of Ronald Reagan as Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton might have written it, absorbed by tiny matters to the detriment of great ones.  Ronald Reagan deserves, and hopefully will one day get, a biographer who is himself Reaganesque, who understands that it was the restoration of freedom that mattered, and that everything else--Iran Contra, tax hikes, budget deficits, etc.--important as each controversy may have appeared for a time, was just background noise.  But that book, unfortunately, remains to be written.<br />GRADE : B-controls both houses of Congress, and has for four consecutive elections, completely dominates the governorships and has achieved parity with Democrats in controlling state legislatures.

When her work in Silicon Valley brought her into contact with Wade Randlett, a manic Democratic fund raiser and self described passionate centrist, who had decided to make it his mission to bring together the New Democrats with the entrepreneurs of the New Economy, she recognized the makings of a good story.<br />  I saw Wade Randlett as the guy who could be the pivot point for the major political realignment  that was under way in the Democratic Party.  He wasn't the most important figure in politics or  high tech by any means, but he occupied an incredibly interesting position bridging the two.  What  Randlett represented was nothing as predictable as a political organization or a business entity; he  articulated a political sensibility that was new, as yet uninstitutionalized, and utterly of the  moment.  His intelligence, his shrewdness, and his unfettered ambition made him someone well  worth following.  If the Democrats were going to be able to claim high tech as their own, and if  Silicon Valley was going to choose the Democrats to represent its interests, I was sure Randlett  would be there at the center of things.  If I kept track of him, I thought, I'd be able to watch the  connection happen.<br />Beginning in 1996 she followed Randlett as he embarked on his patently absurd quest, working through two successive trade associations--the California Technology Alliance and TechNet--to purchase Democratic loyalty with high tech money, and she put her access to good effect in this insider's account of the doomed courtship.<br />Why absurd ?  Why doomed ?  Well, Randlett's, and the author's. basic premise was that the election of Bill Clinton represented a genuine shift to the center by the Democratic Party, which with a little encouragement, mostly financial, might become the official party of the High Tech economy and, thereby, dominate American politics for a generation, in the same way that it had after FDR and the New Deal.  They believed that :<br />  The New Democrats who triumphed with Clinton in 1992 were a perfect match for entrepreneurs  whose bedrock conviction was that the rules of the market guided all human endeavor.  Silicon  Valley businessmen acted as if they believed that money was the universal and only accurate  standard of measurement in the world.  They seemed to think that the question Does it maximize  shareholder value ? meant the same thing as Is it morally right?  Efficiency, in their world, had  become worth; wealth was proof of rightness.  And so the industry whose most influential  spokesmen insisted that ideology was dead met the party whose President had no apparent ideology,  a party that took their money and hailed them as the future.<br />  Clinton's election in 1992 confirmed the DLC's [Democratic Leadership Council's] belief that its  New Democratic politics were gaining ground--and that it was attracting a &quot;core&quot; of business  support.<br />Some of their confusion, as expressed above, is understandable given the unique circumstances of the Clinton presidency, but the rest is a product of simple historical ignorance.<br />Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and subsequent election in 1992 were sufficiently remarkable that folks can be forgiven for misunderstanding them.  After all, conventional wisdom by the late 1980's had determined that the Democrats were the institutional party of Congress, and that Republicans had a hammerlock on the Presidency.  When Bill Clinton, a former head of the DLC, positioned himself as a New Democrat, ran against most of the Party's traditional constituencies, and actually won, it was possible to interpret his victory as a triumph for a new brand of Democratic politics, more conservative on social issues, especially crime, though still relatively pro-abortion, and more favorable to business and economic growththan the Party had been in the past.<br />Despite a lackluster or even incompetent cabinet overall (think Ron Brown, Henry Cisneros, Janet Reno, Donna Shalala, Mike Espy, Les Aspin, Warren Christopher, etc.), he did surround himself with the most conservative group of economic advisors of any Democratic president : Lloyd Bentsen, the old Al Gore, Alice Rivlin, Robert Rubin, and Leon Panetta.  In addition, he paid obeisance to Alan Greenspan, even though tight-money Federal Reserve chairmen have been historic whipping boys of the Democratic Party.  Together, this group pushed him towards the right on spending issues and encouraged him to sign the two Reagan era free trade bills, NAFTA and GATT, which finally made it to fruition on his watch.  Outwardly at least, one could argue that the potential existed then for a paradigm shift, with the Democrats, already closer to libertarianism than Republicans on social issues, now co-opting the GOP's more libertarian pro-business positions.  This &quot;new&quot; politics of the Democrats might have been particular attractive to Silicon Valley's whiz kids, who tended towards a kind of libertarianism, which made them uncomfortable with the Republican Party's anti-abortion, anti-gay policies.  The problem is that it was never a realistic platform for the Democrats to adopt, as soon became obvious.<br />Things began to unravel with the Health Care debacle.  David Gergen argues, I think convincingly, that when the original Troopergate story broke Clinton was forced to yield control over Health Care to Hilary as a price for his infidelity.  She steered the plan in the direction of old style Democratic politics and left him in the position of defending policies that ran counter to everything else he was trying to do.  Republicans then draped the plan around his neck and, even more unbelievably than his winning the presidency, took over both houses of Congress for the first time in forty years.  the ranks of moderate Democrats were decimated because they came from swing districts which Republicans had carried.  What remained of the Democrats was a rump party of the unreconstructed hard left, which Clinton wisely distanced himself from, at the behest of Dick Morris.  This did suffice to win him another term, using Morris's strategy of triangulation to portray himself as the only man who could hold back the worst excesses of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats.<br />Then came impeachment and the effective death of even Clinton as a &quot;New Democrat.&quot;  With only the Democrats in the House and political activists on television to defend him, Clinton was forced to curry favor with the Left wing (by then the only wing) of the Party.  Once arguably moderate, he became an enemy of tax cuts, deregulation, school vouchers, partial privatization of Social Security, and other proposals of the Republican Party, most of which had been supported in a general way by New Democrats like Joe Lieberman.  The Left saved his hide and he paid them back by accepting their agenda unquestioningly.<br />Any remaining illusions that the New Democrat ideology had a future in the Party were obliterated as first Al Gore and then Lieberman jettisoned every single moderate position they had ever held in order to hew as closely as possible to old Democrat positions.  Al Gore's speech to the Democratic convention in 2000 was a virtual eulogy for moderate politics.<br />At first blush, it may appear that Randlett's original premise had some merit, but that unique events caught up to it; however, the truth is that the premise was false from the beginning.  This is obvious by simple reference to the issues that Miles talks about throughout the book as being those which most concerned the folks in Silicon Valley.  These issues include : low taxes, education reform, freedom from regulation, anti-union policies, protection from shareholder suits, H1-B visas for high tech workers from other nations, the right to hirethe most qualified people for jobs, etc.  In essence, they wanted the Democrats to help them defeat : unions, teachers, consumer groups, environmentalists, trial lawyers, and civil rights activists.  Those groups are, of course, along with feminist/pro-abortion groups, the core constituencies of the Democratic party.  It is patently ridiculous to think that under any circumstances the Party was going to take these groups on; the fact that Bill Clinton got himself in so much personal trouble that he was completely dependent on them for his survival only hastened an inevitable date with political reality.<br />In fact, there's already a group which represents the ideals that the DLC and other New Democrats were talking about in the mid-90's, the Republican Party.

Stein wrote the Ethics column at Esquire for many years and, inevitably for someone addressing ethical concerns, had periodically stumbled into conservative positions, but as late as 1992 he volunteered for the Clinton campaign.  The real turning point in his life came when his wife had their first child and announced, to his initial shock, that she would be staying home from now on to raise the baby.  Nothing in the book is more revealing than the reaction of friends and colleagues to her decision.  They were almost uniformly flabbergasted at, some were even hostile to, the idea that she might give up her career to be a full time mother.  As is so often the case, when forced to examine political questions through the prism of parenthood, Stein too found his own views becoming increasingly conservative:<br />  ...something odd began to happen--mainly to the country, and incidentally to people like me.  As  feminism and multiculturalism more and more sought to remake society, attacking much that had  served  humanity well as narrow or even antique, we concluded we could no longer in good  conscience remain on that side.  There was both too little respect for the accumulated wisdom of the  ages and too much playing havoc with truth and common sense.  Indeed, many of us were soon  startled to find ourselves tagged conservatives (and often worse) for holding firm to the  old-fashioned liberalism: a bedrock commitment to fairness and individual liberty.<br />These nascent flickers of rightward leanings were soon fanned into a genuine conservative flame by both the spectacle of the Clinton Administration and, even more so, by the frequently vicious reaction that his rather mild apostasy provoked at the workplace, in his social circle, and from readers.  He was brought face to face with one of the ugliest aspects of modern liberalism, the intolerance for dissenting opinion and the willingness to demonize anyone who strays from liberal orthodoxy.  By the time of the impeachment scandal, Stein realized that he was no longer a liberal Democrat he had become a Republican, albeit a pretty moderate one.<br />Alongside the account of his political trek, Stein launches into short polemical riffs on issues like  abortion, affirmative action, religious freedom, gay rights and so on.  To anyone who follows Republican politics and the Conservative Movement, most of this will be familiar, perhaps too familiar, but Stein does bring the zeal of a convert and it's always fun to watch the scales fall from someone's eyes.  The best stuff in these sections is his personal experience with political correctness, which adds immediacy to his tale, and a seminal theory on why the French love Jerry Lewis.<br />My one quibble with the book is the same as I had for William Henry's fairly similar In Defense of Elitism.  Lingering pangs of liberal guilt lead Stein to attack certain easy targets on the Right, even though it's not terribly clear how he differs with them, and given his own evolving views it's really hard to see how the attacks make much sense.  For example, though he remains relatively pro choice, he does say that he believes that the fetus is a living being.  In the next breath though he attacks pro-life absolutists as unreasonable.  My own views on abortion are not dissimilar to Stein's, but having conceded that abortion takes a life, I don't see how I can then turn around and say that those who oppose all abortions are being extremists.  Their views are actually consistent, it is mine which are morally flaccid.  I'm the one who supports taking a position for reasons of social expedience; who then am I to pretend to be morally superior to those who simply extend my own views to their logical ends?  Of course it's still early days for Stein and as he gets acclimated over here on the Right one assumes he'll lose the psychological need to curry favor with former fellow travelers by dissing his new comrades.<br />At any rate, it's an immensely enjoyable book, one that I recommend heartily.

Like all of Woodward's books, this one excels at giving the reader a rare inside look at the making of policy.  what will come as a shock to most people, particularly to readers of William Greider's book Secrets of the Temple, is how fundamentally chaotic that process really is.  Greider and most Fed critics contend that the Federal Reserve is an all powerful, unaccountable institution which manipulates the economy in order to serve the interests of banks and bond holders (i.e., the rich) at the expense of borrowers (i.e. , the middle class).  Greenspan and his fellow Fed members do certainly emerge as zealous guardians against inflation--particularly the Chairman himself who is from the generation of leaders who quite helplessly fought against the explosive post-Vietnam inflation of the 1970s--but throughout the book they are fighting a monster who stubbornly refuses to rear his ugly head.<br />Much of modern economics is based around the near religious belief in the concept of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), which essentially holds that there is a limit below which unemployment can not fall without triggering inflation rises.  The reasons for this are fairly self-evident; at some point the competition between employers for new workers must put pressure on wages.  However, during this prolonged expansion unemployment has been driven far below the accepted NAIRU, once thought to be over 6%, and has stayed low without setting off the predicted inflationary effects.  Of course, it might be possible to temporarily hide increases in labor costs, if companies ate into their own profit margins, but profits have grown during this period also.  This is theoretically impossible and neither Greenspan, nor any of his peers, could figure out what was happening.  Finally, and I mean finally, after a period of years, Greenspan determined that their statistics were undermeasuring enormous productivity increases, driven by technology, which were alleviating inflation pressure.<br />Meanwhile, there were several other phenomena which they either never comprehended or Woodward didn't, but which seem readily amenable to at least partial explanation.  Three of the tasks that Greenspan and the Fed pursued over this period were to return the Federal government to balanced budgets, to tamp down the skyrocketing stock market, and to slow the rapid growth of the US economy.  They failed utterly at all three : why ?<br />The Budget<br />Many would protest that they succeeded here, but a government that is running an $800 billion surplus, as ours is projected to do soon, is being mismanaged just as badly as one which is running enormous deficits.  What happened here ?<br />The simple fact is that Greenspan and the rest of the green eyeshade crew got so caught up in the microeconomics of budget numbers that they failed to look at the changing global landscape.  It is obviously the case that America ended the Cold War running large deficits and they were exacerbated by the inevitable industrial restructuring as the economy changed from a wartime to a peacetime posture.  But the other obvious fact, obvious at the time had anyone cared to think about it, was that there was about to be a titanic peace dividend.  First, defense spending has plunged, to the point where  we now budget roughly the same percentage of money for defense as we did prior to Pearl Harbor.  By itself, this savings would probably have resulted in balanced budgets.  Second, America had basically been pursuing a &quot;guns &amp; butter&quot; policy since the time of JFK. In exchange for the public's acquiescence in Cold War adventurism, the government had vastly expanded domestic spending,  Additionally, wartime imperatives had given labor a whiphand, allowing them to push for ever higher wages as a cost of producing the weaponry with which to confront the Soviets.  The end of the Cold War made it possible to confront the public and labor, with the result that domestic spending and industrial wages both stopped increasing at their prior rates.  Finally, the defeat of the Soviets freed something like a quarter of the world's population from communism and turned them into consumers, hungry for our goods.  The $500 billion deficit package that Bill Clinton and the Democrats passed in 1993, and George Bush's earlier package, pale in comparison to these enormous structural changes in the US and world economies.  If anything, it is likely that the deficit plans acted as an unnecessary brake on US postwar economic growth and delayed the point at which the budget went into balance.<br />The Market Boom<br />This is still just a theory and I suppose it will eventually be put to the test (perhaps in the NASDAQ over the coming year), but I wonder whether 401k's haven't made it nearly impossible to drive down stock prices for an extended period.  Over 70 million Americans now own stocks in some form, presumably mostly through 401k plans.  Total investment in 401k's is over $1 Trillion and more goes in every two weeks.  Every paycheck Americans pump money into the market.  Sure, at times, like this past January, they tend to sit on the sidelines by putting it mostly in money markets, but they (we) are just waiting for an opportune moment to pump it into stocks.  The latest slide in the NASDAQ happens to have coincided with a slowdown in overall economic growth, but let the tax cuts pass or the Fed start cutting rates, and the transfer of money from those funds into the market will get those prices headed back up again.  And even during this stretch of relatively bad news, the Dow has stayed well over 10,000.  It appears at least a possibility that 401k's, with the thirty or forty year perspective that they necessarily force upon investors, have created a broadbased multitude of stockholders and buyers who are less susceptible to normal fluctuations in the market and who will not be easily influenced by the Fed's attempts to dampen enthusiasm.<br />Rapid Growth<br />This is actually a hidden, but unnecessary, victory for the Fed.  The combination of artificially high interest rates and the aforementioned debt reduction packages have created an environment where the American people are extremely overtaxed and borrowing costs are much too high.  This has slowed the economy, but the countervailing factors are so overwhelming positive that it has still experienced robust growth.<br />Overtaxation is readily apparent from the surpluses we are running and which will skyrocket in coming years.  Interest rates are a little more subtle, but not much.  What is the one thing that we were always told about why we had to reduce the deficit ?  That reducing government competition for loan money would free up more for private borrowers and result in lower rates.

Inspired by the example of Alan Lomax, who recorded old  blues singers down South in the 1930's, and motivated by the recent death of Ty Cobb, Lawrence S.  Ritter, an economist and New York University professor by trade, spent several years (1961-66)  tracking down and interviewing old ballplayers, recording their memories of the game for posterity  before they too passed away.  The book presents these sessions as extended monologues, alternately  amusing, proud, defensive, and wistful recollections of their own careers, of the times they played in,  and of the characters they knew.<br />But now, as if the book weren't enough, the tape recordings of the actual interviews are available in  audiobook form.  Each is introduced by Ritter, who came to know many of the players quite well.  And in his introduction, Ritter reveals that it was only years after the project that it occurred to him  that one of the things driving him was the death of his own father.  Recapturing the memories of the  players his father had loved served as a final filial connection.<br />The interviews include those with : &quot;Wahoo&quot; Sam Crawford, &quot;Rube&quot; Marquard, &quot;Chief&quot; Meyers, Hans  Lobert, &quot;Smokey&quot; Joe Wood, Davy Jones, Ed Roush, and Fred Snodgrass.  The stories they tell range  from Hans Lobert racing a horse around the bases while barnstorming through Oxnard, California, to  Fred Snodgrass defending his infamous muff; to a first hand account of the beaning death of Ray  Chapman at the hands of Carl Mays; and finally a wonderful recital of Casey at the Bat by Chief  Meyers.  At the end of many of the interviews Ritter asked the old timers if they had any regrets, and  not a single man did : of how few professions would this be true ?<br />I can't recommend the book highly enough and even if you've read it several times, be sure to give the  audio a listen.  This is oral history at its very best and an invaluable resource for baseball fans.  It does  for all of us what Ritter only belatedly realized it was doing for him, it provides a vital connection to  an earlier time, to the world of our fathers and grandfathers.

Meanwhile, John Wesley &quot;Jay&quot; Grobart was once a respected Army officer, a captain of  Mounted Rifles, but when he revenged himself upon the three fellow white men who raped and  murdered his Indian wife, Cat Dancing, he was sent to prison for ten years.  Now he's gotten a rather  motley gang together to rob a train.  Their paths cross when Catherine rides into the midst of the train  robbery and Grobart is forced to take her with him as they are pursued across the 1880's Wyoming  Territory by Harvey Lapchance--agent for Wells, Fargo and an ex-Pinkerton who just happens to be  the man who arrested Grobart those years ago--and his posse which, much to Lapchance's chagrin,  includes the loutish, violent, and increasingly drunken Harvey Crocker.<br />As they flee, Grobart has to try to protect Catherine from his unruly cohorts and from marauding  Indians.  In turn, she gradually unravels his secrets, learning that there was more to Cat Dancing's death  than folks realize and that Grobart is purposely headed into Indian territory to retrieve his children,  who are being raised by their Shoshone uncle, Iron Knife.  Initially forced together by mere  circumstance, there is an obvious attraction between Catherine and Grobart, but he is still very much  haunted by the past.  Catherine though, quickly adapts to her newfound freedom and turns out to be  more than a match for Grobart and for the ghost of Cat Dancing.<br />Many of the greatest Westerns have featured strong female characters (see Orrin's reviews of Shane,  Riders of the Purple Sage, and The Virginian), so this one is hardly groundbreaking, but Durham does  bring a distinctly feminist sensibility to the story and, though there's plenty of action, keeps her focus  on the relationship between Grobart and Catherine.  Grobart, tortured by memories of his past, is a  particularly compelling character, but it is Catherine's development into an independent and capable  woman which holds the story together.

Before the current generation of young folks, who not coincidentally came of age during the Reagan  years, the Republican Party was seemingly the exclusive province of square men.  We were the party of  guys like Bob Taft &amp; Barry Goldwater in their horn-rimmed glasses, of bald guys like Ike &amp; Gerry  Ford, of crew cut guys like Haldeman &amp; Ehrilchman, of complete doofuses like Nixon.  We weren't  just the party of men, but the party of old men. We were the Father Party.  Sure we had the occasional  snappy dish--Margaret Thatcher, Ayn Rand, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Phyllis Schafly, et. al--but they tended  to be a tad severe.  Democrats, for a variety of reasons, were the party of women, of the young, and of  the cool guys (not &quot;cool&quot; from the perspective of other men, but the guys, like the Kennedys and Bill  Clinton, who were smooth with the ladies).<br />I can't pinpoint the precise moment when this all changed, but that it has changed is a certainty, and  this became obvious during the impeachment of Bill Clinton.  Suddenly, instead of just having our  usual bland, middle-aged, white, spokesmen, like Bill McCollum and Arlen Specter (both perfectly  adequate, but hardly electrifying), whenever you turned on the television there was another  attractive-young-blonde-conservative-woman : Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham, Monica Crowley,  Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, Barbara Olson, to name a few.  And not only were they a-y-b-c-w's, they were  also extremely bright and frighteningly aggressive.  (Coulter, Ingraham and Olson are all attorneys, and  clerked for big time judges and Crowley attended the nation's premier institution of higher learning,  Colgate University.)  It's common enough for TV's talking heads to be chosen for their looks, more  than for their intellects, but this crew had the whole package.  I saw a couple of appearances by Ann  Coulter where I thought her opponents were going to either start crying or hide under a table--she knew  more than they did, held her views more strongly, and enunciated them more vociferously.<br />Meanwhile, who was left to defend Bill Clinton ? Bald guys like Carville.  Gay guys like Barney  Frank.  Severe women like Hilary, Donna Shalala, and Anne Lewis.  Dweeby guys like Henry  Waxman and Lanny Davis.  There may still have been enough women in the Democratic Party for Bill  Clinton to chase a few around the Oval Office, but, mirabile dictu, the smokin' hot, brainy chicks in  town were finally on our side.  And lest this seem like a pure creation of television, we were treated a  few years later to the spectacle of the Million Mom March, a bizarre gathering of humorless women  being harangued by the likes of Rosie O'Donnell about the evil of guns.  The whole thing resembled  nothing so much as the &quot;Two Minute Hate&quot; from George Orwell's 1984. They come off particularly  badly when contrasted with the competing rally by the Second Amendment Sisters, a raucous conclave  of conservative women devoted to preserving gun rights.  In this perfect bit of political allegory, the  Democrats had become the Mother Party, while the GOP was the party of pistol-packing sisters, and  other peoples' sisters at that.<br />Just how stunning a turn of events this was is readily apparent from the hysterical reaction of the Left  Wing press, which has either dismissed or attacked this new breed of conservative women.  A  particularly vile, but unfortunately not unique, manifestation of this trend was the Salon.com essay  suggesting that Ann Coulter needed to find a man.  There is, of course, a delicious irony in these sexist  attacks on conservative women; just imagine the howls of outrage if the perpetrators were conservative.<br />Any question though about the talents of Ms Coulter are ably answered in this book, which lays out,  with  devastating clarity and biting sarcasm, the casefor the impeachment of Bill Clinton.  Several  years after the fact, the presentation of the many Clinton scandals (up until 1998) may seem a tad  tiresome, but Coulter lays out the facts (as they were known at the time) in the succinct and logical  fashion that a good prosecutor would use.  One is tempted to believe--unable, as I am, to escape  delusion--that had the actual impeachment case been explained this well, it might have garnered more  support.  Then too, it is so persuasive that some of the bitterness of her invective seems out of place,  however justified.  Far be it from me to defend Bill Clinton, but comparisons to OJ Simpson seem  overdone, and unnecessary in light of the actual behavior she nails the President on.  The other quibble  with the book is mostly a function of when she wrote it : she repeatedly attacks the GOP dominated  Congress for not impeaching the President, which they, of course, did within months of the publication  of the book.<br />But these criticisms are minor in comparison to the great praise she deserves, not just for arguing the  facts so well, but more importantly, for  her compelling argument that Impeachment is (was) justified  based on those facts.  The book's greatest value may lie in this uniquely cogent brief for the proposition  that Impeachment was not viewed by the Founders as a radical solution to an unlikely set of events, but  was instead intended to be a regular part of Constitutional government, allowing for the efficient  removal of a President (or other official) who has not even necessarily done something illegal or  provably criminal, but has simply betrayed the public trust.  Regardless of your partisan political  leanings or your personal opinion of Bill Clinton, it's awfully hard to argue that having sex with an  intern in the Oval Office, trying to get her to lie about it in exchange for a job, trying to get her to  suborn the perjury of her friend (Linda Tripp), and lying about it yourself under oath (in the Paula  Jones case), are not betrayals of that trust.  In fact, just strip everything away except for the  incontrovertible fact that the President of the United States had an extramarital affair with a twenty-one  year old employee : this alone is, or should be, sufficient justification for impeachment.  If you doubt  it, imagine yourself trying to muster the chutzpah to ask George Washington if he thinks it's sufficient.<br />This return to first principles is especially useful because the President's defenders ignored all principles  and instead argued technicalities ad nauseum (what is the meaning of &quot;is&quot; ? what is the meaning of  sexual relations ? etc.), turning the entire process into little more than a legalistic game : no 100%  certain criminal liability = no impeachment.  To counter this, Coulter looks at the history of  impeachments here and in Britain, at the specific meaning of the &quot;high Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;  language, and at the writings of the Founders, to demonstrate that it is not the intent of the Constitution  to shield the President in all but those rare cases where he has demonstrably engaged in illegal activity,  but instead to allow the citizenry to replace a President whom they can no longer trust.<br />While noting that this more relaxed standard might be susceptible to abuse, though of course the stricter  standard is too, Coulter is careful to argue that the impeachable actions must not be merely politically  unpopular or mere mistakes.  Though not necessarily a criminal standard, impeachable actions should  violate a moral standard.  She quotes Madison to the effect that :<br />  The aim of every political constitution is, or ought to be, first to obtain for rulers men who possess  most wisdom to discern and most virtue to pursue the common good of the society; and in the next  place, to take the most effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst they continue to hold  their public trust.<br />This will sound quaint and unrealistic to many; why after all would we sophisticated moderns even  expect a President to be virtuous ?  But if we don't expect them to be and we don't hold them to this  standard, then we have no one to blame but ourselves when they disdain virtue.  As she puts it herself :<br />  [I]mpeachment is not just a matter of legal technicalities.  It is a matter of our duty as citizens.<br />Republicans, most of them anyway, did finally see fit to do that duty, but were never able to convince  the public or the Democrats that it was a shared duty.<br />Unfortunately for the country, it is one of the defining characteristics of Bill Clinton that he eventually  proves his critics right, no matter how outrageous their charges may seem at first glance.  And so, in  the waning days of his presidency we were all treated to a hard lesson in the consequences of not  removing such a miscreant from office.  Having sanctioned, either explicitly or implicitly, adultery,  sodomy, sexual assault, bribery, bank fraud, misuse of the IRS and FBI, obstruction of justice, perjury,  spurious and dilatory claims of executive privilege, and even something approaching treason, the public  and Democrats were left mouthin(in the Paula  Jones case), are not betrayals of that trust.

Here he's after even bigger game than his Dad and the military-industrial establishment, as he takes on the Catholic Church and Christianity itself.  His essential argument is that Christianity has been defined throughout its history by its anti-Judaism, that the resulting anti-Semitism led directly to the Holocaust, and that the failure to recognize and come to terms with these facts results in a continued, though perhaps unintentional, anti-Semitic aspect of modern Christianity.<br />  Auschwitz is the climax of the story that begins at Golgotha.  Just as the climax of Oedipus  Rex--the king sees that he is the killer--reveals that the hubris that drove the play's action was itself  the flaw that shaped the king's character, so we can already say that Auschwitz, when seen in the  links of causality, reveals that the hatred of Jews has been no incidental anomaly but a central action  of Christian character.  Jew hatred's perversion of the Gospel message launched a history, in other  words, that achieved its climax in the Holocaust, an epiphany presented so starkly it can no longer  be denied.  We shall see how defenders of the Church take pains to distinguish between  &quot;anti-Judaism&quot; and &quot;antisemitism&quot;; between Christian Jew-hatred as a &quot;necessary but sufficient&quot;  cause of the Holocaust; between the &quot;sins of the children&quot; and the sinlessness of the Church as such.  These distinctions become meaningless before the core truth of this history : Because the hatred of  Jews had been made holy, it became lethal.  The most sacred &quot;thinking and acting&quot; of the Church as  such must at last be called into question.<br />Let me not dither about this : James Carroll is entitled to his opposition to the Catholic Church but the views he expresses in this book are deranged.<br />...me not dither about this : James Carroll is entitled to his opposition to the Catholic Church but the views he expresses in this book are deranged. <br />...	2001-03-06

I dreamed, and behold, I  saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book  in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read  therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out  with a lamentable cry, saying, &quot;What shall I do?&quot;<br />  In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as long as he could, that his wife and  children should not perceive his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his trouble  increased. Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk  to them: &quot;O my dear wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear friend, am in  myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed  that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow, both myself,  with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I  see not) some way of escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered.&quot;  -John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress<br />Pilgrim's Progress, though hardly anyone reads it anymore, is one of the best-selling books of all time and was enormously influential for several centuries; in fact, we are still living under its influence.  However, like Dante's Inferno, it has passed out of favor in recent years, not because of its pedantry and antiquated style, but because much of its message is simply too harsh for the tenor of our times.<br />The narrator relates an allegorical dream in which Christian, having received knowledge that his city is to be destroyed by heavenly fire, leaves his wife and children and sets out on a quest for salvation which takes him to the Celestial City.  In the Second Book, his wife, Christiana, and the kids follow.  In their travels, they must pass through such places as The Valley of Humiliation and Death, the Slough of Despond, and Vanity Fair, and must resist the blandishments of folks like Ignorance and Hypocrisy.  Ultimately, all of the pilgrims do make it and enter through the gates of the City, saved by their unbroken faith.<br />It's easy to see why the story was so popular.  First, it's an exciting tale of adventure; one reviewer aptly refers to Christian as a Protestant Indiana Jones.  Second, it is triumphant, with Christian overcoming all the odds to arrive in the Celestial City, nor is there ever any real doubt that he is going to succeed.  Bunyan, who had become a Baptist preacher after a lifetime of tormenting dreams and struggles with doubt, wrote the story (and an autobiography) during two periods of imprisonment, one lasting twelve years, for holding services that were not in accordance with the teachings of the Church of England.  Especially in light of the author's circumstances, he expresses a bold certainty that Christian's path is in fact the path to Heaven.<br />But it's here that we see why the book is no longer popular.  Start with the idea that God's judgment is coming and that most of us face the fire this time.  Then add in the concept that Christian's are embattled by temptation and the sinners around them, and that many will succumb.  Top it all off with the notion that it is only by following in the Pilgrim's footsteps that you can attain salvation, that everyone else is doomed to Hell.  These aren't exactly the humanistic, inclusive, permissive doctrines which inform modernity are they ?<br />But there's one crucial tenet of Nonconformist Protestantism which Pilgrim's Progress captures and which is both the religion's greatest gift and worst legacy to modern times : the primacy of the individual.  John Bunyan experienced the struggle for faith as an intensely personal battle and his protagonist, Christian, likewise makes his pilgrimage alone.  It shocks our sensibilities for him to abandon his family and friends to their fiery fate, but such is his desire for &quot;eternal life&quot; that abandon them he does.  Here lies the two-edged sword of the radical Protestantism of the 16th and 17th centuries, for if it is true (and I think it is) that this emphasis on the individual in religious matters also spread to economic and political matters and brought about the concurrent rise of protestantism, democracy and capitalism, it is also true that this emphasis on the individual, if unchecked by morality, ethics and institutions, leads to the complete atomization of society and a cult of selfishness which undermines the very free society that it creates.  Personal freedom has been the greatest engine of progress that mankind has ever known, and it has been generated in large part by the Protestantism of which Bunyan was a part; but that same freedom, if torn loose from the laws, responsibilities and moral precepts out of which it grew, becomes mere license.  The individual, though paramount, is not sufficient.  Freedom, though vital, is not everything.  In particular, extreme individualism and liberty are inadequate ideals around which to build a civil society.<br />Christian's pilgrimage conveys the message that faith is the most important quality we bring to our approach towards God.  As theology, this doctrine of &quot;salvation through faith alone&quot; is harmless enough, and for all we know it is absolutely correct.  But in organizing Man's affairs here on Earth, we have to emphasize works as well as faith--works which manifest themselves in following the law, accepting one's responsibilities to one's fellow men, and behaving morally.  Otherwise, come Judgment Day, God won't have to smite us with heavenly fire, we'll have destroyed ourselves already.<br />Bunyan's book, besides being a rousing adventure tale, should be read both because of the influence it has exerted in shaping the modern world and because the issues it raises, of individualism and the like, are still just as important today, when they have gone to far, as they were when he was writing, and they had not come far enough.

At any given moment several of the positions you  adhere to will certainly be out of favor, but just as surely the tide will eventually turn back in your  favor.  New ideas and fancy fads will come and go, leaving trend-sucking liberals with their heads  spinning, but you can just stick to your guns and ignore them all, secure in the knowledge that folks  will eventually return to their senses and come scurrying back to the timeless virtues.  This is  especially the case when it comes to Crime and Punishment.  Few issues, other than the equally  intractable Taxation and Education,  have been so susceptible over the years to &quot;innovative&quot; thinking  and &quot;radical&quot; solutions as the problem of Crime.  But time and again we all end up returning to the  conservative mantra : what's needed are a societal emphasis on loving families and traditional morality,  vigorous law enforcement, and harsh punishments.<br />This book then is an unsurprising call for a return to these first principles, in particular a clarion call  for an effort to combat moral poverty, and, equally unsurprisingly, its policy prescriptions are  currently back in vogue. Between the candidacy of Joe Lieberman and the victory of George W. Bush,  religious belief is once again a central part of our national debate, morality is a hot topic, and a broad  consensus has formed around the idea that faith-based institutions, with their manifest moral  component, are better at delivering social services than government bureaucracies.  Coauthor John  DiIulio has, in fact, been named to be the coordinator of President Bush's Faith Based Initiative.  And,  what with now former President Clinton mired in a new scandal (which will inevitably come to be  known as Pardongate) Bill Bennett is popping up all over the networks and editorial pages, getting to  say, &quot;I told you so&quot; and preach the importance of morality in public life.<br />Meanwhile, in New York City, Rudy Guliani has proven that crime can be reduced and civic manners  restored by relentlessly prosecuting even minor infractions.  Perhaps most importantly, reforms like  building more prisons, Three Strikes and You're Out, mandatory sentencing, and incarcerating even  low level drug offenders, have helped to bring about a tremendous reduction in crime rates.  It would  seem that, in a sense, this book has been made superfluous by the very success of the ideas it  advocates.<br />But never fear, already we hear calls to relax drug laws (many of them fueled by the new movie  Traffic) amidst hand-wringing over the burgeoning prison population.  Perhaps the best aspect of this  book is that the authors actually go beyond just drugs and demonstrate the close connection between  alcohol and crime.  One of the most effective arguments of those who support legalization of drugs is  the comparison to alcohol.  The authors head off this line of reasoning by indicting alcohol too.  You've got to admire a conservatism so fierce and intellectually honest that it's basically willing to  refight some of the battles of Prohibition.<br />Another phenomenon we've witnessed in recent years is one of those patented psychic disconnects on  the part of liberals that we conservatives so treasure, folks on the Left have actually taken to arguing  that the statistics showing a drop in crime can not be right because of the size of the current prison  population.  Their characteristically fuzzy logic maintains that if crime really were going down there  would perforce be less people in prison.  This confusion over cause and effect, obvious as it seems,  and the accompanying appeals to middle class white guilt will inevitably lead to an eventual relaxing  of our guard and the pendulum will swing back towards leniency and permissiveness.<br />This book is somewhat dated now, because of its reliance on statistics and because too much of what it  has to say has been adopted as public policy, but put it on a shelf for a few years and you'll be able to  take it down during the next explosion in crime.  Think of public policy making as a huge game of  &quot;Whack the Mole&quot; conservatives always remain poised with the same hammer (a consistent set of  ideas) and periodically have to bang away with the hammer when experimentation with liberal ideas  manages to unleash a plague of vermin.

No one can, or should, deny the long and horrible history of racial oppression in this  country.  Racism is still a reality and, though it can never be expunged entirely, we should vigilantly  seek to limit its impact on the life of our nation.  But, by any objective measure, you would have to  say that the last fifty years have seen a tremendous amount of progress in the area of racial relations.  It is simply ridiculous to compare the status of black Americans today to that of blacks fifty, a hundred  or two hundred years ago.  And to argue that this is a uniquely dangerous moment in the history of  black America is to virtually beg to be dismissed, which Cornel West should be, as a kook and a crank.<br />Cornel West has built his entirely unjustified reputation as a serious philosopher on a bizarre blend of  Christian rhetoric and Marxist doctrine.  He is defined, for the most part, by his robust criticism of  liberal and conservative approaches to the problems of the black community, his dismissal of the  current crop of black political leaders and writers, and his own steadfast refusal to offer any ideas or  solutions of his own beyond the most general platitudes and completely discredited Marxist cant.  But  there's a method to his lack of a constructive message : his willingness to lash out at everyone else  (except Tony Morrison, for whatever reason), enables him to portray himself as an independent  thinker and his simultaneous willingness to identify problems but not to propose remedies, enables him  to exploit those maladies, even exacerbate them, for his own purposes.<br />You can get something of a feel for his modus operandi in his discussion of nihilism, which he  identifies as a central threat to black America :<br />  The proper starting point for the crucial debate about the prospects for black America is an  examination of the nihilism that increasingly pervades black communities.  Nihilism is to be  understood here not as a philosophic doctrine that there are no rational grounds for legitimate  standards or authority; it is, far more, the lived experience of coping with a life of horrifying  meaninglessness, hopelessness, and (most important) lovelessness.  The frightening result is a  numbing detachment from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world.  Life without  meaning, hope, and love breeds a coldhearted, mean-spirited outlook that destroys both the  individual and others.<br />  Nihilism is not new in black America.  The first African encounter with the New World was an  encounter with a distinctive form of the Absurd.  The initial black struggle against degradation and  devaluation in the enslaved circumstances of the New World was, in part, a struggle against  nihilism.  In fact, the major enemy of black survival in America has been and is neither oppression  nor exploitation but rather the nihilistic threat--that is, loss of hope and absence of meaning.  For as  long as hope remains and meaning is preserved, the possibility of overcoming oppression stays  alive.  The self-fulfilling prophecy of the nihilistic threat is that without hope there can be no  future, that without meaning there can be no struggle.<br />  The genius of our black foremothers and forefathers was to create powerful buffers to ward off the  nihilistic threat, to equip black folk with cultural armor to beat back the demons of hopelessness,  meaninglessness, and lovelessness.  These buffers consisted of cultural structures of meaning and  feeling that created and sustained communities; this armor constituted ways of life and struggle that  embodied values of service and sacrifice, love and care, discipline and excellence.  In other words,  traditions for black surviving and thriving under usually adverse New World conditions were major  barriers against the nihilistic threat.  These traditions consisted primarily of black religious and  communal networks of support. ...<br />  What has changed ? What went wrong ? ... None of us fully understands why the cultural structures  that once sustained black life in America are no longer able to fend off the nihilistic threat.  I  believe that two significant reasons why the threat is more powerful now than ever before are the  saturation of market forces and market moralities in black life and the present crisis in black  leadership.<br />Okay, I buy a certain amount of this analysis : yes, the biggest problems in urban black America are  the decline of the church and the end of the nuclear family, the two institutions most responsible for  providing community support to people.  But what's this about no one understanding what happened to  them ?  The 60's happened.  The Great Society, which West lauds elsewhere, happened.  Government  stepped in and tried to replace existing institutions, most disastrously by creating economic incentives  for people not to work and to have children out of wedlock.  At the same time, the cultural Left, of  which West is now a part, sought to free morality from its religious tether, with the entirely  predictable result that moral standards lost their validity.<br />Yet where does West place the blame ?  He points at black leaders (we'll give him that one) and at free  markets.  But is there anywhere in the United States where capitalism was more restricted by  government regulation than in America's major urban areas ?  Mind that this book was written before  the GOP took over Congress and passed Welfare Reform, and before Republican mayors took over  several of America's biggest cities : as the past few years have demonstrated, it actually turns out that  when you restore law and order and bring market forces to bear on black inner cities you can increase  employment, reduce crime, and reduce teen pregnancy.<br />What West was doing was contributing to the problem, by suggesting that it was hopeless.  He had no  positive alternatives.  Here he is describing the choice between liberal and conservative policies :<br />  The liberal notion that more government programs can solve racial problems is simplistic--precisely  because it focuses on the economic dimension. And the conservative idea that what is needed is a  change in the moral behavior of poor black urban dwellers (especially poor black men, who, they  say, should stay married, support their children, and stop committing so much crime) highlights  immoral actions while ignoring public responsibility for the immoral circumstances that haunt our  fellow citizens.<br />Yeah, okay, there is a moral dimension, not just an economic one, to the problem.  Conservatives have  identified some moral solutions.  But at the point where West's analysis would lead a more  open-minded person inexorably toward those solutions, he instead chooses to focus on blaming  someone for the circumstances as they exist.  It turns out he's quite right about the problem with black  leadership, as his own failure shows.  These leaders, like West, are so busy parceling out blame for the  past, they have no time to work on solutions for the future.<br />Would that this were the only example of such willful backwardness in the book, but most of the  essays are filled with similarly retrograde notions.  There's a profoundly silly one called, &quot;Black  Sexuality : The Taboo Subject,&quot; which assumes that whites still view blacks like they did Tom  Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird : like it's just one easy step from breakingup a chifforobe to  having their way with our poor, innocent women :<br />  White fear of black sexuality is a basic ingredient of white racism. And for whites to admit this  deep fear even as they try to instill and sustain fear in blacks is to acknowledge a weakness -- a  weakness that goes down to the bone. Social scientists have long acknowledged that interracial sex  and marriage is the most perceived source of white fear of black people -- just as the repeated  castrations of lynched black men cries out for serious psychocultural explanation.<br />Castrations of lynched black men ?  We all recall the tragic murder of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas,  but we're not exactly in the midst of a castration epidemic.<br />Equally inane, though considerably more harmful, is his take on affirmative action.  While  acknowledging that such programs are counterproductive, because they make even worthy  beneficiaries feel like they are cheating to get ahead, he advocates maintaining them simply as pay  back for past discrimination.<br />What is it finally that West calls for as his solution to the problems of black An in America's major urban areas ?

Supposedly based on true  events, it tells the story of a New York City couple, Flanders (Flan) and Louisa (Ouisa) Kittredge,  unsuccessful private art dealers who are desperately clinging to their Manhattan socialite lifestyle.  Flan is cash strapped and badly needs to turn up some money to complete a two million dollar deal.  One night, as they are hitting up a South African acquaintance for some money, a young black man,  Paul, turns up on their doorstep.  He claims to be a Harvard classmate of their kids who has just been  mugged in Central Park.  Any initial resistance they may feel towards this stranger evaporates when he  cooks them and their guest dinner,  expounds on Catcher in the Rye, reveals that his father is Sidney  Poitier, and intimates that he might be able to get them all jobs as extras in his Dad's movie version of  Cats.  He plays their liberal guilt and their social climbing hunger to perfection and makes such an  impression on the South African that he agrees to invest with Flan on the art deal.  The grateful couple  allow Paul to stay overnight in their apartment while they go out.<br />His implausible story begins to unravel though when, returning early to their apartment, they find him  in bed with a male street hustler and throw them both out.  Flan takes particular relish in telling the  story of their visitor and they are surprised to find that Paul has similarly hustled a number of their  friends.  They, especially Ouisa, become obsessed with finding out who Paul really is; apparently just  a street hustler.  He drops back into their lives several times, and they are tangentially involved in a  scandal when Paul seduces and dumps a young man who then commits suicide.<br />Most of the philosophizing in the play, with the exception of the Six Degrees concept, is fairly silly  and the people are immensely annoying.  There are some funny lines, but most of the humor comes  from watching the loathsome Kittredges humiliate themselves repeatedly.  It is perhaps the ultimate  comment on the kind of people that the play portrays that none of it is very believable.  Despite the  nonfiction origins, it strains credulity to believe that people who are this shallow actually exist.  I'd  recommend it mildly, but only for its cruel treatment of a group of people I don't much like--upper  class NY City liberals.  The LA Theatre Works production has the added bonus that Flan is played by  Alan Alda in a near self caricature.<br />GRADE : Cis fairly silly  and the people are immensely annoying.

It was not from Aesop, the Old Testament, or Homer.  It was  history--his history.<br />I don't know whether it is, in fact, a true story, but as Armstrong's own assertion acknowledges, it is  the stuff of myth.<br />Sounder is the loyal coon hunting dog of a family of black sharecroppers.  At the heart of the tale is  the oldest son in this family, plagued by loneliness, helpless rage, and a burning desire to learn to  read.  The owner of the land they live on has been careful to space families out, presumably so that  they won't band together, so they basically have no neighbors and it is too far for the boy to walk to  school.  The boy's parents are strong willed, and his mother is deeply religious, but they are very  reserved.  The boy is very much alone, more so because he can't read, and Sounder is very nearly his  best friend.  Even this rather isolated world is shattered though when the father is sent to prison for  stealing a ham and the men who come to take him away shoot Sounder in the process.<br />The story of how first Sounder and then the family heal themselves and of how the boy eventually  learns to read are really moving.  The fact that only Sounder is given a name in the story adds to the  mythic quality and the mother's constant singing of &quot;Lonesome Valley&quot; imparts a Biblical touch.

Think of it as a cross between Tom Clancy and Graham Greene (see Orrin's review  of The Quiet American)--with the civil servant as superhero trying to navigate a moral cesspool.  Bradley Lawrence Marshall is the blue blood, war hero, diplomat who is sent to Vietnam as the  personal emissary of President Johnson, to find a way out.  In country, he meets with real figures like  General Westmoreland, who tries to convince him everything is copacetic.  But he also meets folks  like: his driver, Corporal Mead, a decent though violent American lad of ambiguous sexuality, who is  sick of the war; Lacouture, a flamboyant, Guy Burgess-like, Frenchman who sells information to all  sides and loves Mead; and the insidious CIA station chief, Wilson Abbot Lord, who lives to fight the  Communists and, fearing that Marshall will end the war, plots to kill him.  And it's all set against the  backdrop of the Tet Offensive.<br />The whole premise, of Johnson and a bureaucrat secretly planning an exit strategy, doesn't withstand  much scrutiny and the stereotypes and clich&eacute;s run rampant.  But taken on its own terms, as a sort of  politico-military potboiler with only mild pretensions of addressing issues in any serious way, it  succeeds pretty well.

Christian societies were responsible for an engagement to slavery in its most hideous, dehumanizing  form.  ... Islam has been, by specific spiritual precept and in common practice, relatively humane in  its treatment of slaves and its readiness to free them...  -Ronald Segal, Author's Preface to Islam's Black Slaves<br />This truly odd book details the horrors of the enslavement of black Africans in the Islamic world--a  traffic in human beings which equaled in volume that of the better known Atlantic slave trade  (totaling  some 11 million blacks in each case), and which continues to this day, particularly in places like the  Sudan--but at the same time seeks to differentiate Islam's treatment of slaves, which is portrayed as  relatively enlightened and beneficent, from the harsher treatment of blacks, both slave and free, in the  West.  Though I had trouble finding much biographical information on Segal, his motivation in this  exercise appears to be twofold.  First, there's the simple necessity to explain, not merely the absence of  racial tension in the modern Islamic world, but also the absence of blacks : where, after all, did the 11  million go ?  Why is there no conspicuous black culture in the Middle East ?  Second, based on the  admittedly sketchy evidence I could find : that Segal, a white South African, was a significant player in  the ANC in the late 50s &amp; early 60s and that his prior books include a biography of Trotsky and Race  War, which apparently predicted such a war in America, it seems safe to assume that, if not a Marxist,  he is at least a Leftist, which would tend to suggest that his exoneration of Islam may be intended to  indict the West.<br />In presenting the history of the African slave trade, Segal perforce has to concede the thorough  involvement of Arabs in the capture, sale and transport of black Africans.  Likewise, he acknowledges  that the Islamic world did make just as extensive use of black slaves as did the West.  But he  differentiates the treatment of blacks by Muslim captors, suggesting several religious bases for it :<br />  * Islam's unique blend of the religious and the political into a unitary system  mitigated against the  development of capitalist economies, so that blacks tended to be used in households rather than in  heavy manual labor.<br />  * The Koran specifically commands Muslims to treat slaves well and offers inducements in the next  world to those who free their slaves.<br />  * While the gender ratio of slaves imported to the West was 2-1 male to female, the exact opposite  was true in the Islamic world.  This high ratio of household female slaves and a tradition of  polygamy and concubinage, led to the use of blacks as sex objects, and in the absence of systemic  racism and theories of racial superiority, mixed race offspring tended to be accepted into the  household and the subsequent freeing of the children's mothers.<br />These factors account for the milder treatment of blacks and, in part, for their assimilation into Islamic  society.  Several other factors help to account for the disappearance of a distinct black populace :<br />  * Males slaves were frequently turned into eunuchs--so obviously they had no offspring.<br />  * Many of the rest were used as soldiers, with resulting low survival rates.<br />  * For unexplained reasons, African slave women imported to the Islamic states had extraordinarily  low fertility rates.<br />  * Mortality rates among Islam's black slaves were extremely high, from adverse treatment, disease,  and other causes.<br />In the end, Segal suggests, a combination of death, infertility (naturally occurring and man made) and  miscegenation must account for the disappearance of blacks and blackness from the Islamic Middle  East.<br />This brings us to an intriguing question : does the absence of racial tension in the Islamic world  necessarily indicate that the experience of black Africans was in fact less horrific than in the West ?  Segal kind of glides past the rather important fact that using blacks for sex (heterosexual and  homosexual, which he says was prevalent) and making them eunuchs constituted physical assault on a  rather massive scale.  Nowhere does he refer to the sexual practices as what they really were : rape.  Nor is it possible to figure out why he considers the systematic neutering of black males to be less  objectionable than the forced physical labor of the American South.  The key sentence in the book may  be the following :<br />  While slavery in the West was directed to the productive economy, in the Ottoman Empire it was a  form of consumption.<br />I recognize that to some people the worst fate possible is to be treated as a mere cog in the means of  production, but I'm uncertain that most of us would agree with Segal that it is better to be an object for  consumption.  At the point where you have to debate whether cotton picking or sexual degradation was  more dehumanizing, I think it's safest to admit that both Islam and the West were responsible for  monstrous treatment of innocent peoples and leave it at that.<br />The secondary issue which arises is : given a choice, and it is admittedly an awful choice, would people  choose the suffering they underwent in the West, but emergence with the vibrant and vital black culture  we see in America today; or the complete (forced) assimilation that took place in the Islamic world  with the resulting annihilation of the race as a race ?  I'd suggest the answer to this is very much a  subject for debate.  We pay frequent lip service to the idea of creating a color blind society, but we all  cling pretty fiercely to our respective ethnic heritages.  And it's not like you hear Arabs celebrating the  fact that they are the product of extensive racial intermingling.  The modern Islamic world may very  well be to a significant degree the product of those 11 million black slaves, but if it is, they are awfully  quiet about that fact, which does not suggest such an enlightened attitude.<br />It is also difficult to reconcile the continuing Islamic slave trade with the idea of enlightenment.  Segal  discusses the ongoing traffic in human beings that is occurring even today in places like the Sudan--A.  M. Rosenthal wrote a piece for the NY Times several years ago in which he said that there are still tens  of thousands of slaves in the Sudan.  We have to acknowledge that racial violence continues in the  United States, but such incidents are isolated and are met with society wide outrage,  Even if, for the  sake of argument, we concede that plantation-style slavery was more oppressive for blacks than Islamic  slavery, the Christian world would certainly seem to be winning the comparison now, and for the last  few decades, at least.<br />As to Segal's motivation, I can only point to a couple of cryptic remarks as evidence of my theory that  he is driven by a dislike of the West.

Segal  discusses the ongoing traffic in human beings that is occurring even today in places like the Sudan--A.  M. Rosenthal wrote a piece for the NY Times several years ago in which he said that there are still tens  of thousands of slaves in the Sudan.  We have to acknowledge that racial violence continues in the  United States, but such incidents are isolated and are met with society wide outrage,  Even if, for the  sake of argument, we concede that plantation-style slavery was more oppressive for blacks than Islamic  slavery, the Christian world would certainly seem to be winning the comparison now, and for the last  few decades, at least.<br />As to Segal's motivation, I can only point to a couple of cryptic remarks as evidence of my theory that  he is driven by a dislike of the West.  At one point he characterizes the Western economic system as  &quot;an ultimate totalitarianism of money&quot; and he elsewhere speaks of capitalism as &quot;the effective  subjugation of people to the priority of profit.&quot;  These assessments, and several similar, and the general  tone of the book, betray a general hostility to the organizing principles of Western society.

Ere Babylon was dust,  the Magus Zoroaster, my dead child,  Met his own image  Walking in the garden.  That apparition, sole of men, he saw.  -Percy Bysshe Shelley, Prometheus Unbound<br />Charles Williams is less well known than his fellow Inklings, like C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien,  but like them he wrote a series of novels which combine elements of fantasy and Christian symbolism.  The action of Descent into Hell takes place in Battle Hill, outside London, amidst the townspeople's  staging of a new play by Peter Stanhope.  The hill seems to reside at the crux of time, as characters  from the past appear, and perhaps at a doorway to the beyond, as characters are alternately summoned  heavenwards or descend into hell.<br />Pauline Anstruther, the heroine of the novel, lives in fear of meeting her own doppelganger, which has  appeared to her throughout her life.  But Stanhope, in an action central to the author's own theology,  takes the burden of her fears upon himself--Williams called this The Doctrine of Substituted  Love--and enables Pauline, at long last, to face her true self.  Williams drew this idea from the biblical  verse, &quot;Ye shall bear one another's burdens :&quot;<br />  She said, still perplexed at a strange language : 'But how can I cease to be troubled ?  will it leave  off coming because I pretend it wants you ?  Is it your resemblance that hurries up the street ?'<br />  'It is not,' he said, 'and you shall not pretend at all.  The thing itself you may one day meet--never  mind that now, but you'll be free from all distress because that you can pass on to me.  Haven't you  heard it said that we ought to bear one another's burdens ?'<br />  'But that means---' she began, and stopped.<br />  'I know,' Stanhope said.  'It means listening sympathetically, and thinking unselfishly, and being  anxious about, and so on.  Well, I don't say a against all that; no doubt it helps.  But I think when  Christ or St. Paul, or whoever said bear, or whatever he Aramaically said instead of bear, he  meant something much more like carrying a parcel instead of someone else.  To bear a burden is  precisely to carry it instead of.  If you're still carrying yours, I'm not carrying it for you--however  sympathetic I may be.  And anyhow there's no need to introduce Christ, unless you wish.  It's a fact  of experience.  If you give a weight to me, you can't be carrying it yourself; all I'm asking you to  do is to notice that blazing truth.  It doesn't sound very difficult.'<br />And so Stanhope does take the weight, with no surreptitious motive, in the most affecting scene in the  novel.  And Pauline, liberated, is able to accept truth.<br />On the other hand, Lawrence Wentworth, a local historian, finding his desire for Adela Hunt to be  unrequited, falls in love instead with a spirit form of Adela, which seems to represent a kind of  extreme self love on his part.<br />  The shape of Lawrence Wentworth's desire had emerged from the power of his body.  He had  assented to that making, and again, outside the garden of satisfied dreams, he had assented to the  company of the shape which could not be except by his will and was imperceptibly to possess his  will.  Image without incarnation, it was the delight of his incarnation for it was without any of the  things that troubled him in the incarnation of the beloved.  He could exercise upon it all arts but  one; he could not ever discover by it or practise towards it freedom of love.  A man cannot love  himself; he can only idolize it, and over the idol delightfully tyrannize--without purpose.  The great  gift which the simple idolatry os self gives is lack of further purpose; it is, the saints tell us, a  somewhat similar thing that exists in those wholly possessed by their End; it is, human experience  shows, the most exquisite delight in the interchanges of romantic love.  But in all loves but one  there are counterpointing times of purpose; in this only there are none.<br />As he isolates himself more and more with this insubstantial figure, and dreams of descending a silver  rope into a dark pit, Wentworth begins the descent into Hell.<br />Because of the way that time and space and the supernatural all converge upon Battle Hill, the book  can be somewhat confusing.  But it is rich in atmosphere and unusual ideas and it is unlike any other  book I've ever read.  It is challenging, but ultimately rewarding if you stick with it.<br />GRADE : Bc love.

It tells not only its own story of grief, but speaks of a thousand wrongs and woes beside,  which never see the light; all the more bitter and dreadful, because no help can relieve, no sympathy  can mitigate, and no hope can cheer.  -William Wells Brown, Clotel, or The President's Daughter<br />Clotel would have historic interest simply by virtue of the fact that William Wells Brown appears to  have been the first African American to write a novel.  But it's not merely a literary curiosity; it is also  an eminently readable and emotionally powerful, if forgivably melodramatic, portrait of the  dehumanizing horrors of slave life in the Ante-bellum South.  Brown, himself an escaped slave, tells  the story of the slave Currer and her daughters, Clotel and Althesa, and of their attempts to escape from  slavery.  The central conceit of the story is that the unacknowledged father of the girls is Thomas  Jefferson himself.<br />There is an immediacy to the stories here--of slave auctions, of families being torn apart, of card games  where humans are wagered and lost, of sickly slaves being purchased for the express purpose of resale  for medical experimentation upon their imminent deaths, of suicides and of many more indignities and  brutalities--which no textbook can adequately convey.  Though the characters tend too much to the  archetypal, Brown does put a human face on this most repellent of American tragedies. He also makes  extensive use (so extensive that he has been accused, it seems unfairly, of plagiarism) of actual  sermons, lectures, political pamphlets, newspaper advertisements, and the like, to give the book  something of a docudrama effect.<br />The Bedford Cultural Edition of the book, edited by Robert S. Levine, has extensive footnotes and a  number of helpful essays on Brown and on the sources, even reproducing some of them verbatim.  Overall, it gives the novel the kind of serious presentation and treatment which it deserves, but for  obvious reasons has not received in the past.  Brown's style is naturally a little bit dated and his passions  are too distant for us to feel them immediately, but as you read the horrifying scenes of blacks being  treated like chattel, you quickly come to share his moral outrage at this most shameful chapter in our  history.<br />GRADE : Btim.

Here was a man who was less well spoken and less brilliant than many of his peers.  He was not a great philosophical or political thinker.  He lost most of the military engagements he led.  And yet, the men of whom we think more highly in these regards almost universally revered him.  What quality was it that made men like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and the Marquise de Lafayette defer to him ?  The answer must surely lie in the character of the man, and character seems to be a uniquely difficult quality to convey in writing. Perhaps it is actually impossible to describe the quality itself; instead the effects of it must be described.<br />One example from Washington's life seems to me to stand out above all others : his handling of the Newburgh Conspiracy.  When, after the War, disgruntled officers, led by Horatio Gates, circulated a letter suggesting that the Army march on Congress to demand back pay and hinted at taking control of the government, Washington used a simple but elegant ploy to defuse the crisis.  Having summoned the men to his tent so that he could read a letter meant to dissuade them from their proposed course of action, he paused, reached into a pocket, and withdrew a pair of glasses, which, thanks in large part to his vanity, few knew he even required.  As he unfolded them and put them on, he said :<br />  Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray, but almost  blind in the service of my country.<br />It is reported, perhaps with some hyperbole, that men wept; but at any rate, the insurrection crumbled.<br />It is hard for us, jaded as we have become about our leaders, to imagine the drama of this scene and the effect it must have had on his comrades, but then again, we are unfortunate enough to have a recent Commander in Chief whose preference in underwear, bizarre sexual proclivities, and genital deformities were all common knowledge.  It is perhaps instructive that when he was at Boys' State as a teenager (as related in David Maraniss's excellent biography First in His Class), Bill Clinton devoted himself to one single purpose and achieved it : to have his picture taken with President Kennedy.  At a similar age, sixteen year old George Washington copied by hand 110 maxims from a guidebook on manners originally compiled by Jesuits in 1595.  Both men were trying to improve themselves, but there's a key difference : Clinton sought a photo opportunity that would be personally gratifying and which he might use to advance his political career down the road; Washington sought out those precepts which would help him to discipline himself, to develop his character, and to make himself more presentable to society.  The fundamental object of Clinton's effort was personal aggrandizement, of Washington's, to make himself a better person.<br />In this little book Richard Brookhiser, who wrote a terrific biography of Washington, reproduces the 110 &quot;Rules of Civility&quot; in a much easier form to read than the original text (for example, check out an online version), along with a brief introductory essay and explanatory, often amusing, comments on many of the rules.  Here are some examples (with Brookhiser's comments in italics where applicable) :<br />  (1)  Every action done in company ought to be done with some sign of respect to those that are  present.<br />  (4)  In the presence of others, sing not to yourself with a humming noise or drum with your  fingers or feet.<br />  Don't carry a boom box either.<br />  (13)  Kill no vermin, as fleas, lice, ticks, etc., in the sight of others.  If you see any filth or thick<br />  spittle put your foot dexterously upon it, if it be upon the clothes of your companions put it  off privately, and if it beupon your own clothes return thanks to him who puts it off.<br />  Useful advice on the frontier.  In 1748, when Washington was sixteen, he went surveying in<br />  the Blue Ridge mountains and was obliged to sleep under &quot;one thread bare blanket with  double its weight of vermin.&quot;  The last two clauses are useful anywhere:  Don't embarrass  those you help, and however embarrassed you may be to discover that you have been in a  ludicrous or disgusting situation, don't forget to thank those who helped you out of it.<br />As the last example demonstrates, many of the rules seem at first to be hopelessly antiquated, but on further reflection, in the concern they display for personal dignity and humility, thoughtfulness of and respect for others, maintenance of civil standards, they are truly timeless.  The final precept is the most famous and allows Brookhiser to sum up all that have come before :<br />  (110)  Labour to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.<br />  The only open reminder of what has been implicit all along: Petty morals and large  morals are linked; there are no great spirits who do not pay attention to both; these  little courtesies reflect, as in a pocket mirror, the social and the moral order.<br />And this is the significance of Washington's attention to these seemingly petty rules, that the conscience is only a spark and that it may be extinguished unless one labors to maintain it.  Because Washington did take that labor seriously throughout his life, he had the reserve of respect and honor built up with others which enabled him to cow the rebellious officers at Newburgh and had the personal moral fiber which enabled him, at the vital moments in the life of the new republic, to refuse political power, both when it was there for the taking and when it was freely offered.  In some sense, these 110 maxims helped to create the man of whom King George III said, when he heard that General Washington planned to surrender command of the Continental Army to retire to his farm :<br />  If he indeed does that, he will be the greatest man in the world.<br />That assessment, from a humiliated enemy, was accurate then, and the bloody course of every subsequent revolution, suggests that it may understate the case.<br />GRADE : Aupon the clothes of your companions put it                off privately, and if it be upon your own clothes return thanks to him who puts it off. <br />            Useful advice on the frontier.

The &quot;valentine&quot; is the corpse of a young gay homeless man, with a heart tattoo, that's  left near his cave.  When the dead man's lover comes to Romulus with a story about a famous artist  who used the victim as a model in his work, but then tortured and probably killed him, the Caveman  decides to investigate, despite objections from his police officer daughter.  Romulus is motivated at  least in part by his own belief that the murder may be the work of his arch nemesis, Cornelius Gould  Stuyvesant, the evil criminal genius who lurks in the Chrysler Building, beaming his Y Rays  throughout the unsuspecting city.<br />In spite of, or oftentimes because of, his delusional fantasies, Romulus is an engaging hero.  His  homeless status makes him the ultimate outsider, and his frequent inability to separate reality from  insanity and his warped certainty that everything is part of a huge conspiracy directed by Stuyvesant  lend the story a tense nightmarish quality.  Though the book is overlong by at least fifty pages and  telegraphs its punches a tad too much, the Caveman is a sufficiently unusual and interesting character  to make it worthwhile.<br />GRADE : B	2001-02-13

It was only upon his death, in 1918, that his third person  autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams, was published and that his publisher revealed that  Adams had written the previously anonymous novel Democracy.  It is The Education which has  sustained his reputation, having been named the number one book on the Modern Library list of the  Top 100 Nonfiction Books of the 20th Century, but Democracy is still considered one of the better  novels of American politics, though surprisingly it is currently out of print.<br />The novel is both a fairly typical 19th Century comedy of manners--with the widow Madeleine Lee  decamping from New York to Washington DC, where she instantly becomes one of the Capital's most desirable catches--and a more serious meditation on the nature and pursuit of power in the American  democracy.  The widow Lee is specifically interested in Washington because it is the seat of power :<br />  ...she was bent upon getting to the heart of the great American mystery of democracy and  government.<br />  . . .<br />  What she wished to see, she thought, was the clash of interests, the interests of forty millions of  people and a whole continent, centering at Washington; guided, restrained, controlled, or  unrestrained and uncontrollable, by men of ordinary mould; the tremendous forces of government,  and the machinery of society at work. What she wanted was POWER.<br />Mrs. Lee's most likely pursuer is Senator Silas Ratcliffe of Illinois, widely considered a likely future  President : he sees her as a perfect First Lady and she sees him as her path to power.  Through an  elaborate courtship ritual and several set piece scenes (in the Senate, at the White House, at Mount  Vernon, at Arlington Cemetery and at a dress ball) Adams puts his characters through their paces and  affords the reader an intimate look at the rather tawdry political milieu of the 1870's.  The theme that  runs throughout the story is that access to power comes only through compromising one's principles,  but Adams is sufficiently ambivalent about the point that we're uncertain whether he's more  contemptuous of those who make the necessary deals or those who, by staying &quot;pure,&quot; sacrifice the  opportunity to influence affairs of state.  Suffice it to say that the novel ends with Mrs. Lee, assumed  by most critics  to represent Adams himself, fleeing to Egypt, telling her sister : &quot;Democracy has  shaken my nerves to pieces.&quot;<br />Like his presidential forebears, Henry Adams had a realistic and therefore jaundiced view of politics,  even as practiced in a democracy.  The Adams's did not subscribe to the starry eyed idealism of the  Jeffersonians.  But they were all drawn to politics, even realizing that it was a moral quagmire.  This is  the fundamental dilemma of the conservative democrat, we recognize that we have to govern ourselves  because we know we can't trust unelected rulers, but we also understand that our elected  representatives are unlikely to be any more honest than the tyrants we threw out.  This attitude is  famously captured in Winston Churchill's (alleged) aphorism : &quot;Democracy: the worst of all possible  systems, but there is no other which would be better.&quot;  And the unfortunate corollary is that unless  relatively honorable men like the Adamses and the Churchills pursue careers in politics, the field will  be left to the real scoundrels.

I mean think about it for a second, Chambers, who spent half his life as a bisexual  Communist spy, was also a leading light of TIME and the National Review, a friend of Richard Nixon  and William F. Buckley, was awarded a posthumous Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan, and made  many conservatives' end-of-century lists, both for this memoir and for his personal influence.  That's a  fairly interesting resume by anyone's standards.<br />Chambers would be a heroic figure to the Right even if he had done nothing else but to accuse Alger  Hiss of being a Communist spy.  This action, so divisive that it still echoes through our politics today,  helped to define the Cold War era, forcing people to choose sides--between anti-Communists, on the  one side and communists, communist sympathizers and fellow travelers, and Anti-Anti-Communists on  the other--and in turn hardening the lines between the sides as the nation headed into a period of  prolonged cultural civil war, from which we have still not truly emerged.<br />But Chambers did not merely attack one man.  With his memoir Witness he declared war on  Communism and the Soviet Union and explained in no uncertain terms just what the struggle was  about--what was at stake, the methods that the other side was using, and the seriousness of purpose  which would be required to defeat them--and at the same time he told a life story which somehow  managed to unite nearly all of the themes of modernity in one gloriously messy tale of personal  degradation and desperation, followed by political and religious redemption and salvation.  And to top  it all off, not only does the story have all of the elements of a thriller and a courtroom drama, the  author just happens to write brilliantly.<br />Chambers starts the book out with a forward in the form of a letter to his children (available on-line  and well worth checking out) which seeks to explain why the book is necessary and why their father  gained such notoriety in the first place.  It is worth quoting a largish chunk :<br />  Beloved Children,<br />  I am sitting in the kitchen of the little house at Medfield, our second farm which is cut off by the  ridge and a quarter-mile across the fields from our home place, where you are. I am writing a book.  In it I am speaking to you. But I am also speaking to the world. To both I owe an accounting.<br />  It is a terrible book. It is terrible in what it tells about men. If anything, it is more terrible in what it  tells about the world in which you live. It is about what the world calls the Hiss-Chambers Case, or  even more simply, the Hiss Case. It is about a spy case. All the props of an espionage case are  there--foreign agents, household traitors, stolen documents, microfilm, furtive meetings, secret  hideaways, phony names, an informer, investigations, trials, official justice.<br />  But if the Hiss Case were only this, it would not be worth my writing about or your reading about.  It would be another fat folder in the sad files of the police, another crime drama in which the props  would be mistaken for the play (as many people have consistently mistaken them). It would not be  what alone gave it meaning, what the mass of men and women instinctively sensed it to be, often  without quite knowing why. It would not be what, at the very beginning, I was moved to call it: &quot;a  tragedy of history.&quot;<br />  For it was more than human tragedy. Much more than Alger Hiss or Whittaker Chambers was on  trial in the trials of Alger Hiss. Two faiths were on trial. Human societies, like human beings, live  by faith and die when faith dies. At issue in the Hiss Case was the question whether this sick  society, which we call Western civilization, could in its extremity still cast up aman whose faith in  it was so great that he would voluntarily abandon those things which men hold good, including life,  to defend it. At issue was the question whether this man's faith could prevail against a man whose  equal faith it was that this society is sick beyond saving, and that mercy itself pleads for its swift  extinction and replacement by another. At issue was the question whether, in the desperately divided  society, there still remained the will to recognize the issues in time to offset the immense rally of  public power to distort and pervert the facts.<br />  At heart, the Great Case was this critical conflict of faiths; that is why it was a great case. On a scale  personal enough to be felt by all, but big enough to be symbolic, the two irreconcilable faiths of our  time--Communism and Freedom--came to grips in the persons of two conscious and resolute men.  Indeed, it would have been hard, in a world still only dimly aware of what the conflict is about, to  find two other men who knew so clearly. Both had been schooled in the same view of history (the  Marxist view). Both were trained by the same party in the same selfless, semisoldierly discipline.  Neither would nor could yield without betraying, not himself, but his faith; and the different  character of these faiths was shown by the different conduct of the two men toward each other  throughout the struggle. For, with dark certitude, both knew, almost from the beginning, that the  Great Case could end only in the destruction of one or both of the contending figures, just as the  history of our times (both men had been taught) can end only in the destruction of one or both of  the contending forces.<br />  But this destruction is not the tragedy. The nature of tragedy is itself misunderstood. Part of the  world supposes that the tragedy in the Hiss Case lies in the acts of disloyalty revealed. Part believes  that the tragedy lies in the fact that an able, intelligent man, Alger Hiss, was cut short in the course  of a brilliant public career. Some find it tragic that Whittaker Chambers, of his own will, gave up a  $30,000-a-year job and a secure future to haunt for the rest of his days the ruins of his life. These  are shocking facts, criminal facts, disturbing facts: they are not tragic.<br />  Crime, violence, infamy are not tragedy. Tragedy occurs when a human soul awakes and seeks, in  suffering and pain, to free itself from crime, violence, infamy, even at the cost of life. The struggle  is the tragedy--not defeat or death. That is why the spectacle of tragedy has always filled men, not  with despair, but with a sense of hope and exaltation. That is why this terrible book is also a book  of hope For it is about the struggle of the human soul--of more than one human soul. It is in this  sense that the Hiss Case is a tragedy. This is its meaning beyond the headlines, the revelations, the  shame and suffering of the people involved. But this tragedy will have been for nothing unless men  understand it rightly, and from it the world takes hope and heart to begin its own tragic struggle  with the evil that besets it from within and from without, unless it faces the fact that the world, the  whole world, is sick unto death and that, among other things, this Case has turned a finger of fierce  light into the suddenly opened and reeking body of our time.<br />In 1952, when the book was published, we were only seven years removed from WWII, in which FDR  and Churchill had allied the West to the Soviet Union in the fight against Nazism.  The great service  which Chambers provided in this book, in his journalism for TIME like the imaginative Ghosts on the  Roof (1945),  and in the Hiss Case, was--along with Winston Churchill in his Fulton, MO speech of  1946, declaring that &quot;an iron curtain has descended across the Continent&quot;--to force home the  realization that the war against Communism, though &quot;Cold,&quot; was just as much a &quot;twilight struggle&quot; as  the war against Nazism had been.  For the next four decades the West, basically the United States,  would pursue this war with various levels of determination and fecklessness, and would eventually win  it, thanks, appropriately, to Ronald Reagan, a near contemporary of Chambers, who had been inspired  by him, as reflected in that Medal of Freedom.<br />The problem for us looking back at Chambers, and it may make readers scoff a little at the heated  rhetoric of his prose in Witness, is that the West's victory looks inevitable to us now.  Several  powerful institutions--like the media, the Democratic Party, and the academy--have a vested interest in  portraying the Cold War as a battle in which everyone pitched in to help defeat an enemy which pretty  much self-destructed anyway.

S. military, though it is necessarily one of our  least democratic institutions, offers many young people a unique opportunity to realize the American  dream.  This is so because in addition to providing them with training and instilling discipline, it has,  for the most part, functioned as a meritocracy.  Which is not to suggest that it has been devoid of  politics or racism, but that in general it has been a place where a talented young man could rise  through the ranks, provided that he could tolerate the restrictive lifestyle and function within the  command structure.  This tension though--between opportunity on the one hand and the requirement  of submission on the other--makes the military a natural setting for a novel, where an author can  exploit these conflicting themes.<br />Most would probably argue that From Here to Eternity is the greatest American novel of military life  (as distinguished from novels about actual combat, like Red Badge of Courage and The Killer Angels),  indeed it made the Modern Library Top 100 and it is excellent, but The Sand Pebbles is even better  and Jake Holman is one of the quintessential heroes in all of American literature.  Jake, like his fellow  anti-heroes RP McMurphy and Cool Hand Luke, or for that matter Huckleberry Finn, is smart, likable  and a natural leader, but bristles at the many petty indignities of life.  His fierce sense of injustice got  him stuck in the Navy in the first place, in order to avoid a jail sentence for punching a spoiled rich  kid, and he has transferred from ship to ship, seeking the one with the least responsibilities and the  loosest discipline.  He's deeply ambivalent about the Navy but does love one thing about it, the chance  to work with ship's engines.  He values this opportunity for what is, significantly, a political/spiritual  reason :<br />  Machinery only cared about what a man knew and what he could do with his hands, whether he  was a coolie or an admiral, and that was the secret, very good thing about machinery.<br />And Jake's desire to be judged in this impartial and unprejudiced way carries over into his relations  with others, so that he seeks to judge them on these terms also :<br />  The coolie was an engineer; well then, he was not a coolie, he was another engineer like Jake  Holman.<br />His devotion to this simple democratic code, and his loyalty to people who measure up to its standards,  especially the coolie Po-han who he takes under his wing, makes Jake very appealing and, when added  to a thrilling adventure story set in the China of the 1920's, a society perched on the edge of  Revolution, produces one of my all-time favorite novels (and movies).<br />GRADE : A+ether he     was a coolie or an admiral, and that was the secret, very good thing about machinery.<br />And Jake's desire to be judged in this impartial and unprejudiced way carries over into his relations  with others, so that he seeks to judge them on these terms also :<br />    The coolie was an engineer; well then, he was not a coolie, he was another engineer like Jake     Holman.<br />His devotion to this simple democratic code, and his loyalty to people who measure up to its standards,  especially the coolie Po-han who he takes under his wing, makes Jake very appealing and, when added  to a thrilling adventure story set in the China of the 1920's, a society perched on the edge of  Revolution, produces one of my all-time favorite novels (and movies).<br />GRADE : A+	2001-02-08

Thus, in the 1985 New York Times review of his book Marxism,  Brigette Berger actually considered it an open question whether Sowell's negative view of Marxism  would eventually prevail, but in the very brief Times review of Quest for Cosmic Justice, Allen Boyer  dismisses Sowell's critique of egalitarianism for too often taking &quot;soft shots at easy targets.&quot;  I'm sure  that Sowell is happy to hear that his views have triumphed so completely as to no longer need  elucidation, but unfortunately a closer reading of the book reveals that many of his lessons have yet to  be learned, especially by folks like the New York Times.<br />The book is divided up into four interrelated sections, apparently based on lectures that he's been  giving throughout the years.  In the title essay he discusses the quintessential difference between the  Left and the Right : their differing views on &quot;justice.&quot;  The classical, or conservative, view of justice  has been that justice requires society to provide and enforce a fair and impartial set of rules which  treats everyone equally, but that subsequent inequalities in outcome are beyond the scope of societal  concern.  The modern, or liberal, ideal of justice--which as even been renamed &quot;social justice&quot; and  which Sowell calls &quot;cosmic justice&quot;-focuses on equality of outcomes, instead of on fairness of the  process.  Affirmative Action is the most notorious product of this ideal, with its reliance on  government intervention to pick and choose between job applicants and those seeking college  admission, based on the criteria of proportions of representation by ethnicity in the given workplace or  school.<br />It may well be, and Sowell concedes the point unnecessarily, that greater equality is a desirable social  good.  But as Sowell discusses here and in subsequent sections on &quot;The Mirage of Equality&quot; and &quot;The  Tyranny of Visions,&quot; it is beyond the capacity of government to achieve.  For one thing the imposition  of equality does not merely elevate those at the bottom of the scale; it necessarily imposes limitations  on those at the top.  Every time government favors one person it disfavors another.  In addition, it  requires government to make continual judgments and adjustments, a task for which it is ill-suited, in  order to maintain the equality of results.  As F. A. Hayek has written, these kinds of fine tuning  decisions presuppose a level of knowledge which no human nor human institution has access to.  It is  only in the free market, where information flows freely, that we even begin to approach a level of  efficient decision making.<br />One would think that by now, as Boyer suggests, this basic point would be beyond controversy.  The  massive 20th Century failures of every form of authoritarian and totalitarian government--dictatorship,  fascism, communism, theocracy, socialism--should have finally laid to rest the notion that bureaucrats  can effectively manage modern economies.  Sadly, the delusion persists.  Sowell calls the people who  cling to these visions &quot;the anointed,&quot; because what really persists is not just beliefs in certain ideologies  but the belief of certain elites that they, because of their good intentions and imagined moral purity,  should be allowed to exercise control over the rest of us :<br />  Cosmic visions of society are not just visions about society.  They are visions about those people  who hold these visions and the role of such people in society, whether these people are deemed to  be leaders of a master race, the vanguard of the proletariat, saviors of the planet, or to have some  other similarly self-flattering role as an anointed visionary group &quot;making a difference&quot; in the  unfolding of history.  Heady cosmic visions which give the sense of being one of the anointed  visionaries can hold tyrannical sway in disregard or defiance of facts.<br />Finally, in the last section, &quot;The Quiet Repeal of the American Revolution,&quot; Sowell makes the case  that the modern &quot;Quest for Cosmic Justice&quot; represents a fundamental betrayal of the nation's founding  ideals.  The American Revolution was unique in many respects, but mostly for its emphasis on &quot;laws  not men&quot; :<br />  Down through the centuries, people of the most diverse philosophic persuasions have proceeded as  if what was needed was to replace false doctrines with true doctrines and false leaders with true  leaders--the heathens with the faithful, capitalists with socialists, royalty with republicans, and so  on.  But, unlike the French revolution or the Bolshevik revolution, for example, the American  revolution and its resulting constitution did not center on a change in the cast of characters in high  places or on a change in their political language or immediate policy agenda.  Its central concern  was in establishing new processes by which whoever occupied the places of power could be  restrained and replaced.  In short, it did not pretend to have a doctrinal truth but instead implied a  deep skepticism that anyone had either a monopoly on doctrinal truth or such moral or intellectual  rectitude as to be exempt from constraints, condemnations, or dismissals from office by their fellow  men.<br />  What the American Constitution established was not simply a particular system but a process for  changing systems, practices, and leaders, together with a method of constraining whoever or  whatever was ascendant at any given time.<br />This returns us to where we began, with the conflict between process and results.  Would that it were  true that the argument was over and that the vision of process as paramount had triumphed.  But we  need look no further than the 2000 Presidential election to see that this is, sadly, not the case.<br />It has been common in the media to depict the confrontation between Al Gore and George W. Bush in  post-election Florida as simply a contest between partisans willing to adopt any position which was  politically expedient.  This assessment badly misses the mark.  The contest was really between those  who believe in the process, in the rule of law, and those who believe in the fairness of results, in  &quot;cosmic justice.&quot;  If you locked them up and administered truth serum, conservatives would admit that  they didn't care if more people intended to vote for Gore, what matters is that under the rules of the  game he lost; and liberals would acknowledge that they didn't care what the law said, they wanted the  wishes of the majority to be vindicated, and they believe that they knew those wishes.  Far from  political posturing, these views go to the very core of what it means to be a conservative or a liberal.<br />In that case, happily, the defenders of the process won, but it was a damned near run thing.  That is  why books like this one, even though Sowell does not plow any new ground and even though many of  his arguments will be familiar to many readers, are important.  He is a very persuasive and readable  writer, with a vital case to make : equality under law and equality of result are incompatible; we must  choose one or the other, and the track record of egalitarianism is so abysmal that even if its goals are  desirable in the abstract, the price to be paid in achieving them in the real world is too high.<br />GRADE : B+out those people     who hold these visions and the role of such people in society, whether these people are deemed to     be leaders of a master race, the vanguard of the proletariat, saviors of the planet, or to have some     other similarly self-flattering role as an anointed visionary group &quot;making a difference&quot; in the     unfolding of history.

Though the book is different in many respects from the better known film, at  its core it is still about the dilemmas faced by a proud black detective who is forced to help with a  murder investigation in the Deep South, and by the white police officers who are forced to confront  the disparity between their prejudices and the reality of this competent, likable fellow officer.<br />Though the main clash of characters occurs between Virgil Tibbs and Chief Gillespie--particularly in  the movie where Poitier and Steiger were the stars--in many ways the key character in the novel is  Sam Wood, the conscientious patrolman, later a suspect in the crime, who is young enough,  open-minded enough, and resentful enough of Gillespie to give Tibbs a fair shake.  More than  anything, Sam is enamored with his own role as a law enforcement officer.  He's clearly looking for a  role model and it's fascinating to watch him struggle with the idea that Virgil, though black, may be  the ideal person to emulate.<br />The racial and moral questions that animate the story help to overcome some rather stilted dialogue  and a too frequent recourse to ending scenes with a shocking cliffhanger revelation from Virgil--for  instance : &quot;You see, sir, I know it for a fact that you've got the wrong man.&quot;  Then again this was  Ball's maiden effort, and some lapses into formula are to be expected.  The book deserves to be read  and remembered for its groundbreaking presentation of an unreservedly heroic black and its salutary  message : that men should be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their  skin.  The online magazine Salon ran a column several years ago suggesting that the film version of In  the Heat of the Night might be one of the most profound movies ever made about race in America.  The book too can stand its own ground alongside other, more &quot;literary,&quot; texts like Invisible Man and  Native Son; and it's message of hope and the possibility of progress has proven it more prophetic than  its more revered rivals.<br />GRADE : A-ost profound movies ever made about race in America.

Most simply,  unanimism is the literary exploration of the life of groups as distinct from the study of the  dynamics of the individual person.  It claims for the group a special status over and beyond the  individual; the central task of the literary work is to examine and articulate the character,  personality, and particular qualities of groups of all sorts, from the transitory collectivity of human  beings who huddle under an awning during a quick shower to families and business and professional  associates who spend significant parts of their lives together in subtle patterns of proximity.  Under  Romain's leadership, unanimism flowered into something more than a cult; it became a generic  name for a religious and social discipline, for a philosophic stance, and for an interpretive art.  The  mystery of the group became the cardinal problem for the contemporary mind and it was to this  problem that Romains addressed himself.  -Maurice Natanson, Afterword to the Signet Classics edition (1961)<br />The Death of a Nobody is the first installment in what grew into a 27 volume cycle of novels, essays,  poems, and plays called Les Hommes de bonne volont&eacute; (Men of Good Will), in which Jules Romains  developed his theory of unanimism.  It concerns the death of Jacques Godard, a retired railroad  engineer, who lived by himself in a flat in Paris.  His death is depicted as an event which effects a few  acquaintances, his fellow tenants, his aged father, and a young stranger.  Romains suggests that Godard  continues to exist for a time, to the extent that these people recall him, but with the death of his  parents, is finally forgotten.  Romains uses a nearly cinematic technique, depicting various characters;'  reactions to death in narrative sequence, but as if they are occurring contemporaneously.  The novel is  interesting both for this stylistic innovation (keep in mind that when the book was written, cinema  didn't even really exist) and for the philosophy expounded, but I'd imagine after a couple of entries in  the series it would get pretty tedious.

It is indeed an old-fashioned crowd pleaser, an almost Capraesque  throwback to the great American films of the 40's.  It tells the story of four boys from a West Virginia  coal town, a company town right out of Tennessee Ernie Ford's great song Sixteen Tons.  In a football  crazed high school, none of the boys is a very good athlete.  Quentin, in fact, is a bookish nerd shunned  by the rest of his classmates.  Homer, their ringleader, decides, in the wake of the Sputnik launch, that  they will build a rocket of their own.  After some initial misfires, including demolishing his mother's  prized picket fence, and despite the initial resistance of Homer Sr., who manages and truly loves the  mine, the boys eventually enlist the aid of the whole community in their project and enjoy increasing  success even as the town dies around them.  They even determine to try and win the National Science  Fair and the attending scholarships which will offer them an opportunity to get out of town.  But their  plans are smashed when local authorities accuse them of starting a forest fire with one of their rockets  and when Homer's Dad is injured in a mine collapse, he drops out of school and goes to work in the  mine.  But that of course is not the end of it, while working in the mines, Homer teaches himself the  mathematics required to prove that the fire could not have been set by one of their launches.  Vindicated, he returns to school and goes on to win the big prize.  Along the way, he even finds time to  reconcile with his Dad.  The movie is exactly as hokey and sappy as it sounds and I loved every second  of it.<br />But as you're watching, it is awfully hard to suspend your disbelief enough to accept that this is a &quot;true&quot;  story.  There are simply too many coincidences and ironic twists, folks are just that little bit too noble,  events break a little too conveniently, until the unreality of the flow of events starts to impinge on  enjoyment of the tale.  Don't get me wrong; I still liked it, but that &quot;true story&quot; label was really  distracting.<br />At any rate, my curiosity piqued, I grabbed the book and found this epigraph:<br />  I have...taken certain liberties in the telling of the story, particularly having to do with the precise  sequence of events and who may have said what to whom.  Nevertheless, my intention in allowing  this  narrative to stray from strict nonfiction was always to illuminate more brightly the truth.  -Homer Hickman, Jr., Author's Note<br />Now, there was a time when virtually every author's first novel was understood to be a thinly veiled  autobiographical tale.  Unfortunately, our voyeuristic society seems to place a premium on &quot;reality&quot;  and so these novels have been replaced by obligatory memoirs.  These books are immediately suspect  because they so often recreate huge swathes of dialogue verbatim, often conversations which occurred  in childhood, which no one could possibly remember in such detail.  And, of course, real life is seldom  quite as interesting as fiction and events never happen as conveniently for the plot, so each succeeding  memoir relates events that seem increasingly less likely.  I mean, does anybody really think that Frank  McCourt (see Orrin's review of Angela's Ashes) got his grubstake by rolling an expired money lender?  So at this point, when these supposedly true stories have become so obviously fictionalized, why  continue this charade?<br />Hickman's book is at least honest enough to tip the reader off that &quot;liberties&quot; have been taken.  The  story that follows is great fun--a cross between How Green Was My Valley (1939)(Richard Llewellyn  1906-1983)  (Grade: A+) and The Right Stuff (1979)(Tom Wolfe 1931-)  (Grade: A+)--and is  not quite as unbelievable as the movie.  One wishes that some editor somewhere wouldhave the great  good sense and the simple honesty to call a spade a spade and acknowledge that books like this are in  fact novels.  Drop the &quot;Memoir&quot; in the title and make an honest man of the author.  Then we can just  concentrate on the tale he has to tell, which is terrific.<br />GRADE: A-ditor somewhere would have the great  good sense and the simple honesty to call a spade a spade and acknowledge that books like this are in  fact novels.

When a novelist writes from the perspective of an omniscient narrator, it at least creates the illusion  that we're hearing a full and fair version of events. But it is a peculiarity of first person narrative that  some of the very best and some of the very worst novels which use the technique leave us wondering  what the story might sound like from the perspective of a different character.  We all assume that Sam  Spade and Phil Marlowe are reliable sources on the events they relate, but even if we trust Ishmael,  don't we wonder what Ahab's version of the great novel Moby Dick might be ?  And when it comes to  a dreadful novel like Barbara Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible, one of the most noticeable flaws of the  novel is that the villain of the piece is unfairly vilified and we're left wishing he had a voice.  Several  authors have actually used this idea as a starting point, and in novels like Wide Sargasso Sea, Jack  Maggs, and Wicked, have given us alternate versions of classic stories from the perspective of a  different character (N.B., yes I'm aware that the source novels for these three are not all told in the  first person).  These derivative novels are not necessarily effective, Wicked is the only one I'd  recommend, but they do reflect a general recognition that, as in real life, even in a fictional story, the  narrative of a participant must be suspect, and that our reliance on that narrator may leave us with  mistaken impressions.  This concept resides deep within our culture: what, after all, is the New  Testament but God's recognition that Man has his own side of the story ?<br />In Dom Casmurro (which translates roughly as &quot;Lord Taciturn&quot;), the aged narrator, Bento Santiago  (or Bentinho), relates the story of his romance with Capitolina (known as Capitu), his childhood  neighbor and sweetheart, in 1850's Brazil.  For love of this girl he schemes his way out of seminary  and the priesthood, despite his mother's vow that if God would make her child healthy she would see  that he became a priest.<br />Though the breaking of this vow is troubling, and Bentinho seeks to rationalize it away, the memoir  seems essentially to be  a love story.  Bentinho and Capitu marry.  He has a successful law practice.  He's devoted to his mother throughout her life and remains great friends with Escobar, whom he met  while attending seminary.  After considerable effort, Capitu bears a son and the loving couple's lives  seem complete.  But gradually certain comments and asides begin to intimate that all is not as it  appears.<br />A darkness begins to cloud the previously sunny story.  Bentinho reveals a jealous side to his character;  at times insanely jealous.  He hints that his story is building towards a tragedy.  Finally, he even starts  to openly identify with Othello.  As this transformation proceeds, the reader begins to question the  reliability of Bentinho's narration.  In particular, thinking back on his descriptions of Capitu we  become suspicious of his motives.  He has mentioned things like her being more mature than he at the  time of their initial courtship, and several remarkable instances where she was able to deceive her  parents effortlessly, while he had great difficulty doing the same.  It becomes more and more  noticeable that Capitu, though the book becomes an indictment of her, is never allowed to defend  herself.  It's almost certainly reading too much into the novel, but I was struck by the fact that on two  occasions Capitu actually writes out words, and that they form a kind of palimpsest in which she sends  the reader a secret message : when they are first courting she scratches :<br />  BENTO  CAPITOLINA<br />on a wall; and then later, after quizzing him about his devotion to her, she crawls one word in the dirt  : liar.  Perhaps this is Machado's way of offering us just a glimpse of Capitu's defense, a coded  message that Bentinho is lying about their relationship.<br />At any rate, the novel is marvelous--sly, witty, and insidious.  Machado subverts the first person  narration and creates tantalizing, unresolvable doubts in the reader's mind.  It's no wonder that he is  considered Brazil's greatest novelist and Capitu its most beguiling heroine; like the Mona Lisa, much  lies hidden behind a masterful portrait.  If, like me before I happened to pick up a copy of this book,  you've never heard of Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, do yourself a favor and seek him out.

He spent a year at Columbia University, traveled to Mexico and Europe, moved to Harlem in 1924, finished college at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and then returned to New York, where he became one of the pivotal figures in the Harlem Renaissance.<br />His first book of poetry, The Weary Blues, was published in 1926 and he proceeded to write poetry, novels, short stories and plays that chronicled the Black experience in America for the next forty years.<br />Hughes acknowledged the particular influence of Carl Sandburg and Paul Laurence Dunbar (growing up he says &quot;almost every Negro home had a book of Dunbar poetry&quot;) on his own poetry. The other great influence on his work was Black music--Jazz, Blues and spirituals.<br />One of his best and best-known poems was written when he was just 18, on a train ride passing over the Mississippi on his way to Mexico &amp; was published in The Crisis--the official organ of the NAACP:<br />The Negro Speaks of Rivers<br />I've known rivers:  I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the  flow of human blood in human veins.<br />My soul has grown deep like the rivers.<br />I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.  I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.  I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.  I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln  went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy  bosom turn all golden in the sunset.<br />I've known rivers:  Ancient, dusky rivers.<br />My soul has grown deep like the rivers.<br />The influence of the Blues on his work is nicely captured here:<br />Po' Boy Blues<br />When I was home de  Sunshine seemed like gold.  When I was home de  Sunshine seemed like gold.  Since I come up North de  Whole damn world's turned cold.<br />I was a good boy,  Never done no wrong.  Yes, I was a good boy,  Never done no wrong,  But this world is weary  An' de road is hard an' long.<br />I fell in love with  A gal I thought was kind.  Fell in love with  A gal I thought was kind.  She made me lose ma money  An' almost lose ma mind.<br />Weary, weary,  Weary early in de morn.  Weary, weary,  Early, early in de morn.  I's so weary  I wish I'd never been born<br />The Weary Blues<br />Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,  Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,  I heard a Negro play.  Down on Lenox Avenue the other night  By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light  He did a lazy sway . . .  He did a lazy sway . . .  To the tune o' those Weary Blues.  With his ebony hands on each ivory key  He made that poor piano moan with melody.  O Blues!  Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool  He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.  Sweet Blues!  Coming from a black man's soul.  O Blues!  In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone  I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan--  &quot;Ain't got nobody in all this world,  Ain't got nobody but ma self.  I's gwine to quit ma frownin'  And put ma troubles on the shelf.&quot;<br />Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.  He played a few chords then he sang some more--  &quot;I got the Weary Blues  And I can't be satisfied.  Got the Weary Blues  And can't be satisfied--  I ain't happy no mo'  And I wish that I had died.&quot;  And far into the night he crooned that tune.  The stars went out and so did the moon.  The singer stopped playing and went to bed  While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.  He slept like a rock or a man that's dead.<br />Apparently, Hughes was criticized by some because his poetry was thought to be too frivolous, but the political nature of his writing is exemplified by the following selection:<br />Let America Be America Again<br />Let America be America again.  Let it be the dream it used to be.  Let it be the pioneer on the plain  Seeking a home where he himself is free.<br />(America never was America to me.)<br />Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed--  Let it be that great strong land of love  Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme  That any man be crushed by one above.<br />(It never was America to me.)<br />O, let my land be a land where Liberty  Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,  But opportunity is real, and life is free,  Equality is in the air we breathe.<br />(There's never been equality for me,  Nor freedom in this &quot;homeland of the free.&quot;)<br />Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark?

S. Eliot will be best remembered for the fact that a book of his poems inspired the musical Cats.  Here's a worse one : Anita Loos, author of one of the funniest novels ever written, may be remembered as the author whose book inspired the musical which inspired the music video of Madonna's Material Girl.  This after all is a book which while it was being serialized made Harper's Bazaar into a best-selling magazine, went through 45 editions in 13 languages (including Chinese and Russian) upon publication, which Edith Wharton referred to as &quot;the great American novel,&quot; which a nearly blind James Joyce chose as his preferred reading during the brief period he was allotted each day, and which won praise from readers as varied as Winston Churchill, William Faulkner, George Santayana, and Benito Mussolini.<br />Even before she wrote this story, Anita Loos had already established herself as a topflight Hollywood screenwriter, working with the likes of D. W. Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks, and she numbered H. L. Mencken among her many literary friends.  In fact, the book is at least in part intended to poke fun at Mencken.  Loos had previously noticed, with some amusement, the intellectually snobbish writer's contradictory weakness for ditzy blonde babes.  So when she found herself traveling cross country on the Santa Fe Chief with her husband (the director John Emerson), Fairbanks, several other gentlemen and one blonde starlet, she was struck by the fact that the men stumbled over themselves trying to help the other woman, while Ms Loos was left to lug her own baggage:<br />  Obviously there was some radical difference between that girl and me.  But what was it?  We were  both in the pristine years of early youth; we were about the same degree of comeliness; as to our  mental acumen, there was nothing to discuss : I was the smarter.  Then why did that girl so far  outdistance me in feminine allure?  She was a natural blonde and I was a brunette.<br />Loos promptly began writing the first notes for what would become the hilarious adventures of Lorelei Lee, the flighty but conniving blonde to whom &quot;Fate keeps on happening,&quot; and, when finished, sent them to Mencken, who was then editing The American Mercury.<br />He told her, &quot;Little girl, you're making fun of sex, and that's never been clone before in the U.S.A.,&quot; but also suggested that she submit the story to Harper's Bazaar.  The editor, Henry Sell, liked the initial story so much that he got her to write several more installments and serialized them in the magazine.  The rest, as they say, is history...<br />The resulting novel reminds me a great deal of Ring Lardner's You Know Me, Al (see Orrin's review). It is presented in the form of Lorelei's diary, so is entirely in her unique voice, with tortured syntax, creative spelling and unintentionally revealing insight.  Lorelei, like Lardner's antihero, is surpassing ignorant of culture and most of the world beyond her particular haunts, but, unlike Jack Keefe who is genuinely unenlightened about himself, she betrays a profound understanding that her looks and her general availability enable her to extract just about anything she wishes from gentlemen.  And the most important similarity is that this is just a funny book, certainly one of the funniest ever written by an American author.<br />GRADE: Arence between that girl and me.  But what was it?

The New York Times, he told me, doesn't have reporters, they have correspondents. And he just  didn't give up. He was very tenacious. He hounded me for about four or five months until I said  OK, you can have the story, provided that we have an understanding: that you will get it a little bit  at a time whenever I can. I couldn't very well tell him that at the time I was involved in a shooting  war in New York.<br />One of the stupider criticisms, amidst many legitimate ones, of George W. Bush in this 2000 Presidential campaign is that he is merely following in his Dad's footsteps; as if this was unusual?  John McCain went to the Naval Academy--his father and grandfather were admirals.  Steve Forbes runs Forbes magazine--here's a shocker for you, he wasn't the founder.  Al Gore was nicknamed Prince Albert because he was so patently aping his old man's career.  (Bradley is the exception here, thanks to the freak gift of athletic ability).

In Honor Thy Father, Gay Talese offers a fascinating real-life account of what happens when the family business turns out to be the Mafia.<br />Talese was still a beat writer for the New York Times in 1965 when he was sent to the federal courthouse in Manhattan to cover the arrest of Bill Bonanno, an intelligent, affable young mobster who had been wanted for questioning in the disappearance of his father, mob boss Joseph Bonanno.  Talese, himself of Italian descent, had long wondered what life was like for real mafiosi.  He approached Bill Bonanno, who was his own age and was college educated (though he never finished) and asked him if he would sit down for a series of interviews which would lead to a book on growing up the son of a Don.  Over the next five years, while Bonanno dealt with the disappearance and reappearance of his father, fought his way through a mob war (the Banana War) and ended up going to prison for credit card fraud, Talese gained unprecedented access to Bonanno and family and friends.

The match was historic in itself:<br />  &quot;It has been thirteen years since an American won the men's-singles final at Forest Hills, and  this match will determine whether Ashe or Graebner is to have a chance to be the first American  since Tony Trabert to win it all.  Ashe and Graebner are still amateurs, and it was imagined that  in this tournament, playing against professionals, they wouldn't have much of a chance.  But they  are here, close to the finish, playing each other.  For Graebner to look across a net and see  Ashe--and the reverse--is not in itself unusual.  They were both born in 1943, they have known  each other since they were thirteen, and they have played tournaments and exhibitions and have  practiced together in so many countries and seasons that details blur.&quot;<br />But McPhee is actually after bigger game than this one match.  He also provides insightful portraits of the two very different contestants.  Ashe, the only championship level Black tennis player of his time, is single, liberal, mercurial, a finesse player and a risk taker.  Graebner is married with kids, conservative, religious, a power player and risk averse.  McPhee demonstrates how their personalities influence, indeed shape, their play and how their lifelong rivalry lifts their games to higher levels when they play one another, ultimately lifting Ashe's game towards perfection by the end of this contest.<br />Ashe would go on to win the tournament, becoming the only amateur to win it in the Open era and together Ashe and Graebner lead the US to it's first Davis Cup in years.  After that though, while Ashe went on to a respectable career, Graebner slipped into obscurity.  But in this book, McPhee has preserved a moment in time when the two were evenly matched on the court, despite being polar opposites off of the court and in charting the lives that brought them to that moment, he provides a penetrating glance at two fascinating men.<br />This is a real pinnacle in Sports writing.<br />GRADE: Aarting the lives that brought them to that moment, he provides a penetrating glance at two fascinating men. <br />This is a real pinnacle in Sports writing.    <br />GRADE: A	2001-01-31

Washington called him the &quot;Poet Laureate of the Negro Race&quot;. Dunbar, the son of ex-slaves, grew up in Dayton, OH, where he was friendly with the Wright Brothers. He had a successful high school career--founding editor of the school paper and elected class president of the predominantly white school--but upon graduation, he was forced to work as an elevator operator. His second book of poetry was praised by William Dean Howells and by age 24, he was one of the most renowned Black literary figures in America.<br />Dunbar wrote in two different styles. On the one hand, he wrote straightforward  classic verse that was filled with racial pride:<br />  THE COLORED SOLDIERS<br />  IF the muse were mine to tempt it  And my feeble voice were strong,  If my tongue were trained to measures,  I would sing a stirring song.  I would sing a song heroic  Of those noble sons of Ham,  Of the gallant colored soldiers  Who fought for Uncle Sam!<br />  In the early days you scorned them,  And with many a flip and flout  Said &quot;These battles are the white man's,  And the whites will fight them out.&quot;  Up the hills you fought and faltered,  In the vales you strove and bled,  While your ears still heard the thunder  Of the foes' advancing tread.<br />  Then distress fell on the nation,  And the flag was drooping low;  Should the dust pollute your banner?  No! the nation shouted, No!  So when War, in savage triumph,  Spread abroad his funeral pall--  Then you called the co]ored soldiers,  And they answered to your call.<br />  And like hounds unleashed and eager  For the life blood of the prey,  Sprung they forth and bore them bravely  In the thickest of the fray.  And where'er the fight was hottest,  Where the bullets fastest fell,  There they pressed unblanched and fearless  At the very mouth of hell.<br />  Ah, they rallied to the standard  To uphold it by their might;  None were stronger in the labors,  None were braver in the fight.  From the blazing breach of Wagner  To the plains of Olustee,  They were foremost in the fight  Of the battles of the free.<br />  And at Pillow! God have mercy  On the deeds committed there,  An the souls of those poor victims  Sent to Thee without a prayer.  Let the fulness of Thy pity  O'er the hot wrought spirits sway  Of the gallant colored soldiers  Who fell fighting on that day!<br />  Yes, the Blacks enjoy their freedom,  And they won it dearly,too;  For the life blood of their thousands  Did the southern fields bedew.  In the darkness of their bondage,  In the depths of slavery's night,  Their muskets flashed the dawning,  And they fought their way to light<br />  They were comrades then and brothers,  Are they more or less to-day?  They were good to stop a bullet  And to front the fearful fray.  They were citizens and soldiers,  When rebellion raised its head;  And the traits that made them worthy,--  Ah! those virtues are not dead.<br />  They have shared your nightly vigils,  They have shared your daily toil;  And their blood with yours commingling  Has enriched the Southern soil.  They have met as fierce a foeman,  And have been as brave and true.<br />  And their deeds shall find a record  In the registry of Fame;  For their blood has cleansed completely  Every blot of Slavery's shame.<br />  So all honor and all glory  To those noble sons of Ham--  The gallant colored soldiers  Who fought for Uncle Sam!<br />WE WEAR THE MASK<br />We wear the mask that grins and lies,  It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--  This debt we pay to human guile;  With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,  And mouth with myriad subtleties.<br />Why should the world be over-wise,  In counting all our tears and sighs?  Nay, let them only see us, while  We wear the mask.<br />We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries  To thee from tortured souls arise.  We sing, but oh the clay is vile  Beneath our feet, and long the mile;  But let the world dream other-wise,  We wear the mask!<br />But on the other hand, he was a master of dialect poems:<br />AN ANTE-BELLUM SERMON.<br />WE is gathahed hyeah, my brothahs,  In dis howlin' wildaness,  Fu' to speak some words of comfo't  To each othah in distress.

Chillun, let us pray!<br />Inevitably, in a Reconstruction America that was both nostalgic and regionalist, his dialect poems were wildly popular &amp; tended to overshadow his more serious verse. As a result, he has always been a figure of some controversy in Black America; alternately dismissed for popularizing a derogatory stereotype of Blacks and hailed as a great literary figure. Dunbar captures this dichotomy in his own poem, The Poet:<br />The Poet<br />He sang of life, serenely sweet,  With , now ant then, a deeper note.  From some high peak, nigh yet remote,  He voiced the world's absorbing beat.<br />He sang of love when earth was young,  And Love, itself, was in his lays.  But ah, the world, it turned to praise  A jingle in a broken tongue.<br />Given the perspective of 100 years, it seems to me that he deserves to be read by all Americans.<br />GRADE: B+br />Why should the world be over-wise,  In counting all our tears and sighs?

He has the makings of a really first rate novelist, but for whatever reason--vanity about his ability to get away with it?, lack of confidence in the value of his work without it?, skewed perceptions?--he clutters up his work with magic and he strains for a vocabulary and an erudition that sound totally unnatural.  His National Book Award winner, Middle Passage (see Orrin's review), could have been a terrific book in the classic American nautical adventure tradition of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (see Orrin's review), Moby Dick, Billy Budd (see Orrin's review), Two Years Before the Mast, The Sea Wolf (see Orrin's review), etc..  But in mid-story he added on a storyline involving a mysterious African God and the whole thing went to heck in a handcart.  In Dreamer, he's up to the same tricks and it's a shame.<br />Johnson apparently wrote the book because he wanted to try to understand Martin Luther King as a man and a moral philosopher, absent all of the mythos that has grown up around his martyred memory as a civil rights leader.  He does an admirable job of recounting what writings and which theologians most influenced him and of presenting King, in his own words, giving sermons and speeches that develop his own philosophy.  But there is another entirely unnecessary, even destructive, plotline in the novel.  King's evil twin, Chaym Smith, appears and offers to act as his body double.  Smith is violent, profane and cynical but also widely read and deeply philosophical.  Johnson plays him off against King with Chaym taking the role of Cain and King of Abel.  this allows Johnson room for extended meditations on the Cain/Abel tale, the duality of good and evil, and so on.  Eventually, after coaching from aides, Chaym is able to pass for King at public events and even close associates can not tell the two men apart, so that on that fateful day in Memphis, we are no longer sure which one died.<br />Now, first of all, I just didn't feel that the Smith character added much to the story,  In fact, because he so often takes us away from the true Martin Luther king, he is more of a distraction, often bringing the narrative to a screeching halt.  But there's a bigger problem with this device; if you're going to use this kind of allegorical feature, you had better think through what you are saying with it.  Johnson does not appear to recognize how the comparison to Abel diminishes King.  Abel was after all a figure of virtual slavery.  He was the gatherer, living off the fat of the land, who found favor in God's eyes precisely because he lived as God intended Man to live before the Fall.  It is Cain who represents freedom and Man after the Fall, struggling to raise his own crops independent of God and being rejected by God for this very reason.  To allude to King as an Abel like figure, when he is actually one of the great freedom fighters in Man's history, seems to me to be a nearly unforgivable sin.  Moreover, the implication that King was a kind of passive, slave like creature does the man a great disservice.<br />Ultimately, Johnson has produced two books here--one good and one bad.  The sections where King is on stage are vibrant and thrilling.  They recapture some of the majesty of the man and the movement.  The portions featuring Chaym Smith are flashy, particularly as they allow him to use SAT worthy vocabulary words that trip off the tongue like boulders, but they cheapen the rest of the book.  He should have stuck to his knitting, dropped the doppelganger and ditched the dictionary.<br />GRADE: Cl, I just didn't feel that the Smith character added much to the story,  In fact, because he so often takes us away from the true Martin Luther king, he is more of a distraction, often bringing the narrative to a screeching halt.

He famously attests to feeling our pain, tears up at the drop of a hat and bites his own lip almost as often as those of the women he accosts.  No emotion, real or faked, is allowed to go unmentioned.  No facet of his life is too private to remain hidden.  He seems to be incapable of embarassment, devoid of shame, almost proud of personal scandal.  Everything--good, bad &amp; indifferent--is on display and no thought is given to how the public and his peers perceive him.  His life is about personal gratification and little else.<br />How different this is from the example of George Washington.  As Gordon Wood has written in an excellent essay in the Virginia Historical Review, to Washington reputation was of paramount importance.  Nothing mattered more to him than how he was perceived by his fellow men.  This obsession fostered in him a moral rectitude that has served to make him seem somehow less than human, as if he had become a statue before he was even dead.  But it also made him a world historical figure, a man of unquestioned greatness.  And if our modern sensibilities find something vainglorious in his vanity and we feel a certain lack of connection with him because of his seeming perfection, at least he has maintained an aura of mystery and a sterling reputation for two centuries and counting.<br />What's the point of all this?  Just that Arthur Ashe seems to me to have been the George Washington of modern sport, an accomplishment that was all the more notable at a time when his fellow atheletes were increasingly emulating Bill Clinton.  The title of this memoir is especially appropriate because throughout his entire career Ashe seemed to be imbued with a quality of personal grace.  He was always a class act, always reserved, always professional, politically active without being shrill--he simply seemed to be better balanced and more grounded than most of those he competed against.  In fact, the rap on him was that he was too self-contained and that he needed to be more outer directed in order to win tennis matches (see Orrin's review of John McPhee's Levels of the Game).  Whether being more emotionally labile is truly of benefit on the court seems open to debate, but at any rate, Ashe remained a somewhat enigmatic, enormously respected figure.<br />It therefore came as a genuine shock when he announced to the world that he had contracted AIDs.  Suddenly this most private of public men was inextricablty tied to a disease whose associations were overwhelming behavioral.  What had happened to bring Ashe into the glare of the sensational public spotlight and, in particular, how was it possible that he, of all people, came to be identified with a disease that carried with it such negative moral connotations?  This is the point where Ashe begins his moving memoir.<br />In answering these questions, he is forced to reveal himself in ways that he never had during his career.  The effect is by turns affecting and disquieting.  I understand why he felt the need to share so much with the public, if for no other reason than to protect his carefully carved reputation, but by the end of the book, when he closes with a long admonitory letter that he wrote to his daughter, I just felt that he had gone too far.  Ultimately, he has nearly done a disservice to himself by exposing so much.  His life story and his description of the way in which family, sport and God sustained and nourished him throughout that exemplary life is eminently worthwhile.  But I finished the book feeling almost like a voyuer and wishing that he'd held back a little more.

One thinks, for instance, of such writers as Thomas Paine and Alexander Hamilton at the time of the Founding, or in recent decades of Barry Goldwater's great book The Conscience of a Conservative, or William Simon's A Time for Truth.  These are all polemical works, meant to argue for political positions, which, though intensely personal, are uncluttered by personality.  They served an essential public service by addressing vital questions in a brief and readable form.  As a result, they were widely read and quite influential.<br />Today, at a time when even White House pets have bestselling memoirs, these kinds of arguments are now grafted on to autobiographical texts for no discernible reason other than to exploit the current trend in publishing.  It was with some trepidation then that I approached Ward Connerly's book, Creating Equal.  I admire him and the battle he has waged over the past decade, but I honestly expected to skim through the typically pro forma story of his life to get to the meatier sections where he would present the intellectual case against racial preference programs.  But an unexpected thing happened on the way through the boring bits; it turns out that, though much of his tale is familiar, Ward Connerly's own life experience is one of his best arguments.<br />As is common in American society, and only getting more so, Connerly comes of mixed racial stock : Black, White, and Native American.  He is &quot;Black&quot; only by the terms of the ancient and racist &quot;one drop rule&quot; and by family tradition; in reality his race defies categorization.  He did not meet his father until very late in life and, his mother having died, was raised first by an aunt and uncle, then by his grandmother.  His grandmother and uncle were the real formative influences on his character, both of them strict and demanding that he make something of himself.  His Uncle James in particular was a role model, asking only one thing of life : that people treat him like a man; in exchange always carrying himself like one.  Together they instilled in Connerly a burning desire to be judged on his own merit.<br />It thus seems natural that when, as a member of the University of California Board of Regents, Connerly was approached by a couple who had statistical evidence of the use of quotas by the UC colleges, he turned their cause into his cause.  His account of the battle for Proposition 209, the California Civil Rights Initiative, and then subsequent contests in Washington, Texas and Florida, make for interesting reading, though they are perhaps not as viscerally powerful as the story of his early life.<br />Throughout the book, Connerly is animated by a simple timeless creed which gives the book its title :<br />  I celebrated July 4 1995 with a heightened awareness of the personal freedom at the core of  nationhood.  When the Founding Fathers said that we were all created equal, they were proposing an  audacious theory that ultimately inflamed the rest of the world.  By fits and starts, Americans had  tried to make that theory into a reality, with abolitionism, the Emancipation Proclamation, and, of  course, the civil rights movement, which instituted sweeping revisions of the law that have brought  us ever closer to the fulfillment of the promise of our national life.  I felt in my heart that race  preferences--by whatever name--were not a continuation of that progress, but an obstacle in the road  to freedom and equality.  At best a diversion, and at worst a giant step backward, affirmative action  preferences caused us to lose sight of the task we inherited from the Founders--creating equal as the  only category that counts in America.<br />There's a deep irony in the fact that these beliefs, traceable to Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence and Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, should now make Ward Connerly anathema to the Democratic Party and to the institutionalized civil rights movement.  We have reached a sad point in our nation's history where to the inheritors of the legacy of Jefferson and King the idea of a color blind society has been transmuted into a weird kind of racism itself.  It should not have required courage to, as Connerly boldly does, advocate that race be ignored in awarding government jobs and contracts, but it did, and this demonstration of courage makes Connerly into a heroic figure, willing to brave epithets, threats and hatreds to vindicate his convictions.  This memoir, harkening back to The Autobiography of Ben Franklin and Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery, partakes of the great American tradition of self-reliance and the demand that each of us be judged individually; this gives it an impact all out of proportion to what I expected.<br />GRADE : As Jefferson's Declaration of Independence and Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, should now make Ward Connerly anathema to the Democratic Party and to the institutionalized civil rights movement.

2120733:US	52173832	RKMKMP8DOMCXT	0060163216	683770434	I Had a Hammer: The Hank Aaron Story	Books	5	6	6	N	N	a genuine American hero	I started following baseball when we moved to NJ in the late 60's and, serendipitously, the first season that really captured my attention was 1969.  We had a color TV (a rarity at that time--it was a big old console job with stereo &amp; turntable built-in.  You sometimes had to bang underneath the picture tube with a hammer to fix the vertical hold) and our next door neighbor Joe Koberlein would come over to watch Mets games.)  Unquestioningly loyal to our beloved Amazins, my brother and I had little doubt that Tommie Agee and Cleon Jones (both of whom happen to have come from Aaron's hometown of Mobile, AL) were the two best outfielders in baseball, maybe the two best ever.  Our Father, who had doggedly remained a Dodger fan despite their move West, would put in a word for Duke Snider.  We lived in Yankee country, so Mickey Mantle still had his backers and their were those residual Giants fans who stumped for Willie Mays--who also won allegiance from many black fans on racial solidarity grounds.  But I really don't ever remember a Hank Aaron fan.  Sure we knew he was good, especially during the NLCS were we reminded of how dangerous he was, but he just wasn't terribly glamorous or personable and he played for a team that noone rooted for, so to our minds he was barely worthy of notice.  The, seemingly all of a sudden, we realized the guy was about to catch Babe Ruth.  I remember NBC breaking into their regular programming to show his 715th HR live.  Then began the arguments over just how good he was; arguments that always seemed to have a whiff of race about them.  In the ensuing years this argument has hardly died down and the racial overtones have certainly not faded.  In fact, the subtle assertion that the only reason you would deny Aaron primacy is that you are a closet racist has added an additional layer of bitterness to his legacy.  All of this combined with Aaron's own demeanor, whether he is aloof or shy or whatever, has always led me to view him somewhat askance.  There's that visceral level on which I just can't grant him equality with Ruth, let alone with the more personable Mays.<br />So it came as a great surprise and a pleasure when this book was published, to find in its pages a Hank Aaron who was not only a great baseball player but a compelling hero and human being.  Beyond simply providing a complex portrait of a gifted and proud human being, the book serves to provide some context for the pure numbers that Aaron put up in his career and, more importantly, reminds us of the backdrop of persistent racism against which these feats were achieved.  We all find things easier to comprehend if they follow an easy narrative form, so when we say that Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier it is easy for us to misperceive this as meaning that racism in baseball ended in the late 40's.  And Aaron, because he was so good for so long, seems to us a figure of the 60's, or even the 70's.  But the book reminds us that Hank Aaron began in the Negro Leagues (with the Indianapolis Clowns), played in minor leagues which had only just lowered the color bar, had to stay in separate hotels and eat at different restaurants on road trips, etc.  And still, some thirty years later, as he approached the Babe's HR mark, received virulent hate mail.  Aaron's incredible career takes on a patina of real grace when considered against this pervasive and corrosive pattern of racial animus.  His accomplishments, monumental in themselves, must be judged as singular when taken in conjunction with the unique challenges he faced.<br />If I were picking my all-time team today, I'd still take Ruth and Mays over Aaron (Aaron vs. Ted Williams is a tougher call.)  But if you were trying to judge them all as men, I think this book makes a compelling case that Aaron is one of the really great men in the history of sports and even one of the great men in our nation's history.  A lot of people have been yammering about the stupid things that John Rocker said in Sports Illustrated, but when I read Aaron's comments that he found them unacceptable, I was struck by how much more moral authority he brought to the question.  So many of the great men of the Civil Rights era are gone--Jackie Robinson, Martin Luther King, etc.--it is important to recognize that one remains, and he just happens to have been a great hitter too.<br />GRADE: Acker said in Sports Illustrated, but when I read Aaron's comments that he found them unacceptable, I was struck by how much more moral authority he brought to the question.

Angelou's prose, as one would expect, is often poetic and she looks back at her early life with little of the anger and hatred which so marred Richard Wright's Black Boy (see Orrin's review).  That said, let me also say that I agree with the school boards that have banned the book from libraries and classrooms.  The scenes where, as a child, she is sexually accosted by one of her mother's friends are too disturbing for young readers; heck, it was too disturbing for me.  But more importantly, the book ends with her triumphantly getting herself with child, though still a teen.  I can think of no message more inappropriate for young readers.  Let them wait and read the book in a couple years, it will still be around and they will have developed a fuller and more appropriate personal context in which to judge it.<br />GRADE: B	2001-01-31

After all, if you're a sufficiently important figure, there will be no shortage of biographies--it seems that half the historians in America are currently working on Lincoln books--but what you hope for is a book that is a sufficient artistic achievement that it will become a must read.  That way, the subject's life story almost covertly stays in the public eye, while the audience is reading the book for its literary qualities. Such, for instance, is the case with Boswell's Life of Johnson where, but for the seminal nature of this work, Samuel Johnson, pithy quotes and all, would be a virtual unknown today.<br />Jackie Robinson's story is of course so well known to most of us today that such a text hardly seems necessary to preserve his place in history.  But sadly, even many professional baseball players have little idea of what he achieved and it is so intrinsic to the American national character to sort of purge bad memories (like that of the color line which barred blacks from playing major league baseball) that it is easy to imagine that the memory of his accomplishments will diminish rapidly in the coming years.  It would therefore be nice to have a biography of him that would be read compulsively by succeeding generations of Americans and kids in particular in the same way that we all tore through the novels of John R. Tunis (see Orrin's review) and Mark Harris (see Orrin's review) and the very fine Robert Creamer biographies of Babe Ruth (Babe : The Legend Comes to Life) and Casey Stengel (Stengel : His Life and Times), both interesting characters, but certainly less significant historical figures than Robinson.<br />Arnold Rampersad, who co-wrote Arthur Ashe's moving memoir Days of Grace (see Orrin's review), has produced a functional and authoritative life of Jackie Robinson, but it does not reach the heights one would have hoped.  Indeed, it almost seems as if he found Robinson's story so compelling, which it is, that he tried to stay out of the way of it and let the events speak for themselves.  Thus, while he remains an impartial presenter, perhaps even admirably so, the book ultimately seems a little lifeless.  The best aspect of the book is that it recaptures the totality of Robinson's life--from the influence of his remarkable mother to his early confrontations with racism like his Court Martial and, after baseball, to his groundbreaking career in business and his involvement in politics, both Democrat and Republican politics.  And Robinson is truly a figure of such moral courage and surpassing dignity that the mere facts of his life do make for a worthwhile and edifying story.<br />This is not a bad book, in fact it's quite good.  It just isn't vital.  If you're familiar with the basics of the story, you won't learn all that much and the writing is not of the quality to make it required reading.  I had the strange feeling while I was reading it, that this was an adult version of the sports biographies we all read as kids (I particularly remember Tom Seaver and the New York Mets).  It's okay as far as it goes; it just doesn't seem to go far enough.<br />GRADE: B+(see Orrin's review), has produced a functional and authoritative life of Jackie Robinson, but it does not reach the heights one would have hoped.

As one can see from Irving Howe's 1952 review the book's shortcomings have been obvious since it was first published, but that same review makes clear the struggle of the white establishment to treat it honestly.

I believe John Kennedy Toole's very funny, but badly flawed, Confederacy of Dunces, to  be an instance where this happened.  For anyone not familiar with the circumstances surrounding the  book, Toole's mother, Thelma, pestered Walker Percy until he consented to read her dead son's &quot;great&quot;  novel.  Percy, to his great surprise, found the huge manuscript, which was presented to him on badly  smeared carbon paper, compulsively readable.  As it turned out, Toole had committed suicide in 1969,  and his frustration at his inability to get the book published may have been a contributing factor; at  least, such a supposition makes for an even better story.  Percy helped to get the book published, by  the Louisiana State University Press, and it went on to become a surprise best seller and won a  posthumous, by 12 years, Pulitzer Prize.<br />The novel tells the story of thirty year old Ignatius J. Reilly of New Orleans, an eccentric medievalist,  living at home with his mother, whom he torments, and of his one man war against modernity.  Ignatius, who is an undeniably original comic creation, is a hugely fat bundle of body functions,  paranoia and obsessions, topped with a green hunting cap, who spends all of his considerable free time  eating, attending movies, and locked in his disgusting room committing his various demented thoughts  to his stacks of Big Chief writing tablets.<br />The story opens with Ignatius being arrested by the hapless Patrolman Mancuso, an arrest which soon  goes awry and sends Ignatius and his mother in search of liquid comfort, which they find at the Night  of Joy bar.  While Mrs. Reilly tipples, Ignatius regales her and various dumbfounded listeners with the  story of his ill-fated trip to Baton Rouge aboard a Greyhound Scenicruiser for a job interview, a trip  which was apparently so traumatic that it has kept him from working ever since.  But later that night  Mrs. Reilly backs into another car and in order to pay for the damages Ignatius is forced to seek work.<br />The misanthrope, turned loose on the work a day world, proceeds to do hilarious damage to various  employers, coworkers and customers, while using his experiences as the basis for a memoir titled : The  Journal of a Working Boy, or, Up from Sloth.  His misadventures at Levy Pants are particularly  funny, as he sends abusive letters to clients and tries leading a revolt by the firm's largely black  workforce, marching beneath a banner, actually one of his badly stained bedsheets, declaring the  &quot;Crusade for Moorish Dignity.&quot;<br />From there he goes on to a job as a hot dog vendor, an attempt to found a new political party, and all  the while carries out bitter vendettas against his mother, Patrolman Mancuso, and Myrna Minkoff, a  supposed girlfriend from college.  All of this is quite funny, but at the same time it's fairly easy to see  why it was not considered publishable.  In the first place it is much too long and loses its focus as it  goes along, before rallying at the end.  Secondly, Ignatius, though amusing, is just too far over the top  to command our sympathies.  His fascination with body functions and his erotic dreams of a departed  pet collie are less shocking now, when even Disney movies are filled with fart jokes, than they were  twenty and thirty years ago, but it still gets to be a little much.  Lastly, and most importantly, Ignatius  is so screwed up himself, and his various screeds are so contradictory, that his general opposition to the  modern age, which could have served as a badly needed unifying theme for the whole novel, and have  given it some intellectual heft, ends up being pretty incoherent and hypocritical.<br />A great novel might well have been made out of these raw materials, had Toole lived and a good  editor gotten ahold of him.  But we'll never know.  What we have instead is a very amusing,  sometimes even laugh-out-loud-funny book, which adds up to less than the sum of its parts.  The  tragic fact that a talented author killed himself before he could make the changes necessary to turn this  into a first rate novel should neither diminish, nor make us overstate, what he did achieve.<br />GRADE : Bneeded unifying theme for the whole novel, and have  given it some intellectual heft, ends up being pretty incoherent and hypocritical.<br />A great novel might well have been made out of these raw materials, had Toole lived and a good  editor gotten ahold of him.

The relationship between China and the United States is extraordinarily complex, seemingly made up  of equal parts hope, racism, &amp; misunderstanding.  The hope is a product of over a century's worth of  Protestant missionaries trying to bring the Good Word to an enormous population of potential converts  and of millions of Chinese immigrants finding economic opportunity here in the States.  The racism  too flows both ways, with each nation's people believing the other's to be barbarians.  The mutual  misunderstanding comes from myriad sources, but probably has its greatest impetus in the most  fundamental difference between the two cultures, the difference which paradoxically serves as the  main attractant and repellent between the two : American openness and Chinese reserve.  In a sense,  what each values in the other is what it has least of itself.  The image of the &quot;Ugly American,&quot; though  partly a caricature,  is also fair to the extent that it's a product of our inability to keep our opinions,  ideas, and feelings to ourselves.  Meanwhile, the competing image of the &quot;inscrutable Oriental,&quot;  though freighted with racist overtones, reflects American inability to understand people who don't  &quot;share&quot; as much of themselves as we do.  It's easy to see then that two peoples who are so different  would find each other intriguing.  Daughter of China plumbs these themes, both on a personal and a  political level, and, though a little uneven, serves as a valuable look at one Chinese woman's  confrontation with East and West.<br />Meihong Xu was raised in the rural village of Lishi.  A devoted Maoist from an early age, even to the  point of allowing political suspicions to color her perceptions of her father and a devoted Aunt, she  joined the People's Liberation Army in 1981 and was chosen to become one of the &quot;twelve pandas,&quot; a  dozen young women selected for an elite intelligence unit and sent for special training at the  prestigious Institute for International Relations in Nanjing.  Once there however, she became a disciple  of an at least mildly  pro-Western officer, known as &quot;the Coffee General&quot; for his Western ways,  including a preference for coffee over tea.  He hoped to open an institute which would immerse  trainees in American culture and so Meihong was sent in 1988 to the Center for Chinese and American  Studies, a joint venture of Johns Hopkins and Nanjing University.  There, in addition to her studies,  she was asked by a friend in the Ministry of State Security to keep an eye on Larry Engelmann, an  American instructor they suspected of spying.<br />In accordance with her assignment she cultivated a relationship with Engelmann, but soon found him  too naive and trusting too conceivably be an intelligence operative.  Moreover, his innocence, good  humor and emotional openness was so appealing to her that she found herself becoming enamored with  him.  Engelmann, for his part, lonely, unhappy, and thousands of miles from home, fell in love with  her.  But their nascent relationship was abruptly ended when Chinese Intelligence ordered Engelmann  out of the country and arrested and interrogated Xu, apparently motivated in large part by the desire of  certain elements within the government to use her to get at the Coffee General and other pro-West  officials.  Xu ended up being expelled from the PLA and sent back to her village, to work as a  peasant.  But she eventually got word to Engelmann in the States and the remainder of the book details  their efforts to get her out of China.<br />Though the story is billed a romance, there's an awkward unreality to the relationship between Xu and  Engelmann, who seem at times to be in love with the idea of each other more than with the actual  person.  But the political portrait of modern China more than makes up for any weaknesses in the love  angle.  Meihong Xu's journey from committed daughter of the revolution to doubt-filledyoung adult  to San Jose, California makes for really compelling reading.  One of the most unfortunate aspects of  the American-Chinese relationship, and this I think is mostly a product of latent racism,  is that we in  the West do not take seriously the mass murder, repression, and aggression of China's Communist  government.  We are all too willing to minimize their crimes, or excuse them altogether, as an  unfortunate byproduct of an understandable nationalist reaction to decades of Western imperialism.<br />It would be better for all concerned, but especially for the people of China, if we in the West  understood the reality of life there better.  The best way to develop this understanding is for a dissident  literary tradition to emerge, as it did in the Soviet Union.  This has begun to happen with books like  this one, the works of Anchee Min (other than the unfortunate Becoming Madame Mao), and other  authors like Ha Jin.  Most significantly, Philip Short's great recent biography of Mao goes a long way  to revising the largely benign view of him, and the recently released Tiananmen Papers may prove a  turning point similar to the publication of Solzhenitsyn's devastating Gulag Archipelago.<br />The ultimate value of this book then lies not in its love story, which is charming enough though  ultimately not terribly compelling (to anyone but the participants); it lies instead in its revelatory  portrait of one young woman's experiences in Red China, a nightmare world no less repressive and  monstrous than the USSR.  In this regard it is invaluable and I recommend it to anyone who still  harbors the belief that Maoist China has been qualitatively different from any of the old Iron Curtain  regimes.<br />GRADE : Bed young adult  to San Jose, California makes for really compelling reading.

Here he seeks to reclaim the reputation of the most  underrated and misunderstood, again successfully.  Though he won a spot on the $10 bill, Alexander  Hamilton--because he favored a strong federal government--has traditionally been portrayed as some  kind of enemy of democracy.  The fact that his main political opponent was Thomas Jefferson, the  darling of the Left, has led to much ill treatment by historians.  And his untimely demise at the hands  of Aaron Burr has tended to link him in our minds with that least worthy of men.  In this short but  sufficient biography, Brookhiser demonstrates the surprising degree to which Hamilton was  responsible for creating and shaping the American nation, both through the force of his ideas and, at  the vital moment, by getting the United States' financial house in order.<br />Like many of the Founders, Hamilton's own talents and the extraordinary events of the day allowed or  required him to prove himself adept in a variety of endeavors.  In addition to being perhaps the only  leader of any influence to really understand economics, Hamilton was a successful lawyer and soldier.  But the real revelation, and considering the Federalist Papers it should not be, is how influential he  was as a writer.  His sheer output was voluminous, and he both addressed all of the important issues of  the day, and actually convinced people to change their minds--whether advocating that the Constitution  be adopted, that the Federal government assume pre-existing debt, or that an industrial economy was  better suited to improving the lot of most citizens than an agrarian economy (Report on Manufactures).<br />Because Madison is a co-author of the Federalists, and was the main author of the Constitution itself,  he has tended to overshadow Hamilton.  But Brookhiser makes a strong case for Hamilton being the  more influential advocate.  He also makes the case that Madison was something of a chameleon, taking  on the coloration of those around him, and that the Constitution's delicate system of balances might  have been much different had Hamilton not presented and argued for his more powerful and  centralized federal plan.  This would certainly explain why Hamilton became such an impassioned  defender of the Constitution that Madison drafted, that it represented an even handed attempt to meet  Hamilton's concerns.<br />The most heart breaking of Hamilton's writings is his explanation of his affair with Maria Reynolds.  When Hamilton realized that she and her husband were running an elaborate badger game he ended the  affair, but it was later publicized by his enemies.  In a move of remarkable candor, Hamilton  published a brutally frank pamphlet which laid bare his role in the whole sordid mess but defended  himself from false charges of corruption.  Though the romance is a black mark on his record, his  handling of it redounds to his credit.<br />The Reynolds Affair is only one of several points where this two century old story intersects with or  casts light on current affairs.  Here's Brookhiser discussing Burr :<br />  [A]n old man who had met an old Aaron Burr when he was young was asked about Burr's 'rare  attraction,' and said it came from 'his manner of listening.  He seemed...to find so much more  meaning in your words than you had intended; no flattery was more subtle.'  Listening is a virtue of  the judicious and the compassionate.  But narcissists also do it surpassingly well.  We associate  Narcissus with beauty and self-regard, but the key to his myth is that it is about surfaces.  Narcissus  was captivated by his reflection because that was all he had.  Narcissists must live through their  interactions, because there is no one home.  Burr's charm, attentiveness, and promiscuity; his ability  to get schemes going, and his failure to follow them through; his lack of principle--all flow from  his character.  He was like a new refrigerator--bright, cold, and empty.<br />It is frightening how easily Bill Clinton's name can be substituted for Burr's in that savvy assessment.<br />In the end, Hamilton's greatest contribution may have been in the realm of financial affairs.

He certainly had a clearer vision of the future than his more celebrated rival Thomas  Jefferson, whose fetishistic love of the land led him to countenance slavery, which Hamilton opposed.  Beyond theory, it was Hamilton's concrete achievements as the first Secretary of the  Treasury--founding the first National Bank, accepting responsibility for Colonial debt, and installing  tariffs to provide a steady source of Federal revenues--that put the young nation on a sturdy financial  footing and make him one of the greatest Cabinet Secretaries of all time.<br />Hamilton's too short life was so event filled and Brookhiser is such a good writer that the book seems  almost too brief.  But wanting more is a pretty paltry criticism and the book is an invaluable corrective  to our woefully inadequate understanding of Hamilton's service to the country and his character as a  man.  At one point Brookhiser sums up the reason why Hamilton is not as well regarded as some of his  peers :<br />  There are three modes of leadership.  The highest is inspiration: rare, sometimes false, but  impossible to live without.  Next is demonstration--honestly sharing all your reasons with all  comers; explaining where they come from, and where they lead.  Lowest is flattery, which either  fools both the leader and his followers, or fools no one, but is indulged because followers and  leaders are too tired to think of anything else.  Hamilton seldom rose to the highest level, and would  not sink to the lowest.  His greatest rivals, such as Jefferson, inhabited all three, especially the first  and the third; hence their success.<br />This is nicely stated and is just one example of the author's really penetrating insight into his subject.

I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and  be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may  comfort me for any thing.&quot;<br />  Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &quot;Ah! my dear, I wish you would  not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make  any more matches.&quot;<br />  &quot;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the  greatest amusement in the world!&quot;  -Jane Austen, Emma<br />The edition of Emma that I just finished has a lovely portrait of a young woman on the cover painted  by Josef Stieler.  So as a coworker walked by my desk she asked : Are you reading a chick book !?<br />I quickly protested it was not a chick book--one has one's pride after all--but the cover and her  question raise the question : why is it not a chick book ?  Why are the novels of Jane Austen, dealing  as they do with the machinations of English gentry of marriageable age and their convoluted  courtships, so popular among all readers ?  We well understand why she should have been a favorite of  Henry James, but why did Winston Churchill continually reread her also ?  These questions are  directly related to another which plagues modern arguments over Jane Austen : do her novels have  political ramifications ?  The answers to all these questions are to be found in Emma, which is my  favorite of her novels.<br />At the outset let me admit that this only became clear to me when watching the terrific movie Clueless,  which is based on this novel, but I now believe Emma to be one of the greatest political novels ever  written.  Austen predicted of Emma Woodhouse : &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom no one but  myself will much like.&quot;  She was quite wrong; Emma is exactly the kind of misguided busybody with  a heart of gold for whom, unfortunately, we have trouble nursing much dislike.  The plot of the tale is  presumably too well known to need much rehashing here : suffice it to say that Emma is a pleasant and  well-intentioned young woman who fancies herself a matchmaker, having successfully joined her  governess and Mr. Weston, and so proceeds to meddle in the romantic lives of those around her despite  eschewing the idea of marriage for herself.  In particular, she takes Harriet Smith, a pretty young girl  of dubious social station, under her wing and tries finding her a husband.  There follow the expected  misunderstandings and hurt feelings before true love finally outs and Emma realizes that not only did  she not know what was best for others, in fact she did not understand her own heart's desires.<br />Now, at first blush that may not sound all that political, but the fundamental point Ms Austen conveys  is actually not dissimilar to the argument of the great political philosopher F. A. Hayek in The Road to  Serfdom (read Orrin's review).  Hayek's devastating critique of the modern state and centrally  controlled economies argued that no government bureaucrat could ever effectively make decisions for  other people because it is impossible to process all of the information that goes into other people's  decision-making.  Only the free market, which allows for the greatest flow of information that humans  have thus far devised, can even begin to approach the levels of efficiency that a complex economy  requires to function smoothly.  Likewise, Jane Austen, over a hundred years earlier, warned us of the  unsatisfactory results to expect when one person sought to make decisions for others, even when acting  with their best interests at heart.  There will always be those among us, like Emma or like Hilary  Clinton, who wish to manipulate our lives (always, we are assured, for our benefit ratherthan for the  joy they take in the exercise), but the results are seldom salutary and never what the manipulators  intended.<br />The idea of poor Jane Austen having to hide her writing when a family member entered the room and  confined to the novel of manners is nearly totemic to feminists.  They decry the system of oppression  which restrained her talents to insignificant topics and sentenced her to writing about romance.  In  reality, Austen, at least in Emma, demonstrates that simple human wisdom knows no bounds and is as  likely to be found in a comedy of manners as in any scholarly journal.  In its own way Emma is as  stern a rebuke to centralization and authoritarianism as can be found in the Western Canon.  That her  books are wonderfully witty and evoke images of an inviting pastoral past is merely icing on the cake.<br />GRADE : A+ays, we are assured, for our benefit rather than for the  joy they take in the exercise), but the results are seldom salutary and never what the manipulators  intended.<br />The idea of poor Jane Austen having to hide her writing when a family member entered the room and  confined to the novel of manners is nearly totemic to feminists.

Nor was my fear allayed by this defensive sentence in the Introduction :<br />  I do not mean to suggest that fast food is solely responsible for every social problem now haunting  the United States.<br />Disclaimers like that one usually indicate the opposite of what they say.  But just a few sentences later  comes a surprising admission which sets the tone for the whole book :<br />  During the two years spent researching this book, I ate an enormous amount of fast food.  Most of  it tasted pretty good.  This is one of the main reasons people buy fast food; it has been carefully  designed to taste good.  It's also inexpensive and convenient.<br />This is merely the first of many times throughout the book where Schlosser's fairness and honesty  compel him to reveal facts that tend to undercut the polemical thrust of his arguments.  This  willingness to present both sides of the issues, combined with his prodigious research on the industry,  makes for a book that, though the author clearly has a viewpoint that he wants to get across, also  allows readers to make up their own minds, and provides the information necessary to make informed  decisions.  Though I disagreed with many of Schlosser's arguments, it was really refreshing to find an  author who acknowledges competing views.<br />Here are some of the instances in which this contradictory dynamic crops up.  One of the topics that he  spends a good deal of time on is the pay levels in the industry, both for those who actually work in  restaurants and for those who produce and process the food.  He makes a big issue of the attempt by  restaraunteurs to hold employees to minimum wage and not give them benefits, but at the same time  he acknowledges that most of the workforce is made up of teenagers and :<br />  Although some students...work at fast food restaurants to help their families, most of the kids take  jobs after school in order to have a car.<br />Now, I'd acknowledge that a labor force of fathers trying to support their families on minimum wage  would represent a social problem, but I won't shed a tear over teens who want their own cars.  Not to  mention that he goes on to note that :<br />  Most of the high school students I met liked working at fast food restaurants.<br />To quote the immortal Clara Peller : Where's the beef ?<br />Similarly, in a section on the unskilled, uneducated migrant workers who are being &quot;exploited&quot; by the  meat packers, Schlosser notes that they get something like $10 an hour, whereas the average worker in  Mexico and Central America, where many of these employees come from, makes $5 a day.  Sure, it  would be wonderful if these folks were getting rich working at the undeniably difficult and often  dangerous jobs they perform, but, comparatively, they are getting a damn good deal right now.<br />In the scariest portion of the book, he details all of the potentially lethal microbes that have invaded  the food supply, e. coli and the like.  He goes to great lengths to show how inadequate the system is  for inspecting meat and testing for these contaminants, and I'll accept every word he says.  But he also  concedes that when meat is cooked properly these microbes are killed and then points out that food  irradiation will also destroy them and is safe, but that misunderstanding of the process and  fearmongering has kept it from being widely adopted.  Sounds like there are safe and simple solutions  to even this most worrisome of issues.<br />Finally, in the least compelling portion of the book, he argues that fast food is bad because it's making  us fat.  No one can honestly take issue with his point that the fat content in fast food is ridiculously  high, and that the enormity of portions is unnecessary.  However, in arguing that fat consumption is a  unique problem, he accidentally concedes one of the great achievements of the industry :<br />  During thousands of years marked by food scarcity, human beings developed efficient  physiological mechanisms to store energy as fat.  Until recently, societies rarely enjoyed an  overabundance of cheap food.<br />Okay, so there are some problems associated with an &quot;overabundance of cheap food:&quot; the whole world  should face such problems.  Moreover, assuming that you believe in evolution, shouldn't we expect  this to be a temporary problem, one that will take care of itself as succeeding generations develop  mechanisms which don't store fat ?<br />Perhaps the best effect of Schlosser's honesty is that when it comes time to make proposals for solving  some of the problems he's raised, he's pretty reasonable.  The best point he makes is that :<br />  Nobody in the United States is forced to buy fast food.  The first step toward meaningful change is  by far the easiest: stop buying it.<br />I don't believe that his book makes the case that such a step is necessary.  It does, however, enable the  reader to better understand what goes on behind the scenes to get that Big Mac or Whopper into your  hands.  As he presents it, this information is always fascinating and it is often at least troublesome.  The book is well worth reading even if you don't ultimately end up feeling compelled to boycott the  Colonel.<br />GRADE : B+accidentally concedes one of the great achievements of the industry :<br />    During thousands of years marked by food scarcity, human beings developed efficient     physiological mechanisms to store energy as fat.

Initially resistant to their overtures, Learoyd eventually joins them in  what quickly deteriorates into an incredibly brutal guerilla war, with disastrous consequences for  himself and his newfound people.<br />Borrowing elements from Bridge on the River Kwai, Joseph Conrad, The Man Who Would Be King,  and Shakespeare, the Academy Award winning photojournalist Pierre Schoendoerffer, crafts a brisk,  violent meditation on the insanity of war and the futility of Western colonial pretensions :<br />  '...To devote one's life to...No, I mean to let oneself be possessed by another race is sheer  delusion...It's selling one's soul to the devil.  A renegade.  There's no greater curse than being a  renegade...Being a deserter, perhaps ? The devil can't be reckoned with.  One fine day you have to  betray one or the other of them.'<br />In the fighting that follows, Learoyd, who the Muruts say is &quot;...afflicted of God,&quot; must indeed choose  between the needs of the Allies and those of his followers and the British officers must make choices  between Learoyd, who has served them well, and the demands of the Dutch who want their colony  pacified.  It all makes for an exciting mixture of combat, sacrifice and betrayal, with overtones of  tragedy thrown in.  If it doesn't quite measure up to all of the author's ambitions, it's still well worth  reading.<br />GRADE : B	2001-01-22

Smiling, he murmured softly.<br />  &quot;Just remember, man.  Wherever you go and whatever you do.  Always play a real cool hand.&quot;  -Cool Hand Luke<br />  Cool Hand Luke is narrated by Sailor, much of it as he overhears it from Clarence &quot;Dragline&quot; Slidell,  as the road crew is resting in a churchyard, a yard which they consider &quot;sacred ground&quot; because it is  where Dragline and Luke were finally captured..  Together their gospel recalls how Lloyd &quot;Cool Hand  Luke&quot; Jackson came to be among them.  His crime, like Christ chasing the moneylenders from the  Temple, was cutting the heads off of municipal parking meters.  Sentenced to serve on the chain gang  at Raiford prison, he is put to work on what the convicts call the &quot;Hard Road,&quot; his own Via Dolorosa.  The men are watched over by a group of brutal bosses, the most fearsome of whom is Boss Godfrey,  with his reflective sunglasses which make him inscrutable.<br />Though not a particularly large man, Luke is a war hero, excellent musician, sharp card player,  extraordinary worker and incredible eater.  All of these add to his legend, but it is his indomitability  that raises him to mythic status.  In the most symbol rich scene in the novel, Luke bets that he can eat  50 hard-boiled eggs in one hour.  Fifty four are prepared for the event, and by no coincidence that  happens to be the number of men serving on the chain gang.  Luke of course succeeds in the effort,  several of his acolytes finishing off the remaining eggs.<br />After Luke's mother dies, the warden has him put in &quot;the box,&quot; just in case he gets any ideas about  escaping.  Luke responds to this unjust punishment by taking off as so as he can (on the 4th of July,  naturally) and the remainder of the novel details his series of escapes and subtle and large defiances of  authority.  Throughout, the other convicts live vicariously through his courage and his demonstration  of will.  Though unwilling to resist the bosses themselves, they take inspiration from his example.  In  their most powerful moment of resistance, they follow Luke's lead on a Friday afternoon as he prods  them on to finish a particularly difficult stretch of roadwork ahead of schedule.<br />Finally, he becomes too great a challenge to the authority of the bosses and they determine to break  him through a series of sentences to the box and brutal beatings, leading to the predictable but still  affecting moment :<br />  With a final blow, Luke's head was flung forward.  He hung there by the arms, limp, sagging, held  up by the trustees who turned their faces with sickened grimaces, unable to look at him, unable to  look at each other.  And we stood there staring up at Cool Hand's body that was crucified against  the sky, his bleeding head bowed toward us.<br />  Behind him stood Boss Godfrey, his black hat outlined on the cloudy heavens beyond, his mirrored  glasses catching the full rays of the sun and reflecting them down upon us, the eyes of the Walking  Boss becoming two balls of blinding celestial fire.<br />And in the end they do indeed make him despair :<br />  Don't hit me no more, Boss! Please! Don't hit me no more!  I'll do whatever you say.  Just don't hit  me no more.<br />  The music stopped.  Boss Paul smiled.  The faintest trace of a grin moved at the corners of Boss  Godfrey's lips.  Bending over, he spoke quietly, anxiously, almost with tender concern.<br />  Have you got your mind right, Luke?<br />  Yes sir, Boss.  I got it right.  I got it right.<br />  Are you sure, Luke?  You ain't gonna backslide on me are yuh?  You sure your mind's right?<br />  Yes suh, Boss.  Please.  Please don't hit me no more.<br />  All right Luke.  All right.  Ah won't hit you no more.<br />  The Building was silent.<br />But this is not the end of Luke, any more than Christ's cry of &quot;Oh Lord, why hast thou forsaken me!&quot;  was the end of Him.  Luke escapes one lasttime, and though it is the last, even after he's gone his life,  his defiance of authority, and his passion for freedom serve as the examples that the men aspire  towards.  Just as Luke took on the burden of their souls and their sins in the eating of the eggs, in their  stories, if nowhere else, he has achieved Everlasting Life.<br />GRADE : A+!&quot;  was the end of Him.

In a sense it brings the story full circle, because in the original novel  Auster used the conventions of the private eye story to explore the issues implicit in film noir :  identity, fate, good and evil, randomness, etc.  Since many of the great hard boiled dicks first appeared  in pulp fiction, it seems only natural to have this most modern (or post-modern) riff on the genre end  up back in comic book form, however glorified.<br />Actually, Auster himself indulges in so many games with language, shifting identities and allusions to  other works that the comic book format is especially well suited to his playfulness.  And, like William  Goldman's Princess Bride, that sense of fun serves to lighten what can often be most ponderous in  post-modern literature, the way in which its practitioners act as if their metafictional techniques are  revolutionary and profound.  This work is such a throwback that it unabashedly wears its antecedents  on its sleeve; never mind the obvious nod to mysteries of the 30's and 40's, it even goes so far as to  discuss Cervantes and his metafictional innovations in Don Quijote.<br />I tend to doubt that Paul Auster's brand of existential musings will appeal to all tastes and I'm sure  some will simply find the idea of reading a comic book to be beyond the pale.  But if you're an Auster  fan, a private eye or noir enthusiast, or just haven't outgrown comics generally, it's well worth tracking  down a copy.  I realize it says more about me than I should be comfortable revealing, but I actually  think the best part of the book is the section on the criminally insane Professor Stillman's religious  theses--they're frighteningly close to my own views and make for quite compelling speculation, adding  to what is already a fun and unusual reading experience.<br />GRADE : A	2001-01-17

Forget the underlying philosophy of man's helplessness, there's just something viscerally thrilling about  watching someone go down in flames.  But then, on reflection, you come back to the same old  objections, chief among them : that man is not doomed; that free will exists; and that individuals  determine their own fates.<br />Paul Auster manages here to provide a compulsively readable thriller, wherein we experience that  moment where surrender makes sense, and then to pull back from that brink and restore some measure  of free will.  Along the way he hurls around enough allusions, references and parallels to keep a  battalion of academics scribbling away for years as to what it all means.  I'm afraid to even hazard a  guess--let me just say that I was especially struck by the Biblical and Sisyphiphean themes, but noticed  the Huck Finn nature which Michiko Kakutani talks about in her NY Times review, and am perfectly  willing to accept both her Waiting for Godot comparison and the Freemasonry angle that one reviewer has come up with.  Though brief, it's a densely textured work, great fun to read and to  contemplate afterwards.  Though I find its ultimate elusiveness to be frustrating, I'm sure others will  find it especially gratifying for precisely the same quality.<br />GRADE : A-	2001-01-16

Add in the fact, repeated in the  novel, though apparently true, that after being turned away by French publishers, the author pretended  to be only the translator of the novel, and that it was then published, and you've got a book that can't  possibly live up to the hype that precedes it.<br />Makine, who fled the Soviet Union in 1987 when he was thirty, tells the semi-autobiographical tale of  a young man who, along with his sister, spends summers in Siberia with his French grandmother,  Charlotte Lemonnier.  Trapped there after the death of her Russian husband, Charlotte shares a world  of memory with the children, memory of France prior to WWII.  In the intensely paranoid world of  Soviet Communism, Charlotte's very Frenchness is deeply suspicious to her neighbors and the  authorities.<br />The boy grows up loving his grandmother and the idyllic world she summons, but torn between this  Francophilia and a youngster's need to conform and embrace his Russian side.  In his mind, the Russian  aspect of his character comes to represent a kind of barbarism and a capacity for brutality, while the  French aspect represents a gauzy humanism and a love of beauty.  It is this sense that shows him that it  is right for the Soviets to fear their Frenchness :<br />  I became aware of a disconcerting truth: to harbor this distant past within oneself, to let one's soul  live in this legendary Atlantis, was not guiltless.  No, it was well and truly a challenge, a  provocation in the eyes of those who lived in the present.<br />Here in the West, it is blithely assumed that humanism and the good reside exclusively in the souls of  progressives.  For Makine, and his narrator, precisely the opposite is true; in the East, at that time, it  was necessary to look backwards to find values and a culture which exalted human being, while the  progressives of the Soviet Union did all they could to extinguish them.<br />Memory is so personal that it's not too surprising that Makine's narrative sometimes seems overly  diffuse and obscure.  He lays on the Proust and Nabokov parallels a tad too heavily at times--a few less  references to cork-lined rooms and moths wouldn't hurt; we get the message.  And I'm sufficiently  Francophobic to find it amusing, rather than touching, that someone recalls France with such a golden  glow.  But the lyricism of the writing, some memorable images, and the way the story implicates the  tragedy of 20th Century Russia earn the book a qualified recommendation.<br />GRADE : C+true; in the East, at that time, it  was necessary to look backwards to find values and a culture which exalted human being, while the  progressives of the Soviet Union did all they could to extinguish them.<br />Memory is so personal that it's not too surprising that Makine's narrative sometimes seems overly   diffuse and obscure.

There were several different types of  writers in that group, the infamously long essays were turned out by folks like Joseph Mitchell and  Berton Roueche (my two favorites), while shorter pieces, drawings, poems, etc., were the province of  Thurber, Robert Benchley, E. B. White and several other polymaths.  Considering the range of his  duties, that he was writing for a weekly magazine, and the length of his career (the pieces in this  collection span a period from 1929 to 1961), you could probably fill numerous volumes with  Thurber's work and indeed there are plenty of collections of his varied output available, many  published during his life but many others posthumous.<br />Though he would not be considered a crime writer, this book happens to be organized around the topic  of crime, and that serves to give it a thematic coherence that a random anthology would lack.  Included are drawings, stories, and articles that cover a whole range of topics, fiction and nonfiction.  Plenty of folks only look at the cartoons in The New Yorker, and if you enjoy that style of humor,  you'll enjoy Thurber's drawings.  His artwork borders on the amateurish--and since he eventually went  blind, it got worse as he went along--but it's certainly distinctive.<br />Most all of the stories are written with the wry wit for which Thurber was best known--in his  Introduction, Donald E. Westlake calls it &quot;gentle comedy.&quot;  There's an especially good true tale about  an employee who stole tens of thousands of dollars from Harold Ross, the magazine's publisher, before  being caught.  Though ostensibly an attempt to understand the thief, who ended up committing  suicide, Thurber turns it into an opportunity to poke fun at Ross.<br />But far and away the best thing in the book, and one of the best stories I've ever read, is &quot;The Macbeth  Murder Mystery.&quot;  An American woman visiting an English hotel accidentally grabs The Tragedy of  Macbeth instead of one of the cheap mysteries she intended.  Undaunted, she simply reads the play as a  whodunit, and to the narrator's astonishment, decides that the Macbeths are not guilty.  Her  explanations, full of perfectly rational references to the traditions and conventions of the detective  genre, eventually ensnare the narrator and the reader, and when, by the end of the story, he's offered  his own solution to the mystery and is ready to take on Hamlet, we too are carried away by the  demented logic of the tale.<br />The book's worth reading for that story alone; the rest is gravy.<br />GRADE : B+poke fun at Ross.<br />But far and away the best thing in the book, and one of the best stories I've ever read, is &quot;The Macbeth  Murder Mystery.&quot;  An American woman visiting an English hotel accidentally grabs The Tragedy of  Macbeth instead of one of the cheap mysteries she intended.

Framed by the funerals of  Winston Churchill and Princess Di, the book argues that the greatness of Britain has passed, subsumed  in the familiar morass of statism, political correctness, and egalitarianism.  After listening to his  lament, Brian Lamb asked him what one thing about that now departed Britain he would most like to  bring back; Hitchens answer : &quot;Mainly civility...&quot;  Now, much of the conservative yearning for the  past must be taken with a grain of salt--no one, or very few, think the world was actually a better  place fifty years ago, with Jim Crow laws and the like--but on this one point conservatives clearly  have a case for the superiority of the past : nothing good has come of the coarsening of society.  The  complete abandonment of manners and etiquette has been an unmitigated disaster.<br />The argument against civility and manners is that they represent an artificial facade; and we after all  live in an age when you're supposed to &quot;act naturally,&quot; &quot;be yourself,&quot; &quot;let it all hang out,&quot; etc., ad  nauseum.  In the first place, the serious and determined cultivation of civility ( a la George  Washington) can serve to shape the underlying person : careful tending to the facade can result in the  edifice coming to resemble its front.  Second, even if public behavior based on strict etiquette is a  front, it is favorable to the alternative : better to be treated decently by someone who loathes you than  to be treated in a manner that coincides with their true feelings.  Which brings us to the final point,  having seen what we're all really like without our masks of civility on, does anyone really want their  fellow man to keep on letting it all hang out ?  While everyone is  busy &quot;being themselves,&quot; we've  come to the sad realization that we don't much like those selves.  Which is not to say that we would  liked those selves any better fifty years ago, but, thankfully, fifty years ago those selves weren't on  display, instead everyone presented an admittedly artificial, but blessedly good mannered self to the  world.<br />Come we now to Kazuo Ishiguro's justly praised novel, The Remains of the Day.  In the character of  Mr. Stevens, a nearly perfect English butler, Ishiguro created one of the most memorable and  sympathetic figures in all of fiction.  As Stevens drives his new American employer's car across the  countryside, on his way to visit a former housekeeper, Miss Kenton, whom he hopes to lure back top  work at Darlington Hall, he reflects on his years of service to Lord Darlington and his own rather  complicated relationship with Miss Kenton.  Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that Lord  Darlington was a leading light in the movement to appease Hitler prior to WWII, and that, though  neither ever managed to articulate their feelings, Stevens and Miss Kenton were very likely in love  with one another, though she eventually left to marry another former staffer.  Eventually, as our  modern sensibilities seem to require, Stevens comes to understand that he has made a series of  dubious, perhaps even tragic, choices, and that both his service to Darlington and his failure to woo  Miss Kenton have resulted in his wasting his life.<br />That at least is the intended lesson we are to draw from the story.  But lurking within this rather  flaccid moral is an ever greater tragedy, one which makes Stevens one of the truly great heroes of  Western literature, until his rather maudlin closing scenes make him seem pathetic.  The more  intriguing reading of the story is that Stevens--with his unyielding professionalism, his ethic of  service, and his personal reserve--represents all that was best about the society that has passed.  Like  Don Quijote, he stubbornly adheres to a code which the rest of the world has forsaken, and like  Quijote, his idealism, though easily caricatured, is more appealing than the real world that he refuses  to accede to.<br />Ishiguro stacks the deck against this interpretation in two particular ways.  First, he makes Darlington  and the &quot;appeasers&quot; into pure tools of the Nazis and casts them as a tiny band of wholly deluded  aberrations.  In fact, appeasement, so-called, was extraordinarily popular at the time.  It was actually  those few in favor of War, like Winston Churchill, who were the social outcasts and were considered  outside the mainstream of political thought.  It is instructive that William Manchester's very good  book on Churchill during these years is called, simply : Alone.  For all that Ishiguro treats Neville  Chamberlain like a member of a clandestine cabal, bent on foisting a secret appeasement on Britain, it  is well to remember that he was hailed as a hero when he returned from Munich having secured  &quot;peace in our time.&quot;  when a democratic leader achieves the will of the overwhelming majority of the  people, he may be said to have acted unwisely, but he can hardly be said to have acted beyond the  bounds of reason.<br />Nor is it as self evident as some would like that the appeasers were wrong, even in retrospect, if we  consider only British national interests.  There is no likelihood that the Nazis ever could have  conquered Britain, nor that they could have long held it had they succeeded.  The War, though it  ultimately ended with Nazi Germany defeated, devastated Britain.  The civilization for which  Winston Churchill fought did not long survive him, which inevitably raises the question of whether it  was a  worthwhile fight.<br />Ishiguro counts on our willfully blind remembrance of the War, which has been glorified into a  popular and noble struggle against the Holocaust and its perpetrators, to make Darlington seem more  ridiculous than the events of the day or subsequent history would indicate him to be.  The intent is of  course to cast a pall over Stevens's service to the man, by debasing the cause he served, but this is  manifestly unfair.  Moreover, it raises an unfortunate analogy between fascism and the English  pre-War culture, such that Darlington's service to the Nazis is akin to Steven's service to Darlington,  as if the two are intertwined.  This is ludicrous.<br />There were, of course, British fascists.  And anti-Semitism was prevalent and virulent, though not as  virulent as in continental Europe.  But to portray Darlington as a genuine fascist or anti-Semite would  make him so abhorrent that Steven's loyalty to him would not be at all sympathetic.  But the demands  of the novel should not have led Ishiguro to completely rewrite history.  We are ignorant enough of  our own history without the popular culture further clouding it.<br />As for Miss Kenton, here to Ishiguro tries to have it both ways.  She is only slightly less reserved  than Stevens--after all, it's not as if she ever comes right out and tells him how she feels either.  But  at the same time, he has her flee, rather than work things out.  And they would work out eventually :  even proper English butlers married and had kids, witness Stevens's own father.  Perhaps their reserve  would have made the process agonizingly slow, but we have no doubt it would eventually have  happened and, in the meantime, their relationship, though stilted, had always seemed one of immense  rewards and real affection, however frustrating at times.<br />At novel's end, it's hard not to feel that it was Miss Kenton who made the mistake by leaving, rather  than Stevens by not stopping her.  A Stevens who was capable of the type of emotional openness for  which Miss Stevens seems to be pleading, and which Ishiguro apparently thinks healthy, would not  even be the same person with whom both she and we have fallen in love.  This is the odd paradox of  the novel : Ishiguro has crafted this character who readers love, but is suggesting that he should be  someone else entirely.<br />Though the author intends us to see tragedy in Stevens inability to change, it is far easier to perceive  tragedy in the way the surrounding world did change.  The world of Churchill and Darlington and  Stevens has been, as Peter Hitchens says, abolished.  In its stead stands the Britain of Tony Blair and  Charles and Camilla and Elton John.

It's tempting to surmise that men's interest in body image, and their relatively recent concerns about  physical attractiveness, along with sexualization of the male body, means they are becoming  feminized.  This, however, is decidedly not the case.  Looking good is part of a quintessential male  strategy whose ultimate aim is to make men more successful, competitive, and powerful.  The  means of achieving this goal may be new, but the objective is not.<br />  Millions of American men have been transformed into body-conscious consumers of revealing  fashions, seductive perfumes, and the services of hairstylists, personal trainers, and plastic  surgeons.  Due credit for this transformation must be given to advertisers, marketers, and  self-esteem gurus, who have sold men--and all of us--a message of self-transfiguration through  self-commodification.  The traditional image of women as sexual objects has simply been expanded:  everyone has become an object to be seen.  -Lynne Luciano, Introduction to Looking Good<br />Though Lynne Luciano's look at male body image would be perfectly adequate as a long magazine  article, maybe one of those forty page jobs in The New Yorker, it feels like it's stretched pretty thin as  a book.  Perhaps this is because one key element is missing : analysis and conclusions.  The basic  premise, as stated above, is intriguing, if arguable.  The reportage, on trends in exercise, diet, hair loss  remedies, cosmetic surgery, and sexual dysfunction treatments, over the past five decades, is excellent.  She suggests a number of factors which have led men to be more concerned about how they look,  some of which are fairly obvious--the Sexual Revolution, Youth Culture--but some of which are more  subtle and interesting : later marriage and multiple marriages mean that men are on mating display  long after their prime, whereas in the past they had only needed to look good between the ages of 15  and 21, when nature took care of most of the problem; loss of exclusive control over economic assets  means that many men, just as women in the past, need to look appealing for more financially well-off  mates.  What's sorely missing though is a defense of the thesis, some discussion of what it all means,  and some proposals for how to counteract these trends which clearly seem malignant.<br />As a threshold matter, it is not necessarily clear that the premise of the book is accurate.  It may well  be that this is simply one more instance where the massive and aberrant Baby Boom generation, by  dint of sheer numbers and vocality, has warped societal perceptions, making it seem that their unique  pathologies signal the coming of a new day.  The defining characteristic of the Boomers has been their  total and exclusive fascination with themselves.  At each step along their march through life, they've  wielded sufficient numbers and power to get whatever serves them best, but have always cast their  demands as societal imperatives.  Thus, when they were young, we got sexual revolution and drug  culture, but they became parents and all of a sudden we were back to &quot;Just Say No,&quot; and safe sex.  When they were old enough to go to go to Vietnam, war became immoral.  Sure enough, they got us  out of that war, but for all their talk of changing the world, they seemed unfazed by Desert Storm.  They abandoned their president, Bill Clinton, when he wanted them to pay for Universal Health Care,  but now they are retiring and, mirabile dictu, it's time for a Universal Prescription Drug plan.  And  so on, and so forth.  At any rate, they've made a fetish out of their youth, back in those halcyon 60's,  and most of the trends in physical obsession that the author talks about may well just be attempts by  this unique, unfortunately influential, cohort to cling to the illusion of youth for a few extra years.<br />A plausible argument can even be made that this cultural moment has already passed.  Things like hair  plugs andViagra are relatively passive responses to aging, and are easily undertaken, but the type of  exertion required to maintain a youthful physique is quite difficult.  It would be shocking if many  older men were actually able to maintain the weight levels, muscle tone, and stamina of truly younger  men.  Nor is there any evidence that they are doing so : America is notoriously becoming an obese  nation.  The response, at least in recent years, has not noticeably been for older men to exercise more,  rather it has been for our archetypal males to get fatter : Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Newt Gingrich, Drew  Carey, John Goodman, Hank Hill, and that guy on the King of Queens are just a few examples.  And  the alternatives to this body type are not typically your masculine males--the Arnold Schwarzenegger  and Sly Stallone of twenty years ago--instead there are the nerds, like Bill Gates and Ken Starr, or the  androgynous, like Tom Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio.  It seems likely that as the Boomers are losing  their battle with aging and the beltline, they are demanding icons who resemble themselves, which is  after all easier than trying to make yourself look like some Madison Avenue version of the ideal male.<br />As for what it all means, to the extent that the process of objectification of the male body is going on,  the focus on the physical shell rather than the inner being is easily explained as part of the broader and  quite pernicious cultural trend towards extreme egalitarianism.  Given enough hair treatment, cosmetic  surgery, steroids, and exercise, you could pretty much make the entire population look the same.  Hell,  if Michael Jackson can turn himself into a Caucasian, what can't you do with technology ?  Just wait  until we can really manipulate DNA and you may have a planet that's half Antonio Banderas and half  Jennifer Lopez.  The problem, and the inherent flaw in egalitarianism, is that this inexorable grinding  of the population towards a mean does not actually produce anything worthwhile in the people  themselves.  One day you wake up with a whole planet full of people who look exactly the same, think  the same, achieve the same, and all you've got is a huge mass of mediocrity.  The time men, and  women, are wasting on making themselves &quot;beautiful&quot; could better be put to use improving their  character and their minds.  A society that invests so much of its time, money and effort in pure  externalities and ignores the soul, must surely be headed for trouble.<br />As for proposals, here are two :<br />  *  Do not provide any health insurance coverage for any cosmetic processes or for drugs which  target physique or sexual function.  Make folks pay for all this crap and it will quickly fall out  of favor.<br />  *  Strengthen the institution of marriage and make divorce more difficult.  Marry one person and  grow old, bald and fat together.<br />That should be enough to get us started on the road back to normalcy.

A resident of Acapulco, Mexico, who  wrote in English,  he carefully clouded the issue of his real background, so that for many years he was  believed to be one Berick Traven Torsvan, from Chicago, IL, and some even believed him to be  Ambrose Bierce.  It is still not possible to say with certainty who he actually was, but the best  available evidence indicates that he was Ret Marut, a revolutionary anarchist who fled from Germany  in the wake of the failure of the post-WWI revolution.  This supposition at least has the advantage of  squaring with the radical-Left political tenor of his novels, the most famous of which is Treasure of  the Sierra Madre.<br />This is one of those books which has become inseparable from its better known movie version--it's  probably impossible to read the story without picturing Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston.  As  anyone whose ever seen the movie (which hopefully means everyone) will know, Dobbs is a  down-at-the-heels American looking for work in the Mexican oil fields.  He and Curtin, another  roustabout, have idle dreams of getting rich quick, but it's not until they join up with the aged gold  prospector Howard that they actually head into the Sierra Madre mountain range to find their fortune.  It is Howard who enunciates Traven's political message and forecasts the plot of the tale :<br />  [G]old is a very devilish sort of thing, believe me, boys.  In the first place, it changes your  character entirely.  When you have it your soul is no longer the same as it was before.  No getting  away from that.  You may have so much piled up that you can't carry it away; but, bet your blessed  paradise, the more you have, the more you want to add, to make it just that much more.  Like  sitting at roulette.  Just one more turn.  So it goes on and on and on.  You cease to distinguish  between right and wrong.  You can no longer see clearly what is good and what is bad.  You lose  your judgment.  That's what it is.<br />Perhaps this too argues for Traven's Germanic origins, for sure enough, they do find gold, and within  short order the men are acting like creatures out of the Brothers Grimm or the Ring of the Nibelungen,  with predictably horrific and tragic results.<br />Traven's point here, though grounded in everything from Genesis to Teutonic myth to Marxism, is  ridiculously utopian.  It is not gold (or materialism generally) that makes men act like animals; filthy  lucre is merely one more thing to fight over; but food, land, mates, beliefs, skin color, language, etc.,  serve equally well to make men lose their judgment.  In this sense, the novel is horribly dated,  obviously a product of a time before we'd seen just how evil socialism would turn out and the degree  to which right and wrong would cease to be distinguishable to the practitioners of the anti-materialist  ethos.<br />On the other hand, the awesome power which Traven confers upon gold, to corrupt the human soul,  and the harkening back to ancient myth, somehow serve to give the novel a quality of timelessness.  Read simply as a meditation on greed, it's hard to see how Traven's core message could ever be out of  date.  There's a whole lot of Dobbs in all of us; let's try to avoid his fate, eh?<br />GRADE : B+hat is bad.  You lose     your judgment.

Both the basic story  and the religious philosophy are exciting, and though generations of readers have complained that the  final chapter is too difficult to follow, the Annotated version has explanatory essays by Martin Gardner  and there's an excellent essay of his available online, which do a great job of explaining just what  Chesterton is up to.

Of course, what's bizarre about this is that the novel,  from its very beginnings in Cervantes' Don Quijote--in Part II of which, Cervantes refers to people  having read Part I--has often utilized these techniques; when you get right down to it, there's really  nothing modern about at least this one aspect of modernism.<br />However, the use of these techniques, even if they are nothing new, has certainly become much more  pervasive over the past century.  Nowhere is this more evident than in children's entertainment.  In  everything from the old &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; on the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show to the televisions  in the bellies of the Teletubbies, the culture assumes that even kids are prepared for self referrential  irony and are alert to the wholly fictitious nature of the stories they are being told.<br />This trend received perhaps its ultimate expression in William Goldman's very funny novel, The  Princess Bride, and the fine movie based on it.  Think of how many layers removed from &quot;reality&quot; you  are by the time you get to the film, which is after all based on a book by William Goldman which  ostensibly abridges a classic tale by S. Morgenstern, which Goldman's father used to read him; the  abridgment having been made necessary by Goldman's discovery that his father significantly abridged  Morgenstern's story himself, so as to make it more enjoyable for the boy.  Suppose for just a moment  that some genuine occurrences inspired some &quot;original&quot; story, by this time we're awfully distant from  them, aren't we ?  There can't be many folks who actually need further authorial tricks and devices to  clue them in to the fact that we're in the realm of fiction.<br />But here at last we stumble on the key ingredient that makes The Princess Bride such a success :  Goldman isn't so much trying to alert the reader (viewer) that the story is fiction, instead he's trying to  convince us that it's real, or at least that there is an S. Morgenstern and an original version.  He wants  us to appreciate, even to love, Morgenstern and his Princess Bride in the same way that he did as a  boy, at least fictionally or at least books like this one that the real William Goldman recalls from his  real childhood.  And this is the little-understood secret to any effective parody/satire/what-have-you :  before the irreverence begins, you have to approach the source material with reverence.  It's just not  very funny to make fun of something that no one takes seriously in the first place (which perhaps  explains why comedy is so completely the province of conservatism and why liberals have no sense of  humor--taking everything seriously but reverencing nothing, they find no amusement in irreverence).  Princess Bride is so funny precisely because Goldman has been so careful to follow the conventions of  the fairy tale and because he's obviously thought them through so thoroughly.  Thus, for all the fun he  has at the expense of the genre, in the end the good guys win, the bad guys are dead or vanquished,  true love has been vindicated, and we all fondly recall having our father or grandfather read to us.<br />Thankfully, there is now a hardcover version of The Princess Bride--for a long time you could only  find the paperback movie tie-in--and you can get a copy to read to your kids and your grandkids.  There's some kind of cosmic irony in a send-up of classic children's literature becoming a classic itself,  an irony which probably galls the modernist apostles of irony--which is all the more reason to enjoy  the story, which, even without this additional inducement, is an awful lot of fun.<br />GRADE : Ad of cosmic irony in a send-up of classic children's literature becoming a classic itself,  an irony which probably galls the modernist apostles of irony--which is all the more reason to enjoy  the story, which, even without this additional inducement, is an awful lot of fun.<br />GRADE : A	2001-01-04

Both will be with us until our  women bear nothing but hangs.<br />  It was through the Declaration of Independence that we Americans acknowledged the ETERNAL  EQUALITY of man. For by it we abolished a cut-and-dried aristocracy. We had seen little mere  artificially held up in high places, and great men artificially held down in low places, and our own  justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence to human nature. Therefore, we decreed that every man  should thenceforth have equal liberty to find his own level. By this very decree we acknowledged  and gave freedom to true aristocracy, saying, &quot;Let the best man win, whoever he is.&quot; Let the best  man win! That is America's word. That is true democracy.  And true democracy and true  aristocracy are one and the same thing. If anybody cannot see this, so much the worse for his  eyesight.  -Owen Wister, The Virginian<br />A friend of Theodore Roosevelt, to whom he dedicated this novel, Owen Wister is considered the  father of the Western.  The Virginian has been filmed at least five times and was voted the greatest  Western of all time.  Even if you've never read the book or seen one of the movies, you're more than  likely familiar with the one great line : &quot;When you call me that, smile!&quot;<br />All of that said, it has not worn as well as some other classic novels.  It's influence, particularly in  establishing the idea of a code of the West, is undeniable, but it just doesn't read all that smoothly.  It  suffers from several significant flaws : the romance which occupies the center of the novel is both too  reserved and too idealized; the author uses a woefully awkward dialect to render the Virginian's  speech; and is affected by a too delicate sensibility about the rough justice that is meted out.  This last  may well be the product of some Eastern embarrassment over the still wild nature of the West, but it is  also a wee bit dandified.  There's a very amusing review at Amazon which claims that this is an  unacknowledged gay classic.  I don't know that I'd go that far, but I take the reviewer's point that the  true love in the book is between the narrator and the Virginian, and that the schoolmarm is mostly  annoying.  Likewise, the narrator betrays a certain squeamishness throughout which at least borders on  the effete.<br />It's still a book worth reading, if for no other reason than that it spawned one of the most popular  genres in all of literature and the movies.  There are also several asides in which Wister delineates the  rough moral code which would become so familiar in the many Westerns to follow.  But the  prospective reader should be prepared for a novel which is showing every year of its age.<br />GRADE : B-eted out.

There are however, a few of us who  are casual fans of the series and also experienced readers of Movie and TV tie-ins--one of my favorite  books as a kid was a Rat Patrol novelization--and for us it is entirely adequate, though not much more.<br />The plot involves those dreaded Cybernauts who cropped up several times during the series and  manages to involve not just John Steed and Mrs. Peel, but all of Steed's other partners too : Cathy Gale;  Tara King; and Dr. David Keel.  You really couldn't ask for much more; except for a great story.  And  here's a dirty little secret that all of us TV fans don't like to dwell on : great stories are awfully rare in  the world of television.  We become fans of a series because we like the characters and are willing to  spend an hour (or a half hour) with them every week.  But let's face it, most episodes of any TV series  are pretty pedestrian, often downright feeble.  Heck, I was a huge fan of Cheers and Magnum, P.I., but  those shows had entire seasons that were just awful.<br />So if you look back on The Avengers with misty watercolor memories, let me warn you, you're going  to be disappointed by this book.  And if you're someone who never watched the show and couldn't  figure out why someone would make the recent movie version, this book is not for you either.  But if  you recall the show as a pleasant diversion, and nothing more, this book is at least as good as a  mediocre episode of the series--except of course that it doesn't have Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg or  Honor Blackman, to get your fix of them you'll just have to buy the DVDs that are now available of  the original shows.<br />GRADE : C	2001-01-03

Clarke submitted a short story, The Sentinel, to a BBC contest;  which he did not  win.  However, the story was published in the Avon Science Fiction and Fantasy Reader in 1951, and  in 1964 he returned to the story and began expanding it into a novel.  He and the filmmaker Stanley  Kubrick used this as the basis for a movie script which, in 1968, became 2001 : A Space Odyssey; for  which both received Oscar nominations.<br />Especially considering the opacity for which the movie is notorious, the story is remarkably spare and  straightforward.  The narrator, a lunar geologist, recalls cooking sausage one morning at a research  base on the Moon, when the rising sun revealed a metallic glimmer on the rock wall of Mare Crisium.  He and a compatriot climbed the crater rim and found :<br />  [A] roughly pyramidal structure, twice as high as a man, that was set in the rock like a gigantic,  many-faceted jewel.<br />Though they initially believed it to be a relic of a lost lunar civilization (notice it is much different  than the black obelisks which were eventually used in the movie), they soon realized that it must have  been placed there billions of years ago by an advanced race from another planet.  It took twenty years,  but finally they were able to penetrate a protective shield around the crystal by using atomic upon it.  Now they understand the structure to have been a kind of sentinel, waiting to alert the beings who  placed it there that finally the human race has achieved a sufficient level of development to be worthy  of their notice.<br />I particularly like the way that this tale, written by a renowned futurist at the dawn of the space age,  actually resonates with age old religious concerns.  The simple idea at its core is that it is by increasing  our knowledge and developing our technological prowess that we will become superior beings, even  gods.  The geologist sagely worries, as must anyone who recalls the Fall of Man and the Tower of  Babel, that the beings who left behind this early warning signal may even be jealous of our advances  and may not be all that happy to find that they finally have company.  Like all of the best tales of the  fantastic, The Sentinel, though ostensibly about the future, illuminates the very mundane concerns  we've always had about the nature of our being and our role in the order of things.<br />GRADE : ATower of  Babel, that the beings who left behind this early warning signal may even be jealous of our advances  and may not be all that happy to find that they finally have company.

Bierce was a journalist/author and a Civil War veteran.  In 1913, after the breakup of  his marriage and the death of his sons, he set out for Mexico to meet Pancho Villa and observe the  Mexican Revolution at first hand.  He wrote to a friend:<br />  Goodbye, if you hear of my being stood up against a Mexican stone wall and shot to rags, please  know that I think it a pretty good way to depart this life.  It beats old age, disease, or falling down  the cellar stairs.  To be a Gringo in Mexico--ah, that is euthanasia!<br />With that, he disappeared into Mexico and was never heard from again, fueling wild speculation about  his fate (i.e., Carols Fuentes' novel The Old Gringo).  A fitting end for an author whose works  combined a bleak view of life with elements of mystery.<br />Bierce's Civil War stories are bleak little tales of death and destruction.  There's one here that nicely  captures his cynical world view--most of us saw a film version of it in grade school--An Occurrence at  Owl Creek Bridge.  Peyton Farquhar is a Southern planter captured behind Union lines on a spy  mission.  As the story opens, he stands upon Owl Creek Bridge with a noose around his neck thinking  of the wife and children he will never see again.  But when the Union soldiers try to hang him, the  noose slips and he swims off downstream.  He flees across country until he finally reaches home and as  he approaches his open armed wife...the rope snaps tight and we realize that he had imagined the  whole episode on his way down.  Here in one tidy package is the brutality of war, the futility of life  and the bitter wit that characterizes his work.<br />He's not for all tastes, and I'm not generally big on short stories, but I like him.<br />GRADE:  B	2000-12-29

Later, while living in  Princeton, NJ, he was struck by the pride residents took in the local connection to Revolutionary War  history, specifically, Washington's triumph over the Hessians. The result of these two happy  coincidences is this terrific historical novel.<br />The subtitle of the book is: &quot;A novel of the American Revolution told in the stirring words of an  enemy who was also a good soldier.&quot;  I doubt that description can be improved upon.  Drawing on  actual events and characters, Graves' Sergeant Lamb narrates the Fusiliers role in events up to the  British defeat and the capture of his unit at Saratoga.  Lamb is a wise and witty observer, as well as a  professional soldier.  His running critique of the Colonists and the obstacles they faced, particularly the  difficulties presented by the rag tag nature of the Continental Army, only serve to deepen our sense of  wonder at what they accomplished.  And Lamb serves to remind us of the fundamental decency and  professionalism of the British soldiers.<br />GRADE: B+	2000-12-29

Grace and Beatrice Foods, which alleged that TCE  (trichloroethylene) dumping at sites owned by the companies contaminated two town wells and caused  leukemia in local children.<br />The entire nation has spent the past decade gripped by one blockbuster case after another (OJ, the  Nanny, Monicagate) and having read hundreds of cases in Law School &amp; dozens of legal thrillers &amp;  watched numerous trials on Court TV, I can confidently state that the legal system is a unique  generator of human drama. There are always good guys and bad guys, victims &amp; perpetrators, oddball lawyers, brilliant jurists, arcane legal machinations, big bucks prizes or maybe a death sentence, and so  on. So what A Civil Action cried out for was something to separate it from the pack. Why should this  one case interest us?  What lessons can it teach?<br />Sadly, Jonathan Harr does not step up to the plate &amp; accept this challenge. He has provided an  excellent narrative of the events in a complex case, filled with human drama, but he conspicuously  fails to put it all in context. Here are some of the issues he should have analyzed:<br />1) The Big Enchilada: should the case ever have been allowed to go forward in the first place?<br />Let me just start by saying that the behavior of the corporations in Woburn was reprehensible &amp; they  should be subject to criminal &amp; civil prosecution for dumping &amp; for attempting to cover up their  dumping. However, the case that Schlichtmann &amp; Co. brought alleged that the dumping had  specifically caused leukemia.<br />As Dan Kennedy, a journalist who has written extensively about the case &amp; been quite sympathetic to  the plaintiffs, said in a 1998 story for the Boston Phoenix: &quot;The scientific state of the art was (and still  is) probably too primitive to allow him to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Beatrice and  Grace were at least partly responsible for contaminating Wells G and H, and that the contaminants, in  turn, caused leukemia and other illnesses.&quot;<br />Or, as renowned quack-science debunker Michael Fumento stated in Forbes: &quot;In 1982, when  Schlichtmann sued Grace, information on the solvent TCE was relatively sketchy. Now we have the results of numerous rodent studies in which the animals were dosed with thousands of times  the amount of chemical that humans might receive in their drinking water. Of the 35 rodent studies in  the Carcinogenic Potency Database developed by U.C. Berkeley biologist Lois Swirsky Gold, none has  found a TCE-leukemia connection.&quot;<br />In light of the impossibility of establishing a link between TCE and the leukemia cases, it seems  obvious that Judge Skinner should have granted the Rule 11 motion that Beatrice Foods brought &amp;  should have sanctioned Schlichtmann for bringing a frivolous suit.<br />This case was simply not the appropriate vehicle for punishing Grace &amp; Beatrice &amp; vindicating justice.<br />2) Is a jury capable of dealing with the technical issues raised in such a case &amp; is it appropriate to have  a jury deal with the emotional issues raised?<br />The section of the book on the jury deliberations was especially troubling.  The level of confusion  displayed throughout the trial by even expert witnesses raises the question whether anyone actually  understood what was going on, but the jury clearly had no idea what they were supposed to be doing  &amp; ended up rendering a thoroughly confusing verdict in the first stage of the trial.  If civil cases this  complex are to be brought to trial, which they surely will be, it seems that it would make more sense  to have them be bench trials or to appoint Special Masters with the technical background to decide the  fact issues.<br />Luckily we were spared the spectacle of the second portion of the trial, where Schlichtmann would  have paraded &quot;victims&quot; before the jury in an attempt to win a big money judgment. Of course, it is a  horrible thing when any child develops leukemia. And if there's a local polluter, it's tempting to want  to make them pay, but it may not, &amp; in this case would not, be in the best interests of justice to do so.<br />3) How can we tolerate a legal system which allows the contemptible behavior of virtually every  character involved in this trial?<br />To give just a few examples, &amp; assuming Harr's portrayals are accurate:<br />Beyond the issue of their continual time-wasting objections and unwarranted motions, it seems clear  that the defense parties &amp; attorneys hid evidence from Schlichtmann during discovery.<br />Schlichtmann appears to have been completely irresponsible in ending pre-trial settlement negotiations  with Beatrice Foods.<br />The judge appears to have allowed his personal feelings about the genuinely annoying Schlichtmann to  influence how he handled motions and objections.<br />Anne Anderson, and a couple other plaintiffs, appear to have been petty, greedy &amp; ungrateful in  challenging Schlichtmann's billing after the settlement.<br />Then there's the attorney who sought a referral fee &amp; Trial Lawyers for Public Justice which sought  800k after bailing from the case.<br />&amp; people ask me why I don't choose to practice law?<br />Finally, I have one major problem with the manner in which Harr produced his story. At the end of  the book he reveals to the reader that he had virtually continual access to Schlichtmann &amp; company  during the trial &amp; only afterward assembled the defense's side. As an initial matter, it seems to me that  he should have told us this at the outset. And the reason for this brings up the larger issue; in a case that  was as emotionally compelling as this one was, dead kids, bankrupt plaintiff's lawyers, etc.., is it even  reasonable to believe that Harr's account is impartial. Shouldn't we assume that someone who was that close to the plaintiff's side throughout would develop some emotional investment in their case?<br />Ultimately, while I enjoyed the book, I found it's lack of analysis a major flaw and I think that it's  greatest value lies in it's exposure of the pathologies that plague the American legal system.<br />GRADE: C+rial, where Schlichtmann would  have paraded &quot;victims&quot; before the jury in an attempt to win a big money judgment.

Every major movie is three hours long,  even the insipid Summer blockbusters.  Authors from Don DeLillo to Tom Clancy crank out  enormous doorstop-like novels of 700 to 1,000 pages.  The artist Cristo doesn't just paint pictures, he  wraps entire islands in pink cellophane.  It is as if artists had lost confidence in their capacity to say  anything meaningful and so they opt instead to try to bury us in pure volume.  Heck, Bill Clinton's  State of the Union message this year--a message which until modern times President's were content to  simply write out and send up to the Hill--resembled a Fidel Castro harangue, lasting over an hour and  a half. Apparently, if you're not sure about the quality, make up for it with quantity.<br />The results have been predictably uneven--on the one hand, the perfectly adequate 1934 comedy Death  Takes a Holiday, which ran under 80 minutes, was recently turned into the interminable vanity project,  Meet Joe Black.  But on the other hand, Tom Wolfe's terrific A Man in Full (see Orrin's review)  actually had one of the best set pieces he's ever written, Ambush at Fort Bragg (see Orrin's review),  excised from the final novel.  It seem that, just as we would expect, the sheer size of these projects  bears no relation to the quality of the finished product.  It is still the case that great writers and  directors can produce outstanding longer works, but mediocre artists can not salvage their's, no matter  how they inflate them.<br />All of which brings us to Bridge on the River Kwai.  I'm sure that everyone is familiar with the story  from David Lean's 1957 masterpiece, starring Alec Guiness, William Holden, Jack Hawkins and  Sessue Hayakawa.  Lean was the undisputed master of the movie epic--with films like River Kwai,  Doctor Zhivago, Passage to India and Lawrence of Arabia to his credit--and his film version of  Boulle's novel is a mammoth, 2 1/2 hour, panorama.  It is unquestionably one of the greatest movies  ever made.<br />Boulle's original, while every bit as great, is a spare, economical novel, which compacts vexing moral  questions and ethical confrontations into a small but powerful package.  It stands as sort of a  demonstration that artists who actually have something to say need not resort to gigantism.  The only  major element that differs from the movie is that Lean needed an American actor for promotional  purposes, so the whole scenario with William Holden escaping the camp and then returning with the  demolition crew was added.  All of the moral quandaries that make the story so memorable and  timeless remain, despite the brevity of the book.<br />In fact, some of the themes emerge more forcefully.  Pierre Boulle was himself captured, imprisoned,  set to forced labor and then escaped from such a camp in Malaysia and one of the strongest  undercurrents in the book is the author's obvious contempt for the Japanese.  This is in many ways one  of the most racist (I mean that in a non pejorative sense, if such a thing is possible any longer) stories  ever told.  The underlying assumption is that the two colonial powers find these places in a state of  primitive savagery.  The Japanese merely seek to exploit them for their own purposes and do so in an  accordingly slipshod way.  The British, meanwhile, attempt to bring the highest standards of  civilization to bear and try to reengineer the wilderness so that it will stand as an eternal monument to  British values.  Boulle uses the construction of the bridge to demonstrate that the Japanese are brutal  incompetents and that the British, while they are the world's master builders (both of engineering  marvels and of civilizations), are so warped by their own rigid codes of duty and honor that they are  blinded to ultimate issues of the propriety of their actions.<br />I must have read this book or seen the movie dozens of times since I was a kid.  One of the really  remarkable things about the story is how different facets stand out each time, or is it just that at  different ages or in different social circumstances certain themes seem more important than at others.  When you're a callow youth, the whole thing is just a bang up military adventure.  In the late 60's and  early 70's the point of the story seemed to many to be simply anti-war--&quot;Madness! Madness!&quot; as  Clipton says.  Today, I read it and see a Frenchman dissing the Japanese and the British.  That Boulle  achieves this kaleidoscopic effect with such brevity is a remarkable accomplishment and should serve  as a reminder to all that increased size is no substitute for substantial ideas.<br />GRADE: A+y  remarkable things about the story is how different facets stand out each time, or is it just that at  different ages or in different social circumstances certain themes seem more important than at others.

Let's assume that the American public schools haven't completely gone to the dogs and that everyone  had to read this book at some point.  So you're all familiar with the basic story: young Northern man  boldly sallies forth to war despite Mom's entreaties, but then realizes that he has no idea why he's there  and fears that he may prove to be a coward.  Indeed, given his first taste of battle, he does bolt and  then wanders the battlefield too ashamed to return to his unit.  But when he finally rejoins them a blow  from the rifle butt of another soldier is mistaken for a battle wound and his cowardice is not  discovered.  Given a second chance, the youth redeems himself gloriously and in the process becomes  a man.<br />The novel's excellent reputation is well deserved; it is brief but brutally powerful.  Its descriptions of  battle certainly seem realistic and the moral dilemma of the young man is one of the central problems  of manhood.  There's nothing not to like.  So did I miss something?  Why does my copy, and why do  so many references to the book, refer to it as an antiwar statement?  I actually read it as a pro war  novel.<br />Let's go through the steps:<br />First, we've got the young man doubting his own courage and fearing that this feeling is unique to  him.  But the words of another soldier demonstrate that his fears are normal:<br />  The tall private waved his hand. &quot;Well&quot;, said he profoundly, &quot;I've thought it might get too hot for  Jim Conklin in some of them scrimmages, and if a whole lot of boys started and run, why, I s'pose  I'd start and run. And if I once started to run, I'd run like the devil, and no mistake. But if  everybody was a-standing and a-fighting, why, I'd stand and fight. Be jiminey, I would. I'll bet on  it.&quot;<br />  The youth of this tale felt gratitude for these words of his comrade. He had feared that all of the  untried men possessed great and correct confidence. He now was in a measure reassured.<br />I've argued elsewhere that every male has a little demon within him asking if, when push comes to  shove, he will have the physical and/or moral courage to be a man in the face of death.  This is one of  the reasons that war has always been with us, the desire to find the answer to the demon's question.  This is the element of Red Badge of Courage that makes it a universal tale.<br />At first, the young man is able, like millions of men before and after, to put aside his doubts by  subsuming himself within the fighting unit:<br />  He suddenly lost concern for himself, and forgot to look at a menacing fate. He became not a man  but a member. He felt that something of which he was a part--a regiment, an army, a cause, or a  country--was in crisis. He was welded into a common personality which was dominated by a single  desire. For some moments he could not flee no more than a little finger can commit a revolution  from a hand.<br />  If he had thought the regiment was about to be annihilated perhaps he could have amputated himself  from it. But its noise gave him assurance.  The regiment was like a firework that, once ignited,  proceeds superior to circumstances until its blazing vitality fades. It wheezed and banged with a  mighty power. He pictured the ground before it as strewn with the discomfited.<br />  There was a consciousness always of the presence of his comrades about him. He felt the subtle  battle brotherhood more potent even than the cause for which they were fighting. It was a  mysterious fraternity born of the smoke and danger of death.<br />  He was at a task. He was like a carpenter who has made many boxes, making still another box, only  there was furious haste in his movements. He, in his thoughts, was careering off in other places,  even as the carpenter who as he works whistles and thinks of his friend or his enemy, his home or  a saloon. And these jolted dreams were never perfect to him afterward, but remained a mass of  blurred shapes.<br />  Presently he began to feel the effects of the war atmosphere--a blistering sweat, a sensation that his  eyeballs were about to crack like hot stones.  A burning roar filled his ears.<br />  Following this came a red rage. He developed the acute exasperation of a pestered animal, a  well-meaning cow worried by dogs. He had a mad feeling against his rifle, which could only be  used against one life at a time. He wished to rush forward and strangle with his fingers. He craved a  power that would enable him to make a world-sweeping gesture and brush all back. His impotency  appeared to him, and made his rage into that of a driven beast.<br />  Buried in the smoke of many rifles his anger was directed not so much against the men whom he  knew were rushing toward him as against the swirling battle phantoms which were choking him,  stuffing their smoke robes down his parched throat. He fought frantically for respite for his senses,  for air, as a babe being smothered attacks the deadly blankets.<br />  There was a blare of heated rage mingled with a certain expression of intentness on all faces. Many  of the men were making low-toned noises with their mouths, and these subdued cheers, snarls,  imprecations, prayers, made a wild, barbaric these subdued cheers, snarls, imprecations, prayers,  made a wild, barbaric these subdued cheers, snarls, imprecations, prayers, made a wild, barbaric  these subdued cheers, snarls, imprecations, prayers, made a wild, barbaric song that went as an  undercurrent of sound, strange and chantlike with the resounding chords of the war march.<br />I have often heard it said that when a battle starts, soldiers aren't fighting for themselves or for their  countries or for ideas and ideals, fundamentally they are fighting to protect their buddies and fellow  soldiers.  As long as the young man keeps the battle in this perspective he is okay.<br />But then, he comes to doubt his fellows and seeks to save himself.  And it is this selfish decision to  flee which will haunt him and self loathing causes him to hate his victorious comrades:<br />  The youth cringed as if discovered in a crime. By heavens, they had won after all! The imbecile  line  had remained and become victors. He could hear cheering.<br />  He lifted himself upon his toes and looked in the direction of the fight. A yellow fog lay wallowing  on the treetops. From beneath it came the clatter of musketry. Hoarse cries told of an advance.<br />  He turned away amazed and angry. He felt that he had been wronged.<br />  He had fled, he told himself, because annihilation approached. He had done a good part in saving  himself, who was a little piece of the army.  He had considered the time, he said, to be one in which  is was the duty of every little piece to rescue itself if possible. Later the officers could fit the little  pieces together again, and make a battle front. If none of the little pieces were wise enough to save  themselves from the flurry of death at such a time, why, then, where would be the army? It was all  plain that he had proceeded according to very correct and commendable rules. His actions had been  sagacious things. They had been full of strategy. They were the work of a master's legs.<br />  Thoughts of his comrades came to him. The brittle blue line had withstood the blows and won. He  grew bitter over it. It seemed that the blind ignorance and stupidity of those little pieces had  betrayed him. He had been overturned and crushed by their lack of sense in holding the position,  when intelligent deliberation would have convinced them that it was impossible. He, the enlightened  man who looks afar in the dark, had fled because of his superior perceptions and knowledge. He  felt a great anger against his comrades. He knew it could be proved that they had been fools.<br />  He wondered what they would remark when later he appeared in camp. His mind heard howls of  derision. Their density would not enable them to understand his sharper point of view.<br />  He began to pity himself acutely. He was ill used. He was trodden beneath the feet of an iron  injustice. He had proceeded with wisdom and from the most righteous motives under heaven's blue  only to be frustrated by hateful circumstances.<br />  A dull, animal-like rebellion against his fellows, war in the abstract, and fate grew within him. He  shambled along with bowed head, his brain in a tumult of agony and despair. When he looked  loweringly up, quivering at each sound, his eyes had the expression of those of a great criminal  who thinks his guilt and his punishment great, and knows that he can find no words.<br />His self centered actions and cowardice have reduced him to an animal state.<br />His chance for redemption comes when he is unwittingly accepted back into the unit without anyone  knowing that he fled.

In fact, she's so dishonest that I believe that  she is the murderer and the whole book is a con job.  She was in love with Eli, Dana was going to  renew her relationship and so Jo killed her.  Now, years later, when Eli rejected her again, she decided  to try and pin it on him.  That's the only theory I can come up with to salvage this novel. Otherwise,  Jo is just so artificial and dishonest and so deserving of a horse whipping, that the book is  irredeemable.<br />The dust jacket of the book actually claims the following:<br />  While I Was Gone is an exquisitely suspenseful novel about how quickly a marriage can be  destroyed, how a good wife can find herself placing all she holds dear at risk.  In expert strokes,  Sue Miller captures the precariousness of even the strongest ties, the ease with which we abandon  each other, and our need to be forgiven.<br />Huh?  That's not the book that's contained within the jacket.  Jo is a horrible wife, mother, friend,  daughter and person.  Her life is a stack of lies and she's an impulsive, thrill seeking cretin.  I don't  know which was the most annoying moment in the book--the two bailouts in her first marriage, the  initial dalliance with an employee, the attempt to cheat on Daniel with Eli or the horrifying moment  when she announces her jealousy of her daughter's scrumping in the back of a van while the rest of the  band watched.  Actually, I'm pretty sure that last one is the worst.<br />The level of sustained delusion that Jo achieves during her narrative has to make one question her  sanity.  The saccharin 60's flashback to the Cambridge commune is especially, though unintentionally,  hilarious.  Through the mists of memory she sees this as her golden moment, when she was free &amp; in  love with everyone &amp; everything, but especially with Dana.  Who, by the way, she had never even told  her real name or shared her true life story with.  I mean c'mon.<br />This is a book that cries for the tiger to be let out of the cage.  Someone, Daniel or Eli or Jo needed to  just go gothic and start whacking people left and right.  As is, we have the ridiculous wrap up where  the police decide not to look into this matter, Eli &amp; Jo decide to coexist &amp; Daniel comes crawling back  like a whipped cur.<br />Finally, let me just say that I fear for a nation where it's treated as a great moral dilemma when  someone has to decide whether to report that they have information about a murder.  (David  Guterson's Snow Falling on Cedar used this device too, only there the character could exonerate a  suspect.)  Here's a little rule of thumb, if you considered someone a friend, you're sort of obligated to  let the police know that you know who murdered her, okay?<br />Ms Miller seems to be particularly challenged by these rather simple moral questions.  As I recall, her  book The Good Mother, depended on our sharing her sense of injustice that a Father tried regaining  custody of his daughter merely because the mother's boyfriend engaged in questionable sexual  behavior with her.

2161507:US	52173832	R1K1XZ59DAIXDZ	0679744665	686456715	The Moor's Last Sigh	Books	2	7	22	N	N	tedious	Salman Rushdie's chronicle of the da Gama-Zoigby merchant family wends its way from the 1492  expulsion, by Ferdinand and Isabella,  of Moslems and Jews from Spain to modern India, where Hindu  nationalists seek to define non Hindus out of India, back to Spain where the narrator is imprisoned by  a mad Moor.  It's two broadest themes seem to be: (1) that religious identity is not that important or, at  least, should not be considered that important; and (2) that the modern age (1492 you will readily  recall is the year that Columbus sailed) has been uniquely defined by such religious intolerance.  One  can obviously understand that a writer who is living under threat of death for blaspheming Mohammed  would feel this way, however, he is wrong on both counts.<br />As to the first point, individuals are defined by their religious/moral beliefs and cultures are defined by  the dominant religious/moral beliefs of their members.  Mr. Rushdie seems to relish turning religious  characters into evil caricatures; Abraham, for instance, is portrayed as the kind of evil  Jewish criminal  overlord that we would sooner expect to find in 1930's Nazi propaganda.  He seems to believe that  serious religious beliefs necessarily warp the soul &amp; make believers evil.  It's odd that this author who  is so widely celebrated as a victim of religious intolerance, is himself so intolerant of others.<br />In fact, there's a weird sort of dissonance in the outrage we hear from Mr. Rushdie and his defenders.  On the one hand, they loudly declare the importance of free expression and the right to broadcast  ideas, no matter how objectionable.  But on the other hand, they react in horror to the fact that ideas &amp;  speech have consequences.  Mr. Rushdie, like a neo-Nazi or a flag burner or a Klansman, has a right to  propound his ideas.  But having spewed forth his hate speech, he should not expect to be immune from  the violent reactions of those he attacks.  Ideas have consequences.  If you aren't willing to cope with  the consequences, don't express your ideas.  Along with the right to speak, comes the right to shut up.<br />As to the second point,  The Moor did breath his final sigh at the start of the Modern Age, but Mr.  Rushdie's focus on the expulsion of Jews and Moors from Spain is misplaced and his interpretation of  that moment as being fundamentally  about a birth of intolerance is inaccurate.  We date the Modern  Age (specifically The Renaissance) to this time period because, with the fall of Constantinople to the  Ottoman Empire, the Christian Church was forced back into the heart of Europe and brought forgotten  texts and learning back West with it.  Also, the Colombian voyages opened a New World &amp; unleashed  tremendous energies in Europe.  But most importantly, it was during these years that Martin Luther's  teachings and Guttenburg's printing press brought about a democratization of religion and learning.  These were the really important causes of the Modern Age, the resurrection of Spain under Ferdinand  and Isabella was more symptomatic of the general rise of Europe than causative of the Modern Age.<br />Moreover, far from leading to an age of intolerance, the opening of the New World, the birth of  Protestantism and the widespread access to learning provided by the printing press, all had the effect of  allowing for greater differences in religious beliefs.  The press put religious texts into people's hands,  Luther vindicated their right  to read them &amp; develop their own understandings of their meaning and  the New World provided a safety valve for those who would previously have been destroyed as  heretics, to flee &amp; establish their own communities of like believers.  Mr. Rushdie's attempt to square  the circle and equate the rise of fundamentalist Islam and Hindu nationalism with the rise of Europe, is  profoundly wrong.<br />Instead, these two spasms of intolerance are more readily comparable to the Inquisition.  Against the  great tide of the Reformation and Renaissance, the Catholic Church tried to interpose a breakwater of  intolerant conformity, but it was doomed to failure.  Similarly, fundamentalist Islam and nationalist  Hinduism will ultimately be swamped by the tides of Protestantism, Capitalism and Democracy.<br />Mr. Rushdie should recognize that the forces of history are on his side, relax a little, and return to  writing less portentous fictions like his Carrollesque Haroun and the Sea of Stories, to which,  incidentally, his little word plays are better suited.<br />GRADE: DAgainst the  great tide of the Reformation and Renaissance, the Catholic Church tried to interpose a breakwater of  intolerant conformity, but it was doomed to failure.

That's not particularly optimistic, is it ?  Moreover, to many,  what's particularly objectionable about this dark view is that it flows from a fairly low estimation of  our fellow men, which is perhaps best expressed in Edmund Burke's aphorism : &quot;There is no safety for  honest men but by believing all possible evil of evil men.&quot;  Unpleasant they may be, but these  attitudes are on full and glorious display in Aldous Huxley's novel, Ape and Essence.<br />The story is told in screenplay form--a narrative device which I found awkward--a script having blown  off of a truck which is hauling studio detritus to the dump.  The deceased screenwriter, William Tallis,  posits a future in which most of the world has been devastated by nuclear war.  Their island nation  having been spared major damage, the New Zealand Rediscovery Expedition to North America lands  on the California coast in 2108, looking for survivors.  Dr. Alfred Poole gets separated from the rest  of the party and taken in by the Belial worshipping natives.<br />In the wake of the catastrophe--which they refer to as the Thing--the remaining Southern Californians  are held in thrall by the sterilized priests of Belial, who seek to limit knowledge and quash human  desires, relegating the populace to a single two week period of sex a year (following Belial Day),  which produces an annual litter of mutant babies, some of whom are actually healthy enough to  replace the dead and dying adults.  This suffices to fulfill the rather limited purposes of their  decimated society : to serve Belial by accepting the punishment that has been visited upon them and to  avoid extinction.  Dr. Poole falls in love with Loola, a native girl, and they run away, the book ending  with them on their way to Bakersfield, stumbling upon the grave of William Tallis, where they quote  from the poem Adonais by Percy Bysse Shelley :<br />  That Light whose smile kindles the Universe,  That Beauty in which all things work and move,  That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse  Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love  Which through the web of being blindly wove  By man and beast and earth and air and sea,  Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of  The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me,  Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.<br />and share a hard-boiled egg.<br />Such are the bare bones of the rather meager plot, but the real meat of the book is Huxley's scorching  attacks on Man's faith in himself :<br />  Cruelty and compassion come with chromosomes;  All men are merciful and all are murderers.  Doting on dogs, they build their Dachaus;  Fire whole cities and fondle the orphans;  Are loud against lynching, but all for Oakridge;  Full of future philanthropy, but today the NKVD.  Whom shall we persecute, for whom feel pity ?  It is all a matter of the moment's mores,  Of words on wood pulp, of radios roaring,  Of Communist kindergartens or first communions.  Only in the knowledge of his own Essence  Has any man ceased to be many monkeys.<br />and on the idea of Progress :<br />  Progress --the theory that you can get something for nothing; the theory that you can gain in one  field without paying for your gain in another; the theory that you alone can understand the meaning  of history; the theory that you know what's going to happen fifty years from now; the theory that,  in the teeth of all experience, you can foresee all the consequences of your present actions; the  theory that Utopia lies just ahead and that, since ideal ends justify the abominable means, it is your  privilege and duty to rob, swindle, torture, enslave and murder all those who, in your opinion  (which is, by definition, infallible), obstruct the onward march to the earthly paradise.<br />I have to admit that I've always been so intent on using Brave New World as a scourge against  totalitarian Utopias, I blinded myself to the deeply anti-technology aspects of Huxley's vision.  But  you can't make the same mistake here, as Huxley clobbers the reader over the head with his contempt  for &quot;science&quot; :<br />  ...what we call knowledge is merely another form of Ignorance--highly organized, of course, and  eminently scientific, but for that very reason all the more complete, all the more productive of  angry apes.  When Ignorance was merely ignorance, we were the equivalents of lemurs, marmosets  and howler monkeys.

Wilson's a competent enough writer and was a minor celebrity in his own right--he even  placed a book on the Modern Library Top 100 Nonfiction Books of the 20th Century--but I found  myself only really paying attention when he's talking about the other personalities of the day : F. Scott  Fitzgerald, H. L. Mencken, Dorothy Parker, etc.  They somehow seemed to be more compelling  figures, and the rest of the book, which Wilson has to carry by the force of his own personality,  seemed flat and less interesting.  Unfortunately, the same phenomenon plagues Caleb Carr's novel, The  Alienist.<br />The central conceit of the story is that Teddy Roosevelt, during his stint as NY Police Commissioner,  calls on two old Harvard classmates, Dr. Laszlo Kreizler (the &quot;alienist&quot; of the title) and New York  Times reporter, John Schuyler Moore, to help investigate a grisly series of murders of boy prostitutes.  All three men were students of William James, and Roosevelt hopes that the application of modern  psychological theories and investigative techniques will prove efficacious.<br />In 1896 though, psychology is still a young and, appropriately, controversial &quot;science&quot; and the police  force is totally corrupt and reactionary, so Roosevelt has them operate independently, though he does  loan them two detectives, the iconoclastic Jewish brothers Marcus and Lucius Isaacson, and his own  secretary, Sara Howard, one of the first women ever to work for the Department, as a liaison between  him and the team.  They are also joined by Kreizler's intimidating black manservant, Cyrus, and a  street urchin who he's reforming, Stevie.<br />Though Kreizler is an obviously Sherlock Holmes-type figure, this unusual team has more of the feel  of Kenneth Robeson's great Doc Savage and Avenger adventures.  Unfortunately, Carr is caught  midway between trying to write a serious historical novel, a la E. L. Doctrow (whose novel The  Waterworks this book so much resembles), and surrendering to the pulp fiction elements of the story.  Hewing to the middle ground serves the tale poorly; he should have just chosen a path and followed it.<br />Equally disconcerting, is his tendency to have major characters disappear for extended periods.  Teddy  Roosevelt was a dreadful president, but he's a fascinating character.  Every time he appears he jazzes  the story up, but as he fades into the background, it loses steam.  This leaves Kreizler and his genius as  the star attraction, but with about 100 pages left in the novel, he too fades away for awhile.  It's  arguable that the narrative line demands his disappearance, but totally unjustifiable is the extended  absence of the Isaacson brothers, who provide much needed comic relief when they are on the scene,  but are shipped out West as part of the investigation.  All of these problems are exacerbated by the fact  that Moore, who narrates the story, is simply not a very appealing host, by turns thick-headed,  petulant, and self-righteous.<br />The basic mystery is adequate, if really little more than an early effort at psychological profiling.  But  be honest, aren't we all pretty tired of serial killers.  I know I am.  The real reason to read the book is  for the 1890's flavor and the, all too brief, cameos by historical figures.  These aspects of the novel are  enough to earn it a cautious recommendation, but it's a generally disappointing effort, especially  considering how effective the set up is.<br />I was under the impression that Carr had actually sold the movie rights before the book was even  published--though one would think it would have been made by now--and it has all the elements of not  just a terrific film, but a potential franchise.  A director would be able to handle with visuals much of  the atmosphere and historical background that Carr has to present in great blocks of explanatoryprose.  Good casting would also allow for the various personalities of the team members to come to  the fore.  We often see great books turned into rotten movies; here's a chance for someone to turn a  promising but ultimately mediocre book into a good movie--for a change.<br />GRADE : C+anatory  prose.

When we first meet  Neal Carey he's a graduate student at Columbia, working on a degree in 18th Century English  Literature.  But then he receives a call from his &quot;Dad,&quot; Joe Graham, who turns out to be the  one-armed dwarf who sort of adopted Neal when he was eleven years old and running the streets.  A  series of flashbacks shows Graham teaching Neal how to survive and grooming him for an eventual  position trouble shooting for a shadowy organization called Friends of the Family, who look after the  interests of the wealthy clients of the Kitteridge family bank in Providence, RI.  Over the years, Neal  learned everything from how to tail people to how to search a room without anyone ever knowing, and  in the course of these unusual studies, Joe realized that Neal was a gifted student.  Eventually the  Friends send him to school, but now they need him for a special assignment.<br />It's 1976 and with Jimmy Carter likely to win the Democratic presidential nomination, he's expected to  look for a northern running mate.  Senator John Chase of Rhode Island has a decent shot at the job,  but there's one significant skeleton in his closet : his troublesome teenage daughter has run away to  London.  Now it's up to Neal to go find her and bring her back in time for the Convention.<br />Neal is a streetwise and sassy hero, which makes for plenty of snappy banter.  And the London he  arrives in is in the midst of the birth of punk rock, which provides an unusually anarchic backdrop to  the action.  Add in a priceless first edition of Tobias Smollett's The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle  and a double-crosser within the Friends and you've got a mystery that cleverly mixes elements of  classic noir with various innovations of the author's own.  Imagine Oliver Twist by way of Raymond  Chandler with a soundtrack by The Clash, and you'll capture something of the spirit of the story.  It all  makes for great fun and I look forward to reading the subsequent books in the series.<br />GRADE : A-ll  makes for great fun and I look forward to reading the subsequent books in the series.<br />GRADE : A-	2000-12-24

David Rains Wallace succeeds only in the first of these tasks.<br />Bulow Hammock is a wooded swampland in eastern Florida, around Daytona.  Wallace, whose  grandmother lived in nearby Ormond-by-the-Sea, has been visiting it since he was a child.  In this  book he writes, often compellingly about what he has observed there and he relates his own  experiences to those of the great naturalist John James Audubon, who seems to have hated the place,  and those of William Bartram, whose 1701 book, , was apparently influential in the development of  Romanticism.  So far, so good.<br />But, in addition, Wallace throughout tries to prove a rather dubious premise : that the human brain and  the hammock have many similarities :<br />  I wondered if I might explore the hammock not only as a home of wild plants and animals but as a  connection to my wayward brain.  The brain is like forests in being diverse and multilayered.  I'd  even felt in the western mountains that the old-growth forests might have a kind of consciousness  arising from complexity.  Like my brain, the hammock was structured hierarchically, with newer,  more complex things growing from older ones.  Most mysteriously, brain and hammock shared a  propensity for mimesis, for producing similarities between different things.<br />This whole train of thought, which starts out merely silly, eventually trails off into pure blather.  The  desire of environmentalists and their allies to anthropomorphize nature is perfectly understandable--the  more human that nature is made to appear the more likely we are to protect it.  But here's one thing we  can all be certain of, the trees of Bulow Hammock do not have a consciousness; they don't actually  realize that they are a forest.  Nature is fascinating enough without our overreaching to draw human  connections which simply do not exist.<br />These rather dubious speculations on Wallace's part end up detracting from the book, rather than  adding to it.  I'd still recommend it for the beauty and wit of his observations, but it fails rather  spectacularly in the reach for broader themes.<br />GRADE : C+ascinating enough without our overreaching to draw human  connections which simply do not exist.<br />These rather dubious speculations on Wallace's part end up detracting from the book, rather than  adding to it.

Frank Armani and Francis  Beige were Central New York attorneys appointed to represent serial killer/rapist Robert Garrow, who  went on a crime spree in the Adirondacks in 1973.  Their client was charged with one killing but  revealed to them the location of two other bodies.  After checking to be sure the bodies were there, the  attorneys tried, unsuccessfully, to use this information as part of a plea bargain.  Meanwhile, they were  contacted by the distraught father of one of these victims, begging for information about the fate of his  child.  Believing that forensic evidence available from the remains might tend to further incriminate  Garrow, they refused to acknowledge any information about other potential victims.  Eventually,  Garrow himself revealed the information at trial and the attorneys were charged with violating the  code of professional conduct.  Though the case and the surrounding publicity had devastating effects  on the two men, they were ultimately exonerated, on the basis that they had acted within the scope of  attorney-client privilege.<br />Though I would have behaved differently, I do not particularly quarrel with the attorneys' actions.  I  do though find the ethical regime which requires such a result to be abhorrent.  The basic theory  underlying attorney-client privilege is that in order to guarantee the best possible defense, clients must  fully disclose all information to their attorneys, and that the only way to insure that they feel  comfortable doing so is to grant the privilege.  This reasoning is simply not compelling.  If full  disclosure really is essential to a good defense, then the client has a vested interest in disclosure--they  after all are the ones most interested in a good defense.  It seems entirely fair to let them choose  between holding back incriminating information at their own expense, or sharing that information at  some peril.<br />Moreover, to allow (arguably, to require) lawyers to withhold such information from the Court is to  turn the legal system into more of a game than a search for truth and justice.  I have no problem with a  set of ethical rules, societal laws and constitutional rights, which seeks to protect the innocent from  unfair prosecution and even to protect the guilty from abusive practices, but this must be balanced  against society's interest in protecting its citizenry, enforcing the law and meting out justice.  There has  to be some difference between preventing law enforcement officers from beating information out of a  suspect or illegally searching his premises, and officers of the Court actually withholding evidence that  they are aware of, however obtained.  I just don't see what interest was vindicated by concealing the  existence and location of the two corpses.  Were they revealed to law enforcement it would not  negatively impact Garrow's access to a fair trial : if he did not kill them, he'd have nothing to fear.  If  he did, evidence from the bodies might well point towards him, but so what ?  The essence of the legal  process should be that impartial examination of the evidence reveal the culprit and that evidence be  used to convince a jury of his guilt.  The mere revelation of the bodies would not have sent Garrow to  prison, he still would have been afforded all the legal protections of the trial system and his fate would  have still depended on the judgment of a jury of his peers.<br />As I say, I would have acted differently than did Armani and Beige--I would have told the father  where the bodies were, informed the Court of my action and resigned from the practice of law,  accepting whatever punishment this action entailed.  Then again, I never practiced, so that's easy for  me to say.  Further, I understand that many attorneys believe in the necessity of rules such as this and  feel that they serve noble purposes.  For that reason, I too would have exonerated these men.  It is the  professional code itself that leads lawyers to make these kind of decisions and we can hardly punish  them for behaving ethically.  But it does seem that ethics and morality diverge at points like this : one  would prefer to see morality triumph over ethics.  Regardless of how you come down on the issues  involved, this book offers a fascinating look at how such issues and decisions play out in the real world  and how they impact the people who have to deal with them.<br />GRADE : B+exonerated these men.

[Phyllis  Dorothy] James  1920-)  (Grade: B+)  ], you'd be hard pressed to call most of them hard-boiled.  So  acclaimed new novelist Jenny Siler--whose first book, Easy Money, was a NY Times Notable Book of  the Year in 1999--and Meg Gardner, the anti-heroine of this second effort, are blazing a new trail;  unless there are strong objections, we'll call it &quot;chick noir.&quot;<br />Megan Gardner has recently returned to Missoula, Montana after serving an 18 month prison sentence  in New Mexico.  Her checkered past is partly the result of one horrific incident in her childhood, when  her mother shot and severely brain-damaged her father.  Now Meg is repossessing cars and trying to  reconstruct her life in her old hometown.  She's estranged from her mom, who beat the shooting rap  but is now consigned to caring for Megan's nearly zombie-like father.  In addition, she's got a Czech  boyfriend, though she refuses to refer to him that way and won't tell him she loves him; a drag queen  repo partner; a Russian gangster who owes her a favor or two; and the chief of police has sort of kept  an eye on her since he investigated the shooting years ago.<br />One winter night, Meg snatches a Jeep belonging to Clay Bennett, a local businessman who was killed  earlier in the evening by a young Indian couple.  But several thugs and a brawny female assassin come  after Meg, in search of a map that Bennett may have been carrying in a briefcase that he left in the  car.  Further complicating things is Meg's growing belief that the accused Indian woman, Tina Red  Deer, may be her own half sister.  Drawn into the case by a series of threats, Meg ends up  investigating the murder and trying to find whatever it is the missing map leads to.<br />There are some fairly significant problems with the novel.  The mystery at its center is never  satisfactorily explained and the political spin that Siler incorporates is somewhat gratuitous.  More  troubling is that much of the emphasis is on Meg's tangled family past, but none of her relationships--  with her father, her mother, or with Tina--are ever resolved.  One supposes that these intensely  personal and introspective private eye stories are here to stay, but here Meg is so emotionally distant  from everyone around her, many of whom are bending over backwards trying to help, that it's hard to  work up much empathy for her.  Megan's emotional baggage makes her an interesting character, but  one who is ultimately more off-putting than affecting.<br />On the other hand, Ms Siler is a very deft writer, she really revels in the opportunity for flashy  metaphors that the snowbound Montana setting affords.  And Meg is much tougher than many of her  modern detective peers, female or male [see Orrin's review of A Savage Place  (1981)(Robert B.  Parker  1932-) (Grade: A)]  Especially impressive is her final showdown with and disposition of the  female killer.  It's a good, but not great, book and one that hints at much better things to come.<br />GRADE : B-he mystery at its center is never  satisfactorily explained and the political spin that Siler incorporates is somewhat gratuitous.

One may know a man better after six months  with him beyond the Arctic circle than after a lifetime of acquaintance in cities.  There is  something--I know not what to call it--in those frozen spaces, that brings a man face to face with  himself and with his companions; if he is a man, the man comes out; and, if he is a cur, the cur  shows as quickly.  -Admiral Peary<br />One's first impulse is to dismiss this book as just another quickie attempt to cash in on the Endurance  craze, but the story of the Karluk and its crew is quite amazing in its own right and first time author  Jennifer Niven does a terrific job telling it.  One year before Ernest Shackleton and Endurance set out  for Antarctica, Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, working under the auspices of the Canadian  government, assembled an expedition intended to prove that a continent lay beneath the Arctic ice.  On June 17, 1913, the H.M.C.S. Karluk, captained by Robert Abram Bartlett, set sail from British  Columbia with a complement of 25, including Stefansson, sailors, scientists, and Eskimos (including a  mother and two young daughters), plus sled dogs and a cat. Within the six weeks the ship was frozen  fast in the ice north of Alaska and Stefansson, taking three men and several sleds with dogs, had  abandoned the rest of the Canadian Arctic Expedition, setting out for the mainland to continue his  exploration.<br />For the next five months, the Karluk drifted westward with the ice floe, before finally being crushed  and sunk on January 11, 1914, just east of Wrangel Island, which lies north of Siberia.  With the crew  facing the predictable difficulties caused by brutal weather, a diet of pemmican, seal, and the like,  snow blindness, etc, and no reason to believe that anyone even knew they were still alive, let alone  where they were, Bartlett and Kataktovik, one of the Eskimo guides, set out across the shifting ice for  Siberia to get help.  Meanwhile, with the departure of Bartlett, the remaining crew splintered into rival  camps and added to the struggle with the elements was an atavistic struggle against each other, ending  in betrayal, thievery and maybe even murder.<br />The story of who survives and how and of the feats that survival requires, makes for compelling  reading.  Stefansson is the main villain of the story, his inadequacy as a leader beginning with his  purchase of the Karluk at a bargain price, even though it was clearly not suited to ice breaking, and  ending with his doctoring reports of the expedition to cast aspersions on Bartlett while portraying  himself in a favorable light.  Bartlett on the other hand, the Ice Master of the title, emerges as a truly  heroic figure.  There are plenty of other heroes and villains--one of the more interesting of the former  is Seaman Hugh &quot;Clam&quot; Williams, whose nickname is more than justified when he stoically sits  through having his frostbitten toe cut off with a pair of shears--and myriad instances of courage and  cowardice.<br />The reader can't help being torn between questioning the common sense of the men who followed the  obviously incompetent Stefansson and admiration for the fortitude that many of them displayed in the  face of disaster.  And just as you're coming to grips with this quandary, the author provides a helpful  endnote where she reveals that various survivors fought in WWI, returned to Arctic exploration and  one even joined a colonization party that Stefansson later sent to Wrangel Island, with predictably  tragic results.  It all makes for thrilling reading, side by side with alternately troubling and uplifting  glimpses of the deeds of which humans are capable when they are pushed to their limits.<br />GRADE : Aor  Siberia to get help.

Carolyn is a  doctor, Ben a sculptor, and they have two kids, Judith and Jacob.  Things could not appear more  mundane for this family of four.  But then one night while working the emergency room, Carolyn is  confronted by the brutally beaten corpse of a teenage girl whom she recognizes.  What she does not  realize is that it was her son Jacob who bludgeoned the girl to death with a car jack.  This killing will  explode in the midst of the family, driving both parents to reckless actions, pitting one against the  other, mother against son and daughter against all.  Narrated alternately by husband and wife and  finally by Judith, Brown presents all sides of the contentious battle that ensues as Jacob goes to trial for  murder.  Ben unquestioningly supports Jacob from the word go, even going so far as to destroy  evidence and lie to cops, courts and his own lawyer.  Carolyn is more troubled, particularly as  evidence mounts that, not only did Jacob commit this crime, he is a borderline psychopath who has  molested his own sister.  Finally, unable to deal with her own guilt, Carolyn sides with the  prosecution.  And so on and so forth.<br />Rosellen Brown is to be commended for making the effort to turn out a page turning thriller that also  tackles substantial issues of family loyalty, moral responsibility and the limits of love.  But the book  has one huge flaw at its center--we so loathe the Reisers that there is nothing sufficiently horrible that  could happen to them.  Jacob is after all a predator.  As I was reading I found myself regretting that he  could not get the death penalty here in New Hampshire.  So, suffice it to say, I did not feel much  sympathy with the father who aided and abetted in the cover up of the crime.  And it takes so long for  Carolyn to screw up her courage and do the right thing, that by then I couldn't give her any credit.  In  fact, when she does finally cooperate with the authorities, it is not out of any sense of right and wrong,  she is driven purely by guilt.  Her action follows the best, most authentic, scene in the book, when she  attempts to commiserate with the murdered girls mother, telling her that the crime has shattered both  families.  The girl's mother reacts with a righteous indignation that has the reader cheering.  Here is  the character that we can identify with, at last.  And it is only after this that Carolyn finally realizes  that she is not herself a victim and folks don't feel sorry for her.  When she testifies, it is a selfish act,  an attempt to reclaim her own reputation, regardless of the consequences to her vile little offspring.<br />But Ben is no better.  The son he is trying to protect is some idealized golden child who bears no  relation to the monster he raised.  His refusal to cooperate with the authorities is less about protecting a  beloved son than proving something about himself.  These are not characters who love one another.  Each of them is merely an object to the other and relations among them are premised on how others  perceive them, not on any genuine sense of caring and family.<br />Ms Brown's depiction of this Baby Boomer couple and their completely self-centered reaction to these  events may well be accurate.  And such folks may even be so self absorbed that they could bring up  this repellent child without noticing that he is evil.  But their obliviousness strained credulity and once  we accept it, we necessarily think less of them.  This inevitably creates an emotional distance from the  characters and saps the story of much of its drama.  By the time I got to the weirdly happy ending,  she'd completely lost me.<br />American society has developed a really troubling aversion to the concept of whistleblowing.  Communists and mobsters are celebrated for refusing to testify about massive criminal conspiracies.  Linda Tripp became the most hated woman in America byexposing wrongdoing in the Oval Office.  And people were genuinely shocked when the Unabomber's brother lead the FBI to him.  I don't know  what the heck people are thinking.

Richard Papen is  a lower middle class Californian who has wended his way to Hampden College in Vermont, largely  because he like the picture on the catalogue. Richard happens to be proficient in several languages, so  he tries getting into one of Professor Julian Morrow's classical language classes.  But he discovers that  Morrow only teaches a select handful of students and teaches every class that they take.  They form an  elite clique within the elite campus.  Eventually, Richard attaches himself to this group and is admitted  to Morrow's disciple hood.<br />Morrow remains a sort of opaque presence, but Richard's life is soon entwined with the other students,  lead by the wealthy &amp; arrogant Henry Winter and including Charles and Camilla MacCaulay, the  overly close twins, Francis Abernathy, a flamboyant homosexual, and Edmund &quot;Bunny&quot; Corcoran, a  rumpled preppy of dubious social grace.  Richard longs to fit into this group and, ashamed of his  rather plebeian origins, is soon inventing a fake background for himself and taking on pseudo  sophisticated airs.<br />However, there's more to this little clan than meets the eye, and as the story unfolds, he discovers that  during an attempt to recreate a Dionysian frenzy, Henry, Francis and the twins have killed a local man.  Now Bunny has found them out &amp; is basically blackmailing them, exacting a cruel revenge for their  many slights.  Inevitably, they decide that Bunny must die and the rest of the book deals with the  murder's aftermath.<br />When this book was first published it was attended by tremendous hype, both because of the youth of  the author and because of her mentors, Willie Morris &amp; Brett Easton Ellis among them.  But the hype,  and the comparisons to Crime and Punishment,  could not obscure the fact that Ms Tartt had penned an  absorbing gothic mystery which quickly became a bestseller.<br />I agree with many of the criticisms of the novel.  Some of the characters are underwritten and we are  not adequately exposed to the teaching of Julian Morrow that makes him so attractive to the students.  However, these legitimate gripes are outweighed by the creepy mesmeric can't-put-it-down story that  the author weaves.<br />In addition, I think there's another reading that you can apply to the book with some profit.  The  effete, elitist, amoral, hothouse atmosphere fostered by Morrow and embraced by the clique is an apt  metaphor for the modern university.  Here are students who are absorbed by their studies, or at least  by the aura of their studies, 24 hours a day, who cede complete control of their own minds to their  instructor.  Not content with the elitism of a University so expensive that there are few middle class  students anyway, they've further segregated themselves into a small band of like minded students. If  they get in trouble, it's in the pursuit of some romantic intellectual ideal and after all, who do they kill,  just a townie and a slacker student.<br />However you interpret the story, it's a rewarding reading experience.<br />GRADE: A-fact that Ms Tartt had penned an  absorbing gothic mystery which quickly became a bestseller.<br />I agree with many of the criticisms of the novel.

Or perhaps that is simply a function  of the fact that we all grow up reading the great tales of O. Henry.  And of all those stories and of all  those shocking payoffs, there is perhaps no other twist quite like the one at the end of Gift of the  Magi.<br />Jim and Della Young are a wretchedly poor young married couple.  Della has just $1.87 to buy a  Christmas gift for Jim and between them they have precious little of any value:<br />  Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a  mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other  was Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let  her hair hang out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts.  Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have  pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.<br />Well, you either know the rest or else I wouldn't want to ruin it for you.  Suffice it to say that O.  Henry leaves us with the following thought:<br />  The magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in  the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no  doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have  lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely  sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these  days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive  gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.<br />This exquisite little story beautifully captures the spirit of the season.

I made a snowman and my brother  knocked it down and I knocked my brother down and then we had tea.&quot;<br />  &quot;But that was not the same snow,&quot; I say. &quot;Our snow was not only shaken from white wash buckets  down the sky, it came shawling out of the ground and swam and drifted out of the arms and hands  and bodies of the trees; snow grew overnight on the roofs of the houses like a pure and grandfather  moss, minutely -ivied the walls and settled on the postman, opening the gate, like a dumb, numb  thunder-storm of white, torn Christmas cards.&quot;<br />And they are wonderfully evocative of his Welsh youth.<br />But for me they also evoked another memory, of a trip that Bud Rouse and I made up to Saratoga.  We visited friends of his who worked at the track and had a horse of their own (Double Russian was  the name, if memory serves).  We had fun at the races, hanging on the far side with all the Hispanic  groomsmen and walkers and cussing out prima donna jockeys.  And after dinner and a few frosties that  night, our host took down a collection of Dylan Thomas poems and we took turns reading them  aloud.  It was precisely the kind of affected scene that you'd expect in a Manhattan novel or like  something out of a gutter version of Jane Austen, but I'll be damned if we didn't have fun.<br />The best, most treasured, books and writers of our lives become entwined in our existence in just such  odd and unique ways.  Then any time we encounter them again, they trigger a cascade of memories.  For no reason that will ever matter to anyone else, Dylan Thomas is such a writer for me.

You don't have to take my word about this book and you don't have to buy it or check it out of the  library; three of the better stories are actually available online : The Twenty-Seventh Man; The Gilgul  of Park Avenue; and For the Relief of Unbearable Urges.  Take a look for yourself, for free, and draw  your own conclusions.  Of these, I would particularly recommend Twenty-Seventh Man, which I  thought was the best in this collection.<br />Personally, I think that these three stories demonstrate both the considerable strength and the  significant weakness of Englander's style.  Each of the stories is built up around a clever idea : a group  of writers is taken away to be executed, but an unpublished writer, accidentally included, authors their  final tale; a WASP has an epiphany in a New York City taxi cab and realizes he has a Jewish soul,  much to his wife's chagrin; and, an Orthodox Israeli whose wife won't sleep with him gets a  dispensation from his rabbi to visit a prostitute, &quot;for the relief of unbearable urges.&quot;  These are all  engaging situations, but as the stories progress, the author seems intent on torturing the characters. He  writes with great humor and wit about the collision between traditional religiosity and the modern  world, but in the end, each tale is pretty depressing.  Now, from what the profiles say, and what  Englander says himself in interviews, I take it that he was raised an Orthodox Jew, but has abandoned  his beliefs.  That's all well and good, but it seems a mistake to me to draw the conclusion from his  own experience that piety and reality are incompatible.  I was left admiring Englander's talent, but not  much liking his stories.<br />GRADE : C	2000-12-18
2171772:US	52173832	R25EGJ53GCPXT4	0451525140	238139619	Three by Flannery O'Connor (Signet Classics)	Books	5	22	24	N	N	perhaps our most underrated author	Wise Blood (1952)(Flannery O'Connor 1925-68)<br />  All human nature vigorously resists grace because grace changes us and the change is painful.  -Flannery O'Connor<br />Wise Blood is Flannery O'Connor's grotesque picaresque tale of Hazel Motes of Eastrod, Tennessee; a  young man who has come to the city of Taulkinham bringing with him an enormous resentment of  Christianity and the clergy.  He is in an open state of rebellion against the rigidity of his itinerant  preacher grandfather and his strict mother.  So when one of the first people he encounters is the blind  street preacher Asa Hawks and Motes finds himself both attracted and repelled by Hawks' bewitching  fifteen year old daughter Lily Sabbath, he reacts by establishing his own street ministry.  He founds  the &quot;Church without Christ&quot;:<br />  Listen you people, I'm going to take the truth with me wherever I go.  I'm going to preach it to  whoever'll listen at whatever place.  I'm going to preach there was no Fall because there was  nothing to fall from and no Redemption because there was no Fall and no Judgment because there  wasn't the first two.  Nothing matters but that Jesus was a liar.<br />As you can guess the church is singularly unsuccessful, although he does attract a couple of other  crackpots:  Enoch Emery a young man who works at the zoo and longs for a kind word from anybody;  and Onnie Jay Holy, yet another rival preacher who believes Motes when he says he's found a &quot;new  jesus.&quot;<br />While at first this cast of bizarre characters, ranging from merely repugnant to truly evil, and the  scenes of physical, moral and  spiritual degradation through which they pass all seem to be just a little  too much, the reader is carried along by O'Connor's sure hand for dark comedy.  The book is very  funny.  But as the story draws to a close, O'Connor's true mission is revealed; Motes loses his fight  against faith and he achieves a kind of grace, becoming something like a Christian martyr to atone for  his sins.  O'Connor has something serious and important to say about the modern human condition and  the emptiness of a life without faith.  That she is able to disguise this message in such a ribald comic  package is quite an achievement.<br />Reading the book inevitably called to mind Carson McCullers' dreadful book The Heart Is a Lonely  Hunter (1940), which made the Modern Library Top 100 Novels of the Twentieth Century list.  It too  is a Southern gothic, populated by dismal misanthropes.  But it is devoid of humor and has nothing to  say about the characters and the world they've created.  Wise Blood is a superior novel in every sense  and really deserves that spot on the list.<br />GRADE: A+<br />The Violent Bear It Away  (1960)(Flannery O'Connor  1925-68)<br />  From the days of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the  violent bear it away.  -Matthew 11:12<br />Flannery O'Connor wrote with one of the most distinctive voices in American Literature; a kind of  grotesque amalgam of Jonathan Edwards, Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Allen Poe, and William  Faulkner.  She perceived the world in starkly Manichean terms, as a struggle between the forces of  Light and Dark, Good and Evil. The Violent Bear it Away is a psychomachia--literally a battle for the  soul--the story of a backwoods Southern boy named Francis Marion Tarwater (see The Violent Bear it  Away and The Bible by Angela Lucey for more on this).  The boy's great uncle, an Old Testament  style patriarch, kidnapped him away from an uncle, George Rayber, and has raised him to be a prophet  of God.  Upon his great uncle's death, Tarwater rejects the prophetic mission and heads to the city to  live with his uncle, who tries to wean the boy away from the teachings of the great uncle.  Through a  series of increasingly violent actions Tarwater is eventual driven back to the woods and a final  acceptance of God and his own role in God's plans.<br />This ispowerful stuff, O'Connor felt that exaggeration and caricature were more likely to reach a  modern audience than more subtle styles ever could.  Combine that with her vision of violence as a  sort of crucible which forces the individual to make a final choice between Good and Evil, and you've  got the makings of a truly disturbing fiction.  The book will surely not appeal to all tastes, but it is  undeniably affecting and thought provoking.<br />GRADE: B-own role in God's plans.<br />This is powerful stuff, O'Connor felt that exaggeration and caricature were more likely to reach a  modern audience than more subtle styles ever could.

I've had a secret for  years now, one that strikes right to the core of my manhood : of an evening, I enjoy a nice cup of tea.  Actually, it's an enormous mug and I steep the tea until it looks like coffee, but I still acknowledge  how sketchy it all appears.  Nor do I imagine my case will be helped if I state that I most often enjoy  said beverage on Sunday nights during Booknotes on CSPAN, though as a general matter I do  occasionally partake when I sit down to read, after we get the kids to bed.  There--I've said it--that  monkey's off my back.  Why here?  Why now?  Because, this book may be the sine qua non of  tea-sipping books.<br />Perhaps the central theme that we've been developing over the course of these reviews is the existence  of a fundamental tension in human affairs, between the basically feminine desire for security and the  basically masculine desire for freedom.  We've examined many examples of the latter--everything  from Huckleberry Finn to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest--but good examples of the former have  been rarer, presumably because I just read fewer women authors.  (Though we have found some good  examples, try particularly the review of The House of Gentle Men)  Now we come to Sarah Orne  Jewett's lovely short novel, The Country of Pointed Firs, and the very essence of the book is the value  of friendship (particularly female friendship), community, and continuity in providing an atmosphere  of security and a bulwark against the encroachments of a changing world.<br />The semiautobiographical novel tells of a young woman writer spending a summer in the fictional  town of Dunnett Landing on the coast of Maine.  There she is adopted into a loose knit group of  women who weave a web of stories about the town, the surrounding islands and the folks who live, or  lived, there.  This narrative tradition and the time spent in each others company take on the quality of  ritual, and in light of their dismissal of the local pastor, a nearly religious ritual.  In addition, Jewett's  comparisons of the women to figures out of Greek drama and classical myth gives them a timeless  quality.  Most of all, there is her portrayal of the women as a phenomenon of Nature, arising  organically from, and blending into, the rugged landscape.<br />The effect of all of this is that as the women speak they seem to be tapping into an eternal tradition.  Their voices and stories summoning echoes from the past, not just of Dunnett Landing, but of similar  communities across time and space.  The term that has apparently been adopted to describe this kind of  novel is &quot;fiction of community,&quot; and that's a perfect description.  There's something wonderfully  comforting about the togetherness, shared sense of experience and the act of communal memory that  Jewett's stories summon.<br />The flip side of this however is that the novel, not surprisingly since it is so clearly a response to  classic masculine fiction, suffers from some inevitable weaknesses when judged by those standards.  It  is almost totally formless and plotless, being little more than a collection of reminiscences.  It  celebrates stasis rather than progress and at some level reflects a genuine and unhealthy fear of human  development in general, and of industrialization specifically.  Though relentlessly good natured, there  is a marked indifference or even hostility to traditional religion.  Politics and economics are  completely, and unrealistically, absent from the scene.<br />Just as the &quot;action&quot; of the novel occurs at the very edge of the nation, figuratively outside the bounds  of late 19th Century America, so the community it describes is a utopian one that is an alternative to  our actual Western culture.  Ultimately, that utopia, like most, seems like it might be a nice place to  visit but like it would prove stultifying to the human spirit, the longing to discover and to achieve, the  desire of the young to create their own place in the world rather than to simply assume a bequeathed  place in their parent's.  There's always something comforting about maternal unconditional love, but  we prefer it in smaller doses; too much becomes cloying and suffocating.<br />The Country of the Pointed Firs is a comforting place to visit--try it with a big mug of tea by your  side--but it's not a place you'd want to live.<br />GRADE: Bsit but like it would prove stultifying to the human spirit, the longing to discover and to achieve, the  desire of the young to create their own place in the world rather than to simply assume a bequeathed  place in their parent's.

In fact, his influence is so subtle, that you may not even know who he was; but I  guarantee, you do know him.  Jean Shepherd is the narrator of, and the stories from this book are the  basis for, the instant classic yuletide movie, A Christmas Story.<br />Most of the episodes from the film are here, including, of course, the Red Ryder BB Gun Saga, the  Leg Lamp Incident, The F Word Debacle, etc. and Shepherd's contribution to our collective psyche is  that we remember both these events and similar events from our own childhoods in Capital Letters  now.  In the same way, and at the same time, as Tom Wolfe was getting us to think, not of radical chic  and the right stuff, but of Radical Chic! and The Right Stuff!, Shepherd was likewise taking the  seemingly common stuff of boyhood memory and elevating it to mythic status.  So for most of us,  when we look back into the mists of memory, we don't simply recall &quot;the time we broke the window&quot;,  rather we summon forth &quot;The Broken Window Incident&quot;.  At least, I know I do.<br />Read the paragraphs below &amp; see if you haven't subconsciously internalized the cadences, impossibly  graphic immediacy and recall, mild exaggerations for comedic effect and epic tone in your own  recollections:<br />First on getting ready to leave the house in Winter:  Preparing to go to school was like getting ready for extended Deep-Sea Diving.  Longjohns,  corduroy knickers, checkered flannel Lumberjack shirt, four sweaters, fleece-lined leatherette  sheepskin, helmet, goggles, mittens with leatherette gauntlets and a large red star with an Indian  Chief's face in the middle, three pairs of sox, high-tops, overshoes, and a sixteen foot scarf wound  spirally from left to right until only the faint glint of two eyes peering out of a mound of moving  clothing told you that a kid was in the neighborhood.<br />  There was no question of staying home.  It never entered anyone's mind.  It was a hardier time, and  Miss Bodkin was a hardier teacher than the present breed.  Cold was something that was accepted,  like air, clouds, and parents; a fact of Nature, and as such could not be used in any fraudulent  scheme to stay out of school.<br />  My mother would simply throw her shoulder against the front door, pushing back the advancing  drifts and stone ice, the wind raking the living-room rug with angry fury for an instant, and we  would be launched, one after the other, my brother and I, like astronauts into unfriendly Arctic  space.  The door clanged shut behind us and that was it.  It was make school or die!<br />  Scattered out over the icy waste around us could be seen other tiny befurred jots of wind-driven  humanity.  All painfully toiling toward the Warren G. Harding School, miles away over the tundra,  waddling under the weight of frost-covered clothing like tiny frozen bowling balls with feet.  An  occasional piteous whimper could be heard faintly, but lost instantly in the sigh of the eternal wind.  All of us were bound for geography lessons involving the exports of Peru, reading lessons dealing  with fat cats and dogs named Jack.  But over it all like a faint, thin, offstage chorus was the  building  excitement.  Christmas was on its way.  Each day was more exciting than the last, because  Christmas was one day closer.  Lovely, beautiful, glorious Christmas, around which the entire year  revolved.<br />Then on being given a writing assignment while in the grip of BB-gun mania:  Miss Bodkin, after recess, addressed us:<br />  &quot;I want all of you to write a theme. ...&quot;<br />  A theme!  A rotten theme before Christmas!  There must be kids somewhere who love writing  themes, but to a normal air-breathing human kid, writing themes is a torture that ranks with the  dreaded medieval chin-breaker of Inquisitional fame.  A theme!<br />  &quot;...entitled 'What I want for Christmas,'&quot; she concluded.<br />  The clouds lifted.  I saw a faint gleam of light at the other end of the black cave of gloom which  had  enveloped me since me visit to Santa.  Rarely had the words poured from my penny pencil with  such feverish fluidity.  Here was a theme on a subject that needed talking about if ever one did!  I  remember to this day its glorious winged phrases and concise imagery:<br />  What I want for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock and this thing that  tells time.  I think everybody should have a Red Ryder BB gun.  They are very good for  Christmas.  I don't think a football is a very good Christmas present.<br />And, of course, back comes the response from Miss Bodkin:<br />  &quot;You'll shoot your eye out.  Merry Christmas.&quot;<br />At any rate, if you've never read Jean Shepherd before, or tragically never got to hear his radio show  or see his PBS series, I urge you to give this hilarious book a try.<br />Grade: Ang human kid, writing themes is a torture that ranks with the     dreaded medieval chin-breaker of Inquisitional fame.

In Leftist hindsight, the Indians have been converted into pastoral New Age environmentalists, facing off against a militaristic, technological behemoth.  The novel The Searchers, basis for the great John Ford/John Wayne movie (The Searchers--1956), offers a necessary antidote to such fuzzy headed platitudinous twaddle.<br />The story begins in 1868 Texas; neglected by the military during the Civil War and now subject to the naive Quaker administration of Indian affairs, white settlements are being rolled back by persistent murderous Comanche raids.  Living at the very edge of civilization are Henry and Martha Edwards and their children, Lucy, Debbie, Ben and Hunter.  The couple are assisted by the young man , Martin Pauley, who they virtually adopted when Comanches slaughtered his family, and by Henry's brother Amos, a quiet, taciturn man who seems to be irresistibly drawn back to the ranch time and again.  But then one day Marty and Amos are lured away from the ranch when a Comanche party steals a herd of cattle. They pursue them for quite a distance before realizing that they have been tricked.  By the time they arrive back at the Edwards ranch, it is in ruins, the parents and the boys are dead and scalped and the girls are missing.  As every movie viewer knows, what ensues is a years long quest by Martin and Amos (Ethan in the movie) as they search for the girls.<br />Martin is driven by a memory of how he ignored Debbie on her last day of life, Amos appears to be driven by darker demons.  Eventually, Martin has an epiphany:<br />  Amos, Mart realized, no longer believed they would recover Lucy alive--and wasn't thinking of  Debbie at all.  Seeing Amos' face as it was tonight, Mart remembered it as it was that worst time of  the world, when Martha lay in the box they had made for her.  Her face looked young and serene,  and her crossed hands were at rest.  They were worn hands, betraying Martha's age as her face did  not, with little random scars on them.  Martha was always hurting her hands.  Mart thought, &quot;She  wore them out, she hurt them, working for us.&quot;<br />  As he thought that, the key to Amos' life suddenly became plain.  All his uncertainties, his deadlocks  with himself, his labors without pay, his perpetual gravitation back to his brother's ranch--they all  fell into line.  As he saw what had shaped and twisted Amos' life, Mart felt shaken up; he had lived  with Amos most of his life without ever suspecting the truth.  But neither had Henry suspected  it--and Martha least of all.<br />  Amos was--had always been--in love with his brother's wife.<br />At first they are accompanied by Lucy's fianc&eacute;, but when he thinks that he has spied Lucy dancing around a fire in the Comanche camp, Amos brutally explains that what he's actually seen is a young buck wearing her scalp.  The young man, driven mad, attacks the camp and is killed.  From there on, Amos and Martin have only each other and Martin increasingly realizes that they do not share the same obsessions:<br />  Mart had noticed that Amos always spoke of catching up to &quot;them&quot;--never of finding &quot;her.&quot;  And  the cold, banked fires behind Amos' eyes were manifestly the lights of hatred, not of concern for a  lost girl.  He wondered uneasily if there might not be a peculiar danger in this.  He believed now that  Amos, in certain moods, would ride past the child and let her be lost to them if he saw a chance to  kill Comanches.<br />In the coming years they survive Indian attacks, blizzards, comic misadventures, robbery attempts and the like as their search narrows in on Scar, a chief of the Wolf Clan.  Along the way, Amos develops a grudging respect for Martin (even making him his heir) and the two become the stuff of legend, known to the Indians as &quot;Bull Shoulders&quot; (Amos) and &quot;The Other&quot; (Marty).<br />This is historical fiction in the grand manor, combining an exciting story and extensive historical background to create the kind of mythos that is central to a nation's understanding of itself.  What emerges is a more balanced sense of how precarious a situation these early white homesteaders faced as they pushed into Indian territory and, while not justifying racial hatred, it makes the animus between the races more understandable.  This is a great American story, with an obvious debt to Moby Dick (Amos/Ahab, Marty/Ishmael, Scar/Moby); the movie will always preserve our memory of the tale, but it deserves to be read too.<br />GRADE: A+and the like as their search narrows in on Scar, a chief of the Wolf Clan.

Most importantly, Amber Spring runs through her property and so she controls the water supply that makes possible the rolling fields of purple sage.  But now the Mormon church wants to gain contol of the spring by forcing an unwilling Jane to marry Elder Tull.  They've been steadily increasing the pressure on her and as the novel opens, Tull and his henchmen have come to arrest Venters, the Gentile foreman on her ranch.  Outnumbered and outgunned, Jane prays for deliverance.  Just as Tull is about to whip Venters, a rider in black appears--Lassiter, the scourge of the Mormons.<br />Lassiter is an archetype of the mythic Western hero.

Both of these themes are brought together in the &quot;Last Stand&quot; legend, which is the central fable of the industrial or 'revised' Myth of the Frontier.&quot;  Slotkin proceeds to trace the impact and the changing understanding of the Frontier Myth from King Phillip's War to 1890, when Frederick Jackson Turner declared the Frontier closed.  He maintains that over this period of time the hero of the myth evolved from an agrarian/frontiersman/hunter to a soldier-aristocrat, because that was what industrial capitalism required.<br />Of course, this thesis begs several questions: Does Custer as culmination of the myth of the industrial captain make any sense?  He was, after all, suckered and slaughtered by a pack of illiterate barbarians, are we to believe that the overlords of Capitalism wanted to be seen as incompetent fops?  Also, why does Sitting Bull emerge as an American legend too?  Shouldn't we expect him to be remembered as some kind of monster, rather than as a noble savage?<br />The reason that Slotkin can not, or does not, answer these questions, is because his book is a work of ideology as much as of history.  He wanted to vilify Capitalism and 19th century robber barons and so, he finds primary sources to support his view.  But does the fact that a few novels or newspapers treated the Last stand in the manner that he hoped they had actually prove anything?  How do we know what kind of influence these contemporary writings had &amp; did they really outweigh the opposing presentations in other periodicals and novels?  And what explains the image that comes down to us in films like She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, where Custer is portrayed as a blindly obstinate fanatic, largely responsible for his own death?  Had Capitalism lost the need for it's own myths?  It hardly seems likely.<br />In the end, Slotkin's book should be read for the panoramic sweep it offers of Frontier history and for the provocative, albeit inaccurate, theories that it offers up.

Each of them has, I fear, suffered a horrible fate: they are so familiar to us, in their  many modern incarnations &amp; imitations, that too few people return to the original texts.  This may be  particularly true of Frankenstein, whose portrayals have been so frivolous and distorted.  In fact, in  addition to being written in luxuriant gothic prose, the original novel is one of the most profound  meditations on Man and his purpose and relation to God that has exists in our literature.<br />Victor Frankenstein is a young man of Geneva who is fascinated by the sciences and the secrets of  life  and death:<br />  My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my  temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager  desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately.  I confess that  neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the  politics of various states possessed attractions for me.  It was the secrets of  heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward  substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man  that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in  its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.<br />While at University in Ingolstadt, his life course is set when he hears a professor lecture on modern  chemistry:<br />  'The ancient teachers of this science,'said he, 'promised impossibilities and  performed nothing.  The modern masters promise very little; they know that  metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera.  But these  philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to  pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.  They  penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her  hiding-places.  They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood  circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.  They have acquired new and  almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heavens, mimic the  earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.'<br />  Such were the professor's words--rather let me say such were the words of the  fate--enounced to destroy me.<br />Victor goes on to discover, through the study of chemistry, the secret of bringing dead flesh to life.  Inevitably he tests his discovery and of viewing his creation cries:<br />How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such  infinite pains and care I had endeavored to form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected  his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles  and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness;  but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of  the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and  straight black lips.<br />And so, repelled by the mere appearance, the inevitable imperfection, of his work, Frankenstein  rejects the creature utterly.  However, unlike the mute stupid monster of the movies, Shelley's monster  is articulate and sensitive and longs for companionship, but all of humankind reacts to him with  horror.  And so he demands that Frankenstein build him a mate.  When Frankenstein refuses to  provide him with a companion, the creature resolves to destroy those who Frankenstein loves.<br />Finally, Frankenstein determines that he must destroy the creature and pursues him into the frozen  wastes of the North.<br />It all makes for a rousing adventure, butthere is much more here.  Frankenstein, through his work,  has attempted to become a god, but his creation is a horrible disappointment &amp; so, is banished from  him.  Meanwhile, his flawed creation, filled with ineffable longing and confusion, wanders in exile  seeking the meaning of his existence.  And what is the impulse that he settles upon, but another act of  creation; a mate must be created for him.  The Biblical parallels are obvious, but they work on us  subtly as we read the novel.  In the end, the uncontrollable urge to create, to imitate God, stands  revealed as Man's driving force.  And the inevitable disappointment of the creator in his creation, is  revealed as the serpent in the garden.<br />If you've never read this book, read it now.  If you've read it before, read it again.<br />GRADE: A+using adventure, but there is much more here.

But in the Judd household, we recall her as the author of the bathetic  yuletide classic The Birds' Christmas Carol.<br />The brief novella tells the story of Carol Bird, a sickly little rich girl born on Christmas Eve.  An  impossibly good and generous child, she is inevitably doomed:<br />  &quot;Dear heart,&quot; said Mr. Bird, pacing up and down the library  floor, &quot;it is no use to shut our eyes to it any longer; Carol  will never be well again.  It almost seems as if I could not bear  it when I think of that loveliest child doomed to lie there day  after day, and, what is still more, to suffer pain that we are  helpless to keep away from her.  Merry Christmas, indeed; it  gets to be the saddest day in the year to me!&quot; and poor Mr. Bird  sank into a chair by the table, and buried his face in his hands,  to keep his wife from seeing the tears that would come in spite  of all his efforts.  &quot;But, Donald, dear,&quot; said sweet Mrs. Bird,  with trembling voice, &quot;Christmas day may not be so merry with us  as it used, but it is very happy, and that is better, and very  blessed, and that is better yet.  I suffer chiefly for Carol's  sake, but I have almost given up being sorrowful for my own.  I  am too happy in the child, and I see too clearly what she has  done for us and for our boys.&quot;<br />  &quot;That's true, bless her sweet heart,&quot; said Mr. Bird; &quot;she has  been better than a daily sermon in the house ever since she was  born, and especially since she was taken ill.&quot;<br />  &quot;Yes, Donald and Paul and Hugh were three strong, willful,  boisterous boys, but you seldom see such tenderness, devotion,  thought for others and self-denial in lads of their years.  A  quarrel or a hot word is almost unknown in this house.  Why?  Carol would hear it, and it would distress her, she is so full of  love and goodness.  The boys study with all their might and main.<br />  Why?  Partly, at least, because they like to teach Carol, and  amuse her by telling her what they read.  When the seamstress  comes, she likes to sew in Miss Carol's room, because there she  forgets her own troubles, which, Heaven knows, are sore enough!  And as for me, Donald, I am a better woman every day for Carol's  sake; I have to be her eyes, ears, feet, hands--her strength, her  hope; and she, my own little child, is my example!&quot;<br />  &quot;I was wrong, dear heart,&quot; said Mr. Bird more cheerfully; &quot;we  will try not to repine, but to rejoice instead, that we have an  'angel of the house' like Carol.&quot;<br />  &quot;And as for her future,&quot; Mrs. Bird went on, &quot;I think we need not  be over-anxious.  I feel as if she did not belong altogether to  us, and when she has done what God sent her for, He will take her  back to Himself--and it may not be very long!&quot;  Here it was poor  Mrs. Bird's turn to break down, and Mr. Bird's turn to comfort  her.<br />Having reformed her family, Carol determines to help out the poor but numerous Ruggles children  who live in the carriage house outside her window.  To this end she plans a Christmas Party for them  and sacrifices her own gifts in order to buy them presents.  But after this happiest day of her life, she  passes away in her sleep as the strains of a neighboring church choir waft through her window.  The  Ruggles children are mortified that they may have caused her death:<br />  Sadness reigned, it is true, in the little house behind the  garden; and one day poor Sarah Maud, with a courage born of  despair, threw on her hood and shawl, walked straight to a  certain house a mile away, dashed up the marble steps and into  good Dr. Bartol's office, falling at his feet as she cried, &quot;Oh,  sir, it was me an' our childern that went to Miss Carol's last  dinner party, an' if we made her worse we can't never be happy  again!&quot;  Then thekind old gentleman took her rough hand in his  and told her to dry her tears, for neither she nor any of her  flock had hastened Carol's flight--indeed, he said that had it  not been for the strong hopes and wishes that filled her tired  heart, she could not have stayed long enough to keep that last  merry Christmas with her dear ones.<br />  And so the old years, fraught with memories, die, one after  another, and the new years, bright with hopes, are born to take  their places; but Carol lives again in every chime of Christmas  bells that peal glad tidings and in every Christmas anthem sung  by childish voices.<br />I fondly recall my Mother sobbing through this chapter as Jeff Farris, one of the neighborhood kids  who basically lived at our house, asked plaintively, &quot;Are you going to stop crying long enough to  finish this?  I'll never find out what happened.&quot;  (NB: Here's a special visual aid--to imagine this scene  in your head, simply picture a small gang of urchins in a rice paddie surrounding a woman on the  verge of a breakdown )<br />I don't know that I'd go as far as my Mom (see her review) and say that every holiday requires a  sobfest, but it doesn't hurt for those of us with health and plenty to be reminded that we are pretty  lucky.  And even a certified curmudgeon like me still gets his heart strings tugged by this little  tearjerker.<br />GRADE: B+n' our childern that went to Miss Carol's last     dinner party, an' if we made her worse we can't never be happy     again!&quot;  Then the kind old gentleman took her rough hand in his     and told her to dry her tears, for neither she nor any of her     flock had hastened Carol's flight--indeed, he said that had it     not been for the strong hopes and wishes that filled her tired     heart, she could not have stayed long enough to keep that last     merry Christmas with her dear ones.<br />    And so the old years, fraught with memories, die, one after     another, and the new years, bright with hopes, are born to take     their places; but Carol lives again in every chime of Christmas     bells that peal glad tidings and in every Christmas anthem sung     by childish voices.<br />I fondly recall my Mother sobbing through this chapter as Jeff Farris, one of the neighborhood kids  who basically lived at our house, asked plaintively, &quot;Are you going to stop crying long enough to  finish this?

The first of these, Buffalo Soldiers, begins with Congress creating the first black peacetime units in 1866.  Augustus Sharps is a black man who, despite the Civil War, has been held as a virtual slave by a white hunter who purchased him from Indians.  Freed by men of the 10th Calvary, Augustus, who is already an expert shot, joins up and spends most his life in the U.S. Army, then joins Buffalo Bill's Wild West show after fighting with the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill.  The novel closes with America's entry into WWI, Augustus is too old to serve by then, but as his two sons head off to war, he presents them with his battle saber.<br />While one admires Willard's effort to recover the memory of the black heroes who served America so ably and with so little reward in the years before the nation desegregated, the story is ultimately more earnest than interesting.  I'd give it a mild recommendation.  A formulaic rehash of classic Western themes, redeemed only by the reminder that blacks played an important and underappreciated role in creating the American West.<br />GRADE: C	2000-12-18

In a successful effort to demonstrate that radical feminists  have betrayed the concerns of the vast majority of women, she does a great job of reporting horror  stories from the gender wars, but she is not as good at analyzing the ideology that is causing them.  When she's done, her target has certainly been destroyed, but there's not much meat left for us to chew  on.<br />Her basic thesis is inarguable: the &quot;First Wave&quot; of feminism was based on the idea of equity, that  women should have equal opportunity to succeed in society; but the &quot;Second Wave&quot; of feminism is  based on a fight against men and an imaginary patriarchy bent on subjugating women.  Unfortunately,  the book consists almost exclusively of presenting anecdotes to demonstrate that the second half of this  thesis is accurate.  Whereas, if only Ms Hoff Sommers had taken the time to examine her own  argument and place it in a broader historical and philosophical context, she could have both obviated  the need for presenting quite so much detailed proof and taken advantage of the powerful preexisting  critiques of this same tendency in other groups.<br />The transition she identifies is after all nothing more than the common historical movement by  disadvantaged interest groups from a demand for equality of opportunity to a demand for equality of  results.  The Second Wave feminists, or gender feminists as she refers to them, are simply your garden  variety radical egalitarians.  Their ideas are nothing new--they are borrowed from Marxists and Black  activists and others--all that has changed is who gets grouped in the victim class (in this case it's  women rather than proletarians or people of color) and who gets grouped in the oppressor class (men  instead of the bourgeoisie or whites).  The solution offered by the gender feminists is nothing new  either; when equality of opportunity fails to produce equal results, egalitarians only have one recourse  and that is to place restrictions on those who are succeeding in the existing system.<br />Egalitarians are always coercive utopians.  Having determined an ideal set of outcomes, but unable to  produce them in the rough and tumble of the free market, they resort to limitations on certain  individuals and classes, and to privileges for others, as the only means to reach their cherished goal.  It  is hardly surprising that some 100 years into the era of women's rights, the most radical fringe element  of the women's movement should have reached this stage.<br />This book offers an important portrait of the real life effects that these feminists and their authoritarian  tactics are having, particularly in American schools.  The litany of abuses which these activists have  perpetrated should serve as a wake up call to anyone who is concerned about the decline of the  educational system and who believes in freedom of expression, in basic civil rights, in equality of  opportunity and, ultimately, in the future of women specifically and society in general.  One can only  wish that the author had drawn back a little from her passionate but parochial concern with gender  feminism and integrated her argument into the much wider ongoing struggle against coercive  egalitarians everywhere.<br />GRADE: B-ng new  either; when equality of opportunity fails to produce equal results, egalitarians only have one recourse  and that is to place restrictions on those who are succeeding in the existing system.<br />Egalitarians are always coercive utopians.

In  fact, I liked the book very much and think it belongs right up there with Bonfire of the Vanities and  Bright Lights, Big City on the short list of really perceptive social novels of the 80's.<br />Hildon and Maureen are a quintessential yuppie couple who have moved to Vermont where Hildon  publishes Country Daze, a sort of rustic Spy magazine for the New Yorkers who summer in the  Green Mountains.  Hildon has been carrying on an affair with Lucy Spenser since they were in  college; Lucy now writes a spoof advice column for the magazine under the pseudonym of Cindi  Coeur.  Meanwhile, Lucy has just been jilted by her longtime lover, Les Whitehall, and now her 14  year old TV star niece, Nicole Nelson, has come for a visit while the mother runs off with a 24 year  old tennis pro.  Beattie spins a savage comedy of manners out of this material.  It is both genuinely  funny, here's one of Cindi Couer's columns:<br />  Dear Cindi Couer,  I understand that small children often exaggerate without thinking of it as  a lie.  My question is about my son, who has been complaining that his best  friend has better lunches than he has.  He says that instead of bringing tuna  fish sandwiches to school, the boy has a whole tuna. I told him that this was  not possible, because  a real tuna fish would weigh hundreds of pounds.  Nevertheless, my son refuses to eat tuna fish sandwiches anymore, and I feel  that tuna sandwiches are better for him than the protein found in the only  other sandwich he will eat - pork chop.  I am also worried about his telling  lies.  He refuses to admit that he has made up the story about the tuna.  I  have questioned him in detail about how this would be possible, and he just  continues the lie.  He says the boy does not bring the sandwiches in a lunch  box, but in a box the size of a bed.  Should I discipline him, or just pack  tuna sandwiches and insist that he face reality and eat them?  A Worried Mom<br />  Dear Worried,  It seems to me that you have quite a few options.  You could refuse to  replace the tuna sandwiches with sandwiches made of pork chops, and  substitute something such as quiche, which will get soggy and appeal to no  child.  You could also get a pig and put it in a cage, telling your son that  this way he would have something to rival his friend's tuna fish, and that it  is his problem to get it to school.  You might also consider the possibility  that the other boy is being forced to eat sardine sandwiches and is trying to  compensate for his own embarrassment by insisting that they are tuna fish.  You may want to ask yourself what your son is missing sat home that makes him  have such a strong empathetic reaction with the other boy.  You might also  consider the possibility that one or both boys needs glasses.<br />and devastatingly accurate in its depiction of the emptiness behind the facade of modern love.<br />Everything is surfaces here.  People assume roles and pass themselves off as something they are not,  the New Yorkers have created a Potemkin Village version of Vermont so that they can pretend to be  countrified, folks sign letters Love Always as if it meant Sincerely--and it turns out that it means little  more than that for most of them.  Everyone is so artificial and their lives so transient that they do not  really love one another, not husbands and wives, not mothers and daughters, not longtime companions,  not adulterous couples.  Their lives are summed up in the title of Nicole's soap opera, &quot;Passionate  Intensity&quot;--which is taken from William Butler Yeats' Second Coming: The best lack all conviction  and the worst are full of passionate intensity.  Love has been replaced by passion; relationships have  replaced true commitments.<br />And so ends the Baby Boomer generation, depthless, childess, loveless &amp; artificial, they are completely  atomized.  And lest one hold out hope for the next generation, Nicole explains to her aunt that noone  has friends anymore, that people sleep together because they are supposed to, and when her aunt asks if  she has a &quot;fave rave&quot;, responds that it's not cool to like a boy that much anymore.  As Hildon says of  her:<br />  She needs an education.  She ought to have a tutor or something.  She's never learned anything.<br />  She knows lyrics to songs and she knows what people are talking about if they say something dirty  and she knows who's who on television.  She doesn't know anything about the world.<br />Lucy's generation had, at least, been exposed to and then rejected Western Civilization, American  ideals and Judeo-Christian morality.  The generation to come is simply being raised in a moral and  ethical vaccum and, since nature abhors a vaccum, mass media and pop culture are rushing in to fill  the empty space.  Beattie amply demonstrates the emptiness of the lives that these people lead and the  malignancy of the culture that they have created.<br />Reading the book, I was struck by how hard it would be for someone to relate to much of it in thirty  years.  Many references are already dated: Betamax, Cabbage Patch Kids, Bess Myerson, etc., and  hopefully, the people themselves will seem like artifacts by then.  Having just read several of the great  satires from earlier in the Century (Aldous Huxley's Point Counter Point, Anthony Powell's Dance to  the Music of Time, Evelyn Waugh's Handful of Dust), it became obvious that, even if the authors had  captured the Zeitgeist perfectly, it is very hard for the modern reader to pick up on all the in jokes and  to feel the bite of the satire as their contemporaries must have felt it.

After dinner on long summer nights, he would sit  beside me in our small enclosed porch to hear my account of that day's Brooklyn  Dodger game....By the time I had mastered the art of scorekeeping, a lasting  bond had been forged among my father, baseball, and me.<br />So begins Doris Kearns Goodwin's enchanting memoir of growing up in Rockville Centre, L.I. and the  relationship she forged with her bank examiner father, Michael Francis Aloysius Kearns, through  baseball. As she continues, she explains how this experience contributed to her becoming a historian:<br />  Through my knowledge, I commanded my father's undivided attention, the sign of his love. It  would instill in me an early awareness of the power of narrative, which would introduce a lifetime  of storytelling, fueled by the naive confidence that others would find me as entertaining as my  father did.<br />Goodwin is, of course, best known for her hagiographies of democrat Presidents &amp; her frequent appearances on The Newshour, Imus and Hardball, but when Ken Burns tabbed her as a talking head for his Baseball series, she found that people at her talks were more interested in reminiscing about the Dodgers than in hearing about the Roosevelts. The result is &quot;Wait Till Next Year&quot;, wherein she has interwoven her baseball memories with her recollections of growing up Catholic in post-War suburban America.<br />I especially liked several of her anecdotes:<br />(1) She tells about her first confession, where she tearfully confesses to praying that Allie Reynolds, Robin Roberts and others will be injured, though not seriously, just enough so they won't be able to play against the Dodgers<br />(2) After winning a St. Christopher's medal (blessed by the Pope) in a catechism contest, she presents it to a slumping Gil Hodges, who accepts it reverently &amp; tells her how he had one just like it growing up but gave it to his coal miner father to protect him.<br />At a time when each memoir is more sensational than the next, fueling a descending spiral of confessional aberrance, it was a real pleasure to read the story of a nice normal American upbringing in a loving family &amp; one can't help but feel that we lost something valuable with the passing of the world she describes.<br />GRADE: B+ad one just like it growing up but gave it to his coal miner father to protect him.<br />At a time when each memoir is more sensational than the next, fueling a descending spiral of confessional aberrance, it was a real pleasure to read the story of a nice normal American upbringing in a loving family &amp; one can't help but feel that we lost something valuable with the passing of the world she describes.<br />GRADE: B+	2000-12-18

As it turns out, that was a colossal mistake on my part.  This little book contains more interesting and  compelling thoughts on the nature of human relationships, particularly the marriage relationship, than  just about any other book I've ever read.<br />It's not possible to address them all here, but here are two ideas that I found particularly striking.  Here  is a passage describing a quality marriage:<br />  A good relationship has a pattern like a dance, and is built on some of the same rules. The partners  do not need to hold on tightly, because they move confidently in the same pattern, intricate but gay  and swift and free, like a country dance of Mozart's. To touch heavily would be to arrest the pattern  and freeze the movement, to check the endlessly changing beauty of its unfolding. There is no place  here for the possessive clutch, the clinging arm, the heavy hand, only the barest touch is assign.  Now arm in arm, now face to face, now back to back - it does not matter which. Because they know  they are partners moving to the same rhythm, creating a pattern together, and being invisibly  nourished by it.  The joy of such a pattern is not only the joy of creation or the joy of participation,  it is also the joy of living in the moment. Lightness of touch and living in the moment are  intertwined.<br />  When you love someone, you do not love them all the time, in exactly the same way, from moment  to moment. It is an impossibility. It is even a lie to pretend to. And yet this is exactly what most of  us demand.  We have so little faith in the ebb and flow of life, of love, of relationships. We leap at  the flow of the tide and resist in terror its ebb. We are afraid it will never return. We insist on  permanency, on duration, on continuity; when the only continuity possible, in life as in love, is in  growth, in fluidity - in freedom, in the sense that the dancers are free, barely touching as they pass,  but partners in the same pattern.<br />  The only real security is not in owning or possessing, not in demanding or expecting, not in hoping,  even.  Security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what was in nostalgia, nor forward  to what it might be in dread or anticipation, but living in the present relationship and accepting it as  it is now. Relationships must be like islands, one must accept them for what they are here and now,  within their limits - islands, surrounded and interrupted by the sea, and continually visited and  abandoned by the tides.<br />This image, of a loving couple as partners in a dance, not gripped in a hammer lock, but tracing a  unified pattern via different steps, just seems profound to me.  We all know people who demand of  love that it be unchanging, or demand of a partner that they do things in lockstep; these people are  never happy and we immediately recognize their relationships as unhealthy.  At the same time, we  recognize the good marriages around us as the ones where each partner is confident enough in the  other to have faith that their separate paths will remain intertwined and will lead to the same place.<br />The other section that truly brought about a personal epiphany, was when she says:<br />  ...marriage, which is always spoken of as a bond, becomes actually, in this stage, many bonds,  many strands, of different texture and strength, making up a web that is taut and firm.  The web is  fashioned of love.  Yes, but many kinds of love:  romantic love first, then a slow-growing devotion  and, playing through these, a constantly rippling companionship.  It is made of loyalties, and  interdependencies, and shared experiences.  It is woven of memories of meetings and conflicts; of  triumphs and disappointments.  It is a web of communication, a common language, and the  acceptance of lack of language, too; a knowledge of likes and dislikes, of habits and reactions, both  physical and mental.  It is a web of instincts and intuitions, and known and unknown exchanges.  The web of marriage is made by propinquity, in the day to day living side by side, looking outward  and working outward in the same direction.<br />As I read that, I was reminded of some of the marriages i've never been able to fathom, from my own  grandparents to that most analyzed relationship of our day, the Clintons.  The notion of the years  together creating a web and of reaching a point where you, the couple, are within, looking out in the  same direction, seems to me to go a long way to explaining such marriages.  Think of how completely  the Clintons are entangled within their own unique web, how insular their world must be, and, so long  as they do work in the same direction, their relationship at least starts to make a little sense.<br />There is much more here besides.  I approached with trepidation, fearing a chick book, and found  instead a marvelous exploration of the human condition in general and of the extraordinarily complex nature of marriage in particular.  It is a book that anyone will benefit by, especially actual or  prospective husbands and wives.<br />GRADE: A+s; of     triumphs and disappointments.

Louis L'Amour is probably the best-selling Western writer of all time and Hondo his first big, and perhaps his best, novel.  It is reminiscent of Shane (see Orrin's review) and Riders of the Purple Sage (see Orrin's review), but with Apaches on the warpath taking the place of hostile cattle ranchers or intolerant Mormons.  Hondo Lane is the gun fighter, Army dispatch rider, hero who, along with his feral but loyal dog Sam,  meets Angie Lowe and her young son Johnny who are homesteading in Apache territory in late 1800's Arizona.  Angie has been abandoned by her low down snake of a husband, but refuses to leave her land.  Hondo must ride back to the Fort to warn the Cavalry that the Apache chief Vittoro is on the move, but then returns to help defend woman and child.<br />If the story does not quite reach the lofty literary heights of Shane--perhaps because the focus is so much on what Hondo needs from Angie and Johnny, as opposed to the way in which Shane was the object of the Starrett family's affection--it is still quite enjoyable.  Three elements that really stand out and offer a contrast to the easy caricature of the genre are the respectful portrayal of the Apaches, the centrality of the romance angle to the story and the blithe depiction of the difficulty and brutality of frontier life.  Even in so formulaic a tale as this one, the American Western demonstrates a level of maturity and nuance that critics seem bent on denying.<br />With the possible exception of the romance novel, there is perhaps no other genre of fiction which the critics and academia take less seriously than the Western.  But consider the fact that by the time of his death L'Amour had sold over 200 million books and among his avid legion of readers were two of the most decent men ever to become U.S. Presidents, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.  It seems to me that the failure of the intelligentsia to reckon with Western reflects poorly on themselves, rather than on the literature.  L'Amour says at one point:<br />  No man knows the hour of his ending, nor can he choose the place or the manner of his going.  To  each it is given to die proudly, to die well, and this is, indeed, the final measure of the man.<br />It is easy, too easy, to dismiss the ethos of the Western as a kind of macho posturing.  But those lines and the general &quot;code of the West&quot;, however much it may be a fictional construct, reflect a concern with reputation which, when observed, has had a salutary effect on men.  In an excellent essay on &quot;The Greatness of George Washington&quot;  (Virginia Quarterly Review, Volume 68, Number 2) historian Gordon S. Wood traces Washington's greatness and his stature among his peers to what our generation would perceive as an overweening concern for his own reputation.  But this same zealous regard for his own name and place in history motivated Washington to lead a life of exemplary moral rectitude and he created in himself the ideal man to lead a nascent and fragile democracy, a man capable of resisting the temptations of power because reputation was more important to him.  It is no surprise then to find that two of the only other presidents we've had who can even approach him in stature immersed themselves in this idealistic and rigidly moralistic fiction.  God knows what Bill Clinton reads (actually one book we know he enjoyed is Vox by Nicholson Baker, see Orrin's review), but rest assured, it ain't Louis L'Amour<br />GRADE: A-e failure of the intelligentsia to reckon with Western reflects poorly on themselves, rather than on the literature.

I already know who I am.<br />Edward Abbey is one of the patron saints of the modern Environmental movement; right up there with Rachel Carson.  Desert Solitaire, his memoir of working in a National Park, is an impassioned statement of preservationist principles and his comic novel, The Monkey Wrench Gang, is a virtual primer for ecoterrorism.  But my personal favorite of his books is the little remembered Brave Cowboy, the basis for the excellent but equally forgotten Kirk Douglas film, Lonely Are the Brave.  It belongs on the shelf with the other uniquely American paens to independence and rugged individualism:  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest(read Orrin's review), Cool Hand Luke, From Here to Eternity  (read Orrin's review), All the Pretty Horses  (read Orrin's review), etc.<br />Set in the mid 1950's, the novel tells the story of Jack Burns, a latter day cowboy, now reduced to working as a hand on a sheep ranch, who gets himself thrown into prison so that he can help his draft dodging friend escape.  But when his buddy refuses to compromise the moral purity of his concientious objector status, Burns is forced to break out on his own, assuming that a vicious Mexican prison guard he has aggravated doesn't kill him first.  In the meantime the authorities have realized that Jack too is unregistered and that while they were in college together, he helped his friend with some radical causes, however ineffectual.  So when he does manage to escape, Jack ends up being treated as a dangerous fugitive, instead of as the fairly harmless eccentric that he is.  Pursued by locals, feds, the military and the sadistic guard,  he takes off into the desert, his only allies a high spirited horse, who's as much trouble as help, and a phlegmatic local sherriff named Morlin Johnson.<br />In a broader sense though, what the book is really about is the clash between the values of the old West and the bureaucratic, mechanized, regimented and federalized modern West.  Though it lacks the memorable set-pieces that distinguish the other books cited above and is admittedly none too subtle in portraying the menace of modern life,  it succeeds nonetheless because the character of Jack Burns evokes such nostalgia in the reader and like Don Quixote, we find the mental world that he lives in more attractive than the reality that has begun to crowd in on him.

Beilis was accused of murdering a Christian  boy, despite evidence pointing toward the boy's own mother.  After being held from 1911 to 1913, he  was finally brought to trial, where he was exonerated.<br />In this novel the protagonist is Yakov Bok, a nominally Jewish handyman (&quot;fixer&quot;)--nominally  because he has abandoned his Jewish beliefs for a Spinoza influenced kind of &quot;free thinking&quot;--leaves  his village after being cuckolded by his wife.  Eventually ending up in Kiev, he one day comes upon a  man collapsed in the street and decides to help him, despite noticing that he is wearing a Black  Hundreds pin (symbol of a vicious anti-Semitic organization).  The man, who turns out to be a local  merchant who was merely drunk, offers Yakov a job managing his brickyard, not realizing that he is  Jewish.  Yakov accepts, despite much trepidation, goes to work under an assumed name, Yakov  Ivanovitch Dologushev, and moves into an apartment in an area forbidden to Jews.<br />Once on the job he runs afoul of : the merchant's daughter, whose sexual advances he deflects; local  boys, who he he chases out of the factory yard; and the employees, who he warns about stealing  bricks.  These seemingly petty disagreements prove to have disastrous results when a local boy is  found murdered, stabbed repeatedly and drained of blood.  Yakov, who the authorities have discovered  is Jewish, is accused of committing the murder as a form of ritual killing to harvest Christian blood for  use in some imagined rites for Passover celebration :<br />  The ritual murder is meant to re-enact the crucifixion of our dear Lord.  The murder of Christian  children and the distribution of their blood among Jews are a token of their eternal enmity against  Christendom, for in murdering the innocent Christian child, they repeat the martyrdom of Christ.<br />The victim is one of the boys that Yakov had chased, and both daughter and fellow employees are only  too willing to give false testimony against him.  The initial prosecutor assigned to the case is relatively  friendly, and obviously skeptical about this theory of the case, but he does not last long.<br />His rivals and replacements try with great brutality to wring a confession from Yakov.  In part, they  are motivated by an understanding that the evidence they have against him is terribly inadequate : they  are determined to keep the case from going to trial.  Yakov, on the other hand, recognizes that he if he  can just get to a courtroom he has a chance to clear himself, and Jews generally, of this blood libel.  There follows a harrowing, years-long, battle of wills, in which Yakov takes on truly heroic  dimensions : a simple, non-political, nonbeliever, is transformed before our eyes into a powerful  symbol of resistance to anti-Semitism, injustice, tyranny and hatred.  By the end of the story he  resembles nothing so much as one of the Titans--an Atlas holding the weight of the world on his own  shoulders; a Prometheus, having his innards picked out by carrion birds every day; or a Sisyphus,  futilely pushing a boulder up a hill every day, only to have it roll back down every night.  Yakov too  seems sentenced by God to bear a punishment for all mankind, and he too bears up under it with  superhuman strength and transcendent nobility.  Superficially then it seems to resemble an  existentialist novel, but Yakov derives his strength, and the story derives its universality and its power,  from his determination to prove his innocence, a determination which would not matter to an  existentialist.<br />Through the culture-consuming hegemony of the movies, Malamud is today best remembered for The  Natural, but The Fixer is the book upon which his reputation should rest.  It is a great novel; one that  deserves a place on the shelf with the works of George Orwell, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Arthur  Koestler, and the other great novelists of the Twentieth Century whose theme was the struggle of the  individual against the machinations of the State and against the soul-destroying ideological pathologies  which undergird totalitarian states.<br />GRADE : A+tter to an  existentialist.<br />Through the culture-consuming hegemony of the movies, Malamud is today best remembered for The  Natural, but The Fixer is the book upon which his reputation should rest.

When a Russian scientist, working at a mysterious research station in Siberia, manages to  get a cryptic message to the West, it is determined that he's summoning Dr. Johnny Porter, a part  Gitksan Indian, Rhodes Scholar, anthropologist, who speaks any number of languages.  The two had  met many years earlier, and out of a sense of obligation, Porter agrees to sneak into the installation  and find out what's so important.  What follows is one of the better thrillers of the post Cold War  era, as Porter impersonating various people of Asiatic descent, while displaying extraordinary  resourcefulness at myriad tasks, penetrates deep into Russian territory and then, pursued by all of the  forces of the new Russia, strikes out across the icy barrens of the Kolymsky Region of Siberia and  the area around the Bering Straits, in a mad dash back to the States.<br />The case of Lionel Davidson is one of the strangest of any recent author.  He writes award-winning,  best sellers every few years, but I doubt more than a handful of folks remember him from one book  to the next.  In Kolymsky Heights, he combines elements of Michael Crichton, Smilla's Sense of  Snow, and Martin Cruz Smith's Arkady Renko series to produce a novel that's exciting enough in it's  own right but is even more remarkable for it's unusual hero and for the way that Davidson uses the  hostile environment, both natural and man-made.  Though a general and helicopters and Russian  troops all pursue him, the real threat to Porter is the forbidding terrain he has to cross and the deadly  weather he braves.  This is one that you'll want to read with a blanket over you and a warm mug of  something or other nearby.<br />GRADE : A	2000-12-10

Clearly whites had much to feel guilty about and  blacks properly felt aggrieved, therefore programs were passed.  But then came the riots, some  triggered by the assassination of King, and white guilt was replaced by white fear.  Then came the  confrontation over use of affirmative action programs and whites, the overwhelming majority of  whom had played no part in the oppression of blacks, were able to reclaim title to innocence.  Since  then, relations between the races have become much more problematic, with temporary flare ups of  white guilt, justified or not, after episodes like the Rodney King beating and the Mark Fuhrman  revelations, quickly replaced by white outrage after the King riots and the OJ verdict.  The general  trend though is towards a relative lack of guilt, even a lack of sympathy, on the part of whites for the  black predicament.  This trend really came to a head in the fight over Welfare Reform, passage of  which (with some Democrat support no less) would have been unthinkable just twenty years earlier.<br />The problem for blacks, as Steele points out, is that blacks have not abandoned the victims role.  &quot;Leaders&quot; like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton continue to make claims for special treatment solely on  the basis of skin color and historic bad treatment.  But their claims fall on increasingly deaf ears and  unfortunately serve to foster a corrosive atmosphere of black dependence on white largesse.  Helpless  victimhood might have some value, though it seems unlikely, if it was still at least winning financial  and political concessions from the white majority, but to continue in this beggarly posture even after  the spigot has been turned off can not be doing the black community any good.<br />One interesting newer issue to apply Steele's insight to is the movement for Reparations--compensation  to blacks for the economic costs of slavery.  I've stated previously that one reason the idea is worth  exploring is because it might help to permanently dispose of this innocence/guilt idea.  A massive cash  settlement would in all likelihood both assuage white guilt and buy off black victimhood.  This  transaction, no matter what kind of high toned language the actual process was dressed up in, would be  exactly as crass, self-serving and distasteful as it sounds here, essentially allowing white America to  repurchase the moral high ground for the modern equivalent of forty acres and a mule.  At any rate,  you can see how Shelby Steele's way of looking at our racial divide helps to illuminate such an issue  and strips away the noble facade to reveal the rather tawdry psychological moorings which really  underpin it.

A perfectly acceptable relic of its time, this book treats Hitler and the Nazi Party as  complete aberrations, imposed on a slumbering Germany by a freakish set of circumstances.  This  view, understandable in a liberal West which finds it necessary to aver &quot;it couldn't happen here&quot; and  which found it necessary to rehabilitate Germany into a worthy Cold War ally, has prevailed for the  better part of sixty years now.  In recent years however at least one book has come along to directly  challenge this view, Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's excellent Hitler's Willing Executioners.  But to my  knowledge, British historian Michael Burleigh's Third Reich is the first major one volume history to  rival Shirer's work and it is an invaluable corrective, precisely the kind of big idea contrarian history  that we could use more of and which, even if the author's claims are ultimately rejected, can serve to  clarify the thinking of us all on the issues he broaches.<br />Burleigh apparently draws on some academic work (for instance that by Saul Freidlander) with which  I'm unfamiliar, but his central argument will ring a bell with anyone who's ever read Eric Hoffer's  great book The True Believer.  Burleigh considers the Third Reich to have been the product of a  political religion, replete with symbols, hymns, liturgy, martyrs and a Messiah.  From this perspective,  the German people, defeated in WWI and impoverished by reparations and Depression, emerge, not as  unwitting dupes, but as desperate believers in a new state religion propounded by Hitler, a true  totalitarianism, suffused with racially motivated criminality,  which sought to infiltrate every aspect of  their lives.  In one of the more striking quotes in the book, one that Hoffer would have noted,  Burleigh cites Hitler favorably discussing Roman Catholicism :<br />  Be assured, we too put faith in the first place and not cognition.  One has to be able to believe in a  cause.  Only faith creates a state.  What motivates people to go and do battle and die for religious  ideas ?  Not cognition, but blind faith.<br />Over the course of the book, Burleigh demonstrates the gradual process by which the German people's  faith in Hitler and Nazism grew, supplanting their belief in Christianity and vitiating their sense of  morality.  Where Goldhagen showed the German people to have been generally amenable to Hitler's  exterminationist program, Burleigh shows them to have participated in, or at least to have acquiesced  in, a truly totalitarian program which replaced every aspect of traditional German culture and society  with Nazi beliefs.<br />This idea, of Nazism as a religion, gives the book a helpful focus and a unifying theme around which  to organize the enormous amount of information which Mr. Burleigh has assimilated and lays out  here.  In addition, where the prior treatment Hitler and Nazism as a historical exception may have  acted as a balm to our liberal sensibilities, Burleigh's treatment of them helps us both to understand  their similarity to the Soviet Union and Communism, and to understand how such movements could  rise again.  It's an excellent book, one that benefits greatly from the author's willingness to advance a  novel view and to prosecute his case forcefully.  If you've developed a palate for the sort of bland  mush that passes for popular history these days, you might find it too bracing, but if you've enjoyed  such powerful iconoclastic works as those already mentioned, or Richard Pipes's Russian Revolution,  or Niall Ferguson's Pity of War , this one's sure to appeal to you also.  It seems destined to become a  classic if only enough people with open minds are willing to read it.<br />GRADE : Anoted,  Burleigh cites Hitler favorably discussing Roman Catholicism :<br />    Be assured, we too put faith in the first place and not cognition.

In order to appease locals who are  upset about the tumult this will cause, a native Savannahian is added to the match, a war hero and  storied athlete with the unlikely name of Rannulph Junnah.  He is reluctant to take part but agrees at  the behest of his mysterious black friend, Bagger Vance, who offers to caddie for him.<br />Junnah, badly out of practice and drinking too much, has been shattered by his wartime experiences.  After the war he even visited the families of the eleven Germans he killed and married the sister of  one, though she is now deceased, and their daughter lives in Germany with her grandmother.  But  Bagger Vance's motive is not necessarily for Junnah to win the match, or even to contend, rather, he  wants to use it to teach him about life.  Specifically, he wants to demonstrate the existence of what he  refers to as the Authentic Swing and the importance of discovering it and trusting it....<br />Now, I'm as susceptible to a hokey sports story as anybody; put it in the VCR right now and I'll sit on  the edge of my seat to see who wins the big game in Hoosiers.  And I don't mind a little supernatural  mumbo jumbo; give me Shoeless Joe or Damn Yankees or Angels in the Outfiield any day.  Heck, I  don't even mind a little Eastern Philosophy thrown in--Iron and Silk, Zen in the Art of Archery, etc.  But put them all together, and offer us no surprises, and it gets a little tedious.<br />Pressfield's talent as a writer shines through--except when he slides into philosophical gobbledy  gook--and the period setting in particular is handled deftly.  But I have four very specific objections to  the novel.  First, Jones and Hagen are the two most interesting characters in the book; they're the ones  we want to know more about.  And it's simply implausible that even with God on his side some  drunken yokel would beat these two guys.<br />Second, there's one golf moment in the book which really seems too violate the spirit of all that  Pressfield has been saying about the beauty of the game and about sport in general.  After he's gotten  back into the match, Junnah's ball moves when he's addressing it and he's forced to take a penalty.  Pressfield emphasizes the honor he demonstrates in that moment, but the obvious touch here, perfectly  consistent with the sporty character he displays throughout, would be for Hagen to nudge his ball too  to even things up, with Jones then following suit.  Their willingness to take advantage of a purely  flukish happenstance against this amateur just doesn't seem sporting.<br />Third, there's a completely insipid tone of pacifism and one-world twaddle underlying certain parts of  the story.  It reaches hilarious lengths when the black student tells about a family trip to New York  City where :<br />  My dad carried us up there on Amtrak, to see the Statue of Liberty and the U.N. He wanted to show  us our legacy as Americans.<br />Huh?  The U.N.? You show me the American who thinks of that bureaucratic den of thieves and  blowhards as an integral part of our national legacy.<br />Finally though, what's most troubling is the antihuman nature of the Authentic Swing.  I really hate  the idea, common in Eastern Philosophy, that the things which we humans can achieve exist beyond  ourselves, rather than being products of our ingenuity, effort and application of the will to succeed.  We've all had those experiences when we're &quot;in the groove&quot; and something really difficult, like hitting  a golf ball, comes almost effortlessly and seemingly without thought  For that brief time, it is possible  to believe that we've tapped into something external or something primordially internal.  But to  believe this seems to me to completely underestimate ourselves and our species and I find it repellent.  The conceit here, that by tapping into the Authentic Swing this hack can beat two of the greatest  golfers who ever lived, just seems silly.  Even if such a thing existed, let's assume that Bobby Jones  was nearly always utilizing it.<br />I honestly wish I liked the book more and I think the movie could be decent, especially if they whack  the modern frame, emphasize the two real golf greats and minimize the philosophizing.  And I suppose  that if you haven't seen every old sports movie and read every classic sports book it might not seem  quite so derivative (Junnah even has a hand carved driver, like Roy Hobbes's bat Wonder Boy in The  Natural.)  As is, I can only give it the most feeble of recommendations and most of that derives from  the excellent old time atmosphere, the portrayals of Jones and Hagen and the inherent drama that even  awful sports stories have built in by the dynamic of the games.

Andrey Bely (or Biely, I've found it spelled both ways) was the pen name of Boris Nikolayevich  Bugayev.  He was a leading figure of the Symbolist movement in pre-Revolutionary Russia and, in  addition to Nabokov, influenced Boris Pasternak and Yevgeny Zamyatin, among others. St. Petersburg  is certainly as innovative as the other works Nabokov ranks it with, using characters and even  geography as allegorical symbols for ideas, and written in a nearly stream-of-consciousness prose.  But  to my very pleasant surprise, it is much more enjoyable than these other touchstones of Modernism.<br />The action of the novel, and happily there is some action, occurs over the course of two days in 1905,  when Russia, having lost the War with Japan, was wracked by strikes, conspiracy, violence and near  revolution.  Apollon Apollonovich Ableukhov is an elderly, but still devoted, Tsarist bureaucrat.  His  dilettantish son, Nikolai, who is dabbling in radical politics, has been given the task of murdering his  own father; the chosen weapon, improbably enough, a bomb in a sardine tin.  Just as the city of St.  Petersburg--Peter the Great's &quot;window on the West&quot;--represents the point where the rational West  meets the savage and mystical Orient, so this confrontation between father and son represents  impending conflict between European reason and Asiatic barbarism, and the bomb itself represents the  indiscriminately destructive forces about to be brought to bear on the decaying Tsarist state.<br />Though much of the story, inevitably in this type of modernist fiction, is obscure and barely coherent,  the literally ticking time bomb gives the story a propulsive forward momentum which speeds the  reader along and, though I'm certain I missed much of the symbolism, because the imagined clash  between the main symbols proved eerily prophetic, we can read things into the story that Biely  probably never intended.  Biely's use of language and symbolism lends an almost feverish quality to  the narrative, as if the whole thing were a particularly horrible dream.  It is a story suffused with a  sense of dread and with intimations of the chaos to come, both in the novel and in the society it  depicts.<br />I don't know that it necessarily deserves quite the elevated position that Nabokov gave it, but it was  apparently extremely influential on Russian Literature and it makes for an unusual but gratifying  reading experience.  You'll surely enjoy it more than you would the almost unreadable James Joyce  and Marcel Proust.<br />GRADE : Be the imagined clash  between the main symbols proved eerily prophetic, we can read things into the story that Biely  probably never intended.

He's the  physically and psychically devastated sole survivor of a fire fight in Vietnam, his wounds so bad that  the medic who first treated him demanded a transfer and gradually drank his own life away.  The  America that Paco returned to is profoundly disinterested in his wartime experiences.  Young people  seem not to even know about the war and older folks, like Ernest Monroe, an ex-Marine veteran of  Iwo Jima, who gives Paco a job washing dishes at his Texas Lunch diner, are more interested in telling  him their own war stories.<br />Paco is haunted by memories of Vietnam and, quite literally, by the spirits of his dead fellow  soldiers--in fact, they narrate the book.  As he tries to put together a &quot;normal&quot; life, his continual  immersion in the dishwashing sink seems to represent an attempt to wash away past sins--atrocities  committed during the war--and a kind of rebirth through baptism.  He gradually develops a strange  voyeuristic relationship with Cathy, the flirtatious niece of the owners of the Geronimo Hotel, where  he's staying.  But in the end, the dynamic between them turns out to be something very different than  what he believes it to be and as the story ends he gets back on the bus and heads out of town.<br />This isn't a bad novel by any means, and it's certainly better than Toni Morrison's Beloved, which it  rather notoriously beat out for the National Book Award, but I found that much of it simply didn't  work for me.  The unusual narrative device, of letting the dead speak, quickly loses it's charm and  becomes sort of artificial and intrusive.  It becomes especially distracting during passages where the  spirit guide renders Paco's thoughts and feelings.  The story itself is kind of an amalgam of clich&eacute;s  from the popular culture's rather deranged view of the war.  In particular, there's one scene in which  he participates in a gang rape that is purely obligatory, rather than growing organically out of the  story.  The author is a Vietnam veteran, so I'm hesitant to simply dismiss it as pandering, but one  senses that it is there because Heinemann thinks the reader expects it to be.<br />The odd narrative structure, Paco's lack of any life outside of his mundane job, and the derivative  nature of the war scenes, all serve to prevent us from feeling any connection with Paco.  Talk of  fictional personae coming to life on the page is relatively silly, but these factors continually remind us  that he's merely a character.  To a degree, we admire the inner drive that keeps him moving forward,  but we have no idea where it comes from or why he keeps on.  Ultimately, this is the only occasionally  affecting story of a survivor whose survival, though admirable in itself, fails to convey any broader  meaning to the reader.<br />GRADE : C+s purely obligatory, rather than growing organically out of the  story.

Giles Milton has taken a marvelously colorful cast of characters and a set of  intrinsically dramatic events and made of them a wonderfully readable, genuinely exciting history of  the earliest English efforts to colonize North America.<br />An accretion of myth has grown up around colonization, which at least implies that Europeans  stumbled upon bountiful lands and picked them clean at the expense of helpless native populations.  Milton's book masterfully recaptures a sense of how enormous were the risks, human and financial,  which accompanied the process.  The human risk was taken by the colonists and administrators who set  sail for a New World which Milton amply demonstrates they knew practically nothing about.  The  book charts the stuttering attempts to establish a secure foothold on the Atlantic Coast, through  episodes of shipwreck, starvation, murder, and war; ending with the uneasy truce reached between  colonists and natives when John Rolfe fell in love with and married Pocohontas, legendary daughter of  the warrior chieftain Powhatan.  Lest anyone believe that the English had an easy time of all this,  consider the moment when just fifteen men were left behind to hold the fort at Roanoke, alone amidst  an unexplored and untamed wilderness.  These men and a subsequent group of colonists famously  disappeared--the lost colony of Roanoke--though Milton offers an intriguing theory of their fate in an  Epilogue.<br />The expense of settling Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay was largely borne by Ralegh, a pampered  favorite of Queen Elizabeth.  He comes across as the one player who had a vision of what the  American colonies might become and a stubborn determination to establish them.  In Milton's  portrayal, he is the quintessential Renaissance man--courtier, poet, scientist, diplomat, soldier,  etc.--and the hero of the tale.  Ralegh made every effort in these early years to treat the natives fairly,  even making one of them, Manteo, who had been brought back to England and educated, the Lord of  Roanoke.  Ultimately his peaceful policy was abandoned, but thanks to the rising demand for the  tobacco which his minions had brought back with them his vision of a permanent colony became a  reality, though he tragically ended up on the chopping block, beheaded by James I on a dubious  accusation of treason.<br />Milton relies heavily on first hand accounts, many presented with their original chaotic spelling, and  these take some getting used to, but they do lend the tale a greater immediacy than it might otherwise  have had.  With stories of piracy, war at sea and on land, cowardice and bravery, blind luck and  vicious backstabbing, there's always plenty of action and the whole thing ends with an improbable love  story.  Never mind what you think you remember from those school days long ago; this is history at its  exciting and informative best.<br />GRADE : Aourtier, poet, scientist, diplomat, soldier,  etc.--and the hero of the tale.

2196255:US	52173832	R1ABPEH24GYBQO	0684811456	697168212	Lift Every Voice: Turning a Civil Rights Setback Into a New Vision of Social Justice	Books	2	6	37	N	N	dangerous woman abandoned by fair weather friends	In an irony that neither would be likely to appreciate much, Lani Guinier's account of being nominated  and then unnominated for the position of head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is  reminiscent of Robert Bork's Tempting of America (see Orrin's review).  Both quickly came to be  perceived more as symbols than human beings and, as such, ended up being subjected to really unfair  personal attacks and having their philosophies caricatured.  But what is really instructive about the two  cases is the differences rather than the similarities.<br />Robert Bork's nomination split the Congress and the punditry on strictly party lines and it just so  happened that the Democrats controlled the Senate at that point in time, so he went down to defeat.  However, he did get to have nomination hearings where he was questioned about his views however  ineptly by  the members of the Senate Judiciary committee.  [Personally, I learned more of value about  constitutional law by watching the hearings than I did in my law school class.]  Despite the fact that his  nomination was clearly doomed, President Reagan stood by him and insisted on putting the matter to a  vote, allowing Bork to lose honorably and granting him a sense of closure, albeit mixed with disgust, at  the end of the ugly process.  Bork later wrote his book in order to explain and amplify his views on the  constitution and the legal system and, to a lesser degree, to give his perspective on the nomination  fight.  The result is a vital and readable contribution to our understanding of the degree to which our  jurisprudence has become politicized and of the dangers it entails, as well as a resigned, but bemused,  look at the Senate by someone who ran afoul of the institution.<br />Lani Guinier's nomination, on the other hand, split the nation along racial lines, with even traditional  white allies abandoning black civil rights organizations to oppose her.  Ultimately, even Bill Clinton,  her longtime friend, repudiated his own nominee and withdrew her name before she got to the hearings  stage.  This, understandably, left Guinier frustrated and humiliated, feeling that she had been denied the  opportunity to defend her views and her own good name.  In the most affecting passages in the book,  she describes how she was about to appear on Nightline when Ted Koppel told her that the next day's  New York Times and Washington Post announced that the White House had decided to pull her name,  a fact of which she was unaware at the time.  She also describes having old pal Hillary walk right past  her at the White House with a wave and a &quot;Hey kiddo&quot;, obviously unwilling to stop and discuss the  fiasco and she details her meeting with a dewey eyed President Clinton, who moments after telling her  that the meeting was one of the most difficult of his life went before the White House press corps and  denounced her as &quot;antidemocratic&quot;.  Guinier has written another book, Tyranny of the Majority, which  I honestly haven't read, but in this book she whines on ad nauseum about how the failure of her  nomination was a catastrophe for the cause of civil rights in America.  In the strangest maneuver of the  book, she introduces herself early on as someone who was forced to write controversial articles in order  to win tenure, then laments how those views were twisted by the press and hostile politicians, then  returns at the end of the book to a defense of them as her true beliefs.  The result is an enormously  self-indulgent vanity piece, with insufficient consideration of, and a marked lack of honesty about, the  controversial theories that ultimately sank her nomination.  The book spreads more noise than light on  the issues.<br />The most serious flaw of the book, narrowly outweighing her egomaniacal catalogue of what appears to  be every compliment that she was ever paid in her life, is the disingenuous treatment of the  implications of her view of democracy.  The essential fact is that Ms Guinier does not believe that the  United States Constitution, with it's system of representative democracy, adequately defends the rights  of minorities.  Therefore, she proposes adoption of schemes like cumulative voting, geared towards  allowing the losing minority to win actual representation regardless of their election loss.  For instance,  if a school board district voted 60% Republican and 40% Democrat, they would send three Republicans  and two Democrats to the board.  Now you could discuss the merits and drawbacks of these types of  Rube Goldberg mechanisms until you were blue in the face, but the primary point here is that they  represent a radical departure from our current constitutional regime and are a fundamental attack on  representative democracy.  There is no reason that we should not consider and debate these types of  measures, but intellectual honesty requires that their advocates describe them accurately.  Guinier's  refusal to do so casts a shadow of deception over the book.<br />In the final analysis, where Judge Bork's book stands out in particular for the intellectual rigor of his  arguments and analysis, Guinier's is merely interesting as a portrait of the shallowness and duplicity of  her friends the Clintons.<br />GRADE: D+cy.

I was curious how it came  into being. Because it does have a narrative skeleton, but over that is a fantastically imaginative,  rich overlay of words and images. What came to you first - an image? Or was the entire plot  present in your mind from the beginning?<br />  Michael Ondaatje : No, the plot wasn't there until I finished the book, probably. I don't really begin  a novel, or any kind of book, with any sure sense of what's happening or even what's going to  happen. Almasy [the badly-burned &quot;English patient&quot; whose tragic love affair with Katherine Clifton  forms the heart of the book] wasn't in the story in my head. Kip [the Indian sapper, or  bomb-disposal expert, whose love affair with the English patient's nurse, Hana, offers a  counterpoint to Almasy's story] wasn't in the story. Caravaggio [a shadowy thief with bandaged  hands] wasn't in the story. It began with this plane crash and it went on from there. Now, why did  this plane crash? What did that have to do with this guy in the plane? Who was the guy? When was  it happening? Where was it happening? All those things had to be uncovered or unearthed, as  opposed to being sure in my head.<br />  Then there was a nurse and there was a patient, there was a man who was stealing back a  photograph of himself. It was those three images. I did not know who they were, or how they were  connected. So I sat down, I started to write and try to discover what the story was. And build from  those three germs, really. I tend not to know what the plot is or the story is or even the theme.  Those things come later, for me.  -INTERVIEW : Delirious in a Different Kind of Way (Gary Kamiya, November, 1996, Salon)<br />Long time readers of these pages will be familiar with the concept of &quot;Letting the Tiger out of the  Cage&quot; (newcomers may want to read a brief definition.)  Well, what are we to make of a novel whose  genesis in the author's mind was the scene where the tiger gets let out?  Because as I was watching the  movie version, I desperately wanted the husband to succeed in crashing his plane and his wife into  Ralph Fiennes.  I mean, I know this is supposed to be a great tragic love triangle and all, but I'm not  big on adultery to begin with, added to which is the fact that they are just horrible people and what  passes for love amongst them is really little more than sado-masochism.  So, yes, I wanted them dead. Nor did I particularly care that the petty sneak thief, Caravaggio, had been dethumbed by the Nazis.<br />The characters that I did care for somewhat were Hana and Kip.  I realize that Hana was supposed to  be this horribly damaged woman, but c'mon, she's played by the luminescent Juliette Binoche, who, by  herself, nearly suffices to justify the continued existence of France.  Kip, meanwhile, is all earnestness  and courage, easy to like, even if his role onscreen is pretty minimal.  But then, just as it seems these  two and their relationship will rescue the story, Kip has his little freak out over the atom-bombing of  Japan, and we're left with only Hana.  After three hours, that just wasn't enough for me.<br />So I probably made a mistake when I tried reading this book right after seeing the movie; bringing too  much baggage along from the film to give the novel a fair shake.  Now, rereading it several years  later, I do like it better, but I still don't like it.<br />There's still the basic problem that the English Patient and Katherine Clifton are so profoundly  unlikeable and that their affair so little resembles what healthy humans think of as love.  Even more  disturbing, when the English Patient leads the Nazis across Northern Africa in exchange for access to  the cave where he left Katherine, he acts out the most abhorrent sentiment of the 20th Century, E. M.  Forster's monstrously selfish dictum : &quot;If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying  myfriend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.&quot;  It would even be more honorable if  the English Patient helped the Nazis out of a genuine feeling of Anti-Semitism.  It would at least  reflect a capacity to think of people beyond himself.  But the nature of his relationship with Katherine  is exactly this selfish and destructive, so perhaps aiding the German Army follows from the logic (or  illogic) of their affair.<br />Hana and Kip are more central to the story, and that helps greatly.  Kip's background is particularly  interesting.  The scenes of him being taught about bomb disposal and of his relationship with the Brits  who trained him are especially well done.  Unfortunately, they only serve to make it even more jarring  when he reacts so hysterically to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  His meltdown reads as if it's driven more  by Ondaatje's ideology than by the dictates of the character.<br />That ideology is troubling too.  In some ways, this is one of the most racist novels I've ever read :  Ondaatje is obsessed with skin and not merely it's substance but it's color. He mentions skin so many  times and in so many ways that I lost count, but, of course, the central metaphor of the story is the  English Patient, this vast repository of Western knowledge, with his white skin burned away.  Then  the old European lovers, he and Katherine, are supplanted by the new multiracial coupling of Kip and  Hana.  Finally, after Kip indicts the West for it's racially motivated bombing of Japan, he leaves the  Villa San Girolamo, this wreckage of Western civilization, and sets out on his own, symbolically  abandoning the white past and heading towards the brown future.  And just in case that's too subtle,  the final image of the book is Katherine knocking a fork off of a counter in Canada and Kip catching a  fork in India, the tools of civilization being transferred from white hands to brown.  There's a real air  of racial triumphalism and moral superiority to the story that perhaps only Third World authors can  get away with these days.<br />Ultimately, I did like the book somewhat better on rereading and it's much better than the movie.  There are some great images and the language is lyrical and often captivating, though after three  hundred pages it does get kind of cloying.  I guess this is one that I have some significant problems  with, but find interesting enough to give an extremely cautious recommendation.<br />GRADE : CI had to choose between betraying my country and betraying  my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.&quot;  It would even be more honorable if  the English Patient helped the Nazis out of a genuine feeling of Anti-Semitism.

And just in case that's too subtle,  the final image of the book is Katherine knocking a fork off of a counter in Canada and Kip catching a  fork in India, the tools of civilization being transferred from white hands to brown.  There's a real air  of racial triumphalism and moral superiority to the story that perhaps only Third World authors can  get away with these days.<br />Ultimately, I did like the book somewhat better on rereading and it's much better than the movie.   There are some great images and the language is lyrical and often captivating, though after three  hundred pages it does get kind of cloying.  I guess this is one that I have some significant problems  with, but find interesting enough to give an extremely cautious recommendation.<br />GRADE : C	2000-11-27

Ms  Hope it turns out is a romance novelist, writing under a pseudonym.  She spends her days at the Hotel  working on her new novel, going for walks and taking tea with her colorful fellow guests and looking  back at the chain of events which brought her to this place in her life.<br />What develops is an extended meditation on the need for love and marriage and companionship.  Ms  Hope is all too passive in the face of these great issues.  As she tells her agent:<br />  ''People love (the story of the tortoise and the hare), especially women.  Now you will notice, Harold, that in my books it is the mouse-like  unassuming girl who gets the hero, while the scornful temptress with  whom he has had a stormy affair retreats baffled from the fray, never to  return. The tortoise wins every time. This is a lie, of course. . . . In real life,  of course, it is the hare who wins. Every time. Look around you. And in any  case it is my contention that Aesop was writing for the tortoise market.  Axiomatically. . . . Hares have no time to read. They are too busy winning the game.  The propaganda goes all the other way, but only because it is the tortoise  who is in need of consolation. Like the meek who are going to inherit the  earth.''<br />In the end, even if she doesn't necessarily get her man, she proves to be the tortoise emerging  &quot;victorious&quot; once again.<br />This is a wry, witty novel, sort of a humorous update of an E.M. Forster tale.  But it's an extremely  slender story and the docility of it's central character is quite annoying.  In the concluding scenes she is  rescued by a sort of Deus Ex Machina twist rather than by any personal growth or enlightenment.

Tim Russert  asked him if, in light of new access to Soviet files &amp; the revelation of the Venona Intercepts, he would  be prepared to acknowledge that Alger Hiss was a spy.  Lake sat there like a deer in the headlights &amp;  then mumbled some bilge about how it was still an open question.  And there you had it; for 50 years  now, this seemingly simple question has lain at the fault line of the Left/Right divide in American  politics. You could tell where someone stood on the political spectrum simply by getting their answer  to whether Chambers or Hiss had told the truth.  (If you think this overstates the case, compare Victor  Navasky's obituary editorial from The Nation with Brent Bozell's analysis of the Hiss obituaries). For  the American Left (never mind the European Left), the innocence of Alger Hiss was an article of  faith.  After all, if such a mainstream New Deal figure as Hiss had actually been part of a secret  underground cabal, spying on the US for the Soviets, even as WWII was underway, then a whole  battery of conservative attacks would gain legitimacy and the whole of FDR's legacy (both New Deal  and Grand Alliance) would be called into question.  Well, it's time for our entire society to face those  questions and this celebrated Chambers biography by Sam Tanenhaus offers an excellent starting point.<br />The story of Whittaker Chambers is familiar enough, yet remains fundamentally elusive.  Born on  April 1, 1901, his life journey is a virtual parable of Modern man.  His father was bisexual, his mother  paranoid, grandmother (who lived with them) completely insane, younger brother committed suicide.  Chambers was brilliant but slovenly, both physically and mentally.  His own sexuality was somewhat  ambiguous and he was generally alienated from the world around him.  After failing to complete his  degree at Columbia, he joined the Communist party and went underground in it's extensive espionage  apparatus, wherein, he helped to run a Washington, DC spy ring.  By 1937, with Stalinist purges and  show trials in full swing and amidst the brutal Stalinization of the republicans in the Spanish Civil War,  Chambers became disenchanted with the Party &amp; fled the underground.  he attempted to reveal what he  knew about communist spying to the requisite government authorities, but was basically ignored.  Chambers ended up as an editor at Henry Luce's Time magazine &amp; built a reputable middle class life  for himself, his wife &amp; their son &amp; daughter.  He become devoutly religious and vehemently  anti-Communist.<br />Then he was sucked back into the maelstrom when he was called to testify before the House  Un-American Activities Committee.  He revealed that Alger Hiss, a prominent New Dealer and pillar  of the Establishment, had been a member of his 30's spy ring.  Hiss promptly denied it and the stage  was set for a years long legal battle that finally ended with Hiss being convicted for perjury.<br />In 1952, he published his brilliant memoir, Witness, in which he recounted his own life experiences  and sounded the alarm to alert the West that it was locked in a death struggle between Communism and  Christianity.  One of the things that made the book so extraordinary was his assertion that in leaving  Communism &amp; becoming a Christian, he had joined the losing side in this struggle.<br />He spent the last few years of his life working on his beloved farm &amp; writing articles &amp; reviews,  including a series of letters to the newly born National Review.  He died in 1961.<br />Seems straightforward enough, eh?  But he was &amp; remains one of the most controversial figures,  along with Hiss, of the 20th century.  Oceans of ink have been spilled, trying to explain how he could  have been mistaken about Hiss or how he was a scorned lover of Hiss or how he was used to discredit  Hiss &amp; through Hiss impeach the whole New Deal, and so on &amp; so on....<br />Despite the real greatness of this book, Tanenhaus can't clear up many of the mysteries of the story for  us, but he does provide several valuable services.  First, by presenting the Hiss material in a simple  declarative manner, he lays to rest any lingering doubts about whether Hiss was guilty of spying for the  Soviet Union and then committing perjury about it later.  It will be impossible for anyone to contest  the mountain of evidence that he lays out so masterfully.  Second, he reclaims Chambers the writer.  Witness is widely recognized as one of the great books of the Century, but Tanenhaus also demonstrates  that his work for Time and National Review and even the stories that he wrote as a young man are the  product of a gifted writer.  Third, he shows that there were Reds to be uncovered during the Red Scares  and when diligent men like Richard Nixon went after them, they hit pay dirt.  But he also shows that  Joe McCarthy, who alienated Chambers with his dilettantish behavior &amp; was never really serious about  the investigatory process, effectively discredited the whole anti-Communist movement.  Finally, as the  Cold War fades in our rearview mirror, Tanenhaus recaptures the mood &amp; feeling of the time when it  seemed likely to be our Gotterdammerung.  Hopefully, folks who read this book will also seek out  Witness and find, in it's dark and frightening world view, the lost emotional fervor that fueled the  anti-Communists &amp; brought us Barry Goldwater &amp; Ronald Reagan and eventual victory over the  USSR.<br />GRADE: Ar how he was a scorned lover of Hiss or how he was used to discredit  Hiss &amp; through Hiss impeach the whole New Deal, and so on &amp; so on....<br />Despite the real greatness of this book, Tanenhaus can't clear up many of the mysteries of the story for  us, but he does provide several valuable services.

But it's pretty slender and just barely worthy of a book length  treatment.  It seems like it would work better as a long magazine article or even as a novel and it will  make a terrific movie.<br />In the latter portion of the 19th century, when James A. H. Murray faced the monumental task of  compiling the initial version of the Oxford English Dictionary, he sent out a call for contributors.  One  of the most reliable and thorough volunteers proved to be Dr. William Chester Minor.  But Minor  resisted entreaties to visit the operations of the OED and to partake in the celebrations as volumes were  completed.  The reason for his reticence turned out to be his incarceration in Broadmoor Criminal  Lunatic Asylum.<br />Minor, an American, was profoundly disturbed and a murderer to boot.  After some disquieting years  of service in a medical unit during the Civil War, he fixed upon an obsession that Irishmen wanted to  kill him.  His psychoses finally led him to gun down a complete stranger on a British street and he was  institutionalized.  He eventually spent about 50 of his over 80 years in some form of state care, where  he was continually plagued by delusions that he was being spied upon and his food poisoned, and at one  point he mutilated himself in a fashion which will have male readers cringing in horror.  Meanwhile,  his incarceration and his educational attainment made him uniquely well suited to contribute to the  mammoth undertaking that was the OED.<br />Winchester does a creditable job of showing how two very different men were united by their love of  language and learning.  But, there are pretty obvious dramatic limitations to a true life story that  involves one subject who's institutionalized and another who's writing a dictionary.  Like I said, it's a  pretty slim tale, but it is fascinating.<br />GRADE: B+	2000-11-27

I believe that this war, upon which  I  entered as a war of defence and liberation, has now become a war of aggression and conquest. I  believe that the purposes for which I and my fellow-soldiers entered upon this war should have been  so clearly stated as to have made it impossible to change them, and that, had this been done, the  objects which actuated us would now be attainable by negotiation.<br />  I have seen and endured the sufferings of the troops, and I can no longer be a party to prolong these  sufferings for ends which I believe to be evil and unjust.<br />  I am not protesting against the conduct of the war, but against the political errors and insincerities  for which the fighting men are being sacrificed.<br />  On behalf of those who are suffering now I make this protest against the deception which is being  practiced on them; also I believe that I may help to destroy the callous complacence with which the  majority of those at home regard the continuance of agonies which they do not share, and which  they have not sufficient imagination to realize.<br />  -Siegfried L. Sassoon, July 1917<br />I read and mildly liked Regeneration, the first volume of Pat Barker's WWI trilogy.  It dealt with the  true story Dr. William River's successful effort to heal the &quot;mentally unsound&quot; poet/hero/war protester  Siegfried Sassoon and get him back to the Front.  With cameos by fellow poets Robert Graves and  Wilfred Owen, there was a subtle homosexual subtext, but the heart of the story was the relative sanity  or insanity of participating in war.  I could not read the second volume, The Eye in the Door, which  concerns a secretly gay soldier's work with the domestic intelligence services, trying to expose gay  officials who would be security risks.  And I tried to read this final volume, but will admit to skipping  to the end after one too many ankle grabbing episode.  Near the end of the book I finally figured out  what the point of the entire exercise is.  There is one scene where a drunken soldier confides to  Wilfred Owen that the horrible thing about the War is that it is depriving them of  &quot;Beethoven,  Botticelli, beer and boys.&quot;  There it is in a nutshell.  Pat Barker's series conveys the strange sense that  World War I was senseless because it upset a number of gay British poets and killed a fair number of  their potential lovers.<br />To the extent that it has a broader premise, it is merely that war is bad and World War I was really  bad.  She accepts all the stock premises about how incompetent the commanding generals were and  how government officials cynically prolonged an unwinnable war for their own domestic political  purposes.  And of course the noble soldiers, who had never wanted any part of this War, simply  suffered for their nation's sins.  And if that was true of the coarse and uncultured commoners, imagine  how much worse the sensitive poets must have suffered.  All of this has been the accepted wisdom  about the War, the official Left version of events, so it is little surprise that these books have received  such accolades.  But the last year has seen the publishing of the two best nonfiction books ever written  about WWI, The Pity of War by Niall Ferguson and The First World War by John Keegan (read  Orrin's review) and they explode these myths.  Upon further review, it turns out that the War was an  unnecessary but popular endeavor, well lead though obviously ugly and the &quot;winning&quot; of it proved  more disastrous than the fighting and carnage involved.<br />One of the folks reviewing this book said that:<br />  It was not until 1914 that words became inadequate to describe the horrors of war.<br />This appears to accurately reflect Barker's view, but it is completely asinine.  First, the idea that words  can adequately describe war, second, the idea that the WWI generation was exceptional, that the  presence of a bunch of minor poets on the front lines means that a great literature or a unique  understanding came out of the war.  In truth, no soldier of WWI produced a work of literature that can  approach the Civil War Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, a man whom these effete poets would have  dismissed as brutal and dull.  WWI was a war like any other: those fighting it hated it, the combatants  included everyone from gifted authors to cretinous scum, those who won the War mythologized it and  the losers were left with a festering sore in their souls, which would eventually trigger the next World  War.<br />So the book is based on a series of unexamined misconceptions, which is bad enough.  But by the time  you get to to the scene of a British soldier buggering the living daylights out of a French farm boy,  you'll be ready to burn it.  Actually, you may be lucky enough never to get that far, because I'm  warning you now: This book is an abomination.<br />GRADE: Fas not until 1914 that words became inadequate to describe the horrors of war.<br />This appears to accurately reflect Barker's view, but it is completely asinine.

If the ironic viewpoint ever did offer a useful perspective on Man's existence, and it  likely did, we have long since passed that point and have slid into a period when irony has nearly  degraded us all into cultural nihilists.  A little skepticism goes a long way, but push it too far and it will  eventually consume everything in it's path.<br />Particularly dangerous is that strain of literature which, by discarding narrative structure, continually  shifting points of reference, and toying with the meanings of words and phrases, ultimately tends to  suggest that coherent communication may be impossible.  There is a peculiar kind of arrogance at work  in such manipulation of language, which is intended to obscure, rather than to reveal.  It is so  individualistic and relativistic as to only be truly accessible to the author himself, or to those who are  willing to make the study of that author and his writings their own life's work.  If language can't  communicate, why is the author writing words down and why should we read them ?<br />Oddly enough, one of the best descriptions I've ever found of this tendency was in a police procedural :  The Death of a Joyce Scholar: A Peter McGarr Mystery (1989)(Bartholomew Gill 1943-) (Grade:  B+); it reads in part :<br />  And since the form of the novel as written from Richardson to Joyce was exhausted, Samuel  Beckett turned around and attempted to exhaust the form in its 'negative' image, as it were--the  novel of incompetence.  By incompetence Beckett does not mean novels written by incompetent  authors.  He means that, unlike Joyce, he cannot assume the possibility of communication among  human beings, much less between human beings and the collective unconscious.<br />  For Beckett words don't work.  They are an imposition, given us by others after our births; they  really can't describe our own particular experiences in our own individual terms.  Also, when we  speak words, we need somebody else to hear and acknowledge them.  A witness.  In other words,  we can't say us in our own terms for anybody's ears but our own.  And if we were to try, say, by  speaking out all the words of the Others once and for all, we would find that there's nothing to say,  since Western civilization assumes that we are no more than what we were when we were born--a  tabula rasa, a void, un neant, a nothing.  And nothing can only be described by silence.<br />Such is the inevitable end result of this philosophy, man rendered silent.<br />There is a famous incident wherein Boswell says to Samuel Johnson that they can not refute Bishop  Berkeley's theory that we can not prove that matter exists but can only know that we perceive it.  Johnson thereupon kicked a rock and said : &quot;I refute it thus.&quot;  This does not necessarily disprove  Berkeley's argument in purely logical terms, but amply demonstrates the uselessness of the theory.  Similarly, one is tempted to respond to Beckett by telling him to yell &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater.  There simply is some fundamental level at which absurdism is itself so patently ridiculous as not to be  worth talking seriously.  Kind of ironic, huh ?<br />All of which brings us to Trout Fishing in America, the best known, and seemingly the best, work of  the Beat novelist and poet Richard Brautigan.  As a cover blurb on my decrepit Delta Books addition  says :<br />  Mr. Brautigan submitted a book to us in 1962 called TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA.  I gather  from the reports that it was not about trout fishing.  -an editor at The Viking Press<br />The book isn't really about anything, in the conventional sense.  It's chapters are loosely unified by a  repeated reference to fishing for trout in America (mostly Brautigan's native Pacific Northwest) and to  a character named Trout Fishing in America, and a hotel named Trout Fishing in America, and a book  titled Trout Fishing in America, and so on...  Metaphors twist back on themselves; meanings multiply;  even the cover photo of the book (see above) and the statue in the picture become integral to the text.  It is playful, often amusing, frequently frustratingly obscure, and it's hard to see what it all adds up to.<br />Thankfully, Brautigan has the good sense to keep it brief and not to strain for greater meaning than his  verbal tricks will support. And in a final odd twist, he tells the reader in the penultimate chapter that  he's always wanted to &quot;write a book that ended with the word Mayonnaise.&quot;  However, in the final  chapter, he actually ends with the word &quot;mayonaise.&quot;<br />GRADE : Ctrout in America (mostly Brautigan's native Pacific Northwest) and to  a character named Trout Fishing in America, and a hotel named Trout Fishing in America, and a book  titled Trout Fishing in America, and so on...

In the following  weeks, the Japanese raped and/or murdered hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians  (perhaps as many as 350,000 were killed) in one of the most brutal episodes in the long bloody history  of warfare.  But, if you're like me, &quot;the rape of Nanking&quot; is little more than a vaguely remembered  term from a history book.  Iris Chang's book remedies that situation, giving the facts the full airing that  they deserve, and explains why the massacre is so poorly remembered--largely because of political  considerations she argues. The result is a really moving act of remembrance that offers a mixed bag of  lessons.<br />In the first instance, like all such books, Chang goes a little bit overboard, but understandably so, in  trying to claim pride of place for the Rape of Nanking in the catalogue of genocidal rampages.  Arguments of this kind reach a point where they have a too self-centered and masochistic tinge to  them.  It suffices, that the acts perpetrated upon the Chinese population by the Japanese Army are  horrific.  No hyperbole is needed.  Nor is it necessary to, as Ms Chang does, portray the world's  relative failure to commemorate these events and the Japanese government's failure to compensate  victims as a second rape.  I would think that firebombing the living bejeezus out of Tokyo and  dropping two atomic bombs would have amply demonstrated our displeasure with the Japanese.  Even  if it was vicarious, the victims surely got their pound of flesh.<br />Her argument that political considerations in America, Japan and China have created a kind of  conspiracy of silence is more compelling.  The Red Chinese government which took over the country  after the war, chose not to make an issue of the rape for their own reasons--the shame that this  xenophobic regime must have felt appears to have ensured their silence.  The Japanese have obvious  reasons for not wanting to dwell on the massacre, but she is absolutely right that they have a moral  obligation to acknowledge that they perpetrated, to teach their youngsters about these darkest aspects of  the war and perhaps even to make some restitution to survivors.  The aggressive campaign by certain  elements in Japanese society to deny that the rape ever took place or was as bad as purported is  troubling, but is part of a much larger societal ill in Japanese culture, a failure to reckon with endemic  racism and a to come to grips with a pretty ugly past.  Sadly, willful blindness to the facts of Nanking  is only a symptom of a larger disease.<br />America, for it's part, wanted to rehabilitate postwar Japan so that we'd have a good ally in the quickly  descending Cold War.  It ill served our purposes to rub their noses in their obviously abhorrent record  of war crimes.  But it should be remembered that we pretty much let them off the hook for things like  the Bataan Death March too.  There is no discernible racial component here, simply icy cold  realpolitik.  But Chang is absolutely right on this point, that none of the three nations has been willing  to make the atrocities a public issue.<br />One really edifying lesson that emerges is the danger of judging people too easily.  Chang reconstructs  the truly remarkable and heroic efforts of the European/American community in Nanking to try and  protect refugees from the Japanese.  Amazingly enough it turns out that one of the prime movers in this  effort, the &quot;Oskar Schindler of Nanking&quot; (see Orrin's review of Schindler's List), was a Nazi official  named John Rabe.  The passages describing his actions on behalf of the Chinese, even to the point of  demanding a meeting with the Fuhrer, make for one of the most fascinating sections of the book.<br />Finally, the most important lessons are offered in what I thought was an excellent and insightful  conclusion to the book:  that the Japanese were not &quot;uniquely sinister&quot;, that there is a relatively thin  veneer of civilization that stands between any culture and the capacity for such horrible actions; and  that it is all too easy to accept such genocidal actions even as they are occurring.  These lessons are  being driven home today in places like Bosnia, Chechnya and Rwanda and warning flags are going up  in the nations of Europe where fascist anti-immigrant parties are gaining ground from Austria to  France and beyond.  But the big lesson that Chang cites--the most important lesson of the last  century--is the danger that we all face whenever governments centralize power to themselves.  The 20th  Century was characterized by two directly related phenomena, the increasing centralization of political  power in the hands of national governments and the bureaucrats who run them and the vicious, often  homicidal, application of that power to those nations' own citizens.  From the internment of Japanese  Americans by FDR to the Nazi Death Camps to the Russian gulag to the Rape of Nanking to the Killing  Fields of Cambodia to the current instances in Africa and the Balkans, this is a lesson that has been  demonstrated time and again but which we seem inordinately reluctant to accept.  Governments are  simply too untrustworthy too allow them to aggrandize the amount of power that has become routine in  modern times.  It is reflexive to defend the American system as somehow special and beyond these kind  of considerations, but I for one am awfully grateful that this theory was not put to the test in WWII.  You may feel confident that we would never have exacted some warped retribution on the citizens we  sent to concentration camps, but I tremble to think what their fate might have been had the war in the  Pacific gone poorly for us, or had it been San Francisco that was firebombed instead of Tokyo.<br />Chang's excellent book implicates all of these issues and should engender much soul searching.  Her  excesses of tone are perfectly understandable in light of her topic and her sense of mission, to bring  these largely forgotten facts before a disinterested public.<br />GRADE: Aght was an excellent and insightful  conclusion to the book:  that the Japanese were not &quot;uniquely sinister&quot;, that there is a relatively thin  veneer of civilization that stands between any culture and the capacity for such horrible actions; and  that it is all too easy to accept such genocidal actions even as they are occurring.

It is reflexive to defend the American system as somehow special and beyond these kind  of considerations, but I for one am awfully grateful that this theory was not put to the test in WWII.   You may feel confident that we would never have exacted some warped retribution on the citizens we  sent to concentration camps, but I tremble to think what their fate might have been had the war in the  Pacific gone poorly for us, or had it been San Francisco that was firebombed instead of Tokyo.<br />Chang's excellentbook implicates all of these issues and should engender much soul searching.   Her  excesses of tone are perfectly understandable in light of her topic and her sense of mission, to bring  these largely forgotten facts before a disinterested public.<br />GRADE: A	2000-11-27

Books	5	4	7	N	N	thought provoking and it's great fun besides	I can't imagine that there's anyone reading this who doesn't know the plot of Planet of the Apes.  If you've never read the book, suffice it to say that the movie (Planet of the Apes--1968) was a relatively faithful adaptation of the text.  Most of the changes that were made relate to the framing devices used to begin and end the respective stories and some understandable deFrenchifying of the astronauts.<br />Here again, as in Bridge on the River Kwai (see Orrin's review), Boulle brilliantly succeeds in presenting an idea-rich novel in a minimum number of pages (I read an old movie tie-in copy that was just 128 pages long).  This brevity does a few things: it provides the novel with a headlong narrative drive; it speeds the reader past the holes in the plot and premise; and it makes for a book whose full implications only really become apparent on further reflection.  I think many of the ideas conveyed by the novel are false.  There is no bigger lie in the history of symbols than the schoolroom wall charts of our youth showing the tree of life with man and apes dangling at the end of one branch or the march of species leading from australopithecus, or whoever, on up to homo sapiens, and the book relies heavily on this shaky premise that evolution is just that smooth and linear and that our interconnectedness with the lesser primates is exactly that close.  This is all extraordinarily dubious; but it is assuredly thought provoking and it's great fun besides.<br />GRADE: A<br />FILM: A+	2000-11-25

The case is that, just as each of us has always secretly suspected, modern art is crap.  In fact, not only is it crap, it is intentionally so, more or less as a calculated insult to our middle brow tastes.  Indeed, while most of us would consider it the purpose of art to convey beauty, modern artists consider art to be merely a tool for political expression.  Logically then, since most of them are, and were, opposed to our middle class, democratic, capitalist, protestant values, modern art is antithetical to virtually everything that most of us believe in.<br />I say that we have all always intuited that this is true, but it was left to Tom Wolfe, naturally, to declare for one and all that the emperor had no clothes.  He does this most forcefully in the opening lines of Bauhaus, which deals with modern architecture, when he says:<br />  O beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, has there ever been another place on earth  where so many people of wealth and power have paid for and put up with so much architecture they  detested as within they blessed borders today?<br />But the reasons for the sorry state of the arts are most clearly explicated in Painted Word.  The essay therein was occasioned by a Hilton Kramer review of an exhibition of Realist artists.  On the morning of April 28, 1974, Wolfe picked up the New York Times and read the following by Kramer:<br />  &quot;Realism does not lack its partisans, but it does rather conspicuously lack a persuasive theory.  And  given the nature of our intellectual commerce with works of art, to lack a persuasive theory is to  lack something crucial--the means by which our experience of individual works is joined to our  understanding of the values they signify.&quot;<br />Kramer's words brought about an epiphany:<br />  All these years, in short, I had assumed that in art, if nowhere else, seeing is believing. Well - how  very shortsighted! Now, at last, on April 28, 1974, I could see. I had gotten it backward all along.  Not `seeing is believing', you ninny, but `believing is seeing', for Modern Art has become completely  literary: the paintings and other works exist only to illustrate the text.<br />Painted Word is an extended riff upon this theme--the idea that art had become wholly dependent on theory.  His case builds to the stunning d&eacute;nouement when an artist named Lawrence Weiner presented the following artwork in the April 1970 issue of Arts Magazine:<br />  1. The artist may construct the piece  2. The piece may be fabricated  3. The piece need not be built  Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with  the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.<br />Concludes Wolfe:<br />  And there, at last, it was!  No more realism, no more representational objects, no more lines, colors  forms, and contours, no more pigments, no more brushstrokes, no more evocations, no more  frames, walls, galleries, museums, no more gnawing at the tortured face of the god Flatness, no  more audience required, just a &quot;receiver&quot; that may or may not be there at all, no more ego projected,  just &quot;the artist&quot;, in the third person, who may be anyone or no one at all, not even existence, for that  got lost in the subjunctive mode--and in the moment of absolutely dispassionate abdication, of  insouciant withering away, Art made its final flight, climbed higher and higher until, with one last erg  of freedom, one last dendritic synapse, it disappeared up its own fundamental aperature...and came  out the other side as Art Theory!...Art Theory pure and simple, words on a page, literature undefiled  by vision, flat, flatter, Flattest, a vision invisible, even ineffable,as ineffable as the Angels and the  Universal Souls.<br />And it is upon reaching this final state of pure theory that C.S. Lewis pessimistic prediction in The Abolition of Man comes to fruition.  When we as a people, no longer capable of forming coherent judgments about quality, no longer confident enough to differentiate what is good from what is bad, end up being forced to accept any old garbage that is hailed by the critics and forced upon us.<br />Wolfe is at his wickedly funny, subversive best here, pricking the pretensions of the Art world--artists, critics and patrons alike.  If you want to know why the establishment reacts so angrily to his novels, you need look no farther than these two dissections of the tastes, or lack of such, exhibited by the intelligentsia in Modern Art.  When you pronounce to the world that the opinion makers live in ugly, uncomfortable buildings ands decorate their homes with art which is at best a hoax, at worst a pile of trash, you sort of have to expect that the opinions they deliver won't be all that favorable to you.<br />GRADE: A+ (taken together), literature undefiled      by vision, flat, flatter, Flattest, a vision invisible, even ineffable, as ineffable as the Angels and the      Universal Souls. <br />And it is upon reaching this final state of pure theory that C.S.

Even those who should know better accept this general proposition, witness George W. Bush's savvy but offensive campaign slogan &quot;Compassionate Conservative&quot; or Winston Churchill's famous dictum: Any man who is not a liberal when young has no heart, any man who is not a conservative when older has no brain.  This notion is particularly galling if you rooted for the Chicago police at the 1968 Convention and for the Guardsmen at Kent State, while aged 6 &amp; 10 respectively.  It is really frustrating that this misconception prevails regardless of the evidence of human experience.  Thus, the American Communists and fellow-travelers of the '30s &amp; '40s are considered to be misguided do-gooders, but those who opposed them on the Right are considered fascists.  Like something out of Alice in Wonderland, it is better in social circles to be Alger Hiss than Whittaker Chambers.<br />But there's no use complaining about any of this, first because no one cares, second because it is so deeply ingrained in the political psyche.  It is something that we simply learn to accept, sort of the way you learn to accept that Blacks will continue to vote Democrat despite the fact that Democrat policies have lead directly to the ghettoization or imprisonment of a significant portion of the black populace.  It does however lead to some uncomfortable moments, especially when you are young.  So most conservatives have some Ur-text that has a particular meaning to them--that first book (or magazine--for many it was National Review) that whispered: &quot;You are not alone.  You are not abnormal.&quot;  Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (read Orrin's review), Witness, Buckley's God and Man at Yale, Conscience of a Conservative (read Orrin's review), all of these books fit the bill for many, but for me, the first great text was Radical Chic by Tom Wolfe.<br />Radical Chic, which famously chronicles a party hosted by Leonard Bernstein and his wife to raise money for the Black Panthers, did something unique, something which I don't believe had been done up until that time.  It's not a polemic; it doesn't come right out and say anything directly negative about the Panthers or their white upper class supporters.  It does something much more insidious; it makes them appear ridiculous.  What a sublime moment that was, to have someone out there saying, not simply that the other side was wrong, but that they were silly.  Somehow it made it alright that folks considered us troglodytes, after all, if our views seemed harsh and uncaring at least we didn't look imbecilic.  Since then of course the floodgates have opened--much of Ronald Reagan's appeal lay in his ability to make conservatives feel proud of their beliefs and to poke gentle fun at the most ridiculous aspects of liberal dogma and authors like PJ O'Rourke and Chris Buckley do a brilliant job of exposing the profound idiocy at the heart of liberalism.  The old dictum that to a liberal life is a tragedy, to a conservative a comedy, is amply borne out in the writing of these genuinely funny observers.<br />Had Tom Wolfe never written another word we would still be beholden to him for blazing this trail.  Lucky for us, this was simply the first great salvo in a long career of puncturing the pretensions of the Establishment Left, as evidenced by the second story in the book, Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers.  Here he chronicles the exploitation of white guilt by minority activist applying for government grant money in San Francisco.  He would go on to write several terrific conservative novels--Bonfire of the Vanities and A Man in Full (read Orrin's review)--and one great audio novella--Ambush at Fort Bragg (read Orrin's review)--but he may never have written anything better than Radical Chic.<br />GRADE: A+Ambush at Fort Bragg (read Orrin's review)--but he may never have written anything better than Radical Chic. <br />GRADE: A+	2000-11-25

Because as we reach its end, the greatest poet of the 20th Century seems destined to be remembered as the guy who wrote Cats.  His banishment from the canon was probably inevitable, what with being a white male Christian and the whiff of anti-Semitism wafting from him, but if he ever had a chance to cling to his spot on the basis of his early classics like The Wasteland and Prufrock, works like The Hollow Men pretty much guaranteed he would be consigned to oblivion.  For this poem, while not as coherent an attack on Modern values or lack of said, as the writings of someone like C.S. Lewis, is certainly one of the most eloquent.<br />  THE HOLLOW MEN (1927)<br />  Mistah Kurtz-he dead.

Like Clavell, the great strength of Herbert's novel is the way that he intertwines plots and schemes:  everyone has their own agenda; alliances are temporary and purely expedient; loyalties are shifting; even kinship is no bar to treachery.<br />The central story concerns Paul Atreides, the 15 year old son of Duke Leto and his Bene Gesserit concubine the Lady Jessica.  Paul is the product of a millennia old Bene Gesserit breeding program and may be the Kwisatz Haderach, a hyper-evolved mental adept with extraordinary extrasensory powers.  Even as Lady Jessica is training Paul in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, the Duke is training him to lead the embattled House Atreides.  Emperor Shaddam IV has just turned over control of the desert planet Arrakis with its invaluable spice concession to the Atreides, but the Emperor recognizes that Duke Leto is a powerful rival and and the Imperium's invincible troopers, the Sardaukar, make the Emperor particularly dangerous.  Likewise, the Atreides rising fortunes have caused jealousy and hatred among other families of the Landsraad, a sort of combine of the great trading houses.  In particular, the vile Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose House Harkonnen has just lost control of Arrakis, also known as Dune, is bent on the destruction of the Atreides.  As plots and counterplots explode, sometimes quite literally, Paul and the Lady Jessica are turned out into the desert of Dune where no humans can long survive exposure to the elements, but they are taken in by the mysterious Fremen, a fierce desert people who believe that Paul may be their Messiah.  At this point, Herbert brings religious themes into the mix and the story really gets interesting.<br />This book won both the Hugo and Nebula awards and is widely considered to be one of, if not the, best science fiction novels ever written.  It is a grand space opera combining elements of Byzantine politics and an Islam-like religious movement.  Ironically, the weakest strand of the story is also the most speculative.  Melange, the spice of Dune, is so valuable because it is basically a mind-altering drug, which is used by the Spacing Guild to warp space and time and facilitate intergalactic travel.  While the political and religious strands of the story have a familiar logic to them, whenever the story turns to Melange and its effects, the tale gets pretty sketchy.  Unfortunately, in the sequels to the book this drug-induced storyline gained increasing prominence at the expense of coherence.  But for this one novel, Frank Herbert masterfully wields his complex plot across a sweeping canvas and soaks the maximum tension out of a large scale political and religious conflict.

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	sublime	I believe the Lord of the Rings to be the greatest fiction of the 20th Century and perhaps the greatest of all time.  The failure to include it on the Modern Library Top 100 is completely inexplicable.  Happily, the Amazon Top 100, which was voted on by actual readers, put it at number one.  Allow me to offer the reasons, both objective and personal, why I think that is it's rightful place on any list.<br />When we speak of authors as gods, or more likely they speak of themselves as such, there is of course an element of hyperbole, but it accompanies a kernel of truth.  Within the boundaries of their fiction, authors are in fact Creators and wield godlike powers.  They define reality, control events, decide who lives and who dies.  The best of them create characters and situations that the reader genuinely cares about and a very few of them, the best of the best, create characters and situations which seem to exist beyond the bounds of the story.  To take an easy example, there is Sherlock Holmes.  Not only do many people simply assume that he actually existed, not only did readers demand that he be brought back from the dead, there is a continual flow of further adventures and prequels being written all the time.  Holmes is so &quot;real&quot; to us that an author can write about his childhood or his old age and easily carry us along because in our guts we feel that he enjoyed such phases of life.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created a character whom we feel must have had a past and a future independent of the tales the author left us.  This is truly a remarkable accomplishment.<br />On the other hand, consider Leopold Bloom from James Joyce's Ulysses (see Orrin's review).  Because the entire novel is technique and artifice it is impossible to imagine a Bloom who exists outside of the author's head.  He has no past or future because Joyce didn't write them.  This in itself does not make Ulysses a bad book--there are plenty of other reasons that it is a bad book.  It is certainly possible to create a great book or a great protagonist within these bounds.  Holden Caufield, for instance, is a great character and Catcher in the Rye a great book (see Orrin's review), but he is unimaginable as an adult.  Though memorable and sympathetic, his existence is intrinsically enmeshed within this particular novel.<br />All of which is by way of introduction to what is perhaps the greatest feat of creative imagination in all of literature, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  Tolkien created not merely one or two characters who seem to have an external existence, he created an entire world, several races, entire languages, mythologies, songs, poetry, and so on, until finally it comes to seem that he is merely the historian of a separate world, rather than it's Creator.  The thoroughness with which he realizes his unique vision gives to his fiction a texture and a substance which may never be equaled.  He was able to achieve this remarkable effect in large part by spending years working on the background elements of his story before ever turning his attention to the main narrative thread.  For example, dwarves are a common enough staple of fantasy and fairy tales, but because Tolkien had spent years developing a dwarvish language and writing a history of the dwarves and imagining a dwarvish mythology, when we come upon a dwarf in Middle Earth, he seems not to be a convenient imaginary figure but an actual being with his own life story, racial history and tongue.  This is likewise true for the elves, the hobbits, even the orcs--a pretty amazing achievement.<br />All of this would suffice to rank these books among the world's greatest, even if he just put the characters through some fairly pedestrian paces, just some standard quest or adventure.  But Tolkien's has a much higher ambition here.  His religious influences and aims are well understood and I'll not dwell on them here.  I'm more interested in the way the stories function as democratic myth.  Thegreat tension in the series is not truly between good and evil, rather it derives from the capacity of power to corrupt good people.  Elves and men and dwarves and even Gandalf must all struggle, some successfully, some not, against the temptation to take the ring of power themselves.  Each is able to imagine that committing acts of short term evil will allow them to act for what they perceive as the greater good.  But in fact it is only the lowly hobbits, Sam and Frodo, with no aspirations towards greatness, who can wield power selflessly and even they ultimately require divine intervention to finally destroy the ring.  This political understanding further elevates the series and provides it with a message that resonates with our experience, particularly in the 20th Century.  The various races who are tempted by the ring resemble New Dealers and Bolsheviks and Maoists, each of them thinking that they are uniquely capable of using power toward good ends, failing to perceive that the seductive qualities of power itself is warping their souls.  In the end, in Middle Earth as on Earth, only the humble folk should be trusted with power and even they bear watching.<br />Finally, to my subjective reasons.  If my Mom is to be believed, and I think we can trust her on this one, it was around 5th grade that I really became a reader.  As I recall, my teacher Mrs. Deakens got me going on books about explorers.  Like any young boy I was captivated by such tales of adventure.  I devoured comic books swashbucklers and science fiction.  I read every Doc Savage I could get my hands on, Tarzan (see Orrin's review), John Carter of Mars, Conan, and any other pulp fiction I could find.  Meanwhile, our neighbor, Mark Farris, read the same books over and over again in an unending cycle--the Chronicles of Narnia (see Orrin's review) straight through, then the Lord of the Rings from start to finish and back to Narnia--and he swore by them.  Now the Narnia books weren't too daunting. each one is pretty slender, so I managed them.  But the Lord of the Rings offers quite an imposing structure to the kid who contemplates reading it.  Taken together the four books are what? maybe 1700 or so pages?  Well, of course I did eventually screw up my courage and tackle this daunting task and not only was I ensorceled by the story, but having finished I was naturally inordinately proud of myself.  Add that sense of self satisfaction into the mix and I'd imagine that for most kids who read the series at a certain age it inevitably becomes their favorite.  In fact, I'd like to get these kids who are so enraptured by the Harry Potter books (see Orrin's review) and make sure that they continue on through C.S. Lewis and on to Tolkien.

Well, of course I did eventually screw up my courage and tackle this daunting task and not only was I ensorceled by the story, but having finished I was naturally inordinately proud of myself.  Add that sense of self satisfaction into the mix and I'd imagine that for most kids who read the series at a certain age it inevitably becomes their favorite.  In fact, I'd like to get these kids who are so enraptured by the Harry Potter books (see Orrin's review) and make sure that they continue on through C.S. Lewis and on to Tolkien.  The Potter books are fun; Tolkien is sublime.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-11-25

This memoir, believe it or not, depicts two separate psychomachias, with poor George Stephanopoulos stuck in the middle.  First there is the struggle between his &quot;good&quot; liberal leanings and the &quot;evil&quot; pragmatism of Bill Clinton's politics.  Second, there is the struggle between the George who was raised a good Orthodox Christian and the &quot;bad&quot; George who is called upon to do Clinton's dirty work.  The tragedy of the story is that &quot;bad&quot; George surfaces time and again in order to serve &quot;evil.&quot;  He loses his soul twice, by committing morally dubious acts to further an agenda that he does not even believe in.  It's really quite painful to watch.<br />Stephanopoulos is the real deal, an unreconstructed bleeding heart liberal.  In 1992 he hoped to work for Mario Cuomo, someone who would proudly carry the liberal banner in to battle.  But the notorious Hamlet of the Hudson vacillated for so long that Stephanopoulos started to look around at other campaigns.  In an especially devastating sequence, he discusses meeting with Bob Kerrey and his staff, and deciding that their campaign was not worth taking seriously, that it was too messianic, too dependent on the personality of the candidate.  Then he meets with Bill Clinton and is genuinely impressed.  Though he does not feel that Clinton shares his ideology, Stephanopoulos decides:<br />  Maybe Clinton's more conservative side would make him more appealing.  Maybe it was time for  the party to sacrifice ideological purity for electoral potential.<br />In their first meeting, Clinton asks what he should do about a pledge declining PAC contributions.  Stephanopoulos advises:<br />  PAC money isn't morally worse than other contributions.  But attacking PACs is an easy sound bite  right now, so unless you can raise a ton, it's probably not worth ceding the high ground.  Besides,  Harkin's (Tom Harkin, IA) sucking up all of the labor money anyway.  You're not giving up as  much as you'd gain with the editorial boards.  I'd take the pledge.<br />It's worth pausing here, because this is before his association with the Clintons had completely corrupted Stephanopoulos, and look at that bit of advice.  There are a series of assumptions here:  (1) contributions are somehow morally questionable; (2) but PAC contributions are no worse than others; (3) if you're the one receiving them, you accept them and keep quiet; (4) because you aren't and your opponent is, you oppose them; and (5) this is the moral high ground.  Positioning yourself to denounce as immoral a behavior you would engage in if you could?  George may not have had that much to learn from Bill after all.<br />But he does become Bill's boy and there is an element of seduction here:<br />  ...I was moved by more than what he stood for or how much he knew.  It was how I felt around  him : uniquely known and needed, as if my contribution might make all the difference.  Clinton  spoke to the me yearning to be singled out for a special job--the boy who had wrapped his fingers  around the archbishop's staff and waved the censer in the path of his dad.<br />Without truckling in Freudian analysis here, you can't help noticing the psychosexual dynamic here and that bit about a &quot;special job&quot; and fingers wrapped around a staff, sounds like it could be lifted from Monica Lewinsky's book.<br />If the image of Clinton as lover and father stuff isn't enough, Stephanopoulos next compares him to Christ:<br />  The messianic streak in Kerrey's camp had left me cold.  But I was yielding to a similar temptation  with Clinton.  I barely knew him--one meeting, a couple of phone calls.  But the feeling I had when  we first met was taking root, putting him and his cause at the center of my life.  Maybe I couldn't  help it.  Maybe I had to romanticize the mission in order to survive the impossible hours, the  inevitable compromises, and the intense personal pressures that I knew would come with any  campaign.  Maybe I had to turn it into a crusade.  How it happened is still a mystery to me, but I  was on the road to becoming a true believer, developing an apostle's love for Clinton and the  adventure we were about to share.<br />This might not be so embarrassing if Clinton had a &quot;cause&quot; other than himself.  But Bill Clinton is the sum total of what Bill Clinton believes in, and so Stephanopoulos is placing nothing more than another person, and not much of one, at the center of his own life.<br />Within a short time, Stephanopoulos was fighting off bimbo eruptions, draft dodger stories, and all those myriad other rumors, innuendoes and, as we ultimately discovered, perfectly valid allegations.  Always in these situations it is Hillary who demands that the accuser be destroyed, while the candidate dissembles and prevaricates until the story has spun nearly out of control.  But these battles themselves have a certain allure:<br />  What began as a strange, even sordid, way to spend my time soon felt natural.  Wake me up in the  middle of the night, I could have told you all the lies in the Nichols story before I even opened my  eyes.  I began to think that doing dirty work was not necessary but noble, a landmark on the road to  greater good.  I began to fool myself, because fighting scandals can be fun; the action is  addictive.<br />Just as the candidate seemed addicted to getting into these messes, the staff seemed to become addicted to cleaning them up, regardless of the validity of the charges or the means they had to employ.  The pattern was set which would follow them to the White House and remains with us today (8/07/00).  Clinton triggers another scandal, Hillary demands that opponents be crushed, and the staff spins like crazy.<br />One of the remarkable things about the book is how little things changed once they won the election.  Campaign organizations are loose knit, flexible things, sometimes even chaotic.  Often they think tactically rather than strategically.  Appearance tends to seem more important than reality, because by the time anyone figures out the reality, the campaign has moved on or is even over.  And no matter how you dress it up, no matter how important the issues raised, they are ultimately really only concerned with one goal: to elect the candidate.  Despite the obvious weaknesses of this structure, it often suffices for the election.  But only people who are profoundly irresponsible would try running the nation the same way.  These are those people.<br />Other than Health Care, which Hillary took over, there weren't really any strategic plans for the administration, so they governed tactically.  For all the talk of FOBs (Friends of Bill), there just weren't many top notch folks in the cabinet or at the upper staff levels, so the whole operation was a mess.  The promise to have an administration that &quot;looked like America&quot; and the unfortunate Nanny-Gate brouhahas combined to leave them in the position of choosing appointees for who they were, rather than for what they were (in other words, female or Hispanic or whatever, instead of merely competent).  There are a few things that are especially troubling about the administration's start up.  First, that they were actually not appointing people because of the nanny nonsense.  Second, that they were incapable of drawing any broader lessons from the experience.  A more adept political operation might have taken note of the fact that even these upper class liberals were avoiding Social Security tax payments and used it as a jumping off point to reduce the payroll tax.  Instead, their sole focus was to trot out the next female victim, having predetermined that the Attorney General would be a woman come hell or high water.  This left us with the conveniently childless Janet Reno, who proceededto cook the Branch Davidians because of their unusual religious views.<br />The big accomplishment early in the Administration was passage of the Clinton economic plan.  Because of the inclusion of tax cuts, Republicans bailed out.  It was left, perversely, to Democrats to as Clinton said, become Eisenhower Republicans and pass a supposed deficit fighting package.  This was an important psychological moment because it represented at long lost a return of Democrats to the, at least somewhat, fiscally responsible fold, after seventy years of advocating increasing deficits.  But the plan itself was entirely inconsequential.  The economy, having readjusted to a peacetime footing, had already begun growing even before Bush left office.  The eventual balancing of the budget was completely a function of declining defense spending--$300 billion deficits turned into a balance budget as $300 billion was cut from defense, you do the math.  Passage of the plan did have the salutary effect of helping the GOP retake the Congress, which proved to be the best thing that ever happened to Bill Clinton, but from the perspective of folks like Stephanopoulos, the Democspins like crazy. <br />One of the remarkable things about the book is how little things changed once they won the election.

Charlie Croker is a 60 year old, good old boy, developer in Atlanta. A former star Georgia Tech halfback, his empire includes a game ranch, a frozen foods business and a white elephant of an office building that is bleeding him dry.  Judging his success purely by the accouterments, he appears to be doing okay, with a hottie trophy wife, a Gulf Stream 5, palatial houses, etc.  But his bankers smell blood in the water, one of them (Raymond Peepgass) has even secretly put together a syndicate to take over the office building at cut rate, and Charlie has to lay off some workers at the food business, including young Conrad Hensley, just to free up cash and buy some time.  Meanwhile, Georgia Tech's new star halfback, Fareek Fanon,  is being accused of raping the daughter of one of Charlie's wealthy society cronies.  Up and coming black attorney Roger White II (Roger Too White) has been called in to handle the defense and he offers Charlie a deal: speak out in support of Fareek at a press conference orchestrated by the mayor, and they'll get the bank to back off.  As Charlie wrestles with this decision, Conrad works his way across the country, converting to Stoicism in the process.  Their paths all meet when Conrad is assigned to Charlie as a physical therapist after knee surgery and shares the tenets of Stoicism with him.  With the press conference looming Charlie must decide whether to go along with Roger's plan, by praising Fareek, and save his empire and position in society or be true to himself, at the risk of losing everything and possibly causing race riots in Atlanta, and tell the truth, that Fareek, like many athletes, is shallow, self-centered, pampered and arrogant.<br />Of course, interspersed with this basic narrative, Wolfe provides the myriad details, learned expositions, social observations and zeitgeist probings for which he is justly famous.  These elements of the novel, if not quite up to the level of his best work (Radical Chic, Bauhaus to Our House, The Right Stuff and Bonfire), are still very funny, extremely insightful and wildly ambitious.  He really just blows the doors off of most other novelists, simply by being willing to attempt such a massive portrait of America.<br />If you just take that set up, it looks like this is merely an updating of Bonfire--rich guy's world collapsing, racial tension, etc..  But the real risk taking, the nearly masochistic reach that Wolfe makes here, is in his portrayal of Conrad Hensley.  For over thirty years, Wolfe has been a master of the social satire.  He has basically made a career out of pricking the gonfalon bubbles of America's most ostentatious and self-important cultural elites.  But once in a great while one of his subjects has managed to pierce the ironic veil and make him stumble.  The two who spring to mind most readily are the race car driver Junior Johnson (read his profile &quot;The Last American Hero&quot;) and Chuck Yeager (read Orrin's review of The Right Stuff).  Both of these men penetrated Wolfe's ironic detachment and he ended up portraying them as genuine unalloyed American heroes.  Now it's perfectly understandable that this point was lost in his pretty substantial corpus of work, but with Conrad it becomes clear what was going on all along; they are all Men in Full.<br />When Conrad is in prison and has just discovered the teachings of Epictetus and the other Stoics, he finds himself in a situation that clearly portends his own rape and asks:<br />  What would Epictetus have done with this bunch?  What could he have done?  How could you  apply his lessons two thousand years later, in this grimy gray pod, this pigsty full of beasts who  grunted about motherf***in' this and motherf***in' that and turning boys into B-cats and jookin'  punks?  And yet...were they really any worse than Nero and his Imperial Guard? Epictetus spoke to  him--from half a world and two thousand years away! The answer was somewhere in these  pages!  What little bit Conrad had learned about philosophy at Mount Diablo had seemed to concern  people who were free and whose main problem was to choose from among life's infinite  possibilities.  Only Epictetus began with the assumption that life is hard, brutal, punishing, narrow,  and confining, a deadly business, and that fairness and unfairness are beside the point.  Only  Epictetus, so far as Conrad knew, was a philosopher who had been stripped of everything,  imprisoned, tortured, enslaved, threatened with death.  And only Epictetus had looked his  tormenters in the eye and said, &quot;You do what you have to do, and I will do what I have to do,  which is live and die like a man.&quot;  And he had prevailed.<br />There in a nutshell is what Wolfe has been looking for throughout his decades long journey through the American landscape--modern successors to Epictetus, men who live and die like men, who simply do the right thing.  He had found two such men in Yeager and Johnson and now, for the first time, he has created a fictional character in their image.  And Conrad becomes the vehicle through which Wolfe demonstrates that there is still a tiny flame of genuine decency burning within modern man.<br />This is the point at which the book becomes truly remarkable.  Because Tom Wolfe--68, ill, depressed, snide, old Tom Wolfe--allows Charlie Croker to redeem himself.  What a symbol of hope the author holds out to us.  Charlie Croker who has been as caught up in the games and role playing of our vacuous modern world as any of the characters, real or fictional, that Wolfe has ever described, finds it within himself to become a man in full, to do the right thing, to live like a man.  It turns out that Wolfe is a romantic at heart.  His long career attacking pretense is suddenly cast in a different light.  It turns out he's been trying to get us to strip away our materialist, politically correct, corporatist, conformist, opportunistic outer selves and become Stoics.  Many of the critics refer to this book as Wolfe's most humane work and it is to this realization that they are unknowingly referring.  After thirty some odd years of poking fun at people, we find out that he's trying to save their souls.<br />Of course, all of this is an invitation to ridicule.  It's bad enough if you are merely a brilliant conservative.  Worse still to be one of the great journalists of all time, and a conservative.  Much worse to be a great novelist, and a conservative.  But now, here comes the worst blow of all; you just can't be a brilliant journalist/novelist who's a compassionate conservative; you overload the circuits.  But at the end of the day that is what we are left with.  Radical Chic and Right Stuff established him as a first rate journalist.  Bonfire and Man in Full elevate him to the first rank of novelists.  If his politics weren't galling enough before, here he is juxtaposing an AID's benefit with a prison rape and calling on us to return to a moral philosophy that predates (and influenced) Christ.  And here, in the twilight of his career, it becomes obvious that the Conrad Hensleys and the human possibilities of a Charlie Croker are central to his vision of man.  No wonder the reviews are so wildly contradictory and even self-contradictory.  The left wing establishment does not even seem to understand what Wolfe has set out to do, but what they do understand, they clearly don't like.<br />Take a look at what the critics take issue with in his work.  Wolfe's critics dislike his politics.  Well of course they do, his moral politics are fundamentally two millenia old and profoundly conservative.  They say his female characters are weak.  Of course they are; he's uninterested in women. All of his work turns out to be an attempt to understand modern men.  They say he only presents characters' surface personae, not their inner beings.  That's his point; we've abandoned our inner beings, our natural selves, and we live the lives we project to people.  The essence of the Wolfe critique--from Radical Chic, to the Apollo program, to modern art--is that modern man is hollow.  Like C.S. Lewis' &quot;men without chests&quot;, they lack a moral core and so every passing fade or fancy is manifested in their outer beings.  Lacking any internal compass for moral guidance, they follow the herd like lemmings.  Are gay rights popular?  Fine, I'm pro gay!  Indian rights are big?  I feel Native American pain!  Those paint splatter things that my two year old could do are worth $5 million?  Jackson Pollack is a genius!  You tell me what attitude is at 50% in the polls and that's how I feel.  Throughout his career, Wolfe has been throwing these forms of political correctness back in the faces of the literatti and the glitteratti.  So, yes, each of these criticisms is absolutely accurate.  In fact, they are the point of his writing. The critics just happen to have, typically, missed the point.  And so, instead of giving Aat heart.

I think literature's value is  in making those connections. That's the mission of literature. Morals are significant.  -Kenzaburo Oe<br />Kenzaburo Oe is probably the most highly regarded of Japan's post-war novelists and A Personal Matter is certainly his best known book.  It is the harrowing, semi-autobiographical story of a parent's worst nightmare and of a brutal moral dilemma.  As the novel opens, the twenty-something protagonist, whose immaturity is reflected in the fact that he retains his boyhood nickname of Bird, anxiously awaits the birth of his first child, but dreams of escaping his mundane domestic life in Japan and traveling instead to Africa.  When Bird's son is born with a herniated brain--one doctor nervously giggles that it looks like he has two heads--he faces a choice between starving the child to death or financing exorbitantly expensive surgery with little chance of success.  Even a successful operation is likely to cause significant brain damage.<br />Overwhelmed, Bird seeks to avoid his responsibilities by twittering--like his namesake--between alcohol, an old girlfriend and his African fantasies, avoiding his job, his wife, his child and most of all, the decisions which need to be made.  Just hours after finally delivering the child to a back alley abortionist who will kill him and preparing to use the money he has saved up not on the prospective surgical procedures, but to run away to Africa with his girlfriend, Bird has an epiphany in a gay bar and, at last, determines to grow up and accept the mantle of responsibility that he has always sought to avoid.  The story ends with the baby having been successfully operated on, though his future mental development remains in doubt, and with Bird's father-in-law telling him that his childish nickname is no longer appropriate because he is a changed man.<br />It is an open secret that the Nobel Prize has become little more than a politically correct constituency plum in recent years, so the prospect of reading a novel by an eminent left-wing Japanese novelist honestly filled me with dread.  I was totally unprepared for this fierce, beautiful passion play and was pleasantly surprised by the stark, noirish prose style of Oe's writing.  The brutally direct sentences of this brief novel present an unforgettable portrait of a man wrestling with a stark moral choice, one that lies at the center of much of our own politics, but which is seldom faced honestly.  The fact that Oe's own son was born with a herniated brain only serves to add another layer of tension to an already unbearably tense tale.  When Bird chooses life and himself becomes a man it is truly one of the most moving and gratifying moments of spiritual triumph in all of literature.  Bird emerges as a heroic but very human figure.  I can't imagine any reader being unaffected by this book; in fact, I can easily imagine readers being haunted by it.

Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction in November 1949.  Respective stories were gathered together into the three volumes: Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952) and Second Foundation (1953).  Finally, the whole shebang was published as The Foundation Trilogy in 1961 and in 1966, won a Hugo Award as the best science fiction series of all time.  I don't know that this last is still true, but it is certainly one of the seminal works in the history of Science Fiction and remains extraordinarily influential.<br />Oliver Morton, in The New Yorker of May 17, 1999, had an excellent essay about the books wherein he pointed out that Asimov is really responsible for the concept, so prevalent in science fiction, of the Galactic Empire.  He particularly demonstrates the debt that the Star Wars series owes to Asimov's vision, a vision which apparently in turn owes a debt to Edward Gibbon, whose Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire Asimov had read twice as a young man.<br />He also draws one important distinction; where the main foundation of the Star Wars series is speed (iconified by the image of the accelerating starship), the Foundation series is built upon size.  It is the epic scope, spanning thousands of years and worlds and incorporating billions of people, that really made Foundation so groundbreaking.  It enabled Asimov to apply historical themes to a genre that, virtually by definition, lacked history.<br />All of this is certainly true, but it strikes me that the epic scope as utilized by Asimov presents a political/philosophical problem.  Asimov posited a future science of psychohistory, a discipline which would bring scientific cause and effect certainty to the field of human affairs.  The Trilogy traces the fall and reemergence of a Galactic Empire with the entire process having been predicted by and, to some extent guided by, Hari Seldon, the Founder of Psychohistory.  This premise manages to combine two of the worst ideas that human's have ever had--first, that history is deterministic and follows some kind of iron clad pattern; second, that there is any merit to psychology, particularly  as a predictive tool when applied to large populations over a lengthy period of time.<br />The whole thing is sort of creepy in so far as it dismisses free will and the impact of ideas and individuals on man's development.  The quest for discernible patterns and laws in human existence is nothing new, most religions are predicated on the revelation of such hidden patterns.  And it is natural for scientists to be attracted to the idea that there are certain universal laws that will eventually explain our behavior, everything from why we love or why we kill to why I just typed the letter r.  But I for one, do not believe that our lives are predetermined.  In fact, I find such an idea pretty bleak and antihuman.<br />I still recommend the series, particularly in light of the influence it has had on the genre and for the massive scope of Asimov's vision, but, for me at least, the Freudian &amp; Hegelian overtones are a little bit off-putting.<br />GRADE: A-f Psychohistory.

Repelled by the changes that the Industrial Revolution had brought to Britain, he yearned for more pastoral times.  By profession a Medievalist, he translated Norse sagas and printed them in beautiful editions.  An artist and founder of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, he designed many of the flowery tapestries and wallpapers that we associate with the Victorian drawing room.  Politically he was a utopian Socialist.  And, as Carter says, as a writer he helped to create the fantasy novel.  In all of these pursuits he harkened back to an idealized past, no where more so than in his writing.<br />The language, style and story of this novel lend it an aura of antiquity, as if it too was merely a translation of some medieval romance.  The hero of the story, Golden Walter, flees his home upon realizing that his new bride hates him.  Sailing forth on one of his merchant father's ships, his fate becomes intertwined with a mysterious trio: a splendid lady, her evil dwarf servant and a young maiden whom the lady has enslaved.  Walter pursues the trio beyond the reaches of his own world to The Golden House, governed by the lady, known only as The Mistress.  There he will battle the dwarf, free the maiden, with whom he has fallen in love, and together they will flee the Mistress.<br />Though Morris may have intended to recall a lost past, he truly does create a unique world of his own.

Dr. Haber can be seen as any intellectual who conceives a better way for society and then seeks to impose it, completely failing to understand the unintended consequences which this action will inevitably have.  George Orr, meanwhile, understands that the power to shape reality is too dangerous to entrust to any one man or group of men. It is better to let the future evolve naturally and preserve Man's free will, even if this means not stepping in to &quot;fix&quot; some situations that seem amenable to his personal solutions.

Meanwhile, I'd never heard of him and when the book got some good reviews over here, it was a NY Times notable book, I couldn't find it anywhere.  Bur I'm glad I finally got ahold of a copy, because the novel lives up to the hype.<br />Priest tells the story of two turn of the century magicians, Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden, who are first rivals and then bitter enemies as what starts out as an attempt to learn each others secrets deteriorates into obsessive hatred and is even handed down to succeeding generations.  Eventually their efforts to top one anothers latest tricks draw Nikola Tesla into the picture.  Angier travels to Colorado to see if Tesla's experiments with electricity have any magical implications.  They do and the results are predictably, but delightfully, horrifying.<br />It's pretty hard to describe this novel without giving too much of the story away.  It's also a story that invites comparison; I saw reviewer references to The Alienist, Robertson Davies, John Fowles, H.G.

Life itself, the phenomenon of life, the gift of life, is so  breathtakingly serious!  -Boris Pasternak<br />Most of us are only familiar with Doctor Zhivago from the epic David Lean film version (indeed this is one of the books I come across most frequently at book sales, almost always unread).  The movie is beautiful but strangely inert, has a somewhat disjointed narrative and conveys no clear philosophical message--flaws which I always assumed were a function of the difficulty of converting a Russian novel to film and the inexplicable casting of two really awful actors (Omar Sharif &amp; Julie Christie) in the lead roles.  But now, having reread the novel, it seems to me that these weaknesses are inherent in the novel.  Just as Lean seemed most interested in the story as a vehicle for presenting cinematic images, the real life in Pasternak comes less from the narrative itself than from the poetry that Zhivago produces.  And the message of the novel, assuming that there is one, is presented awfully subtly.<br />Zhivago himself, the name means &quot;life&quot; in Russian, is a pretty docile leading man.  The story follows him as he is buffeted by the winds of change in Russia from 1903 to his death sometime after WWII.  We can take at least a twofold message from the novel.  Pasternak seems first of all to be speaking out, however obliquely, against a system which denies life and destroys artists, as the Soviet regime had.  However, he also seems to be saying that the artist is relatively helpless against the tides of history.  It is ironic in light of this that Pasternak became such a cause celebre.  A good deal of this novel's reputation surely rests on the Western reaction to Soviet efforts to quash it.  Perhaps I've simply lost the ability to read between the lines of samizdat, but I thought the condemnation of Communist Russia in the book was exceedingly mild, almost too much so.  And there is one section in particular, right at the end of the book, where Pasternak waxes optimistically over how the nation may be entering a period of renewed freedom now that the war has been won.  This kind of wishful thinking comes across as incredibly naive.  I guess I too will have to fall back on the reaction that the novel provoked and assumed that even such feathery criticism as the book contains was important in crystallizing opposition to the regime.<br />But Doctor Zhivago is understood to be semi autobiographical and to the extent that Zhivago is acted upon rather than acting himself, perhaps he is intended to convey Pasternak's own ambivalence about the role he had played by remaining in Soviet Union and continuing to work. Indeed, there is a really poignant moment in Isaiah Berlin's piece on the author, where Pasternak, near desperation, seeks to solicit Berlin's opinion on whether people believe that he has collaborated with the government because he remained in the USSR or whether they instead accept that he felt compelled to stay.  In fairness to Pasternak, it should not be necessary to leave a country (as did Solzhenitsyn) or be disappeared (as was Isaac Babel) or be imprisoned (as were countless others) in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of your opposition to an evil government.<br />To be honest, the subtlety of Pasternak's message and our increasing distance from the time when even such subtleties could prove incendiary, served to deaden the effect of a novel which already suffers from being a tad too episodic.  In the final analysis, I guess I respected the book more than enjoyed it and found it more interesting as a key artifact of an age that is quickly receding from memory than compelling as a novel.<br />GRADE: B-section in particular, right at the end of the book, where Pasternak waxes optimistically over how the nation may be entering a period of renewed freedom now that the war has been won.

Firemen are responsible for burning books; all of which are banned, so that the people of this dystopia will not be troubled by difficult thoughts.  Instead of reading, they watch endless soap operas on large screen TV's and the government provides for all their needs.  Guy has had some qualms about his job, but he's never really thought through exactly what it is he's doing.  But then, in short order, he meets an odd young neighborhood girl named Clarisse McClellan, his wife nearly kills herself with sleeping pills and, finally, when the firemen are called to an old woman's house, she refuses to leave:<br />  Montag placed his hand on the woman's elbow.  &quot;You can come with me,&quot;<br />  &quot;No,&quot; she said.  &quot;Thank you, anyway.&quot;<br />  &quot;I'm counting to ten,&quot; said Beatty.  &quot;One.

She opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of  the hand was a single slender object.<br />  An ordinary kitchen match.<br />And before they can light the fire, she lights it herself and Guy is forced to consider what it is about books that would make a person do such a thing.  As he tells his wife:<br />  Last night I thought about all the kerosene I've used in the past ten years.  And I though about  books.  And for the first time I realized that a man was behind each one of the books.  A man had  to think them up.  A man had to take a long time to put them down on paper.  And I'd never  thought of that before.<br />As it turns out, the old woman has, like Hugh Latimore, lit a fire that will change the world, because Guy joins the nascent resistance to the book-burning government.<br />He remembers meeting an old man named Faber in a park some time earlier and the hunch he had that the man had a book.  Indeed, when Guy tracks him down, it turns out that Faber was a professor and he explains to Guy why books are of value:<br />  Number one, ... quality of information.  Number two: leisure to digest it.  And number three: the  right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the interaction of the first two.<br />Each bolstering the other's confidence, Guy and Faber set out to resist the system and, ultimately, Guy escapes to the wilderness beyond the city, where wandering bands of men are preserving great texts in memory, against the day when the knowledge is needed and learning is again valued.<br />While not quite in a league with Orwell or Koestler, Bradbury's classic tale is an important treatment of the central themes of the century (of every century).

We head to the new millennium in the midst of the most spectacular flowering of Freedom that the world has ever known, but there is a continual tension in the species, between those who value that freedom, whatever its costs, and those who would choose the security offered by a controlled society and those who are afraid of uncomfortable ideas. freedom has the upper hand, but the struggle continues...<br />GRADE: A-had      to think them up.

Schuyler was one of the premier black journalists of his, or any other, day.  Between his own acerbic style and being published in The American Mercury, he was referred to as the Black Mencken.  In addition, he wrote one great satirical novel, Black No More, and a fair amount of pulp fiction.  Two of those pulp titles, The Black Internationale : Story of Black Genius Against the World and the sequel, Black Empire : An Imaginative Story of a Great New Civilization in Modern Africa, are reproduced here in one volume.  Written under the pseudonym, Samuel I . Brooks, for a black weekly newspaper, The Pittsburgh Courier,  these sixty two serial installments in an ongoing adventure story originally appeared between 1936 and 1938.<br />Reminiscent of Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu, Schuyler tells the story of Carl Slater, writer for the Harlem Blade, who accidentally witnesses the murder of a white woman.  The black assailant forces Slater into a waiting car at gunpoint, whereupon he is drugged.  When he wakens, the murderer reveals himself to be Dr. Henry Belsidus, leader of the Black Internationale, an elite organization of black professionals whom the Doctor plans to lead in his mission to liberate Africa and restore blacks to their rightful position of dominance on the world stage.  He explains that the woman had been one of his agents and her murder was punishment for failure.  It turns out that Slater was on a list of blacks whom Belsidus planned to eventually recruit to his cause, and now circumstances force him to choose between joining up or being killed.  He joins.<br />Dr. Belsidus is clearly maniacal, but he is also possessed of a compelling vision :<br />  My son, all great schemes appear mad in the beginning.  Christians, Communists, Fascists and Nazis  were at first called scary.  Success made them sane.  With brains, courage and wealth even the most  fantastic scheme can become a reality.  I have dedicated my life, Slater, to destroying white world  supremacy.  My ideal and objective is very frankly to cast down Caucasians and elevate the colored  people in their places.  I plan to do this by every means within my power.  I intend to stop at  nothing, Slater, whether right or wrong.  Right is success.  Wrong is failure.  I will not fail because  I am ruthless.  Those who fail are them men who get sentimental, who weaken, who balk at a little  bloodshed.  Such vermin deserve to fail.  Every great movement the world has ever seen has  collapsed because it grew weak.  I shall never become weak, nor shall I ever tolerate weakness  around me.  Weakness means failure, Slater, and I do not intend to fail.<br />In the ensuing chapters he realizes this vision, along the way utilizing such visionary technological wizardry as solar power, hydroponics and death rays, and such social measures as as his own new religion, the Church of Love.  Carl Slater witnesses it all and--at the behest of Schuyler's editors and readers--falls in love with Patricia Givens, the beautiful aviatrix who commands the Black Internationale's Air Force.  The serial ends with Belsidus and his followers triumphant and white Europe expelled from Africa.<br />Stylistically this is pretty standard fare, following the over-the-top, melodramatic, cliff-hanging, conventions of the pulp fiction formula.  It's well written and exciting, though overwrought.  What really makes it interesting though is it's politics.  Schuyler, particularly late in life, was a conservative.  He moved farther Right as he became more vehemently anti-Communist and finished his career writing for publications put out by the John Birch Society (see hyperlinked Essays below). Part of this evolution entailed becoming generally hostile to the Civil Rights movement and to African Nationalism, but apparently in the 1930's he was himself a Pan-Africanist, especially concerned with the fate of Ethiopia after the Italians invaded and with liberating Liberia.  There's a tendency to dismiss blackconservatives as somehow self-loathing, as if conservative values are necessarily at odds with the advancement of the black race.  And you can see something of a dichotomy in Schuyler's writings if you take for instance one of his comments on Marcus Garvey, of whom he was generally skeptical :<br />  Marcus Garvey has a vision.  He sees plainly that everywhere in the Western and Eastern  hemispheres the Negro, regardless of his religion or nationality, is being crushed under the heel of  white imperialism and exploitation.  Rapidly the population of the world is being aligned in two  rival camps: white and black.  The whites have arms, power, organization, wealth; the blacks have  only their intelligence and their potential power.  If they are to be saved, they must be organized so  they can present united opposition to those who seek to continue their enslavement. (George S.  Schuyler, writing in the Interstate Tattler, August 23, 1929)<br />and compare it to what he had to say about the success of Black Empire :<br />  I have been greatly amused by the public enthusiasm for 'The Black Internationale,' which is  hokum and hack work of the purest vein.  I deliberately set out to crowd as much race chauvinism  and sheer improbability into it as my fertile imagination could conjure.  The result vindicates my  low opinion of the human race.  (George S. Schuyler, from a Letter to P.L. Prattis, April 4, 1937)<br />Taken at face value, he seems to be criticizing his black readership for enjoying stories based on the vision he had extolled in Garvey.<br />But perhaps this conflict is more easily reconciled than critics would have us believe.  Throughout his career, Schuyler seems to have been entirely consistent in his hostility towards those who sought to speak for blacks.  It is this general stance which explains his opposition to Garvey, Communists, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and so on.  In Black Empire, he presents Belsidus as quite a monster, willing to use mass murder and near genocide to achieve his ends.  It's easy to read the story as reflecting both his most treasured dream--the triumph of blacks over racial oppression--and his inherent pessimism about the leaders and means that would be required to achieve that goal.<br />At any rate, the story is great fun and Schuyler's personal conflicts only serve to add a few layers of tension.  The reader is often unsure whether he's writing with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek or whether he's allowing characters to speak his own forbidden thoughts.  That you can read it on various levels merely adds to the enjoyment.  There's also a terrific Afterword by Robert A. Hill and R. Kent Rasmussen, from which I gleaned much of the information in this review.  Altogether, it's a marvelous book and the Northeastern Library of Black Literature is to be applauded for restoring it to print.

It had an intriguing basic premise, but the nuances of the story kept getting lost amidst all the exploding heads.  The movie is based, like the equally uneven Blade Runner (see Orrin's review of the book), on the work of the cult favorite sci-fi author, Philip K. Dick.  But while movie tie-in versions of Blade Runner abound (Dick's original, more descriptive, title was Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?), Total Recall is based on just a short story, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, which is harder to find.  Until that is I stumbled upon this cheesy looking, but gem filled, collection of stories by various authors, each of which is the basis for a recent science fiction film.<br />Dick's original short story is, predictably, a great improvement over the film, idea-filled rather than action-packed.  While Douglas Quail may be a miserable little salaried employee, for the West Coast Emigration Bureau, he has one abiding dream, &quot;Before I die I'll see Mars.&quot;  Such a trip though would be enormously expensive and his wife constantly derides his ambition.  Lucky for him, Rekal, Incorporated, can implant it's customers with false memories that will make it seem as if they've actually experienced their fondest dreams:<br />  Was this the answer?  After all, an illusion, no matter how convincing, remained nothing more  than an illusion.  At least objectively.  But subjectively--quite the opposite entirely.<br />So Quail goes to Rekal for the Mars &quot;extra-factual memory implant,&quot; complete with a scenario that has him acting as an agent for Interplan.  Then, as the process gets underway, an unusual thing happens; under sedation he begins to recover genuine memories of a past trip to Mars.  As one of the technicians explains:<br />  He wants a false memory implanted that corresponds to a trip he actually took.  And a false reason  which is the real reason.  He's telling the truth; he's a long way down in the narkidrine.  The trip  is very vivid in his mind--at least under sedation.  But apparently he doesn't recall it otherwise.  Someone, probably at a government military-sciences lab, erased his conscious memories; all he  knew was that going to Mars meant something special to him, and so did being a secret agent.  They couldn't erase that; it's not a memory but a desire, undoubtedly the same one that motivated  him to volunteer for the assignment in the first place.<br />Realizing the gravity of their situation, the folks at Rekal hustle him out the door and refund half his money.  But now Quail starts to get fragmentary memories of a Mars trip, some from the implant and some from the real trip, so he returns to Rekal to get the matter straightened out.  Meanwhile, agents from Interplan, who have been monitoring his thoughts against just such an eventuality, show up to try and kill him before he can reveal the details of his secret mission to Mars.  Quail convinces them to have another try at implanting false memories, but this time the genuine memories that are recovered are even more bewildering.<br />It's a clever, twisty story, somewhat reminiscent of a really good Twilight Zone.  In addition, over the space of just twenty or so pages, Dick raises some unsettling questions about memory, desire, delusion and reality, and how they all interact in the human mind.  Total Recall is a perfectly adequate way to kill a couple hours; We Can Remember it For You Wholesale, though it takes just a half hour to read, will keep you pondering for a good long while.<br />GRADE: Aa trip he actually took.

He works as a securities analyst &amp; he's become engaged. He's a decent kind-hearted soul who never passes a beggar without digging out some change. Then one night on the way to dinner with his fiancee, the tatterdemalion who he stops to help turns out to be an injured young girl named Door. He takes her back to his apartment  &amp; shortly is visited by Mr. Croup &amp; Mr. Vandemar, two vicious looking men in Victorian dress. He is unable to stop them from searching the apartment, but they do not find Door. When she comes out of hiding, she asks him to carry a message for her. He agrees &amp; goes to fetch the mysterious marquis de Carabas, who takes Door away.<br />With these odd people out of his life, Richard tries to resume his life, but discovers that he has become a non-person. His bank card doesn't work, friends don't recognize him &amp; many people don't even appear to see him. He sets out to try to find out what happened &amp; ends up in London Below, a bizarre city that exists in some kind of parallel reality beneath the streets of the City.  Finding Door and de Carabas, he joins them in a quest to destroy the Beast of London and find the angel Islington.<br />It seemed to me that Gaiman's story owed a tremendous debt to Christopher Fowler, but Fowler is largely unknown here &amp; Gaiman's book made various best-of lists, so more power to him.<br />GRADE: B	2000-11-25

Wells and Jules Verne virtually created the Science Fiction novel.  In a period of less than 4 years, Wells wrote three seminal classics of the genre: The Time Machine (1895), The Invisible Man (1897) and The War of the Worlds (1898).  The Invisible Man, which owes an obvious debt to Frankenstein, is based on one of the eternal themes of mankind and one of the perennial themes of Science Fiction.  First, it explores the nature of man by asking whether an invisible man would still be bound by normal morality.  Second, it develops the theme of science as a two edged sword; after initially conveying great power, scientific innovation turns on its wielder, driving him mad.  One hundred years later, this ambivalence about technology and scientific progress has remained a central part of our culture.<br />As in all of the best books of the genre he helped to create, Wells combines these speculations with an exciting, fanciful tale.  He and Verne truly set their successors a lofty standard to aspire towards.<br />GRADE: A-	2000-11-25

The Finnys of the world are characterized by an easy physical grace which provides them with a spooky kind of preternatural self-assurance that sets them apart and makes them seem superior, particularly during the awkward teen years, when most of us are/were completely devoid of such confidence in ourselves.  This gift tends to be mistaken, as Gene mistakes it, for a moral quality.  In fact, it is anything but.<br />The fearlessness that Phineas displays is precisely that; he feels no fear and, therefore, demonstrates no courage by his actions.  It is the boys who feel fear, but conquer it and jump anyway who demonstrate true courage.  However, they are also demonstrating stupidity and a disturbing sheeplike quality in following Finny's example.  And this is the other thing about the Finnys of the world, they lead others into situations which are bound to end in disaster.  Because their grace has always given them a special form of protection, they assume that nothing bad can happen to them and they simply don't understand or care what might happen to others less gifted.  This utter carelessness even redounds to their favor.  Suppose that earlier in the story, when Gene lost his balance, that Finny had not been able to grab him and prevent his fall, would anyone have blamed Finny?  No.  Would Finny have genuinely blamed himself?  Oh sure, he would have accepted blame and folks would have been proud of how nobly he behaved, but would he have truly accepted the fact that he had caused the fall and the injury or would he, and others, have actually believed that the fault lay in Gene, that he was simply unequal to the task and had even shown himself to be inferior to Finny?<br />Knowles tiptoes right up to this point when Gene realizes:<br />  It was only after dinner, when I was on my way alone to the library, that the full danger I had  brushed on the limb shook me again.  If Finny hadn't come up right behind me...if he hadn't been  there... I could have fallen on the bank and broken my back!  if I had fallen awkwardly enough I  could have been killed.  Finny had practically saved my life.<br />  Yes, he had practically saved my life.  He had also practically lost it for me.  I wouldn't have turned  around, and so lost my balance, if he hadn't been there.  I didn't need to feel any tremendous rush  of gratitude toward Phineas.<br />But of course Gene is at heart a follower, one of the enablers so overawed by Phineas that he can not see through to the logical implications of this intuition.<br />Nor does he understand the manner in which Phineas warps situations to his own benefit.  The Super Suicide Society of the Summer Session naturally rewards Finny's own lack of fear.  The game he invents, blitzball, is likewise uniquely crafted to suit his own skills:<br />  Blitzball was the surprise of the summer.  Everybody played it; I believe a form of it is still popular  at Devon.  But nobody can be playing it as it was played by Phineas.  He had unconsciously  invented a game which brought his own athletic gifts to their highest pitch.  ...<br />  Right from the start, it was clear that no one had ever been better adapted to a sport than Finny was  to blitzball.  I saw that right away.  Why not?  he had made it up, hadn't he?  It needn't be  surprising that he was sensationally good at it, and that the rest of us were more or less bumblers in  our different ways.<br />So when he controls situations and plays to his own strengths, he excels.  But what of situations he can't control?  Is he an indifferent student?--then academics must not matter.  And this is what finally prods Gene to his precipitous action; when he realizes that Finny discounts the thing that Gene excels at and is therefore not jealous of his academic achievement in the way that Gene envies Finny's physical prowess, it is too much for him to stand and he shakes Finny off of the branch.<br />When Phineas returns to school, the boys enter a realm of unreality where his specialness remains unthreatened.  They pretend that the injury is temporary and he will be back in action soon.  Finny even refuses to acknowledge the reality of WWII; obviously if he can't participate in this ultimate physical test, it's very existence must be denied.  It is at this exact point in the story that Knowles uses the phrase &quot;separate peace&quot;, during the Winter Carnival which Finny organizes.  And in fact this is a separate moment, the last moment when Finny is a significant person in the lives of these boys.  As the carnival is winding down, Gene receives the telegram from Leper and suddenly the War is undeniable.  Since Phineas can not go to War, he is destined to become a minor figure instead of the center of attention that has been previously.  At this point he becomes a real figure of pity because we perceive, though he and Gene do not, that he has nothing to fall back on.  Here we see the fundamental shallowness of his prior status, based as it was solely on natural physical attributes and not upon anything for which he was personally responsible.  Sure he was able to excel when he chose the games and set the rules.  What is left of the Golden Boy when he faces a game &amp; rules that are beyond his control?  Remarkably little.  Because everything has come easy to him, Phineas has never developed character.  He is a hollow man.<br />One of the great movie scenes of all time occurs in Ordinary People (read Orrin's review), when Timothy Hutton finally has his epiphany and realizes that he survived the boating accident because he was simply a stronger person than his Phineas-like brother.  I vividly recall how cathartic this moment was, but I had never fully realized that one of the subliminal reasons is that in some sense we are glad that Buck drowns, that when push comes to shove it's enormously satisfying to see the hard working kid win and the kid who's always had it easy fold in the face of adversity.<br />I don't think that, in A Separate Peace, Gene is much better than Phineas.  The kids who follow along and judge themselves against the Phineas/Buck standard are little better than the Golden Boys themselves.  I much prefer the loners who simply reject those standards to begin with and thereby fail to fit in, but preserve their own set of core values, which is why I react to the Phineas character with such visceral loathing.  I would never have done, nor do I condone, what Gene did, but I feel a sense of cosmic justice at work, that this is just Phineas reaping what he has sown.<br />Finally, a question occurs.  Do parents who send their kids away to private school ever read any of the fiction those schools have produced?  Winston Churchill's memoir My Early Life, Robert Musil's Young Torless, The Power of One, this book--the literature of the private school is one long litany of brutality, sodomy, homoeroticism, homosexuality, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum.  The more you read, the more convinced you become that most young men simply do not have sufficiently armored personalities at their tender ages to withstand the hothouse atmosphere that these places engender.  I saw somewhere that after the book came out Knowles' Mom said to him that she was sorry she didn't realize how unhappy he was at Philips Exeter (upon which the story is based) and that he said he wasn't unhappy.  Boy, it sure seems like a cry for help to me.<br />This could be an invaluable book for teaching kids, to help them understand the universality of their own insecurities and to perceive their peers more clearly.  One doubts that is how it is taught, which instead makes it a somewhat dangerous book.

Each Letter is a beautifully crafted description of how the forces of evil seek to subvert good men and turn them away from Christianity.  Take the following example:<br />  My dear Wormwood,  So you &quot;have great hopes that the patient's religious phase is dying  away,&quot; have you? I always thought the Training College had gone to  pieces since they put old Slubgob at the head of it, and now I am sure.  Has no one ever told you about the law of Undulation?<br />  Humans are amphibians--half spirit and half animal. (The Enemy's  determination to produce such a revolting hybrid was one of the things  that determined Our Father to withdraw his support from Him.) As  spirits they belong to the eternal world, but as animals they inhabit  time.<br />  This means that while their spirits can be directed to an eternal object,  their bodies, passions, and imaginations are in continual change, for to  be in time means to change. Their nearest approach to constancy,  therefore, is undulation--the repeated return to a level from which they  repeatedly fall back, a series of troughs and peaks.<br />  If you had watched your patient carefully, you would have seen this  undulation in every department of his life--his interest in his work, his  affection for his friends, his physical appetites, all go up and down. As  long as he lives on earth, periods of emotional and bodily richness and  liveliness will alternate with periods of numbness and poverty. The  dryness and dullness through which your patient is now going are not,  as you fondly suppose, your workmanship; they are merely a natural  phenomenon which will do us no good unless you make a good use of  it.<br />  To decide what the best use of it is, you must ask what use the Enemy  wants to make of it, and then do the opposite.... in His efforts to get  permanent possession of a soul, He relies on the troughs even more  than on the peaks; some of His special favourites have gone through  longer and deeper troughs than anyone else.<br />  The reason is this. To us a human is primarily food; our aim is the  absorption of its will into ours, the increase of our own area of  selfhood at its expense.<br />  But the obedience the Enemy demands of men is quite a different  thing.... He really does want to fill the universe with a lot of loathsome  little replicas of Himself--creatures whose life, on its miniature scale,  will be qualitatively like His own, not because He has absorbed them  but because their wills freely conform to His.<br />  We want cattle who can finally become food; He wants servants who  can finally become sons. We want to suck in, He wants to give out.  We are empty and would be filled; He is full and flows over. Our war  aim is a world in which Our Father Below has drawn all other beings  into himself: the Enemy wants a world full of beings united to Him but  still distinct.<br />  And that is where the troughs come in.... Merely to override a human  will (as His felt presence in any but the faintest and most mitigated  degree would certainly do) would be for Him useless. He cannot  ravish. He can only woo....<br />Now obviously I like that because it jibes with my view of the Human Dilemma.  Even better is this, from Lewis's Introduction:<br />  I live in the Managerial Age, in a world of &quot;Admin.&quot;  The greatest evil is not now done in those  sordid &quot;dens of crime&quot; that Dickens loved to paint.  It is not done even in concentration camps and  labour camps.  In those we see its final result.  But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded,  carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white  collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.  Hence  naturally enough, my symbol for Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the  offices of a thoroughly nasty business concern.<br />This metaphor, of course, proved to be more prescient than even Lewis could have forseen.  For as the Letters were being published, bureaucrats in Berlin and Moscow were exterminating humans by the millions and the Depression and the War would give rise to increasing huge and intrusive Welfare State bureaucracies, bent on destroying Religion, Family, Community, any institution which could rival the power of the State.  All the while, and ever so gradually, citizens were willingly ceding more and more of their autonomy (their hard won Free Will), as we slid into the modern Liberal godless Hell.<br />To read Lewis now is to realize that things could have been different; that a few voices, crying in the wilderness, warned of the authoritarian netherworld that Western man exiled himself to for much of this Century as he abandoned God and Christianity in favor of the State and statism.  We are now in the midst of a twilight struggle that will decide whether we retain sufficient confidence in our ultimate godliness to reclaim our freedom from the grasp of the State, or whether Western man's crisis of confidence will lead us back to the Garden of Eden, with our needs taken care of and our souls extinguished.<br />There is no better way to gird yourself for the battle than to read this book.<br />Grade: A+We want cattle who can finally become food; He wants servants who                               can finally become sons.

He lives for the Brooklyn Dodgers, comic books, Saturday matinees and his Mother who was widowed during the War.  But now his whole insular world is about to change.  The Dodgers have a new player and he's black.  Michael has a new friend and he's a Jewish rabbi--Judah Hirsch, a refugee from the Holocaust.  And Michael and the rabbi have offended the local gang of Irish toughs, The Falcons and their brutal leader, Frankie McCarthy.  Just when it seemed that the War had vanquished evil, it turns out that the malevolent forces of racism and hatred have a foothold in Michael's own neighborhood.  In order to survive,  Michael, his mother and the rabbi have to call upon resources that they don't even realize that they possess, including even the dreadful Golem of Jewish mystic tradition.<br />I'm not a huge Pete Hamill fan and the political agendas that are at work here are a little bit heavy handed (particularly in one fight scene at Ebbett's Field).  But I'm as big a sucker as anybody for those magical fantasies of boyhood (see Boy's Life by Robert McCammon, Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury, etc.) and what really makes this book a terrific read is the relationship between Michael and Rabbi Hirsch.  Michael's friends originally put him up to finding the secret buried treasure of the Jews that they think lies buried within the synagogue.  But as Michael helps the rabbi with his English and teaches him about America and the rabbi in turn teaches him Yiddish and unfolds the beauties of preWar Europe, Michael discovers that the real secret treasure is love of learning.<br />Despite some scenes that may be excessively violent for younger readers, the emphasis on education and shared experience and love of words and literature is so compelling, that you hope that teens will read and love the book.  And if the whole schtick with the Golem is a little bit over the top, I was willing to cut Hamill some slack because I'd bought into his characters and wanted to see justice served.<br />This one has something for everybody--a bittersweet coming of age tale, a humanist message, an evocative glance back at Brooklyn in the 40's and Europe in the 30's, a hefty chunk of Judaica and a little bit of dark fantasy--it's a real crowd pleaser.<br />GRADE: Acause I'd bought into his characters and wanted to see justice served. <br />This one has something for everybody--a bittersweet coming of age tale, a humanist message, an evocative glance back at Brooklyn in the 40's and Europe in the 30's, a hefty chunk of Judaica and a little bit of dark fantasy--it's a real crowd pleaser.    <br />GRADE: A	2000-11-25

On the assassin's body he finds a statement from the &quot;Committee for Justice for the Jewish Victims of Dombey&quot;, claiming responsibility for the execution of Brossard.  It turns out that Brossard has been a fugitive for over forty years, having participated in the murder of 14 Jews in 1944.  During that time he has been protected by sympathetic members of the Catholic Church, provided with funds, hiding places, transportation and false papers.  At one point, they even secured a presidential pardon for him, but then he was charged with a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;, against which the pardon offers no dispensation.<br />But now times have changed and many of those in the Church and in government who protected Brossard have passed on and others simply want him out of the way, lest his prosecution serve as a model for subsequent trials.  Moreover, the succeeding generation of officials does not bear any sympathy towards him, so they too are on his trail.  What follows is a thrilling chase, as Brossard is pursued by Church, State and the shadowy committee and by &quot;friend&quot; and foe alike.<br />Beyond the basic thriller premise, Moore also offers an examination of the often ignored war guilt of France.  Initially it seems possible to feel some sympathy for Brossard and the other aging collaborators, to the extent that they were motivated by anti-Communism and anti-modernism.  But as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that, at heart, they were driven as much by genuine hatred of Jews as by any other less repulsive motives.<br />Moore based Brossard on an actual person, Paul Touvier, and the story's essentials, from the assistance of the Church to the presidential pardon, are all historical, though Touvier was captured in 1989 and died in prison.  These, of course, are facts that stand in stark contrast to the myth that DeGaulle consciously chose to cultivate instead, of the French people as proud heroes of the Resistance, standing firm against the Nazi oppressor.

Often as not, their particular significance to us as individuals extends far beyond that which they would have to anyone else and sometimes, if we return to them at a different point in our own lives, it can be hard to recapture why they should have seemed so momentous in the first place.  One of the authors who really turned me into a reader was Edgar Rice Burroughs and I am ecstatic to find that his books are just as terrific in real life as they are in boyhood memories.<br />I still vividly recall the cover of Tarzan and the Ant Men, a book which I read and reread in around 5th or 6th grade.  It was one of those cheesy 50 cent paperbacks (now they would cost you at least $5.99) and it featured the Lord of the Jungle surrounded by spear wielding pygmies,  It was just so ripe with the promise of adventure that, to this day, I can not imagine a human being gazing upon its glory and not being consumed by a desire to read the book.  And once you read one, you were faced with a plethora of riches.  There are 26 Tarzan novels and myriad movies; plus there was an excellent comic book version and a Saturday morning cartoon at that point.  Then there were Burroughs's other series, my particular favorites being the Pellucidar books and John Carter, Warlord of Mars.  You could practically read nothing but Burroughs and go for years before having to start rereading stuff.  But, of course, the great thing about getting a kid hooked on reading is that one author leads to another.  Soon I was mowing down Jules Verne books (see review of Around the World in Eighty Days) and the adventures of Doc Savage, The Avenger, The Shadow, The Lone Ranger, etc., not to mention Tolkein and C.S. Lewis (see review of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe).<br />So imagine my pleasure when I found this old Ballantine Books paperback of Tarzan of the Apes, with a cover by Neal Adams showing an enraged Tarzan racing towards a screeching great ape who is grasping a seductively disheveled Jane by her flowing blonde locks.  It's amazing, you haven't read a word yet and already your pulse is racing.  Then open the book and, wonder of wonders, it's every bit as thrilling and wonderful as I remembered it.  Shipwrecks, mutinies, buried treasure, lion attacks, hostile tribesmen, and most of all the ape pack and the herculean efforts of one lost little boy to survive in the forbidding wilds of Africa--what more could a reader want in a book?<br />Tarzan is one of a small group of fictional characters--the others being Frankenstein, Dracula and Sherlock Holmes--created in the last 200 years who have acquired lives of their own, far outlasting their creators to be constantly reprised and reimagined.  If we examine this quartet, they are united by one central theme; each represents man's desire to in some way control nature.  Frankenstein is, of course, an expression of our aspiration towards godhood (see Orrin's review), the dream of creating life.  Dracula expresses the desire to escape death and achieve immortality.  Holmes embodies our hope that pure reason will yield the solutions to life's mysteries.  And Tarzan, in all his Darwinian glory, is an assertion of the inevitability that it would be man who rose to the top of the evolutionary totem pole.  Each, thus, strikes a chord deep in our being.  But what makes them transcendent and fascinating, generation after generation, is the element of uncertainty that each contains.  Frankenstein is obviously an experiment run amok.  Dracula's immortality comes at an unbearable price.  Holmes's hyper-rational mind requires the stimulation of drugs to battle boredom.  And Tarzan is trapped uneasily between the civilized and the savage worlds.  In this context he implicates two issues, one obvious--man's control over nature, the other less so--the effect of civilization on mankind.<br />As to the first issue, I was pleasantly surprised at the recent Disney version of Tarzan.  In light of films like Pocahontas and Lion King, I just expected it to be politically correct pabulum.  That implicit message of Tarzan--that man naturally and rightfully rules nature, disposing of its bounty at his will--is so anathema to the environmentalist hegemony of our times that you sort of had to assume that Disney would eviscerate the story.  They did alter it substantially, particularly by not having Tarzan fight Kerchak to become leader of the ape pack, but they left enough of the basic tale intact to satisfy all but the most fanatic ERBites.  And, at the end of the day, you can argue about the propriety of man controlling the environment and exploiting nature, but it is pretty hard to argue against the power of Burrough's metaphorical image of the youthful human Tarzan becoming the Lord of the Jungle.  Simply taken as a cultural symbol, Tarzan is fascinating, a modern myth comparable to any ancient one.<br />On the second issue, Tarzan's unique upbringing and his very role as the hero of these books along with the helplessness displayed by &quot;civilized&quot; whites when they enter the jungle, raises the question of whether civilization is simply a veneer which we could drop if necessary (as London implies in Call of the Wild [see review] and The Sea Wolf [see review]) or whether civilization strips away something primal and valuable in our natures.  In a famous essay on the Tarzan books, Gore Vidal asserts that:<br />  a good many people find their lives so unsatisfactory that they go right on year after year telling  themselves stories in which they are able to dominate their environment in a way that is not possible  in this overorganized society<br />His snitty point is about domination and what losers the readers of these books must be (of course, he more than likely spent his closeted youth reading Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and look how he turned out), but it is the &quot;overorganized society&quot; part of this comment that is the most interesting, obliquely pointing out the subtext of the weakening influence of modern society on mankind.  If we accept Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest--which we will for the sake of this discussion--then what happens when the threats to our survival are removed, or at the very least reduced?  Tarzan suggests the possibility that the pressures of the fight for survival forge a stronger man than the advances of modern civilization can hope to compete with.<br />It is with this perspective that we can perceive the irony that Tarzan--the son of an English Lord, raised in Africa--is the quintessential American hero.  Embodying the elements of rugged individualism and self-reliance, he is an archetype in the tradition of Natty Bumpo.  It is no surprise then that this series of books is probably the most successful and popular in all of American Literature.<br />But enough analysis.  The important thing about these books is that they are genuinely exciting and are enormous fun to read.<br />GRADE: A+recent Disney version of Tarzan.

You see, I made the mistake of reading this book just before finals &amp; immediately followed it up by reading everything about or by Sir Richard Francis Burton that I could find.<br />The central conceit of Farmer's Hugo Award Winner is that everyone who ever lived on Earth is resurrected along the banks of a river on a mysterious world.  One of the first people to understand their predicament and take action is the linguist, explorer, translator Sir Richard Francis Burton.  Along with Alice Hargreaves (of Alice in Wonderland fame), a Neanderthal named Kazz , an alien from Tau Centauri named Monat Grrautut (who precipitated the Apocalypse that destroyed Earth in 2008) and others found along the way, Burton sets off upriver to try to figure out why they've been brought to this place.  But when they figure out that The River may be 20 million miles long and then they are captured by Herman Goring and a band of Ancient Romans, things get even more complicated.<br />Farmer has a wonderful idea here &amp; he plays it to the hilt, dropping in interesting historical characters &amp; playing off cultures and ethnicity's against each other.  I especially like the way he's taken his characters to the promised afterlife &amp; instead of finding answers to the question of existence, they find that it's just as confounding as life on Earth.<br />But the great revelation here is Burton.  If you've never heard of him, you'll want to read more &amp; if you're familiar with him, you'll want to read about him anew.<br />GRADE: B	2000-11-25

He hunts down and &quot;retires&quot; rogue androids (andys).  Thanks to technology from companies like the Rosen Association, it's getting increasingly hard to tell the androids from the humans, but there is an empathy test that Deckard can administer; androids don't feel empathy for humans or for each other.  Meanwhile, due to the devastation wreaked by nuclear fallout from World War Terminus, animal life is nearly sacred and pets are status symbols.  Deckard and his wife have an electric sheep just to try and keep up with the Joneses.  Also, the fallout is starting to impact the genetics and fertility of humans, so the government is advocating emigration to Mars, running a Public Service Ad that warns:  &quot;Emigrate or degenerate!  The choice is yours!&quot;  Amidst all of this, a new religion has arisen called Mercerism.  It's founder, Wilber Mercer, is an empath who is taking all of mankind's suffering upon his own shoulders.  Adherents transmit their pain to him through Mercer Boxes and receive inner peace in return.  Now Deckard has been given the assignment of retiring a gang of 8 andys and, to his own horror, he finds that he is starting to develop feelings of empathy for these humanoids while Mercer is telling him that it's wrong to kill the androids, but that he has to go ahead and do it anyway.<br />This is my favorite of Philip K. Dick's novels.  It deals imaginatively with the big themes that are central to speculative fiction, especially what is it that makes us human.  And, unlike some of his other books, he maintains the momentum of the basic story line throughout and keeps everything reasonably coherent.<br />GRADE: B+	2000-11-25

After meager initial sales, the poems were passed around by such figures as Richard Burton, Dante Gabriel Rosetti, Robert Browning, William Morris &amp; Swinburne and the praise from these men lead to it's becoming a bestseller.<br />FitzGerald, was born on March 31, 1809 in Suffolk.  He married unhappily  and escaped from his marriage by devoting himself to translating Omar Kayyam's poetry.  Kayyam was a Persian mathematician and astronomer, born in Persia on May 18, 1048.  The rubaiyat are sort of like haiku in that they were not really the product of poets, they were mostly written by Persian intellectuals..  They are two line stanzas, split in two again.  The first, second and last lines rhyme; the third is unrhymed. FitzGerald was captivated by Kayyam's work, but in translating them, he made them very much his own, rather than slavishly reproducing them word for word:<br />  VII<br />  25  Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring  26  The Winter Garment of Repentance fling:  27  The Bird of Time has but a little way  28  To fly--and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing.<br />  XI<br />  41  Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,  42  A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse--and Thou  43  Beside me singing in the Wilderness--  44  And Wilderness is Paradise enow.<br />  XXIII<br />  89  Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,  90  Before we too into the Dust descend;  91  Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie,  92  Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and--sans End!<br />  XXVI<br />  101 Oh, come with old Khayy&aacute;m, and leave the Wise  102 To talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies;  103  One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies;  104 The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.<br />  XXXIV<br />  133 Then to this earthen Bowl did I adjourn  134 My Lip the secret Well of Life to learn:  135  And Lip to Lip it murmur'd--&quot;While you live  136 Drink!--for once dead you never shall return.&quot;<br />  XXXVII<br />  145 Ah, fill the Cup:--what boots it to repeat  146 How Time is slipping underneath our Feet:  147  Unborn TO-MORROW, and dead YESTERDAY,<br />  148 Why fret about them if TO-DAY be sweet!<br />  XXXIX<br />  153 How long, how long, in infinite Pursuit  154 Of This and That endeavour and dispute?  155  Better be merry with the fruitful Grape  156 Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.<br />  XLIX<br />  193 'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days  194 Where Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:  195  Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,  196 And one by one back in the Closet lays.<br />  LI<br />  201 The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,  202 Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit  203  Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,  204 Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.<br />These resulting poems reflect the atheism of the two men and are pretty much nihilist, existential and decadent.

Two books in one!<br />The primary function of this book is as a brilliant defense of Judge Bork's philosophy of original understanding and an excoriating polemic against judicial intervention.  Surveying the entire history of American jurisprudence, Bork takes on interventionists of the Left and of the Right and makes an irrefutable case for the proposition that judicial intervention is a threat to the very functioning of the Republic.  As you read his arguments and watch him marshal the facts, it's easy to understand why his nomination to the Supreme Court became such a political crucible.  We lost the opportunity to have a really first class mind shape the Court for a generation when he was defeated.<br />That entire ugly confirmation fight makes up a kind of book within the book.  It is excruciatingly painful to read this section, as genuine ... like Ted Kennedy and Howard Metzenbaum and Joe Biden sit in judgment on Bork in the Judiciary Committee hearings.  I can understand why the Left thought it was so important to keep him off of the bench, but the lengths they went to, including lies, character assassination and invasion of privacy, are really sickening and continue to reverberate through our politics today, to noone's benefit.<br />This is an important book by a decent man who was done wrong.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-11-22

There are actually at least three books lurking between the covers of American Nomad.  First, there is the extremely funny tale of how he came to write the book, which initially started out as an assignment for Rolling Stone. Second, there are extended riffs on topics that range from the novels of Philip K. Dick, to Olivers Stone's movies, to Bruce Springsteen and Frank Sinatra, to a long bizarre comparison of Richard Nixon and the Mike Hammer of Kiss Me Deadly.  Finally, there is the aforementioned discussion of the state of the Nation circa 1996, a time when we had come to almost casually accept such previously unthinkable events and conditions as the OJ verdict, abortion clinic bombings, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Olympic Park bombing, the repeated Unabomber attacks, a divided government led by the morally bankrupt Bill Clinton on one side and the equally corrupt Newt Gingrich on the other, and the approach of the millennium--all of them seeming to somehow indicate a country so deeply divided that the various sides were actually willing to go to war with one another.  In Erickson's eyes these are all potential signs of the apocalyptic collapse of democracy.<br />The story of his work for Rolling Stone is a genuine hoot.  The Californian Erickson, a successful young author in the Thomas Pynchon mold, was originally hired because, as the features editor told him, &quot;What we want is a novelist who will write about the 1996 presidential campaign as though it were a novel.&quot;  But even in his first meetings with the magazine's editor, Jann Wenner, he realized that he was expected to compete with the New York Times, despite the fact that he was not a professional reporter.  The collision of his own and Wenner's expectations led to a series of amusing misunderstandings and confrontations over the ensuing months, with the author covering the interesting fringes of the Republican race and the fascinating but doomed candidates, while the magazine pushed for strategy, tactics, scoops and straightforward coverage of the Dole campaign.  Erickson's account of these battles basically adds up to a drive by shooting in which his target is Wenner and the publisher's grandiose pretensions and limited understanding of politics.  Meanwhile, Erickson had really vested himself in the story and when he was finally fired, simply decided:<br />  ...I would just go right on covering the campaign.  I would get in my car with my bogus press  badge and my bogus business cards and I would start driving, a bogus correspondent without  portfolio, and I would write the story of the campaign the way I had wanted to in the  beginning, and the way I had foolishly supposed in the beginning that I was being hired to do,  but now armed with moonshine credentials and a surreptitious itinerary of my own making.  And I would keep on driving out past L.A. and back into America and into the last years of  the Twentieth Century, on one last rampage through the national asylum just to make one last  observation, one last comment, or even to tell just one last lie, just as long as no one expected  from me one last answer.<br />So, unemployed, uncredentialed, his marriage seemingly crumbling, Erickson continued along his own gonzo path.<br />Freed from the constraints and delusions of the Rolling Stone editors, Erickson liberally sprinkles this book with long digressive expositions on popular culture.  Often they are really interesting and insightful, like the ones on Springsteen and Oliver Stone.  Sometimes they are just as bewildering as they are fascinating, like imagining Richard Nixon as Mike Hammer.  And sometimes they simply don't work at all, like an imagined world where the hostage rescue worked and Jimmy Carter won a second term.  But, on balance, they do enliven the book and add more than they detract.<br />The real core of the book though is Erickson's attempt to understand what was happening in America at that moment, how the country had become so divided, with minorities--racial, religious, political, or whatever--questioning not just the ideas but the very legitimacy of their opponents.  He correctly identifies, but I think fails to understand, the fundamental schizophrenia that had beset the American people : the sort of self-loathing that leads the electorate to demand the truth from candidates and then punish them when they give it (a la Bob Dole in '88 or Tsongas in '92); that takes a hostile view of all special interest groups, except for those that each of us belong to; that rages against duplicitous politicians--like Clinton--then turns around and elects them.  Here Erickson's strongly stated but weakly held liberal viewpoint betrays him somewhat.  He is unable to dot the final 'i' and cross the final 't'.  The problem with modern America is that we continue to believe in our Founding myths--rugged individualism, self-reliance, democracy, freedom, etc.--but have become a country of dependents, relying on government programs that range from farm subsidies to welfare to school loans to social security.  The dissonance that Erickson correctly perceives arises from the battle between American ideals and desires.  Thus in a moment of almost insane idealism the electorate chose a Republican Congress in 1994, hell bent on reducing government.  But as soon as Democrats demagogued a few middle class entitlement cuts, that some electorate turned on Congress with a vengeance and embraced Bill Clinton, defender of the welfare state.  It is not that our original ideals are somehow bankrupt, as Erickson intimates, but rather that they have been temporarily (one hopes) swamped by selfishness and greed.

For instance, he does little to hide his contempt for Bill Clinton. He finds partial birth abortion repellent.  He writes compellingly about the debasing of American culture and about the hypocrisy of a generation that maintained that Rock and Roll would change the world, now arguing that pop culture has no effect on kids' moral development.  He provides wonderful portraits of the men he met whose intellectual honesty and whose true convictions impressed him--Alan Keyes, Pat Buchanan and Gary Bauer.  All of this seems to reflect a man who is much more ambivalent about his own professed liberalism than even he realizes.<br />At one point, Bauer says that he'd even vote for Erickson over Clinton and the author hastens to assures him that would be a mistake, as if he would make Clinton look like a conservative.

The authors provide enough documentation and their scenario makes sufficient sense, that I, for one, am willing to believe that there is a substantial element of truth here.  If nothing else, the reader will look at the Woodward/Bernstein version of Watergate with a much more jaundiced eye and will view Dean with the contempt he so richly deserves.<br />But, after all is said and done, Richard Nixon was still our worst president ever.  Having decided to get out of Vietnam, he inexcusably dragged the war out for several more years.  Detente with the Russians nearly lost the Cold War for us and his expansion of the Social Welfare State nearly bankrupted us and was a betrayal of Republican principles.  Regardless of his level of personal involvement in the events surrounding Watergate, he created and tolerated an atmosphere of lawless paranoia in the White House, which virtually guaranteed that such incidents would occur.  And the White House tapes reveal a man whose temperament was ill-suited to being the leader of the Western world--his easy anti-Semitism and contempt for virtually everyone had no place in the Oval Office.  That he might have been victimized by disloyal staffers does not excuse his abysmal performance as President, nor his flagrant disregard for the civil liberties of his enemies, supposed or real.<br />This book is an enjoyably iconoclastic challenge to the received wisdom about Watergate, but even if every word in it is true, none of it matters that much; the coup was a good thing.<br />GRADE: C+	2000-11-22

Apparently, he was a pretty standard issue left wing intellectual.  But modern American life gnawed away at him until he wrote this brief, cogent attack on the mindless egalitarianism that he saw destroying the nation.  In a nutshell:  elitism assumes equality of opportunity and then places emphasis on excellence and success while egalitarianism, instead,  emphasizes equality of results--success is no longer a good thing and excellence is suspect.  The egalitarian assumes that differences in performance are the result of insidious discriminatory factors rather than an inevitable outcome dictated by natural talents and tries to both handicap those who perform well and coddle those who perform poorly.<br />Harris does a creditable job of surveying the popular culture to marshall facts for his argument.  The sheer weight of the data he offers on topics like affirmative action, Afrocentrism, Women's studies, social promotion, etc., makes a pretty irrefutable case that America's cultural elites have ceased to be elitist and have abandoned themselves to a set of political standards based not on quality, but on a system of political entitlements.  Now, this is hardly a new argument.  Indeed it was one of Alexis de Tocqueville's chief concerns; that a nation that was so obsessed with equality would eventually abandon the idea of equality of opportunity in favor of the demand for equality of results.  No, it's not the novelty of the argument that makes this book noteworthy.  What makes the book fascinating is the hilarious psychodrama which unfolds as Mr. Henry adopts this conservative argument, while trying to justify himself to his liberal cohort.<br />Before he really gets going, Mr. Henry offers us his Left bona fides:<br />  I am fully aware that much of what I deplore as retrograde tribalism or wrongheaded moralism is  regarded by large sectors of the population as progress.  I am also painfully conscious that taking  the postures I do may condemn me to accommodating some pretty strange bedfellows--racists,  male supremacists, patriotic zealots, reactionaries, religious exotics, and assorted other creeps.  I  confess to being a white Ivy-educated male who is married and lives in the suburbs (in kind of a  nice house, actually.)  Yet I am not a right-winger, and I hope I am not a nut.  I am still a registered  Democrat, a recipient of awards for civil rights writing from the National Conference of Christians  and Jews, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and the Unity in Media contest based at  historically black Lincoln University.  I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU and a donor to  abundant left-of-center social causes.  My boyhood heroes were Hubert Humphrey and Martin  Luther King, Jr.  At a party in Washington some months ago I hurriedly crossed the room to avoid  even being introduced to Pat Buchanan, and my wife and I have donated copiously to the electoral  opponents of Jesse Helms.<br />No, seriously.  I didn't make this up.  I know it reads like some kind of Stalinist Show Trial self-denunciation or cocktail banter from a Tom Wolfe character, but the guy actually wrote all that.  And as the book goes along, we're treated to all kinds of tidbits about his black or gay friends and his deep sensitivities for the unfortunate, usually just before he sticks the shiv in some representative of a minority group.  It's a hoot.<br />But the end result is that, contrary to the title, while he presents a devastating attack on egalitarianism, he lacks the courage of his convictions and does not honestly defend the elitist values that he espouses.  He backs away from the logic of his own arguments and refuses to explore why the Elite Culture of which he is so fond is fundamentally a product of white Christian straight men.  He ignores the fact that the rise of egalitarianismand the pace of the attack on elitism have quickened in the seven or eight decades when the franchise and political power have been rapidly expanded to the very people whose work product he suggests does not measure up to traditional elite standards of excellence.  Watching the virtual self-hypnosis that he had to go through just to go out as far on a conservative limb as he did, it is no wonder that he could drag himself no further.  No wonder, but it is too bad.<br />Mr. Henry died shortly after the publication of this book, so we'll never know whether he eventually would have been able to face the full import of his own argument.  Instead, he leaves behind a very entertaining, though ultimately incomplete, polemic against the sorry state of American culture.<br />GRADE: B-.

In fact, this aspect of Jefferson's character is easily explained, though his alleged relationship with Sally Hemmings is more problematic.  The truly difficult aspect of his character is his profoundly antidemocratic lack of respect for the Constitution.<br />It really isn't hard to understand the Founders' willingness to tolerate slavery.  It is merely necessary to jettison the 20th Century (&amp; 19th for that matter) detritus that clutters our minds when we look back at them through the mists of time.  Whenever we watch a movie set in pre-Modern times, my wife will turn to me and say the same thing every time, &quot;Boy those people must have really smelled.&quot;  But do we think of Jefferson as crude because he took a bath once a month or whatever?  No, because this was the convention of the time.  Similarly, it is asinine to try to judge his opinion of Blacks by a modern standard.<br />Western man found African Blacks living in near Stone Age conditions.  This, combined with physical dissimilarities lead to the understandable, though unfortunate, belief that Blacks were somehow lesser humans.  To look back from the end of the Twentieth Century and take 18th Century men to task for this is both unfair and unproductive.  In judging Jefferson, it should suffice that the Declaration that he wrote, in particular the phrase: &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, made the end of slavery inevitable.<br />[A Thought Experiment: Suppose for a moment that we project current demographics and politics forward in time a couple decades.  Women have become increasingly powerful politically and as a result many more protections have been put in for the weakest members of society.  Abortion, Euthanasia and Animal Experimentation are all illegal.  The people of this time could look back on us and write books about the impossibility of reconciling Bill Clinton's rhetoric with his support for all three.  Surely we can see that this would be unfair.]<br />On the other hand, the possibility of a Jefferson/Hemmings liaison is a more troubling issue.  If he truly felt, as his slave ownership indicates he must have, that blacks were inferior and whites were entitled to own them, then he would be little more than a sexual predator if he initiated a physical relationship with her.  She was already unable to give true consent because of the master/slave relationship, but Jefferson should have perceived her as even less able to consent if he believed her to be a member of a lesser species.  I am not willing to assume that he did enter into such a relationship, it remains unproved, but if it ever is proven, it will force a major reconsideration of his character, or lack of such.<br />The criticism of Jefferson's attitude towards Blacks actually misses the the most fundamental trouble spot in his character.  It is his overly idealistic attitude towards democracy and his lack of respect for the law that really raises questions.  Ellis does an excellent job of demonstrating that individual freedom and antipathy towards all institutions were the defining characteristics of Jefferson's politics.  But in order for men to enjoy freedom, they have to be able to depend on the fair and consistent functioning of the laws and the system of justice.  Ellis reveals numerous examples, from the Louisiana Purchase to his opposition to judicial review, of Jefferson's willingness to ignore the Constitution and resort to the arbitrary exercise of power.  Moreover, his support for the majority, unfettered by the protection of minority views that Madison insisted on, coupled with his approval of the French Revolution, forces us to consider whether he even understood the importance of securing political rights in a web of laws.  Ultimately he comes across as a kind of coercive utopian, willing to see the rights of the few trampled under foot in order to achieve his personal vision of the ideal agrarian democracy.  It is a short step from this Jefferson to Robespierre and The Terror or Pol Pot and The Killing Fields.<br />This excellent book raises all these issues, dealing with some better than others.  But it is always interesting and is extremely well written.<br />GRADE: A-nsisted on, coupled with his approval of the French Revolution, forces us to consider whether he even understood the importance of securing political rights in a web of laws.

2201818:US	52173832	R2TOF29G0D5KK5	0394555082	642527170	Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan	Books	3	89	106	N	N	great novel, bad bio	Fittingly, I feel compelled to interject a story from my own life as I begin this review.  You see, I believe that there is a personal episode which illuminates the controversy surrounding this book.  When I attended Colgate University (Class of '83), I was a History major, which required completion of a Senior Seminar including a major research project and paper.  But, truth be told, I was not a particularly good student and as the deadline for this paper approached, I realized that I could not possibly hope to complete the volume of research that was expected of me.  So I approached the professor, on the day the paper was due, and received tearful permission to alter my topic slightly, but this seemingly minor adjustment allowed me to essentially write an extended essay instead of a true research paper.  Freed from the requirement that I actually go through the drudgery of research, I rattled off a really good twenty page essay in a couple days.<br />It seems to me that Edmund Morris found himself in much the same position and resorted to a similarly dishonest ploy in order to complete his Reagan biography.  It is obvious that he did extensive work on Reagan's early life (say up to the end of his acting career) and, of course, he was in attendance for several years of the presidency.  But what is missing here is the context and the background for Reagan's political career, let alone a detailed account of those years.  Among the really pivotal events that go unmentioned or are dealt with in passing are all three presidential campaigns, the Panama Canal debates, the PATCO strike, the Tax Reform bill, etc.  These are not little things.  In fact, they are central to an understanding of what makes Reagan a seminal figure in recent history.  No serious biography of Ronald Reagan can conceivably be complete without tackling them.  So what happened?<br />Well, this is a really interesting illustration of my maxim that the commonly accepted wisdom is always wrong.  Edmund Morris was hired to be Reagan's semi-official biographer on the strength of his Teddy Roosevelt biography, which truly is a great book.  But there is one vital fact that noone realized at the time, and which still seems to elude critics and commentators; the book ends before it gets to the presidential years.  We all just assumed:  major political figure as topic + great book = ability (and or desire) to write a great political biography.  But there is really no evidence that Morris understands, nor is curious about, the actual mechanics of politics and the impact of political ideas.  In retrospect, it should have been seen as troubling that he was willing to set aside the Roosevelt story just as he got to what most biographers would consider the crux of the tale.<br />So we have here a terrific author, but foreign born and apparently uninterested in politics, trying to take on a man who transformed the political world.  In order to begin to understand what had happened, Morris would have had to immerse himself, not just in personal interviews and old yearbooks and the like, but in research on the Cold War on American anti-Communism on the growth of the New Deal and the Great Society on Goldwater and Bill Buckley and so on.  So he did what I did, he figured out a way to get around the heavy lifting.  All the dodges and devices that he trots out are simply there to disguise the fact that he didn't feel like learning what he needed to in order to produce a genuine political biography.  Instead, he gives us a book that is almost entirely personal.  There is one particularly revealing passage late in the book, Morris's Diary entry of December 31, 1988:<br />  For whatever reason, there was born here, far from the mattering world, an ambition as huge as it  was inexorable.  Out of Tampico's ice there grew, crystal by crystal, the glacier that is Ronald  Reagan: an ever-thrusting, ever-deepening mass of chill purpose.  Possessed of no inner warmth,  with no apparent interest save in its own growth, it directed itself toward whatever declivities lay  in its path.  Inevitably, as the glacier grew, it collected rocks before it, and used them to flatten  obstructions; when the rocks were worn smooth they rode up onto the glacier's back, briefly  enjoying high sunny views, then tumbled off to become part of the surrounding countryside.  The  lie where they fell, some cracked, some crumbled: Dutch's lateral moraine.  And the glacier sped  slowly on.<br />  In that sense, I suppose, one could say that the story of Reagan's life is a study in American  topography.  Thirteen hundred miles southeast of Tampico this winter day, the glacier has at last  stopped growing.  The nation's climate is changing; so is that of the world.  New suns, new  seasons, are due.  Yet when all the ice is gone, when fresh green covers the last raw earth and  some future skylark sings heedlessly over the Ronald Reagan National Monument, men will still  ponder Dutch's improbable progress, and write on their cards, How big he was!  How far he  came!  And how deep the valley he carved!<br />First, to give him his due, it is writing of this quality that had folks so excited about the prospect of a Ronald Reagan biography by Edmund Morris.  But, to borrow his metaphor, the essential problem with the book is that it is completely focussed on the glacier and, when you get right down to it, we don't really care as much about glaciers for their intrinsic qualities, we care about the massive change that they wreaked on the environment that we now inhabit.  Morris recognizes that Reagan changed the American topography, but he never examines that change.  For him, the remarkable thing about Ronald Reagan is that he became president.  For humankind, the remarkable thing about Reagan is that in the depths of the Cold War, when the USSR and Communism seemed to be winning and thirty years of Big Government had left America ill equipped to fight back, he imagined the West's eventual victory and the renaissance of an unfettered American economy and he imposed that dream upon an unwilling Western intellectual establishment, American Congress and seemingly ascendant Eastern Bloc.  Today we live in the world that Ronald Reagan, but precious few others, envisioned.  While Edmund Morris pursues the glacier to its end, he fails to comprehend the change left in its wake, perhaps because he fails to understand the constancy of purpose and the force of ideas which drove the glacier's progress.<br />The end result of all this is that Morris delivers up:<br />  1) An excellent novel<br />and<br />  2) The best written memoir we are ever likely to have by someone who knew Ronald Reagan<br />but<br />  3) An extraordinarily inept and inexcusably lazy biography<br />GRADE: as a novel: A; as a biography: Fno apparent interest save in its own growth, it directed itself toward whatever declivities lay      in its path.

Remini makes a compelling case that we should.<br />In addition to doing an excellent job of narrating the events of the battle, he argues that the victory  was the moment that really made America a nation.  The elements he cites include not merely the fact that it produced a future President, but also the confidence building importance of a citizen army winning a battle against the professional troops of the great British Empire, as well as the fact that this overwhelming defeat made the nations of Europe begin to take the United States seriously as a player on the world stage.  In fact, he goes beyond this to argue that New Orleans was actually the nation's first military victory, discounting actions like Saratoga and Yorktown as mere surrenders.  It is, of course,  possible that he overstates this case a little, having such a vested interest in Jackson's career.<br />On the other hand, he raises an excellent and little understood point about the War.  It was one of only three wars in our history where our existence as a nation was truly threatened (obviously the Revolution and the Civil War were the others).  We've fought all kinds of skirmishes, minor brush wars and mopping up operations--Mexican, Spanish-American, WWI, Korea, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, etc.  And we like to kid ourselves about the threat that the Nazis posed in WWII, though by the time we got in, they were already toast.  But really there were only the three conflicts where the United States as we understand it could have perished.  If we understood that fact better, perhaps we would pay more heed to the events of 1812-1815.  As is, Remini has done his part to capture our attention with this excellent little book.<br />GRADE: B+r existence as a nation was truly threatened (obviously the Revolution and the Civil War were the others).

Unarguably, Roosevelt sought to enlarge the national state as the principal instrument of the  security and stability that he hoped to impart to American life.<br />  ...ever after, Americans assumed that the federal government had not merely a role, but a major  responsibility in ensuring the health of the economy and the welfare of citizens.  That simple but  momentous shift in perceptions was the newest thing in all the New Deal, and the most  consequential.<br />Is it possible that the History of the 20th Century can be explained by simple reference to a change in prepositions?  That is the gist of the epiphany that struck me while watching David M. Kennedy on Booknotes (C-SPAN).  He and Brian Lamb were discussing the fact that this book is part of the Oxford History of the United States joining James McPherson's excellent one-volume history of the Civil War, Battle Cry of Freedom : The Civil War Era (1988).  Suddenly, the switch from &quot;of Freedom&quot; to &quot;Freedom from&quot;, in the respective titles, struck me as emblematic of the pivotal change of  emphases in the Modern world.  The history of America from Plymouth Rock until the Crash was essentially the story of Man's struggle for Freedom, but Freedom in a positive sense, Freedom to do things--to worship, to speak, to gather, etc.  Thus, McPherson's book details the great convulsion of the 19th Century, the Civil War and the struggle to free the slaves--a struggle to expand freedom.  But Kennedy, charting the great 20th Century convulsion,  has it exactly right, the importance of the responses to the Depression by both Hoover and Roosevelt lay in their decision to elevate a negative idea of Freedom, freedom from want, from hunger, from &quot;the vicissitudes of life&quot; above, and against, the traditional American ideal of individual Freedom.  This shift from a government aimed at protecting Freedom to one designed to provide Security is the single most important thing that happened in 20th Century America.<br />You may be surprised to see Hoover's name there, but one of Kennedy's great contributions in this book is this formal recognition by a liberal historian (joining the great conservative Paul Johnson, see Modern Times: The World from the Twenties to the Nineties) that Hoover, far from being a do-nothing antediluvian, was basically a liberal interventionist, who started us down the path that lead to the New Deal.  (Of course, the great difference here is that Kennedy concludes that this makes Hoover a more laudable figure, while Johnson lambastes him.)  In fact, Kennedy's reappraisal of Hoover's activism, coupled with the quotes above, unintentionally leaves the, I believe accurate, impression that the only achievement of the New Deal--the change in focus from government as a guarantor of individual freedom to a  provider of succor in time of want--was not even unique to the New Deal, but was instead a general response to the intractable Depression.<br />I say &quot;only achievement&quot;, because the book makes it pretty clear that the New Deal was completely ineffective, if not counterproductive,  in combating the Great Depression.  I was actually hesitant to read the book when Brian Lamb pointed out that Kennedy was one of the 400 historians who signed the inane petition opposing Clinton's impeachment.  You sort of have to assume that a signatory of that ahistorical reading of history would be too doctrinaire a liberal to write fairly.  In fact, Kennedy made clear in the interview and demonstrates amply in the book, that, while he is a fan of Roosevelt and approaches the work from this bias, he is perfectly willing to pass impartial judgment on FDR's shortcomings and failures. This is one of the real strengths of the book.  Where Doris Kearns Goodwin basically wrote a hagiography in No Ordinary Time (see Orrin's review), Kennedy, while still obviously an adherent and in basic agreement with FDR's efforts, is willing to portray the New Deal as poorly planned out, even chaotic, willing to conclude that only the coming of War ended the Depression, willing to take Roosevelt to task for his extremist campaign speeches in 1940, willing to condemn his Court Packing plan and, later on, willing to impartially portray his dishonesty in trying to get us into the War and the  irresponsibility of both his decision to run for a 4th term in light of his poor health and his lack of any consideration in choosing and preparing a successor.<br />I have only two real complaints about the book.  First, while Kennedy demonstrates great intellectual honesty in assessing FDR's failures, one result of his essential agreement with the concept of the New Deal is that he never really confronts the question of whether it was a mistake in and of itself.  Was it worthwhile to surrender our national birthright of Freedom in exchange for a mildly elevated sense of Security?  This fundamental question is not addressed.  I even thought that Kennedy presented himself with the perfect opportunity to do so.  He states that three premises underlay the entire New Deal effort to effect a new economic constitutional order: (1.) &quot;the era of economic growth had ended&quot;; (2.) &quot;the private sector, left to its own devices, would never again be capable of generating sufficient investment and employment to sustain even a 1920's level economy&quot;; (3.) the United States was an economically self-sufficient nation.  (This is precisely what I mean when I refer to the West's &quot;crisis of confidence&quot;, the failure of belief in capitalism and democracy.)  It would seem that since all three of these bulwarks of New Deal reasoning lie in tatters beneath the Reagan Revolution, that some discussion about them would be necessary, but it's not here.<br />Second, like Goodwin, and virtually every other writer for that matter, Kennedy treats FDR's battle with polio as if it had only beneficial effects.  He became more empathetic, more caring, etc..  I know it would be unpopular, but it's high time that someone addressed the issue of whether FDR's physical handicaps rendered him emotionally unsuited to lead a vital and freedom loving nation.  It strikes me that it is only political correctness that prevents us from discussing whether his world view was so changed by his crippling disease that he was incapable, at an admittedly trying time in our nation's history, to view the needs of the average American with the proper perspective.  Or whether he was so emotionally twisted by his physical needs, that he simply assumed that everyone needed the same extraordinary level of assistance.  I would argue that the Social Welfare state that he bequeathed us, by treating people like they were helpless, gave us several generations of people who grew increasingly dependent on government and gradually abandoned notions of self-help and personal responsibility.<br />These quibbles aside, I heartily recommend the book.  This huge (936 page), but eminently readable, history of America from the election of Hoover to the end of WWII should be required reading for all Americans.<br />GRADE: Ahile still obviously an adherent and in basic agreement with FDR's efforts, is willing to portray the New Deal as poorly planned out, even chaotic, willing to conclude that only the coming of War ended the Depression, willing to take Roosevelt to task for his extremist campaign speeches in 1940, willing to condemn his Court Packing plan and, later on, willing to impartially portray his dishonesty in trying to get us into the War and the  irresponsibility of both his decision to run for a 4th term in light of his poor health and his lack of any consideration in choosing and preparing a successor. <br />I have only two real complaints about the book.

Grant: Soldier & President (Modern Library Paperbacks)	Books	5	40	42	N	N	one of the very best biographies that I have ever rea	This is one of the very best biographies that I have ever read.  In addition to being written in a lyrical prose, it offers a much needed corrective to the withering, and unfair, historical portrait that Grant has been stuck with.  Let's face it, here's what most of us know about Grant:  he didn't do much at West Point, was a failure in business, drank his way through the Civil War, winning only because he was willing to kill his own soldiers, oversaw one of the most corrupt Presidential administrations ever and died.  The most important previous biography, William McFeely's Pulitzer Prizewinning Grant (1981), took a sufficiently negative view of Grant that it did little to change, and even reinforced, these received truths.  Like almost all misrepresentations in History, there are kernels of truth in the portrait, but it leaves out much and Perret is able to convincingly challenge much of the rest of it.<br />Missing from that portrayal are Grant's fundamental decency as a man, his exemplary service in the Mexican War, his genuine strategic insight and at times nearly prophetic foresight (as when he offered to have a Cabinet member put his personal wealth in a blind trust), and his authorship of perhaps the best book written by a U. S. President (only Teddy Roosevelt can really challenge for the title), one of the great books of the 19th Century, his Personal Memoirs.  Perret gives each of these the full treatment that it deserves and Grant's exceptional character and his control over his emotions and ego run like a leit motif throughout the book.<br />Perhaps more importantly, Perret takes on each of the negative characterizations that has accrued to Grant's reputation over the years.  Grant did perform indifferently at the Military Academy, but Perret points out that simply attending college (and West Point was one of the best in the world) put Grant in the educated elite of his time.  Moreover, besides being an exceptional and much envied horseman, Grant performed well in classes that interested him and went on to study military history and tactics for the rest of his life, developing a really fine analytical mind on military matters.<br />Grant did not do well in business, but he was scrupulously honest and as he first demonstrated as a quartermaster in the Mexican War, he was capable, even gifted, at managing materiel.  Later when he was running the entire Union Army, he did so professionally and even brilliantly.  It's hard to see how he can be faulted so heavily for bad luck running small businesses and given so little credit for managing what must have been one of the largest enterprises in human history up until that time.<br />Grant did drink, but there is no evidence that it ever effected the performance of his duties.  Also, he drank only when he was lonely.  Any time that his wife was in the vicinity he was a virtual teetotaler.<br />As to the manner in which he won the war, it seems increasingly possible to me that there were only three men on Earth who genuinely understood the dynamics of the Civil war as it was unfolding: Winfield Scott, Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.  Winfield Scott, as the War began, enunciated his Anaconda Plan, calling for the North to exploit its superior numbers and for Union troops to close off the Mississippi and then start squeezing the South like a rodent in the grip of a snake.  But Scott was an old man by that time and was not capable of managing the effort.  Lincoln knew that Scott was correct in his strategic vision, but it fell to him to keep the political plates spinning and to find the generals to carry out the plan.  Destiny handed him the ideal instrument in U.S. Grant who grasped the vision and had the iron will to carry it out.  If Grant was sometimes willing to suffer losses as the price of engaging the foe, he never wasted lives intentionally and was shattered by the occasions where men under his command did die futilely.<br />Finally, on the issue of the corruption in his administration, Perret makes one point that I found profound.  Grant's administration was not any more corrupt than the ones that succeeded it, but the fact that it was more corrupt than the ones that preceded it has caused it to be seen as extraordinarily scandalous.  And it was more scandal ridden, not because of anything intrinsic to Grant, but because one of the consequences of the War was that the Federal government had grown tremendously in size and there was simply more there to steal.  Similarly, the explosive growth in the size of government in the past sixty years has been accompanied by an unending series of scandals regardless of administration.<br />In the end, whether or not Perret succeeds in winning all of these battles to reclaim Grant's reputation, he definitely does get the reader to take a step back and look at Grant with a fresh perspective.  The Grant who emerges from this portrait is a genuine American hero and one of the most honorable and decent men ever to become President.  This is an outstanding book and a valuable reassessment of a seemingly ordinary man who called upon his own extraordinary will to achieve great things and shape American history.  Most highly recommended.<br />GRADE: A+orruption in his administration, Perret makes one point that I found profound.

So having recently read Dutch (see Orrin's review) and wanting to get a more positive spin on the Gipper, I figured this was as good a book as any.  But as I reread it I found something really unexpected and stupefying; to a remarkable degree Dutch appears to have been plagiarized from Peggy Noonan.  At first I thought it was just the chatty tone and Noonan's habit of imagining scenes from Reagan's life.  But then I got to the point where Noonan has a throw away line about Reagan that struck me as awfully familiar and I recalled that Morris uses it as the central metaphor towards the end of his book.  Noonan says that a Reagan aide told her that: &quot;Beneath the lava flow of warmth there is something impervious as a glacier&quot;.  As I noted in my review of the Morris book, he seizes upon this image of Reagan as a glacier, and while I think he uses it to somewhat dubious effect, what really jumped out at me was that he used it at all, and as near as I can tell it's unattributed.  Now to give him his due, he claims that in this instance he was merely reproducing his own diary entry from 1998 (Noonan's book didn't come out until 1990) and I suppose he could be the unnamed source of Noonan's quote, but by that point the similarities in the two texts were just getting to be too much for me to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br />One central theme that they agree on seems like it may be a puzzle to biographers and historians for years to come, the question of who Ronald Reagan really was.  On this point, though she has nearly a schoolgirl crush on him, Noonan is no more forgiving than Morris.  The portrait she paints, though generally positive, is of an affable but fundamentally unapproachable figure.  She conveys much the same sense as Morris, that Ronald Reagan presented a facade to the world, essentially playing the role of Ronald Reagan in a movie of his own life.  Whatever lay behind the mask was not there for public consumption; it was reserved for Nancy and himself.<br />Now Noonan and Morris, and many critics, are deeply troubled by this.  We live after all in an age where the current resident of the White House has no secret self.  His presidency has been one long (seemingly interminable) exercise in psychodrama, with himself as the patient and the rest of us as the analysts.  And for all the current fashion in singing the praises of the Greatest Generation (see Orrin's review) and their humble service to country, there is a palpable sense that we are dissatisfied with these older folks who don't bare their souls and beg us to feel their pain.  It's instructive that when push came to shove, the electorate twice chose Bill Clinton and all his Oprahesque, cathartic, stage show baggage over George Bush and Bob Dole, decent men and competent public servants who couldn't make that same bathetic connection to the voters.  It is the generation of Noonan and Morris that is essentially running the country and the culture right now and this is what they seem to want in their politicians.  But Reagan, who is actually a little older than most of the WWII generation, came from a time when such openness would have been unthinkable and as the child of an alcoholic father it is hard to imagine how he could ever lay bare his inner being in the way these folks seem to require.<br />This book is great fun, in particular for the acid sketches and loving portraits of the colorful cast of characters who surrounded the Administration.  And the Reagan who emerges from the pages is a complex and fascinating bundle of contradictions, a much richer figure than the Reagan that Morris portrays.  While Noonan was frustrated by not penetrating his veneer, the man she reveals seems to be worthy of both the hero worship and the partisan hatreds that he summoned forth.<br />Noonan herself is an emblematic representative of her times.  The casually liberal kid from Massapequa, Long Island who was so repelled by the excesses and nihilism of her generation that she was driven into the arms of the conservative movement.  But at the same time she retained her sense of perspective and a healthy skepticism.

Requiem (Elvis Cole)	Books	3	8	16	N	N	A good series in obvious decline	Before we begin, let me first say that this book got almost uniformly rave reviews from every media source I could find.  So it is entirely possible that you should dismiss what follows as the crotchety grousings of an ornery old man, but I thought the book, while peopled with likable heroes and displaying Crais's steady hand at dialogue, was a predictable, cliche-ridden, mistake.<br />Before we go any further, it would be helpfully if you peruse my review of the first book in the Elvis Cole series, The Monkey's Raincoat (Grade : B+).  As you can see, I've had reservations about the series from the beginning, indeed about the direction of the hard-boiled genre generally, and several of those concerns come to a head here.  In this eighth entry in the series, Robert Crais moves Joe Pike off of the periphery and places him near the center of the story.  When an old girlfriend is missing, Joe asks Elvis, the first favor he's ever asked, to help him find her.  The girl's wealthy Hispanic businessman father wants them to keep an eye on the police investigation because he's concerned that the cops aren't taking the matter seriously.  When the case turns into a murder investigation, the father uses his pull with Hispanic City Councilmen to get Elvis loosely attached to the official police detail, much to their resentment, which is only compounded by the fact that Joe Pike is Elvis's partner.<br />Here the Pike story moves to the forefront as Crais fills in the details of his mysterious past.  It turns out that Pike left the police force after killing his own partner in the midst of the arrest of a pedophile.  Supposedly, the partner, Abel Wozniak, was beating the suspect and Pike intervened; a shot was fired and Wozniak died, shot by his own gun.  Complicating the matter was the fact that Internal Affairs was investigating Wozniak's involvement with a burglary ring and Pike's desire, unfulfilled, for Wozniak's wife.  Unfortunately for Cole and Pike, the officer in charge of this murder investigation, Harvey Krantz, was also involved in the original Internal Affairs investigation of the shooting, during which Pike humiliated him in spectacular, near career wrecking, fashion.  He fobs Cole off on Samantha Dolan, a driven and resentful black sheep of the Robbery-Homicide team who several years before had been the inspiration for a CBS TV series.  Krantz effectively freezes Cole out of the case, refusing to share reports with him or passing him doctored ones, and Dolan is uncooperative, both because she feels slighted having to baby-sit Cole and because Krantz continually denigrates her.<br />Pike and Cole use their own ample resources and unique techniques to develop their own leads on the case and discover that the killing was similar enough to several others that Krantz and his team are secretly treating it as a serial killer case.  Not only has this information been kept from them, so has the fact that they've identified a suspect.  Then, when the suspect is gunned down, all the evidence points to Pike and Cole has to try to clear his friend and get him out of jail.<br />As Cole feeds her useful information, Dolan becomes an ally and eventually falls in love with him, much to the consternation of Cole's girlfriend, Lucy Chenier, who has just moved to LA in order to be closer to him.  Further complicating their relationship is the fact that Lucy believes Pike may have actually committed the crime and her willingness to make Cole choose between her and Pike.<br />I'll not reveal any more of the plot because if you're not a mystery reader there's some remote possibility that some of the twists will surprise you.  Let me instead discuss some of the general weaknesses with the story.  First, and foremost, is the decision to delve into Pike's background and psyche, which only serves to diminish the character.  It turns out that Pike's step-father was a brutal drunkard who terrorized and battered Joe and his Mother.  In a flashback, Pike recalls one particularly horrific beating and as he hides in the woods vows :<br />  I will make myself strong.  I will not hurt.  It won't always be this way.<br />The rest of his life, especially Marine Reconnaissance Patrol Training, is devoted to turning himself into a man who is strong enough never to be hurt physically again.  This is all presumably intended to humanize Pike, but what it does is make him seem to be little more than a response to childhood trauma, the product of a formula, and an object of pity.  The subplots about his romance with the dead girl and his chaste love for Wozniak's wife, likewise make him seem more tender and vulnerable than he has in prior books and his reliance on Cole over the course of the investigation make him seem almost emotionally dependent.  Why?  Robert B. Parker has done much the same with Hawk by now, turning him from an amoral force of nature with a bizarre loyalty to Spenser into an insipid cross between Marvin Hagler and Oprah.  Both Crais and Spenser have robbed the characters of the air of mystery which made them so interesting to begin with.  Where they once seemed like forces of nature, they are now merely slightly tougher versions of the hero of the series.  Moreover, the conventions of the genre require the p.i. to finish off the case, so the supposed tough guys end up being saved by the detectives.  None of this dilution of the characters makes any sense from a dramatic standpoint, nor are their backgrounds sufficiently interesting on their own to justify sacrificing the aura of enigma they had brought to the tales.<br />Equally annoying in this book is the off-the-shelf nature of the other characters.  Girlfriends and their children exist for nearly the sole purpose of being placed in danger, kind of like the baby in the perambulator in The Untouchables.  The bad cop is, of course, the Internal Affairs guy.  The serial killer is capable of near flawless planning and commission of a fairly complex revenge plot.  And Samantha Dolan's predicament, beautiful and tough but no one takes her seriously, may have been realistic twenty years ago, but in post-Rodney King, post-OJ Los Angeles, a famous female cop who was being treated unfairly by a white male supervisor would merely need to call the L. A. Times and she'd be the next Commissioner.  This subplot is badly outdated and fails to understand the true power relationship between the genders and the races in the modern world.<br />Finally, as a general matter, the book reflects what I think is the single worst trend in the genre, the tendency to make the stories be about the detective, instead of about the case or really about the other characters involved in the case.  We've come a long, and not very healthy, way since Dashiell Hammett didn't even bother to give the Continental Op a name (see Orrin's review of Red Harvest) and from the novels of Ross MacDonald, which were fundamentally stories about the crimes at the core of dysfunctional families.  Most of the mystery in L. A. Requiem concerns uncovering the real Joe Pike and exploring Elvis's relationship with him.  Blech!  Spare us.<br />Robert B. Parker tantalized us several times with glimpses of what the Spenser series could have achieved, in A Savage Place (read Orrin's review) when Spenser went to L.A. on a case without Susan or Hawk, and in the sequence of books during which Susan had abandoned Spenser.  Crais has reached a point where it's in the best interest of the Elvis Cole series to ditch Pike and Cole's love interests for a while, maybe send him East for a couple of cases on his own, which would perforce return the focus to case and clients.  Unfortunately, the book ends with him voicing his love for L. A. and vowing to rebuild his relationship with Lucy.  One fears a slow decline into Hart to Hart and heart-to-heart territory.<br />GRADE : Ce recalls one particularly horrific beating and as he hides in the woods vows : <br />    I will make myself strong.

This subplot is badly outdated and fails to understand the true power relationship between the genders and the races in the modern world. <br />Finally, as a general matter, the book reflects what I think is the single worst trend in the genre, the tendency to make the stories be about the detective, instead of about the case or really about the other characters involved in the case.  We've come a long, and not very healthy, way since Dashiell Hammett didn't even bother to give the Continental Op a name (see Orrin's review of Red Harvest) and from the novels of Ross MacDonald, which were fundamentally stories about the crimes at the core of dysfunctional families.  Most of the mystery in L. A. Requiem concerns uncovering the real Joe Pike and exploring Elvis's relationship with him.  Blech!  Spare us. <br />Robert B. Parker tantalized us several times with glimpses of what the Spenser series could have achieved, in A Savage Place (read Orrin's review) when Spenser went to L.A. on a case without Susan or Hawk, and in the sequence of books during which Susan had abandoned Spenser.  Crais has reached a point where it's in the best interest of the Elvis Cole series to ditch Pike and Cole's love interests for a while, maybe send him East for a couple of cases on his own, which would perforce return the focus to case and clients.  Unfortunately, the book ends with him voicing his love for L. A. and vowing to rebuild his relationship with Lucy.  One fears a slow decline into Hart to Hart and heart-to-heart territory. <br />GRADE : C	2000-11-22

Crais taught the class how to structure a book by dissecting Robert Parker's first Spenser mystery, The Godwulf Manuscript (see Orrin's review of A Savage Place).  Phillips eventually found a way to incorporate his own liberal social beliefs, the elements of the classic hard-boiled private eye genre and the backdrop of post-riot Los Angeles into his first Ivan Monk mystery, Violent Spring.  Then he and John Shannon (see review of Concrete River) put together their own publishing outfit and printed the book.  As a result of their success, the Monk books have been reprinted by Berkley and are now readily available.<br />There has always been a weird dichotomy in detective fiction.  The private eye is in a certain sense something of a bleeding heart--trying to protect innocents from the corrupt system, trying to heal the pain of their clients, often protecting wrongdoers whom they feel should not be punished, and so on.  But on the other hand, they are fundamentally conservative--adhering to rigid moral codes, fighting evil, completely alienated from bureaucracy and government in general.  So there is nothing really new in what Phillips is trying to do here.<br />Ivan Monk is a former Merchant Marine, former bail bondsman, now absentee owner of a donut shop and full time private eye.  When the body of a Korean merchant is found at the groundbreaking for a new business development in South LA, both the Korean Merchants association and the white developers hire Monk to look into the murder.  It is assumed that Monk, because he is black, will be able to investigate the seeming gang related nature of the killing without ruffling feathers in the Hood.  But Monk finds himself ensnared in a vicious web of politics and ends up caught in the middle of a turf battle between black street gangs, white developers, Asian merchants and Latino community activists.  As Phillips says, modern LA most resembles the Balkans, with the different ethnic groups all struggling for their piece of the pie and mostly willing to do whatever they have to do in order to get it.<br />Phillips does try to inject some liberal cant into his tale, but it is mostly too formulaic or downright ridiculous to take seriously:<br />  Not that Monk laid the entire blame for gangsterism at the feet of men like Reagan and Bush.  Still,  he had to admit that they had set a fine example as the biggest gangbangers of all with their violent  escapades in Grenada, Libya, Panama and Iraq--all while the cities went to hell and the young folk  emulated their elders.<br />Uh huh, I can see the though process of that young hoodlum now: &quot;I was going to finish high school and get a job at Go-Go Mart while I went to Community College, but now that we've bombed Qaddafi, I'm going to deal crack instead.&quot;  You betcha.<br />But if you can gnaw your way through these brief servings of tripe, he does serve up an action packed mystery set in a milieu that is unfamiliar, fascinating and frightening.

Beschloss  1955-)<br />  The major conclusion I came to was that it is probable both Eisenhower and Khrushchev wanted a  period of at least limited d&eacute;tente. Because of their own miscalculations about each other's behavior,  that moment was lost.  -Michael Beschloss<br />In the Spring of 1960, as President Eisenhower neared the end of his successful but uneventful presidency, he devoutly wished to cap off his career with a successful summit with the Soviet Union.  Having met with Khrushchev the previous year and established the &quot;Spirit of Camp David&quot;, he envisioned forging a sort of d&eacute;tente and entering into some kind of arms treaty, perhaps a test ban, at a May meeting with the Soviet Premier in Paris.  But on May 1, 1960--celebrated as May Day in Europe and a holiday of great import in the Soviet Union--American pilot Francis Gary Powers and his U-2 spy plane were shot down over Russian territory.  The plane, on it's way from Peshawar, Pakistan to Bodo, Norway, would have been flying at an altitude of about 70,000 feet.  Russian SAMs had been steadily improving their range, and the danger of a shootdown was well understood at the highest levels of American government, in fact the President had ordered that he be given the right of final approval for each flight, but in that pre satellite era the spy planes were providing nearly all U.S. intelligence on the state of Russia's military, so Ike concluded that were worth the very high risk.  Moreover, the flights were done under CIA command, not the military, pilots had orders to commit suicide if shot down and neither they nor identifiable portions of the planes were expected to survive anyway, so the U.S. expected to maintain deniability.  The Eisenhower Administration did in fact initially deny that the U-2 was a spy plane, claiming it was a weather flight that blew off course.  In the event, Powers survived and Khrushchev, struggling to hold off &quot;hard-liners&quot; at home, chose to inflate the incident into a major provocation and, although the two sides went ahead with the Paris summit, it quickly degenerated into a diplomatic mess and the opportunity for a reduction in Cold War tensions was lost for a generation.<br />Michael Beschloss, who is a national treasure as regards study of the presidency, has done a masterful job of reconstructing the events surrounding the U-2 Affair.  He really brings the period and it's tensions to life, particularly the internal functioning of the Eisenhower administration.  To me, the most significant aspect of the book is Beschloss's argument that it was thanks to the spying of the U-2 that Eisenhower understood how weak the Soviets actually were and that Ike and Khrushchev basically had an implicit understanding that if the Soviet did not make a real effort to upgrade their sorry military capacity, the U.S. would act as if the Soviets posed a threat.  This allowed Ike to reign in the Military-Industrial Complex and balance the Federal budget, while at the same time permitting Khrushchev to swagger around the world stage as if the Soviets were our military equals.  True or not, this portrait comports with the image which has emerged in recent years of Eisenhower as a much more deft and nuanced leader than was previously understood to be the case.<br />Since this book was written before the fall of the Soviet Union, it is likely that someone taking a fresh look at the affair, particularly someone with access to Soviet archives, will have much detail to add to the Russian side of the story.  But it is hard to imagine someone producing any more readable an account of the whole incident.  If I have one reservation with the book, it is that Beschloss does not consider the broader question of whether detente was a good idea in and of itself.  Few would any longer argue that the final demise of the Evil Empire came only after they had stretched themselves to the limit.  A fuller discussion of what detente might have meant for the internal situation in Russia would have been helpful.  I'd be interested to know whether Beschloss thinks it would have weakened Communist control, which I doubt, or enabled them to devote more resources to productive domestic industries and thereby strenthened the regime's long term prospects.<br />At any rate, it's an excellent book and a really fascinating look at the Eisenhower presidency.  This one is most recommended.  Unfortunately, it's also out of print, so by all means take advantage of the out of print service above or try your your library, but it's worth tracking down.<br />GRADE: Aes to the limit.

But this book joins David McCullough's Truman, Arthur Schlesinger's A Thousand Days and Robert Dallek's LBJ biography to complete the set of hagiographies of the pre-Carter Democrat Presidents.  It is an extremely lightweight, but very readable account of the Roosevelts during the War years.  It is ideal for anyone who wants a glossy portrait of the topic and does not want to have any of their vacuous preconceptions called into question.<br />As the book opens, in May 1940, we are presented with the truly bizarre menagerie that was the Roosevelt White House.  Franklin and Eleanor have separate bedrooms--and have been estranged since Eleanor found out about his affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918.  Missy LeHand, FDR's &quot;secretary &amp; hostess&quot;, lives on the third floor.  Lorena Hickcock, Eleanor's &quot;special friend&quot; lives in the bedroom across the hall from the first lady.  Sara Roosevelt, FDR's mother, is frequently on hand, as are Harry Hopkins (FDR's friend &amp; Eleanor's ally), Joe Lash (the young left-winger &amp; future biographer whom Eleanor loves), Princess Martha of Norway (who FDR shares intimate moments with), and on and on...  But Goodwin assures us that all of these relationships are perfectly straightforward and innocent.<br />Goodwin briefly describes FDR's childhood.  She trots out the well worn story of his domineering mother, his blackballing by the Porcellian Club at Harvard, etc. All of which leave him with an &quot;anxiety to please&quot;.  However, she never really connects the dots &amp; explores how this trait (a weakness/strength that he shares with Reagan and Clinton), and it's resulting tendency to dither over decisions, lead him to needlessly hurt &amp; confuse people.  Instead the chaos that attended his governing style and his personal relationships is presented as a kind of intentional creative force.<br />Of course, FDR's paralysis from polio is presented as the formative experience in his life.  It is hard to imagine that it would not shape his character somehow, but did it have a beneficial effect?  She accepts Eleanors statement that, &quot;Anyone who has gone through great suffering is bound to have a greater  sympathy and understanding of the problems of mankind.&quot;  This is balderdash.  They're likely to understand the suffering of others who are crippled.  But the great mass of mankind is not handicapped and if his polio led FDR to govern as if all men are dependents, this is something that needs to be examined and dealt with.  Instead we are assured that FDR had a special understanding, that you and  I don't have, because of his disease.<br />In the nation meanwhile, eight years of the New Deal has still left the country with a 17% unemployment rate.  But Goodwin assures us that the New Deal has been a resounding success.  And now a second crisis (the War) approaches which is even more fearful than the first (the Depression).  What can she possibly mean by this?  In what sense was World War II, especially in it's early stages, a  dire crisis for America?  We were never seriously threatened.  There was never a chance of the Nazis winning &amp; holding power in Europe.  What crisis?<br />Suppose it was a crisis, why did it take FDR two years to get us into the War? (Even then, only the bombing of Pearl Harbor made it possible.)  If FDR was a great leader, why were these leadership skills not evident prior to December 7, 1941.<br />At any rate, War in Europe rages.  FDR faces a decision that fairly few President's ever faced.  Should he run for a third term.  Now George Washington was one of the few who could actually have won a third term, but he considered it more important that the Nation be governed by laws and not men, so he stepped down.  Following his example, no other President had stood for a third election.  But Goodwin barely acknowledges the fact that FDR's decision to run was a significant step on the way to the Imperial Presidency which finally came a cropper under JFK, LBJ &amp; Nixon.<br />Later, when FDR actually runs &amp; wins a fourth term, she not only ignores this issue, she ignores the fact that he was a dying man, with little chance of finishing his term.  It was an act of extraordinary irresponsibility to put the country in a position where it would be governed by a virtual unknown in time of war.  But by this time, as one observer remarked &quot;...he had ceased to be a person; he was simply the president.  If something was good for him, it was good; if it had no function for him as president, it didn't exist.&quot;<br />Here are a few other issues that warrant fuller treatment:<br />  1) Did the internment of the Japanese flow from something within FDR?  He often used hateful  language in describing those, like the America Firsters, who disagreed with him.  Was he prone to  seeing the Japanese as enemies, because it was easy for him to imagine enemies?<br />  2) What was the point of taking Europe away from the Nazis and giving it to the Soviets?  Was that  his intent?<br />  3)  When the war ended US debt was 127% of GNP.  If our current debt of maybe 60% is so  awful, as I'm sure she argued during the Reagan years, then how could he have saddled us with  twice that amount?<br />  4)  FDR used the Greer incident to justify convoying British ships.  He claimed that a U-boat fired  on the US ship Greer without provocation.  This was a lie and as Goodwin points out, it bore bitter  fruit in the Tonkin Gulf.  But isn't such deceitfulness an integral part of FDR's career?  He cheated  on Eleanor (understandably perhaps, since she once told a daughter that sex was &quot;an ordeal to be  borne&quot;), lied about his marriage, lied about his physical condition, etc. Wasn't lying his modus  operandi?<br />Goodwin answers none of these questions, &amp; for the most part doesn't raise them, because it's probably  never occurred to her to ask them.  She began work on this book believing the Roosevelts were demi-gods, but found she'd underestimated them.<br />As a general proposition, I'd recommend the book for those of limited intellectual curiosity.<br />GRADE: C+a significant step on the way to the Imperial Presidency which finally came a cropper under JFK, LBJ &amp; Nixon. <br />Later, when FDR actually runs &amp; wins a fourth term, she not only ignores this issue, she ignores the fact that he was a dying man, with little chance of finishing his term.

Someone must be overhearing the conversation that Wolfe so brilliantly reproduces and when folks describe their jobs in a McPhee essay, one assumes they are describing them to McPhee.  Their absence from the text then becomes more intrusive than their presence would be, but, what the hey, they're two of the best writers of non-fiction ever to come down the pike, so we cut them some slack.  Infinitely more annoying is the way that every hack writer on Earth who is assigned to write a profile of someone for a magazine, begins the piece by describing his own first meeting with the subject of the story, as if we freakin' care that the author ordered the shitaki on melba toast and Demi was ten minutes late for the interview.  But topping them all for the most aggravating technique ever created is Norman Mailer who decided to include himself in his nonfiction but to write about himself in the third person, as &quot;the reporter.&quot;  This is not only a distraction when you are reading, it also just smacks of egotism run amok.  Of course, this is Norman Mailer, the biggest publicity whore this side of Madonna, so that's exactly what it is, the attention grabbing stunt of a completely self-absorbed horse's rump.<br />That said, he does make for an irreverent, even ribald, chronicler of the 1968 conventions.  His celebrity opened doors for him and gave him access to the placid doings of the GOP conclave in Miami and to the Democratic melee in Chicago.  He uses his own distinctive patois of street tough language, acerbic commentary and apocalyptic hyperbole to recreate the mood, if not the actual events of the two conventions.  But his analysis of events is completely laughable, teetering between the merely absurd and the genuinely deluded.  Naturally, he revels in both the counter culture demonstrations in Chicago and in the somewhat heavy-handed response of Mayor Daley's police and the National Guard.  Like Charlie Manson believing that Helter Skelter would bring about the revolution, Mailer thought that this kind of confrontation and the reaction it provoked revealed something about the strength of the youth movement on the one hand and weakness of American institutions on the other.  In fact, these were pretty much the death throes of '60s radicalism.  Just a few months later the American people would go to the polls and elect Richard Nixon, largely on the understanding that he would restore law and order to American society.  And though his margin of victory was quite thin, it must be recalled that George Wallace received 13.5% of the vote; and I think it's safe to say that his voters disagreed with the kids who tried shutting down Chicago.  Even as Mailer was predicting a new and glorious phase in some kind of class struggle, the electorate, the &quot;silent majority&quot; of Nixon's acceptance speech, was preparing to repudiate the radical movement by a truly staggering margin.<br />Interestingly, Mailer accidentally offers intimations of what was going on in the rest of the country when he is too revealing about what was going on within himself.  The two most honest moments in the book are when he expresses how sick he is of listening to the demands of Black leaders:<br />  [T]he reporter became aware after a while of a curious emotion in himself, for he had not ever  felt it consciously before--it was a simple emotion and very unpleasant to him--he was getting  tired of Negroes and their rights.  It was a miserable recognition, and on many a count, for if even  he felt this way, then what immeasurable tides of rage must be loose in America itself?<br />Note both the utter condescension to the unwashed masses and the visceral sense that things had gone far enough.  Add in the fact that most Americans were also sick of listening to limousine liberals like Norman Mailer tell them what to do, when they knew perfectly well that he felt like this in his heart of hearts, and the rage is only compounded.  Mailer's slip peeks out again during the violence in Chicago when he acknowledges an illicit thrill at watching the police hammer protesters into submission.  These instances offer him a chance to understand what is truly going on in the country, but his knees jerk and he goes right back to singing a Dionysian song of praise to the scum in the streets.<br />A journalist who gets so involved in a story that he misjudges it by as much as Mailer did is hardly worthy of the title.  Instead, the author was a partisan observer whose analytical skills appear to be nonexistent and whose judgment appears to have been clouded by emotion, but whose hands on approach to the story makes for a whiff of the atmospherics of the time and some mildly interesting moments.<br />GRADE: Cimousine liberals like Norman Mailer tell them what to do, when they knew perfectly well that he felt like this in his heart of hearts, and the rage is only compounded.

On the one hand, for anyone who loves Raymond Chandler and Philip Marlowe, as I do, it is great to have a new story featuring the &quot;Galahad of the Gutter&quot;, even if Chandler only wrote the first three chapters.  And Robert B. Parker ( of Spenser fame) does a competent job of completing the story.<br />On the other hand, despite the exception of Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man, I think that the modern trend of giving private eyes buddies and girlfriends has been a catastrophic development for the hard boiled novel.  The very essence of these novels, epitomized in The Maltese Falcon, Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer series and the other Philip Marlowe stories, is the independence and accompanying vulnerability of the detectives.  So this Marlowe story, which finds him married to a wealthy heiress and comfortably ensconced in Poodle Springs (a thinly veiled Pal Springs), is disappointing evidence that even a master of the genre was drifting in this direction when he died.<br />The mystery here is vintage Chandler, with blackmail, pornography, polygamy and the like and when the focus turns to Marlowe working on the case it is quite good.  But the scenes between him and his wife, particularly the tensions between them as a result of his insistence on a return to detecting, bring the story to a screeching halt every time it builds up a head of steam.<br />The result is a very mixed bag and an extremely tentative recommendation--an airplane book.<br />GRADE: C	2000-11-22

Now he's taking some time to drift around the United States, checking out the haunts of old time blues greats, before he decides what to do next.  But the decision is made for him when he's arrested for murder in Margrave, Georgia.  He quickly proves to the black, Boston-transplant, chief of detectives that he's not guilty and prepares to move on, until it turns out that the murder victim was Reacher's brother, Joe, a Treasury agent.  Intent on revenge, Reacher starts digging, with the help of the Chief and a friendly woman police officer, and quickly uncovers a mammoth conspiracy as the corpses start piling up.<br />Take equal parts In the Heat of the Night, The Postman Always Rings Twice, Point of Impact and Rambo, give them a good shake and you've pretty much got this interesting, though flawed, debut thriller by a British author.  I saw flawed because the plot is simply driven by too many coincidences and epiphanies; Reacher makes so many intuitive leaps that it starts to become somewhat annoying.  On the other hand, Reacher is a likable hero and Child is clearly trying to hit a home run with this modern noir.  He started out in British television and his writing has a sort of cinematic quality to it, the book reads like a movie.  I'll give him credit for a decent first effort and assume the subsequent installments will be even better.  In fact, I've already bought the second book.<br />GRADE: B-	2000-11-22

I am merely a genius, not a god.  -Nero Wolfe<br />Rex Stout was in the midst of an unusually interesting life (including being a child math prodigy and serving on President Theodore Roosevelt's yacht) when he created one of the great detective series of all time, introducing Nero Wolfe for the first of 72 adventures in Fer-de-Lance.  The brilliance of Stout's creation lies in the blending of Wolfe--an eccentric, elephantine, misanthropic, misogynistic, beer guzzling, gourmand--and his footman, Archie Goodwin--a classic, wise cracking, hard boiled dick.  The combination, sort of like teaming Mycroft Holmes and Sam Spade, allowed him to use the best elements of both the British drawing room mystery and the American private eye novel.  The result has enchanted readers for almost 70 years. Fans include everyone from Oliver Wendell Holmes to PG Wodehouse, James M. Cain to Kingsley Amis.<br />Nero Wolfe, logging in around 280 lbs and quaffing 6 quarts of beer a day, rarely leaves his 35th Street brownstone in Manhattan, preferring to tend his orchids and worry over the exquisite meals prepared by his butler/chef Fritz.  To support his high living, Wolfe takes on investigations in a very unofficial capacity, relying on Goodwin to do the physical work and periodically summoning the principals in a case to his home for an exhibition of his deductive genius.  His arrogant manner is nicely captured in the following admonition to a sporting goods salesman who has condescendingly demonstrated the proper use of golf clubs:<br />  You know, Mr. Townsend, it is our good fortune that the exigencies of birth and training furnish all  of us with opportunities for snobbery.  My ignorance of this special nomenclature provided yours;  your innocence of the elementary processes provides mine.<br />Meanwhile, Archie narrates the stories in the familiar sardonic banter of the great noir novels:<br />  When I consider the different kinds I've seen it seems silly to say it, but somehow to me all lawyers  look alike.  It's a sort of mixture of a scared look and a satisfied look, as if they were crossing a  traffic-filled street where they expect to get run over any minute but they know exactly what kind  of paper to hand the driver if they get killed and they've got one right in their pocket.<br />This sets up an amusing dramatic tension between the two, as when Nero tells Archie:<br />  Sit down.  I would prefer to have you here, idle and useless...As I have remarked before, to have  you with me like this is always refreshing because it constantly reminds me how distressing it  would be to have someone present--a wife, for instance--whom I could not dismiss at will.<br />Lest it seem that Wolfe is to much of an egomaniac to be tolerated, Archie makes it clear that he stays around just for the sheer joy of watching the elephantine savant in action and Wolfe himself acknowledges that much of his facade is mere pretense when a District Attorney commands his presence in Westchester, he tells Archie to refuse, saying &quot;I understand the technique of eccentricity; it would be futile for a man to labor at establishing a reputation for oddity if he were ready at the slightest provocation to revert to normal action.&quot;  And Wolfe sometimes lets slip his admiration for Archie, telling a witness in the case, &quot;Mr. Goodwin is a man of discretion, common decency and immeasurable valor.&quot;<br />It has long been a theory of mine that if you create characters of sufficient interest to enrapture your audience, you can get away with not always cranking out a top flight story, we'll show up just to spend some time with familiar friends (this carried Magnum PI and Cheers through some mighty lean episodes &amp; even whole seasons).

They were, as far as I can recall, pretty faithful to the original stories, though obviously abridged and edited.  I remember two in particular, The Count of Monte Cristo and Cyrano de Bergerac.  The appeal of these two, despite their French provenance, is obvious--what more can a kid ask for than a great swashbuckler?  Then, as if this cartoon version wasn't enough, I saw the 1950 Jose Ferrer film version of Cyrano and was hooked on the story for life.<br />Rostand's is just one of several fictions to be based on the life of the historical Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac (1619-55).  Set in the reign of Louis XIII, the play, of course. tells the story of the fiercely independent swordsmen, poet, playwright and political pamphleteer with the prodigious proboscis, of his unspoken love for his cousin Roxanne and of his intercession on behalf of his beautiful fellow guardsman Christian de Neuvillette, on whose behalf he surreptitiously woos her.<br />Now when you're a kid, you can hardly see past the dueling and brawling.  I mean, obviously the point is that the guy is lovable despite his beak, but c'mon, the love parts are yucky anyway.  But returning to the story as an adult, Rostand's other themes emerge, particularly Cyrano's insistence on meeting life on his own terms.  If his failure to realize Roxanne's love remains tragic, his Quixotic nature, his enduring political independence and personal integrity, serve to make him one of the great heroes in all of literature.<br />Blending swordplay, comedy, tragedy and romance in equal measure, this is truly one of the most thrilling dramas of all time.  If you can find the cartoon version, by all means watch it.  In the meantime, instead of renting Lethal Weapon # 8, next time you're at the video store look for Jose Ferrer as Cyrano or buy a copy from Amazon for 7 bucks.

Goldhagen challenges the accepted view that the Nazis were an aberration &amp; were solely responsible for the Holocaust.  Instead he argues that the virulent eliminationist anti-semitism that fueled the Holocaust was a unique and  intrinsic part of German Culture and that the entire society voluntarily participated in it's enactment.<br />Goldhagen's demonstration of the guilt of &quot;ordinary&quot; Germans seems pretty incontrovertible.  One section of the book focuses on a single police unit to show that the perpetrators of the Holocaust were average Germans and not fanatic Nazis.  He shows that they could refuse orders they disagreed with and not suffer dire consequences, but in fact they did not choose to challenge the orders to round up and slaughter Jews.  Indeed, they willingly share the news of what they are doing with their families &amp; have candid photos taken when they are performing their duties.  They hardly seem like unwilling parties.<br />On the other hand, Goldhagen's single-minded focus on Germany and the eliminationist anti-semitism of the Germans seems too limited.  After all, even setting aside the Eastern Europeans, the French certainly seem to have been eager participants.  Wasn't this a function of French anti-semitism?  If so, how can we say that German eliminationist anti-semitism was unique?  Goldhagen has done a great service by refusing to absolve the &quot;ordinary&quot; German from guilt in the Holocaust, why absolve the rest of Europe?<br />Moreover, there's a certain blithe assumption that modern Germany is fundamentally different from Nazi Germany and that such a thing could never happen again.  One need only look at the current ethnic tensions in Germany and France to see that this assumption may be to hasty.  Is it really that difficult to imagine France and Germany slaughtering their current immigrant Arab populations?  I think not.<br />These caveats aside, this is a terrific book, one that is fundamental to understanding the Holocaust.<br />GRADE: Aeats aside, this is a terrific book, one that is fundamental to understanding the Holocaust. <br />GRADE: A	2000-11-21

In essence, he learns that he must clear his mind of all external clutter until all that exists is the bow, the arrow and the target.  But the process of learning this seemingly simple lesson is continually stymied by his stubborn adherence to Western ideas.<br />This is a pleasant enough little book, but one problem with this and with the exaltation of Zen in general is that Westerners routinely do exactly what practitioners of Zen do, without making such an elaborate production out of it. There is a great scene in John McPhee's A Sense of Where You Are : A Profile of William Warren Bradley, when Bradley is just lighting it up in the NCAA tournament and he feels like he's hogging the ball, but he's so hot that his teammates just keep giving him the ball.  He keeps making shots and they won't take any until he misses, so he starts taking increasingly ridiculous shots and they keep going in.  In the cliche of the moment, he has found the Zone.<br />Anyone who has ever flashbowled, knows the sensation that occurs when you become one with the lights and start throwing 800's, and, hell, that's typically after 15 beers and you don't see me writing Zen in the Art of Flashbowling..<br />hmmmmmm?<br />GRADE: C+	2000-11-21

So look  at it this way, John Gay was the Sex Pistols of his day and The Beggar's Opera  hit London like  Never Mind the Bollocks....<br />Since Italian opera had first come to London in 1705, it had dominated the  British stage. Replete with ornate sets, elaborate costumes, unintelligible  plots and imported sopranos and castrati, it was less art than event. Audiences  attended to share in the spectacle, as chariots swooped through the air &amp;  romantic tales unfolded on stage.  Into this artificial world, Gay unleashed an opera about the scum of London  society, set in taverns and thieves' dens. He tells the story of Peachum, a  fence with a lucrative sideline in informing on fellow criminals. His daughter  Polly has secretly married MacHeath, a highwayman. Now Peachum and his &quot;wife&quot;  fear that MacHeath will inform on them &amp; inherit their loot when they are  hanged. After berating Polly for marrying, &amp; not having sense enough to live  out of wedlock, they decide to turn MacHeath in, before he can turn them in. As  Peachum prepares his daughter for this turn of events he tells her: &quot;The  comfortable estate of widowhood, is the only hope that keeps up a wife's  spirits. Where is the woman who would scruple to be a wife, if she had it in  her power to be a widow whenever she pleased?&quot; However, to the Peachum's  disgust, Polly is actually in love with MacHeath and so, to her great surprise,  are several other women, including Lucy Lockit who helps him to escape from  prison. So, the stage is set for a madcap farce.  Mix in a satiric look at the corrupt administration of justice, some political  jabs at the political master of the day, Sir Robert Walpole and songs like the  following:<br />  A fox may steal your hens, sir  A whore your health and pence, sir,  Your daughter rob your chest, sir  Your wife may steal your rest, sir,  A thief your goods and plate.  But this is all but picking,  With rest, pence, chest and chicken;  It ever was decreed, sir,  If lawyer's hand is fee'd, sir,  He steals your whole estate.<br />and you've got Gay's recipe for what quickly became the most popular play of the  18th Century, fathering myriad imitations including Brecht's Threepenny Opera.

In the Introduction to the Second John McPhee Reader, David Remnick (now McPhee's editor at The New Yorker) notes that many people find McPhee's subjects too obscure &amp; are put off by his decision to remain &quot;distant from politics, preferring to make something of very little.&quot;  I don't doubt that this is true, but I feel sorry for people who miss out on reading his terrific work because they feel that way.  Over nearly 40 years of writing non-fiction essays for The New Yorker, McPhee has crafted a body of great literature by immersing himself in a variety of American subcultures and explicating them for the general public.  In Pine Barrens, by discussing everything from growing cranberries to the natural history of fires to the legend of the Jersey Devil and introducing us to a cast of fascinating characters along the way, McPhee accomplishes what only the best writers can, he brings alive an entire world that might otherwise have remained unknown to us.

But Nobel Laureate Luigi Pirandello had a specific use for the concept; he wanted to demonstrate the fine line that separates reality and fiction.  He did so most famously in the play Six Characters in Search of an Author.<br />The play opens with a theater company getting ready to begin a rehearsal.  As the director tries to bring some order to the proceedings, six people walk in off of the street looking for an author.  They want someone to dramatize their sordid true life story.  The tale that they unfold is in fact so melodramatic that the director has his troupe start acting out the six characters and repeating their lines.  Meanwhile, the six quibble with the actors' interpretations and with the reproduced dialogue and even argue with the director over whether it is possible or appropriate for anyone other than the six to play themselves.<br />The premise and structure of the play are amusing and thought provoking.  One can only imagine how Pirandello would react to the permutations we see spun out today with reality tv and instant tv movies based on real events, even those we've all just witnessed on live tv like the OJ trial.  In fact, just recently on the X-Files, Scully and Mulder were working with a police force which was being filmed for the live action show COPS.  Fictional characters pretending to be on a &quot;real&quot; show, but the players on the &quot;real&quot; show are fictional for this episode...  He would have loved it.  But ultimately the actual content of this play seems to be totally superfluous.  The ingenious set up is the whole point and so it ends up resembling one of those Saturday Night Live skits that doesn't know when enough is enough.

Burroughs, a professor at Bowdoin, published a terrific collection of essays Billy Watson's Croker Sack in 1991 (it even made Mr. Doggett's Suggested Summer Reading List for Students) and this book is every bit as good.<br />Whether he's detailing the history of the county, the river and his own family or relating his encounters with the river's unique residents or describing the wildlife he encounters, Burroughs has a sharp eye, a sympathetic ear and a silver tongue.  Here is his description of one bird he meets:<br />  Yesterday a red-shouldered hawk had called the day to order, and got its business underway.  Today it was a pileated woodpecker: a staccato drum-burst against a hollow tree, then the bird  itself.  It flew across in front of me, with its peculiar alternation of flap, swoop, and collapse, and  its last swoop fetched it up against the trunk of a cypress.  It clung there a moment, cocked and  primed, a perfectly congruous mixture of Woody Woodpecker, frock-coated nineteenth-century  deacon and pterodactyl.  Then it gave the tree an abrupt, jackhammer strafing, rolled out its lordly  call, and swooped away, leaving the day to its own devices.<br />If you've ever seen one, you know that a pileated woodpecker has never been described better and if you haven't you must almost feel that now you have.<br />This is a wonderful bucolic look at the history and nature of the Waccamaw, which will leave you wishing that you too had such a place  coursing through your blood.<br />GRADE: Arimed, a perfectly congruous mixture of Woody Woodpecker, frock-coated nineteenth-century      deacon and pterodactyl.

But then you pick up a book by a John McPhee (see reviews above), a Roger Angell, a Joseph Mitchell, a Berton Roueche or a David Remnick and you realize what extraordinary pieces of journalism appear first in it's pages.  Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief is the latest example.  A general contributor to the magazine, she describes her style thus:<br />  I read lots of local newspapers and particularly the shortest articles in them, and most particularly  any articles that are full of words in combinations that are arresting. In the case of the orchid  story, I was interested to see the words 'swamp' and 'orchids' and 'Seminoles' and 'cloning' and  'criminal' together in one short piece. Sometimes this kind of story turns out to be something more,  some glimpse of life that expands like those Japanese paper balls you drop in water and then after  a moment they bloom into flowers, and the flower is so marvelous that you can't believe there was  a time when all you saw in front of you was a paper ball and a glass of water.<br />Well, as it turns out, this story is equal to her beautiful metaphor.<br />In 1994, John Laroche, the &quot;orchid thief&quot; and  three Seminole Indian men, were caught leaving a Florida Wildlife Preserve with bags full of Ghost orchid (Polyrrhiza lindenii) specimens. They challenged the arrest on the basis of a law allowing Native tribes to violate the endangered species act and some other rigmarole.  Orleans went to Florida to get the story, befriended the weirdly charismatic Laroche and gained entry to the bizarre world of orchid collectors.  As the story unfolds, she presents a detailed portrait of Laroche and dutifully reports on the court case, but she also offers a thorough natural history of orchids, with fascinating digressions on Florida itself, the Seminole Indians, etc.,  and of man's obsession with these remarkable plants.  The incredible lengths that collectors, and the hunters they employ, have gone to in order to find rare orchids makes for an original read.  But ultimately, the book becomes a kind of obsession with obsession:<br />  I suppose that is exactly what I was doing in Florida, figuring out how people found order and  contentment and a sense of purpose in the universe by fixing their sights on one single thing or one  belief or one desire.<br />One is inevitably reminded of Rex Stout's great eccentric detective Nero Wolfe (see Orrin's review of Fer-de-Lance: A Nero Wolfe Mystery), whose very oddity was symbolized by his obsession with orchids.  Orlean writes of her own efforts to avoid this fate, refusing to keep any of the plants that people pressed upon her, but the book ends with her tramping through a godforsaken swamp in search of a glimpse of the Ghost orchid that started the whole case.  In the end, even she has been consumed by this passion for a flower.<br />Now when I was a kid I experienced an epiphany thanks to a bag of rock salt.  Bags of Hailite used to show a polar bear carrying a bag of Hailite with the salt spilling out onto ice and, of course, the bag the bear was carrying repeated the same picture and so on and so on...  For the first time it struck me that this was an infinite series--the picture of the bear would continue ad infinitum.  Which brings us back to Susan Orlean.  If you set out to write about obsessive orchid collectors and become obsessed with them in turn, are you writing about obsession or demonstrating it?

When Henry VIII unexpectedly became heir to the British throne upon his brother's death, the Pope made a special dispensation to allow him to marry his brother's widow, the politically desirable Spanish princess Catherine.  Later, when Queen Catherine failed to produce a male heir for King Henry and as she became increasingly plain and more deeply religious, Henry sought to have the Pope nullify the marriage for the very reason that it violated Christian law for a man to marry his brother's widow.  Sir Thomas More resigned his post as Lord Chancellor of England in 1532 because of his opposition to Henry's plan.  Henry having taken England out of the Catholic Church and established the Church of England with himself at its head, Anne Boleyn was crowned his new Queen in June of 1533.  Henry passed the Act of Succession in March 1534, which required all who should be called upon to take an oath acknowledging the issue of Henry and Anne as legitimate heirs to the throne, and to this was added a clause repudiating &quot;any foreign authority, prince or potentate&quot;.  More was summoned on March 14, but refused to take the oath and was sent to the Tower of London.  He was indicted for treason in July and at trial solicitor-general Richard Rich testified that More had denied Parliament's power to invest Henry with ecclesiastical powers.  Despite More's denial of the statement and his avowal that Rich was a perjurer, he was convicted and was beheaded at Tower Hill on July 6, 1535.  For his willingness to be executed rather than renounce his oath to the Pope and the Catholic Church,  Thomas More became a martyr and was eventually sainted.  Protestant England became the greatest nation on Earth and developed the political, religious and economic institutions upon which all successful modern nations are based.<br />Robert Bolt's great play presents in simple, unadorned scenes, the dilemma of a man of conscience and serves to remind us of how rare and valuable such men are in every age.  Bolt's More argues that a man who will sacrifice his conscience has lost something central to his being:<br />  When a man takes an oath, Meg, he's holding his own self in his own hands. Like water....and if he  opens his fingers then--he needn't hope to find himself again...<br />And in the play's greatest passage, he argues for the centrality of the law, over and against men, in the governance of human affairs, when his family wants him to have the disloyal Rich arrested:<br />  Wife:  Arrest him!<br />  More:  For what?<br />  Wife:  He's dangerous!<br />  Roper:  For all we know he's a spy!<br />  Daughter:  Father, that man's bad!<br />  More:  There's no law against that!<br />  Roper:  There is, God's law!<br />  More:  Then let God arrest him!<br />  Wife:  While you talk he's gone!<br />  More:  And go he should, if he were the Devil himself, until he broke the law!<br />  Roper:  So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law!<br />  More:  Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?<br />  Roper:  Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that!<br />  More:  Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would  you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?<br />  This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if  you cut them down (and you're just the man to do it!), do you really think you could stand  upright in the winds that would blow then?<br />  Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!<br />Finally, when he is brought before the Court, More warns those assembled: &quot;It is a long road you have opened for first men will disclaim their hearts and presently they will have no hearts. God help the people whose statesmen walk your road.&quot;<br />[For those of us of a certain age and political persuasion, these lines will always call to mind the impassioned plea by Henry Hyde (R, IL) for the Senate to hold President Clinton answerable to the laws of the land.  But then as in More's time, there were hardly any ready to withstand the leveling political wind that was blowing.  No Cabinet Member or Administration employee resigned in the face of the President's misconduct and lies.  No Democrat Senator voted for a single article of impeachment; all succumbed to the cult of personality.  It was particularly appalling to watch men like Moynihan, Lieberman and Byrd betray every principle for which they have spoken in public life.  For one awful, but thankfully brief moment, we saw the dread specter of what it's like to live in a world where the whims of men are paramount, and the rule of law a farce.  Well might we, like More, ask God to help a nation where the statesmen have no hearts, where they place their masters above the law.]<br />In the end, Henry's actions set England upon the path to becoming a great nation and made him a world historical figure.  But even, or especially, a great nation needs men like Thomas More, who stand willing to vindicate the rule of law regardless of their personal feelings and interests.  More, who followed the dictates of conscience, rather than the diktats of a king, is truly one of the great men of history and remains a vital example to all mankind.<br />GRADE: A+our road.&quot; <br />[For those of us of a certain age and political persuasion, these lines will always call to mind the impassioned plea by Henry Hyde (R, IL) for the Senate to hold President Clinton answerable to the laws of the land.

What is the sense  of an educational system that devotes a huge proportion of it's resources to  nearly ineducable students?<br />The most interesting part of the book may be his examination of the motivation  behind the regulatory scheme we now face.  He points out that the original  motivation for regulation was fairness.  Social policy planners believed that  only be having an elaborate &amp; inflexible pattern of regulation that covered  every eventuality, could you guarantee that bureaucrats would be freed from  outside influences.  However, the result has been to require that everyone  follow the same scheme of rules, regardless of whether they make any sense.<br />As Howard argues, this has brought us to a crisis point in American life.  We  are increasingly frustrated by the intrusion of these rules into our lives,  increasingly distrustful of government &amp; increasingly willing to find ways  around these regulations.<br />However, and this is a significant weakness of the book, Howard does not offer a  real prescription for these problems.  His critique is powerful enough that it's  hard to believe that we wouldn't be better off if we scrapped all government  regulation &amp; started over, but Howard understandably shies away from any such  radical solution.<br />GRADE:  Bfrustrated by the intrusion of these rules into our lives,  increasingly distrustful of government &amp; increasingly willing to find ways  around these regulations. <br />However, and this is a significant weakness of the book, Howard does not offer a  real prescription for these problems.

What's he angry about? mostly the commonly accepted  portrait of black males in the media and among intellectual elites, &amp; especially  the black conservatives who help foster what he feels is an inaccurate image.  They are &quot;airing dirty laundry&quot; or as he puts it: &quot;The profitable literary scam  nowadays is to pose as someone who airs unpleasant and frank facts about the  black community, only to be condemned by the black community for doing so. This  is the sure way to grants, awards, prizes, fellowships, and academic positions.&quot;<br />But these black conservatives are not alone as objects of Reed's scorn; they are  joined by: George Will, Pat Buchanan, feminists, NPR, The New York Review of  Books, The Color Purple, Oprah Winfrey, Desiree Washington, the FBI, Anita Hill,  etc. All of them are viewed as having victimized black men, especially the  &quot;underclass&quot;, in general and specifically, Mike Tyson, Clarence Thomas &amp; Marion  Barry.<br />Every one of Mr. Reed's polemics is impassioned and amusing. And while he seems  to have swallowed whole every crackpot conspiracy theory to come down the pike,  including blaming heroin, crack and AID's on the US government, there is  something ineffably wonderful about a man who can refer to Harper's, New York  Times Magazine, NPR and PBS as &quot;powerful sections of neoconservative opinion&quot; in  one breath and in the next, refer to them as bastions of feminism.<br />Don't get me wrong; I disagreed with almost every sentence in this book, but it  was a joy to read.<br />GRADE: C+	2000-11-21

Nelson has spoken to many of the participants and assembled what appears to be a well-balanced overview of the promise and problems of the Party.<br />His essential argument is that the Party began as a criminal enterprise with revolutionary trappings and was eventually consumed by it's own criminality.  The book was apparently somewhat controversial because this, of course, contradicts the standard view that the Panthers began as a worthy endeavor but was tragically destroyed by increasing criminal activity and mismanagement and illegal government meddling.<br />Despite some awkward prose, this is an excellent look at the turn from non-violence to violence in the Black Community in the mid-60's.<br />GRADE: B	2000-11-21

Based on what I've seen on the  rest of the list, this is Oprah's acorn.<br />Before coming to America, Genob Sarhang Massoud Amir Behrani was a colonel in the Iranian Air  Force.  Forced to flee when the Shah fell, he escaped with his wife and two children and a couple  hundred thousand dollars.  Now resettled in the San Francisco area, but thus far unable to find work in  the aerospace industry, Behrani works two full time jobs, on a road crew and as a convenience store  clerk.  This labor is necessary because the family's money is dwindling quickly, thanks to his wife's  insistence on maintaining their old standard of living and the need to put on a sufficiently opulent  facade to get his daughter safely married off--for instance, their apartment costs $3000 per month.  Then one day, noticing an announcement of a tax auction in the newspaper, he decides to use their  remaining savings to buy the house and then try to turn it around quickly for a profit.<br />Meanwhile, the house had previously belonged to Kathy Niccolo, a recovering alcoholic whose addict  husband has run out on her.  She works as an independent house cleaner, barely making ends meet and  ignored the county tax bill because it should not have been assessed against her house.  But now she  has been evicted and, though Legal Aid lawyers help her to win a judgment from the county, they can  not make Behrani give up the house, only compensate her.  She also receives help from Sheriff Lester  Burdon, whose marriage has lost it's passion, and the two become lovers.  Together, and separately,  they begin to take steps to force the Behranis out of their new home.  Things get ugly.<br />This book is a page turner anyway, but it enveloped me in such a cloud of dread that I just kept  reading faster and faster because I couldn't stand the thought of what was to come.  I know some of  the reviewers have said that Dubus evokes sympathy for all the characters; I strongly disagree.  Colonel Behrani is a perfect example of why anti-immigration policies are insane.  He works his tail  off to provide a better life for his family and wants nothing from anyone except to be left alone to  pursue the American Dream.  He resembles a tragic hero, whose stubborn pride and unshakable faith  in his dreams collude to help destroy him.<br />Kathy, on the other hand, even setting aside her addiction problems, has irresponsibly allowed legal  events to get out of hand and now burns with a sense of false entitlement.  Her lackadaisical approach  to her job stands in stark contrast to Behrani's willingness to humble himself to take virtually any job.  Her relationship with Lester results in his leaving a wife and two young children, a wife whose only  failure is that Lester feels for her as he would towards a sister--hardly reason to destroy a family.  And  this step is merely Lester's first in a chain which becomes increasingly dubious, until his behavior can  only be defined as pathological.  By the end of the story I was begging Behrani to go and get a gun  and put these two out of his misery.<br />Andre Dubus III is the son of one of America's greatest short story writers.  His Dad having passed on,  it's heartening to see him pick up the reigns.  But please, have mercy on the reader; I could barely  stand the last hundred pages of this book, I was so distraught.

Park believes that, &quot;Minerals are where you find  them. The quantities are finite.&quot; So you go &amp; get them wherever they are  located. McPhee goes with them as they hike through the mountains.<br />(2) Charles Fraser, developer of Hilton Head Island's Sea Pines Plantation, who  has obtained 3000 acres on undeveloped Cumberland Island. Fraser has bent over  backwards in previous developments to preserve as much of the original landscape  as he could, but he considers all environmentalists to be &quot;druids&quot; who will  sacrifice people to save trees.<br />&amp; (3) Floyd Dominy, United States Commissioner of Reclamation and devoted dam  builder. McPhee brings them together to walk the Glen Canyon Dam. As McPhee  says, dams cause a visceral reaction among environmentalists because,  &quot;Humiliating nature, a dam is evil...&quot; .<br />By bringing these men of starkly different viewpoint together &amp; letting them  speak for themselves, McPhee presents us with a dialogue that is pretty  balanced. It is a significant contribution to our understanding of how the two  sides in the preservation vs. development debate came to be so absolutist. As  Brower says at one point: &quot;Objectivity is the greatest threat to the United  States today.&quot; But one finishes the book wondering if making totally subjective  judgments and arguments has really helped the environment or cause of environmentalism.<br />GRADE: B+	2000-11-21

Eliot's short play, Murder in the Cathedral, was originally written for the Canterbury festival and tells the story of the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett (1118-70) by Henry II's henchmen.  It is essentially an extended lyrical consideration of the proper residence of temporal and spiritual power, of the obligations of religious believers to the commands of the State, and of the possibility that piety can be selfish unto sin.<br />Beckett is one of the more interesting characters from history.  Rising from a lowly birth in the Cheapside section of London, largely thanks to the patronage of Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1154 he became both archdeacon of Canterbury and Henry's chancellor.  Theobald expected him to defend the prerogatives of the Church, but instead he became fast friends with Henry, partook of a sybaritic lifestyle, and extended the power of the State at the expense of the Church.  So when Theobald was succeeded by Beckett, Henry expected to have a compliant ally running the Church, but instead Beckett adopted an ascetic lifestyle and became a fearsome defender of the rights of the Church.  After dividing on many minor issues, matters came to a head when Henry tried exerting the authority of Crown courts to punish clerics who had been convicted by ecclesiastical courts.  Henry determined to reign him in, put Beckett on trial for misappropriating funds while serving as Chancellor, and Beckett was forced to flee to France.<br />The play opens as Beckett returns to Canterbury in December of 1170, after seven years in exile.  Four Tempters approach him, separately, and offer him reasons why he should cease to resist Henry.  The first Tempter offers the prospect of physical safety if he will go along to get along :<br />  The safest beast is not the one that roars most loud,  This was not the way of the King our master!  You were not used to be so hard upon sinners  When they were your friends.  Be easy, man!  The easy man lives to eat the best dinners.  Take a friend's advice.  Leave well alone,  Or your goose may be cooked and eaten to the bone.<br />The second offers worldly power, riches and fame in the service of the King :<br />  King commands.  Chancellor richly rules,  This is a sentence not taught in schools.  To set down the great, protect the poor,  Beneath the throne of God can man do more?  Disarm the ruffian, strengthen the laws,  Rule for the good of the better cause,  Dispensing justice make all even,  Is thrive on earth, and perhaps in heaven.<br />The third offers him an alliance with the barons and the opportunity to work against the King :<br />  For a powerful party  Which has turned its eyes in your direction--  To gain from you, your Lordship asks.  For us, Church favour would be an advantage,  Blessing of Pope powerful protection  In the fight for liberty.  You, my Lord,  In being with us, would fight a good stroke  At once, for England and for Rome,  Ending the tyrannous jurisdiction  Of king's court over bishop's court,  Of king's court over baron's court.<br />The final Tempter, who may be the Devil himself, offers Beckett the chance to supplant the King, but with a caveat :<br />  Fare forward to the end.  all other ways are closed to you  Except the way already chosen.  But what is pleasure, kingly rule,  Or rule of men beneath a king,  With craft in corners, stealthy stratagem,  To general grasp of spiritual power?  Man oppressed by sin, since Adam fell--  You hold the keys of heaven and hell.  Power to bind and loose : bind, Thomas, bin,  King and bishop under your heel.  King, emperor, bishop, baron, king :  Uncertain mastery of melting armies,  War, plague, and revolution,  New conspiracies, broken pacts;  To be master or servant within an hour,  This is the course of temporal power.  The Old King shall know it, when at last breath,  No sons, no empire, he bites broken teeth.  You hold the skein : wind, Thomas, wind  The thread of eternal life and death.  You hold this power, hold it.<br />  THOMAS :<br />  Supreme, in this land?<br />  TEMPTER :<br />  Supreme, but for one.<br />And so Beckett resists this blandishment just as he has the others, but then the fourth Tempter cannily tempts him with his own dream, the desire for martyrdom :<br />  What can compare with glory of Saints  Dwelling forever in presence of God?  What earthly glory, of king or emperor,  what earthly pride, that is not poverty  Compared with richness of heavenly grandeur?  Seek the way of martyrdom, make yourself the lowest  On earth, to be high in heaven.  And see far off below you, where the gulf is fixed,  Your persecutors, in timeless torment,  Parched passion, beyond expiation.<br />Here Thomas Beckett realizes the peril of his own soul :<br />  Now is my way clear, now is the meaning plain:  Temptation shall not come in this kind again.  The last temptation is the greatest treason  To do the right deed for the wrong reason.<br />If he selfishly seeks martyrdom out of a personal desire for immortality, rather than selflessly accepting the risk of death while defending what he believes is right, then he will commit treason against the very Lord he is supposedly serving.<br />In Part Two of the play Beckett is confronted and murdered by Four Knights, acting at the behest, explicit or otherwise, of Henry.  Beckett had further antagonized Henry, upon his return, by opposing the coronation of Henry's son.  This prompted the King to his infamous utterance : &quot;Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?&quot;  On December 29, 1170, four knights of his court assassinated Beckett inside the Canterbury cathedral, turning an already heinous act into a cause celebre throughout Christendom.  Eliot uses this section of the play to explore the possibility that Beckett was actually wrong in his argument with Henry.<br />In their initial confrontation the Knights are quite worked up, but Beckett answers reasonably :<br />  THE THREE KNIGHTS :<br />  You are the Archbishop in revolt against the King; in  rebellion to the King and the law of the land;  You are the Archbishop who was made by the King;  whom he set in your place to carry out his command.  You are his servant, his tool, and his jack,  You wore his favors on your back,  You had your honours all from his hand; from him you  had the power, the seal and the ring.  This is the man who was the tradesman's son : the back-  stairs brat who was born in Cheapside;  This is the creature that crawled upon the King;  swollen with blood and swollen with pride.  Creeping out of the London dirt,  Crawling up like a louse on your shirt,  The man who cheated, swindled, lied; broke his oath  and betrayed his King.<br />  THOMAS :<br />  This is not true.  Both before and after I received the ring  I have been a loyal subject to the King.  Saving my order, I am at his command,  As his most faithful vassal in the land.<br />But is that &quot;Saving my order&quot; which sticks in the craw of royalists, the idea that Beckett owes a higher duty to the Church, on some things, than to the Crown.  Just as the Knights are about to strike him down they are interrupted by some priests and Beckett has time to prepare himself for the now inevitable end, though the priests urge him to hide :<br />  PRIESTS (Severally) :<br />  My Lord you must not stop here.  To the minster.  Through the cloister.  No time to waste.  They are com-  ing back, armed.  To the altar, to the altar.<br />  THOMAS :<br />  All my life they have been coming, these feet.  All my life  I have waited.  Death will come only when I am worthy,  And if I am worthy, there is no danger.  I have therefore only to make perfect my will.<br />Beckett can now sense that he is approaching the proper attitude of selflessness, that he is truly accepting martyrdom in defense of the ideas and ideals of the Church, rather than selfishly seeking martyrdom for personal reasons of fame and glory.  So when the Knights return and the priests propose barring the doors, he says :<br />  Unbar the doors!  throw open the doors!  I will not have the house of prayer, the church of Christ,  The sanctuary, turned into a fortress.  The Church shall protect her own, in her own way, not  As oak and stone; stone and oak decay,  Give no stay, but the Church shall endure.  The church shall be open, even to our enemies.  Open  the door!<br />Indeed, so long as the Church stood for a higher set of ideals, separate from petty political concerns, it did endure and served a vital function in society.  This endurance depended on the willingness of men like Beckett to sacrifice their all for these ideals, eschewing political power and wealth and running the risk of offending the temporal powers.<br />Eliot, however, does not leave it at that.  He also allows the murde throughout Christendom.  Eliot uses this section of the play to explore the possibility that Beckett was actually wrong in his argument with Henry. <br />In their initial confrontation the Knights are quite worked up, but Beckett answers reasonably : <br />    THE THREE KNIGHTS : <br />    You are the Archbishop in revolt against the King; in          rebellion to the King and the law of the land;      You are the Archbishop who was made by the King;          whom he set in your place to carry out his command.      You are his servant, his tool, and his jack,      You wore his favors on your back,      You had your honours all from his hand; from him you             had the power, the seal and the ring.      This is the man who was the tradesman's son : the back-              stairs brat who was born in Cheapside;      This is the creature that crawled upon the King;          swollen with blood and swollen with pride.      Creeping out of the London dirt,      Crawling up like a louse on your shirt,      The man who cheated, swindled, lied; broke his oath          and betrayed his King. <br />    THOMAS : <br />    This is not true.      Both before and after I received the ring      I have been a loyal subject to the King.      Saving my order, I am at his command,      As his most faithful vassal in the land. <br />But is that &quot;Saving my order&quot; which sticks in the craw of royalists, the idea that Beckett owes a higher duty to the Church, on some things, than to the Crown.  Just as the Knights are about to strike him down they are interrupted by some priests and Beckett has time to prepare himself for the now inevitable end, though the priests urge him to hide : <br />    PRIESTS (Severally) : <br />    My Lord you must not stop here.  To the minster.      Through the cloister.  No time to waste.  They are com-          ing back, armed.  To the altar, to the altar. <br />    THOMAS : <br />    All my life they have been coming, these feet.  All my lifeI have waited.  Death will come only when I am worthy,      And if I am worthy, there is no danger.      I have therefore only to make perfect my will. <br />Beckett can now sense that he is approaching the proper attitude of selflessness, that he is truly accepting martyrdom in defense of the ideas and ideals of the Church, rather than selfishly seeking martyrdom for personal reasons of fame and glory.

Junger tells the exciting story of those who faced the fury of that storm at sea and of the men who tried to rescue them.<br />The book is genuinely thrilling, as the reader gets caught up in the various survival struggles and rescue attempts. Throughout the book, Junger regales us with tales of storms past &amp; explains the physics of the storm &amp; the Sea. All of this is wonderful.<br />However, I have one major complaint with the structure of the book. He has built the story around the Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat out of Gloucester, MA, &amp; her crew of six. But as he tells us in the opening section of the book, the crewman are basically drunken louts who work the boats because those are the jobs available to them. They go to sea to make enough money to fuel the lives of dissipation they lead ashore. They just aren't very interesting people.<br />Moreover, the Andrea Gail, as we know early on, was lost with all hands, so Junger is forced to imagine what may have happened to them. This leads to an abundance of &quot;they must&quot;s &amp; &quot;inevitably&quot;s &amp; &quot;one imagine&quot;s. It's pretty unsatisfactory.<br />Meanwhile, the pararescue jumpers (rescue divers) &amp; the Coast Guard &amp; Navy helicopter crews are genuinely fascinating. Their dedication to their dangerous work is wondrous to behold and their feats of heroism are amazing. Yet they are shunted to the side in the book &amp; we are left wanting to know more about them &amp; their work.<br />Now I know that other folks I've talked to have not been much bothered by this &amp; I still enjoyed the book very much, so I wouldn't let this criticism deter you from reading it. It just bugged me.<br />GRADE: B-	2000-11-21

But I heard an interview with him the other day on NPR about his new book, From Dawn to Decadence - 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to Present, which sounds like it will be excellent, and then, serendipitously, I stumbled upon this fairly recent book of his essays.  As the title of his newer effort might lead you to assume, these essays reflect a profound concern about the direction in which modern culture is headed.  Tackling topics which range from government patronage of the arts to the writing of history to the teaching of Humanities, the book is unified by the theme of decline in the West, but it ends on an upbeat note as he assumes that the seeds of the next great Civilization must even now have been sown in the root of our culture.<br />Having taught at Columbia for over 60 years, Barzun is particularly interested in the complete hash that we have made of the academy.  In Where is History Now?, he offers a devastating critique of the way modern Historians have come to focus almost entirely on not merely social history, but the social history of marginal groups, to the exclusion of great persons, big events and sweeping trends.  He traces the beginnings of this problem to the Annales group in France, influenced by Durkheim and others:<br />  It was soon found that many kinds of documents existed, so far untouched and worth  exploiting--county archives, private contracts, children's books, records of matriculation at colleges  and universities, the police blotter in big cities, gravestones in cemeteries--a whole world of  commonplace papers and relics to be organized into meanings.  Such documents told nothing  important individually; they had to be classified and counted.  Theirs was a mass meaning, and it  brought one nearer to the life of the people; it satisfied democratic feelings.<br />One result of this search for arcania is that the history books that are produced are unreadable catalogues of stuff:<br />  History is not a piece of crockery dredged up from the Titanic; it is, first, the shipwreck, then a  piece of writing.  What is more, it is a piece of writing meant to be read, not merely entered on  shelves and in bibliographies.  By these criteria, modern man must be classed as a stranger to  history; he is not eager for it nor bothered by the lack of it.  The treasure hunt for artifacts seems to  him a sufficient acknowledgment of the past.<br />The other main result is that these historians end up specializing so completely in one discrete topic, even within the already unuseful field of social studies, that they lack any broader perspective.<br />He broaches this topic again in Exeunt the Humanities, wherein he particularly decries the tendency towards overspecialization:<br />  The danger is that we shall become a nation of pedants.  I use the word literally and democratically  to refer to the millions of people who are moved by a certain kind of passion in their pastimes as  well as in their vocations.  In both parts of their lives this passion comes out in shoptalk.  I have in  mind both the bird watchers and nature lovers: the young people who collect records and follow the  lives of pop singers and movie stars; I mean the sort of knowledge possessed by &quot;buffs&quot; and &quot;fans&quot;  of all species--the baseball addicts and opera goers, the devotees of railroad trains and the collectors  of objects, from first editions to netsuke.<br />  They are pedants not just because they know and recite an enormous quantity of facts--if a school  required them to learn as much they would scream against tyranny.  It is not the extent of their  information that appalls; it is the absence of any reflection upon it, any sense of relation between it  and them and the world.  Nothing is brought in from outside for contrast or comparison; no  perspective is gained from the top of their monstrous factual pile; no generalities emerge to lighten  the sameness of their endeavor.<br />If you wish to see an illustration of Barzun's basic point, stop by a newsstand some time and try to find yourself a good general interest magazine.  They no longer exist; there are of course many more types of magazines than ever before, but they are so specialized, tabloidized or politicized that you're unlikely to find more than one or two stories in each one that are actually worth reading for anyone other than a fanatic.<br />In one of the best essays in the collection he takes on the Bugbear of Relativism.  Moral relativism is one of the hackneyed phrases that we conservatives toss around to account for the wide variety of ills we discern in modern society.  Barzun deftly sketches a brief theory of the history of moral behavior, which posits that this problem is natural and cyclical:<br />  It is a commonplace that periods of strictness are followed by periods of looseness.  But what is it  that tells us in retrospect which is strict and which loose?  Surely the change observed is not in  morals, that is, in deep feelings rooted in conscience, which are by definition hidden.  The change  is in mores--conventions, attitudes, manners, speech, and the arts; in a word, what the people are  happy or willing to allow in public.<br />  I suggest further that this change precedes the swing of the moral pendulum.  This is not to say that  the change is one of surface only, a shift of fashion among the visible upper classes.  The public  gradually accepts change under the pressure of social need or cultural aims, then comes the loosening  or tightening of behavior in the lives of untold others beyond the fashion-makers.  Untold is the  word to bear in mind.  For throughout every change the good habits of millions remain constant--or  societies would fall apart; the bad habits likewise--or the police could be disbanded and the censors  silenced.<br />The insight here, the divergence between morals and mores, and the fact that the great majority of people continue to adhere to moral precepts regardless of the current mores, is especially compelling.  And the metaphor of the pendulum, implying as it does that the swing back must surely be coming, gives one great reason for hope.<br />These are just a couple of the issues that Barzun raises in this consistently interesting collection.  His writing is wise and witty and not at all pessimistic.  Even as he surveys the wreckage of our culture in the final essay, Toward the Twenty-First Century, though he provides one of the clearest definitions of the general concern that animates conservatives:<br />  The very notion of change, of which the twentieth century makes such a weapon in the advocacy of  every scheme, implies the notion of loss; for in society as in individual life many desirable things are  incompatible--to say nothing of the fact that the heedlessness or violence with which change takes  place brings about the incidental destruction of other useful attitudes and institutions.<br />he also ends on the hopeful note that:<br />  ...a last consolation for us--as long as man exists, civilization and all its works exist in germ.  Civilization is not identical with our civilization, and the rebuilding of states and cultures, now or at  any time, is integral to our nature and more becoming than longing and lamentations.<br />This kind of faith in mankind and an overall generosity of spirit serve the author well, tempering his often scathing indictment of modern culture with an optimism for the future which is all too unusual in conservative critics.  I look forward to reading his new book.<br />GRADE: Ay reflection upon it, any sense of relation between it      and them and the world.

Up until his time, plays had consisted of just one actor, changing masks if necessary.  But in addition to being an innovator, Aeschylus wrote one of the really pivotal works in the history of literature and of the human quest to understand our purpose in the universe: Prometheus Bound.<br />The parallels to the Biblical account of man's fall are obvious.  Prometheus is a Titan, more than human but less than God, like the angels.  He gives fire to mankind in violation of Zeus' orders, making man a threat to the gods.  Zeus punishes him by chaining him to a boulder where vultures peck out his innards every day, only to have them grow back at night, a little harsher than making the serpent crawl and banishing man from Eden, eh?  And so on...<br />The play opens as Prometheus is being bound by the reluctant Hephaestus, god of fire, who is the first of several characters to beg him to repent and apologize to Zeus.  Not only does Prometheus refuse, he is outwardly defiant of the king of the gods:<br />  PROMETHEUS  These things are sorrowful for me to speak,  Yet silence too is sorrow: all ways woe!  When first the Blessed Ones were filled with wrath  And there arose division in their midst,  These instant to hurl Cronos from his throne  That Zeus might be their king, and these, adverse,  Contending that he ne'er should rule the Gods,  Then I, wise counsel urging to persuade  The Titans, sons of Ouranos and Chthon,  Prevailed not: but, all indirect essays  Despising, they by the strong hand, effortless,  Yet by main force-supposed that they might seize  Supremacy. But me my mother Themis  And Gaia, one form called by many names,  Not once alone with voice oracular  Had prophesied how power should be disposed-  That not by strength neither by violence  The mighty should be mastered, but by guile.  Which things by me set forth at large, they scorned,  Nor graced my motion with the least regard.  Then, of all ways that offered, I judged best,  Taking my mother with me, to support,  No backward friend, the not less cordial Zeus.  And by my politic counsel Tartarus,  The bottomless and black, old Cronos hides  With his confederates. So helped by me,  The tyrant of the Gods, such service rendered  With ignominious chastisement requites.  But 'tis a common malady of power  Tyrannical never to trust a friend.  And now, what ye inquired, for what arraigned  He shamefully entreats me, ye shall know.  When first upon his high, paternal throne  He took his seat, forthwith to divers Gods  Divers good gifts he gave, and parcelled out  His empire, but of miserable men  Recked not at all; rather it was his wish  To wipe out man and rear another race:  And these designs none contravened but me.  I risked the bord attempt, and saved mankind  From stark destruction and the road to hell.  Therefore with this sore penance am I bowed,  Grievous to suffer, pitiful to see.  But, for compassion shown to man, such fate  I no wise earned; rather in wrath's despite  Am I to be reformed, and made a show  Of infamy to Zeus.<br />Later he explains just what the possession of knowledge will mean to mankind:<br />  PROMETHEUS  Think not that I for pride and stubbornness  Am silent: rather is my heart the prey  Of gnawing thoughts, both for the past, and now  Seeing myself by vengeance buffeted.  For to these younger Gods their precedence  Who severally determined if not I?  No more of that: I should but weary you  With things ye know; but listen to the tale  Of human sufferings, and how at first  Senseless as beasts I gave men sense, possessed them  Of mind. I speak not in contempt of man;  I do but tell of good gifts I conferred.  In the beginning, seeing they saw amiss,  And hearing heard not, but, like phantoms huddled  In dreams, the perplexed story of their days  Confounded; knowing neither timber-work  Nor brick-built dwellings basking in the light,  But dug for themselves holes, wherein like ants,  That hardly may contend against a breath,  They dwelt in burrows of their unsunned caves.  Neither of winter's cold had they fixed sign,  Nor of the spring when she comes decked with flowers,  Nor yet of summer's heat with melting fruits  Sure token: but utterly without knowledge  Moiled, until I the rising of the stars  Showed them, and when they set, though much obscure.  Moreover, number, the most excellent  Of all inventions, I for them devised,  And gave them writing that retaineth all,  The serviceable mother of the Muse.  I was the first that yoked unmanaged beasts,  To serve as slaves with collar and with pack,  And take upon themselves, to man's relief,  The heaviest labour of his hands: and  Tamed to the rein and drove in wheeled cars  The horse, of sumptuous pride the ornament.  And those sea-wanderers with the wings of cloth,  The shipman's waggons, none but I contrived.  These manifold inventions for mankind  I perfected, who, out upon't, have none-  No, not one shift-to rid me of this shame.<br />  CHORUS  Thy sufferings have been shameful, and thy mind  Strays at a loss: like to a bad physician  Fallen sick, thou'rt out of heart: nor cans't prescribe  For thine own case the draught to make thee sound.<br />  PROMETHEUS  But hear the sequel and the more admire  What arts, what aids I cleverly evolved.  The chiefest that, if any man fell sick,  There was no help for him, comestible,  Lotion or potion; but for lack of drugs  They dwindled quite away; until I taught them  To compound draughts and mixtures sanative,  Wherewith they now are armed against disease.  I staked the winding path of divination  And was the first distinguisher of dreams,  The true from false; and voices ominous  Of meaning dark interpreted; and tokens  Seen when men take the road; and augury  By flight of all the greater crook-clawed birds  With nice discrimination I defined;  These by their nature fair and favourable,  Those, flattered with fair name. And of each sort  The habits I described; their mutual feuds  And friendships and the assemblages they hold.  And of the plumpness of the inward partsI risked the bord attempt, and saved mankind                           From stark destruction and the road to hell.                           Therefore with this sore penance am I bowed,                           Grievous to suffer, pitiful to see.                           But, for compassion shown to man, such fate                           I no wise earned; rather in wrath's despite                           Am I to be reformed, and made a show                           Of infamy to Zeus. <br />Later he explains just what the possession of knowledge will mean to mankind: <br />                      PROMETHEUS                           Think not that I for pride and stubbornness                           Am silent: rather is my heart the prey                           Of gnawing thoughts, both for the past, and now                           Seeing myself by vengeance buffeted.

One of the things you can assume when you write about Shakespeare--given the hundreds of thousands of pages that have already been written about him in countless books, essays, theses and term papers--is that whatever you say will have been said before, and then denounced, defended , revised and denounced again, ad infinitum.  So I'm certain I'm not breaking any new ground here.  King Lear, though many, including David Denby (see Orrin's review of Great Books) and Harold Bloom consider it the pinnacle of English Literature,  has just never done much for me.  I appreciate the power of the basic plot--an aging King divides his realm among his ungrateful children with disastrous results--which has resurfaced in works as varied as Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, A Thousand Acres (see Orrin's review), and Akira Kurosawa's last great film, Ran.  But I've always found the play to be too busy, the characters to be too unsympathetic, the speeches to be unmemorable and the tragedy to be too shallow.  By shallow, I mean that by the time we meet Lear he is already a petulant old man, we have to accept his greatness from the word of others.  Then his first action in the play, the division of the kingdom, is so boneheaded and his reaction to Cordelia so selfishly blind, that we're unwilling to credit their word.<br />Then there's the fact that Shakespeare essentially uses the action of the play as a springboard for an examination of madness.  The play was written during the period when Shakespeare was experimenting with obscure meanings anyway; add in the demented babble of several of the central characters, including Lear, and you've got a drama whose language is just about impossible to follow.  Plus you've got seemingly random occurrences like the disappearance of the Fool and Edgar's pretending to help his father commit suicide.  I am as enamored of the Bard as anyone, but it's just too much work for an author to ask of his audience trying to figure out what the heck they are all saying and what their actions are supposed to convey.  So I long ago gave up trying to decipher the whole thing and I simply group it with the series of non-tragic tragedies (along with MacBeth, Hamlet, Julius Caesar), which I think taken together can be considered to make a unified political statement about the importance of the regular transfer of power in a state.  Think about it for a moment; there's no real tragedy in what happens to Caesar, MacBeth, Hamlet or Lear; they've all proven themselves unfit for rule.  Nor are the fates of those who usurp power from Caesar, Hamlet and Lear at all tragic, with the possible exception of Brutus, they pretty much get what they have coming to them.  Instead, the real tragedy lies in the bloody chain of events that each illegitimate claiming of power unleashes.  The implied message of these works, when considered as a unified whole, is that deviance from the orderly transfer of power leads to disaster for all concerned.  (Of particular significance to this analysis in regards to King Lear is the fact that it was written in 1605, the year of the Gunpowder Plot.)<br />In fact, looking at Lear from this perspective offers some potential insight into several aspects of the play that have always bothered me.  For instance, take the rapidity with which Lear slides into insanity.  This transition has never made much sense to me.  But now suppose that Lear is insane before the action of the play begins and that the clearest expression of his loss of reason is his decision to shatter his own kingdom.  Seen in this light, there is no precipitous decline into madness; the very act of splitting up the central authority of his throne, of transferring power improperly, is shown to be a sign of craziness.<br />Next, consider the significance of Edgar's pretense of insanity and of Lear's genuine dementia.  What is the possible meaning of their wanderings and their reduction to the status of common fools, stripped of luxuryand station? And what does it tell us that it is after they are so reduced that Lear's reason (i.e. his fitness to rule) is restored and that Edgar ultimately takes the throne.  It is probably too much to impute this meaning to Shakespeare, but the text will certainly bear the interpretation that they are made fit to rule by gaining an understanding of the lives of common folk.  This is too democratic a reading for the time, but I like it, and it is emblematic of Shakespeare's genius that his plays will withstand even such idiosyncratic interpretations.<br />To me, the real saving grace of the play lies not in the portrayal of the fathers, Lear and Gloucester, nor of the daughters, but rather in that of the sons.  First, Edmund, who ranks with Richard III and Iago in sheer joyous malevolence.  Second, Edgar, whose ultimate ascent to the throne makes all that has gone before worthwhile.  He strikes me as one of the truly heroic characters in all of Shakespeare, as exemplified by his loyalty to his father and to the King.  I've said I don't consider the play to be particularly tragic; in good part this is because it seems the nation is better off with Edgar on the throne than with Lear or one of his vile daughters.<br />Even a disappointing, and often bewildering, tragedy by Shakespeare is better than the best of many other authors (though I'd not say the same of his comedies.)  So of course I recommend it, but I don't think as highly of it as do many of the critics.<br />GRADE : B-uxury and station?

I don't belong to the Platonic  tradition, I belong to the Socratic tradition.  -John Ralston Saul<br />John Ralston Saul, one of Canada's leading political philosophers,  has drawn an apt analogy in comparing himself to Socrates, but pointedly not to Plato, because he offers a great insight (which is essentially liberal in nature) into the Modern condition, but his personal political predilections (which are essentially Liberal in nature) blind him to the implications. Thus, he is an amusing gadfly, puncturing many myths and prejudices, but he backs off of several cows that are sacred to him, unwilling to apply the rigor of his own argument, and he presents no general program or solution to the problems he perceptively delineates, perhaps because such a program would jibe so closely with the conservative agenda.<br />Saul's essential insight is that Reason has replaced Religion as the central organizing principle for human affairs, but that Reason, which is essentially just a competing set of beliefs, is extremely dangerous because it has no inherent moral structure. The danger, and this is the most compelling part of Saul's argument, is that rational elites (bureaucrats) have risen up as a modern priesthood; acting as if they are blessed with some special sacred knowledge, they impose rules and regulations on the rest of us to try to make reality fit their technocratic vision.  This social engineering inevitably leads to the repression of human freedoms, but at it's worst, can also lead to outright tyranny and state violence (i.e., Communism, Nazism).<br />So far so good. But from there on, Mr. Saul goes badly astray, seemingly unable to face the fact that his is a conservative critique of the Modern World.  He ends up flying off into nonsensical diatribes against free marketeers and advocates of globalization, as if these apostles of freedom were the fundamental threat to liberty.  What is the better alternative to the Free Market, if you oppose having elites impose their ideas?  He offers none (perhaps because there is none).  Meanwhile, forgotten are the bureaucrats, technocrats and the Social Welfare State itself, which should be the real targets of his righteous anger.<br />His other big bugaboo is what he calls Corporatism--the tendency of voters to act as members of blocks rather than as individuals.  But he mistakenly believes that they are voting as members of Large Multinational corporations; in fact, the real problem is that Union members, Blacks, Jews, etc. reflexively vote Democrat in overwhelming percentages.  There are no comparable conservative voting blocks, except perhaps for conservative Christians.  One wishes that every employee of a multinational did vote for free market solutions, lower taxes, etc.  But obviously this is not the case.  Once again, Saul has lit out after a straw man.<br />As he goes along, Saul continually repeats this pattern, bang on the mark on many issues (particularly his criticisms of  Freud, specialization, the modern university, economists, pursuit of happiness, etc.), then failing to apply his own logic on other issues (inexplicably he supports public schools, adopts Galbreath's opposition to the Growth Economy [read Orrin's review of The Affluent Society by Galbreath], etc.)  It's like reading a book by Harvey &quot;Two Face&quot; Dent as cogent analysis alternates dizzyingly with purblind defense of liberal canards and gratuitous attacks on his natural allies.<br />The end result is that Saul emerges as a kind of idiot savant; on the big issue--the triumph of Reason over Religion--he has had a significant, though unoriginal, insight, but frequently when it comes time to spin out the implications of his epiphany, he stumbles badly.  And there are virtually no policy prescriptions here, other than that we should cultivate doubt (no duh!, one of the 20th century's conservative icons, Karl Popper, explained that the essence of Scientific Thought is the maintenance of doubt) and that people should be given time off from work to participate in civic affairs (during which time they would universally head for golf courses or bars).  These conclusions are so heavily indebted to others, on the one hand, and so feeble, on the other, as not to deserve being taken seriously.  Saul, like the libertarians whom he obviously resents resembling (see Orrin's review of The Future and It's Enemies by Virginia Postrel), is strong on the critique, but weak on the constructive, as anyone who opposes the omposition of faux expertise must be..<br />Saul has some interesting things to say and, simply by virtue of the virulence of his polemic, he is often quite amusing, but, because of the dichotomy between his insight and its application,  these books, which overlap one another extensively, can basically be graded in descending order of the length of their argument.  Voltaire's Bastards, weighing in at 600  pages, is so long that the weaknesses in his argument become obvious and they have time to become tedious.  Unconscious Civilization is  based on a series of lectures and is short enough that the problems are less evident.  Far and away, the best of the three is Doubters Companion, although it is somewhat dependent on the other two.

The  sustaining myth of the Soviet Union and fellow travelers in the West had been that Stalin took a noble  and righteous revolution and perverted it to his own ends, that Marxism would have worked, but for  this artificial intervention by one monstrous man.  The truth was quite different, that the Revolution  was corrupt from it's inception, that Lenin and the Bolsheviks stole the Revolution from more popular  and democratic Left parties, and that Lenin and the Soviets ruled through terror from the start.  Once  this final prop was kicked out from under the Soviet Union, it quickly collapsed.<br />Comes now Carlos Fuentes, the Marxist novelist of Mexico, to argue that the Mexican Revolution was  likewise pristine and honorable until it was corrupted by faithless leaders and corrupt one-party rule.  In fact, this long (excruciatingly so) epic novel seeks to go back and revisit many such arguments from  the 20th Century.  It is quite audacious--he is after all trying to say, at the end of a Century that was  decisively won by the forces of liberal democratic capitalism,, that the Socialist/Marxist Left was  generally right about most issues--but it is neither convincing as history nor compelling reading.<br />The story is ostensibly about the life of a famous photographer, Laura Diaz, as retold by her grandson  who, at the start of the novel, recognizes her as one of the figures in a Diego Rivera mural.  Fuentes  charts her life through several marriages, numerous love affairs, various personal tragedies, and her  late development into a respected artist.  But all of this is juxtaposed against the events of the Century.  In what quickly becomes a noticeable annoying contrivance, the main events of her life just happen to  occur at the precise moments in history which the author wishes to comment upon--her life is really  secondary to the march of world events.  The problem with this is that, since the author obviously is  less interested in her than in what's going on around her, it is hard for him to get us to care about her.  Why should we care more than he does ?<br />If you'll indulge me for a moment, I think I've discerned a pivotal structural flaw in the novel, though  I admit I've not thought it out fully.  It seems to me that most multi-generational historical epics like  this don't merely pin themselves to one character and a batch of events, instead they are generally  driven by a discrete set of events with a known conclusion (Winds of War comes to mind) or the  central character/characters are trying to build or defend some family enterprise (Scarlett O'Hara had  Tara, and in Tai-Pan, Dirk Struan had the Noble House).  In the absence of such coherence imposing  structures, the main character has to be incredibly interesting in order to keep our attention for  hundreds and hundreds of pages and nearly a hundred years.  Laura Diaz is simply not such a  character.<br />Now that is a significant weakness, but it's not fatal.  Other authors have written great epic novels  without one overwhelmingly interesting character : consider War and Peace.  But if you don't have  such a character for us to identify with and root for (or against), you had better have a sure hand on  the tiller of events.  It's here that Fuentes fails miserably.  To take just one example, a major portion  of the story features the community of Hollywood refuges from McCarthyism living in Mexico in the  1950's.  Fuentes argues correctly that McCarthy was a demagogue run amok, smearing people for his  own political reasons, rather than on the basis of evidence or out of any moral sense of right and  wrong.  But he then proceeds to excuse American Communists and to himself smear anti-Communism  generally.<br />At various points--in complete opposition to conclusive evidence that has cometo light since the end  of the Cold War--he maintains that the Rosenbergs were innocent, that Communist writers, directors  and actors were not following orders from the central Party, that there was no basis for the  anti-Communist movement, etc.  At one point he says that :<br />  The day will come when all the accused will be rehabilitated and celebrated as cultural heroes,  and the accusers will be the accused and degraded just as they deserve.<br />In fact, at the end of the Cold War, who are the honored heroes ?  Elia Kazan received a special Oscar  for Lifetime Achievement.  Whittaker Chambers received a posthumous Medal of Freedom from  Ronald Reagan and was the subject of a major reassessment by Sam Tannenhaus.  Even his journalism  and reputation as a writer has been revived and rehabilitated; by any measure, his memoir, Witness,  must be considered one of the major texts of the century.<br />And what of the unrepentant Party members who refused to testify ?  Alger Hiss, like the Rosenbergs,  lies, unmourned, in a traitor's grave.  Despite the continuing bouquets from the modern Left, the once  towering reputations of Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman are in tatters.  The repellent pair  having been exposed as doctrinaire Stalinsts, unswayed even by genocide.  Take a look at books like  Hollywood Party: How Communism Seduced the American Film Industry in the 1930s  and 1940s  (1998)(Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley),  Not Without Honor : The History of American Anticommunism  by Richard Gid Powers,  Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case by Allen Weinstein, The Haunted Wood :  Soviet Espionage in America- -The Stalin Era by Allen Weinstein, The Soviet World of American  Communism (Annals of Communism) by John Haynes , Venona : Decoding Soviet Espionage in  America by John Earl Haynes,  and try to make an honest argument that the victims of McCarthyism  were innocents.  No, the tragedy of Joe McCarthy is not that the witch hunt was unwarranted, but that  he was too irresponsible to lead it--not that lives were ruined, but that some of the wrong lives may  have been ruined.  There was in fact a Communist conspiracy to subvert American democracy; it was  financed and directed from Moscow; and those who refused to testify before Congressional committees  were aiding and abetting a foreign power.<br />Perhaps more disturbing, and indicative of how oblivious Mr. Fuentes is to the true historical record is  the absurd distinction that he repeatedly makes between Hitler and Stalin.  He continues to maintain  what one would have hoped would by now be an indefensible canard, that though both used evil  means, Stalin at least had good intentions because communism was intended to help the workers, but  that Hitler represented genuine evil because his ends were evil.<br />  Nazis and Communists are not the same thing.  The difference is that Hitler believes in evil, evil is  his gospel--conquest, genocide, racism.  But Stalin must say he believes in the good, in the freedom  of labor, in the disappearance of the state, and in giving to each according to his needs.  He recites  the gospel of the civil good.<br />First of all, this ignores the inconvenient fact that Hitler was just as serious about Socialism as he was  about racism.  Second, it ignores the by now nearly incontrovertible argument that mass movements  like Nazism and Communism have far more in common than they do that divides them.  The work of  authors like Eric Hoffer, F. A. Hayek, Paul Johnson, Allan Bullock, Robert Conquest, and a host of  others should really have settled this issue.  These movements are, by and large, driven by intellectuals  who think that they know better than the masses how to run a country, adopt a nearly religious belief  structure to justify their actions, and then unleash the destructive forces of followers who don't  particularly care what the new system may bring, but know that they are losers in the current system.  It is inevitable that such revolutions end in violence and repression, as every single one we've ever  witnessed has in fact done.  Finally, it assumes that ideal Communism is necessarily a good.  The idea  that a system based on oppressing one man to benefit another is de facto a good thing, is hardly a  given, and, I would argue, is actually evil itself (see Orrin's review of The Communist Manifesto.)<br />Which brings us to the Mexican Revolution, whose initial urges Fuentes works so hard to vindicate.  In  particular, he seems awestruck by the emphasis on worker rights, the six day work week, and the eight  hour work day.  I don't know enough about Mexican history to know whether this was truly the great  focus of the Revolution (Fuentes tends to make the unfortunate assumption that we are as obsessed  with Mexico and conversant with it's history as he is with us and ours), but let's accept Fuentes's  insistence that this is what made it worthwhile.  Elevation of these basic tenets to nearly sacred status  requires one of two things : either they must be invested with some kind of absolute semi-talismanic  level, must take on the quality of nearly religious commandments; or they are subject to being trumped  repeatedly.

Dillon finds himself on the horns of an appalling moral  dilemma : do as the terrorists say and blow up dozens of friends, coworkers and other innocents; or  alert the police and risk getting his unloved wife killed.  His eventual choice sets in motion a chain of  events which will require subsequent, intertwining moral choices and which can not end happily.<br />In a century which gave us a near infinitude of horrifying statements and sentiments, I've always found  the following, from E. M. Forster, to be the most disturbing :<br />  If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the  guts to betray my country.<br />The monstrous selfishness of this remark, gussied up in the guise of loyalty, is a fitting epitaph for an  era that lionized the Hollywood Ten and vilified Linda Tripp.  All too few authors and other  intellectuals were willing to seriously question the full implications of such an attitude; Brian Moore is  the exception.  Combining elements of everything from The Desperate Hours to The Informer to The  Heart of the Matter, Moore explores a series of moral questions, and manages to do so in the midst of  a compulsively readable thriller.<br />One of the most insipid canards going, accepted even by conservatives who should know better, is that  the Left produces all of the great literature.  As we look back on the 20th Century, it seems  increasingly evident that it is the small group of writers on the Right, many of them Catholic, who  actually produced the Century's most important and enduring body of work, among them : T. S. Eliot;  George Orwell; Evelyn Waugh; J.R.R. Tolkein; C. S. Lewis; Flannery O'Connor; Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn; Andre Dubus; Frederick Buechner; Tom Wolfe; and Brian Moore.  (Even Graham  Greene, who--when both were alive--referred to Moore as his &quot;favorite living writer,&quot; was at his  unintentional best in books like Heart of the Matter and End of the Affair, where he did not even  realize that he was writing from a conservative viewpoint.)  If you've never read anything by Brian  Moore, truly one of the most underrated and unread great authors of recent years, Lies of Silence is as  good a place to start as any.<br />GRADE: Als were willing to seriously question the full implications of such an attitude; Brian Moore is  the exception.

The most familiar are the  Mowgli tales, basis for the very good Disney movie.  Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the  jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family.  Bagheera (the black panther) places him with a  wolf family that has a newborn litter.  Mowgli's new &quot;parents&quot; and Bagheera and Baloo (the brown  bear) sponsor him for membership in the Wolf Pack and, much to Shere Khan's chagrin, he is  admitted.  Mowgli is raised according to Jungle Law, but all the while Shere Khan is plotting his  revenge and ingratiating himself with the younger wolves.  Eventually, he leads a rebellion against  Akela, the pack's aging leader and attacks Mowgli, who beats him away with a burning firebrand.  In  these and the several other Mowgli stories--there are some prequels--Kipling strikes a nice balance  between anthropomorphizing the animals and understanding Mowgli's natural superiority.<br />Also appearing in this collection is a story I've loved since I first saw the Classic Cartoon  version--Rikki Tikki Tavi.  It tells the story of an intrepid young mongoose and his life or death battle  to protect an Indian villa from a couple of particularly unpleasant cobras.  Rikki Tikki Tavi has always  seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature.<br />These are great stories for young and old.  For folks who worry about Kipling's potentially imperialist,  racist or racialist overtones (see review), rest assured, these tales are free of such themes.  They offer  an excellent opportunity to introduce kids to the work of a true master storyteller.<br />GRADE: A	2000-11-18

Our  disbelief is an inevitable outgrowth of increased scientific understanding of the world around us,  particularly in the realms of Physics and Evolutionary theory.  It is a predictable corollary of the  individualistic political and economic doctrines we have adopted with such success.  And to a little  appreciated degree, it is a function of the material comfort that we enjoy.  Taken together, all of these  factors have removed ignorance, superstition, subservience and desperation as reasons to believe in  religion.  Since Reason would require proof of God's existence, which it is probably impossible to  provide, all that's really left is simple faith and, from what we've seen this past century, faith is not  enough.  There is much that is good about this liberation, the freeing of man from God, but there are  also some terrible consequences.  The most important consequence is the removal of metaphysical  standards of Right and Wrong, of Truth and Beauty, and the resulting disastrous slide into moral  relativity.  The other main consequence is the sort of inchoate longing that, even if you haven't  experienced it personally, is so readily apparent in things like the Psychiatric, Environmental, New  Age and Wicca movements.  Absent God and his laws, what is there to give our lives meaning and  direction?  What are we doing here?  Do we have a purpose or are we, individually and as a species, as  insignificant as science has made us seem?  The difficulty of answering those questions lies at the heart  of the soul sickness that human society suffers.  This inability to attach meaning or value to ourselves  and our actions has left an enormous void at the core of our beings and, thus far, science has offered us  nothing to fill the vacuum.<br />Given the tremendous difficulty that even we have reconciling our skepticism with our desire for  certitude, separated as we are by two thousand years from the Biblical age, imagine how much more  difficult it would have been to struggle against belief if you were a contemporary who witnessed the  living Christ and encountered evidence of his miracles.  Imagine further that you are not just any man,  but are actually the criminal who was spared from the cross when the mob was offered the choice of  setting Jesus or one of his fellow prisoners free, that the innocent Christ quite literally died for your  sins.  This is what Par Lagerqvist has done in this beautiful and moving novel.  Barabbas is set free but  not before seeing the luminescent figure of Christ and hearing him plead that Barabbas be spared and  not himself.  Barabbas then feels compelled to follow Christ to Golgotha, where he witnesses the  Crucifixion and sees the darkness fall as Christ dies.  Through the rest of his life, Barabbas's path  intersects with the disciples and followers of Christ.  Always he resists their belief--how after all can  one believe in a Savior who allows himself to be crucified--but looks for some irrefutable proof from  them that Jesus was the Messiah. His ambivalence comes to represented on a medallion that he wears.  On the front it says that he is property of the Roman State--it is placed on him while he is enslaved in  the mines--but he has a Christian acolyte scratch the symbols on the back that show him to be a  follower of Christ.  Still later he scratches this out.  Ultimately, while living in Rome, he hears rumors  that the Christians have set the city aflame and, taking up a burning brand, he proceeds to start the  fires that he hopes will signal the return of the Messiah.  In the final scene, he is crucified along with  Peter and the other Christians accused of arson:<br />  When he felt death approaching, that which he had always been so afraid of, he said out loud into  the darkness, as though he were speaking to it:<br />  --To thee I deliver up my soul.<br />  And then he gave up the ghost.<br />These lines concisely capture the human dilemma.  The darkness reappears, recall it descended as  Christ died, and Barabbas calls out &quot;as if&quot; he were speaking to it.  Does his addressing the darkness  mean that in the end he believes it is God?  Or does the &quot;as if&quot; imply that he dies doubting?  And  though he delivers his soul, he gives up the ghost--is he in fact imbued with a divine spark which he  can surrender to God?<br />I found the following story in a sermon online :<br />  Par Lagerkvist, in his short story, My Father and I, tells of an experience he had as a small boy  when he and his father went for a walk one Sunday afternoon. It was a beautiful day when their  walk began, but suddenly night came and they were engulfed in darkness. In order to find their  way home, they followed the familiar railroad tracks. The boy was filled with great fear at the  encroaching darkness, though the father walked calmly along. The boy tried to walk closer to his  father. He confesses to his father that the darkness is terrifying him and the father replies:<br />  &quot;'No, my boy, it's not horrible,' he said, taking me by the hand.<br />  'Yes, father, it is.'<br />  'No, my child, you mustn't think that. Not when we know there is a God.'<br />  I felt so lonely, forsaken. It was so strange that only I was afraid, not father, that we didn't think  the same. And strange that what he had said didn't help me and stop me from being afraid. Not  even what he said about God helped me. ... We walked in silence, each with his own thoughts. My  heart contracted, as though the darkness had got in and was beginning to squeeze it.<br />  Then, as we were rounding a bend, we suddenly heard a mighty roar behind us! We were  awakened out of our thoughts and alarmed. Father pulled me down onto the embankment, down  into the abyss, held me there. Then the train tore past, a black train. All the lights in the carriages  were out, and it was going at frantic speed. What sort of train was it? There wasn't one due now!  We gazed at it in terror. The fire blazed in the huge engine ... sparks whirled out into the night. It  was terrible. The driver stood there in the light of the fire, pale, motionless, his features as though  turned to stone. Father didn't recognize him, ... the man just stared straight ahead, as though intent  only on rushing into the darkness, far into the darkness that had no end.<br />  .... I stood there panting, gazing after the furious vision. It was swallowed up by the night. Father  took me onto the line; we hurried home. He said, 'Strange, what train was that? And I didn't  recognize the driver.' Then we walked on in silence.<br />  My whole body was shaking. It was for me, for my sake. I sensed what it meant: it was the  anguish that was to come, the unknown, all that father knew nothing about, that he wouldn't be  able to protect me against. That was how this world, this life, would be for me; not like father's  where everything was secure and certain. It wasn't a real world, a real life. It just hurdled, blazing,  into the darkness ahead.&quot; (Par Lagerkvist, &quot;My Father and I,&quot; The Marriage Feast,  1954)<br />This story relates to Barabbas in a couple of illuminating ways.

Rowling's Harry Potter books (see Orrin's review)--the first two are  currently both in the Top 10 of most Bestseller Lists--lead me to reread this Children's Classic, which  was one of the big favorites of our generation.  I must have read it around fifth grade--I imagine most  every kid in America reads it at some point--and no one will be surprised to hear, it turns out I wasn't  as smart as I thought I was when I was ten.  Madeleine L'Engle managed to hoodwink me, but good.  I thought this was just a great Science Fiction/Fantasy story, but now I discover that the whole book is  a religious allegory.<br />Meg Murry and her brothers, Charles Wallace and the twins, live with their mother.  Their Father has  been missing for years, supposedly working on a top secret government project.  Meg and Charles  Wallace are strange children, noone seems to know quite whether they are idiots or geniuses.  In short  order they meet Calvin, a tall gangly boy, who also feels like a misfit and three women who have  moved into an abandoned house in the neighborhood.  The old women, Mrs. Whatsit , Mrs. Which &amp;  Mrs. Who, inform the children that Mr. Murry is in dire straits and needs their help.  They travel  through time and space via wrinkles, called tesseracts, to the planet Camazotz, where Mr. Murry has  gone to battle the forces of darkness that are closing sections of the universe in shadow.  There they  battle the evil being known as IT, a disembodied brain who offers people complete security if they  will only give up their freedom and their individuality, as have the inhabitants of Camazotz.<br />Most of the allegorical stuff is easy enough to see, the children can fight evil by finding The Father.  Meg despairs that evil is allowed to exist at all and blames her father, and so on.  But I really liked the  fact that L'Engle portrays Camazotz (or Hell) as a place where there is complete conformity and  security, but no personal freedom.  Personally, I believe that Camazotz closely resembles both a  Socialist or Communist State and the Garden of Eden. Just as the great struggle of Ms L &quot;Engle's time  was the fight for freedom against the security of Socialism/Communism, Man chose to leave the  security of a pastoral existence in the Garden and accept the vicissitudes of life without because we  prefer freedom.<br />The book also contains one of the most beautiful descriptions of human life that I've ever heard.  Mrs.  Whatsit compares life to a sonnet:<br />  It is a very strict form of poetry is it not?<br />  There are fourteen lines, I believe, all in iambic pentameter.  That's a very strict rhythm or meter,  yes?<br />  And each line has to end with a rigid rhyme pattern.  And if the poet does not do it exactly this  way,  it is not a sonnet, is it?<br />  Calvin:  You mean you're comparing our lives to a sonnet?  A strict form, but freedom within it?<br />  Yes.  You're given the form, but you have to write the sonnet yourself.  What you say is  completely up to you.<br />This book conveys a worthwhile religiopolitical lesson about the human condition and is great fun  besides.

And is forgotten.  -Waiting for Godot<br />  The American director Alan Schneider first met the Irish playwright Samuel Beckett in 1955, after  being hired to direct the United States premiere of ''Waiting for Godot'' in Miami. Schneider had  come to Beckett's Paris apartment bursting with preproduction questions, especially regarding the  identity of the title character. To Schneider's initial query, ''Who is Godot?,'' the laconic playwright  famously replied, ''If I knew, I would have said so in the play.''<br />  Henceforth, Schneider was to devote most of his career to realizing Beckett's stated intentions in his  plays. But despite his fidelity to every letter of Beckett's text, and despite the participation of such  popular clowns as Bert Lahr and Tom Ewell, the Miami production of ''Waiting for Godot'' was a  resounding flop. Baffled by the metaphysical reverberations of a work that had been billed as ''the  laugh riot of two continents,'' a third of the audience left at intermission. Others lined up at the box  office not to purchase tickets but to ask for refunds.  -from Robert Brustein's NY Times review of The Correspondence of Samuel Beckett and  Alan Schneider<br />To read Waiting for Godot is to bitterly envy those lucky folks who actually had the privilege of  walking out and demanding their money back.  In a more just world they would have hunted down the  playwright and horsewhipped him.<br />Here is the play in its entirety:  Two tramps, Vladimir and Estragon, wait by a tree for two days,  expecting the imminent appearance of Godot.  Instead they are visited by a master and slave, Pozzo  and Lucky, and a boy who brings them a message that Godot will soon be there. The curtain falls.  The crowd hisses.<br />That's it.  Godot is obviously supposed to be God (though Beckett relentless fought against others  finding meaning in the work) and the play presumably demonstrates the futility of human existence:  waiting around for the God who never shows.  Of course, this message is nothing new.  In fact, it is  central to the story of Christ.  When he was being crucified, Jesus wailed: &quot;Oh Lord, why hast thou  forsaken me?&quot;  It is in this moment that God/Christ came to understand man's despair and Christ then  admonished: &quot;Forgive them Lord, they know not what they do.&quot;  So 2000 years ago, it was said better  in a far superior drama; why sit through this piece of crap?<br />One delightful irony that I found is that Beckett was adamant that production of this play--which is  supposed to show the folly of existence, the impossibility of communication, etc.--follow the strict  guidelines that he envisioned:<br />  In his autobiography, the American director Alan Schneider recalled his attendance with Samuel  Beckett at the first run of Waiting for Godot in London in 1955. Whenever a line was  misinterpreted or an extra piece of stage business was added, Beckett would clutch Schneider's arm  and exclaim, in a clearly audible stage whisper, &quot;It's ahl wrahng! He's doing it ahl wrahng!&quot;1 That  loud whisper still sounds in the ears of those who stage Beckett's plays now.  No other dead  dramatist remains such a daunting admonitory presence for his directors and performers. Where  most great playwrights were content to write the text of a play, Beckett wrote the entire theatrical  event. He specified, not just the words, but the rhythms and tones, the sets and the lighting plots,  and these specifications are preserved in the remarkable series of notebooks whose publication by  Faber and Faber is now completed with S.E. Gontarski's exemplary edition of Beckett's ledgers for  productions of his short late plays.<br />  Where most plays invite the active participation of actors, directors, and designers in determining  the meaning of the work, Beckett's work demands that the meaning remains indeterminate. Where  theater artists think of themselves as interpreters, any interpretation of a Beckett play is necessarily a  reduction. With these plays, creative intervention seems like crass interference. The director is  haunted by the playwright's stern ghost, frowning, clutching his arm, whispering at every deviation,  &quot;It's ahl wrahng!&quot;  -from Game Without End by Fintan O'Toole (NY Review of Books)<br />I mean that's just beautiful.  Life is pointless, but it's my way or the highway.  You've gotta love it.  These poor existentialists have such a hard time keeping their story straight, you can sometimes almost  feel sorry for them.<br />I took a Humanities class in High School and absolutely loathed it (some of you may recall my  discussion of Ragtime which a teacher suggested I read for the class--see Review).  This was one of the  things we read and even as a callow youth of 15 or 16, I was flabbergasted at what a crock it was.

It is tragic in the sense that it made their own lives miserable, but also  in that someone like Camus used his genius to propound a philosophy that is enormously dangerous in  the hands of men who are, unfortunately, not as decent as the author.  The danger, as Dostoevsky said  in The Brothers Karamazov, is that: If there is no God, everything is permitted.  Try as he might, and  I believe that his career was essentially one long attempt to do so, Camus was never able to disprove  this dictum.<br />Camus begins his essay by stating the proposition that:<br />  There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.  Judging whether life is or  is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.<br />This indeed is the essence of Existentialism when turned inward upon the self; if there is no point nor  purpose to our existence, then why should we continue?  Now if it should turn out that there is no  good answer to this question, there's not much danger to the rest of us, existentialists can all just kill  themselves.  But there's a more insidious corollary to this question, one that arises when you turn  Existentialism outward upon others : if human life is purposeless, isn't it also valueless?  And if human  lives have no value then what reasonable basis is there for morality?  Why should we refrain from  killing each other?  Camus unceasingly sought to answer these questions, but, given existential  assumptions, his answers are necessarily feeble and therein lies the danger.  A philosophy that relies on  the inherent goodness of man's nature, and fails to posit absolute laws of behavior, is completely  inadequate.  And the absolute, by it's very nature, assumes something--some being, some power, some  law--external to man.  If man is the measure of himself, then everything is relative and anything goes.<br />Existentialism though, does not merely require that it's adherents deny the possibility of the divine, it  also requires them to deny reality, by failing to acknowledge human progress.  The famous eponymous  metaphor that Camus uses to explain existence is the myth of Sisyphus.  Like his better known  compatriots Atlas and Prometheus, Sisyphus challenged the gods of Greek mythology and for his  temerity was sentenced to push a huge boulder up a hill every day and every day as he reached the top,  it would roll back down.  Camus draws a parallel here to the human condition, that we, like Sisyphus,  toil away at senseless and ultimately futile tasks.  But to believe that this is true, one must willfully  ignore the enormous strides that we have made as a species in the realms of science, medicine, and  social justice.  Though our lives may seem at times to be as difficult and unproductive as Camus  maintains, at the end of each day we've moved that boulder a little further, and though some slippage  does occur, even the most pessimistic among us would have to concede that it's pretty far up the hill at  this point and shows virtually no likelihood of ever rolling back to the bottom.  In fact, it even seems  possible that the summit is in sight.<br />It may be that Camus was simply a victim of time and place; being French and living through two  World Wars would be enough to whip the optimism out of most anybody.  It's probably hard to be too  upbeat when you spend all your time with one ear cocked, listening for the roar of German guns  coming to pummel your nation into submission, again.  We, on the other hand, certainly live in a time  when it is easy to be optimistic--everything from the cosmos to the genetic code seems to be yielding  to our inquiries these days.  But it is important not to let Camus off the hook quite that easily.  Like  Orwell, he should be remembered as a man of great moral courage, character and intellectual honesty,  one of the key figures (post Darwin, post Freud, post Nietszche) in trying to preserve ethical standards  of conduct for Man in the absence of God.  But it should also be recalled that had his philosophy  prevailed, enormous harm would have resulted.  For the ultimate, inevitable result of his philosophy is  to destroy the foundation upon which moral standards must be built. The Myth of Sisyphus is an  admirable attempt to rebuild those foundations, but it's real significance lies in it's very failure to do  so.  Existentialism, which starts out by denying God, ends by denying Man, and is, therefore,  anti-human.<br />GRADE: B-onesty,  one of the key figures (post Darwin, post Freud, post Nietszche) in trying to preserve ethical standards  of conduct for Man in the absence of God.

Influenced by American  hard-boiled fiction and film noir, it tells the deceptively simple story of a young French Algerian  named Meursault.  As the novel opens he announces, in one of the best known opening lines in all of  literature: &quot;Maman died today.&quot;  (In the most widely read previous English language version, by the  great translator Stuart Gilbert, the line was rendered: &quot;Mother died today.&quot;)  Meursault travels to the  nursing home where she is to be buried, but mystifies the staff and his mother's friends by his failure  to react emotionally to her death.  He does not cry, does not ask to view the body and leaves  immediately after she is buried.  At the close of the day he observes:<br />  It occurred to me that anyway one more Sunday was over, that Maman was buried now, that I was  going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed.<br />This establishes him as an Existential hero, someone who recognizes the futility of human existence,  but continues on even in the face of it's fundamental absurdity.<br />In the ensuing days he interacts with the other tenants of his building, including Raymond Sintes, a  pimp, and with his coworkers, including Marie Cardona, actually a former coworker with whom he  starts having an affair.  He further demonstrates his indifference to mundane concerns in a couple of  episodes.  He angers his boss by not responding with sufficient enthusiasm to a promotion:<br />  'You're young, and it seems to me it's the kind of life that would appeal to you.'  I said yes but that  really it was all the same to me.  Then he asked me if I wasn't interested in a change of life.  I said  that people never change their lives, that in any case one life was as good as another and that I  wasn't dissatisfied with mine here at all.  He looked upset and told me that I never gave him a  straight answer, that I had no ambition, and that this was disastrous in business.  So I went back to  work.  I would rather not have upset him, but I couldn't see any reason to change my life.  Looking  back on it, I wasn't unhappy.  When I was a student, I had lots of ambitions like that.  But when I  had to give up my studies I learned very quickly that none of it really mattered.<br />And when Marie asks him if he wants to marry her:<br />  I said it didn't make any difference to me and that we could if she wanted to.  Then she wanted to  know if I loved her.  I answered the same way I had the last time, that it didn't mean anything but  that I probably didn't love her.<br />Eventually he gets drawn into a violent dispute between Sintes and a gang of Arabs.  There is a knife  fight on the beach one day and Meursault ends up with a gun.  Later, walking by himself on the beach,  he meets up with one of the Arabs and shoots him, then shoots him four more times after he's fallen to  the sand.<br />In the second half of the novel he is put on trial for murder.  Everyone from his own attorney to the  judge is mystified, even horrified by Meursault's indifference to his own actions and to the proceedings  which will determine his fate.  During the prosecutor's summation, Meursault reflects:<br />  I was listening, and I could hear that I was being judged intelligent.  But I couldn't quite understand  how an ordinary man's good qualities could become crushing accusations against a guilty man.  At  least that was what struck me, and I stopped listening to the prosecutor until I heard him say, 'Has  he so much as expressed any remorse?  Never, gentlemen.  Not once during the preliminary  hearings  did this man show emotion over his heinous offense.'  At that point, he turned in my direction,  pointed his finger at me, and went on attacking me without ever really understanding why.  Of  course, I couldn't help admitting that he was right.I didn't feel much remorse for what I'd done.  But I was surprised by how relentless he was.  I would have liked to have tried explaining to him  cordially, almost affectionately, that I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything.  My  mind was always on what was coming next, today or tomorrow.<br />He is convicted and sentenced to the guillotine.  While awaiting execution he entertains one fleeting  dream of escape:<br />  The papers were always talking about the debt owed to society.  According to them, it had to be  paid.  But that doesn't speak to the imagination.  What really counted was the possibility of escape,  a leap to freedom, out of the implacable ritual, a wild run for it that would give whatever chance  for hope there was.  Of course, hope meant being cut down on some street corner, as you ran like  mad, by a random bullet.  But when I really thought it through, nothing was going to allow me  such a luxury.  Everything was against it; I would just be caught up in the machinery again.<br />And so, having accepted his fate again, Meursault finally has a moment of apotheosis.  A priest is  trying for the umpteenth time to counsel him, when:<br />  Then, I don't know why, but something inside me snapped.  I started yelling at the top of my lungs,  and I insulted him and told him not to waste his prayers on me.  I grabbed him by the collar of his  cassock. I was pouring out on him everything that was in my heart, cries of anger and cries of joy.  He seemed so certain about everything, didn't he?  And yet none of his certainties was worth one  hair of a woman's head.  He wasn't even sure he was alive, because he was living like a dead man.  Whereas it looked as if I was the one who'd come up emptyhanded.  But I was sure about me, about  everything, surer than he could ever be, sure of my life and sure of the death I had waiting for me.  Yes, that was all I had.  But at least I has as much of a hold on it as it had on me.  I had been right,  I was still right, I was always right.  I had lived my life one way and I could just as well have lived  it another.  I had done this and I hadn't done that.  I hadn't done this thing but I had done another.  And so?  It was as if I had waited all this time for this moment and for the first light of this dawn to  be vindicated.  Nothing, nothing mattered, and I knew why.  So did he.  Throughout the whole  absurd life I'd lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from somewhere deep in my future,  across years that were still to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever was offered to me  at the time, in years no more real than the ones I was living.  What did other people's deaths or a  mother's love matter to me; what did his God or the lives people choose or the fate they think they  elect matter to me when we're all elected by the same fate, me and billions of privileged people like  him who also called themselves my brothers?  Couldn't he see, couldn't he see that?  Everybody was  privileged.  There were only privileged people.  The others would all be condemned one day.  And  he would be condemned, too.<br />Exhausted by this outburst, Meursault sleeps and when he awakes a calmness has settled upon him:<br />  For the first time in a long time I thought about Maman.  I felt as if I understood why at the end  of  her life she had taken a 'fianc&eacute;,' why she had played at beginning again.  even there, in that home  where lives were fading out, evening was a kind of wistful respite.  So close to death, Maman must  have felt free then and ready to live it all again.  Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over her.  And I felt ready to live it all again too.  as if the blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope;  for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference  of the world.  Finding it so much like myself--so like a brother, really--I felt i had been happy and  that I was happy again.  For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to  wish that there was a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with  cries of hate.<br />So ends the novel, with Meursault having become a nearly Christlike figure, with grace descending  upon him as he awaits execution.<br />But, of course, the message here is anything but Christian.  Meursault's passivity in the face of life and  his indifference to the quality of his own actions, up to and including murder, are the inevitable  culmination of Existential philosophy.  For if it's true that nothing matters, why regulate your  behavior?  You may as well act on your every impulse.  The irony is that Camus used this as the  jumping off point to try to reconstruct morality, but on a Godless basis.  Unfortunately, experience  demonstrates that this task is impossible, not because of any intrinsically religious quality of God, but  because it removes the concept of the absolute and necessarily replaces it with the relative.  And once  morality is deemed a relative set of principles there is nothat was all I had.  But at least I has as much of a hold on it as it had on me.  I had been right,     I was still right, I was always right.  I had lived my life one way and I could just as well have lived     it another.  I had done this and I hadn't done that.

Cela was for many years denied the recognition he deserved due to his  membership in the Falangist party and his service on Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War, but  finally, in 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br />Pascual Duarte is a brutal Spanish peasant, shaped by poverty, ignorance and hatred.  The book  recounts his mounting depravity as he goes from killing his dog to knifing a romantic rival to final  horrific matricide.  Duarte falls prey to the type of alienation and world weariness described by the  Existentialists.  He describes himself prior to killing his mother:<br />  The day I decided I would have to use my knife on her, I was so weary of it all, so convinced in  my bones that bloodletting was the only cure, that the thought of her dying didn't even quicken my  pulse.  It was something fated, it had to be and would be.<br />And even as he writes this account of his life as he sits in prison, awaiting death, he acknowledges:<br />  ...there are moments when the telling of my own story gives me the most honest of honest  pleasures, perhaps because I feel so far removed from what I am telling that I seem to be repeating  a story from hearsay about some unknown person.<br />But Cela, unlike Camus, seems to trace Duarte's pathologies to his environment, to the circumstances  of his life, rather than trying to make a universal statement about the human condition.  Duarte is a  distinct type, but one that has been all too familiar in the Century.  His alienation, amorality and  brutality are summed up in a chilling assertion of his own inhumanity:<br />  ...I'm not made to philosophize, I don't have the heart for it.  My heart is more like a machine for  making blood to be spilt in a knife fight....<br />Nor does Cela offer much philosophical elaboration, neither to explain Duarte nor to offer a cure for  the world's Duartes.  Instead, what is really noticeable here is the absence of any institutions to  inculcate values or venues in which to express individual aspirations.  Missing are the Church, an open  economy and participatory democratic structures, the triune basis of modern Western civil society.  In  this sense, the novel sounds a cautionary note about the sorts of men that arise in this kind of moral  vacuum.<br />The novel is raw and powerful and compulsively readable.  It's outrageous that it is not currently in  print in English translation, but it is available through used booksellers and many libraries may stock  copies from when he won the Nobel.  Either way, it is well worth your effort to track it down.<br />GRADE: A-e fight....<br />Nor does Cela offer much philosophical elaboration, neither to explain Duarte nor to offer a cure for  the world's Duartes.

The narrator, Huw Morgan, tells the story of the  lives and loves of his extended family and their townfolk as their closeknit community disintegrates  under the pressures of modern life and the decreasing profitability of the mine--from brothers who  have to move to America to make a living or others who are killed in the coal pits, to the widowed  sister-in-law who Huw loves for years but never tells, to Mr. Gruffudd the local minister who helps  Huw through childhood paralysis &amp; becomes his tutor, to Dai Bando who teaches him to box and most  of all to the beloved parents who suffer long but love greatly.  The language itself is lyrical and  haunting, the story ineffably sad. But always, Huw reminds us that these remarkable people live on in  him:<br />  Courage came to me from the height of the mountain, and with it came the dignity of manhood,  and  knowledge of the Tree of Life, for now I was a branch, running with the vital blood, waiting in the  darkness of the Garden ....to bring forth sons and daughters.<br />  I saw behind me those who had gone, and before me, those who were to come.

Mr Algren can hit with both hands and move around andhe will kill you if you are not awfully careful ... Mr Algren, boy,you are good.  -Ernest Hemingway<br />Frankie Machine is the Man with theGolden Arm.  The arm is both a blessing and a curse--on the one hand,it makes him the best stud-poker dealer in Chicago and an aspiring,Gene Krupasque drummer, on the other, it is the vessel he uses toshoot heroin and, ultimately, to accidentally punch and kill hispusher.  Thus, there are multiple layers of meaning and irony whenFrankie says: &quot;It's all in the wrist, 'n I got thetouch.&quot;<br />For the most part, this inaugural winner of TheNational Book Award reads like an American take on Victor Hugo's LesMiserables.  Like Jean Valjean, Frankie's crimes are relatively minor,his addiction for instance is a result of morphine dependency hedeveloped after being wounded in WWII.  He even has his own InspectorJavert in Captain Bednar, who has spent twenty years doing his&quot;honest copper's duty&quot; but is now tormented by guilt, havingcome to believe that the people he has pursued are no more guilty thanhe.  But this does not stop him from pursuing Frankie through theseamy underside of Chicago, just as Javert pursued Valjean throughParis.<br />It is not surprising then that Algren shares Hugo's greatestweakness, that occupational hazard of the Intellectual, a romanticreverence for the poor.  Algren's Chicago is an enormous prison, theiron railways that bound the city becoming figurative bars on a cell.And the poverty and squalor that the characters live in creates anoppressive atmosphere from which there is no escape.  It is a world weare overly familiar with from such literature, where the junkies werejust unlucky, the hookers have hearts of gold, the murders areaccidents or acts of desperation and the cops who keep order realizein their secret hearts that the &quot;bad guys&quot; are really goodguys.  It never ceases to amaze me that writers like Hugo and Algren(and Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis and so on) are credited with beingrealistic, humanistic and compassionate.  As I've asked before, how domost of us have any idea if their portraits of the poor are realistic?(see Orrin's review of Dog Eat Dog (1996)(Edward Bunker) (Grade: B)).How many critics and academics know any inner city heroin addicts?Why should we believe, as Algren asks us to, that the average junkieis an unwilling victim of life's circumstances?  Perhaps the mostunrealistic passages in the book are those where the policeman Bednarsits wringing his hands in anguish at the injustice he perpetrates oncriminals.  I'll defer to my sister, who is a prosecutor, and herhusband, who is a cop, but I've known a fair number of law enforcementofficials and none of them resembled Bednar.  Your middle class guilttends to get sucked out of you pretty quickly once it comes in contactwith a few lowlifes.<br />But never mind for now whether Algren's visionof the urban poor is realistic; let's ask instead what his view saysabout humankind.  Fundamentally, he espouses a world view wherein thepoor are just like you and me only they got a few bad breaks and nowthey are unable to help themselves because of external forces.  Howcan this be the humanist position?  In some basic sense, Algren andhis ilk do not believe in Man, in his potential, in his power, in hisambition.  Instead, they believe in impersonal forces which govern Manand in Man's essential helplessness in the face of circumstance.  Thisstrikes me as anti-human.<br />As to compassion, one would have thoughtthe day was long since past when anyone believed that it iscompassionate to excuse the pathologies of the underclass and to tryto make them dependents of charitable largesse.  But check out thispassage from Russell Banks's intro to a reissue of Algren's novels:<br />It shouldn't surprise me that Nelson Algren, clearly one of the bestnovelists of histime, is not much read these days. It's the ''killthe messenger'' syndrome, I suppose, for the news that Algren's worksbrings us is not good news: if the world he describes is at all likeour own, then it's not morning in America, and it hasn't been for along, long time.

They feared that it would make an easy target for the increasingly numerous  critics of Camus, who had gone from being an icon of the left, winning the Nobel Prize in 1957, to  being a pariah, because of his principled stand on two issues: first, he refused to turn a blind eye to the  Gulag and denounced the totalitarian methods of the Soviet Union; second, he refused to go along with  the Algeria-for-the-Arabs climate of the times, calling instead for a sharing of power between natives  and European colonists.  In addition, the preoccupation with morality in his writings struck the  intellectuals of his day as antiquated and quaint.  Publishing a fragmentary work would have invited  attacks on his already sliding reputation by a literary class which had turned on him for these myriad  political reasons.<br />The novel, which was actually found in the wreckage of his car, would indeed have been greeted with  hoots and catcalls by the Left.  It is the most sentimental and personal of all his works.  The story of  Jacques Cormery's return to Algeria and his reflections on his coming of age is filled with inchoate  longing, for the Algeria of his youth, for the Father who died when he was just a child, for the love of  a beautiful but deaf and distant Mother and for a moral code by which to live.  It brilliantly evokes a  distinct place and time and the happy memories of a difficult childhood.  There are numerous vignettes  that earn a place in memory--from the disappointment of winning a schoolyard brawl &quot;vanquishing a  man is as bitter as being vanquished&quot;, to the embarrassment of reading movie subtitles aloud to his  illiterate grandmother.  Taken on its own terms, the novel is a classic tale of youth and moral  development.  And in terms of our understanding of the mature Camus, it goes a long way to  explaining the sense of alienation which pervades all of his other writings.<br />His failure to toe the politically correct line is most evident in his treatment of the incipient Arab  uprising.  Here is what a French farmer tells his employees after he plows under his own farm:<br />  The Arab workers were waiting for him in the yard...&quot;Boss, what are we going to do?&quot;<br />  If I were in your shoes, the old man said, &quot;I'd go join the guerillas.  They're going to win.  There're  no men left in France.&quot;<br />Not exactly a sentiment that's designed to ingratiate the author with either of the fanatic Wings of  French politics, Left nor Right.<br />But ultimately, the book is most important for the way in which it illuminates the author's life long  attempt to craft a moral structure that will obtain despite his belief that life is finite, directionless and  fundamentally pointless.  The course of the Century has seen morality reduced to a bourgeois,  conservative concern.  An author, theoretically of the Left, who was so concerned with morality, was,  and would still be today, a complete anachronism.  The fact that sentiments like the epigraph above (It  is better to be wrong by killing no one than to be right with mass graves.) were sufficient to earn him  the enmity of the intellectual elites of his day, is indicative of the degree to which the Left has  abandoned any pretense of moral reasoning, in favor of an orientation towards politically desirable  results, regardless of the means used to arrive at those ends.<br />The Myth of Sisyphus is the central metaphor of existentialism in the writings of Camus (see Orrin's  review).  Sisyphus was one of the Titans and, for his rebellion against the Gods, he was sentenced to  roll an enormous boulder up a hill.  Every day the boulder would roll back to the bottom and he  would have to start over again.  Camus used this senseless, unproductive task to symbolize all of  human existence.  Man is trapped in a life which never achieves anything, has no meaning beyond  mere existence and leaves no aftereffects upon his death.<br />It is ironic then that this greatest philosopher of existentialism, a life denying theory which inevitably  leads to the Death Camps, should have written this beautifully life affirming work.  As his daughter  says in her intro, Camus would never have published such an open and honest novel, he would have  masked his personal feelings.  We are lucky he never got the chance, because what survives here, in a  raw unfinished form, is his best work--a story which demonstrates that life is not tragic but rather that  even a brutally difficult life of emotional isolation and grinding poverty can produce a great man like  Albert Camus.  That a life which seemingly illustrates his dictum about the harsh senseless nature of  existence, should forge a man of such adamantium moral rectitude and that he, in this most revelatory  work, should look back on those years with so much love and nostalgia, for me at least, puts the lie to  the theory that existence consists of little more than Sisyphiphean despair and endurance.<br />There is nothing absurd or desperate about the life that he portrays here; his accidental honesty  provides an overwhelming argument against the very philosophy he espoused.  And the capacity of  even his impoverished and ignorant family to forge a Camus and the enduring influence of both his  writing and the example that he set by speaking important truths demonstrates that man is capable of  progress, indeed is continually making progress.  France, a nation with much to be ashamed of, should  be especially embarrassed that the best work of its best philosopher had to await the fall of  Communism before friends and family felt that his reputation could withstand the revelation of this  masterpiece.  But then again, the fact that it can safely be published now is another sign of progress.<br />GRADE: A+Every day the boulder would roll back to the bottom and he  would have to start over again.

He  remained married to her until his death 50 years later. In marrying her, he sacrificed his natural  inclinations for social convention.<br />  Mann found very young men beautiful, but his homosexuality remained hidden for 50 years after  his death, when his diaries were released. These revealed that he was prone to fits of nausea,  nervous, trembling and convulsive sobbing quite at odds with his public image of elegant,  self-assured aloofness. He was fortunate that the Nazis never discovered his secret.  -BBC Education: Biography of Thomas Mann<br />The quote above is merely one of a number of similar sentiments that I found when I was looking for  links for this review and I must admit, they completely mystify me.  How could anyone read this story  and not realize that Mann was an almost heroically repressed homosexual?<br />Death in Venice tells the story of Gustav von Aschenbach, a German writer, who decides that he needs  a holiday to relieve the stress of his &quot;nerve-taxing&quot; work.  Eventually he arrives in Venice and  conceives a passionate crush on a a fourteen year old boy named Tadzio.  As he grows ever more  obsessed with the boy, Aschenbach's mind becomes increasingly unbalanced.  He takes to following  the lad around and refuses to leave Venice despite an outbreak of cholera, virtually courting death in  order to indulge his desires.  Finally, as Tadzio frolics in the waves at the beach, Aschenbach dies  quietly in a beach chair.<br />Just in case the reader hasn't gotten the hint, Mann helpfully provides Aschenbach one extended  soliloquy:<br />  For mark you, Phaedrus, beauty alone is both divine and visible; and so it is the sense way, the  artist's way, little Phaedrus, to the spirit. But, now tell me, my dear boy, do you believe that such a  man can ever attain wisdom and true manly worth, for whom the path to the spirit must lead  through the senses? Or do you rather think-for I leave the point to you-that it is a path of perilous  sweetness, a way of transgression, and must surely lead him who walks in it astray? For you know  that we poets cannot walk the way of beauty without Eros as our companion and guide.  We may be  heroic after our fashion, disciplined warriors of our craft, yet are we all the women, for we exult in  passion, and love is still our desire-our craving and our shame. And from this you will perceive that  we poets can be neither wise nor worthy citizens. We must needs be wanton, must needs rove at  large in the realm of feeling. Our magisterial style is all folly and pretence, our honourable repute a  farce, the crowd's belief in us is merely laughable.  And to teach youth, or the populace, by means  of art is a dangerous practice and ought to be forbidden. For what good can an artist be as a teacher,  when from his birth up he is headed direct for the pit? We may want to shun it and attain to honour  in the world; but however we turn, it draws us still. So, then, since knowledge might destroy us, we  will have none of it. For knowledge, Phaedrus, does not make him who possesses it dignified or  austere.  Knowledge is all-knowing, understanding, forgiving; it takes up no position, sets no store  by form. It has compassion with the abyss-it is the abyss. So we reject it, firmly, and henceforward  our concern shall be with beauty only. And by beauty we mean simplicity, largeness, and renewed  severity of discipline; we mean a return to detachment and to form. But detachment, Phaedrus, and  preoccupation with form lead to intoxication and desire, they may lead the noblest among us to  frightful emotional excesses, which his own stern cult of the beautiful would make him the first to  condemn. So they too, they too, lead to the bottomless pit. Yes, they lead us thither, I say, us who  are poets-who byour natures are prone not to excellence but to excess.<br />Mann, who had studied and was influenced by Nietzsche, here posits the artist as a Dionysian, drawn  to the purely sensual.  But at the same time he recognizes that this attraction to the non-rational realm  is self destructive; yield to desire and you end up, like Aschenbach, first insane and then dead.  The  artist is counterpoised against the wise and rational citizenery, whom Nietzsche termed Apollonians  (see Orrin's review of The Birth of Tragedy (1872)(Friedrich Nietzsche 1844-1900) (Grade: C).  I've tried several times to read Mann's novels--Buddenbrooks, The Magic Mountain, Doctor  Faustus--and I have to admit I find them unreadable, but supposedly this struggle between reason and  passion is a consistent theme.<br />Yet when Mann's diaries were published in the 1980's--revealing a man who, despite a successful  marriage lasting half a century and producing six children, was continually smitten with young men,  typically the waiters in his favorite restaurants--the critics claim to have been shocked by the revelation  of his homoerotic yearnings.  Significantly, there is no evidence that he acted on these impulses.  He  appears to have submerged his carnal appetite for boys in favor of a conventional family life.  I simply  do not understand why this should have surprised anyone; it seems perfectly consistent with the vision  of this story that he would have chosen not to end up like Aschenbach himself.<br />This is not a terribly enjoyable story to read and there aren't really any sympathetic characters.  Nor do  I find Mann's prose particularly compelling; as I mentioned, I've found his other works to be pretty  tough sledding.  But taken purely as a cautionary tale, it's at least mildly worthwhile reading.<br />GRADE: Ctoo, lead to the bottomless pit.

Du Bois Institute)	Books	2	4	9	N	N	get on with your lives	NATURAL EQUITY - That which is founded in natural justice, in honesty and  right, and which arises ex aequo et bono. It corresponds precisely with the  definition of justice or natural law, which is a constant and perpetual will to give  to every man what is his. This kind of equity embraces so wide a range, that  human tribunals have never attempted to enforce it. Every code of laws has left  many matters of natural justice or equity wholly unprovided for, from the  difficulty of framing general rules to meet them, from the almost impossibility of  enforcing them, and from the doubtful nature of the policy of attempting to give a  legal sanction to duties of imperfect obligation, such as charity, gratitude, or  kindness.  -'Lectric Law Library<br />For all I know, Wole Soyinka may be a very fine playwright; I've never seen nor read one of his  plays.  But after reading this collection of three lectures--The 1997 W.E.B. Du Bois Institute  Macmillan lectures at Harvard University--I can say that as a moral philosopher he leaves much to be  desired.  In the most important and topical lecture here--Reparations, Truth, and Reconciliation--he  argues that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission can not serve a redemptive function,  nor can any such process, because:<br />  Where there has been inequity, especially of a singularly brutalizing kind, of a kind that robs one  side of its most fundamental attribute -- its humanity -- it seems only appropriate that some form of  atonement be made, in order to exorcise that past. Reparations, we repeat, serve as a cogent critique  of history and thus a potent restraint on its repetition.<br />This analysis leads him to call for some kind of unspecified universal reparations, which he suggests  Western nations should voluntarily provide as a form of equity settlement for the damages that the  West inflicted upon blacks generally and Africa specifically.<br />At the outset, let me just say that I am not completely hostile to the idea of reparations for American  blacks descended from slaves.  I find compelling the thesis of Thomas Sowell, the great black  conservative intellectual, that the reasons for black underperformance in the American economy can in  large part be traced back to the historical distinctness of their forced migration.  He offers a wealth of  evidence that as a general rule immigrant groups have succeeded in the U.S., regardless of race, creed,  or color.  Even black immigrant groups who have come voluntarily--i.e., Haitians--have done very  well.  Moreover, there is a consistent pattern to the success of all groups.  The first generation, which  is sort of a self-selected group of ambitious, highly motivated go-getters, works incredibly hard in less  wellpaying fields, but is then able to send the second generation on to college and beyond.  This  second generation does as well as or better than the children of more established ethnic cohorts.  Thus,  a Hmong tribesman or an Ethiopian refugee may come to America and have to work three menial jobs  to feed his family, but his children are doctors, lawyers and the like.<br />The problem that black America has uniquely had to face (Native Americans are a different, though  not dissimilar case) is that they had no such first generation to provide the impetus for a drive towards  the middle class.  Instead, the entire population of ex-slaves was merely turned out and told to get by  as well as they could.  Then the white population did everything in it's power to make sure that they  could not succeed.  We can obviously never know if Abraham Lincoln would have been able to handle  the Reconstruction period differently, recall that he envisioned giving blacks their own country in  Central America, but we do know that a singular opportunity was squandered in the War's aftermath.  Imagine how much different the history of America in general and black America in particular might  have been, had we truly provided all freed slaves with forty acres and a mule and moved them North  and West, where they might have escaped from the worst manifestations of white resentment.<br />In light of the opportunity, indeed the obligation, that was missed, it would seem that some form of  reparations might not be out of the question.  However, a Reparations Bill should: spell out quite  specifically that it is a one time deal meant to address a distinct wrong, that it is being done, not  because the current generation of Americans owes any debt in particular, but as an act of charity  because we can very specifically identify a harm and a class of victims; should include an end to all  affirmative action programs; should only be made available to blacks who are descended from slaves;  and should be structured in such a way that aid can only be used for home purchases or education.  I  would consider such an undertaking to be a pure act of charity, one that would be fine if the people  decided to do it on our own, but which would be illegal, unconstitutional and morally repellent if  Court ordered.<br />Mr. Soyinka on the other hand, believes that as a matter of Equity the West owes Reparations to all  blacks.  His case is stunningly weak.  He needs three things to convince his jury of readers: a harm, a  wrongdoer and a victim.  First, as to harm, it is really difficult for me to believe that if an impartial  observer looked at the condition of black Africans in the 15th Century and the condition of blacks  throughout the world now in the 21st Century, that he would perceive their contact with the West to  have been a net negative.  The impact of Western learning, industry, medicine, political institutions,  and so forth have surely had a sufficiently beneficial impact to at least equal, if not outweigh, the  negative impacts of slavery, colonization and Apartheid.  Indeed, by any standard, a &quot;reasonable man&quot;  would have to say that blacks who are currently residing in the West have a higher standard of living,  not merely than they would have had the West never found Africa, but than blacks who reside in the  free and black ruled nations of Africa.  As a matter of fact, in many of those nations the populace was  probably better off prior to independence than they are now.  These facts make it difficult to argue  that there is a genuine &quot;harm&quot; to be redressed.  (see also Orrin's review of Things Fall Apart by  Chinua Achebe)<br />Second, as to the wrongdoers, though we lament the truly horrific thing that was done to black  Africans, their enslavement, and though we must never forget the truth that, for all it's humanistic  rhetoric and ideals, our Western Civilization perpetrated this evil, we must also recognize that it was  Western Civilization which was responsible for ending the horror.  We must recognize that the  generations which committed these acts should not be judged by our modern standards and that, in any  case, they are long gone.  In short, there are no wrongdoers to be punished.<br />Finally, as to the victims, forget for a moment the impossibility of sorting out how much each person  of African descent was harmed and how much compensation each is entitled to.  Forget the issue of to  what degree some Africans participated in and benefited by the enslavement of others.  Forget the  issue of how African leaders since the end of the Imperialism period have governed their own nations  and treated their own peoples.  Forget all of these red flag issues and emotion laden diversions; the  more important question for Black Africa and for it's intellectual leaders like Mr. Soyinka is:  Does  this obsessive focus on the past help to create a brighter future for Africa?  Although it is a truism, the  future is not about the past.  In making the case for monetary damages, the author alludes to Holocaust  survivors and their quest for reparations and for restoration of lost bank accounts.  There's no need to  rehash the issue of actual victims and actual wrongdoers, the more significant fact that he's missed is  that European Jews did not sit around waiting for these damages to be paid.  They seized the moment,  fled to better lives in America and established their own nation in Israel.  They moved forward and are  a stronger, better people for it.<br />The course that Mr. Soyinka counsels, backward looking, grudge nursing, scab picking, entitlement  claiming, as it is, must surely be a recipe for continued stagnation and even decline in Africa.  The  cold hard truth is that the West will send aid to Africa, not for reasons of guilt or of obligation or of  cosmic moral justice, but for that most basic, most Western, of all reasons : because Africans represent  a huge underutilized customer base for Western business.  It is the height of folly for the best minds of  Africa to waste their time on such a notion as Western reparations to Africa.  It's over.  You have your  freedom.  You run your own countries.  Your destiny is once again in your own hands.

I have been to seek a wife, she's the joy of my young life,  She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother.  -Billy Boy<br />Alice McDermott pulled off a major upset when she beat out Tom Wolfe for the National Book Award  this year.  I know it sent me scurrying for her books to figure out what I was missing; having now  read At Weddings and Wakes (1992) &amp; Charming Billy, I'd have to say that Ms McDermott is a gifted  writer whose &quot;Irish-American angst&quot; is not for me.  I admire her ability to evoke memories of the  suburban 50's &amp; 60's, but her stories are so submerged in bathos that they become somewhat grating.  After all, the stories--At Weddings and Wakes dwelt on a woman's disappointment in her marriage and  her husband, Charming Billy tells the story of a supposedly charming drunkard, whose life was  irreparably damaged by the purported death of a young love--are asking us to feel pity for people who,  while things haven't worked out exactly as they hoped, are living lives of enormous privilege in  America's Golden Age.  As I read them, I found them pinioned by two Irish American memoirs:  Doris Kearns Goodwin's Wait Till Next Year (1997) and Frank McCourt's Angela Ashes.  Goodwin  treats much the same people, in much the same neighborhoods, but where McDermott is morose,  Goodwin is effervescent.  Goodwin clearly recognizes the extraordinary gift that she was handed,  growing up during that time and even family tragedy can not dim the glow.  Meanwhile, McCourt's  book shows us people who do deserve some pity, children growing up in grinding poverty, but does  not ask for it.  His book is a triumphal rise from the gutter and a loving look back at what must have  been an extremely difficult early life.  Turn then to the pages of Charming Billy and we have a man  drinking himself to death because the woman he knew for one week one summer did not end up as his  wife.  C'mon.  There is a sense in which to write such elegaic stories about the &quot;difficult&quot; lives of these  characters is to lie.<br />I anxiously await the novel where McDermott lightens up and recognizes how good she and her  characters have had it in suburban America in the past forty years.<br />Grade: C-mer did not end up as his  wife.

It had a  cover painting of a Cossack or someone wielding a saber and an introduction by James Michener.  Either Michener or a cover blurb referred to the book, With Fire and Sword, as the great novel of  Poland.  So I figured what the hey, and I bought it.  Well, suffice it to say, Henryk Sienkiewicz is  now one of my all-time favorite authors.<br />Basically, Sienkiewicz was a victim of a trap that I had never previously given much thought to; he  simply had no great modern translator to render his work accessible to us.  With Fire and Sword and  the volumes that followed it to form a trilogy had not been translated into English since Jeremiah  Curtin, a friend of Theodore Roosevelt, did so on their publication.  Though there appears to be some  scholarly dispute about the quality of Curtin's work, I tried reading reading his translation of the  middle volume, The Deluge, because the new translation is almost impossible to find, and I have to  say that as desperately as I wanted to read it, I could not get into the flow of his text.  The Polish  names make for tough sledding anyway, but combined with his fairly archaic English, I just couldn't  take it.<br />Quo Vadis? has actually remained more popular over the years, in fact it is one of the best selling  novels of all time, so there have been decent translations available all along, but you really should seek  out the W. S. Kuniczak version if you can find it.  Kuniczak, himself a novelist, devoted at least six  years to updating Sienkiewicz's Trilogy and his dedication to the author's work paid off brilliantly.  Though still recognizably written in the style and language of a hundred years ago, the books now read  with a much more natural flow.  His background as a novelist seems to have served him well, because  rather than reading like someone converted Polish to English verbatim, they read like an English  retelling of the Polish tale.  That obviously could be cause for concern to folks who have a thorough  grounding in the original, particularly if he took great license with the author's work, but as a reader,  all I really care about is that his versions are terrific books.<br />The novel--which will particularly appeal to anyone who enjoyed Ben-Hur (see Orrin's review) or The  Robe--is set in Nero's Rome and is built around the stark contrast between the voluptuary decadent  Romans and the ascetic Christians.  Vinitius is a patrician in good standing at Nero's court until he  falls in love with the Christian girl Ligia.  At first somewhat reluctantly, but then with gathering  fervor, Vinitius is drawn out of the moral depths of his prior life and himself becomes a Christian.  By  the time that Nero burns down Rome and blames the Christians, Vinitius has become a believer and is  prepared to sacrifice his position and even his life to save Ligia from the Coliseum and the Games  where Nero sacrifices Christians to distract the restless populace of Rome.<br />In addition to Bread and Circuses and the romantic tale, there are scenes of surpassing beauty centered  on Christian faith.  One such is Vinitius's baptism scene; after he tries futilely to convince the Apostle  Peter to flee to Sicily with him and Ligia, Peter responds:<br />  &quot;The Lord will bless you for your kind heart and noble feeling, but you do not realize that the  Master Himself thrice repeated to me the words, 'Feed my sheep.'&quot;<br />  Vinitius became silent not knowing what to respond.<br />  Peter continued, &quot;I cannot leave my flock in the day of disaster.  When there was a storm on the  lake and we were all terrified in the boat, the Lord did not desert us.  Why should I, His servant,  desert my flock, those whom He has given me?&quot;<br />  Then Linus raised up his emaciated head and said weakly, &quot;O Peter, Christ's appointed shepherd,  why should I not follow your example?&quot;<br />  Vinitius rubbed his forehead as if struggling with his thoughts, then taking Ligia by the hand spoke  to all present: &quot;Hear me, Peter, Linus and you, Ligia.  I only spoke as my own human intellect  dictated.  However all of you reason according to Christ and His teaching.  I don't fully understand  that yet and my inclination and my thinking is still different from yours.

Try shaking that image from your  head.  At any rate, Kikuji, now a grown man, becomes involved with both another mistress of his now  deceased father's and her daughter.  Meanwhile, the birthmarked mistress somehow feels free to  meddle in his life and tries to set him up with another young woman.  All of this is set against the  backdrop of the ritual of the ancient Japanese tea ceremony.  Eventually, as it must, tragedy strikes as  one woman after another commits suicide.<br />Yeah, so?<br />If the word dysfunctional did not exist, it would have to have been invented to describe Kikuji's  romantic life.  As if wading through your old man's detritus was not bad enough, topping it off by  pursuing a mother and daughter would have to be described as begging for trouble.  Add to this the  fact that none of the characters are terribly likable and that Kikuji is almost completely passive and  you've got a book that is hard to fathom or to like.

Political liberalism, on the other hand, assumes that bureaucrats and technocrats can improve  upon centuries old social structures, cultural inheritances and moral codes.  But there is one area where  the roles of the two are reversed and that is when it comes to the environment.  The American Left has  a long standing love affair with nature; from Jefferson to Thoureau, Teddy Roosevelt to Al Gore,  there is a pastoral strain to liberal politics, a kind of religious belief in an Edenic past and a nearly  Biblical sense that man's attempts to control nature have a corrupting influence.<br />This sentiment has perhaps never been treated more beautifully in our Literature than in Faulkner's  great short novel, The Bear.  The story of a succession of hunting seasons is basically a warning from  Faulkner that as we destroy the wilderness we threaten the traditions and values of our society.  Nature  is symbolized by the cagey ancient ursine, Old Ben.  Most of the tale is told by Ike McCaslin, who is  10 years old as it begins.  Initially he flounders through the woods, but as he surrenders himself to the  primordial forces of Nature, he is able to sense the bear's presence.  Another year, when he sets aside  his gun and compass and other accouterments of civilization, he is finally able to see the bear.  Gradually he earns his way into the aristocracy of the wild, until, together with Sam Fathers (part  black, part Indian, he represents a kind of noble savage) and Boon Hogganbeck (a sort of elemental  force of nature) and a suicidally fearless dog named Lion, he hunts down Old Ben after the bear  violates the unwritten code of the woods by attacking a horse.  But even as Old Ben succumbs, he will  take some of them with him and his parting signals the end of a way of life.<br />Despite some too obscure interior monologue passages, this is Faulkner's most accessible work.  It is  the only Faulkner I've ever actually reread and it is so rife with symbolism and ulterior meanings, that  you can always find something new in it.  And, for whatever reason, it is further evidence that sports  writing brings out the best in almost every author (see also &quot;Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu&quot; by John  Updike), in fact, it is often anthologized in Greatest Sports Story collections.

The main criticism of the novel appears to be  that O'Connor was too benevolent in his portrayal of a big city political boss and of machine politics  generally.  But I think that this complaint really misses the central insight of the story.  Whatever  Frank Skeffington's faults may be--and it is at least implied that he is financially corrupt and is readily  apparent that he has become morally corrupt in the pursuit of power--he is also undeniably an  interesting and compelling personality.  As the Monsignor says at his funeral :<br />  The bigger the man is in public life, the bigger the praise or the blame--and we have to remember  that Frank Skeffington was quite a big man.<br />What Edwin O'Connor discerned was that the modern, clean-cut, college-educated, television-age,  politicians would be equally corrupt, but would be little men.  Like news anchormen, they would look  well-polished and nicely groomed, but they would be empty suits. Marketed like household products,  they would be chosen specifically because they were so colorless, so unlikely to put off the  voter/consumer.  And so we are left with the worst of both worlds : the politicians are still power  hungry crooks, but now they have no entertainment value to redeem them.<br />Skeffington's ultimate legacy is bookended between two other sentiments expressed after his death.  Nathaniel Gardiner, the old line WASP who sparred with but respected the Mayor, thinks to himself :  &quot;If only he had not been such a rogue...&quot; but then realizes that had he been less a rogue, he would have  been less of a figure.  But perhaps the final assessment belongs to the Cardinal who had battled him for  so long :<br />  Whether you realize it or not now, you will later on. This man cheapened us forever at a time when  we could have gained stature. I can never forgive him for that.<br />O'Connor, though he makes Skeffington an immensely entertaining and likable character, can hardly  be accused of whitewashing the true nature of such men.  To say that someone &quot;cheapened us&quot; is, or  used to be, a pretty serious indictment.<br />GRADE : Ae.

Like it's excellent  predecessor, Palace Walk, it follows the family saga of the patriarchal merchant al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd  al-Jawad and his children in 1920s Egypt.  The changes occurring in the family parallel the upheaval  in the outside world as a new generation comes to power, challenging al-Sayyid on the one hand and  English rule on the other.  The particular focus of this installment is Kamal, a nascent writer who is  apparently modeled on Mahfouz himself.<br />The book brilliantly evokes the lost world of 20's Cairo and there are some funny set pieces, typically  involving sex.  But the story is badly under plotted and presents fairly few ideas, two factors which  combine to make for a pretty lackluster read.  As the story meanders along, we get a richly detailed  picture of these peoples lives, but seem to be living them in real time; one longs for something, other  than the sort of casual serial adultery which is the staple of the book, to happen.<br />I didn't like it nearly as much as Palace Walk, but it was still worthwhile as a sharply observed portrait  of a time and place about which we in the West know fairly little.<br />GRADE: C+	2000-11-18

It's the amusing tale of a spoiled heir to the throne, so obnoxious that  he's known as Prince Brat, and of Jeremy, the peasant rat-catcher's son, who is drafted into the King's  service to stand in for the Prince when he earns a whipping.  Of course, having a whipping boy who  gets punished in your stead leaves you little incentive to improve your behavior.  The Prince is so  incorrigible that he hasn't even learned to read and write, though Jeremy has just by overhearing the  lessons.  When one day the Prince decides to run away, Jeremy follows, figuring he has nothing to  lose, since he'll be beaten for it anyway.  But things take an unexpectedly nasty turn when the boys are  captured by two cutthroats: Cutwater and Hold-Your-Nose Billy.  The quick thinking Jeremy is able to  convince the bandits that he's the Prince, since after all, he's the one who's literate, and tries to get  them to release his compatriot; but the obnoxious Prince is so offended that he refuses to take this  means of escape.  Gradually, as their misadventures continue, the boys learn to respect and even like  one another and all, of course, ends happily.<br />One thing that occurred to me in reading this story is the way that Anglo-American literature turns the  traditional fairy tale of mistaken identity on it's head.  The emblematic story of European tradition  would be the Frog Prince, wherein the royal personage lies buried beneath a facade, but inevitably is  discovered and accedes to his birthright.  American stories like this one and Prince and the Pauper  have as their premise that the regal upbringing has left the heir somehow unfit to rule and only after  experiencing life as a commoner can they rightly ascend to power.  The contrast obviously owes much  to the underlying political philosophy of the respective cultures--the former supporting the idea of  nobility being a function of birth, the latter premised on, if not consent of the ruled, at least a  requirement of worthiness on the part of the ruler and an informed understanding of the plight of his  subjects.<br />Kids needn't be concerned with all that though, they can just sit back and enjoy this amusing adventure  for it's own sake.  We savvy parents will keep the subliminal democratizing message to ourselves.<br />GRADE: B+nobility being a function of birth, the latter premised on, if not consent of the ruled, at least a  requirement of worthiness on the part of the ruler and an informed understanding of the plight of his  subjects.<br />Kids needn't be concerned with all that though, they can just sit back and enjoy this amusing adventure  for it's own sake.

Artists and authors used to be  able to assume that they and their audience shared a Culture which partook of a definite system of  values and beliefs.  When we read Shakespeare or look at a painting by Rembrandt or listen to music  by Bach, we can feel that we share in the artists vision and we can readily comprehend the  fundamental messages that underlie their works.  This does not rob them of their depth or their rich  textures--merely think of all the reams of paper that have been consumed in dissecting the character of  Hamlet--but it does mean that they are accessible to the general public by reference to our common  heritage.<br />Modernity has replaced such universal art with the subjective, the self-indulgent and the abstruse.  The  themes and messages of art are now unique to the artist/author and the audience is expected to study  the individual creator in order to try to understand their works.  And since it is no longer important to  these artists to convey their meanings, technical proficiency, narrative structure and clarity have given  way to idiosyncrasy and abstraction.  Of course, the best illustrations of this revolution came early on  in the process; after the intelligentsia accepted James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake (see Orrin's review),  Jackson Pollack's paint splatters and musical innovations like dissonance and atonality as legitimate  advances in the arts, it pretty much opened the doors to anything.  Once you abandon objective  standards for determining value, which the critics largely have done, you lose the capacity to  differentiate good art from bad art.  You are left with the oddly bifurcated culture that we see now,  where the public shuns the very product that the elites run up the flagpole.  Joyce may be considered  the greatest author of the 20th Century, but nobody has ever read either Ulysses (see Orrin's review) or  Finnegan's Wake from cover to cover.  There's not a living room in America with a Pollack on the  wall and the only Picasso is his Don Quixote, a fairly conventional representational piece which unlike  his most critically acclaimed work refers to one of the world's enduring literary masterpieces.  And  Classical music has innovated to the point of extinction.  It's time for someone to step in and tell the  avant garde that no one followed them and the experiment, having failed, is over.<br />All of which brings us to Jazz by Toni Morrison.  I didn't hate this book, the way I did Beloved (see  Orrin's review).  The central event of the story is once again an incomprehensible murder--this time a  middle aged man kills his young lover in order to preserve the feelings their affair has produced.  His  wife, upon learning of the liaison, mutilates the corpse; but the two inexplicably resume their married  life.  So okay, it's a tad melodramatic and unlikely, but great fiction has been built on such shaky  foundations before.  Morrison however seems uninterested in mining any psychological depths or  spinning out any conclusions from her basic set up.  Instead the book is sort of a set of bluesy  linguistic riffs on Renaissance Harlem, ping ponging backwards and forwards in time, and it does  contain some beautiful passages of prose; but to what end?  We never really connect with or care about  any of the characters.  We know about the crimes from the word go, so there's no dramatic tension.  Do the periodic phrases of lambent, tumescent prosody really suffice to make the book worthwhile?  I  think not.  The beauty of language has fairly little to do with the basic value of a work of fiction.  The  Sears Catalogue might sound pretty to some people if read aloud in French, but that doesn't make it  great literature.<br />Here's a little clue for you--when the professional reviewers praise the language but pan the storyand  the regular readers (at sites like Amazon) say they loved it even though they didn't understand it, it's  safe to assume that you've got an author who's skating on reputation and warning flags should go up in  your head.  Morrison's Nobel Prize is probably unwarranted by any measure, but it certainly receives  no validation from this book.<br />GRADE: Dand  the regular readers (at sites like Amazon) say they loved it even though they didn't understand it, it's  safe to assume that you've got an author who's skating on reputation and warning flags should go up in  your head.

But Siddartha is a fine novel and he wrote the only truly great novel about the game M'Laba  Laba (Magister Ludi: The Glass Bead Game), so we'll cut him some slack.<br />This very brief novel consists of the report of a failed pilgrimage to the East by a group of men who  belong to a mysterious League.  In the course of relating their misadventures, the narrator realizes that  the pilgrimage was part of a much larger effort to collect all of human knowledge in one place, that  his version of events differs from that of others, that many great thinkers have also participated in this  effort and finally, when he despairs of their ever succeeding, that he is being tested and has failed the  test.  But out of this despair he is able to grow in understanding.  As he is told:<br />  ...despair is the result of each earnest attempt to go through life with virtue, justice and  understanding and to fulfil their requirements.  Children live on one side of despair, the awakened  on  the other side.<br />Having emerged on the other side of despair, he is accepted as a full League member.<br />The story is okay as far it goes; it just doesn't go very far.  All of these elements are completely  derivative, all pilfered from Christianity then dressed up in mysticism.  And if you are going to  propound this kind of faux Eastern philosophy bilge, there really ought to be some reason behind it.

It combines something of the manic intensity of Dostoevskey's  portrayal of Raskalnikov, with the first person narrative and near hallucinatory vision of Charles  Bukowski--the visions brought on by starvation rather than alcohol in this case--and is told in the  spare, punchy prose that the author learned while working in America.  The message of the book  seems to be that the experience of poverty and hunger are a necessary fuel to stoke the author's artistic  fires.<br />It remains for the reader to determine whether Hamsun has been blessed with a universal revelation, or  merely a personal insight.  The idea of suffering for art and of inspiration coming from hallucination  have certainly been influential--we think of Faulkner, Hemingway, Henry Miller, William S.  Burroughs, Mailer, etc., as writers who sought the profound in a bottle, a needle or a bimbo.  However, other than Bukowski and a little bit of Hunter Thompson, it is hard to think of many authors  whose dissipation has helped produce much that's worth reading.  Significantly, the good stuff that  even they produced details their adventures while under the influence, not any revelations about the  broader world that resulted from said mind altering.  But the danger here is that such authors tend to  risk self-indulgence--remarkably few writers can make their own debauchery into interesting  prose--and often sacrifice coherence.<br />As for the specific value of hunger and suffering as muses, they obviously have none.  Virtually all of  the world's great literature has been the product of its fattest most self-satisfied cultures.  If there truly  were some association between a gnawing in the belly and significant writing, we'd be awash in the  novels of Appalachia, North Korea, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, etc..<br />Hamsun's novel then, while it was obviously influential and remains an interesting document of one  man's experiences without food, is ultimately too individualistic to offer us much insight on the human  condition generally.  The brevity, intensity and readability of the book recommend it; but it has fairly  little to say.  His Nobel Prize is sufficiently embarrassing in light of his subsequent adoration of Adolf  Hitler and advocacy of the Third Reich, but it also seems an inappropriate honor for an author whose  work lacks a universal message.<br />GRADE: Cand remains an interesting document of one  man's experiences without food, is ultimately too individualistic to offer us much insight on the human  condition generally.

Obi Okonkwo, grandson of the protagonist in Things Fall Apart, is the pride of his Nigerian village,  Umuofia.  The Ibo villagers pooled their money to send one native son off to England to be educated  and Obi was chosen.  Now he has returned to a prestigious job with the civil service in Lagos--he's the  Administrative Assistant to the Inspector of Schools.  He bears the burden of his people's expectations  but his exposure to Western culture has distanced him from tribal life and though he is now earning a  magnificent living by their standards, he has trouble making ends meet as he tries keeping up with the  Joneses in the big city.  Borrowing money, he ends up &quot;digging a new pit to fill up an old one.&quot;  Further complicating matters is his love affair with the lovely Clara, an osu, one of the  socio-religious outcasts who also figured prominently in Things Fall Apart.<br />As financial and romantic pressures continue to mount and his beloved mother sickens and dies, Obi  must also deal with temptation, offers of money and sex if he will use his position to assist scholarship  applicants.  For as long as he can, Obi juggles all of these problems, but gradually they come crashing  down on him.<br />More directly than almost any author I'm aware of, Chinua Achebe faces head on the issues which  confront the developing nations in a post-Colonial world.  In No Longer At Ease, even as he pokes fun  at the remaining English bureaucrats and their condescending ways, he honors their tradition of  relatively honest civil service.  Meanwhile, he questions whether at least this first generation of natives  who are replacing the departing Europeans are truly prepared to meet the same standards or whether a  slide into corruption is nearly inevitable.<br />Obi is a decent enough man and he has the best of intentions, but he gets in way over his head,  bringing tragedy down upon himself and disgrace to his village.  His situation, as portrayed by  Achebe--caught between the traditions and expectations of his village on the one hand and the modern  ways and legal constraints of the West on the other--puts him in an untenable position, one where  something must give.  The title of the book comes from T. S.

At a time when most intellectuals and politicians had surrendered the ideological battle, or were  actively collaborating with the Soviet Union, it was Robert Conquest, in his epochal books The Great  Terror and Harvest of Sorrow, who demonstrated--in such a way that no truly open-minded person  could really doubt--that Russia's Communist regime was just as murderous as Hitler and the Nazis, if  not more so.  Though it is quickly being forgotten, Conquest's honest appraisal was extremely rare and  was greeted with almost uniform hostility.  Most academics after all are left-leaning and so hoped that  the Soviet experiment would eventually work out, while even politicians of the Right, like Richard  Nixon, were so intent on pursuing diplomacy with the Russians that they did not care to hear about  such bitter truths.<br />This book then, presenting more of a series of essays than a sustained thesis, allows Conquest to revisit  old turf and settle old scores, place the murderous ideologies of the century in some perspective and  finally to draw some conclusions and make some suggestions.  His main points about the ideologies are  very straightforward :<br />  The huge catastrophes of our era have been inflicted by human beings driven by certain thoughts.<br />and<br />  The book's general theme, then, is that any concept given anything like absolute status becomes not  a guide to action but an abstraction whose imposition on reality reveals an incompatibility, as  engineers say of parts that do not fit, by main force, and even then ineffectively or ruinously.<br />His discussion of why these ideologies appeal to intellectuals offers one of the most chilling quotations  you're likely to find :<br />  ...if it could be shown that humanity would live happily ever after if the Jews were exterminated,  there could be no good reason not to proceed with their extermination.  -Bertrand Russell<br />This attitude was unfortunately reflective of too many intellectuals who believed that the application of  reason to man's affairs would necessarily yield utopian results, regardless of short term consequences. Conquests arguments on these points have been put better elsewhere by other authors (see for instance,  The True Believer : Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (1951)(Eric Hoffer  1902-1983)<br />(Grade: A) and The Road to Serfdom (1944)(F. A. [Friedrich August von] Hayek 1899-1992)  (Grade: A+), but you can't really begrudge him the opportunity to sum up what he's learned.<br />It's in the final section of the book that Conquest really piqued my interest.  There he suggests ways to  avoid a repeat of the Ravaged Century, particularly by resurrecting Winston Churchill's old vision of a  unified English-Speaking World :<br />  Generally speaking, closer integration of the (in the main) English-speaking countries, can create a  center of power attractive to the other countries with a democratic tradition and form the basis of a  yet broader political unity in the longer run.  And this in turn could eventually be the foundation  for a full unity of a democratized world.<br />The starting point for this grand alliance would be for Britain to bail out of the European Union and  join NAFTA, a recognition that England is less European than it is democratic and capitalist.<br />I am less sanguine than Mr. Conquest about future steps which he envisions duplicating the American  Federal System on a larger scale, with the US, Australia, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, etc. as  &quot;united states.&quot;  But even he cautions that the federal institutions of such an &quot;Association&quot; would have  to be pretty weak just to gain acceptance from Americans.  Despite some misgivings, the core idea  here is really compelling.  Moreover, especially if the Tories return to power in Britain, the initial  steps are entirely doable.  In fact, the Tories could run on a NAFTA instead of EU platform and  probably do quite well.<br />The world can never repay the debt it owes to Robert Conquest and the other lonely voices who never  lost sight of the central fact that the Soviet Union was, to quote another of the voices, &quot;the focus of  evil in the Modern World.&quot;  This book, though somewhat unfocused and a bit overfamiliar, allows  him to share the lessons of a lifetime and to offer some interesting ideas about the future.

For the most part, our enjoyment of these  books hinges almost exclusively on our interest in the event that propelled the author into the public  spotlight, however briefly.  Don Foster is a Shakespeare scholar, Vassar professor, and literary sleuth,  and his book, Author Unknown, is a glorious exception to this rule.<br />Though his name may be unfamiliar, many--at least the political junkies among us--will remember the  dramatic moment when Mr. Foster unmasked Joe Klein as the man behind the nom de plume  &quot;Anonymous&quot; and the author of Primary Colors.  Foster, at the behest of New York Magazine, had  compared the text of the novel to the writings of a number of the most likely suspects and had found so  many stylistic and linguistic similarities between the book and Klein's column--including heavy use of  adverbs, hyper hyphenation, Capitalization of Concepts, an obsession with race and a certain  uncomfortableness about sexual orientation issues--that he was able to confidently pronounce Klein the  author.  Despite Klein's fearsome denials and some brief second thoughts, Foster stuck to his guns and  eventually Klein was forced to acknowledge authorship, when handwriting samples also tied him to the  manuscript.<br />This book contains plenty of fascinating details about the techniques Foster uses and the nitty gritty of  the investigation, but the basics of the &quot;Anonymous&quot; caper are fairly well known, in at least general  form, and, though this episode alone would probably suffice to sell the book, it is the other cases that  Foster deals with that really make the book worthwhile.  He starts with the work that brought him to  the attention of New York's editors, when as a graduate student he managed to use his investigatory  skills to attribute a poem to William Shakespeare.  This story provides a truly sublime moment when,  having submitted his dissertation to Oxford University Press as a book proposal, he was turned down  and received instead two anonymous critiques of his work--apparently standard practice calls for  scholars to read and judge submissions anonymously--wherein both authors stated that it is not possible  to use only the internal evidence in written works to attribute authorship.  However, Foster then  proceeded to compare the critiques to the writings of various prominent Shakespeare scholars and was  able to discern precisely who had written them--perhaps predictably, neither expert saw the humor in  this this, but the reader surely will.  Despite these early rejections, Foster was eventually credited with  having discovered a new Shakespeare poem and write-ups in The New York Times and elsewhere  established him as perhaps the first, certainly the leading, practitioner of literary forensics.<br />Later sections of the book deal with : his subsequent involvement in the JonBenet Ramsey and  Unabomber cases; a demonstration that Thomas Pynchon was not the secret author behind a series of  vituperative letters to the editor of Mendocino County, California newspapers, signed by Wanda  Tinasky, the Fort Bragg Bag Lady; a tantalizing rumination on who may have really written the  infamous &quot;Talking Points&quot; of Lewinsky fame; and a final chapter which pretty much demolishes the  idea that Clement Moore wrote the beloved poem, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas.  The Talking  Points discussion is especially interesting, mostly because it remains such a galling mystery,  particularly for those of us who wanted Bill Clinton led out of the White House in an orange jumper  and handcuffs.  Foster is not able to pin the deed on a specific culprit, but does show conclusively that  the memo was not the exclusive work of Monica and her pal, Linda Tripp, and points at clues in the  language and legal sophistication of at least the first page of the memo that seem to indicate it was most  likely the work of one of a handful of lawyers in the Clinton inner circle.  Recall that Clinton himself  is a lawyer, but Foster does not pursue him directly, focussing instead on Bob Bennett, Bruce Lindsey  and Vernon Jordan.  He is hindered here by not having access to much written work by these three  men, but it would be fun to see what he could do with more evidence.<br />My only criticism, and it's a mild one, is that there's a little too much &quot;gee has my life become hectic&quot;  and &quot;what have I gotten myself into.&quot;  This is self indulgent, almost self pitying, and is at odds with  the genuine excitement he obviously brings to his work.  He does such a good job getting us caught up  in the thrill of the chase that his complaints about the hectic lifestyle the work entails fall on deaf ears.  These quibbles aside, the book was one of the more pleasant surprises to come over the transom here in  quite awhile.  This one is highly recommended.<br />GRADE : At  the memo was not the exclusive work of Monica and her pal, Linda Tripp, and points at clues in the  language and legal sophistication of at least the first page of the memo that seem to indicate it was most  likely the work of one of a handful of lawyers in the Clinton inner circle.

The new island drifts first towards America then South; at one point it rotates; but for the most part it just seems to be adrift.  Of course, the oddest thing about all this is that the book was published just as Spain and Portugal were formally joining the European Community and officially ending their years in the wilderness.<br />If Mr. Saramago has a coherent point here it was too nuanced for one as literal as I.

There have been many, mostly feeble, attempts to answer this question.  The most disastrous have, of course, been Darwinism--we exist to propagate the species, Hegelianism/Marxism--there are World Historical forces in control and Existentialism--existence is it's own point.  Saul Bellow seems to fall into a loose grouping with the Existentialists and The Adventures of Augie March is essentially an existentialist tract.  In a return to the style of the picaresque novels (i.e., Tom Jones), Augie March bobs along from Chicago to Mexico to Europe to an open boat in the Atlantic, experiencing life and meeting a variety of characters--observing without judging, experiencing without changing, seeking without finding.  Critics claim that this is a life affirming book; but life does not need to be affirmed, it simply is.  One recalls Dr. Johnson's response to the argument that the material world does not exist: he kicked a rock and said, &quot;I refute it thus!&quot;  The task before us as human beings is to find or bring meaning to life.  Great literature illuminates the human condition and reveals truths which help us discern this meaning.  Bellow fails in this basic task and does so at mindnumbing length.<br />GRADE: F	2000-11-02

Naipaul chronicles the descent of a Central African nation (Zaire) from postColonial disruption to New African corruption to utter chaos &amp; hooliganism.  All of these events are seen through the eyes of Salim, a Muslim Indian shopkeeper, whose store is in a town where, decades earlier, the faltering Arabs first confronted the ascendant Europeans. Just as the Europeans replaced the Arabs, indigenous movements are now sending the Europeans packing.<br />Salim is in an especially tenuous position, neither European nor African, he is trapped in the collision between African Nationalism and a heritage of European colonialism.  He is not an apologist for the West, but he does acknowledge that:<br />  Those of us who had been in that part of Africa before the Europeans had never lied about  ourselves. Not because we were more moral. We didn't lie because we never assessed ourselves  and didn't think there was anything for us to lie about; we were people who simply did what we did.  But the Europeans could do one thing and say something quite different; and they could act in this  way because they had an idea of what they owed to their civilization. It was their great  advantage over us. The Europeans wanted gold and slaves, like everybody else; but at the same  time they wanted statues put up to themselves as people who had done good things for the slaves.  Being an intelligent and energetic people, at the peak of their powers, they could express both sides  of their civilization; and they got both the slaves and the statues.<br />On the other hand, he describes the natives as malins, humans who treat other humans as prey.  Meanwhile Salim and his people are merely trying to get along: &quot;My wish was not to be good,...but to make good.&quot;<br />His willingness to look honestly at the deterioration of conditions in former colonies when the Europeans withdraw and his criticism of the natives of these lands has earned Naipaul the enmity of many.  But his novels offer an important corrective to the romantic view of the Third World and they were especially useful at the time, the 60's &amp; 70's, when they were published.<br />This is not a Top 100 novel (Modern Library List), but it's a decent one.<br />GRADE: Cnds has earned Naipaul the enmity of many.

His thesis is that America is  torn between two competing &amp; diametrically opposed impulses.  On the one hand, we want to be a  Shining City on a Hill, uncontaminated by contact with the outside world.  But on the other hand we  long to bring freedom, democracy, etc. to other nations.<br />The reasons for this dichotomy have never been presented with more power than they are in Heart of  Darkness.  It is the story of how the Imperial impulse--bringing civilization to the savages--corrupts the bringers.<br />Marlow, a steam boat pilot, sets off upriver in Africa to find Kurtz, an ivory trader who has gone native. Along the way, he finds a pamphlet that Kurtz wrote about the civilizing mission of the White man, which ends with the postscript &quot;Exterminate all the brutes!&quot;  When, Marlow finds the mortally ill Kurtz, in a camp surrounded by pikes with human heads mounted on them, he has stopped trading for ivory &amp; has instead taken to raiding villages &amp; taking it by brute force.  He has abandoned civilized norms and has adopted the methods of the natives.<br />Kurtz final words to Marlow are &quot;The horror.  The horror.&quot;  When Marlow returns to Europe he meets Kurtz fiance &amp; when she begs to know if Kurtz spoke of her, Marlow tells her that he died with her name on his lips. It is not just the savagery of the natives that is corrupting, it is the very notion of a civilizing mission.  Conrad is wrong, of course, but it's a great book.<br />GRADE: A	2000-11-02

It seems more fitting for a tale where a young English schoolteacher, Nicholas Urfe, goes to a Greek Island and meets a mysterious millionaire/piano teacher/war criminal/sorceror/collaborator/charlatan/etc., named Conchis, who teaches Urfe about himself by drawing him into a game where all is illusion.  Of course, both Conchis and Fowles are playing mind games here and while their manipulations are entertaining at times, they are ultimately simply annoying.  Moreover, unlike God, they seem to have little of value to convey to us and what they do have to say gets muddled in the obfuscations of the plot.<br />Fowles himself is mystified by the success and continuing popularity of the book.  But in an epoch where people take the philosophy of the Star Wars movies seriously, it is hardly surprising that a pretentious literary effort draws much the same empty headed devotion.<br />It's an okay book, with some very fine writing and moments of real dramatic tension and mystery, but it could use some serious editing, much plot tightening and some philosophical clarity.<br />GRADE: C	2000-11-02

But its Main Street is the continuation of Main Streets  everywhere. The story would be the same in Ohio or Montana,  in Kansas or Kentucky or Illinois, and not very differently  would it be told Up York State or in the Carolina Hills.  -Author's Preface<br />As all of us know, Sinclair Lewis was the great liberal critic of small town, bourgeois Middle America.  His novels demonstrated the small-minded conformity of the conservative folk of the MidWest, content to wallow in smug self-righteous ignorance.  This at least is the common understanding of Lewis.  But I found this book to be somewhat more nuanced.  The satire extends not just to the townfolk of Gopher Prairie, but to the city folk of Washington too.  Thus, when Carol Kennicott decides to return home, I did not see it as necessarily a surrender.  She notes several times that noone in Washington cares about her, the way the townspeople back in Minnesota did.  This seems to me to be the fundamental dilemma that Lewis sets up:  Main Street requires conformity to tradition and social standards in exchange for recognition, respect and love from one's neighbors, the City offers freedom and individuality precisely because there's noone there who cares about you or what you do.<br />Instead of flatly condemning small town America, Lewis seems to have had a more limited goal in mind.  When Carol is planning to return, a leader of the suffragettes tells her that she need not heroically assault Gopher Prairie and the attitudes she finds there:<br />  There's one attack you can make on it, perhaps the only kind that accomplishes much anywhere:  you can keep on looking at one thing after another in your home and church and bank, and ask why  it is, and who first laid down the law that it had to be that way.  If enough of us do this impolitely  enough, then we'll become civilized in merely twenty thousand years or so, instead of having to wait  the two hundred thousand years that my cynical anthropologist friends allow.  ...Easy, pleasant,  lucrative home-work for wives: asking people to define their jobs.  That's the most dangerous  doctrine I know!<br />Dangerous it may be, but it is also pretty conservative, shockingly so for a Socialist.  What is spelled out there is a program that would allow for gradual reform of egregious wrongs, without tossing out what is good.  It is the exact opposite of what actually occurred over the next 70 years of New Deal hegemony.  This excellent message is obscured somewhat because the section that takes place in the city is pretty brief, while the town life portion goes on interminably.  But it does redeem the book, which I sort of expected to just be just a hysterical screed.  It's too bad that there's not more focus on this aspect of the novel.  It offers constructive criticism and gives the book some universal significance, rescuing it from just being a slice of a life at a limited time and place in our history.<br />Grade: Ce law that it had to be that way.

I feel about Salman Rushdie's first big book roughly the same way I feel about Indian food.  The food features a fascinating melange of spices, smells and textures, but I have no desire to consume it.  Nor do I particularly comprehend the attraction of the cuisine of a dirt poor Third World country with more dietary taboos than you can shake a sitar at and, while heavy spicing is a perfectly logical substitute for substance, at the end of the meal one longs to ask: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;.  Similarly,  in his novel, Rushdie combines his signature Magical Realist style and the actual historical background of India since Independence with the family history of the Sinai's to create a bewildering mess of a novel that is heavy on Bombay slang.  The language is pungent but indecipherable and the story is ambitious but confusing.  The linguistic pyrotechnics and luxuriant prose have displaced the meat of the story.<br />I actually believe that India offers  a unique opportunity to the author of today.  With the end of the Cold War and peace in the Middle East, South Africa and Northern Ireland, many of the settings that offered built in tension have disappeared.  India, however, remains a corrupt political state, is rife with ethnic tension and is nearly at war with both Pakistan and China.  There are so many latent plot lines that it would seem an irresistible setting and I very much enjoyed books like Rohinton Mistry's  Such a Long Journey and Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy (1993).  But, both are much more traditional, Western-style novels.  As is usually the case, the injection of magical realism into Rushdie's story ends up detracting from his tale rather than enhancing it.  The effort to create an Indian, or postcolonial, style did not work for me; a straightforward narrative, stripped of hocus pocus gimmickry, would have been much more enjoyable.<br />GRADE: C-	2000-11-02

As they spend more time together, Sophie gradually unfolds the story of her horrifying experiences in the Holocaust.<br />Stingo speaks with a distinctive voice and the choice Sophie is compelled to make is horrible and compelling, but somehow we never really connect with the three main characters.  Stingo comes across like a more serious version of a Woody Allen character--all unfulfilled sexual longing.  Nathan is so abusive that it's hard to see why Stingo is attracted to him (Sophie's attraction to him is reducible to mere masochism).  And Sophie is ultimately little more than a beautiful victim, first of her father, then of the Nazis, then of Nathan.<br />Pop-psych Interlude:  I'm sure it's occured to others that William Styron is the living embodiment of White Liberal Guilt.

One can only point out that all of these characters meet horrific fates, so maybe he's still got some issues to work through  with his therapist.<br />Grade: C	2000-11-02

Cain, along with Chandler and Hammett, really created the literary genre which would be turned into film noir. One revels in the image of Cain, who was himself an insurance adjustor, sitting at his desk dreaming up the perfect murders which form the basis of his novels.<br />In Postman, Frank Chambers interrupts his cross country rambling at a diner owned by Nick Papadakis after getting one look at Nick's wife, Cora. That first look conveys everything we need to know about the relationship between men and women in noir fiction, &quot;Except for the shape, she really wasn't any raving beauty, but she had a sulky look to her, and her lips stuck out in a way that made me want to mash them in for her.&quot;<br />Frank and Cora become lovers and are soon plotting to murder Nick, but find they don't trust one another and &quot;Love, once you get fear in it, turns to hate.&quot;<br />As the novel closes, Frank is on Death Row. One of the other inmates theorizes about the sub-conscious and how he's not responsible for his crime. But Frank says, &quot;To hell with the sub-conscious. I don't believe it. It's just a lot of hooey, that this guy thought up so he could fool the judge. You know what you're doing and you do it.&quot; This is another quintessential element of American noir--the &quot;heroes&quot; are not victims of the psyche; they are knowing actors &amp; when the time inevitably comes to pay for their sins, they accept punishment stoically, knowing that they deserve it for their evil deeds. There's an important lesson here, as we close the Century which saw a sustained assault  by the partisans of Freud and Marx upon the notion of personal responsibility.<br />To quote the immortal philosopher Baretta, &quot;don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.&quot;<br />GRADE: A	2000-11-02

And Slim  shallave some.<br />Uh-huh, fascinating stuff, eh?<br />Here's the cover blurb from the version I have, as written by Joseph Campbell, one of the folks who tried popularizing Joyce:<br />  Finnegan's Wake is a mighty allegory of the fall and redemption of mankind...a compound fabe,  symphony, and nightmare...Its mechanics resemble those of a dream, a dream which has freed the  author from the necesssities of common logic and has enabled him to compress all periods of  history, all phases of individual and racial development, into a circular design, of which every part is  beginning, middle and end.<br />Let me just point out that &quot;freed...from...logic&quot;, is code for &quot;it doesn't make sense&quot;. And the blather about circular design reflects something I recall reading about how Joyce intended the reader to be able to read the book from any point and in any direction with equal felicity. It worked; it's idiotic from  start to finish.<br />So what's the end result? Well, you remember that old example that's used to demonstrate the magnitude of infinity--if you set down infinty monkeys in front of infinity typewriters (I suppose now it's computers) eventually one of them types Hamlet.

While social mores dictate that she make a match with the more proper gentleman, Cecil Vyse, who is courting her, Lucy is torn between passion and propriety. Ultimately, she chooses Emerson who reminds her of &quot;a room with a view&quot; offering her a new vista on life.<br />This is a comedy of manners, as we can see from the subtlety of characters names: Vyse represents the constricted vice-like society, Emerson is &quot;nature&quot; a la Ralph Waldo &amp; Thoureau. And, of course, the lesson we learn is that the entrenched morals of society should be thrown away in favor of passion &amp; the natural. This common theme of the top 100--we've seen it in Edith Wharton, &amp; others--seems even more moronic as we close the century, the elevation of passion over morality has never looked worse than in the wake of the Clinton scandals. Further, as we now know, this admonition must be read in light of Forster's own homosexuality, adding an altogether different cast to the call for discarding social convention.<br />If you feel compelled to read Forster, I advise sticking to A Passage to India.<br />GRADE: D	2000-11-02

Lyman Ward is a 58 year old professional historian. He's suffered through the loss of a leg and the flight of his wife of 25 years &amp; now he's returned to his family homestead, Zodiac Cottage in Grass Valley, CA to write the biography of his grandmother, Susan Burling Ward, a minor author and artist of the West. She came from the East in 1876 to be with her new husband Oliver Ward, a mining engineer. Lyman proceeds to chronicle their lives until disaster strikes the couple &amp; essentially ends the marriage, although they stay together for another 50 years, having attained an &quot;Angle of Repose&quot;.<br />I had two big problems with this book, which is essentially a dandified Michener. The first is that I hated Lyman Ward, the narrator. Perhaps it is a function of writing in the early seventies, the great wasteland in American culture, but the lives, concerns and conversations of Lyman and the people around him are excruciating. The second problem was that I thought Susan Burling Ward deserved to be horsewhipped. She spends the first part of the book madly in love with one of her girlfriends and then falls in love with her husband's best friend. Meanwhile, she meddles in Oliver's career choices repeatedly &amp; then agonizes over the dead ends that career runs into time and again.<br />I'd give this one an extremely qualified recommendation &amp; suspect it would appeal more to women.<br />GRADE: C	2000-11-02

We see this property=conservatism maxim playing itself out today, in 401k's.  The fact that the great bulk of the population is invested and doing well has served to insulate President Clinton from virtually every degenerate or incompetent thing he's done.  As long as the market's cranking, everyone just wants to leave things as they are--no change, please.<br />What does this have to do with Mr. Biswas?<br />Well, V.S. Naipaul's novel is profoundly conservative in just this way.  At a time when many in the Third World, &amp; the First &amp; Second for that matter, were demanding that wealth be redistributed and the West pay them reparations for colonialism, he gives us Mr. Biswas a decent hard-working Trinidadian of Indian decent, whose sole motivating dream in life is to own his own home.

Bennett had an epiphany and realized that the old woman too must have once been young and pretty and full of life.  He decided there and then to write a novel that would chart the arc of such a woman's life.  The result is this naturalist classic, by one of the last truly 19th Century writers.  But it begs the question: is an author a humanist or a condescending phallus when it comes as a revelation to him that old unattractive women may have lead full and interesting lives?<br />In the event, Bennett wrote a book about two sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines, daughters of a shopkeeper in the Five Towns where he set all of his novels.  Sophia, who leads the more exciting life, runs off to Paris with a louse of a husband, but Constance, modeled on the old woman, stays in Bursley and marries the assistant in the shop.  Late in life, the two women are reunited, dying within a brief time of one another.  The version of the book that I read has an Introduction by JB Priestley, wherein he says:<br />  If we think first of the two sisters as young girls, then this tale is grim, a tragedy; but if we think  first (as Bennett did) of the apparently dull old women and then realise that they marched through  this epic, then the tale is a romance.<br />Now, I'm not the most sensitive flower in the garden, but I just find that totally offensive.  It seems to me that it is a fair representation of the attitude of the intelligentsia throughout history:  pity the poor hoi polloi, what dull lives they must lead.  But it defies logic to assume that the great mass of mankind leads lives of desparation and disappointment.  It would seem that the contrary is probably true; most folks probably lead perfectly satisfactory lives, even if they are just working 9 to 5 and then going bowling or watching wrestling and NASCAR on TV.  We may not all pursue the same highbrow interests as the authors and artists of the world, but there's no reason to assume that we're any less happy with our lives.  And even the fat old chick pumping coins into a video poker machine may be as happy as a pig in slop.<br />I had honestly never even heard of Bennett until there was a piece on him in the New York Times Book Review a couple of years ago.  I've since made an effort to read his stuff and I find much to like in his work.  But the attitude that gave birth to this book infects his narrative voice and I found it pretty annoying.<br />GRADE: CWe may not all pursue the same highbrow interests as the authors and artists of the world, but there's no reason to assume that we're any less happy with our lives.

So what's interesting is to realize how many of his later faults were presaged here, in this bloated, unpleasant, faux macho, homoerotic, self-indulgent mess of a book.  The Naked and the Dead is little more than war viewed through the eyes of one sexually conflicted Jewish man, who didn't enjoy his wartime service much.  The opposite of a universal tale, it's sort of Hemingway with anti-Semitism thrown into the mix.  It is necessarily an anti-War novel, because any time you shrink a human exercise down to a sufficiently limited scope, it appears senseless.  But, even, or especially, with it's totally Mailercentric view of the War, it opens up several interesting avenues for discussion.<br />The first, and most general, point is that the very narrowness of the view presented in the novel is  symptomatic of the worst tendencies of modern literature.  It is of course the ultimate in 20th Century  Romantic Relativistic Freudian Individualism to view WWII through the prism of your own  experiences; as if the war was only important because of what you went through.  But it is also fundamentally dishonest; great events matter because they are huge and affect the many, not because they affect Norman Mailer.  There is nothing in the book about why the men are fighting or why the  island is important.  The war is simply Mailer's vehicle for getting this group of men together and deploring their interactions.  It could be set in virtually any male milieu.<br />By shrinking the experience of WWII down to the daily tedium that this platoon faces, the War  inevitably seems senseless, brutal and soul deadening.  The enemy after all remains distant, mysterious,  dare one say--inscrutable.  The real enemies that the men face, as far as Mailer is concerned, are the racism, anti-Semitism and mere inhumanity of fellow soldiers and the arbitrary seeming orders of superiors.  But if we were to pull the camera angle back, we would see that these men are engaged in what virtually every thinking human would consider to be a just war.  The event is actually defined by the aims of the war, not by the unpleasantness of GI life.  It is only by holding such a tight focus on the unit that Mailer can portray the War as senseless.  Of course, in this narrow a focus all war appears senseless.  Men fight and die for patches of earth or unnamed hills, following inane orders,  in every war.  From the perspective of the dead of Antietam, the Civil War was meaningless.  But Mailer is either unwilling or unable to consider the big picture and place the battle in context, for, to do so, would reveal the pettiness of his concerns.<br />The second point, which flows from this portrayal and from the near universal judgment that this was  the best novel about the War, is that it is mere generational bigotry that has allowed us to glorify the WWII generation and vilify the Viet Nam generation. ...<br />My generation was lucky, I guess.  We never had a war of our own (other than the general Cold War) and I doubt that we would have produced a literature that was any more edifying.  But I think it's high time that we bring the hammer down on the chest beating and self congratulations of the WWII generation.

Catcher in the Rye, as everyone hopefully knows, is the story of one weekend in the life of Holden Caulfield. Holden has just failed out of another Prep School and, after getting in a fight with his roomate, flees to New York City, where he holes up in a hotel rather than go home to face his parents.<br />As his story unfolds, we learn that he had a beloved younger brother who died of leukemia and Holden has been extremely troubled since then.  In one of the more memorable images in literature, Holden explains that he sees himself as &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; (he has misremembered a Robert Burns lyric as &quot;if a body catch a body coming through the rye&quot;).  He imagines a flock of little kids running through a field of rye along a cliff precipice and he is poised at the edge trying to catch them before they fall.  But Holden isn't just troubled by the Mortality of others, as one character tells him, he is spiritually troubled by the morality of others.  He rages against all of the &quot;phonies&quot; and &quot;mean people&quot; he meets.  What could make a young man feel more ineffectual and helpless than taking responsibilty for the mortality &amp; morality of the whole human race?<br />This story of a young man coming of age, trying to understand the human failings of those around him, is one of the great works of Literature &amp; should rank much higher on the Modern Library list.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-31

The moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable.&quot;<br />This seems to me to be profoundly wrong.  Ethics and morality are a function of the political system that society's adopt, not vice versa. Golding would have done well to read Hobbes' Leviathan.  Hobbes makes the much more convincing case that for man in the state of Nature, life was &quot;Nasty, brutish and short&quot;.  So man traded off a certain amount of autonomy to a central authority in exchange for protection from other men. Morality then flows from the political structures that men adopt.<br />Take an example on a smaller scale: the morality of informing.  In criminal enterprises the informer (rat, squealer, snitch) is immoral because the enterprise depends on secrecy--i.e., the Mafia , Revolutionary/Terrorist groups, crooked cops,  the Clinton White House--and anyone who parts the veil of secrecy is demonized, because informing endangers the entire structure.  In the normal run of life we are fairly conflicted about informing, we don't honor the informer (Sammy &quot;The Bull&quot; Gravano, Whittaker Chambers, Frank Serpico, Linda Tripp) but we do seek to protect them from retalliation by their bosses via whistleblower laws.  While  in totalitarian societies informing against those who oppose the state (even if it's your parents) is a heroic act.  Golding would have us believe that these differences are the result of the innate ethical natures of the members of the societies.  In fact, it is the agreed upon structure of the societies that determines what behavior is accepted as ethical.<br />GRADE: C	2000-10-31

It is my personal pick for the Great American Novel and I would place it just below Orwell on the Top 100 of the 20th Century list.<br />Most will be familiar with it's Huey Long derived tale of the rise and fall of populist politician Willie Stark.  Jack Burden, the narrator, is a newspaperman who hitches himself to Stark's rising star.  Eventually, Stark calls on Burden to get the goods on the lilly white Judge Irwin, the surrogate father of Jack's youth and a man of widely acknowledged rectitude:<br />  Jack: But suppose there isn't anything to find.<br />  Stark: There is always something.<br />  Jack: Maybe not on the Judge.<br />  Stark: Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the  stink to the diddie to the stench of the shroud.  There is always something.<br />Sure enough, Jack digs until he finds the ugly truth and unleashes a series of  shocking revelations and tragic deaths.<br />I'm sure that this must seem too cynical to some, but it is actually a marvelous retelling of the essential Puritan democratic myth that informs the American system.  Politics after all is nothing but a system of choices about how some men will wield power over other men.  All of the choices are bad, but the  alternative--the lawless State of Nature--is worse and so we try to make the best bad choices possible.  But we must remain ever vigilant against those who wield power over us &amp; noone is more dangerous than the populist or the do-gooder who cloaks himself in the mantle of the Good &amp; the Right.  FDR and his New Deal come hand in glove with interring the Japanese Americans and packing the Supreme  Court.  LBJ and Civil Rights are accompanied by profound personal corruption and Viet Nam.  And, of course, when you elect the purely evil, you get Detente + Watergate or the Health Care Plan + Monica + Chinagate, etc.  The only politicians who are even mildly trustworthy are those who renounce the very powers of government--George Washington, William McKinley, Calvin Coolidge, Eisenhower &amp; Reagan.<br />This is a book that John Adams would have loved and you will too.<br />GRADE: A++ Monica + Chinagate, etc.  The only politicians who are even mildly trustworthy are those who renounce the very powers of government--George Washington, William McKinley, Calvin Coolidge, Eisenhower &amp; Reagan. <br />This is a book that John Adams would have loved and you will too.    <br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-31

I get that  sometimes with writers, particularly those who I haven't read as they were writing.  Like I finally just  read a book by Eric Hoffer, whose stuff I'd always seen around but who I continually confused with  Eric Fromm, Eric Erickson and a couple other guys who were popular in the '60s.  Similarly, I've  never been able to keep Joan Didion, Nora Ephron and Joyce Carol Oates straight, but I was sure I  didn't like at least a couple of them and had no desire to sort through and figure out which.  What a  revelation then to pick up a book of Joan Didion's essays; they are terrific.<br />The first collection, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, opens with an introduction by the author, in  which she says that the title is a reference to Yeats's great poem The Second Coming, with which  many of the essays share an apocalyptic vision :<br />  'Slouching Towards Bethlehem' is also the title of one piece in the book, and that piece, which  derived from some time spent in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, was for me both the  most imperative of all these pieces to write and the only one that made me despondent after it was  printed.  It was the first time I had dealt directly and flatly with the evidence of atomization, the  proof that things fall apart<br />It is this realization that animates both this collection and The White Album (which should really be  read together), the sense that American society was splintering in the 60s and 70s and that traditional  moral and cultural restraints could no longer hold it together.  Whether she's writing about a  sensational murder or profiling California celebrities, discussing student demonstrations, the Black  Panthers or the Women's Movement, or portraying her own physical and emotional problems, the  consistent theme is one of the breakdown of the social order, or of the American psyche.  But there's  also a strong subtext which shows that the center, though embattled, really is holding; it is the  margins, both at the upper and the lower ends of the social spectrum which are falling apart.  The real  danger lies in the middle's loss of confidence in it's own beliefs, a crisis of faith.<br />The disintegration at the bottom of the social scale is most clear in her reporting on crime, drug  culture and the inanity of youth, racial and gender politics.  But she lays the blame squarely, and  fairly, at the feet of Middle America, as here when she's discussing the failure to provide any  guidance to America's youth :<br />  At some point between 1945 and 1967 we had somehow neglected to tell these children the rules of  the game we happened to be playing . . .  These were children who grew up cut loose from the web  of cousins and great-aunts and family doctors and lifelong neighbors who had traditionally  suggested and enforced the society's values. ... They are less in rebellion against society than  ignorant of it, able only to feed back certain of its most publicized self-doubts, Vietnam,  Saran-Wrap, diet pills, the Bomb.<br />  They feed back exactly what is given to them.  Because they do not believe in words--words are  for 'typeheads,' Chester Anderson tells them, and a thought which needs words is just one more of  those ego trips--their only proficient vocabulary is in the society's platitudes.  As it happens I am  still committed to the idea that the ability to think for one's self depends upon one's mastery of the  language, and I am not optimistic about children who will settle for saying, to indicate that their  mother and father do not live together, that they come from 'a broken home.'  They are sixteen,  fifteen, fourteen years old, younger all the time, an army of children waiting to be given the  words.<br />Now, normally, those words would come from parents, clergy, schools, etc., but self doubt inhibited  their willingness to impart them, and kept them from enunciating these ideals to the rest of society.<br />The reason for their timidity is made apparent in a batch of essays which celebrate middle class good  sense and sensibilities while contrasting them to the snobbishness and self-righteousness of elites.  In  essays on John Wayne, Howard Hughes, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Reagan-built California  Governor's Mansion, Didion shows how out of touch intellectual opinion is with these symbols that  the rest of us find so appealing.  Here she is on the mansion :<br />  A guard sleeps at night in the old mansion, which has been condemned as a dwelling by the state  fire marshal.  It costs about $85,000 a year to keep guards at the new official residence.  Meanwhile, the current governor of California, Edmund G. Brown, Jr., sleeps on a mattress on the  floor in the famous apartment for which he pays $275 a month out of his own $49,1000 annual  salary.  This has considerable and potent symbolic value, as do the two empty houses themselves,  most particularly the house the Reagans built on the river.  It is a great point around the Capitol  these days to have 'never seen' the house on the river.  The governor himself has 'never seen' it.  The governor's press secretary, Elisabeth Coleman, has 'never seen' it.  The governor's chief of  staff, Gray Davis, admits to having seen it, but only once, when 'Mary McGrory wanted to see it.'  This unseen house on the river is, Jerry Brown has said, 'not my style.'<br />  As a matter of fact this is precisely the point about the house on the river--the house is not Jerry  Browne's style, not Mary McGrory's style, not our style--and it is a point which presents a certain  problem, since the house so clearly is the style not only of Jerry Brown's predecessor but of  millions of Jerry Brown's constituents.  Words are chosen carefully.  Reasonable objections are  framed.  One hears about how the house is too far from the Capitol, too far from the Legislature.  One hears about the folly of running such a lavish establishment for an unmarried governor and  one  hears about the governor's temperamental austerity.  One hears every possible reason for not living  in the house except the one that counts : it is the kind of house that has a wet bar in the living  room.  It is the kind of house in which one does not live, but there is no way to say this without  getting into touchy and evanescent and finally inadmissible questions of taste, and ultimately of  class.  I have seldom seen a house so evocative of the unspeakable.<br />In such a situation, where the proclivities of the opinion-making class had diverged so far from the  preferences of the middle class, it would have taken an inordinate amount of courage for middle  America to hold it's ground, even more so in the face of the concurrent rebellions by youth, feminists  and people of color, all of them attacking traditional tastes, beliefs, and mores.<br />The piece though that most dramatically illustrates this dichotomy and demonstrates just how  embattled was Middle America and how arrogant were the intellectuals is the quite devastating,  Bureaucrats.  In straightforward fashion, all the more effective because understated, she relates the  efforts of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to, in the words of it's director :  &quot;pry John Q. Public out of his car,&quot; by creating Diamond or HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) lanes on  the thruways, beginning with the Santa Monica :<br />  Of course this political decision was in the name of the greater good, was in the interests of  'environmental improvement' and 'conservation of resources,' but even there the figures had about  them a certain Caltrans opacity.  The Santa Monica normally carried 240,000 cars and trucks every  day.  These 240,000 cars and trucks normally carried 260,000 people.  What Caltrans described as  its ultimate goal on the Santa Monica was to carry the same 260,000 people, 'but in 7,800 fewer, or  232,200 vehicles.'  The figure '232,200' had a visionary precision to it that not automatically create  confidence, especially since the only effect so far had been to disrupt traffic throughout the Los  Angeles basin, triple the number of daily accidents on the Santa Monica, prompt the instigation of  two lawsuits against Caltrans, and cause large numbers of Los Angeles County residents to behave,  most uncharacteristically, as an ignited and conscious proletariat.<br />She goes on to show that the bureaucrats at Caltrans are bent on reengineering the behavior of  motorists regardless of their resistance and of the disastrous results.  The coup de grace is delivered in  the final sentence : &quot;Yesterday plans were announced to extend the Diamond Lanes to other freeways  at a cost of $42,500,000.&quot;  It's one of the finest essays I've ever read, exposing the arrogance of little  men with too much power.<br />Throughout, the two books are filled with terrific stuff like this and more memorable sentences than  you can count.  The only weak spots are the predominantly personal essays, which I could have done  withous too far from the Capitol, too far from the Legislature.

Powell, mainly through the narration of Nicholas Jenkins, unfolds the stories of a group of upper class Brits from the 20's to the 70's as the England of Empire and Class and social form expires and yields to the new England.  While not necessarily defending the older England, Powell clearly dislikes the society that replaced it and the series is basically an acerbic deconstruction of the modern world.<br />I've read several of the novels and for purposes of this review read The Acceptance World.  Set in the years 1931 to 1933, we follow Jenkins as he meets for tea, drinks, dinner or the weekend with a number of the recurring characters from the series.  Finally as Kenneth Widmerpool, the social climbing mediocrity who represents Britain's New Man, is giving an interminable speech, Le Bas, their old Oxford don, collapses into his dinner plate with a stroke, perhaps brought on by the speech.  This finale is one of the set pieces for which the series is best loved. The Acceptance World of the title refers specifically to the business of dealing in debt, but more generally it refers to the characters accepting that their lives are not following the ideal courses that they charted in youth and their acceptance of this disappointment.<br />Frankly, the epic scope and understated plotting of these novels require more indulgence than this reader is prepared to offer.  I have enjoyed the entries I've read, but in a very minor way.  I'm afraid I share in all of the criticisms that one of the Websites below defends against.  The books are too English, too class conscious, too nuanced, the characters are acid portraits based on actual people with whom I am totally unfamiliar and all of these factors combine to leave me feeling that I'm just barely missing the joke.

I admire the writing and understand the cult status that the work has achieved, but life is too short and reading time too precious to work my way through all 12 volumes.<br />I suggest sampling the series, but warn you not to anticipate finishing it.<br />GRADE: B-against.

Love you see is a mutual thing.  It requires interrelations and bonds which are anathema to the wholly nihilistic, individualistic and selfish intellectual elites of the Modern era.  What in the end does Freudianism consist of, other than an attack on the foundations of the family?<br />Passion on the other hand, requires nothing from anyone other than the individual.  It does not require that the object of one's desires reciprocate.  The individual, whole in himself, can experience passion.<br />Lawrence, in these novels (Rainbow &amp; Women in Love) and others, tried to explore new alternatives to the traditional Western structures of marriage, family and Christianity.  He hoped to recreate humans and human relations in new forms, unbound by tradition and reason.<br />It is for this fundamental attack on the great accomplishments of Western Civilization that his books should have been banned, not because of some wildly melodramatic sex scenes in the haystacks.<br />GRADE: F	2000-10-31

I loved Brave New World, but it seems that I misunderstood one of it's main points.  Huxley apparently opposed science and meant the book to be as much a warning about a science dominated future, as a warning about authoritarian government in general.  From this perspective, Brave New World is nearly a crypto-Luddite tract.<br />Huxley was generally something of a sensualist and an anti-rationalist.  Like most men before him, he was troubled by the body/mind dichotomy that uniquely confronts humankind.  But unlike the great thinkers who have been responsible for nearly all human progress, he (along with his friend DH Lawrence) came down on the side of the body and sensory experience, rejecting reason, science, religion, etc..  It seems to me that to choose the body over the mind is to reject the divine spark in man in favor of the animal instinct.<br />Point Counter Point, a voluminous, wildly overpopulated, completely outdated roman a clef is meant to vindicate his viewpoint, but is so sarcastic as to undermine even his own arguments.  Despite some funny set pieces and some interesting ideas, I'd not recommend this book and may have to revisit Brave New World.<br />GRADE: D	2000-10-31

Washington summoned  them and prepared to read a letter responding to the concerns that had been raised in an anonymous  letter.  in a piece of brilliant stagecraft, the vain General removed a pair of eyeglasses, which most  had never seen him wear, and said : &quot;Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I  have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country.&quot;  The coup was over.  This  much of the story is pretty well known, but Bruns reproduces here the letter that Washington  proceeded to read and which is almost as affecting as the gesture.<br />The Munson Report<br />To me the most heartbreaking document is the excerpted Munson Report, an intelligence document  prepared at FDR's request which makes it clear that Japanese Americans posed no threat to national  security in the pending war with Japan.  This dark moment in history is made all the more troubling  in light of this document.<br />Operation Unthinkable<br />This is the most thought provoking document, an excerpt from a secret war plan commissioned by  Winston Churchill to study the feasibility of invading the USSR at the conclusion of WWII.  Of  history's many lost opportunities, perhaps none were more costly in terms of human life, economic  stagnation, and moral quiescence than the failure to pursue this course.<br />The book is replete with such moments and memoranda, many of them equally compelling to  consider.  The introductory essays are informative but brief, setting the stage for the document to  followwithout burying the reader in unnecessary detail.  It is great fun and subversively informative.<br />GRADE : Arief, setting the stage for the document to  follow without burying the reader in unnecessary detail.

The boys, as most everyone knows from the terrific movie, soon stumble upon more adventure than they had anticipated and find themselves at war with several denizens of the backwoods country. These four men are forced to confront the central question at the core of the male being:  how would I react if I was confronted by physical danger and heroism was required.<br />Ed, the narrator and hero of the book, finds upon returning home that his entire life has improved.  By performing well during the crisis, he has built up a personal reservoir of confidence that he continues to draw upon.<br />Contrast Ed with the men of the Clinton/Gingrich generation.  Their general avoidance of service in Viet Nam has resulted in a twisting of their souls.  Given the opportunity to answer the central question about themselves, they ducked.  In a phrase coined by C.S. Lewis, they are &quot;men without chests&quot;.  Hollow at their cores, they have no proven personal strength to draw upon and collapse inwards upon themselves.<br />This is a great book and perhaps one of the last truly male works of literature that will be admitted to the canon.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-31

I believe it is very nearly perfect, and may well belong in the Top 10.<br />The Private Eye (like the Old West gunslinger before him) is a quintessential American hero.  A lone man, bound by an incorruptible personal code of morals, who gets drawn into tangled situations where only he can restore order.  As the archetypal P.I. novel then, The Maltese Falcon owns a special place in American Literature.<br />One interesting sidelight to the novel is to compare the final confrontation between Sam Spade &amp; Brigid O'Shaughnessy to Hammett's own showdown with HUAC in the 1950's.

At a time when authors like James Joyce were using denser &amp; denser thickets of language &amp; increasingly nonlinear plots to obfuscate the novel, Hemingway brought a direct reportorial style to his writing.  But, to what end?<br />This is the story of a loose group of American &amp; British expatriates in Paris &amp; Spain in the 1920's.  They lounge about cafes, drinking wine, bickering, brawling &amp; lusting after Lady Bret Ashley.  None of the characters are at all likable and nothing really happens.<br />Without delving too deeply into psychobabble, the most interesting facet of the book is that the first person narrator, Jake Barnes, was emasculated during WWI.  Considering the absurdly self-destructive ends to which Hemingway went to prove that he was macho &amp; the widespread perception that his suicide was fueled by self-loathing over his repressed homosexuality, the book is perhaps most interesting as an artifact of his tortured psyche.<br />GRADE: C-	2000-10-31

Right off the bat it just seems extraordinarily unlikely that you'll get a calm, balanced and non-dogmatic presentation of the issues.  It's a pleasant surprise then that Richard Manning, despite a sleight over reliance on Ehrlichean &quot;sky-is-falling&quot; rhetoric, is able, at least to my non-expert eyes, to offer a full and fair look at some of the current debates surrounding the future of agriculture generally and, more specifically, the issues that arise out of the need to boost crop yields in developing countries to meet the rising food demands of their constantly increasing populations.<br />Manning's basic premise is that the original Green Revolution--largely a product of improved fertilizers, pesticides, and breeding techniques--has hit a wall and is no longer providing the types of increases in production which have characterized the past thirty or forty years.  Nor is there any readily apparent successor Revolution to step in and provide the necessary increases.  He proposes that the answer to pending food supply problems then will not come from such a top down revolution but rather will have to rely on myriad local solutions :<br />  The Green Revolution at its most fundamental level treated all the world the same, but the lessons  being learned in agriculture now are local.  A practice, a variety, a people, and a crop endure in a  place because selection has finely tuned them to survival.  They have evolved along with local  conditions, and the path to a sustainable future requires some respect for the results of that process.<br />In the ensuing chapters he surveys the results of studies in nine regions--Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, India, several parts of China, Chile, Brazil, Mexico and Peru--on unfamiliar but traditional crops like sorghum, tef, milpa, sweet potatoes, and the like, which suggest that these foodstuffs are uniquely suited to these areas and are more appropriate than Western grains.  The work being done by scientists in these countries therefore focusses on how to maximize the yields of these native plants, but their work tends to be understaffed, underfunded and unappreciated.  The nations after all tend to be poor, their best minds tend to emigrate to the industrialized West and there's not much interest on the part of powerful multinational corporations in these marginal crops.  This is where McKnight and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) come in, providing seed money (quite literally) to keep local scientists working to improve local crops.<br />The best section of the book is Manning's rational and dispassionate discussion of bioengineering.  Though he maintains a healthy respect for the dangers that genetic manipulation of crops could conceivably pose, he also recognizes that it is already happening on a significant scale and is going to continue regardless of hysteria like that which greets export of genetically modified American goods to Europe, that it is absolutely vital to the daunting task of boosting yields, and that it simply does not much differ from the routine ways in which man has always intervened in plant and animal breeding.  Sadly missing from most of the heated argument that you hear about genetically modified foods is the simple common sense and undeniable truth of the following :<br />  For at least ten thousand years humans have been engaged in selection, an artificial pressure on  breeding populations.  All the forms of life we call domestic have a genetic makeup, a code, that is  artificial as a result of this pressure.<br />Manning does not issue a blanket approval for all bioengineering, suggesting that more limited manipulations may be more effective anyway, and are certainly less risky, but he comes down squarely in favor of using the techniques, particularly to help improve these native crops.<br />In the end, Manning suggests that the examples he's looked at are united by a common thread : that local knowledge, conditions, and customs should play a much more central role than they have in guiding agricultural development in Third World nations, and that they have started to, thanks in large part to the efforts of NGOs like McKnight :<br />  All this suggests the real breakdown of the linear model.  Information and knowledge will no  longer flow from top to bottom but will originate in and reverberate through every part of the  system.  Information flows among researchers and farmers that in the end could have them working  on a common ground, a common ground of knowledge.  It may be difficult to define what will  replace Green Revolution methods, but this concept lies at its core.<br />In fact, this too is a revolution, as he says, an &quot;information revolution.&quot;  Moreover, it echoes the writings of folks like F. A. Hayek on political economies, and the idea that centralized, bureaucratic, top-down decision making can not possibly be effective, precisely because it can not take into account all of the unique individual and local information bubbling up from the bottom.<br />It's become sort of commonplace these days to depict the ascent of Free Markets and Global Trade as a threat to the developing world, to the environment, and to local customs.  But the push for free market capitalism is based on the hard won consensus that such a system offers the most efficient means of structuring an economy, that only such an open system allows for the free flow of ideas and information which is a predicate for intelligent decision making.  It is really exciting to see that a similar recognition may be emerging in the field of agriculture and in those developing countries, that not only are free markets not necessarily a threat to native ways of life but that such a decentralized, fluid, information dependent, ruthlessly efficient system may be the best means of preserving local knowledge and traditions.<br />GRADE : B+ve anyway, and are certainly less risky, but he comes down squarely in favor of using the techniques, particularly to help improve these native crops. <br />In the end, Manning suggests that the examples he's looked at are united by a common thread : that local knowledge, conditions, and customs should play a much more central role than they have in guiding agricultural development in Third World nations, and that they have started to, thanks in large part to the efforts of NGOs like McKnight : <br />    All this suggests the real breakdown of the linear model.

I do still maintain that it is not the equal of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre in the &quot;great American novel of Mexico&quot; category.<br />The Consul, Geoffrey Firmin, is an alcoholic living in Mexico.  He has divorced his wife, Yvonne, who had an affair with his half-brother Hugh, a journalist &amp; supporter of the Communists in the Spanish Civil War.  Now Hugh &amp; Yvonne have returned, separately, to visit him on the Day of the Dead.  By the end of the day, the Consul has been murdered by Mexican security forces who think he's a  spy.<br />I'm still not sure I understand what Lowry's trying to say, but I'll take a stab at it.  It seems that the Consul represents the West, paralyzed by neuroses and unable or unwilling to come to the aid of those in need.  The volcano of the title would seem to represent the specter of Fascism that looms on the horizon.  This image of impending doom recurs in the movie at the local theater, Los Manos De Orlac or The Hands of Orlac--the classic film about a pianist who receives a murderers hands in a transplant.  Orlac would be Germany, a great culture turned murderous.<br />Lowry does a great job of rendering this sense of doom and, in the Consul, gives us one of the great fictional portraits of a drunk in all of literature.

Sadly most of them only have one.  This certainly appears to be the case for Fitzgerald.  The Great Gatsby, while flawed, is nonetheless a great novel.  Gatsby is a tragic figure motivated by a self destructive pursuit of his vision of the American dream.  Dr. Dick Diver, the central character of Tender is the Night, on the other hand, is naught but a dissipated wastrel.  As his wife, who he met while he was working as a psychiatrist &amp; she was interred in an asylum, gains mental stability &amp; some kind of shaky personal wholeness, he descends into drink &amp; carnality &amp; ends the novel roaming from town to town practicing medicine briefly before moving on.  Diver is the kind of insipid navel gazing character who has plagued the Century's fiction.<br />Tom Wolfe, touring in support of his new novel, has launched himself on a jeremiad against the Modern novel &amp; novelist.  His central point is that novelists need to stop looking inward and look without.  He's saying, Go out into America &amp; tell the wonderful stories that you find there.  There are wonderful stories, waiting to be told, but our greatest novelists are cloistered in Universities, Manhattan apartments, etc., picking at the scabs on their own psyches &amp; the vomiting forth their internal monologues.

Along the way, the tavern owning married man who stole to fund their escape to Chicago, kills himself after being abandoned by Carrie and ending up in Bowery flophouses.  Meanwhile, An American Tragedy tells the story, based on a sensational true crime, of a young man who is working his way towards the American dream and refuses to let a pregnant former girlfriend stand in the way of his chance for romance with a wealthy woman.  He takes the slattern out in a boat &amp; clobbers her, but is tried and executed for the crime.<br />It is an open secret that even critics who admire Dreiser, consider him to be a horrible writer technically.  American Tragedy has been called &quot;the worst-written great novel in the world&quot; and the otherwise loathsome Garrison Keillor has an amusing column about how bad he finds Sister Carrie on rereading it.  His books have all the literary grace of the phone book.<br />Thus, his reputation rests solely on the agreement of Left wing critics with his hatred of American capitalism.

Graves makes the case that these very infirmities, and the underestimation of his abilities by all but Augustus, enabled him to survive the mayhem and bloodshed of the reigns of his predecessors.  Upon Caligula's assassination, Claudius was elevated to emperor almost as a joke, but he turned out to be one of the most capable of the Roman Emperors.<br />Graves tells the story of the years leading up to his ascension to the throne with great wit and verve in this archetypal historical novel.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-30

When Humbert goes looking for a place to live, he finds a rooming house where the landlady's daughter, Dolores Haze, is the living embodiment of his lost love.  Of course, she's only twelve, but our intrepid hero plots to marry &amp; murder her mother &amp; so gain access to his &quot;Lolita&quot;.  When an accident removes the mother, Humbert Humbert &amp; Lolita set off cross country on a motel jumping jaunt, until finally Lolita escapes with another pedophile.  Humbert now plans the revenge which lands him in prison, where he writes this memoir.<br />Since it's initial publication (abroad because no American firm would touch it), Lolita has been plagued by scandal.  Indeed a recent movie version could not find a distributor.  And this is entirely appropriate.  It should be difficult to publish a work about pedophilia.  However, this is undeniably a great work and deserves to be widely read by adults.  Humbert Humbert's obsessive passion may be for young girls but Nabokov's is for the English language.  The verbal pyrotechnics, puns,  word plays, etc. are brilliant &amp; the language is luxuriant (at some point I'll have to read an annotated version, because it's impossible to catch all the allusions).<br />Having read the book several years ago, I listened to the Audio version this time.  It is read by Jeremy Irons and, while there are no obscenities in the book, his reading is so sensual &amp; his enjoyment of the language is so evident, that I would urge folks to give it a listen (one caveat, it is 11.5 hours long).<br />GRADE:  A	2000-10-30

However, Miss Quested is overwhelmed by the caves &amp; accuses Aziz of attacking her &amp; for all their good intentions, they are shown to be just as incapable of understanding Indians as the worst of their fellow Brits.<br />This is certainly the best of Forster's novels.  The clash of cultures makes for interesting reading.  However, after a century of decolonization and independence, it's legitimate to ask whether places like India are better off today, as independent nations, than they were in 1900, as colonies.  Forster  makes the point that the English will never understand the Indians &amp; can never be friends with them, but will Hindus ever understand Moslems &amp; can they ever be friends?  More importantly, even if the English never could befriend the Indians, wasn't their governance, at least, enlightened &amp; constructive?  Whereas, the Hindus who feel actual hatred towards the Moslems (&amp; vice versa) have governed in a backward and destructive manner?  Should ethnicity be the deciding factor in who governs a country or are governing principles (democracy, capitalism, religious tolerance) more important to the welfare of the population?<br />It seems to me that Forster &amp; his ilk bet on ethnicity &amp; events have shown them to be catastrophically mistaken.<br />GRADE: B	2000-10-30

He more than anyone else established and propounded the fundamentals of the  modern swing.  Though some of the material is inevitably dated--younger folks may not even know  what the heck a spoon is--most of what he says is just as helpful today as it was over fifty years ago.<br />This book is especially appropriate for beginners and there are three essential bits of advice that are all  someone really needs to know when they pick up a club for the first time :<br />  (1) The basis of the golf swing is a good grip.  A good grip &quot;enables the two hands to act as a single  unit.&quot;<br />  (2) &quot;The first movement in the downswing is the turning of the left hip to the left.  Forget about  your arms, hands, shoulders and club at that moment and start the hips turning, led by the left  hip.&quot;<br />  (3) &quot;My advice to the beginning golfer is to go ahead and hit the ball as hard as he can right from  the start.  He will be wild for a time.  That's only natural.  Later on he can straighten out his  hooks and slices with minor alterations to his swing.  But if he doesn't learn to hit the ball  hard right at the start, he will never be able to get distance without a major overhauling,  because his speed and timing setup will be something less than his full power.&quot;<br />That's it; that's really all you need to get started.  It's a terrific little book, complete with quaint  illustrations of a little golfer in pleated slacks and a sweater demonstrating the lessons.  Of course,  there is one more more thing that Hogan emphasized and no book will help you with; if you want to  improve you have to practice, a lot.<br />GRADE : B+	2000-10-26

This story  originally appeared in three installments in Liberty magazine in April, 1933.  He had met Lillian  Hellman two years earlier, with whom he was to share a rather troubled but now mythical romance  (and an unrepentant and slavish enthusiasm for Joseph Stalin) for the rest of his life.  The next year he  published his final novel, The Thin Man, and then fell silent with a writer's block that ranks second  only to that of Joseph Mitchell in legend.<br />Woman in the Dark is certainly not a novel; at best it's a novella and even then it feels more like the  outline for a longer work.  The woman of the title is Luise Fischer, the Swiss-born kept woman of a  wealthy thug named Kane Robson.  Having walked out on him one evening, she twists her ankle and  stops for help at cottage occupied by Brazil, a phlegmatic ex-con, who once killed a man in a barroom  brawl.  When Robson shows up with a henchmen to demand that Luise come back to him, Brazil  punches the other man who bangs his head, perhaps fatally, on the fireplace mantle.  Now both Brazil  and Luise have a reason to take it on the lam :<br />  He emptied his glass and went to the front door, where he made a pretense of looking out at the  night.<br />  As he turned from the door he caught her expression, though she hastily put the frown off her face.  His smile, voice were mockingly apologetic : 'I can't help it.  They had me away for a while--in  prison, I mean--and it did that to me.  I've got to keep making sure I'm not locked in.'  His smile  became more twisted.  'There's a name for it--claustrophobia--and that doesn't make it any better.'<br />  'I am sorry,' she said.  'Was it--very long ago?'<br />  'Plenty long ago when I went in,' he said dryly, 'but only a few weeks ago that I got out.  That's  what I came up here for--to try to get myself straightened out, see how I stood, what I wanted to  do.'<br />  'And?' she said softly.<br />  'And what? Have I found out where I stand, what I want to do?  I don't know.'  He was standing in  front of her, hands in pockets, glowering down at her.  'I suppose I've just been waiting for  something to turn up, something I could take as a sign which way I was to go.  Well, what turned  up was you.  That's good enough.  I'll go along with you.'<br />So much for the set up, in the two sections that follow, the police track them down and Brazil is shot,  but the ending suggests that everything may work out for the two who have by now fallen in love.<br />It's tempting to read the story autobiographically.  Two interesting and seemingly dynamic characters  meet up and embark on an exciting though fairly implausible love affair, but then their story just kind  of tails off into ambiguous and unconvincing anticlimax.  Despite periodic flashes of Hammett's  trademark hardboiled style, the book is generally disappointing.  The conclusion of the story in  particular is a far cry from the great final scene of The Maltese Falcon.  Ultimately, the book is  interesting chiefly as an indicator of where Hammett was headed just before he stopped writing, but if  it's an accurate indication, we didn't miss much.<br />GRADE : Co     do.'<br />    'And?' she said softly.<br />    'And what?

You could hear the collective gasp and feel the pull of the intake of breath as thousands of  folks who pride themselves on being &quot;in the know&quot; turned to one another and asked, across a table laid  with grapefruit halves and bran cereal,, &quot;Was I supposed to know who Isaiah Berlin was?  I've never  heard of him.&quot;  The answer is that there was no real reason most of us would have heard of him,  though we'd likely read a couple of his book reviews.  He was after all a philosopher who never  produced a magnum opus summarizing his worldview.  His reputation really rested on a couple of  amusing anecdotes, one oft-cited essay, The Hedgehog and the Fox, and on his talents as a  conversationalist, which would obviously only have been known to an elite few.  Oddly enough, he  has experienced a significant revival of interest since his death, but he is basically still just known for  this essay.<br />If, like me, you finally forced yourself to read War and Peace and were simply mystified by several of  the historic and battle scenes, this essay is a godsend.  Though many critics, and would would assume  almost all readers, have tended to just ignore these sections of the book, Berlin examines them in light  of Tolstoy's philosophy of history and makes a compelling case that Tolstoy intended the action of  these scenes to be confusing.  As Berlin uses the fox and hedgehog analogy, a hedgehog is an author  who has a unified vision which he follows in his writing (&quot;...a single, universal, organising principle in  terms of which alone all that they are and say has significance...&quot;) , a fox has no central vision nor  organizing principle; his writings are varied, even contradictory.  Berlin argues that Tolstoy was a fox  who wanted to be a hedgehog, that he longed for a central idea to organize around, but so distrusted  the capacity of human reason to discern such an idea, that he ended up knocking down what he saw as  faulty ideas, without ever settling on one of his own.<br />According to Berlin, in War and Peace, Tolstoy used the chaotic swirl of events to dispel a &quot;great  illusion&quot; : &quot;that individuals can, by the use of their own resources, understand and control the course  of events.&quot;  Or as he puts it later, Tolstoy perceived a &quot;central tragedy&quot; of human life :<br />  ...if only men would learn how little the cleverest and most gifted among them can control, how  little they can know of all the multitude of factors the orderly movement of which is the history of  the world...<br />This idea is strikingly similar to the argument that F. A. Hayek made almost a century later in his  great book The Road to Serfdom, though Hayek made it in opposition to centralized government  planning.  Tolstoy's earlier development of this theme makes him a pivotal figure in the critique of  reason and a much more significant figure than I'd ever realized in the history of conservative thought.<br />I'd liked War and Peace more than I expected to when I first read it--despite not grasping what he was  about in these sections of the book--and I'm quite anxious to reread it now in light of Berlin's really  enlightening analysis.  I've no idea how to judge the rest of Berlin's work or how he ranks as a  philosopher, but you can't ask more of literary criticism than that it explain murky bits, that it  engender or rekindle interest in an otherwise musty-seeming work, and that it take a potentially dated  book and make us realize that it is still relevant.  This essay succeeds on all those levels.  In this  instance at least, Isaiah Berlin warrants his hefty reputation.<br />GRADE : A+ings are varied, even contradictory.

One reason is specific; it offers a devastating  critique of urban planning.  The other is more general; it lies in the degree to which this amateur's  analysis calls into question the very concepts of bureaucratic expertise and centralized planning.  On  cities specifically, Jacobs was an early and prescient voice warning that what was being billed as urban  renewal--big housing projects, highway building, creation of business districts, etc.--was actually  destroying neighborhoods and creating more problems than it was solving. Subsequent events of the  past forty years have certainly borne out her argument that the planners were killing cities.  An apt  companion piece for her book would be The Power Broker : Robert Moses and the Fall of New York  by Robert Caro, wherein the author demonstrates in detail that these plans came to be more about the  exercise of power by the civil &quot;servants&quot; than about actually helping city dwellers.  The high rise  housing projects that blight our urban landscape stand as eloquent testimony to the fact that, regardless  of their original intentions, the bureaucrats of the Great Society wasted billions of dollars pursuing  disastrous policies and left only ruin in their wake.<br />Of course, Urban Renewal was just one aspect of the liberal do-gooders sustained assault on the poor  families of our great cities.  Similarly interventionist--and equally deleterious in their effect--were  ideas like Welfare, the Sexual Revolution, and so on...  The entire panoply of supposedly benevolent  government programs of the post-Depression era all had presumably unintended, though entirely  foreseeable, adverse consequences for their supposed beneficiaries.  Jacobs' thesis is easily expanded, as  indeed she has in successive books, to encompass all centralized government planning.  The alternative  vision she offers, of more organic development (basically allowing Free Market forces to function), is  certainly the prevailing notion today, at least rhetorically.  It is surely no coincidence that the rebirth  of cities like New York has come about under the leadership of Republican mayors.  But one need  only look at New York's schools to realize that the bureaucrats are fighting a tenacious rearguard  action.  Virtually the entire book could be applied to today's education system.<br />One surefire sign that this book still strikes a nerve among the liberal elites is its inexcusable exclusion  from the Modern Library Top 100 List.  Of course, that list includes instead the insipid  The City in  History (1961) (Lewis Mumford 1895-1990)(see Orrin's review).  Mumford's book is mostly self  evident historical analysis, devoid of ideas.  In sharp contrast, Jacobs' book is all idea, timeless ideas,  and a slap in the face of the modern statists of the Left and the enormous hubris which convinces them  that they should make our decisions for us.<br />One thing I especially love about books like Jacobs', is that they remind folks that conservatives aren't  merely reactionaries--sniping at noble but misguided social policies only after they've failed--but  actually foresaw the catastrophic effect that Big Government would have on our lives and warned  against it at the time.  On the other hand, it's kind of frightening how much of this book remains  timely and germane today; but in recent years it does at least seem as if Jacobs' vision is finally  winning.

In order to achieve the first goal, Hofstadter uses a trick familiar to every gadfly and pickle  barrel orator; he simply argues the opposite of the accepted wisdom.  Thus, his chapter headings  include: I. The Founding Fathers: an Age of Realism; II. Thomas Jefferson: the Aristocrat as  Democrat; III. Andrew Jackson and the Rise of Liberal Capitalism; IX. Theodore Roosevelt: the  Conservative as Progressive; and X. Woodrow Wilson: the Conservative as Liberal.  Get it?  The  Founders weren't idealists but realists.  The liberal icons of the Left--Jefferson, Jackson, TR and  Wilson--were actually all conservatives.  This continues right up to FDR, who despite a brief and  half-hearted break from this past, refuses to go along with the most farsighted and sweeping aspects of  the New Deal.  As this version of American history unfolds, we're treated to a kind of grand  conspiracy theory whereby the leaders of the Left turn out to be wolves in sheep's clothing, secretly  supporting the system and channeling discontent back into heterodoxy.<br />Then comes the hammer blow, because do you know what all of these schemers and dupes, either  naively or maliciously, preached and believed in?  As Hofstadter scornfully informs us, all of them  believed in individualism, free markets, competition, equality of opportunity and all of those hoary old  shibboleths that had been totally discredited by 1948 and would surely never again see the light of day:<br />  The things Hoover believed in--efficiency, enterprise, opportunity, individualism, substantial  laissez-faire, personal success, material welfare--were all in the dominant American tradition.  The  ideas he represented--ideas that to so many people made him seem hateful or ridiculous after  1929--were precisely the same ideas that in the remoter past of the nineteenth century and the more  immediate past of the New Era had an almost irresistible lure for the majority of Americans.  In the  language of Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln these ideas had been fresh and invigorating; in the  language of Herbert Hoover they seemed stale and oppressive.  It is a significant fact that in the  crisis of the thirties the man who represented these conceptions found himself unable even to  communicate himself and what he stood for.  Almost overnight his essential beliefs had become  outlandish and unintelligible.  The victim of his faith in the power of capitalism to survive and  prosper without gigantic government props, Hoover was the last presidential spokesman of the  hallowed doctrines of laissez-faire liberalism, and his departure from Washington marked the decline  of a great tradition.<br />Hofstadter later asks of Hoover: &quot;Could he have seriously believed that free enterprise might be  restored to the postwar world?&quot;  This is what we mean when we speak of hubris in Greek tragedy.  It  would be amusing if Hofstadter and his ilk had not proceeded to do so much harm with their  abandonment of American values and traditions and their eager embrace of a centralized planned  economy.  It's really too bad that he died so young.  I'd have liked to have seen him explain away the  rise of Ronald Reagan and the Opportunity Society.<br />This book is profoundly awful.  It is wrong in its major theses, informed by a really snide tone of self  congratulation and, in celebrating the worst moment in the history of American governance (the rise of  the Social Welfare State), fails to reckon with the fundamental tension in American history (indeed in  all of human history), the ongoing struggle between the forces of freedom and the advocates of  security.

It is that simple.  -Annie Dillard<br />This Pulitzer Prize-winning book, describing Dillard's observations during one year at Tinker Creek in  Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, is consciously modeled on Thoureau's Walden, which was the subject  of her Masters thesis.  The essays collected here first appeared in everything from Harper's and The  Atlantic to The Christian Science Monitor and Sports Illustrated.  This variety of publications suggests  something of the variety of ideas and topics that Dillard addresses, but only suggests.  Dillard is  something of a polymath, has described herself as spiritually promiscuous and reads voraciously.  As a  result, the events that she sees trigger wide ranging dissertations on a myriad of topics from Sufism to  the Eskimos.<br />However, there is one unifying theme, Dillard's attempt to understand God and why life for some  requires violent death for others.  She was recovering from a severe bout of pneumonia at the time she  wrote the book, and a sense of mortality suffuses every page.  Ultimately, she seems to have  determined that the beauty to be found in Nature is ample compensation for the pain and suffering that  accompany it, if only we open ourselves to that beauty.<br />The book is framed by an admonition:<br />  The mockingbird took a single step into the air and dropped.  His wings were still folded against his  sides as though he were singing from a limb and not falling, accelerating thirty-two feet per second,  through empty air.  Just a breath before he would have been dashed to the ground, he unfurled his  wings with exact, deliberate care, revealing the broad bars of white, spread his elegant,  white-banded tail, and so floated onto the grass.  I had just rounded a corner when his insouciant  step caught my eye; there was no one else in sight.  The fact of his free fall was like the old  philosophical conundrum about the tree that falls in the forest.  The answer must be, I think, that  beauty and grace are performed whether or not we will or sense them.  The least we can do is try  to be there.<br />and the following conclusion:<br />  I think that the dying pray at the last not 'please', but 'thank you', as a guest thanks his host at the  door.  Falling from airplanes the people are crying thank you, thank you, all down the air; and the  cold carriages draw up for them on the rocks.  Divinity is not playful.  The universe was not made  in jest but in solemn incomprehensible earnest.  By a power that is unfathomably secret, and holy,  and fleet.  There is nothing to be done about it, but ignore it, or see.  And then you walk fearlessly,  eating what you must, growing wherever you can, like the monk on the road who knows precisely  how vulnerable he is, who takes no comfort among death-forgetting men, and who carries his  vision of vastness and might around in his tunic like a live coal which neither burns nor warms him,  but with which he will not part.<br />By the end of this thoughtful, beautiful book, you are bound to agree with her conclusion.<br />GRADE: At rounded a corner when his insouciant     step caught my eye; there was no one else in sight.

There was that decade-long spasm when the media and the Left<br />convinced themselves that the Japanese had it all figured out.  So<br />there was this ridiculous craze in Japanese management techniques and<br />faux profound philosophical teachings.  Riding in on the crest of this<br />wave came A Book of Five Rings by one of the most revered warriors in<br />Japan's history, Miyamoto Musashi. Shinmen Musashi No Kami Fujiwara No<br />Genshin, aka Miyamoto Musashi, was orphaned by the age of seven and,<br />in order to earn his way in the world, became a swordsman, killing his<br />first man at the age of 13.  Eventually he fought some 60 duels<br />without ever being defeated.  By the end of his career, he had become<br />so expert and dominant that he would fight his opponents with nothing<br />but a stick.  Then in 1643, he retired to a contemplative seclusion in<br />a cave, where, just before his death. he wrote Go Rin No Sho (A Book<br />of Five Rings), a book of strategy addressed to his disciple Teruo<br />Nobuyuki.<br />The book is essentially a treatise on the Way of the<br />warrior, the strategy that should be employed in combat:<br /> It is said<br />the warrior's is the twofold Way of pen and sword, and he should have<br />a taste for both Ways. Even if a man has no natural ability he can be<br />a warrior by sticking assiduously to both divisions of the<br />Way. Generally speaking, the Way of the warrior is resolute acceptance<br />of death.  Although not only warriors but priests, women, peasants and<br />lowlier folk have been known to die readily in the cause of duty or<br />out of shame, this is a different thing. The warrior is different in<br />that studying the Way of strategy is based on overcoming men. By<br />victory gained in crossing swords with individuals, or enjoining<br />battle with large numbers, we can attain power and fame for ourselves<br />or for our lord. This is the virtue of strategy.<br />-----------<br /> This<br />is the Way for men who want to learn my strategy:<br /> Do not think<br />dishonestly.  The Way is in training.  Become acquainted with every<br />art.  Know the Ways of all professions.  Distinguish between gain and<br />loss in worldly matters.  Develop intuitive judgment and understanding<br />for everything.  Perceive those things which cannot be seen.  Pay<br />attention even to trifles.  Do nothing which is of no<br />use.<br />-----------<br /> To attain the Way of strategy as a warrior you<br />must study fully other martial arts and not deviate even a little from<br />the Way of the warrior. With your spirit settled, accumulate practice<br />day by day, and hour by hour. Polish the twofold spirit heart and<br />mind, and sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight. When your<br />spirit is not in the least clouded, when the clouds of bewilderment<br />clear away, there is the true void.<br /> Until you realise the true Way,<br />whether in Buddhism or in common sense, you may think that things are<br />correct and in order. However, if we look at things objectively, from<br />the viewpoint of laws of the world, we see various doctrines departing<br />from the true Way. Know well this spirit, and with forthrightness as<br />the foundation and the true spirit as the Way. Enact strategy broadly,<br />correctly and openly.<br /> Then you will come to think of things in a<br />wide sense and, taking the void as the Way, you will see the Way as<br />void.<br /> In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence,<br />principle has existence, the Way has existence, spirit is<br />nothingness.<br />Essentially, he has two extremely simple messages: be<br />humble and study what other people do.  This is a thoroughly Japanese<br />philosophy and the recipe for both their success in the 80's and their<br />demise in the 90's.  It is really tactical thinking more than it is<br />strategic.The Japanese system calls for precisely duplicating what<br />already exists, for learning what is already known.  The American<br />system demands innovation, the end run around the status quo. If you<br />want a metaphor for the two systems, two images come inescapably to<br />mind: David vs. Goliath and the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where<br />Indiana Jones shoots the enormous scimitar wielding Arab.  You can<br />just picture Musashi studying Goliath's moves or the Arab's<br />techniques, being reactive and imitative, while the American picks up<br />a gun or a sling and uses technological innovation to triumph.<br />Now<br />imagine if you will thousands of American businessmen riding the train<br />to work in the morning with this book clutched in their hands, eagerly<br />seeking clues to the Japanese economic miracle in the pages of a 17th<br />century sword fighting manual.  Pretty amusing, eh?  It's quite a<br />lovely little book and it is helpful for understanding the strengths<br />and limitations of the Japanese psyche.

Taken together, they have a weird kind of cryptototalitarian essence to them.<br />Thomas was a doctor and President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, who wrote a column  for the Journal of the American Medical Association.  His main concerns were music, language,  medicine and social behavior.  It is the cumulative effect of his pieces on social behavior that I found  frightening, his obsession with man as a social creature, a cog in a vast biological machine, as opposed  to an individual with free will.  In fact, part of his effort here is to make it clear that we're not even a  particularly significant cog or, at the very least, we're not that different from the other cogs.<br />This denigration of man in general and the individual in particular is pretty creepy stuff.  I couldn't  shake the feeling that Thomas's feelings on these matters would be shared by other doctors, like Dr.  Mengele and Dr. Kevorkian and Dr. Strangelove...  It just seems like the logic of his arguments also  underlies social planning and genetic engineering and euthanasia and a whole panoply of other bad  ideas that expert technicians have tried, or are trying, to foist upon us.<br />So I guess I sort of like the book, a little bit at a time.  Consumed in one big gulp, it's like peering into  the abyss; it offers the creepy fun of a Hannibal Lecter novel.<br />GRADE: C	2000-10-21

Like many of his contemporaries, much of his work is so obscure as to defy my  comprehension, but I do very much like what I understand in Pale Fire and Lolita, both of which made the Modern Library Top 100 Novels of the Century, and, of  course, to read him is to be exposed to an English language and a prose style that one little knew  existed.  So I am more than willing to acknowledge that he was a singular and immense talent.  It is  altogether fitting then that his memoirs too should be unique.<br />For the most part, Nabokov's mission here is literally to let his memory speak.  In so doing he recreates  late czarist Russia in loving, painstaking detail.  While to the best of my knowledge Nabokov was never  particularly identified with the anti-Communist &eacute;migr&eacute; movement, this book is its own kind of  indictment of the USSR.  The case it lays out is not the political or the economic one but the historical  and cultural one.  As he says:<br />  My old (since 1917) quarrel with the Soviet dictatorship is wholly unrelated to any question of  property.  My contempt for the &eacute;migr&eacute; who &quot;hates the Reds&quot; because they &quot;stole&quot; his money and  land is complete.

I don't believe in any form of racism. I don't believe in any  form of discrimination or segregation. I believe in Islam.  -Malcolm X<br />This was the final triumph of Malcolm X and the resolution that makes his life story into a classic  American tale: that in the end, he was able to move beyond the chrysalis of his racial hatred and  emerge an integrated enlightened being.  I'm sure most everyone has either read this book or seen Spike  Lee's excellent biopic, so we need not rehash the story too thoroughly.  Anyway, what matters are the  essentials.  Malcolm Little was a street punk when he was exposed to the Nation of Islam in prison.  This exposure, and the racial pride and anger that went with it, lead him to educate himself and get  involved with the Nation, where he became one of the most effective spokesmen and organizers.  A  confrontational proponent of racial separatism and black self-reliance, during the Civil Rights struggle,  he was yin to Martin Luther King's yang (or as I read somewhere, he was the Old Testament figure,  King was a figure from the New)--the constant reminder to whites that if King's nonviolent methods  failed to produce results, millions of righteously resentful young black men were waiting in the wings.  But, when Malcolm X made a hadj to Mecca, he discovered that there were Moslems of all races,  worshipping together peacefully, and that racism played no part in traditional Islam.  And so, in the  closing days of his life, he split from the Nation of Islam, adopting true Islamic beliefs and practices  and earning the enmity of Nation leaders who had him assassinated.  The arc of this story--from the  gutter, to a redemptive anger, to a cleansing understanding, to violent death--is like something from  Greek myth or Shakespeare, but it is a uniquely American tragedy.<br />I remember, as a kid, it was truly this easy: Martin Luther King was a good black guy; Malcolm X was  a bad black guy.  Upon reflection, I think that, even at his most inflammatory, Malcolm X defied this  easy categorization.  Who is to say that if he &amp; the Black Panthers hadn't been willing to hold out at  least the threat of violence, that whites would have moved to solve the Civil Rights issues as quickly  (relatively speaking) as they did?  More importantly, suppose the shoe was on the other foot, if you  were a young black man in 1960's America, whose message would have had more appeal, Martin's or  Malcolm's?<br />Actually, I have often wondered if black America might have been better served by a more violent tone  to the struggle.  Civil disobedience works precisely because it depends on the fundamental decency of  the oppressor and the certainty that he will yield.  But one result of the yielding party's giving in, is  that they can end up imbued with a sense of their own magnanimity  and sink into a deceptive mood of  self congratulation.  It might be better for the oppressed if there was more of a sense that they had  taken what was theirs, rather than that it was given to them.  I don't truly know.<br />Of course, the ultimate historic irony is that King, the peacemaker and accommodationist, was gunned  down by a racist white man, while Malcolm, the rabble rouser and confrontationalist, was killed by  rival blacks.  Reading his life story, it is hard not to believe that Malcolm X's career was really just  beginning.  It seems possible, even likely, that the inner peace he had found in the true Moslem religion  would have given him the moral and spiritually grounding which, combined with his oratorical gifts  and incisive intellect, might have lead him to accomplish great things.<br />Martin Luther King is justly celebrated; he is an easy hero for white America to embrace.  Malcolm X  is more problematic, he has sharper edges, but is no less deserving of admiration and honor.  His life  story belongs on the shelf with Benjamin Franklin and Booker T. Washington and Whittaker Chambers  and the other handful of great American autobiographies of self made men.<br />GRADE: A+er Chambers  and the other handful of great American autobiographies of self made men.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-21

But the child studies seem  dubious and the novelty of the even handed treatment of white Southerners is more of an indictment of  the prevailing intellectual hegemony of the 60's than a recommendation for this book in particular.<br />The pederastic preschool hysteria and recovered memory of Satanic rituals scare have amply  demonstrated (if Freud himself hadn't) that child psychologists/psychiatrists tend to find whatever they  expect to find when they head into child interviews.  So I think we have to question the validity of  Coles child research.<br />As for examining segregationists fairly, while it may have been revolutionary at the time Coles wrote,  we now live in a political culture that is so thoroughly racialized that the attitudes of segregationists  seems fairly unremarkable.  After all, how different is the Alabama parent of 1956 who wanted his kids  to go to an all white school from the 1990's inner city parent who wants her kids to go to a Black  Muslim school?  How different is the all white police force from the force that has to meet rigid racial  quotas?  Race is still the determinative factor in these distributions of power, we've just tweaked the  distributions a little.<br />I suppose Coles deserves some credit for undertaking such a project, which clearly ran counter to  popular perceptions of his day, but the most important conclusion in the book is the following:<br />  We all have our hates, but most of us do not get them involved with social and political issues to a  degree that becomes frantic and all consuming.  It is remarkable and almost frightening to see how  quickly a new generation can abandon the ruthlessly indoctrinated and maintained ideology of its  predecessor.  In the South, as segregationist customs have collapsed, most white people have  yielded to what they once said they could never accept.<br />Duh!  Whites fought tooth and claw to keep power in the South, but when they lost, they  accommodated to the new reality.<br />For some reason, race and sex have the capacity, like The Shadow, to cloud men's minds.  It should be,  and should have been, perfectly obvious that segregation was simply a political arrangement whereby  one group sought to maintain their own power.  Take power away from the Southern Whites, as the  Federal government did, and the need for a racial theory to support that power disappears.  (Books like  C. Vann Woodward's The Strange Career of Jim Crow (1955), had amply demonstrated the  fundamentally political background of segregation.)  But somehow the focus on race gave the whole  deal a peculiar resonance that made logical discussion nearly impossible and still affects our ability to  consider these matters, even with historical perspective.<br />A great book is waiting to be written about Desegregation; one that combines Woodward's  understanding of the historico-political roots of segregation, with the epic scope and mundane detail of  Taylor Branch's Parting the Waters, and with the intellectual honesty to examine the consequences of  race based solutions to race based problems that authors like Thomas Sowell and Charles Murray have  demonstrated.

Any notion that poor performance can't be remedied by the state is  a reversion to 19th-century attitudes, which I'm not prepared to accept.  -John Kenneth Galbraith to Mother Jones Magazine<br />  I have always felt a certain horror of political economists, since I heard one of them say that he  feared the famine of 1848 in Ireland would not kill more than a million people, and that would  scarcely be enough to do much good.  -Attrib. to Benjamin Jowett<br />Karl Marx was so profoundly wrong about so many issues and the Left has clung to his mistakes so  tenaciously that it is hard to decide which of his errors has had the most deleterious affect on human  affairs.  But I think it is safe to say that one of the worst ideas that he advocated, and which was  swallowed whole hog by liberals, was the idea that materialism is the supreme and dertiminative  motivation for human action.  Thus, he proposed, all of human existence boils down to the yearning to  live at a subsistence level, to be clothed, fed and housed.  Now I'm not saying that these things aren't  powerful motivators, I'd merely suggest that it is a failure of perspective to suggest that they are the be  all and end all of life.  Sure when you are hungry, feeding yourself seems like the purpose of life, but  to a drowning man there's no higher purpose than treading water.  Draw back from either of these  immediate situations and you see that the sufferer has too narrow a perspective.<br />However, Galbraith, who was apparently little more than a garden variety liberal with some height,  some panache and a facility with the language, wrote this entire book as a protest against the growth  economy, as if it is some kind of iron clad law that once men's most basic material desires are met, they  are fed, clothed and housed, then their fundamental purposes in life have been fulfilled.  He therefore  assumes that any material consumption beyond this base level is unnatural and is created somehow by  forces extrinsic to the individual and this consumption is a historical aberration that is being fostered by  erroneous attitudes and insidious advertising.  Moreover, since these mistaken or malicious factors can  not prevail for long, eventually people will realize that they are consuming beyond their needs and they  will stop.  Therefore, since man, in his view, does not need more than the minimal requirements of  existence and since modern society produces enough to satisfy these basic needs for every citizen, it is  foolish to keep our focus on expanding the economy.  Instead, we should concentrate on redistributing  what we have, yadda-yadda-yadda.<br />It is impossible to convey a sense of how incredibly misguided Galbraith's theories and his policy  prescriptions have proven.  Here are just a few inanities to ponder.  He is totally dismissive of the idea  that recipients of welfare benefits will be damaged by those very payments, scoffing at the notion that  they will become dependents of the state.  He concludes that, having reached the point where our needs  are taken care of, modern man will necessarily do one of three things: work fewer ours and days; or  work less hard; or fewer people will choose to work.  He states with great confidence that operating the  economy at capacity is per se inflationary, so he suggests that we build in a higher level of  unemployment.  He prattles on about the current imbalance between public and private production,  averring that public &quot;goods&quot; are being neglected in favor of production of private goods.  But what are  these public goods?  How about medicine, education, etc. ?  He is so obtuse, or so trapped in a Social  Welfare State mindset, that he can't even see that these too are fundamentally private goods. But  perhaps the most incredible aspect of the book is his treatment of the American economy as a closed  system; he never mentions our trading partners or the developing world and how they will impact the  &quot;Affluent Society&quot;.<br />So what we have here is a clarion call for the Great Society by a man who did not perceive, or foresee  such basic megatrends as: the globalization of the economy; the massive entry of women (who by his  definition would seem to have been fulfilled human beings when men were taking care of them ) into  the workforce; the information age; the inflationary effects of government spending; etc...<br />But folks like JFK and LBJ listened to him and we got the Great Society at an estimated cost of $5  Trillion.  Not coincidentally, the Federal Deficit today stands at $5.6 Trillion.  Finally, in the past few  years, we have begun to jettison Galbraithean social programs and we are running a full employment  economy with zero % inflation and the deficit will be gone in ten years.  I think we can reasonably  state that not only was this book spectacularly wrong, it actually did real damage to the United States  economy and virtually destroyed several generations of Americans who became addicted to Welfare.<br />This one may edge out Silent Spring for the worst choice on this list (Modern Library Top 100), but the inclusion of both provides  a valuable lesson about the invulnerability of liberal cant to contradictory facts and experience.<br />GRADE: Fnt of the American economy as a closed  system; he never mentions our trading partners or the developing world and how they will impact the  &quot;Affluent Society&quot;.<br />So what we have here is a clarion call for the Great Society by a man who did not perceive, or foresee  such basic megatrends as: the globalization of the economy; the massive entry of women (who by his  definition would seem to have been fulfilled human beings when men were taking care of them ) into  the workforce; the information age; the inflationary effects of government spending; etc...<br />But folks like JFK and LBJ listened to him and we got the Great Society at an estimated cost of $5  Trillion.

Graves spends the early portion of the  book lusting after a boarding school catamite.  This homosexuality, or at least a sadomasochistic  homoeroticism, is a consistent feature of the educational system of England's elites at the time and  amply demonstrates that rot had already beset British society.  Then he heads off to the war, despite his  personal opposition to it,  indicative of the fact that these were not young men who were dragooned  into the Service, by and large they were enthusiastic about the War.<br />The middle section of the book is taken up with the senselessness of the war itself and of life in the  trenches.  But there is something intrinsically tedious to reading about tedium.  And the attempt to  indict the stupidity of the officers who were running the war falls flat in light of John Keegan's superb  explication of their actions in his recent book The First World War (see review).<br />The final section of the book deals with his marriage to a socialist, feminist, nutcase and his halting  attempts to complete a degree and get started in business.  Finally, with all of these burdens piling up,  he shucks it and heads off to Egypt and then Majorca, wishing &quot;Good-bye to all that&quot;.<br />I like Robert Graves' historical fiction very much, but I did not like this book. I should note that this is  a rewritten version of the book.  Graves apparently took most of the edge off of the original when he  rewrote it extensively in 1957.  It is possible that the original warrants this Top 100 ranking.  The  extant version does not.<br />GRADE: C-	2000-10-21

The history is pretty ordinary, the analysis pretty obvious (cities originated in  order to facilitate religion, security and trade) and the conclusions, that the city is a necessary element  in future human progress and must be strengthened and preserved, are simply wrong.  If Mumford was  once important, he has clearly been rendered a peripheral figure by the passage of time and his vision  has been proven obtuse by the march of human events.<br />Mumford was essentially an urbanomystic neo-Luddite.  At the same time that he opposed what he saw  as the deleterious affect of mechanization on the human soul, he lauded cities as enormous receptacles  for accumulated human intelligence.  But his antitechnology bias blinded him to the role that  technology would play in making the city obsolete.  Computers serve as much more efficient storage  centers for knowledge than all the libraries in any city ever could and the Internet has made the entire  World into an interlocking community.<br />He also viewed cities as somehow uniquely suited to serve as the stage for human development.  I'm  not sure I even follow his reasoning here, but he seemed to think that humankind benefited from the  mere proximity to one another that urbanization forced and the possibility for institutional structures  that this allowed.  This is pure Socialist Utopian blither.  The latter quarter of this century has seen  Man in full retreat from these restrictive authoritarian institutions and from the urban hells in which  they arise.  Mumford's view that benign social structures would arise organically as a unique function  of urbanization, has shown itself to be disastrously wrong.  Cities have instead proven to serve as  concentrations of human pathologies (crime, drugs, pollution, family disintegration, etc.).<br />It is perhaps best to simply ignore this whole line of argument since, not surprisingly, this intellectual  saint of Urbanism moved to rural Dutchess County in 1936 and spent the rest of his life there.  As we  well know, humans, given a choice,  will seldom choose the city over the country and modern  technology is increasingly granting us all this freedom of choice.<br />This is a very muddleheaded book.  It can only have made this list because the pointy headed liberal  Left still has some affinity for New York City.  It's a New Yorker reader's pick.

2238104:US	52173832	R4C0DY6POJJAJ	0895264072	46193347	Edmund Burke: Selected Writings and Speeches	Books	5	22	24	N	N	conservatism's bard	What a heady time were the late 1700's.  For hundreds, even thousands, of years, Western man had  been saddled with monarchy; kings who were said to rule by divine right.  But by the end of the 18th  century, Martin Luther, John Locke and Adam Smith had propounded the essential framework for  modern liberal capitalist democracy and the Revolution in America had launched a grand experiment  based on those ideas.  Then came the French Revolution and it was blithely assumed that here again  Liberty was on the march.  When suddenly, rising to meet the tide of history, came Edmund Burke to  excoriate the Jacobins and denounce the Revolution.  In so doing, he not only did mankind a great  service, by sounding the alarms against unchecked liberty, he also basically gave birth to modern  Conservatism.  Today, after a long period in the wilderness, particularly during the Cold War, Edmund  Burke has come roaring back into fashion.  In a sense, he has finally won his argument with the  defenders of the French Revolution, two hundred years after the fact, and is reaping the spoils.<br />For two centuries a controversy has raged over Burke's political philosophy, in particular whether the  great defender of American, Irish and Indian rights was inconsistent in opposing the French  Revolution.  The very existence and the stubborn persistence of this controversy seem to demonstrate  either a complete misunderstanding or a willful misrepresentation of Burke's basic arguments.  One  suspects it's a bit of both.  The greatness of Burke lies in the fact that he was among the first, and  certainly the most eloquent, defenders of democracy to recognize the dangers it entails; that power in  the hands of the masses is just as great a threat to liberty as when it lies in the hand of a dictator or  king.  This point had been amply demonstrated in France, where the revolutionists had quickly  abandoned any concern for personal freedom and had moved on to a bloody demand for  equality--freedom's enemy.<br />It is here that we arrive at the key point that divides the modern Left and Right.  The Left believes (a la  Rousseau) that man is by nature &quot;good&quot; and all men are born with equal abilities, but that  environmental factors and corrupt institutions warp individuals, making some evil and keeping others  from realizing their full potentials; which if realized would make them equal to other men.  The goal  of the Left is therefore to remove, by any means necessary, these environmental and institutional  impediments and return to an imagined state of nature where all men are good and are equally able;  where Man will be governed by pure reason.<br />The Right, on the other hand, recognizes that man is inately &quot;evil&quot;; that is, evil in the sense that he is  self centered and will generally act in his own interest not the interest of others.  Moreover, men are  inherently unequal; in the state of nature, the able will tyrannize the less able.  It is for these reasons  that men form governments in the first place; to protect themselves from one another.  The goal of the  Right is to provide each individual with the greatest personal freedom and utmost opportunity to realize  his potential, consistent with the basic safety concerns that gave birth to the state in the first instance.  Conservatives realize that pure reason will not lead men to treat each other with justice, by nature, men  will always seek advantage over one another.  The State and other institutions safeguard us against this  eventuality.<br />This fundamental difference can not be overstated.  Prior to the 18th century, the Left would have  included all democrats, while the Right would have been made up of monarchists and supporters of  aristocracy.  But beginning with the French Revolution, this fissure separated the regnant liberal forces  into two competing camps, setting the stage for the two century long contest that ended in the early  1990's with the fall of the Soviet Union.  Both sides would produce great men, original theorists,  brilliant writers and magnificent orators, but none of them would ever surpass Burke and his mastery of  all these fields.  Rare are the men who so clearly perceive the fundamental issues that confront  mankind.  They seem at times to be travelers from the future, come to warn us about what horrors the  years to come will hold unless we obey their counsel.  Rarer still are the occasions when we heed  them.  We can only imagine the millions of lives that would have been saved had people followed  Burke's vision rather that that of Rousseau and Jefferson and Marx.<br />Happily, here in America, James Madison's Constitution embodies many of the same ideas and protects  against many of the concerns which Burke expressed.  The adoption of representative, rather than  direct, democracy; the bicameral legislature and tripartite government; the careful system of checks and  balances; the protection of basic rights from government interference: these are all, though we seldom  discuss them in these terms, intended to protect the individual from the potentially tyrannical effects of  democracy.  When commentators speak of the genius of the American system, whether they realize it  or not, it is to this central fact that they refer.  So while critics have struggled to understand a false  dichotomy in Burke's thought, we (and to a lesser extent the Brits) have enjoyed the fruits of a political  system which assumes that his critique of democracy is less theory than received wisdom.  For  whatever reason, it took two hundred years and countless millions of lives before the rest of the world  recognized what Burke (the bard) and Madison (the draftsman) had known all along; two centuries that  proved them indisputably correct.<br />GRADE: A+e Soviet Union.

Forster treats seven different aspects--the story, people, plot, fantasy, prophecy, pattern,  and rhythm--in a breezy conversational style.  Along the way, he offers examples, both good and bad,  from literary history.  I found myself agreeing and dissenting about equally, but the whole thing was  immensely interesting and entertaining.<br />Here are some of the observations that I agreed with and why:<br />  A story &quot;can only have one fault: that of making the audience not want to know what happens  next.&quot;<br />One inevitably thinks of James Joyce's Ulysses, which by now has surely retired the title of &quot;the book  most likely to remain unfinished&quot;.  No matter how revolutionary the technique, how insightful the  observations or how compelling the characters, a book that you can put down and not care what  happens next has failed in its most basic task. ----------------------<br />  The constant sensitiveness of characters for each other--even in writers called robust, like  Fielding--is remarkable, and has no parallel in life, except among those people who have plenty of  leisure.  Passion, intensity at moments--yes, but not this constant awareness, this endless  readjusting, this ceaseless hunger.  I believe that these are the reflections of the novelist's own state  of mind while he composes, and that the predominance of love in novels is partly because of this.<br />Forster elsewhere sites DH Lawrence favorably, but he seems to me to be an author whose characters  are so obsessed by passion as to be too novelistic, if not completely unrealistic.  But, the example I  would site here actually is not a case of love predominating to excess, but rather Crime and Punishment , where the characters' constant awareness of the philosophical and moral implications of  their every thought and deed is such that it could only be the product of an author in intellectual  overdrive.  If real people truly lived their lives this way, nothing would ever get done. ----------------------<br />  In the losing battle that the plot fights with the characters, it often takes a cowardly revenge.  Nearly all novels are feeble at the end.  This is because the plot requires to be wound up.  Why is  this necessary?  Why is there not a convention which allows a novelist to stop as soon as he feels  muddled or bored?  Alas, he has to round things off, and usually the characters go dead while he is  at work, and our final impression of them is through deadness.<br />Anyone who's ever read one of his books will instantly call to mind James Clavell.  I recall the jarring  sensation of finishing his great novel Tai-Pan when, many hundreds of pages into the book, unwilling  to see it conclude, but obviously noticing that their were a dwindling number of pages; I could not  imagine how he would conclude the main plot line so quickly, let alone tie up all of the remaining  loose ends.  And then, BOOM!, our hero is dead and the book is over.  And why?  I was ready to read  on for as long as he wanted to keep writing.  Or, at worst, he could have just stopped in mid story and  said: &quot;To be continued...&quot;  But Forster is right; the conventions of the novel almost require authors to<br />let the tiger out of the cage at the end, and, more often then not, it leaves a bitter taste in the reader's  mouth, regardless of how much we'd enjoyed the book up until that point.<br />There is much food for thought of this kind in this witty, opinionated, fascinating survey of the novel.  Add to that a really fine hammer job on Henry James and the fact that said hammering upset Virginia  Woolf and we're talking big thumbs up here.<br />GRADE: A-dominating to excess, but rather Crime and Punishment , where the characters' constant awareness of the philosophical and moral implications of  their every thought and deed is such that it could only be the product of an author in intellectual  overdrive.

However, while Richard Wright's classic account of his upbringing in the Jim Crow South  remains a powerful indictment of a system of repression and dehumanization which indelibly stain's  this great nation's history, the book is somehow simply not a compelling text.  Wright never really  engages the reader emotionally nor wins our empathy.  It, thus, seems more important as a historical  document than central to the Western Canon.<br />The primary reason for this is that Richard Wright, as he portrays himself in the book, is just an  *expletive deleted*.  And while it is certainly legitimate to argue that he is merely a creation of the  malignant system of segregation and racial hatred, the history of the South and of other racist regimes  (i.e., Nazi Germany) suggest that he is not an inevitable product of the system.  The Richard Wright  that he presents is so brutal, bitter and hate filled, that he is impossible to care about.  He stands in stark  contrast to the many still generous, hope filled, decent people who emerged from this same oppression  (or others like it); people whose positive vision and dream of freedom brought down Jim Crow within  a generation.<br />Moreover, he compares unfavorably to the survivors of the Death Camps and the Gulag and the other  heinous criminal enterprises of the century, who emerged from experiences that were at least as brutal  and seemingly soul deadening to produce a body of literature that is instead life affirming.  This is not  to suggest that Wright's experiences and reactions and personal development are unworthy of notice and  study, rather, I would suggest that we have more to gain by studying Elie Weisel and Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn and Vassily Grossman and Anchee Min and their like, who have turned similar  experiences into a testament of hope and human dignity rather than one of despair.<br />I know you aren't supposed to say these kinds of things in our politically correct age, but I disliked the  Richard Wright of this memoir too strongly to genuinely care about his life.  And this feeling of  disgust towards his character, allowed at least this reader an unfortunate psychic distance from the  revulsion one should feel towards the circumstances and environment of his youth.  More troubling  though than the fact that I had this reaction, is that many comments by young readers on the Web and  at Amazon indicate that they shared this reaction.  If the texts that they are supposed to be learning  about Segregation from are instead putting them off, the way that this one does, that is a serious matter.<br />GRADE: Csupposed to say these kinds of things in our politically correct age, but I disliked the  Richard Wright of this memoir too strongly to genuinely care about his life.

Normal science is dependent on the adoption of a universally accepted paradigm which  defines research problems for the scientist, tells him/her what to expect, and provides the methods  that s/he will use in solving them. However, in the course of research, scientists inevitably stumble  upon anomalies which the paradigm is unable to explain. If the paradigm repeatedly fails to explain  the anomaly, a crisis ensues and alternative theories develop. Eventually a competing theory proves  relatively successful in explaining the anomaly and it replaces the old paradigm. This replacement is  Kuhn's &quot;scientific revolution.&quot; Initially, the scientific community resists the replacement, but with  time the success of the new paradigm gains enough support to win out. According to Kuhn, the  adoption of a new paradigm necessarily establishes the creation of new research problems,  methods, and expected results. The scientists within the discipline thus sees the world in a different  way than it &quot;was&quot; under the old paradigm. Once the old paradigm is replaced and the revolution has  ended, normal science reemerges only to await the discovery of new anomalies.  -SYNOPSIS: Prof. John Dowell at Bowling Green<br />There, that was certainly easier than going through the exercise of coming up with my own version of  Kuhn's argument.  Just a quick perusal of the resources on the Internet indicates that there are two  general bases of attack on Kuhn.  First, there is a semantic attack because he is somewhat lackadaisical  in his use of the term paradigm.  Some nitwit has actually counted 21 different definitions for it in this  one book.  Big whoop!  I think it is, or should be, generally accepted that we know what he means; a  paradigm is basically the accepted wisdom of a society as it pertains to one area of knowledge--it is the  prevailing explanation for something.<br />Second, many scientists attack him on the basis that his theory is too cynical, implying as it does that  scientific theories are simply temporarily useful utilities for explaining things.  And since, on some  level, we are always awaiting the next paradigm shift, this theory undermines our confidence in their  work.  This, it strikes me, is precisely what makes Kuhn's theory so valuable.  Like Karl Popper he has  laid down a challenge to science.  In the heady days of the Enlightenment, The Age of Reason and the  Industrial Revolution, it was argued that it was possible that all of existence would yield to human  reason and science would explain everything to us.  Personally, I feel that this is true and we will  eventually reach such a stage.  But what Popper and Kuhn combined to do was to remind how far we  are from such a point and to demonstrate the importance of doubting the current models of thought.  Some scientists would like us to believe that they are discovering abstract truth; this is simply not the  case.  Science provides us with the best current explanation for things, not with truth.<br />Now Kuhn and Popper are also challenged in regards to whether history has actually followed their  theories.  Have scientific revolutions really followed the incremental paths that Kuhn describes?  I don't  honestly know the answer to that question.  But it seems to me that his idea of a paradigm shift, taken  metaphorically, does fit with our intuition about how a society's view of big issues evolves.  Take  Welfare Reform as an example.  For 50 years the received wisdom of the elites was that government  spending would alleviate poverty and provide the necessary stopgap to tide people over so that they  could get jobs.  Government agencies and liberal colleges spent millions of dollars on studies to show  that this system was working.  Even as research and observation steadily ate away at that notion and  conservative critics began to question the system, the establishment clung tenaciously to the outmoded  model.  As competing theories were tried in states like Wisconsin and met with success, the public  simply lost faith in the assurances of the bureaucracy and President Clinton was forced to adopt the  conservative's competition model or be left on the dust heap of history.  The paradigm had shifted and  the revolution occurred.<br />It may be that Kuhn's thesis, like any of the paradigmatic systems of the past, will be disproved or has  so many anomalies that it too will be discarded.  But it certainly seems that, for now,  it is a useful way  of understanding how revolutions in our understanding of the world around us come about.<br />GRADE: Aon studies to show  that this system was working.

There was a seemingly infinite series of tests. . .a dizzy progression of steps and  ledges. . .a pyramid extraordinarily high and steep; and the idea was to prove at every foot of the  way up that pyramid that you were one of the elected and anointed ones who had the right stuff and  could move higher and higher and even--ultimately, God willing, one day--that you might be able to  join that special few at the very top, that elite who had the capacity to bring tears to men's eyes, the  very Brotherhood of the Right Stuff itself.  -Tom Wolfe, The Right Stuff<br />I don't know whether Tom Wolfe invented New Journalism or merely noticed that it was aborning,  even he would probably credit Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, but he's certainly one of the greatest  practitioners and The Right Stuff one of his greatest achievements.  The essence of this &quot;new&quot; writing  style was that non-fiction writers would write with a distinct authorial voice and would utilize the  techniques of the novel.  Most importantly,  rather than having the story exist solely to convey facts,  the facts were to serve the story.  This allowed the writer some license to play with reality a little, as  long as the story remained &quot;true&quot; and it allowed the writer to aim for telling big truths, those which  would frequently lie beyond the perspective of a conventional story.<br />All of these innovations are brilliantly on display here.  Every paragraph of the book reeks of Tom  Wolfe, from the capitalization of certain concepts (it not just the right stuff, it's The Right Stuff) to the  snarky jabs at myriad puffed up targets.  By using the structure of a novel, he gives the story a  conceptual coherence that straight reportage might not have offered--thus, he starts with Yeager and the  first supersonic jets, then presents the story of the Mercury program, then returns to Yeager and the end  of the effort to build jets that would actually have traveled into space.  All of this seems uniquely suited  to satire or parody or simply viscious attack, indeed, Wolfe has used the stylistic conventions of New  Journalism for just these purposes in books like &quot;Radical Chic&quot; and &quot;Bauhaus to Our House&quot; to brilliant  effect.  But an interesting thing happens in The Right Stuff.  Even though we hear that snide voice  trying to speak out periodically, Wolfe is so smitten by the jet pilots and astronauts and their wives that  he writes about, that these devices are turned on their collective head and they become the  accouterments of a kind of conscious, but unabashed, myth making.<br />In the end, the book becomes a sort of American Ring of the Nibelungen or Iliad.  I remember when  Philip Kaufman's movie version came out, people were a little disconcerted by the stylized  story-telling, but it seemed to me that he had handled the material exactly right, like the libretto for a  Grand Opera.  As a newish country and a fairly secular one, we don't have many myths or fables (with  the notable exception of the Western), but what Tom Wolfe serves up here, is a quintessential  American epic, complete with archetypes and leitmotifs and the lot.  By looking back at the &quot;real&quot;  events through the lens of his book, we can actually penetrate to truths about our culture and our  national character that would not have been apparent in a straightforward history of the Space Program.<br />This is a great book and Wolfe is one of our greatest writers.<br />GRADE: A+s one of our greatest writers.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-21

Perhaps the rate at which the disaster  is increasing has been slowed, but that itself is a disturbing thought. Since the publication of Silent  Spring, pesticide use on farms alone has doubled to 1.1 billion tons a year, and production of these  dangerous chemicals has increased by 400 percent. We have banned certain pesticides at home, but  we still produce them and export them to other countries. This not only involves a readiness to  profit by selling others a hazard we will not accept for ourselves; it also reflects an elemental failure  to comprehend that the laws of science do not observe the boundaries of politics. Poisoning the  food chain anywhere ultimately poisons the food chain everywhere.  -Al Gore<br />It is the premise of Silent Spring that the Age of Chemicals represents an impending disaster for  mankind, that use and overuse of chemical compounds is going to cause enormous health problems by  both direct contact and as they work their way up the food chain.  Carson seized on declining bird  populations as an early warning sign that the effects were already being felt in animal populations.  She  used the metaphor of a Silent Spring, a Spring without birdsong, to convey the horror of where we  were headed.  As Al Gore laments above, her warnings were largely unheeded and the use of chemicals  has grown rapidly.

The title &quot;Best&quot; should  indicate that the book conveys some fundamental and timeless human truths. It would be more accurate  to say that Silent Spring is a &quot;great&quot; book.  Even then, Silent Spring is undoubtedly an important and  influential book, but it is great only in the sense that Thomas Malthus' Essay on the Principle of  Population (1798) was great (or The Communist Manifesto and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion  and Mein Kampf for that matter).  It is great because it had a profound influence on attitudes and  actions, despite the fact that it was completely wrong. At the end of a Century that has seen the  widespread use of chemicals accompany tremendous lengthening of human life spans, deep cuts in  infant mortality rates and the revival of most endangered species, isn't it time to acknowledge that the  argument of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring was a complete fallacy?

Hardy to Bertrand Russell<br />There is something ineffably sad about this book by the mathematician G.H. Hardy, by all accounts a  brilliant and a decent man, who was approaching the end of his career and realized that his  contributions in the field all lay behind him.  The &quot;apology&quot; seems in many ways to be for not being  the kind of surpassing genius who revolutionizes scientific/mathematical thought--a Newton, an  Einstein or a Gauss, not even the kind of natural genius that his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Ramanujan was.  Hardy  described himself as &quot;at best, for a short time, the fifth best pure mathematician in the world.&quot;  His best  work came in collaboration with Ramanujan and Littlewood.  But it was great work and he was one of  the best mathematicians of his time and that gives the apology a kind of self-indulgent tone; who but he  cares whether he was number five or number one?  It's as if Jim Kelly felt compelled to write a book  justifying his career in football because he was a runner up five times.<br />Hardy makes it clear that he sees mathematics as a unique endeavor and achievement in the field as the  one guarantor of true immortality:<br />  Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and  mathematical ideas do not. &quot;Immortality&quot; may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has  the best chance of whatever it may mean.<br />But he has a glaring blind spot; perhaps understandably, he overemphasizes the centrality of math to  human existence.  C.P. Snow's Introduction to the book discusses Hardy's lifelong animus towards  religion and Hardy himself is pretty dismissive of politicians, philosophers, artists and authors.  But the  fact is that billions of people remember the words of Moses and Christ and Mohammed and the  Buddha, can quote long passages of Shakespeare, can hum a few bars of Bach and Beethoven and  Elvis.  But ask us what Gauss did and our eyes will glaze over.  Hardy was apparently attracted to  mathematics because it was a closed system (or series of systems) with set parameters and certain  proofs.  Within that system men can achieve certainty and can achieve immortality at least in the eyes  of those who study the system, but how do the accomplishments of these men measure up against those  of men like John Locke and Adam Smith and James Madison who created the liberal democratic  capitalist state?<br />It is not surprising that Hardy had such tunnel vision, because mathematics was apparently his whole  life, except for cricket.  He spent his whole career in the ivory tower.  He had no family.  As  mentioned, he had ditched any religious beliefs.  What was left to him but his chosen field of study?  It  comes as no surprise when Snow reveals that Hardy later, with his health failing, tried to commit  suicide.  If math was his life and he had lost the creativity necessary to excel at it, what would be the  point of continuing?<br />This is a very fine book, interesting, accessible and eminently quotable.  But like many of the  intellectuals of his generation (he was loosely affiliated with the Apostles and the Bloomsbury Group),  there is a hollowness apparent at his core.  In his discussion of a couple of mathematical proofs, it is  obvious that Hardy revels in the achievements of the men who demonstrated that these numerical  relationships exist.  As I read, I was struck by a tangible sense that the beauty of these relationships  implies a creator behind them.  I repeat implies, not proves. And I mean creator, not Creator.  Recalling Einstein's statement that &quot;God does not play dice with the Universe&quot;, I can not believe that  there is a physicist or mathematician who, in his heart of hearts, truly believes that we will never know  the fundamental equations for the processes that created the Universe.  The logical implication is that if  it is possible eventually to understand these formulae, or even merely conceivable that they can be  understood, then  isn't it also conceivable, even likely, that some kind of intelligent being may have set  them in motion in the first place.  If these suppositions are comprehensible, isn't  it also possible, even  likely, that in the process of coming to understand them, we are becoming divine, that one day we will  use a Grand Unified Theory to ourselves become Creators?<br />Suffice it to say, these are not the sorts of speculations that engaged G.H. Hardy.  Instead he ended his,  by his own measure, mediocre career, cloistered away in the insular world of the university, alone and  compelled to produce a written justification for his life.  The self portrait he has produced is one of the  saddest images I've encountered of the bitter harvest that has been reaped by the hollow men  of the 20th Century.<br />GRADE: Bw  the fundamental equations for the processes that created the Universe.

It has  engendered much controversy over whether Markham herself wrote the book.  It now appears to be  pretty reliably proven that her third husband, the writer Raoul Schumacher, was the author.  However,  the story is still that of Beryl Markham and it is the extraordinary story of a remarkable woman.<br />In the first half of the book she tells about her experiences growing up on a farm in Njaro, Kenya.  From the adventures of her dog Buller, who fought boars and leopards, to her own experiences hunting  with Nandi tribesmen, on to encounters with mad horses &amp; not quite domesticated lions, this section is  the equal of, if not superior to, Isak Dinesen's Out of Africa.  (In fact, in it's elegiac evocation of a way  of life disappearing before the author's eyes, it reminded me of nothing so much as the wonderful  How  Green Was My Valley by Richard Llewellyn.)<br />Then there's a brief interlude while she trains race horses after her father's farm fails &amp; he leaves the  country.  Here she relates the thrilling tale of a race between a horse, Wild Child, with bad legs and  another horse that she had trained, Wrack, but that was taken away from her because of her lack of  experience.  The description of the race is as good as anything I've ever read.<br />Finally, Tom Black teaches her to fly &amp; she befriends men like Bror Blixen &amp; Dennis Finch-Hatton  (Dinesen's husband and her lover respectively). The deft &amp; understated comedic touch that is displayed  throughout the book is evident in this passage about a Kenyan landing strip:<br />  A high wire fence surrounds the aerodrome-a wire fence and then a deep ditch.  Where is there  another aerodrome fenced against wild animals?  Zebra, wildebeest, giraffe, eland--at night they lurk  about the tall barrier staring with curious wild eyes into that flat field, feeling cheated.<br />  They are well out of it, for themselves and for me.  It would be a hard fate to go down in the  memory of one's friends as having been tripped up by a wandering zebra.  'Tried to take off and hit  a zebra!'

He  subsequently turned that experience into a lecture, a Vanity Fair article and this extremely slight (84  pages) memoir.  The process of explaining his mental illness seems to have rendered him  schizophrenic, if he was not already.<br />When I reviewed Sophie's Choice (see Orrin's review; Grade: C), I noted, without knowing of his  depression, that Styron seemed to have some psychological problems.  I based my belief on his decision  to write his novels from non-white, female or other ethnic perspectives; he seemed like a man who was  so profoundly uncomfortable with himself and consumed by White Liberal guilt, as to be unbalanced.  It can hardly have come as a surprise to anyone that he descended into a nearly suicidal spiral of  depression.  But, lo and behold, it surprised him and this is symptomatic of the problems with the  book.  On the one hand, Styron seems to want to bare his soul and win our sympathy for others like  him, but on the other hand he is so dishonest and/or obtuse, that he offers little of value to his audience.<br />I'll just point out two other areas where his analysis fails the reader.  He labors mightily to exonerate  the depressed from moral judgment and portray them as mere victims of an organic condition, but as he  notes, the chemical changes in the brain that exacerbate depression are preceded by some prior, purely  psychological, condition--stress, guilt, what have you.  Now, I do not mean to suggest that  susceptibility to Depression is necessarily indicative of moral weakness, surely we can all understand  and sympathize with the bereaved parent or spouse who falls prey to depression after losing a child or  partner.  But I am suggesting that in many cases, the mindset and moral philosophy of the sufferer  seems to be a contributing factor in the development of depression.<br />This seems especially clear, and is annoyingly ignored, when Styron discusses the other famous  sufferers of depression, most of whom committed suicide--Virginia Woolf, Albert Camus, Sylvia  Plath, etc.  It escapes his notice that these are all figures of the Left, plagued by the same tormented  liberal guilt as he.  The two friends and fellow victims who he discusses are Art Buchwald and Mike  Wallace; the three of them have moped through the past forty years, attacking their country, their  society and the inequities they perceive.  Of course, they are depressed, they hate themselves and the  world they live in.  Significantly, the two great conservative sufferers, Churchill and Lincoln, both  great believers in the ultimate goodness of man and democracy and their countries, were able to  overcome their black moods without psychiatry or pharmacology.  It seems logical to suppose that the  group of catterwauling suicidal wretches that Styron associates himself with are predisposed to  self-destructive depression by their political pessimism and moral anxiety, but this issue is not  addressed, so we'll leave it for another day.<br />This is a mildly interesting trifle about a unique manifestation of depression.  It in no way belongs on  this list.<br />GRADE: Cfactor in the development of depression.<br />This seems especially clear, and is annoyingly ignored, when Styron discusses the other famous  sufferers of depression, most of whom committed suicide--Virginia Woolf, Albert Camus, Sylvia  Plath, etc.  It escapes his notice that these are all figures of the Left, plagued by the same tormented  liberal guilt as he.

Vann Woodward's enormously influential examination of Jim Crow segregation laws in the  post-Civil War South he makes two fundamental points: first, that the imposition of strict segregation did not immediately follow the War; second, that the eventual adoption of Jim Crow laws was not  simply a function of racism--there were myriad political factors involved.<br />Woodward first provides a detailed analysis of the state of the races following the War.  He  demonstrates: that Slavery had required the proximity and interaction of Blacks and Whites, which  could not be reversed overnight; that Northern Republicans, Southern Conservatives and Southern  Radicals all had reasons to court black citizens; and reminds us that with the North virtually running the  South for a period of years, segregation would not have been allowed immediately after the war.<br />He then makes a compelling case that the true rise of Jim Crow came about, in the 1890's, due to a  confluence of factors: 1) Northern withdrawal from Southern affairs; 2) the changes in Northern  attitudes towards colored peoples as America became an Imperialist power; 3) the crushing depression  of the 80's, which added fuel to racial animus; 4) the concurrent rise of the Populists who were more  than willing to play the race card; and 5) the series of Supreme Court rulings which sanctioned  separation.<br />Finally, he turns to the demise of segregation, which was going on even as he wrote the several editions  of his book.  Here again, he identifies a number of factors, besides the Civil Rights movement, which  contributed to Jim Crow's fall: Northern migration; changing, but this time improving, attitudes  towards colored peoples, as exemplified at the UN; the reversal of course by the Supreme Court; and  the improved economic condition of the Nation generally.<br />In chronicling this rise and fall of Jim Crow, demonstrating that segregation was a gradual rather than  an immediate &amp; natural response to the end of slavery and showing that many factors besides race lead  to the adoption of segregation policies, Woodward makes an inestimable contribution to our  understanding of the horrific legal repression of Southern Blacks.<br />GRADE: Bto the end of slavery and showing that many factors besides race lead  to the adoption of segregation policies, Woodward makes an inestimable contribution to our  understanding of the horrific legal repression of Southern Blacks.<br />GRADE: B	2000-10-21

I had a farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong Hills. The equator runs across these highlands, a  hundred miles to the North, and the farm lay at an altitude of over six thousand feet. In the day-time  you felt that you had got high up, near to the sun, but the early mornings and evenings were limpid  and restful, and the nights were cold.  -Isak Dinesen, Out of Africa<br />Why is it do you suppose, that these should be among the most moving and recognizable opening lines  in all of literature?  I used to think that they lingered in memory just because of the creepy way that  Meryl Streep recites them in the movie.  But even contemporaneous reviews often mentioned their  haunting quality.  I think that ultimately it must be because the book is so specifically about a unique  time and place and that this introduction serves to place us there so completely.  That after all is what  makes the book special, the way that it captures, in minute detail, the brief moment of Colonial  splendor in Kenya and turns it into something out of a fairy tale.<br />Of course, we now know that Isak Dinesen's version of this colony is in fact more mythical than  factual--that she was actually Karen Blixen, that in reality the husband who is virtually nonexistent in  these pages gave her venereal disease, that Hatton-Finch was not just a buddy but a lover and that the  natives, for all her seeming love and respect for them, probably would not appreciate the way she  continually compares them to animals.  And it is because we know all these things that a book which  when it was written seemed merely elegiac now seems truly deluded.  But despite all that we've learned  in the intervening years, it remains, on it's own terms,  a beautiful and heartrending book.

As even a brief search of the Internet will reveal, it is one of the most widely discussed topics in  political philosophy. I fondly recall arguing about Rawls' theories in John Singer's Values and  Institutions class at Colgate, so it was interesting to finally try reading it.  It turns out, the revolution  that Rawls created was based on a simple but totally specious change in the assumptions about human  nature, and upon this rotten foundation he built up a shaky edifice to justify Liberal yearnings.  The  book is reminiscent of a treatise by a Medieval scientist, working out the elaborate orbital patterns that  planets would require if the Universe actually were geocentric.<br />In order to accomplish his revolution, Rawls posited a counterintuitive and antihistorical starting point  for the discussion of political theory. The great political philosophers, Hobbes, Locke, etc., had used  the &quot;state of nature&quot; as the starting point for their theories.  In this state of nature, men were assumed to  be completely self-centered and dedicated only to their own interests, with the result that life was  &quot;nasty, brutish and short&quot; and only the strongest survived.  But gradually men tired of this blood sport  and entered into a social contract wherein they surrendered some personal sovereignty to a central  governing entity, which, in whatever form, would enforce a set of impartial laws in order to protect  men from one another.  This is a pretty minimalist position, the social contract and the government that  it creates serve only to provide a certain level of physical security, leaving men free to pursue their own  fortunes and taking no interest in the degree to which they succeed.  But it conforms with our intuitive  understanding of human nature, our observations of our fellow man and, most importantly, it has  proven a workable basis for understanding politics for some 300 years.<br />The essential change that Rawls made was to replace the State of Nature with his &quot;Original Position&quot;,  wherein, when it came time for primordial man to enter into a social contract, because he would be  ignorant of his own capacities (the &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;), he would pursue a low risk strategy and choose  a social contract based on egalitarianism; he would seek the most equal distribution of wealth and  power possible, just in case it turned out that he was the least fit of the species.<br />If Rawls is right, if men acted on the assumption that they would be one of the ones left behind once  the race of life begins, then the rest of his theory might be worth examining.  But, of course, this  assumption runs counter to everything we understand about ourselves and our fellow human beings.  It  is a fuzzy headed liberal's view of the appropriate strategy for life's losers--make political decisions on  the basis of the likelihood that you are a loser and need help.  But look around a casino or a Lottery  Ticket line and you will see that the losers think that they too are winners.  Look at polls about taxation  levels and you find that the lower class does not want the upper class taxed too heavily, because they  assume that they, or their children, are headed for that bracket eventually.  It turns out that people act  very much as the great philosophers expected them to; they act out of naked self interest and the belief  that they are capable and deserve whatever they can achieve.  The justice that men seek is in fact little  more than an impartial application of a set of laws that are fair to all, not an equal distribution of goods  and power, which would necessarily impinge on the freedom of all.<br />Rawls' great error is to try to base his theory on a generalized yearning for &quot;happiness&quot;.  Rawls was  seeking a positive definition of Man's aspiration in the &quot;original position&quot;, butthe inevitable result,  because we will all define happiness differently, is to create a foundational quagmire for his theories.  After all, you may define happiness as having a lot of stuff, but I may define it as spiritual  enlightenment.  The classic understanding, basing the social contract on the avoidance of death, is  obviously universal, we are all agreed that our own deaths are to be avoided, and, therefore, more  sound.  .<br />Finding the basic supposition that props up Rawls' whole theory to be fundamentally incorrect, it  behooves us little to examine the superstructure he seeks to construct upon this error.  Suffice it to say,  no system of government has ever achieved a more equal distribution of wealth and power than has the  American Constitutional Republic and it is based on the classic understanding of human nature found in  Hobbes and Locke.

He defined religion as &quot;the feelings, acts, and experiences of  individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever  they may consider the divine.&quot; He is the great enunciator of the idea that all religions are equally valid  and valuable, that since they can contain no animating truths, they should be measured merely by their  effects on individuals.  He is profoundly wrong.<br />He is wrong in the way that all of the great artists of the Romantic period, from Wordsworth, Shelley  and Keats to Picasso, are wrong, in his emphasis on the individual and his denial of the universal and  the absolute.  James offers a view of religion as a wholly personal matter, the utility of which lies in its  benefits for each person.  Like all of his intellectual cohorts, he had lost faith in universal truth.  Indeed, one biographer has suggested that the succession of short term jobs that he held lead him to  posit the equal value of all experiences.  Because of this crisis of faith, he was unable to make  judgments about the truth or value of different religious beliefs or ultimately to believe that any belief  system had value beyond the effects on individual believers.<br />The great challenge that confronts Western man is to reclaim the primacy of Judeo-Christianity from  James and his ilk.  Genesis, the Ten Commandments and the Gospels are not merely inspirational for  individuals, taken together they express the aspirations of the species.  Mankinds struggle to rise from  the sheeplike state of Adam (before the fall) towards eventual Godhood, is the organizing story that has  produced most of our greatest achievements.

Homage to Catalonia, written  immediately after his return and published in 1938, tells the story of his military service with the  POUM, both against the Right and the Left, and, in quick succession, of his initial hopes for the  classless society that he thought he had found on first arrival, then of his disappointment with the level  of disorganization of the Leftist forces and finally of his disillusionment when pro-Stalinist &quot;allies&quot;  began attacking Socialists and Anarchists who refused to toe the Soviet line.  Orwell, who by then had  nearly been killed when shot through the neck in battle, and his wife were ultimately forced to flee  from Spain, to avoid Stalinist security forces, which had labeled him pro-fascist.<br />The one thing, more than any other, that makes Orwell one of the great literary and cultural figures of  the 20th Century, is that it was this last fact that truly galled him.  Orwell was committed to the idea of  revolutionary Socialism.  As he says when the security forces attack POUM:<br />  I have no particular love for the idealized 'worker' as he appears in the bourgeois Communist's  mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the  policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.<br />He was fueled by an animus towards the class system which is almost incomprehensible to us  Americans, but which came naturally to young British intellectuals, particularly in the wake of the First  World War.  Accordingly, he was not unsympathetic to the Soviet decision that they had to take over  the Left in Spain; in his revolutionary heart, he could understand that such a maneuver, however brutal  might eventually serve the greater cause of the Workers.  No, what he could not tolerate was that the  perpetrators and their fellow travelers in the Press lied about it.  It is the essence of the man that being  purged was tolerable, but having his political beliefs portrayed incorrectly was intolerable.<br />Orwell's concern for honest language is easy to discern in 1984 (see Orrin's review) and Animal Farm  (see Orrin's review) once you know to look for it, but it is first evident here.  He recognized early on  that one of the ways in which dictators would attack freedom was to degrade the language and by  cheapening the meaning of words, deaden the emotional reaction of the citizenry to events.  Prescient  in so many ways, Orwell was never more correct than when he made this connection between the  integrity of language and the integrity of the men using it.  One can only imagine a profile of Bill  Clinton as written by Orwell.<br />The Spanish Civil War is second only to the Hitler/Stalin pact as a dividing line between mere  Left-Wingers and genuine Communists.  It was here that the true nature of the Soviet Union first  intruded itself upon the public consciousness to such a degree that its defenders truly had to be  considered apologists, not simply naive do-gooders.  Orwell, objective and honest as always, wrote  only about what he saw, so his portrayal of events is necessarily incomplete and, writing while the  conflict was still going on, he was not able to form the really harsh judgments that our historical  perspective allows us to make.  But it is to his great good credit that he wrote what he did and when he  did.  Many of his brethren on the Left refused to do so for fear of hurting &quot;the cause&quot;.  Orwell chose to  tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may; for that alone he should be celebrated.<br />GRADE: Aserve the greater cause of the Workers.

He recognized early on  that one of the ways in which dictators would attack freedom was to degrade the language and by  cheapening the meaning of words, deaden the emotional reaction of the citizenry to events.  Prescient  in so many ways, Orwell was never more correct than when he made this connection between the  integrity of language and the integrity of the men using it.  One can only imagine a profile of Bill  Clinton as written by Orwell.<br />The Spanish Civil War is second only to the Hitler/Stalin pact as a dividing line between mere  Left-Wingers and genuine Communists.  It was here that the true nature of the Soviet Union first  intruded itself upon the public consciousness to such a degree that its defenders truly had to be  considered apologists, not simply naive do-gooders.  Orwell, objective and honest as always, wrote  only about what he saw, so his portrayal of events is necessarily incomplete and, writing while the  conflict was still going on, he was not able to form the really harsh judgments that our historical  perspective allows us to make.  But it is to his great good credit that he wrote what he did and when he  did.  Many of his brethren on the Left refused to do so for fear of hurting &quot;the cause&quot;.  Orwell chose to  tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may; for that alone he should be celebrated.<br />GRADE: A	2000-10-21

Keynes basic argument was that the boom/bust cycle of the economy was inevitable and  that government should intervene to dampen both the peaks (via confiscatory taxation) and the valleys  (via deficit spending).  The goal being to guarantee full employment and to redistribute wealth.  Now,  it's understandable that the generation of men who faced the Depression were driven to propose some  aggressive solutions, but if we have to choose one, this is the moment when Western Man blinked.  Keynes basically abandoned a two century old faith in the efficacy of capitalism and proposed that  laissez-faire be replaced by the firm hand of government.<br />The ensuing fifty years saw virtually every nation of the West surrender increasing control of the  economy to the government, accept extortionate tax rates, pile up staggering deficits, and, all the while,  spiral farther and farther into the abyss.  The Keynesian Revolution brought the West to its knees  before Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan seized back control and began the long, and as we speak  uncertain, process of returning power to the marketplace.<br />Interestingly enough, while the Left remains in thrall to his thoroughly discredited theories, it seems  that Keynes himself might have been one of the first to abandon his own handiwork (this after all was a  man who ditched the Bloomsbury Group and homosexuality when he fell in love with a ballerina), had  he lived to see the disaster it was producing.  In the conclusion to his book he states:<br />  ...the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are  wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.  Indeed the world is ruled by little else.  Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are  usually the slaves of some defunct economist.  Madmen in authority, whom hear voices in the air,  are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.  I am sure that the  power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas.  Not, indeed, immediately, but after a certain interval; for in the field of economic and political  philosophy there are not many who are influenced by new theories after they are twenty-five or  thirty years of age, so that the ideas which civil servants and politicians and even agitators apply to  current events are not likely to be the newest.  But, soon or late, it is ideas, not vested interests,  which are dangerous for good or evil.<br />While his theories proved to be catastrophic, this paragraph is not only accurate, it proved to be  prophetic.  The real nadir, the West's point of greatest danger, came about twenty five or thirty years  into the Revolution, when Richard Nixon abandoned the fight against Keynes and embraced the welfare  state.  With the last line of defense nearly routed, Goldwater, Reagan and the like were lonely voices  crying in the wilderness, the final crack up came &amp; by the late 70's people were talking about malaise  and the failure of democracy and all kinds of defeatist twaddle.  We were fortunate that folks were  desperate enough to finally take a chance on the Iron Lady and the Gipper.  Likewise, we are living  through the first generation of the return to markets.  Clinton could have been a significant historical  figure had he had the courage of his supposed convictions and dragged the New Democrats over to the  side of individual freedom and limited government.  As it is, the ideais still being fought by the Left  and we will see if the eventual result is a return to big government, or the kind of stasis we've achieved  now, with government growing, but slowly, or whether there is a Democrat on the horizon who has the  stature and vision to lead the party back to the future.<br />Hopefully, Keynes was right and the power of the idea of freedom ensures its eventual victory.  But, it  must be acknowledged, Keynes General Theory was one of the greatest threats to our freedom that we  have ever weathered.  This book was a source of great evil in this century and Keynes must shoulder a  significant portion of the blame for the sorry state of the West circa 1978-79.<br />GRADE: Ffreedom and limited government.

The  cultivation of such a style is of importance because it is in the quality of our engagement that the  human worth of art is apparent--art matters in virtue of the kind of experience it invites the  spectator into.  There is no access to art except in private--in looking, thinking, feeling as we stand  before an individual work.  Cultivation requires that we draw upon our own resources of sensitivity,  reverie and contemplation, our capacity to invest our ideals and interests in the process of looking.  Without these we can only know about art as detached observers who look on without being able to  participate (like seeing people share a joke others don't quite catch).  -John Armstrong, Move Closer<br />John Armstrong, director of the Aesthetic Programme of the School for Advanced Study at the  University of London, is concerned here with &quot;our private, individual response to particular works of  art.&quot;  He delineates the various techniques that we use when we approach art and how we use them to  appreciate what we are seeing.  The book is short, eminently readable and contains sumptuous  illustrations which he uses to good effect in making his points.  But the points he's making all deal, as  his subtitle suggests, with internal reactions and personal likes and dislikes.  This is fine up to a point,  but there does come a point where this kind of intensely individualistic approach really abandons the  idea of art and particularly of great art.<br />Obviously there are personal reasons why one individual likes Rembrandt best and another likes  Michelangelo.  Framed in this context, such preferences are not all that significant--who is to say  ultimately which is the better artist ?  Does the attempt to differentiate even make a whole lot of  sense?  But carried to it's logical extreme, and it breaks down long before the extreme, the idea that  there is much significance to each individual's unique interaction with artwork undermines the concept  of art itself.  Given the 5 billion people on the planet, it is entirely possible that there's at least one  person who will like just about anything that someone puts down on paper.  The salient question is :  does the fact that someone reacts favorably to it make it art?  I would argue that it does not.  Armstrong uses the metaphor in the quote above of &quot;seeing people share a joke others don't quite  catch.&quot;  But an emphasis on individual reaction eventually leads to just such a situation, one where we  are all incapable of detachment and only react to those jokes (or paintings) which appeal uniquely to  us.  Then art ceases to be capable of communicating ideas; it is reduced instead to appealing to  viewers' emotions.  At another point armstrong compares the affection that we develop for certain  works of art to the way we develop love for another person, but someone loved Hitler and someone  loved Ted Bundy.  What do those emotions have to do with the absolute value of the objects of the  affection?<br />Great art, those works which we generally recognize as canonical, should not merely be attractive to a  few, but accessible to and appreciated by the multitudes.  Art should be universal, not individual, and  should prompt a general reaction in most of us, not in an elite or in a handful of folks.  There are two  excellent books by Tom Wolfe, The Painted Word (1975) &amp; From Bauhaus to Our House  (1981)(Tom Wolfe  1931-) (Grade: A+), and one by Jamie James, The Music of the Spheres :  Music, Science, and the Natural Order of the Universe (1995)(Jamie James), which together explain  how art, which was once held to objective standards of beauty, became so subjective over the past  century or two.  Mr. Armstrong's book is an entertaining and instructive guide to some of the ways  that we process what we see when we look at art and how certain works come to be our particular  favorites, but for a compelling vision of how art should be judged in general and of the shortcomings  of the modern individualistic approach to art, try Wolfe and James.<br />GRADE : Cw certain works come to be our particular  favorites, but for a compelling vision of how art should be judged in general and of the shortcomings  of the modern individualistic approach to art, try Wolfe and James.<br />GRADE : C	2000-10-19

Ostensibly the story of a love  triangle involving a naive American spook, a jaded English journalist and a young Vietnamese girl,  lurking just beneath the surface is an allegory for the whole experience of America in Vietnam.<br />Alden Pyle, the Quiet American of the title, was based on Col. Edward Lansdale, the renowned, or  infamous depending on your politics, CIA operative who was sent to Viet Nam in the 50's to subvert  the Vietminh after a string of successes in the Phillipines (he was also the model for William Lederer's  and Eugene Burdicks &quot;The Ugly American&quot;).  Pyle is an innocent who believes that others must surely  share his ideals and pureness of motive.  He is convinced, based on his adherence to the writings of  York Harding, that there is a Third Way for Vietnam, somewhere between Communism and the  corrupt colonial government.  He has come to Vietnam to foster a group that will adhere to this Third  Way.  The journalist, Fowler, a cynical world-weary man of much wider experience, realizes that Pyle  is a dangerous man because he is imposing his idealized vision on a group that is merely power  hungry.  Meanwhile, Pyle has fallen in love with Phuong, Fowler's Vietnamese girlfriend.  And while  Fowler can offer her little because his wife refuses to grant him a divorce, Pyle offers marriage and  respectability and a life in America.  As Fowler loses Phuong to Pyle and Pyle's group begins a terror  campaign, Fowler finally abandons his neutrality and chooses sides, a choice made all the more  ambiguous because of his romantic rivalry with Pyle.<br />The prescient pessimism that pervades this book is it's most interesting feature.  Greene, writing well  before we really got involved, seemed to sense that Vietnam was a tar baby that we idealistic  Americans would not be able to resist embracing.  Pyle's bloody blundering seems to presage the  well-intended but disastrous mess that we would make of the entire country in the decades to come.

It was just a new job.  You had to be careful.  You had to use  your brains.  It was not a question of hatred.  He had only seen the minister once : he had been  pointed out to Raven as he walked down the new housing estate between the little lit Christmas  trees--an old rather grubby man without any friends, who was said to love humanity.  -Graham Greene, This Gun for Hire<br />Raven is a hired killer with a harelip.  His profession and his deformity combine to give him a passion  for privacy.  But when he's hired to kill a socialist minister who's active in the peace movement and  ends up also shooting an elderly woman from his household staff too, he's suddenly one of the most  sought after men in England.  And when the man who hired him, Mr. Cholmondeley, pays him off in  counterfeit notes, he becomes an easy man to track.  In addition, his strong sense of professional ethics  lead him to try and find Cholmondeley and whoever's behind him, rather than simply hiding out.<br />Through a circuitous set of circumstances, Raven is helped in his search by a young woman, Anne,  whose boyfriend just happens to be the lead detective on his case.  She recognizes how dangerous  Raven is, but feels sorry for him and, with Europe sliding into war, thinks she can use him to strike  back at the shadowy forces who wanted the peace loving minister dead.<br />Though it lacks the universal moral tension of some of Greene's better work, this is an entertaining  noir thriller.  The plot depends on a few too many fortuitous twists, but if you take it in the spirit of  say The 39 Steps or a Hitchcock movie, the implausabilities aren't unbearable.  Perhaps the most  interesting reading of the book is as a forecast of the central ethical dilemma of WWII.  Think of  Raven as the USSR and of Anne as the Allies.

Yusef, a Syrian merchant suspected of the diamond smuggling, offers to lend  him the money.

Western pulp fiction writer Buck Dexter is actually  British hack writer Rollo Martins.  He's come to visit his schoolboy chum Harry Lime, but arrives just  in time for Harry's funeral.  The gentleman who catches a ride back from the services with Martins, is  really a British policeman; turns out, old pal Harry was a black marketeer, selling doctored penicillin  that is responsible for numerous deaths.  Harry's grieving girlfriend is a Russian refuge staying in  Vienna on forged documents.  The local Cultural organization that keeps pestering Martins to speak  to them mistakenly believes that he is the critically acclaimed writer, Benjamin Dexter.  But the thing  that is most misleading turns out to be the &quot;death&quot; of Harry Lime, as Martins discovers when he starts  trying to find the rumored third man who witnessed Harry's death.<br />When Graham Greene was asked to come up with a script for Carol Reed to film, he saw an  opportunity to flesh out the bare bones of an idea--suppose someone saw an old friend, supposedly  dead, on the street one day.  Of course, Greene &amp; Reed &amp; Orson Welles turned this idea into the great  movie The Third Man (1949).  For the novel, Greene returned to the scenario and rendered the whole  story as he originally envisioned it.  Most of the changes are fairly minor--freed of the presence of  Joseph Cotten, Martins is English not American--but sadly missing is the famous line from the movie,  which Welles apparently wrote himself, about Italy under the amoral Borgias producing magnificent  culture while Switzerland's hundreds of years of democracy has produced only chocolates and the  cuckoo clock.  It does retain the great concluding chase through the sewers of the city, which seem to  physically embody the moral cesspool that Cold War Europe was becoming.  This is a work that  presages LeCarre and much of the ambivalent spy fiction of the 60's &amp; 70's.

Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast Trilogy and  Halldor Laxness's Independent People inspire similarly fanatical devotion in small groups of faithful  adherents.  In this case though, one of the devoted fans just happens to be the great novelist John  Fowles who proselytizes relentlessly for it, including writing the afterword to the edition I read, and  crediting it as the inspiration for his first novel, The Magus (itself a Modern Library Top 100 entry).  I don't know that I'm willing to join them yet, but all three of these cults may have a point.  At any  rate, The Wanderer, or, Le Grande Meaulnes, to give it the original French title, is certainly a unique  and wonderful book.<br />The Wanderer of the title is Augustin Meaulnes, a charismatic, restless, youth who transfers to Sainte  Agathe school in Sologne and befriends Francois Seurel, whose parents are teachers at the school.  Meaulnes quickly earns the nickname Le Grand, or The Great, both because of his height and because  he is the kind of natural leader who other boys flock to and emulate.  The author portrays the school  as an island, cut off from the rest of the world, and Meaulnes as the castaway who is most anxious to  get off.  He runs away several times and on one occasion has a mystical experience which will shape  the course rest of the rest of the boys' lives.<br />When Francois's grandparents come to visit, another boy is chosen to accompany the cart to town to  get them, but Meaulnes sneaks off in the carriage.  Irretrievably lost, he stumbles upon a pair of young  actors who take him to a dreamlike masquerade ball at a sumptuous estate.  There he meets Yvonne de  Galais, a beautiful young blonde, with whom he becomes hopelessly infatuated.  They spend only a  few moments together and do little more than exchange names, but this fairy tale adventure becomes  the pivotal experience of his life, one which he, with the help of Francois, will spend the rest of his  life trying to recapture, with tragic consequences.<br />Alain-Fournier was the pen name of Henri-Alban Fournier (there was another, already popular, writer  of the day named Henri Fournier.)  The novel is apparently very autobiographical :  his parents were  teachers; the boys supposedly incorporate aspects of his own character; and, most importantly, he had  an experience on June 5, 1905, wherein he, age 18, encountered a beautiful young woman named  Yvonne in the streets of Paris.  This event became a central moment in his life.  He imagined a parallel  reality, or Domain, which we only come in contact with during such transcendent moments and he  became obsessed with recapturing his.  This imbues his writing with a profound nostalgia, a  melancholic sense that those moments of epiphany that we experience can never be retrieved, that the  best parts of life lie behind us, not ahead.<br />Fournier was killed in battle on September 22, 1914, fighting on the Meuse.  Dead before his  twenty-eighth birthday, this was his only finished novel, though Fowles suggests that his letters are  also worth reading.  In a sense, this is a novel that we would have expected from someone who  survived WWI (see Rebecca West's Return of the Soldier), harkening back as it does to departed days  of youth.  His obsession with one event in his life suggests that Fournier might never have done much  more than rewrite this story in subsequent years, but it's useless to speculate.  What we do know is that  he left behind one poignant and haunting novel which, rightly or wrongly, captures the inchoate sense  of lost innocence and opportunity missed that we all feel at one time or another.  Masterpiece or not, it  is certainly unforgettable.<br />GRADE : Are becomes  the pivotal experience of his life, one which he, with the help of Francois, will spend the rest of his  life trying to recapture, with tragic consequences.<br />Alain-Fournier was the pen name of Henri-Alban Fournier (there was another, already popular, writer  of the day named Henri Fournier.)

When Trisha tries to get back on the Trail, she becomes disoriented and is quickly lost in the dense woods.  In the ensuing days she will be forced to fend for herself, armed with little more than some junk food, a poncho, a Walkman and a surpassing love for the Red Sox closer.  Battling bugs, bogs, hunger, malevolent woodland spirits and bears, she is sustained by listening to Red Sox games, by visitations from a spirit Gordon and by &quot;The Subaudible&quot;, as her father once described his impression of the divine in every day life.<br />There are a couple of things I really liked about this book.  First, it is one of the most feminist stories you'll ever read.  Trisha is the sole character for nearly the entire book.  She is determined and resourceful and easy to root for in her quest to survive.  Second, I liked the sustaining effect of the radio broadcast of the Sox games.  I am a huge fan of radio baseball; except in very rare cases, I would rather listen than watch.  As it happens, I listen to Sox games too.  Joe Castiglione and Jerry Trupiano are not terribly good broadcasters--especially if, like me, you grew up listening to Bob Murphy and Ralph Kiner do Mets games--but the rhythms of the game, the daily presence and the steady narrative flow over a period of months all combine to make them a welcome presence on Summer nights.  Baseball is the one sport that can be fully captured on radio, perhaps because it is so familiar that we can run the films in our minds and don't really need to see in order to &quot;see.&quot;  Whatever the reason, anyone who has a similar love of radio can easily relate to the comfort that the games provide this little lost girl.<br />There is, however, another aspect of the book which is much less successful, that is the spiritual angle.  Taken purely for what he is, Stephen King is one of the great storytellers in all of literature.  But that is pretty much all there is,  Critics have tried reading more into this book in particular, by taking Trisha's relationship with the Tom Gordon spirit and with the Subaudible to imply that King has found God or something.  Well, it is something, but it's not God.  We Red Sox fans are familiar with Gordon's religious devotion, which he demonstrates by pointing heavenward after every save.  Like her hero, Trisha determines that she will have to cultivate the quality of having &quot;ice water in her veins.&quot;  But Gordon, of course, derives his sublime confidence and self-assurance from his faith in God.  Trisha seemingly derives hers from faith in Gordon and the Subaudible alone.  If King's point is that traditional organized religions are all hogwash and faith of any kind suffices, even faith in a temporarily celebrated ballplayer, point taken.  But to suggest that the book offers any kind of profound new spiritual side of King seems to be quite a stretch.<br />In a way, this is somewhat disappointing.  King had an opportunity here to actually grapple with a weighty theme for once.  The book would be much better, and more significant, if Trisha's experience did forge in her some heightened spirituality.  Her adoration of Gordon could have been a leaping off point for her to consider why his religiosity provides him with such empowering spiritual sustenance.  Her fairly stock confrontation with the creature at the end of the book could have been replaced with a really interesting confrontation with the fact of her own possesion of a soul.  But King's not really interested in these ideas, which is of course his right.<br />Over all, I did like the book; it is helped greatly by the fact that it can be read in one sitting.  I particularly like the idea that thirty years from now you'll be able to pick up the book and recapture one fairly mediocre iteration of the Red Sox (though I found it enormously frustrating that Jason Varitek's name was repeatedly spelled &quot;Veritek.&quot;) and have a whole flood of memories come cascading down.

Originally published in The New Yorker in 1948, and a a staple of High School English classes ever since, it elicited some of the most spirited response in the history of that dowdy weekly.  The story is a stunning indictment of something but is sufficiently ambiguous that many different individuals and groups were able to take personal offense at its implications.<br />It would seem to me though, that there is a pretty conventional way of reading it; one that both touches upon a basic human truth and offers fairly little offense to anyone.  Take it at relative face value and the Lottery represents any human institution which is allowed to continue unchallenged and unconsidered until it becomes a destructive, rather than a constructive, force in men's lives..  After all, in the story, the reasons for holding the Lottery are long forgotten, other than the platitudinous &quot;Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon&quot;.  And the rituals connected to it, other than the making of participant lists, the use of the old ballot box and the swearing in, have mostly fallen by the wayside.  All that really remains is a rigid adherence to a hoary tradition.<br />Now folks can, of course, freight it with specific signifigances--read the whole thing as an attack on capitalism  or religion or small town conformity or agrarian culture or any of a number of different things.  But it seems to me that the most straightforward reading allows it to impact on all of those things.  Simply put, the fact that something has been done a certain way for a really long time does not necessarily justify its continuance.<br />If this powerfully disturbing story seems like too heavy a cudgel to wield to make such a self evident, unnuanced point, let's not underestimate how difficult it is to teach people anything.  After all, Plato has maintained the title of world's greatest philosopher for a few thousand years now on the basis of &quot;Know thyself&quot;.  So, why shouldn't Shirley grab a spot in the limelight for herself with a story that admonishes us to examine our civic rituals, especially since she couched her admonition in a great American gothic horror tale, which still retains its visceral power to shock us.<br />GRADE: Amate how difficult it is to teach people anything.

Scott Fitzgerald	In his astoundingly productive career, John O'Hara wrote 402 stories and 14 novels.  Reportedly, he drove fellow staffers at The New Yorker to fury because he could sit down at a typewriter and just bang away at the keys nonstop until a finished story rolled out.  (These facts come from John Sacret Young's intro to this book.)  I've read several of the story collections and a couple of the novels and O'Hara's style is fairly distinctive.  He plumbs the faultlines of society where the slumming rich meet with the aspiring poor.  His stories are driven by dialogue and crisp, witty, trenchant dialogue at that, much like the hard-boiled private eye novels of Hammett and Chandler.  His tone is cynical; his subjects doomed.  You get the sense that if he knew a pedestrian was about to be run down in front of him, he wouldn't even turn his head.  And after witnessing the accident he'd race to a typewriter to share the ugly scene with his readers.  He is a kind of an upscale noir writer, a tony purveyor of pulp fiction.<br />BUtterfield 8 is a roman a clef (based on a real incident) and you can see why the story appealed to him.  On June 8, 1931, the dead body of a young woman named Starr Faithfull--no seriously, her name was Starr Faithfull--was found on Long Beach, Long Island.  Subsequent reporting uncovered a life of easy morals and much time spent in speakeasies and such piquant details as her childhood molestation by a former mayor of Boston.  Despite rumors of political motives for her murder and a supposed secret diary, no one was ever charged in her death.<br />O'Hara recreates her as Gloria Wandrous, and introduces her on the novel's first page as follows:<br />  On this Sunday morning in May, this girl who later was to be the cause of a sensation in New York,  awoke much too early for her night before.  One minute she was asleep, the next she was  completely awake and dumped into despair.<br />This is no happy go lucky flapper he offers up.  From that first despairing morning, when she steals a mink coat from the apartment where she wakes in order to replace the dress that her date tore off of her the night before, O'Hara details a brutal, unhappy, ultimately empty life that spirals down towards the inevitable senseless death.<br />O'Hara said that in Gloria Wandrous he created Elizabeth Taylor before there was an Elizabeth Taylor (she starred in a movie version), just as in Pal Joey, he created Sinatra before Sinatra.  In hindsight, the better comparison is probably to Marilyn Monroe.  Regardless, his portrayal of a city girl on the edge, and of her eventual destruction, is iconographic and, if it did not create Taylor and Monroe, it certainly influenced writers from Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's) to Jay McInerney (Story of My Life).<br />I wouldn't recommend trying to tackle his entire ouvure in one fell swoop, but you should definitely try out this one, Appointment in Samarra, From the Terrace and some of the stories.  For my money, the incisive savagery with which he lays bare his generation should rank him with F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br />GRADE: B+t first despairing morning, when she steals a mink coat from the apartment where she wakes in order to replace the dress that her date tore off of her the night before, O'Hara details a brutal, unhappy, ultimately empty life that spirals down towards the inevitable senseless death. <br />O'Hara said that in Gloria Wandrous he created Elizabeth Taylor before there was an Elizabeth Taylor (she starred in a movie version), just as in Pal Joey, he created Sinatra before Sinatra.

Along with Robert Palmer (Deep Blues) and Greil Marcus (Mystery Train), he has helped to craft a still pretty slender body of literature which takes pop music and its impact seriously, but also places it within a larger societal context.  Now, in his two part biography of Elvis Presley, he has set out to strip away both the mythology (Volume One) and the demonology (Volume Two) that obscure Elvis and to restore some reasonable sense of perspective on the man and his music.  In so doing, he offers us a new and useful opportunity to understand the personal and societal forces that converged to make him into The King, one of the genuine cultural icons of the 20th Century, and to trigger the Rock &amp; Roll Era.<br />There are several main factors that Guralnick cites, which appear to have had a particular influence on how events transpired.  First is the city of Memphis itself, which served as a nearly perfect crucible for forging the blend of Gospel, Country, Blues and Rhythm &amp; Blues that made up Elvis's sound.  A southern city, but not Deep South, there was at least limited interaction between the white and black worlds.  But most importantly for this story, the city was saturated with music.  Second, Sam Phillips, owner of his own fledgling Sun Records operation, was on the scene looking for a white act that could bring the black sound to a mass audience:<br />  Sam Phillips possessed an almost Whitmanesque belief not just in the nobility of the American  dream but in the nobility of that dream as it filtered down to its most downtrodden citizen, the  Negro.  'I saw--I don't remember when, but I saw as a child--I thought to myself: suppose that I  would have been born black.  Suppose that I would have been born a little bit more down on the  economic ladder.  I think I felt from the beginning the total inequity of man's inhumanity to his  brother.  And it didn't take its place with me of getting up in the pulpit and preaching.  It took the  aspect with me that someday I would act on my feelings, I would show them on an individual,  one-to-one basis.'<br /> Finally, there was the man, actually he was more of a boy at the beginning, Elvis Presley.  And Elvis was himself the product of several forces.  There was the impoverished kind of white trash milieu from which Elvis came and which gave him a sense of alienation and otherness.  As Phillips said of him:<br />  He tried not to show it, but he felt so inferior.  He reminded me of a black man in that way; his  insecurity was so markedly like that of a black person.<br />Then there was his mother, Gladys, who--in addition to raising him to be polite, respectful, humble, even deferential--also gave him unconditional love, bordering on worship, which he returned in kind.  These forces combined, as so often seems to be the case, to make him insecure on the one hand, particularly in the manner in which he approached and dealt with people, but, on the other, left him burning with an inner certainty that he was special and was meant to accomplish great things.<br />All of these forces combined into a volatile mix in the Sun recording studios on July 5, 1954.  Phillips had brought Elvis in to work with a couple of local musicians, Scotty Moore and Bill Black, because he wanted them to do some ballads and Elvis had done some demos there, which Philips was not overwhelmed by but he thought Elvis had some potential as a ballad singer.  The session was pretty desultory, if not downright unsuccessful, until that inevitable, now mythical, moment when during a break Elvis started fooling around doing Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup's old blues tune &quot;That's All Right [Mama]&quot;.  Phillips, initially shocked that this quiet white mama's boy even new the song, immediately recognized that this was just the type of thing that he had been looking for and got them to record it.<br />All of the tumblers had clicked into place.  It was the nature of Memphis that Elvis and Sam had been exposed to, more like drenched in, the music of the black community.  Sam happened to be looking for someone who could transport that music and, most importantly, the style and atmospherics of the music, into the white community.  And in walks Elvis, that quintessential hybrid of insecurity and manifest destiny.<br />If success did not come overnight it did come quickly and Guralnick masterfully charts the meteoric rise that took them up the charts and took Elvis to television and then to Hollywood.  This first volume also sees Colonel Parker take over from Sam, the purchase of Graceland, the eventual breakup of the original band, the death of Elvis's mother and his induction into the Army.  Guralnick makes it all seem fresh and exciting, carrying the reader along on the tide of events.  An incredible number of famous names stud the narrative and prove to have significant roles to play, including:  Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Hank Snow, B.B. King, Sammy Davis, Jr., Eddy Arnold, Bill Monroe, Steve Allen, Milton Berle and, of course, Ed Sullivan.  This is a great biography, one that should especially appeal to folks whose only image of Elvis is the fat, sweaty, drug-addled lounge lizard of popular caricature.<br />GRADE: Aa]&quot;.

But he has, either consciously or no, limited himself to being only that; he is content to simply tell stories without trying to imbue them with any depth or signifigance.  His well chronicled shortcomings, overuse of pop product placements, weak endings to most of his books, etc., are annoying, but they are not fatal.  The thing that keeps him from being considered a really first class writer is his general unwillingness to grapple with serious ideas in his fiction, or, when he does deal with them, to simply put his own gloss on classic concepts.  Pet Sematary amply illustrates all of his strengths and weaknesses.<br />Dr. Louis and Rachel Creed and their two children, Ellie (5 years old) and Gage (a year old), have just moved to Ludlow, ME.  They live on a surprisingly busy road for such a rural setting, but there's a thriving local chemical company.  Jud Crandall, an aged neighbor, befriends Louis and shares beers and local lore with him. Then when Ellie's cat, Church, is killed, Jud shares the darkest bit of local lore; the nearby &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; is actually capable of regenerating life.  Louis hoping to avoid breaking Ellie's heart, decides to bring Church back to life, but the horrid smelling misshapen beast that comes back from the grave is pretty creepy.  The rest of the story is pretty obvious--Louis will inevitably bring back a person, with catastrophic results for all.<br />The reason that King sells a kajillion books is because he makes the whole thing grippingly creepy, striking just the right balance between the peacefulness and the mystery of his bucolic setting. Supposedly, King put the book aside several times while he was writing it because it was scaring even him.  And it is truly scary at times.  But overall the book will not stand even mild critical scrutiny.  First, it is totally predictable--as soon as the secret power of the cemetery is revealed, you know exactly where the plot is headed (for the thickheaded, there's even the added element that Rachel Creed can not deal with the concept that those she loves will one day die).  Second, perhaps he's his own worst enemy, but King makes the reborn cat so creepy, that I didn't buy someone trying to do the same for a loved one.  The key to any good horror story is, of course, to keep the audience on your side so that they are willing to suspend their disbelief, but his grip starts to slip here and, after a reasonably good set up, the book sort of tails off to it's gory conclusion as even King seems to lose interest.<br />But the most important weakness is that the whole thing seems derivative and devoid of fresh ideas.  It reads like a grab bag of elements ranging from Frankenstein to The Monkey's Paw.  The central premise of trying to return animation to dead flesh is so well trodden that unless you have some startlingly original twist to put on it, perhaps it is best left alone.<br />Final Verdict:  a perfectly acceptable airplane or beach book, but it's not likely to provoke any thought nor to linger long in your mind.<br />GRADE: C+exactly where the plot is headed (for the thickheaded, there's even the added element that Rachel Creed can not deal with the concept that those she loves will one day die).

After all, if it weren't for fare like this, what would we do for beach &amp; airplane books?  Luckily there are guys like Nelson DeMille cranking them out.  DeMille, who won a Bronze Star in Viet Nam, has written a couple of excellent books, I especially liked By the Rivers of Babylon and Cathedral, though I've read some others that I didn't like as much.  I'd recommend this one.<br />General's Daughter opens with Captain Ann Campbell, a West Point honors graduate and daughter of the general of the base, staked out, raped and strangled in an artillery field.  Wisecracking investigator Paul Brenner of the Criminal Investigation Division and rape specialist Cynthia Sunhill, his former lover, team up to solve the crime.  Turns out the General's daughter has a pretty sordid past, which makes just about every male at Fort Hadley a suspect.  This profusion of suspects combines with normal Army red tape and extraordinary reticence about scandal, to form the basis of a briskly plotted procedural.<br />The solution to the mystery is pretty pedestrian and Brenner's a little too much of a wise guy, but the story hums along and DeMille does us all a favor by not piling on multiple melodramatic conclusions.  He tells his story and then wraps it up neatly.  The one thing I really liked was Brenner's righteous indignation at the despicable conduct of his Army brethren.  At least in this novel, the sense of military honor is not dead.<br />Accept this novel on its own terms and you'll enjoy it.<br />GRADE: B-	2000-10-13

Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse fits squarely and delightfully in this tradition.  If you've never seen the TV series on PBS and A&amp;E, or better yet read one of the books, you're really missing out on something special.<br />Morse, whose first name wasn't revealed for years, is an Oxford-educated, beer-drinking, Opera-loving, vintage Jaguar-driving, Crossword puzzle maven and also one of the biggest curmudgeons in all of literature.  He does not suffer fools gladly, other than his much put upon but continually bemused partner Lewis.  His superiors are forced to tolerate his idiosyncrasies and his bibliousness because he also has a uniquely intuitive mind and a knack for solving the most puzzling crimes.  In an interesting symbiosis, John Thaw's television portrayal of Morse bled over into the novels and took some of the harsher edges off of the character and Kevin Whatley's Lewis helped to make the character less of a dolt and more of a naïf in the books too.<br />In this Gold Dagger winning installment in the series, Morse is on an unwelcome holiday when he gets drawn into the case of a year old disappearance of a Swedish girl who is assumed to have been murdered and ditched in the local woods.  The largely moribund investigation is reinvigorated when The Times receives a cryptic letter with tantalizing but ambiguous literary clues to the dead girl's whereabouts.  As the story unfolds Morse finds himself in the midst of a murder investigation that includes everything from pornography to ornithology.  As always, the book offers both a satisfying mystery and the great pleasure of watching Morse and Lewis interact with one another and with suspects, superiors and the various ladies who inevitably tweak Morse's heartstrings.<br />After a highly successful run of 13 novels, Dexter killed Morse off earlier this year in  The Remorseful Day.  On the one hand, it's nice to see an author finish a series while he still has his fastball, but Morse and Lewis will be missed.

Cliff Janeway starts out as a Denver homicide detective, but Dunning wisely contrives to get him out on his own.  Even when he's with the police though, he's none to powerful.  He does not have an amoral partner backing him up.  He's unlucky at love and he's not an epicure.  He's tough, but he has sense enough to be scared of the folks who are truly dangerous.  In short, Janeway is a throwback to the lone wolf investigators of yore.<br />But then there's the unique twist that makes what could have been merely a good series into a fascinating one : Cliff Janeway is a bookman.  He collects first editions of American Literature, with a particular interest in Faulkner, and in recent years has given increasing thought to becoming a book dealer himself.  Ultimately, when circumstances force him to leave the police department, he does indeed open his own store, Twice Told Books.<br />Without taking anything away from the book as a mystery, it really derives it's energy from the world of book collecting.  The book is set in 1986, so the prices cited must be hopelessly outdated, but when he talks about first editions of Stephen King's novel Salem's Lot going from $10 to $100 in the space of just ten years, that's an attention grabber.  It's especially interesting that the books of horror authors like King and popular authors, like Anne Tyler, have already increased so much in value.  I recognize that normal people don't spend the amount of time that I do looking for good, cheap books, but I guarantee that as you read about the details of book collecting, you'll be glancing up at your own bookshelves to see if your's are first editions (with the dust jacket, and not Book of the Month Club editions.)<br />Thanks to this unique angle and the character filled bookman's subculture in which it's set, this is one of the better mysteries series of recent years.<br />GRADE : A	2000-10-13

Here's a typical comment from Weekly Wire:<br />  Hot young actor Ethan Hawke's first novel, The Hottest State, is mostly reminiscent of what used  to pass for literary writing in the 1980s: a first person narrative of a vapid young man living in  New York City, told without allusion, metaphor or self-reference. Essentially, the kind of  airport-novel-taken-as-art for which Jay McInerney and Brett Easton Ellis were once praised, and  then later reviled.<br />Bad enough to be hammered like that, but to be lumped with the truly awful Bret Easton Ellis?  Ouch!  Perhaps it was simply the jealousy that authors always seem to feel towards successful fellow writers.  Perhaps it was a generational thing; who was this punk kid to replace Hemingway's wine drenched Paris with a coke sprinkled New York?  And, of course, his own generation was hardly going to defend an author who told them that they were all shallow and wasting their lives.  Whatever the cause, the literary establishment has been so aggressively dismissive of him and this novel that liking it feels almost like a guilty pleasure.  But I do like it very much.<br />The book is unusual in that it is written in the second person, which, combined with the tone, makes the whole thing read, appropriately,  like an admonishment.  It opens in a Manhattan night spot with the line:  &quot;You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning.&quot;  But, of course, that is exactly the type of person that the nameless protagonist of the novel has become, hopping from night club to night club, looking for cocaine and women, with &quot;no goal higher than pursuit of pleasure.&quot;  He alternately avoids and seeks out his friend Tad Allagash (Tad calls the hero Coach, so we will too) because Tad represents the worst of his own personal tendencies, but is also a ready source of drugs.  Coach is well on his way to blowing his job at a magazine that is a hilarious put on of the The New Yorker, with burned out writers haunting the hallways.  Eventually he is fired after turning in an error filled piece on France that he was supposed to be fact checking.  We also discover that his wife Amanda has recently abandoned him to pursue her modeling career.  Coach has taken to wandering by a department store window that has a dress dummy modeled after her.  Over the course of several days of avoiding responsibilities and the brother who is trying to contact him, abusing coke &amp; booze at every waking moment, the remainder of Coach's life collapses around him.<br />McInerney's portrait of these young New Yorkers is truly devastating; they are all surface with no depth.  Coach remains friendly with Tad because:<br />  Just now you want to stay at the surface of things, and Tad is a figure skater who never considers  the sharks under the ice.  You have friends who actually care about you and speak the language of  the inner self.  You have avoided them of late.  Your soul is as disheveled as your apartment, and  until you clean up a little you don't want to invite anyone inside.<br />Coach had doubts about marrying Amanda because:<br />  You did not feel that you could open quite all of your depths to her, or fathom hers, and sometimes  you feared she didn't have any depths.<br />Meanwhile, he finds himself asking, &quot;when did she become a mannequin?&quot;, because she is little different than her fiberglass doppelganger in the store display.  When he meets her in a nightclub at the end of the novel, she is with an impossibly handsome young man who she claims is her fianc&eacute;, but he turns out to be an escort.  The woman Coach is dancing with that night turns out to be transsexual.  Noone is real, like the neon lighting in which their lives unfold everything is artificial; at best they are playing roles, at worst they are truly empty at the core (they have become the &quot;Men without Chests&quot; that C.S. Lewis warned of).  Coach himself frames the episodes in his life as chapters from a novel, complete with titles.  It's as if he is incapable of handling reality and must make a fiction of his own life, must turn himself into a literary construct.<br />Finally, as he hits bottom, Coach begins to rebound.  His brother catches up to him and they discuss the loss of their Mother, who sickened and died a year earlier.  Coach is, at last, able to confront his own sense of loss.  He calls an old girlfriend and tells her: &quot;I was just thinking that we have a responsibility to the dead--the living, I mean.&quot;  The novel ends with him down at the docks, trading his sunglasses for some fresh baked bread.  Hard to avoid pedantry here, but the bread pretty obviously represents the Staff of Life, the values of the heartland and the pleasures of hearth and home, as well as a means of resurrection--in the most fundamental sense, he is taking communion.  Coach's decision to abandon the bright lights (he won't need the sunglasses anymore) and turn back towards the basics is a triumphal moment in modern fiction.<br />In an era when &quot;white bread&quot; has become pejorative, an author who has his hero saved by a bread roll is obviously trying to communicate something.

Noone is real, like the neon lighting in which their lives unfold everything is artificial; at best they are playing roles, at worst they are truly empty at the core (they have become the &quot;Men without Chests&quot; that C.S. Lewis warned of).  Coach himself frames the episodes in his life as chapters from a novel, complete with titles.  It's as if he is incapable of handling reality and must make a fiction of his own life, must turn himself into a literary construct. <br />Finally, as he hits bottom, Coach begins to rebound.  His brother catches up to him and they discuss the loss of their Mother, who sickened and died a year earlier.  Coach is, at last, able to confront his own sense of loss.   He calls an old girlfriend and tells her: &quot;I was just thinking that we have a responsibility to the dead--the living, I mean.&quot;  The novel ends with him down at the docks, trading his sunglasses for some fresh baked bread.  Hard to avoid pedantry here, but the bread pretty obviously represents the Staff of Life, the values of the heartland and the pleasures of hearth and home, as well as a means of resurrection--in the most fundamental sense, he is taking communion.  Coach's decision to abandon the bright lights (he won't need the sunglasses anymore) and turn back towards the basics is a triumphal moment in modern fiction. <br />In an era when &quot;white bread&quot; has become pejorative, an author who has his hero saved by a bread roll is obviously trying to communicate something.  It would be a shame if those same shallow folk whom the book is aimed at were to succeed in dismissing it as no more than a &quot;drug book&quot;.

Unfortunately, I think that this is something of a misfire for Watkins, who is pretty nearly my favorite writer.<br />This is his sixth novel and, like each of the previous books, it opens up a new world in a level of detail that is truly remarkable (Watkins notoriously immerses himself in the milieu of his subject before writing his books).  This time the setting is the Northwoods of Maine, where mill owner Noah McKenzie has been granted logging rights to a stand of trees, the Algonquin Wilderness, in the days before it becomes a nature preserve.  McKenzie is a figure of Ahab like obsession, determined to clear cut the forest where he lost a leg in a wood cutting accident years before.  Arrayed against him are: the woman who owns the local environmentally conscious newspaper; an ecoterrorist named Adam Gabriel who is driven by the environmental destruction he saw in the burning oilfields of Kuwait; the foreman of his mill; and even his own wife.  As Gabriel escalates his monkey wrenching tactics, McKenzie turns to a mercenary friend and soon enough there is open warfare in the woods.  Lurking in the dark like a deus ex machina is a grizzled old seemingly unkillable bear that the locals call No Ears.<br />Now, as you can see from the myriad elements that are brought together here, there's just a little too much room for melodrama and, indeed, there are points when the story slides over the edge into unbelievability.  But my real complaint is that Watkins, who is normally a more subtle author, has really stacked the moral deck.  Rather than have McKenzie and Gabriel meet as idealistic moral equals, Watkins tips his hand from the get go and portrays McKenzie as a malevolent force, hell bent on destruction for it's own sake.  Setting aside my own political inclination to cut the mill owner some slack, I think it would simply be a more interesting story if McKenzie were more ambiguous, if it were harder to choose sides in the explosive showdown.<br />But as I said, I'm willing to go a little easy on these complaints because I've liked Watkin's prior works so much and even amidst the facets I disliked, there is much to like here.<br />GRADE: B-McKenzie as a malevolent force, hell bent on destruction for it's own sake.

So Inspector Ian Rutledge is plopped down into the middle of a politically charged murder investigation.  Compounding his difficulties is the fact that Rutledge himself suffered an emotional collapse after being buried in a trench during the War.  Now, unknown to all, he is continually accompanied by an internal voice, named Hamish, that belittles him and exacerbates his war guilt.<br />Rutledge makes for an interesting and sympathetic detective and it is unusual to find a period mystery that actually acknowledges the War, let alone probes so deeply into the psychic damage left in its wake.  And Rutledge was profoundly effected:<br />  Before the war it had been the case  that drove him night and day--partly from a gritty determination  that murderers must be found and punished.  He had believed deeply in that, with the single-minded  idealism of youth and a strong sense of moral duty towards victims, who could no longer speak for  themselves.  But the war had altered his viewpoint, had shown him that the best of men could kill,  given the right circumstances, as he himself had done over and over again.  Not only the enemy, but  his own men, sending them out too be slaughtered even when he had known beyond doubt that they  would die and that the order to advance was madness.<br />Rutledge's empathy for suspects and victims alike is appealing and his running battle with Hamish adds a real tension to the story.  But the pacing of the story is a little stately and the key plot twist is a tad obvious.  Still, it's a good first effort and I'm willing to read the next in the series to see if Todd improves.<br />GRADE: C+ee if Todd improves. <br />GRADE: C+	2000-10-13

A man is hired to give advice to the readers of a newspaper.  The  job is a circulation stunt and the whole staff considers it a joke.  He welcomes the job, for it might  lead to a gossip column, and anyway he's tired of being a leg man.  He too considers the job a joke,  but after several months at it, the joke begins to escape him.  He sees that the majority of the letters  are profoundly humble pleas for moral and spiritual advice, that they are inarticulate expressions of  genuine suffering.  He also discovers that his correspondents take him seriously.  For the first time  in his life, he is forced to examine the values by which he lives.  This examination shows him that  he is the victim of the joke and not its perpetrator.  -Nathanael West (Miss Lonelyhearts)<br />Miss Lonelyhearts has been hired as a wiseacre stunt, to dispense snide advice to yokels. But in the face of their pain and their need for answers, the empty piffle that he serves up begins to eat away at his soul.  The whole thing is supposed to be an elaborate put on, so his editor won't let him give the real answers that he longs to share, that Christ and the word of God are the only solutions to their problems.  The result: &quot;By avoiding God, he had failed to tap the force in his heart and had merely written a column for his paper.&quot;  Lonelyhearts, plagued by his failure to help his correspondents, retreats into dreams before almost inevitably enacting a kind of messianic tragedy, ending in the obligatory crucifix scene.<br />Nathanael West here addresses the central dilemma facing modern man; having abandoned God, where do people turn for answers?  What values, what morals, remain to provide structure for men's lives?  West is unambiguous in answering these questions.  He makes it clear that there is nothing that can fill these vital roles.  The compelling image here is of modern men and women as a series of completely isolated lonely hearts, unable to share in the love of God, and, therefore, unable to love one another.<br />This is a brief but savage attack on the emptiness of modern life.  It seems to me a much better novel than Day of the Locust  which, of course, made the Modern Library Top 100; the themes are more universal and the message retains its power.  It is as timely today, as it was when it was published over 60 years ago.  If West has a masterpiece, I remain ambivalent on this point, this is it.<br />GRADE: Bries of completely isolated lonely hearts, unable to share in the love of God, and, therefore, unable to love one another. <br />This is a brief but savage attack on the emptiness of modern life.

But this book joins David McCullough's Truman, Arthur Schlesinger's A Thousand Days  and Robert Dallek's LBJ biography to complete the set of hagiographies of the pre-Carter Democrat Presidents.  It is an extremely lightweight, but very readable account of the Roosevelts during the War years.  It is ideal for anyone who wants a glossy portrait of the topic and does not want to have any of their preconceptions called into question. <br />As the book opens, in May 1940, we are presented with the truly bizarre menagerie that was the Roosevelt White House.  Franklin and Eleanor have separate bedrooms--and have been estranged since Eleanor found out about his affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918.  Missy LeHand, FDR's &quot;secretary &amp; hostess&quot;,lives on the third floor.  Lorena Hickcock, Eleanor's &quot;special friend&quot; lives in the bedroom across the hall from the first lady.  Sara Roosevelt, FDR's mother, is frequently on hand, as are Harry Hopkins (FDR's friend &amp; Eleanor's ally), Joe Lash (the young left-winger &amp; future biographer who Eleanor loves), Princess Martha of Norway (who FDR shares intimate moments with), and on and on...  But Goodwin assures us that all of these relationships are perfectly straightforward and innocent. <br />Goodwin briefly describes FDR's childhood.  She trots out the well worn story of his domineering mother, his blackballing by the Porcellian Club at Harvard, etc. All of which leave him with an &quot;anxiety to please&quot;.  However, she never really connects the dots &amp; explores how this trait (a weakness/strength that he shares with Reagan and Clinton), and it's resulting tendency to dither over decisions, lead him to needlessly hurt &amp; confuse people.  Instead the chaos that attended his governing style and his personal relationships is presented as a kind of intentional creative force. <br />Of course, FDR's paralysis from polio is presented as the formative experience in his life.  It is hard to imagine that it would not shape his character somehow, but did it have a beneficial effect?  She accepts Eleanors statement that, &quot;Anyone who has gone through great suffering is bound to have a greater  sympathy and understanding of the problems of mankind.&quot;  This is balderdash. They're likely to understand the suffering of others who are crippled.  But the great mass of mankind is not handicapped and if his polio led FDR to govern as if all men are dependents, this is something that needs to be examined and dealt with.  Instead we are assured that FDR had a special understanding, that you and  I don't have, because of his disease.    <br />In the nation meanwhile, eight years of the New Deal has still left the country with a 17% unemployment rate.  But Goodwin assures us that the New Deal has been a resounding success.  And now a second crisis (the War) approaches which is even more fearful than the first (the Depression).  What can she possibly mean by this?  In what sense was World War II, especially in it's early stages, a  dire crisis for America?  We were never seriously threatened.  There was never a chance of the Nazis winning &amp; holding power in Europe.  What crisis? <br />Suppose it was a crisis, why did it take FDR two years to get us into the War?  (Even then, only the bombing of Pearl Harbor made it possible.)  If FDR was a great leader, why were these leadership skills not evident prior to December 7, 1941. <br />At any rate, War in Europe rages.  FDR faces a decision that fairly few President's ever faced.  Should he run for a third term.  Now George Washington was one of the few who could actually have won a third term, but he considered it more important that the Nation be governed by laws and not men, so he stepped down.  Following his example, no other President had stood for a third election.  But Goodwin barely acknowledges the fact that FDR's decision to run was a significant step on the way to the Imperial Presidency which finally came a cropper under JFK, LBJ &amp; Nixon. <br />Later, when FDR actually runs &amp; wins a fourth term, she not only ignores this issue, she ignores the fact that he was a dying man, with little chance of finishing his term.  It was an act of extraordinary irresponsibility to put the country in a position where it would be governed by a virtual unknown in time of war.  But by this time, as one observer remarked &quot;...he had ceased to be a person; he was simply the president.  If something was good for him, it was good; if it had no function for him as president, it didn't exist.&quot; <br />Here are a few other issues that warrant fuller treatment: <br />1) Did the internment of the Japanese flow from something within FDR?  He often used hateful language in describing those, like the America Firsters, who disagreed with him.  Was he prone to seeing the Japanese as enemies, because it was easy for him to imagine enemies? <br />2) What was the point of taking Europe away from the Nazis and giving it to the Soviets?  Was that his intent? <br />3)  When the war ended US debt was 127% of GNP.  If our current debt of maybe 60% is so awful, as I'm sure she argued during the Reagan years, then how could he have saddled us with twice that amount? <br />4)  FDR used the Greer incident to justify convoying British ships.  He claimed that a U-boat fired on the US ship Greer without provocation.  This was a lie and as Goodwin points out, it bore bitter fruit in the Tonkin Gulf.  But isn't such deceitfulness an integral part of FDR's career?  He cheated on Eleanor (understandably perhaps, since she once told a daughter that sex was &quot;an ordeal to be borne&quot;), lied about his marriage, lied about his physical condition, etc. Wasn't lying his modus operandi? <br />Goodwin answers none of these questions, &amp; for the most part doesn't raise them, because it's probably  never occurred to her to ask them.She began work on this book believing the Roosevelts were demi-gods, but found she'd underestimated them. <br />As a general proposition, I'd recommend the book for those of limited intellectual curiosity. <br />GRADE: C+	2000-10-13

His first book, Night Over Day Over Night, published when he was just 23, was nominated for the Booker Prize.  Since then he has added a series of excellent novels and one brilliant memoir, Stand Before Your God, that have earned him the reputation of a modern Hemingway or Conrad.  His work certainly warrants these lofty comparisons and his omission from Granta's Twenty Best Writers Under Forty casts a shadow on the whole list.<br />Promise of Light opens, in 1921, with Ben Sheridan taking a ferry back to his home in Jamestown, Rhode Island.  He has just secured a long sought job in a bank and his whole future seems open before him.  But by the end of the night, his fireman father will lie dead as the result of a blood transfusion from Ben, which reveals that Ben was not his son.  In fulfillment of his &quot;father's&quot; dying wish, Ben takes his ashes back to Ireland, where he hopes to discover his real parents.  But before he even reaches land, he is embroiled in the bloody Irish Rebellion, as it turns out that his father was a legendary IRA gunrunner who, like a figure out of myth, was expected to return one day.<br />Watkins brilliantly combines Ben's search for his true identity with rousing action sequences, indeed the final fifty pages of the book depict a running battle between Ben's band of IRA gunmen and the dread English Black and Tans as they race to the farmhouse where the man Ben now believes to be his father is holed up.<br />The comparisons of Watkins and Hemingway are based on both the settings of his novels (in wartime, on fishing boats, in Africa) and the clarity of his prose.  Here he describes Ben's reaction to the death, in battle, of a lobsterman named Tarbox:<br />  I knelt with the others, dew soaking through my trousers, and I tried to remember a prayer.  But  nothing came to mind, not even a song.  All I could think of were Tarbox's bright-painted crab-pot  floats, bobbing in the water off Lahinch.  And now Mrs. Fuller's words sank into me, about whole  generations dying out.  I saw how it would be.  Tarbox's wife would move away and their  tin-roofed shack would fold back into the earth.  There would be no children to inherit the land and  keep the name alive.  The faint scratches that Tarbox had left on the earth would be rubbed out by a  year or two of wind and rain.<br />  I had not liked him much.  If he had lived and I'd gone back home again, I would not have  remembered him kindly.  But now I cried for Tarbox and for his wife, because I had been jealous of  how much they were in love.<br />The reasons for comparison to Conrad are evident in his description of the brutal fanatic leader of the IRA cell that Ben joins up with:<br />  I couldn't imagine a childhood for Clayton.  I couldn't imagine him younger or older or any way  except the way he was now.  To me, Clayton had begun to make sense.  He didn't try, like the  others, to live as if the war could be forgotten from time to time in the dark-paneled walls of  Gisby's pub or in front of a fire at night.  Clayton lived in black and white.  He saw no boundary to  violence.  The war never quit and his instincts for war never rested.  he had no other instincts.  Everything else had been put away in a warehouse in his mind.  he claimed no friends or love of  family because he could be hurt by people who hurt them.<br />Such are the men that Conrad warned us of, time and again.<br />The other thing that makes Watkins' work exceptional, is a moral core which seems increasingly rare in our society, never mind in our literature and culture in general.  His characters recognize that their actions have consequences and behave as if they cared about those consequences.  They are capable of making ethical judgments--a quality that seems to be disappearing elsewhere.<br />I urge anyone who is not familiar with the work of this great young author to remedy that situation post haste.<br />GRADE: A+anyone who is not familiar with the work of this great young author to remedy that situation post haste. <br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-13

You'll recall that this is the book that investigators were trying to prove that Monica had purchased for the President at a local bookstore, Kramerbooks.  The book especially interested investigators because it is a tale of phone sex, which Lewinsky and the President were said to have engaged in frequently.  This background merely serves to add another layer of pity to this technically accomplished and quite funny but genuinely sad story of dysfunctional disaffected souls.<br />Jim, who lives on the West Coast, and  Abby, who lives somewhere in the East, have both called a phone sex service and as the novel opens, they have moved to a one-to-one private line.  Baker's technical achievement lies in the fact that the entire novel consists of one phone conversation between the two.  The comedy lies in the situation itself, the ridiculous fantasies that the two spin and the numerous quirky asides and observations that the two come up with.  But the whole thing is a terrible sad statement about the participants in this conversation in particular, people like them on a more general level and a society that seems to be producing more and more citizens like them. Because these people are not forming any kind of relationship here, in fact, they are not even really listening to one another.  Each is merely a prop in the others warped sexual dream world.<br />Alan Turing, the renowned British codebreaker and one of the fathers of Artificial Intelligence theory, proposed a test for when we could consider the computer to have achieved actual intelligence: when a human could not tell whether he was communicating with another human or with a machine, that machine would have to be considered intelligent.  It is disconcerting to eavesdrop on the conversation between Jim and Abby, because: 1) it is just barely conversation and more like competing monologues; 2)  it is impossible to know whether either or both of them are serious, they could equally likely be paid employees of the sex service; and 3) they are so selfish and disconnected from one another that either or both could be a machine, preprogrammed to spew forth stock scenarios.  Additionally, the two voices bleed into one another and it becomes difficult to tell, which is speaking because they never emerge as individuals with unique personas.  In fact, Baker said of the novel:<br />  The idea was to have one character fizzle out with a story and yet have someone else there who'd  take it up, turn it, and maybe even twist it away from the intention of the person who started. It  becomes antiphonal. The characters were competing with each other in a way, showing off. And  of course they're both really me. Or I'd ask my wife questions, that's the sort of thing writers do.  The sordid truth is you walk out of your office and say, &quot;Well, what would you say if I said this or  that?&quot; and your wife says, &quot;No, I wouldn't say that.&quot; Then I tell her, &quot;Thank you,&quot; and walk back  into my office.<br />He may have started out with a novel about two people at least trying to share a sexual experience, however masturbatory.  But he ended up delivering a much more personal fantasia and it certainly seems that the two characters are simply different aspects of his own psyche.<br />The cover blurbs, of course, declare this to be a ground breaking, breath taking, erotic experience (see the definition of erotic above), but there is definitely no love present here, except a profoundly damaged kind of self-love.  Nor is there any real desire; each character has all that they desire in the palm of their hand.  And it is hard to see how readers would be aroused by the intensely individualistic fantasy lives described. Rather than an erotic novel, it is a clinical description of a rather pathetic pathology and the thought that the President of the United States engaged in this kind of thing is fairly frightening.<br />GRADE: Ct that the President of the United States engaged in this kind of thing is fairly frightening. <br />GRADE: C	2000-10-13

But I'd managed to avoid reading one because of  their generic Ludlumesque titles--Omega Deception, Doomsday Spiral, Gamma  Option, etc.  But this book grabbed my attention.  With the end of the Cold War,  the Middle East seems to offer the most fertile ground for thriller writers.  Land has savvily set his 19th novel in the newly independent Palestinian West  Bank.  The story follows Ben Kamal, an American Arab policeman who has returned  to his homeland to help train the Palestinian Police Forces,  and Danielle  Barnea, a female Shin Bet agent, as they join forces to track down a serial  killer, Al-Dib &quot;The Wolf&quot;.<br />This book is a marvel.  It contains all that is best and worst in current  writing.  Land's story is exciting and the plot rockets forward.  The characters  are extremely likable.  The opposition that Kamal and Barnea face from their own  bosses &amp; from a hostile populace add a terrific layer of tension.  However, the  book also has about three endings &amp; just keeps going on &amp; on; it would be much  better less 75 pages.  And it contains one of the most annoying creatures in  modern detective fiction, the rogue hero, in this case ex-Colonel Frank  Brickland,  who will do the dirty work that our central heroes can not do--think  of Hawk in the Spenser series.<br />With all that, I think if you're about to get on an airplane &amp; you're looking  for a good, quick, big-print read, you won't do much better than this one.<br />GRADE:  C+	2000-10-13

It beats old age, disease, or falling down  the cellar stairs.  To be a Gringo in Mexico--ah, that is euthanasia!  -Ambrose Bierce in a letter to a friend<br />In 1914, the great American journalist and short story writer  Ambrose Bierce, age 71, traveled to a Mexico that was in the midst of Revolution and promptly disappeared.  He thereby fulfilled the dark prediction above and provided one of the great literary mysteries of the 20th Century.<br />In The Old Gringo, Carlos Fuentes offers his take on Bierce's fate.  An &quot;Old Gringo&quot;, carrying just a couple of his own books, a copy of Don Quixote, a clean shirt and a Colt .44, joins a group of Mexican rebels under General Tomas Arroyo.  In turn, they meet up with a young American school teacher named Harriet Winslow, who was supposed to tutor the children of the wealthy landowner who illegally holds Arroyo's family property.  The three become enmeshed in an unlikely romantic triangle, which necessarily ends in tragedy.<br />Fuentes uses the story to explore a plethora of themes, some of which I followed and some of which I could not.  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is the degree to which it reflects Latin American obsession with the United States, an obsession which it must be admitted is met by only a fleeting interest on our part.  Fuentes and the tragic chorus of Mexican characters elevate the tale of the Old Gringo to the status of myth; ironic, since Bierce is barely remembered here, but then one of his themes is that we are a people without memory, while the very soil of Mexico carries memories.<br />It all adds up to a diverting speculation about an interesting historical puzzle, but I'm not sure that the story will bear all of the psychological and political weight that Fuentes loads upon it.<br />GRADE: C+ADE: C+	2000-10-13

Rosalind Leigh is commissioned to write a book about Olive Martin, an obese young woman, known as The Sculptress after hacking up her mother and sister with an ax and rearranging the pieces.  Now all she carves is little wax figurines in her prison cell, including one of Rosalind after their first interview.  At this and subsequent interviews, Olive convinces Rosalind that she did not actually commit the crime, this in spite of her own confession and a mountain of evidence.  Of course, as Rosalind starts to dig into the facts of the case, she finds herself in mounting danger.<br />It all sounds painfully standard I know, but it made for a very good BBC adaptation which was shown here on PBS and the book is terrific too.  As always in these things, Olive is the most interesting character in the book, but her relationship with Rosalind is especially well done and there are enough surprises to offset the somewhat formulaic basic plot.<br />GRADE: C+	2000-10-13

In fact, he virtually created the modern mystery tale, wrote excellent poetry &amp; many of the images from his horror stories have passed into the iconography of our culture--recall the Tell Tale Heart episode of Cheers, with Diane following Carla around going, boom--boom, boom-boom,....<br />One of the beauties of Poe is that, since his work was all poetry &amp; short stories, you can get everything in a one volume addition like this one.  I'll just look at a couple of examples:<br />The Murders in the Rue Morgue:<br />With this tale, Poe created the detective story.  The narrator is a friend of C. Auguste Dupin in earl 1800's Paris.  Dupin is gifted with a great intellect &amp; comes of an illustrious family, but has been reduced to poverty and has shrunken into indolence. However, reading about a particularly brutal murder in Rue Morgue, he is stirred into action &amp; he &amp; the narrator set out to solve the  crime.<br />All of the elements that have become so familiar to us are present here; a locked room, a bizarre killing, a brilliant but eccentric detective, an incredulous sidekick, bumbling police, etc..  Most important, the crime is solved by the rigorous application of reason.  In Dupin we see the forerunner of everyone from Sherlock Holmes to Nero Wolfe.<br />The Cask of Amantillado:<br />The story is off &amp; running from the first paragraph:<br />THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could,  but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well  know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave  utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a  point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which  it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish but  punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution  overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger  fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.  It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given  Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my in to  smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my to smile now was at  the thought of his immolation.<br />He had a weak point --this Fortunato --although in other regards  he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his  connoisseurship in wine.<br />Taking off from this brisk setup, Poe treats us to one of the really diabolical tales of vengeance in all of literature.  This one will trouble your sleep.<br />And, of course, your teacher taught you poetry by reading your class The Bells, The Raven and Annabel Lee.  I bet you still remember learning the word tintinnabulation.  They're all here &amp; they're all just as morbid and scary as you remember them.<br />GRADE: A+is unredressed when retribution  overtakes its redresser.

Then in 1933 he created Perry Mason for The Case of the Velvet Claws.  Some 80 further Perry Mason adventures followed, most serialized in the Saturday Evening Post. With about 200 million copies sold in thirty languages, popular radio serials and the long running TV Series beginning in 1957, Perry Mason is one of the most popular mystery series of all time.  Gardner was made a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America in 1962.<br />Gardner followed a simple, but surefire formula.  Perry's clients, mostly women, were wrongly accused, but DA Hamilton Berger was out to get them.  Perry, along with his loyal secretary Della Street and private Detective Paul Drake, was forced to cut corners to solve the cases before his clients could have a murder rap pinned on them.  Despite his willingness to play fast and loose, Perry is essentially honest, as he tells Della in the Baited Hook:<br />  Lots of lawyers go into court with a case founded on false testimony.  Sometimes they make it  stick.  Sometimes they don't.  Personally, I've never dared to take the risk.  Truth is the most  powerful weapon a man can use, and if you practice law the way we do, it's the only weapon  powerful enough to use.<br />If you've never read on of the Perry Masons they are well worth your time.  You can always find old copies of them at local book sales and it appears that many of them are still in print.<br />GRADE: B+	2000-10-13

The characters seem to be searching for moral guidance and inner peace. They approach the world prepared for the miraculous to occur and, open to the possibility, they tend to perceive such miracles in the circumstances of every day life.<br />The central character in this story is Kenzie Maxwell, who like Buechner is an author in later life.  Twenty years earlier, at a time when he sensed an emptiness in his life, he began attending church and volunteering in the community.  While working in a shelter for runaways (on whose Board his attorney brother served), Kenzie fell in love with a graffiti-tagging teenage girl named Kia.  Unbeknownst to him, Kia died giving birth to their child in her tenement apartment.  But when Kia's grandmother approached the shelter for help with the child, scandal exploded.  Kenzie and his brother Dalton became estranged and Kenzie has spent the intervening years seeking absolution and providing for the care and raising of Bree, his daughter with Kia, who has become a professional dancer.  Now he lives on an island with his wealthy wife Willow and, among other things, continues to attend church, volunteers with the elderly and works on writing a combination journal/apology to Kia.  Therein, he describes his current life:<br />  I will continue to do penance, that's what I will do.  I will continue to live off of my wife's money.  I will continue to attend the eight o'clock service Sundays in my hooded blue sweatshirt and try to  hear the voices of the saints through the Frog Bishop's amiable bromides.  In short, I will go on  playing, as I have for years, the feckless has-been they take me for with my unmentionable past and  queer ways.  That is my sackcloth and ashes.  I will also, of course, continue to bring what succor  I can to the very old because I'm not to be trusted ever, ever again with the very young.  I never  even trusted myself.<br />As the passage demonstrates, he has accepted the harsh societal judgment about his relationship with Kia, even though the book makes it clear that they shared a mutual and nonexploitative love.  Moreover, the daughter that they produced holds a special place in Kenzie's heart.  One night in bed Willow asked him if he believed in miracles:<br />  ...his answer, mumbled drowsily through his mustache, was, 'Bree is a miracle.'<br />  He reached out one arm to turn off the light and then , lying there on his back with his eyes open,  he tried to tell her what he meant.  What he meant was that out of the forlorn and unnecessary  death in the cold-water flat with only the hysterical grandmother in attendance, there had come life.  It was as if Kia had managed to spray up her name in the most impossible of all places and in colors  so fast that, with luck, it would be yeas before the weather or the passage of time effaced it.  Bree  herself was that name, the long-legged girl with her hair in a bun who smoked cigarettes to his  horror and whom he longed above all things to keep safe not only from the weather and the passage  of time but also from anything in herself that might threaten her.  As she leapt off the  practice-room floor in her black leotards or was raised  like the Host at St, Mary's by some boy  with his hands at her waist--as she did her entrechats and plies and pas de chat with a dancer's  imperturbable smile--he thought of her as inscribing the name that she embodied again and again  through the stuffy air until Kia, Kia, was everywhere.  It might so easily have gotten lost in the  shadows, but it hadn't.  That was the miracle, that and the knowledge that he of all people--in his  own eyes so sybaritic and self-centered, so studiously unserious about almost everything the world  took seriously--would at the drop of a hat give whatever was left of his life to save her from harm.  He could tell from the sound of Willow's breathing that she had fallen asleep, but he continued to  think about miracles as he watched the moon rise over the water.<br />The plot of the book centers around the gathering of Kenzie's pretty non-nuclear family on the island for his 70th birthday.  Even his estranged brother arrives, having been invited down by the bitter old woman who owns and developed the island and resents Kenzie for the whiff of scandal he carries.  Each of the characters has his or her own burdens to bear, although each seems to also be a fundamentally good person whose worst critic is him or her self.  As they all come together a huge sudden and viscious storm blows up (the whole novel is loosely based on Shakespeare's The Tempest) and leaves in its wake a group of people who are much changed from when first we met them.<br />In a world where so many people care so little about morality in general and the quality of their own actions in specific, the denizens of Buechner's world are heartsick at the thought that their behavior does not measure up to the standards they believe in.  At times we long for them to ease up on themselves a little, but at the same time, it may be precisely this type of self-judgment and regulation that makes them such essentially decent people.<br />Their decency, their idiosyncrasies and the beauty of Buechner's storytelling make this a delightful novel.<br />Grade: Ad at the drop of a hat give whatever was left of his life to save her from harm.

In fact, I got so bad around 5th grade that, having torn through the stories and poems, I was even reading biographies about him.  But somehow, even with all of that, I think I had missed this longer work.  I'm sorry I did, because while this wildly overstuffed adventure is enjoyable now, I would have really loved it as a kid.<br />When Arthur Gordon Pym stows away on a whaling ship, he little dreams that he'll encounter tyranny, mutiny, biblical storms, cannibalism, shipwreck...and Poe's just getting warmed up.<br />I've read that he cobbled together this semi-novel from several shorter pieces he'd written.  It has a somewhat uneven feel to it; episodic, even disjointed.  And as the episodes are piled one on top of the other it becomes a tad much.  But it is always fun, often thrilling, and the mayhem that lurks on the surface guards layer upon layer of allegory and allusion.  As you read you find yourself saying, &quot;Hey, Melville borrowed that scene and Jack London got that idea here and Lovecraft cadged this plot...&quot;  If you have any doubts about how influential a literary figure Edgar Allan Poe was, this melodramatic masterpiece will put them to rest.  More importantly, you'll thoroughly enjoy yourself.<br />GRADE: A-	2000-10-13

The events of the book, meager as they are, take place on Easter Week in 1983. Frank visits an ex-athlete for a story, visits his girlfriend's family &amp; deals with a distraught fellow member of the local Divorced Men's Club. Along the way he gives a running (and running and running) narrative about his envy of athletes' ability to stay &quot;within themselves&quot; &amp; compares it to his own sense of &quot;dreaminess&quot; or alienation from himself and his life.<br />Bascombe is a prime example of what C.S. Lewis called &quot;Men without Chests&quot;.  He is a hollow man, empty at the core of his being. He has no friends. He does not believe anything or in anything. And he is in a state of flight from the responsibilities (to wife, children &amp; career) that provide the only anchors in his life. He represents everything that is wrong with the self-centered, irresponsible, unbelieving men of his generation. He is a man in need of a good bitchslap and in fact, the highlight of the book comes when his girlfriend cold cocks him.<br />Ford is such a good writer that even though Frank is excruciatingly annoying and his narrative goes on much too long, we can't help getting caught up in the story. But the book is ultimately unsatisfying because Ford himself does not take an editorial stand in regard to Frank. Is the book meant to be a satirical look at Frank? Or is Frank speaking in Ford's own voice &amp; telling us how Ford feels about modern life?<br />In the  epilogue we find out that Frank has basically quit his job, moved to Florida &amp; is involved in a relationship with a 21 year old college student. How can this further retreat from responsibility be seen as redeeming him?<br />I finished the book feeling that Ford had brilliantly laid bare the pathology of a certain type of modern male, but since I fail to see any change for the better in Frank, it seems a purely cautionary tale.<br />GRADE: Cof a certain type of modern male, but since I fail to see any change for the better in Frank, it seems a purely cautionary tale. <br />GRADE: C	2000-10-13

Wade is now in his forties, lives in the Mountains of Central New Hampshire and works as a well driller, snow plower and town constable.  His high school sweetheart wife has left him and taken their daughter.  Now Wade is reduced to living alone in a wind swept trailer and drinking way too much.  Over the course of the novel, this is apparently a common theme for Banks, he realizes how desolate and desperate his life has become and he begins to lash out at his abusive father, shrewish ex-wife, his tyrannical boss and the towns uppity part time residents, the idle rich in their ski chalets.  In particular, he becomes obsessed with regaining custody of his daughter and with proving that a seeming hunting accident was actually murder.<br />These twin compulsions turn out to be a lever with which Wade can pry open his hemmed in life and assert power for once.  But the exercise of power and the awakening of self carry dangers which Wade is ill equipped to confront and tragedy lurks around the corner.<br />I liked this book much better than I expected to; the movie ads seem to promise merely another domestic abuse fiesta, but that story line is really somewhat peripheral.  Wade's struggle to gain some control over his life is nearly heroic and we root for him top succeed.  But Banks piles on such melodramatics that we anticipate that he is doomed.<br />There's also another weakness, and a more significant one.  The story is narrated by Wade's brother in such an omniscient manner that it becomes distracting.  You continually find yourself saying, how does he know that fact or know how that person felt.  Also, the tone of his narration is so portentous that we know early on that Wade is headed for disaster; too early.<br />In the end, I recommend the book, but less whole heartedly than Ernest Hebert's similar cycle of New Hampshire novels.<br />GRADE: B-shire novels. <br />GRADE: B-	2000-10-13

I read this book when we first moved up here, because the young author was a recent Dartmouth grad and there were stories about him all over the place.  Supposedly he had asked his parents for $10,000 and a year of room and board so that he could write the book.  Then, upon completion, the movie rights alone sold for millions.  I can't vouch for all of that.<br />On first reading, I just thought that Smith had taken a decent thriller and lost control of it about three quarters of the way through.  On a snowy New Year's Eve, two brothers &amp; a friend find a plane wreck on a farm in Northern Ohio.  Inside the plane they find a raven pecked corpse and a duffel bag containing $4.4 million.  Hank Mitchell is married (to Sarah) with a child on the way and has a job as an accountant at a local feed store; he wants to notify the authorities.  But his brother Jacob and Jacob's friend, Lou, are ne'er do wells who want to keep the money.  Hank finally agrees but only on the condition that he hold the money, they not tell anyone about the plane, they not divvy the loot up until summer and then only if the coast looks clear and he will burn it if there is any sign of trouble.  Predictably, complications arise.<br />Surprisingly, noone comes to claim the money and noone finds the plane.  But Jacob and Lou prove increasing unreliable--drinking, gambling and gabbing....<br />All of that just seemed a little much the first time around and I still think that Smith loses his grip on the reader in the final quarter of the book.  But on second reading, more prepared for the excesses of the plot and willing to grant them a sort of internal logic, the themes of the story emerged for me and I really liked them.  At it's core, this is a Puritan fable as filtered through the uniquely American lens of noir fiction; the fundamental lesson, that easy money is corrupting:<br />  Lou: All this money staring you right in the face.  It's the American dream, and you just want to  walk away from it.<br />  Hank: You work for the American dream, Lou.  You don't steal it.<br />Hank ignores this lesson at his own peril and like Cain (he even gets wounded on the forehead) ...but in the end he tells us:<br />  I feel--despite everything I've done that might make it seem otherwise--human, exactly like everyone  else.<br />Of course, he is eminently human, but he stands as a nearly biblical example of what happens when man places himself beyond moral constraints.<br />The book is flawed.  Smith, a first time author, was badly served, as are most writers today, by his editor.  But it's, at least, a fun read and maybe an interesting one.

His cheeks were as  chubby as a baby's, his skin ivory-tinted, his black hair close-cropped, his amber eyes slanting.  -The House Without a Key<br />So enters Charlie Chan, crack detective of the Honolulu Police Force, in this his first appearance in print.  While vacationing in Hawaii in 1919, Earl Derr Biggers read about a local Chinese detective named Chang Apana.  Intrigued by the concept, he created Charlie Chan, one of the great fictional detectives in all of literature, and, thanks to the movies, one of the enduring cultural icons of the century.  He is, of course, a stereotype, but it's hard to see how he would be objectionable.  After all, he's a bright, witty, polite police officer and family man.  If anything, I should be offended, the WASP descendants of the Hawaiian missionaries are caricatured as priggish and sanctimonious, but I got over it.  It's all done in a spirit of fun and who's to say that the caricatures don't have something to them.<br />The real charm of the book lies in the portrayal of a Hawaii that is now long gone.  The islands we see here were still pre-statehood, dominated by the Anglo aristocracy, but with a large and vital Asian community.

In The Beekeeper's Apprentice she brings a feminist touch to the Sherlock Holmes mythos.  The 19th century bequeathed us four iconic literary creations: Frankenstein, Dracula, Moby Dick/Ahab &amp; Sherlock Holmes.  We see them revived over and over, most often with some cute modern twist (my personal favorite Holmes revivals: the Nicholas Meyer novel The Seven Percent Solution, wherein Sigmund Freud helps him with his cocaine addiction; the film They Might Be Giants, with George C. Scott as an insane? Holmes wannabe &amp; Joanne Woodward as his psychiatrist/reluctant Watson; and the Magnum, PI episode with Higgins playing Watson to Patrick McNee's Holmes), but the characters are so strong that they survive most any mutilation and so this new treatment seems semi inevitable.<br />King has picked up the tale in 1915, with Holmes retired to his beehives in the Sussex countryside.  Into his life of seclusion stumbles a precocious teenage orphan girl named Mary Russell, who quickly proves to have a mind that is a ready match for Holmes.  They begin to solve crimes together and eventually, by this time Mary is attending Oxford, they run afoul of an archvillian who is intent on bringing about Holmes' demise.  Of course, this master criminal is also a woman.<br />King has picked up a double edged sword here; the mere presence of Sherlock Holmes (&amp; Watson &amp; Mrs. Hudson &amp; Mycroft &amp; Lestrade) virtually guarantees a decent tale (unless the author's a total butcher), but by choosing a figure who comes to us with such a weighty reputation &amp; then trying to craft her own characters to set up as his equals, she has bitten off more than she can chew.  Unable to bring Mary up to the level of the Holmes of the Conan Doyle series, she instead brings him down to the level of her own character Mary Russell.  The result is a middling mystery, but one ends the book more than willing to read the future entries in the series.Mary Russell.

Dennis Barlow is a young British poet, who, having lost his movie job, is temporarily employed at The Happier Hunting Ground, a pet cemetery modeled after the hallowed Whispering Glades, graveyard to the stars.  But such a lowly job is anathema to the British expatriate community, as Sir Ambrose Abercrombie informs him:<br />  We limeys have a peculiar position to keep up, you know, Barlow.  They may laugh at us a bit--the  way we talk and the way we dress; our monocles--they may think us cliquey and stand-offish. but,  by God, they respect us.  Your five-to-two is a judge of quality.  He knows what he's buying and  it's only the finest type of Englishman that you meet out here.  I often feel like an ambassador,  Barlow.  It's a responsibility, I can tell you, and in various degrees every Englishman out here  shares it.  We can't all be at the top of the tree but we are all men of responsibility.  You never find  an Englishman among the under-dogs--except in England, of course.  That's understood out here,  thanks to the example we've set.  There are jobs that an Englishman just doesn't take.<br />However, when Barlow's roommate, Sir Francis Hinsley, is abruptly dismissed from his studio job and hangs himself, Abercrombie and his fellow Cricket Club members depend on Barlow to arrange the burial--after all, he knows about how to dispose of animal remains, how much different can it be?<br />So Barlow heads over to Whispering Glades where he is treated to a hilariously garish tour and sales pitch.  He meets and falls in love with one of the cosmeticians there, Aim&eacute;e Thanatogenos, but must hide the truth about his embarrassing job, particularly since she is also smitten with Mr. Joyboy, the legendary embalmer at Whispering Glades.  When she proves unresponsive to his own poetry, Barlow woos her with passages from the great poets, the works of whom she is utterly ignorant.<br />Naturally, it all goes bung, as Barlow's various frauds are revealed and Aim&eacute;e kills herself.  Barlow extorts some money out of the scandal fearing Joyboy and buries her at the Hunting Grounds, so:<br />  Tomorrow and on every anniversary as long as the Happier Hunting Ground existed a postcard  would go to Mr. Joyboy:  Your little Aim&eacute;e is wagging her tail in heaven tonight, thinking of you.<br />Waugh lays bare a Hollywood where all is pretense and illusion, where human lives--never mind human feelings--are meaningless, where semantic niceties, like calling a corpse a &quot;Loved One&quot; are intended to mask reality.  It is brutal, and unfortunately still timely, and quite certainly one of the best novels ever written about the movie industry.

Milne (The Red House Mystery)<br />A.A. Milne is, of course, best remembered for his series of Winnie the Pooh tales.  In addition, he wrote for the famous British humor magazine Punch, was a fine playwright and, though he served in WWI, became an outspoken pacifist.  In the midst of all this, he wrote one of the classic English drawing room mysteries--The Red House Mystery.  The book ends on a note which seems to imply that further adventures will follow, but sadly none did.<br />The Red House is a British manor, home to Mark Ablett, and gathering place for his fun loving friends.  But the bucolic setting is disrupted when Ablett's long lost brother, black sheep of the family, is murdered and Mark goes missing.  Two guests, Antony Gillingham, a sort of Holmsian jack of all trades, and Bill Beverley, a mildly dense Watson-like sidekick, take it upon themselves to solve the crime.  What follows is a reasonably dated but still amusing &quot;intuitive&quot; mystery.  Raymond Chandler apparently went out of his way to attack the story as one of the worst examples of the genre, wholly lacking in genuine criminological methodology and requiring enormous intuitive leaps on the part of the &quot;detectives&quot;.  Still, take it for what it is and it offers a pleasant enough reading experience.<br />GRADE: C+	2000-10-13

The year I was 12, the movie was a remake of Lost Horizon--my most graphic memory from that night is my horror when the woman suddenly aged after leaving Shangri-La.  As it turns out, that version of the movie is pretty dreadful, while Frank Capra's 1937 original is widely considered to be a classic.  At any rate, I liked the film enough to read the book and also Hilton's other classic, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and I loved them both.  Recently, our library got a restored edition of the Capra film and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  So I went back &amp; reread the books.<br />I assume most folks know at least the rough outlines of the stories.  In Lost Horizon, Hugh Conway, a British diplomat, is skyjacked and he &amp; his traveling companions end up in the Himalayas.  Eventually they are lead to the hidden Valley of the Blue Moon and the city of Shangri-La, where folks do not age and the powers that be are collecting all of the world's knowledge and greatest artworks, so that it will be safe from the turbulent political storms of the outside world.  Eventually, the high lama reveals to the diplomat that he has been chosen to take over leadership of Shangri-La and after an abortive attempt to leave (at the insistence of one of his fellow travelers), Conway returns to assume his destined place in Shangri-La.<br />Good-bye, Mr. Chips, on the other hand, is about an eccentric but lovable British schoolmaster, Arthur Chipping (Mr. Chips).  Seemingly destined to be a bachelor for life, he meets and marries a young woman who loosens him up quite a bit, before dying in childbirth.  Chips is left alone, except that is for the succeeding generations of boys who pass through Brookfield School.  After decades at the school, he retires, telling the assembled alumni, &quot;I have thousands of faces in my mind. ... I remember you as you are.  That's the point.  In my mind you never grow old at all&quot;, only to be called back during WWI, at which point he becomes acting headmaster.  One of his duties is to read the list of the school's war dead; for everyone else they are just names, but for Chips, each name has a face attached.  After the War he reretires, after 42 years teaching Roman History and Latin at Brookfield.<br />On the surface, these two stories couldn't be more different, but reading them now I realize how similar they actually are.  Shangri-La is an oasis of civilzation in a world that was after all between two World Wars.  It is a place where the great achievements of our culture will be preserved, even if war consumes the rest of the World, which for much of this Century seemed like a possibility.  Mr. Chips, meanwhile, is the living embodiment of institutional memory.  The classes of boys, the teachers and headmasters, even the subjects and teaching methods, come and go, but Chips has remained throughout.  He &quot;still had those ideas of dignity and generosity that a frantic world was forgetting.&quot;  He embodies the pre-War world and its values.  In his book Mr. Bligh's Bad Language, Greg Dening says that: &quot;Institutions require memory.  A memory creates precedent and order.&quot;  In the very midst of an epoch that was witnessing an unfettered attack on all of the West's institutions and values, Hilton created Shangri-La and Mr. Chips; both represent the conservative ideal--providing a bridge of memory to all that is beautiful and good and decent in our past, lest, in our zeal to create a perfect world, we forget the qualities and accomplishments which bequeathed us the pretty good world in which we live.<br />These books are unabashedly sentimental and I'm sure some would even find them mawkish.  But I love them and I appreciate the subtley non-political way in which they make the most important of political points: even as we move forward we must always preserve those things and ideas of value in our past.<br />Mr. Chips  GRADE: A+<br />Lost Horizon  GRADE: Ae in our past. <br />Mr. Chips  GRADE: A+ <br />Lost Horizon  GRADE: A	2000-10-13

Nina's fiance, Howard Plummer, was killed in  what appears to have been a simple mugging, but then Nina found ten thousand  dollars hidden in her apartment. Since Howard worked for Charles McKewn  Armister IV, helping to manage his $60 million, Nina fears he may have been  skimming money.<br />McGee starts looking around &amp; becomes suspicious when he finds out that Armister  had a nervous breakdown recently &amp; has undergone drastic personality changes  since then.

The options range from the isolationism of Pat Buchanan to the interventionist nation-building of Bill Clinton.  Anyone wishing to understand the ongoing arguments should read this terrific book.  McDougall's compelling thesis is that there is a fundamental dichotomy in US Foreign Policy, with two competing doctrines each influenced by four different themes.  There is the Promised Land (or Old Testament) impulse, which is based on four key traditions:<br />  OLD TESTAMENT (Promised Land)  Exceptionalism (focus on liberty at home, avoiding entangling alliances)  Unilateralism (as opposed to isolationism)  The American System (Monroe Doctrine)  Expansionism (Manifest Destiny)<br />This was the prevailing approach to foreign policy--designed to protect America's liberty and independence from the outside world--until 1898 and the Spanish American War, at which point a New Testament gained ascendancy, likewise guided by four traditions:<br />  NEW TESTAMENT (Crusader State)  Progressive Imperialism  Liberal Internationalism (Wilsonianism)  Containment  Global Meliorism (reforming other nations internal problems)<br />The adoption of the New Testament policy marked the triumph of the &quot;do-gooder impulse&quot; and represented America's desire to influence the rest of the world and try to make it a &quot;better&quot; place.  Given this context, we can see that Buchanan and Clinton are representatives of two great historic trends in American thought; what remains is for us to decide between the two.<br />After presenting the historic development of each of the eight traditions, McDougall concludes with a chapter on whether each would serve us well now.  The only New Testament tradition that he sees any value in is Containment.  In fact, he treats Containment well throughout the book.  It seems as if he's a little overawed by George Kennan (the father of Containment).  In particular, he gives the policy credit for defeating the Soviet Union.  While he does criticize the price paid (huge debt, internal dissent, etc.), I believe that he overestimates the policy.  First of all, if containment did work, it too 36 years to do so and that is simply too long.  Second, it would seem that you have to consider the Reagan Era policy to be quite different than what had come before, especially the active support of counterrevolutionary movements in Soviet Bloc countries (Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Angola). Generally, the discussion of how US policy won the Cold War is somewhat weak.<br />But his final conclusions, that we should return to the Old Testament--taking care of our own internal problems; being prepared to act unilaterally, if at all; remaining strong enough to deter challenges; and thereby, continuing to fulfill our unique destiny--is cogent and extremely powerful.  This is a pivotal text for understanding our role in the world, past, present and future.<br />GRADE: Ar on whether each would serve us well now.

John Harvey is apparently retiring Charlie Resnick, Archer Mayor may do the same with Joe Gunther and Colin Dexter killed off Inspector Morse.  This leaves something of a void in the genre, particularly at the more noirish margin, but luckily, Ian Rankin and Detective John Rebus seem to be just hitting their stride and, with the ranks of the competitors thinned, these tartan noir novels will hopefully gain the audience they richly deserve.<br />Rankin began the series in 1987 with Knots and Crosses.  His creation, John Rebus, a former SAS special op turned Scottish police detective, is driven by Calvinist guilt, fueled by whiskey, cigarettes and pop music and is willing, even eager, to cut corners and push boundaries in his pursuit of a pretty harsh justice.  But now, eight books and ten years into the series, Rebus is reaching a crisis point as an overwhelming confluence of events threatens to swamp him.  First, he's been transferred to a backwater division in the wake of the fallout from his last case and his first investigation there seems to tie into both the North Sea oil industry and the mobs.  Second, an old case where he and his mentor played fast and loose with the rules has been reopened.  Third, a copycat killer has started imitating the murder pattern of Bible John (a true life killer) who terrified Scotland in the late 60's.  The new killer has been nicknamed Johnny Bible and Rebus is obsessed by both killers.  Finally, one of his old partners is assigned to keep an eye on him and starts talking to him about the changes that AA has made in his life and pushing Rebus to reexamine his own.<br />Rankin somehow manages to keep all these plates spinning in a really superior entry in one of the more underrated series around.

Manias and fads, by definition, lead folks to engage in behavior that looks nearly insane to the impartial observer.  Meanwhile, America, for myriad reasons, has always provided fertile ground for self-improvement crazes.  Perhaps the simple fact that democracy and capitalism offer people so much freedom to define themselves and opportunity to mold their own destinies just inevitably carries with it a darker flip-side in this heightened susceptibility to irrational and dubious schemes.  Whatever the cause, T. Corraghessan Boyle takes glorious advantage of this national tendency in The Road to Wellville and renders a brutally funny portrait of the health food quacks and con artists of Battle Creek, Michigan.<br />Is there a kid with soul so dead that his heart doesn't start pumping a little bit faster when he hears that magical name?: Battle Creek, Michigan.  I know when I was a kid, I so loved breakfast cereal that I ate it, to my Grandmother's abiding horror, out of a dog bowl, so that I could get a sufficiently Brobdignagian portion.  And it can't be true, but in memories of childhood it certainly seems like every single on of those cereals was made in Battle Creek and somewhere they must have had a huge repository of knick knacks, gew gaws and various other cheesy toys, because that's always where you had to send away for them.<br />Well, unbeknownst to those of us who hoovered down Lucky Charms and Cap'n Crunch and Sugar Smacks and the like, the original breakfast cereals were the product of men like C.W. Post and Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and they were part of a health fad.  Apparently they weren't originally intended to deliver massive amounts of sugar and cheap toys to growing boys.  Nor were men like Kellogg simply concerned with getting some grains into people's diets.  In fact, he ran an enormous luxurious Sanitarium where wealthy patrons would come to cleanse themselves via meat-free diets, enemas five times a day and a whole battery of other wacky treatments and inspirational harangues from Kellogg.<br />Boyle takes this potent comic setting, made up of equal parts holiness and hucksterism, and sets up several storylines which all converge at the San.  There's a confrontation between Kellogg and a wayward adopted son, the only one of his 40+ adoptees to rebel against Kellogg's bizarre health regimen.  There's an increasingly troubled young married couple, Will and Eleanor Lightbody, troubled because she has bought into Kellogg's theories with gusto, while he loathes the regimentation and tasteless diet.  Then there's Charlie Ossining, a young man on the make who just wants a piece of the cereal business and his own share of the American Dream.<br />Boyle gets in his fair share of gratuitous shots and slapstick gags, but there's a broader point that gets driven home along the way.  For all of these characters utter self-absorption and the folly of their attempt to sort of re-engineer themselves, in the end they can not escape their essential humanness, their mortality, their physical and mental vulnerability and the ultimate spiritual emptiness of Kellogg's slogans.  In the final scenes of the novel each character is reintroduced, abruptly, even violently, to the messy reality of the outside world.  Kellogg's Spa is exposed as a kind of Potemkin Village, presenting a facade of health which masks the deep unhappiness and essentially unhealthy lives of it's residents.<br />It's interesting that Boyle made this a historical rather than a contemporary novel; it sort of has the feel of an E. L. Doctorow to it.  Perhaps he was merely seeking Doctorowesque sales, and, indeed, the book was his most successful and was made into a big budget movie, which is supposedly awful.  But the stories and themes would work just as well if the novel were set in current society.  Dupes are still out therelooking for that quick fix and sharpies are still out there getting rich off of their delusions.

Years ago, her drunken loutish husband was gunned down by the  Guarda after hiding IRA arms on the property. Now, McGreevy, an IRA gunman on  the run, has chosen her house as a hiding place. The two start as bitter  enemies, but gradually develop a tentative understanding, as they come to  understand the losses that the other has suffered. But all ends in tragedy, as  the Guarda returns to the House.<br />O'Brien writes in luxuriant prose, but it's that kind of writing where you think  there are sentences or words missing. She seems to assume that you understand  more than you do.<br />But the bigger flaw in the book, is her misunderstanding (shared by many) of the  Irish troubles in their modern form. She sees them as something intrinsic to  Ireland and the Irish, a bitter violent history seeping from the soil. In fact,  the really violent period of Irish history was an outgrowth of the Cold War.  The struggle had long ceased to be about Ireland &amp; unity &amp; had devolved into a  simple matter of radical Left opposition to the British. As a result, the  collapse of the Soviet Union has taken the IRA with it &amp; brought an end to the  &quot;troubles&quot;.<br />That said, her unique prose style &amp; her obvious empathy for her characters, make  this one a marginally worthwhile read.<br />GRADE: C	2000-10-13

A good man, ambitious. But so busy helping  others, life seems to pass him by. Despondent. He wishes he had never been born. He gets his wish.  Through the eyes of a guardian angel he sees the world as it would have been had he not been born.  Wow! What an idea.  The kind of idea that when I get old and sick and scared and ready to die --  they'll say, 'He made The Greatest Gift.'  -Frank Capra<br />I'm sure your family does it too, sit around watching It's a Wonderful Life and speaking all of the lines moments ahead of the characters.  Younger folk may not recall that in the early 80's, before Republic Pictures reclaimed the copyright to the movie, it was on literally dozens of times from Thanksgiving to New Years every year.  And we all watched it, every single showing.  Somehow the upbeat message about the individual's capacity to change the world for the better achieved a special resonance in those heady Reagan Era days of promise.  Now it's shown on a network just once a season as an attempt at Event programming, but every red blooded American family owns a videotape and pops it in at least a few times over the holidays.<br />Turns out, the movie was based on a story by respected Civil War historian, Philip Van Doren Stern (one assumes he's from The Van Doren family of Quiz Show fame).  The story sprang full blown from Van Doren's head while he was shaving on the morning of  Feb. 12, 1938.  He rewrote it several times and then in 1943 sent it to his agent to see if he could get a magazine to buy it.  Unbelievably, they all turned it down.  So he had a couple hundred copies made and sent them to friends in their Christmas cards.  Someone showed the story to Frank Capra when he was looking for a project after the War ended and, if the quote above is to be believed, he instantly realized that he had an American classic in his hands.<br />The story itself is much more spare than the movie.  Characters like Uncle Billy, Violet Bick, Ernie and Bert and even Mr. Potter are all missing.  But the essential tale, of George Pratt contemplating suicide and a guardian angel intervening to show him the effect he has had on the lives of others, remains.

The year I was 12, the movie was a remake of Lost Horizon--my most graphic memory from that night is my horror when the woman suddenly aged after leaving Shangri-La.  As it turns out, that version of the movie is pretty dreadful, while Frank Capra's 1937 original is widely considered to be a classic.  At any rate, I liked the film enough to read the book and also Hilton's other classic, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and I loved them both.  Recently, our library got a restored edition of the Capra film and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  So I went back &amp; reread the books.<br />I assume most folks know at least the rough outlines of the stories.  In Lost Horizon, Hugh Conway, a British diplomat, is skyjacked and he &amp; his traveling companions end up in the Himalayas.  Eventually they are lead to the hidden Valley of the Blue Moon and the city of Shangri-La, where folks do not age and the powers that be are collecting all of the world's knowledge and greatest artworks, so that it will be safe from the turbulent political storms of the outside world.  Eventually, the high lama reveals to the diplomat that he has been chosen to take over leadership of Shangri-La and after an abortive attempt to leave (at the insistence of one of his fellow travelers), Conway returns to assume his destined place in Shangri-La.<br />Good-bye, Mr. Chips, on the other hand, is about an eccentric but lovable British schoolmaster, Arthur Chipping (Mr. Chips).  Seemingly destined to be a bachelor for life, he meets and marries a young woman who loosens him up quite a bit, before dying in childbirth.  Chips is left alone, except that is for the succeeding generations of boys who pass through Brookfield School.  After decades at the school, he retires, telling the assembled alumni, &quot;I have thousands of faces in my mind. ... I remember you as you are.  That's the point.  In my mind you never grow old at all&quot;, only to be called back during WWI, at which point he becomes acting headmaster.  One of his duties is to read the list of the school's war dead; for everyone else they are just names, but for Chips, each name has a face attached.  After the War he reretires, after 42 years teaching Roman History and Latin at Brookfield.<br />On the surface, these two stories couldn't be more different, but reading them now I realize how similar they actually are.  Shangri-La is an oasis of civilzation in a world that was after all between two World Wars.  It is a place where the great achievements of our culture will be preserved, even if war consumes the rest of the World, which for much of this Century seemed like a possibility.  Mr. Chips, meanwhile, is the living embodiment of institutional memory.  The classes of boys, the teachers and headmasters, even the subjects and teaching methods, come and go, but Chips has remained throughout.  He &quot;still had those ideas of dignity and generosity that a frantic world was forgetting.&quot;  He embodies the pre-War world and its values.  In his book Mr. Bligh's Bad Language, Greg Dening says that: &quot;Institutions require memory.  A memory creates precedent and order.&quot;  In the very midst of an epoch that was witnessing an unfettered attack on all of the West's institutions and values, Hilton created Shangri-La and Mr. Chips; both represent the conservative ideal--providing a bridge of memory to all that is beautiful and good and decent in our past, lest, in our zeal to create a perfect world, we forget the qualities and accomplishments which bequeathed us the pretty good world in which we live.<br />These books are unabashedly sentimental and I'm sure some would even find them mawkish.  But I love them and I appreciate the subtley non-political way in which they make the most important of political points: even as we move forward we must always preserve those things and ideas of value in our past.<br />Mr. Chips  GRADE: A+<br />Lost Horizon  GRADE: Ae in our past. <br />Mr. Chips  GRADE: A+ <br />Lost Horizon  GRADE: A	2000-10-13

Earl Janoth, his tyrannical boss, refuses to give him a raise, so George seduces Janoth's icy blonde mistress, Pauline Delos: &quot;The eye saw nothing but innocence, to the instincts she was undiluted sex, the brain said here was a perfect hell.&quot;  After several months, he asks her for another date &amp; takes her to Gil's tavern, where Gil has his own museum behind the bar, with anything you can ask him for &amp; a personal story about it,or the drinks are free.  Later, they stop in an antique store &amp; George outwits an old woman and the dealer &amp; the dealer &amp; snags a Louise Patterson for just $50.  He drops her off at her apartment, just as Janoth is getting there, but Janoth can't really see who he is as he's shrouded in shadow.  Janoth &amp; Pauline go upstairs &amp; get into an argument.  He calls her to task for her lesbian lovers.  She accuses him of an affair with his malicious henchman, Steve Hagen: &quot;a hard, dark little man whose soul had been hit by lightning, which he'd liked.  His mother was a bank vault, and his father an International Business Machine.&quot;  Janoth clubs her to death and races to Hagen to bail him out of the mess.<br />Hagen determines that they'll have Crimeways begin an investigation and try to pin the murder on the man that Janoth saw in the shadows, so they put it in George's hands.  But all of the evidence seems to point towards George himself, so he starts trying to block the investigation.  He, of course, knows that he's not guilty, but the &quot;Big Clock&quot; of life is grinding on and George is in deep trouble: &quot;Sometimes the hands of the clock actually raced, and at other times they hardly moved at all.

In New York City in the year 2009, 150 dogs arrive, walking upright, speaking English and clad in 19th century Prussian formal wear.

In 1882 he was forced to flee to Canada, where he and his successors perfected their creations.  But ultimately the dogs rebelled and now they are ready to enter the world.<br />Ms Bakis greatest achievement is to make this whole scenario seem totally plausible and she creates a set of characters who earn our affection and eventually our pity, as the dogs begin to descend into insanity.

This would be a great mistake.

But personally I read it as a tale of Western Christian triumphalism over existentialism.  Beowulf and the other humans, most importantly the Shaper, represent the idea that there is a purpose to life and order in the universe.  Grendel, influenced by the dragon, believes that existence is its own end, that life is meaningless.  But even Grendel is plagued by the realization that his world view is empty and unfulfilling, so when he hears the Shaper's song:<br />  He told of an ancient feud between two brothers which split the world between darkness and light.  And I, Grendel, was the dark side, he said in effect. The terrible race God cursed. I believed him.  Such was the power of the Shaper's harp!<br />The Shaper's implicit message--that human existence serves a purpose and that man, through the cultivation of art, science and religion, is realizing a destiny--is more than Grendel can take:<br />  Thus I fled, ridiculous hairy creature torn apart by poetry... I gnashed my teeth and clutched the  sides of my head as if to heal the split, but I couldn't.<br />Unable to reconcile the beauty of the Shaper's vision and his own dark urge to deny existence any meaning, Grendel tries to destroy the humans.  But, of course, the humans in following the vision have developed the capacity to withstand his primal fury and Beowulf dispatches him--thus ever the confrontations between light and dark.  To this extent, except for giving the beast credit for a pretty well developed philosophical sense, the story is relatively traditional and follows the original.  Moreover, it confirms our understanding of human history, that great societies developed following the adoption of structured belief systems, and that they overwhelmed those necessarily primitive groups which failed to comprehend a general purpose to their own existence.<br />The great innovation here, and the malignancy within the novel, lies in its narrative form.  Gardner, by allowing the monster to narrate the story, implies that there are two equally valid sides to the story.  This device has, not surprisingly, become quite common, particularly as a way to let female and minority characters give their own angles on great literature or history.  Typically it is used to demonstrate that the generally white, male, and Christian authors of the classics have presented only a partial, perhaps propagandistic, and possibly simply dishonest, version of events that actually happened quite differently.  This trend is part of the broader modern tendency toward moral relativism, political correctness, and denial of absolute standards of morality, truth, and beauty.  In this instance, Gardner came down on the right side of the cultural divide, and merely used the device to flesh out the monster.  But as a general proposition, the idea that the Western Canon presents only a partisan view of the world, one that we need not assume is valid, is truly destructive of our shared cultural inheritance and is to be abhorred.  Stories do indeed have two sides; but at the point where we surrender our capacity to say that one side is right and one is simply wrong, we will have wrought catastrophic damage upon our own culture..<br />That said, the book, though far inferior to the original, is still entertaining.<br />GRADE: Beneral purpose to their own existence. <br />The great innovation here, and the malignancy within the novel, lies in its narrative form.

But what is really distinctive is the spiritual territory that he has carved out with these stories of decent men trying to be true to Catholic beliefs in the face of difficult circumstances.  The men at the center of the stories are entrepreneurs, as opposed to professionals or workmen.  They are brawny brawling types, fond of beer and cigarettes and women, love their wives (even ex-wives) and children deeply and they are immersed in the rituals of Catholicism.  Here is the father of A Father's Story:<br />  I go to bed early and sleep well and wake at four forty-five, for an hour of silence.  I never want to  get out of bed then, and every morning I know I can sleep for another four hours, and still not fail  at any of my duties.  But I get up, so have come to believe my life can be seen in miniature in that  struggle in the dark of morning.  While making the bed and boiling water for coffee, I talk to God:  I offer Him my day, every act of my body and spirit, my thoughts and moods, as a prayer of  thanksgiving, and for Gloria and my children and my friends and two women I made love with after  Gloria left.  This morning offertory is a habit from my boyhood in a Catholic school; or then it was  a habit, but as I kept it and grew older it became a ritual.

His antihero Hannibal the Cannibal exploded into the public consciousness after Jonathan Demme's excellent movie version of Silence of the Lambs (1991) came out, with Anthony Hopkins brilliant creepy performance as Lecter.  And, of course, fans and Hollywood have had an anxious 11 year wait for Harris to finally publish a sequel.  But many people may not realize that Hannibal Lecter first appeared, albeit in a cameo role, in the novel Red Dragon and in Michael Mann's capable movie version, Manhunter (1986).  If you've missed this book, I urge you to try it; in many ways it is Harris's best work.<br />FBI Special Will Graham has retired to Sugar Loaf Key, FL with his new wife Molly and her son Willie.  Retired because of his nearly fatal encounter with a linoleum knife wielding Hannibal Lecter, whose capture he was responsible for, and because of the emotional troubles that have accompanied his ability to develop an almost extrasensory empathy for such killers, such that he has trouble purging their feelings from his own psyche.  His peaceful idyll is disrupted when his old boss, Jack Crawford, shows up and asks for his help in catching The Tooth Fairy, a serial killer who is notorious for the tooth marks he leaves and for dicing his victims with shards of broken mirrors.  Reluctantly agreeing to join the chase, Graham decides, in order to recapture the mindset that has made him so eerily effective in prior cases, to visit Hannibal Lecter in  the Chesapeake State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  There the administrator,  Dr. Frederick Chilton, shares an anecdote about Hannibal that demonstrates just how horrible he is:<br />  &quot;On the afternoon of July 8, 1976, Dr. Lecter complained of chest pain.  His restraints were  removed in the examining room to make it easier to give him an electrocardiogram. One of his  attendants left the room to smoke, and the other turned away for a second. The nurse was very  quick and strong. She managed to save one of her eyes.&quot;<br />  &quot;You may find this curious.&quot;  He took a strip of EKG tape from a drawer and unrolled it on his  desk.  He traced the spiky line with his forefinger. &quot;Here, he's resting on the examining table. Pulse  seventy-two. Here, he grabs the nurse's head and pulls her down to him. Here, he is subdued  by the attendant. He didn't resist, by the way, though the attendant dislocated his shoulder. Do you  notice the strange thing? His pulse never got over eighty-five. Even when he tore out her tongue.<br />  I don't think we're any closer to understanding him than the day he came in.''<br />After tabloid reporter Freddie Lowndes splashes this visit all over the pages of The Tattler, the killer too contacts Lecter who urges him to attack Graham.  Thus begins a suspenseful, violent minuet as Graham develops increasing insight into the killer's methodology and psychoses, the killer plans his next kill (he's on a Lunar schedule) and Hannibal pulls strings from the dark background.  Harris provides fascinating detail on police procedure, he writes savvily about how the FBI uses the media and the inventiveness of the crimes he dreams up is genuinely disturbing.  But the most interesting part of the story is the delicate mental balance that Graham has to maintain in order to think like the killers but still remain sane.  And as Graham penetrates further into the killer's mind, Harris reveals more and more background about the Tooth Fairy, Francis Dolarhyde, who it turns out was a horribly misshapen baby, abandoned by his mother and raised by a demented grandmother, early on manifesting the now classic signs of the serial murder--torturing animals and the like.  This background and Will Graham's troubles dealing with the thought patterns he shares with Dolarhyde raise questions about what separates us from such men and whether there's a formula for creating suchevil beings.  Is it really simply a matter of psychosexual abuse of young boys and, presto chango, you've created a serial killer?<br />In addition to this kind of portrayal of the psychotic as victim, our effort to deal with these creatures has resulted in a sizable batch of thrillers where the serial killer is portrayed as a nearly superhuman genius.  This flows from the same impulse that makes folks so willing to believe that assassinations are conspiracies.  It is extremely hard, as a society, to face the fact that nondescript shlubs like David Berkowitz and Lee Harvey Oswald and Richard Speck and James Earl Ray are really capable of causing so much social disruption.  Their crimes are so monumental that we want the killers to be equal in stature to the crimes.  The sad truth of the matter is that these monsters are, in fact, generally hapless losers.  They are not Lecterlike geniuses.<br />That said, Hannibal is still one of the great fictional creations of recent times, our age's version of Dracula or Frankenstein,  and Harris's imaginative story makes for a great, albeit unsettling, read with more food for thought than most novels of the type.<br />GRADE: Ahether there's a formula for creating such evil beings.

But this terrific novel is every bit as good as those others and may in fact be the best thing she ever wrote.<br />From what I've read, it seems that Ms Jackson's work may well have been an expression of her own psychological problems.  If that's true, this story is even more frightening.  It is about two sisters, the older one meek and shy, the other assertive and nearly demonic, who barricade themselves inside a gutted mansion to escape the local townsfolk who torment them because they suspect that the girls were involved in the mass killing of four family members.<br />The psychological overtones are plentiful and troubling.  There is, first of all, the sense in which it appears that it is only when together that the two sisters form one complete personality.  Second, the crime involved is not merely murder, but murder of the family, that ancient taboo.  Third, the two are completely alienated from the society around them, even ignoring the few friendly neighbors who come by to try and help.  Jackson apparently had a horrendous relationship with her mother and with the people of Bennington, where she lived.  Local legend even had it that The Lottery was based on an incident where local boys threw stones at her.  Finally there is a strong indication that not only are the girls happier in their isolation, they may truly be better off by themselves and they may be more &quot;normal&quot; than the people in town.<br />At any rate, the story is creepy and sly and a great deal of fun.

Armed Vessel Bounty	Books	4	24	31	N	N	wide ranging &amp; entertaining	Social theorists have tried many definitions of human nature: human beings are the animals that  make tools, that laugh, that play. I have another: Human-beings are history-makers. We eternally  make our present by looking backwards. We present ourselves by expressing a significant past.  To know us in our history is to know who we are.  -Greg Dening (Performances)<br />At 4:30 A.M. on April 28, 1789 a series of events began which has ever since held a grip on Western imagination.  Fletcher Christian lead a mutiny against Captain William Bligh aboard HMS Bounty.  The aftermath of this rebellion included: Bligh's remarkable 4,000 mile journey with 18 loyal crewmen in an open launch; the sinking of HMS Pandora, which had been sent out to arrest the mutineers, with a loss of 34 men, including 4 of the Bounty crew; and the establishment of a weird sort of tropical commune on Pitcairn's Island by Christian and eight other men along with the Tahitian women (and a few friends and progeny) who may or may not have been the precipitating cause of the whole fiasco.  Eventually Bligh would return to sea, three of the mutineers would be returned to England and hanged and all but one of the men on Pitcairn's Island would be murdered or die of disease.<br />Now there's obviously enough material there to justify the boatload of Bounty books, plays and movies that have poured forth in a steady stream over the past two centuries, but what Professor Dening has uniquely done is to consider the uses to which the story has been put over those years.  He makes the convincing argument that Captain Bligh, contrary to popular imagery, was not particularly abusive of his men.  Indeed, the title of the book is reflective of Dening's position that Bligh was mostly despised for the harsh language he used in upbraiding men, not for any physical measures nor for the quality of his command in general.  Having made his case, Dening moves on to a consideration of why our historical understanding of Bligh requires that he be seen as an ogre.  If the &quot;reality&quot; is that he was a fairly mild captain for his time, why do we, looking backward, see him as the very embodiment of tyrannical authority?  Why are Christian and his cohorts seen as heroes, virtual freedom fighters?<br />The book is wide ranging, learned, entertaining and thought provoking, but its best feature is the balance that Dening strikes between the effort to present the story of the Bounty as ethnographic history (&quot;an attempt to represent the past  as it was actually experienced&quot;) and the realization that:<br />  a historical fact is not what happened but that small part of what has happened that has been used  by historians to talk about,  History is not the past: it is a consciousness of the past used for present  purposes.<br />Everyone who has ever been subjected to a history course in the modern university is familiar with the obsession with primary sources, the Left dictatorship which controls academia insists that the &quot;truth&quot; is to be found in the pamphlets and diaries and letters of the unimportant and the obscure, rather than in the texts and speeches of the great who shaped our understanding of events.  Dening, on the other hand, understands that there is a fundamental dichotomy between the way participants experienced historical events and their importance to the society as a whole.  In a very real sense, it is simply not important whether Christ was the son of God, whether England ruled the colonies harshly, whether Southerners fought for slavery, whether FDR ended the Depression, whether Nixon subverted the Constitution and Clinton merely lied about sex--what matters is that this is how we perceive these events.  In Denings' felicitous phrase: Illusions make things true; truth does not dispel illusion.<br />GRADE: A-our historical understanding of Bligh requires that he be seen as an ogre.

Here, in a less read work, he takes on the origins of the French Revolution and the peculiar French form of democracy it brought and proves an equally keen observer of his own country and countrymen.<br />De Tocqueville makes several vital points about the French Revolution: first, that it built gradually and, given circumstances in France, was inevitable; second, where the American Revolution had as its lodestar the ideal of freedom, the French Revolution was motivated by a passionate hatred of  inequality; third, the demise of all insitutions other than the monarchy in France made it certain that when Revolution came, it would be violent and unchecked; finally, this combination of factors lead to the bizarre nature of the French Revolution, with no developed institutions to turn to once the King was gone and with no great emphasis placed on freedom, the French people were willing to tolerate the nihilism of the Terror and the authoritarianism of the governments that replaced the monarchy.  He does not make the case, but it lies before us, that the American Revolution was fundamentally a positive action, a demand for greater freedom, but the French Revolution was a negative action, a demand that the few not own more than the many.<br />This book was to be followed by a second volume dealing with the the Revolution itself, but he died before he could continue the work. That is a shame; it would have been interesting to have some more insight from him into the French, it seems unlikely that anyone has ever rendered a better description of his people than the one he offers in his Conclusion:<br />  When I observe France from this angle [their temperament] I find the nation itself far more  remarkable than any of the events in its long history. It hardly seems possible that there can ever  have existed any other people so full of contrasts and so extreme in all their doings, so much guided  by their emotions and so little by fixed principles, always behaving better, or worse, than one  expected of them....Undisciplined by temperament, the Frenchman is always readier to put up with  arbitrary rule, however harsh, of an autocrat than with a free, well-ordered government by his  fellow citizens, however worthy of respect they be.  At one moment he is up in arms against  authority and the next we find him serving the powers that be with a zeal such as the most servile  races never display.<br />In the context of this paragraph, we can begin to understand Vichy France and the bureaucratic tyranny of the modern French nation.

A dedication which is richly deserved,  first, because Grubb's great novel &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1953) is truly one of the most disturbing stories of children confronting evil that has ever been written (there's an equally chilling 1955 movie version, Charles Laughton's only directorial effort); second, because King cadges a key theme &amp; the finale of Grubb's novel.  But unfortunately, in calling to mind such a haunting forbear,  it serves to remind us, once again, of how forgettable King's own work tends to be.<br />This book represents King's entirely straightforward and unoriginal take on the legend of the Werewolf.  It seems as if it was probably intended for a younger readership; in addition to the Grubb reference, the hero is a handicapped boy and the book features illustrations by renowned comic book artist Bernie Wrightson.  In fact, Wrightson's art may be the best thing about the book.<br />The book isn't bad--in fact, it's entirely possible that King is unable to write a truly bad book.  But it is a pretty pedestrian work.  I think teenage boys would enjoy it, but for anyone else it will only fill time, and that briefly.

At the Mountains of Madness is perhaps his finest work and is obviously the forerunner of such subsequent horror staples as The Thing and Alien.  It tells the story of a doomed party of Antarctic explorers who uncover the remains of a lost civilization, the Old Ones.  Turns out, these Old Ones bioengineered the Earth, but were vanquished by their own creations, who have now been reawakened by these unwitting explorers.<br />Lovecraft's writing is mannered and affected, which may keep him from a mass audience, but it retains a certain gothic power and he continues to be a cult favorite.<br />GRADE: B+	2000-10-13

They are not interested in 'foreplay'; they have no desire to stimulate the erogenous zones of the oppositre sex; they are selfish, greedy, clumsy, unsophisticated.  These complaints, you can't help feeling, are kind of ironic.  Back then, all we wanted was foreplay, and girls weren't interested.  They didn't want to be touched, caressed, stimulated, aroused; in fact, they used to thump us if we tried.  It's not really surprising, then, that we're not much good at all that.  We spent two or three long and extremely formative years being told very forcibly not even to think about it.  Between the ages of fourteen and twenty-four, foreplay changes from being something that boys want to do and girls don't, to something that women want and men can't be bothered with. ... The perfect match, if you ask me, is between the Cosmo woman and the fourteen-year old boy.<br />and the cultural importance of pop music:<br />People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching violent videos; we are scared that some sort of culture of violence will take them over.  Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands--literally thousands--of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss.  The unhappiest people I know, romantically speaking, are the ones who like pop music the most; and I don't know whether pop music hgas caused this unhappiness, but I do know that they've been listening to the sad songs longer than they've been living the unhappy lives.<br />and the vital interstices where men and women &amp; music meet, as we see when he asks his girlfriend one of the great questions in the history of the opposing genders:<br />How can you like Art Garfunkel and Solomon Burke?

But for whatever reason--one assumes it is simple discomfort with genuine religious beliefs--King cops out again and misses a golden opportunity to produce a really significant work.<br />At first glance folks may resist the suggestion that this book is a sort of modern Gospel; it is after all set on Death Row, with prison guards for apostles and the Messiah is a gargantuan simpleton who is also black and awaiting execution for the brutal murder of two young girls.  But John Coffey (get it, even his initials are J. C.) isn't just a convict, he is also an empath and he has the gift of healing.  His enormous stature and diminished intellect mask a soul in agony, for he is constantly buffeted by the evils of the world; he truly does feel our pain, all of our pain.  The guards, lead by Paul Edgecomb, come to believe in both his powerful gift and ultimately in his innocence.  But even after Paul proves beyond doubt that Coffey did not commit the crimes, they are forced to participate in his relentless destiny with the electric chair (Coffey's cross), even as Christ's disciples stood idly by while he was being crucified.  Coffey, like Christ, goes to his Golgotha without resisting, despite what we know to be his tremendous power--the path to Coffey's execution, the eponymous Green Mile, resembling Christ's trip down the Via Dolorosa.  And in the final and clinching parallel, Paul (as in Saint Paul) sees Coffey, or his spirit, again after his death.<br />The book then, narrated by Paul, is a Gospel of John Coffey, testifying to the miracles he worked and to his crucifixion and resurrection.  But after confidently leading us through these events, what conclusions does Paul/King draw?--that life is horrible and senseless because Coffey died.  It's as if Mark, Luke, John and Matthew had abandoned Christianity because Christ was executed.  I found this conclusion to be really disappointing.  That one could witness these miracles and wonders and not come away with some kind of faith struck a discordant note.<br />Overall, I liked the book, perhaps as much as anything that King has ever written, but as always seems to be the case with him, I thought he had a chance to hit a homerun and then settled for a double or triple.  He does deserve bonus points for accomplishing all of this in serial form.  This is the best serial novel since Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities, assuming that King really did write each installment separately and send them out as he finished.  The guy writes so fast he could easily have written the whole thing and sent it out one piece at a time.

I loathe communists in general.  And I think General Pinochet did the right thing when he overthrew Salvador Allende.  But somehow, I love this story of a young postman on Isla Negra, Chile and the relationship that he develops with his sole customer, the great communist poet Neruda.<br />Mario Jimenez has no desire to follow in the footsteps of his father and most of the other men of the island and become a fisherman.  So he leaps at the chance to take over a postal route that requires only that he deliver the voluminous correspondence that comes for the island's most famous resident.  Timidly at first and then more insistently, Mario calls upon Neruda to teach him about poetry and language.  Then, after meeting a luminous young bar maid named Beatrice, he demands that Neruda help him to woo her.  Eventually Mario wins her love, in large part through his own poetical devices, including an amusing string of metaphors.<br />When Salvador Allende assumes the Chilean presidency, Neruda is sent to France as ambassador and Mario becomes sort of a surrogate set of eyes and ears for the poet, sending him observations and recordings of daily life.  Initially, life is good in the new Chile, but things gradually deteriorate in an onslaught of shortages, work stoppages and violence.  Neruda, who in the intervening years has won the Nobel Prize for Literature, returns home to the island to die and Mario is whisked away &quot;for questioning.&quot;<br />Despite the down beat ending, this short novel is filled with memorable, if overly idealized, characters, for whom the author clearly has great affection, and scenes of thrilling erotic passion and it is animated by a sense of the beauty of language and poetry.  I recommend both the book and the Oscar winning movie adaptation of several years ago.<br />GRADE: A	2000-10-13

In fact, pretty  much all I know about Dr. Laura is that within days of the publication of this book she was all over  the Web buck naked, because an old flame sold some photos of her, and right now the Gay Lobby is  raising unholy hell with Paramount because they don't think she should have her own TV show.  Seems the good doctor has the temerity to refer to homosexuality as aberrant behavior and that's raised  some hackles.  But based on that little bit of info, I figured the book might at least be entertaining.  It  is.<br />Schlessinger and her rabbi coauthor have not set out to rewrite the Ten Commandments.  Nor are they  trying to author some weighty scholarly tome.  Instead, what we have here is a book that reflects the  strengths and weaknesses that you would expect of a conservative talk radio host.  It is a chatty,  opinionated, somewhat shallow, but topical and democratic (with a small d) survey of how the Mosaic  commandments pertain to modern life.<br />Here is how they render the commandments and how they interpret them:<br />  1. I am the Lord, your God, who has taken you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery  Acceptance of God as the ultimate author of morality and leaning of life.<br />  2. You shall not recognize the gods of others in My presence  Beware of idolatry. Attaining money, power, stimulation, professional success, and accumulating  possessions, while legitimate pursuits, are not the ultimate purpose of life.<br />  3. You shall not take the Name of the Lord, your God, in vain  How we acknowledge or deny God and godliness through our words and deeds.<br />  4. Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it  Recognize the value of time by refocusing on the most important elements of life; family,  obligations to others, prayer, kindness, justice, and decency.<br />  5. Honor your Father and your Mother  The obligation to parents reinforces the concepts of treating others responsibly in spite of  sentiment or situation.<br />  6. You shall not murder  Each human being is the essence of uniqueness, yet equally created in God's image. Not only can  a life by physically taken, but demoralization and humiliation can kill our souls.<br />  7. You shall not commit adultery  Sexual relations are made special and holy through a covenantal marriage. The honoring of  commitments provides the family stability necessary for individual growth and health, community  peace, and societal welfare.<br />  8. You shall not steal  Respecting the property and reputation of others provides mutual safety, peace, and prosperity.<br />  9. You shall not bear false witness against your fellow  While we should keep far from falsehoods, knowing when information could or should be shared  can make the differences between destroying and helping others.<br />  10. You shall not covet  Desire for the possessions of others destroys relationships and leads us to violate the other  Commandments.<br />Now one of the things that makes the Commandments themselves so remarkable is the degree to which  they remain universal and timely thousands of years after Moses came down from Mt. Sinai with  them.  But who hasn't looked askance at a few of the ten?  A couple of them just seem too parochial.  But the authors' section on idolatry--one of those concerns that does not on its face seem to be too  immediate--is a particularly good example of what makes the book useful.  We all tend to think of the  second commandment as an outdated injunction against golden calves and the like.  But they breath  life back into it by reading it as simply an admonition to keep the relationship with God and a God  centered morality at the forefront of our lives, rather than the pursuit of wealth or fame or physical  sensation.  At the point where any of these pursuits becomes the be all and end all of one's existence,  they partake of the nature of a new religion.  Cast in this fresh perspective, what seems at first glance  to be an antiquated call for monotheism (we are all monotheists now), becomes a timely call for  keeping our priorities straight.  Likewise, the section on keeping the Sabbath day reminds us that the  importance of the day is less that it be formulaically dedicated to God than that it be an opportunity  for us to step back from the hectic rush of daily life and focus on the things that are truly  important--foremost among them are faith and family.<br />Regardless of whether folks are any longer willing to admit it, our culture is by and large derived from  this decalogue, from the various subsequent covenants with God and from the Gospels.  Any book that  reminds us of that fundamental fact, and restores some vigor to the foundational laws of Western  Civilization, is worthwhile.  This is not the place to look if you want some scholarly dissertation on  the Commandments, but it is a perfectly acceptable look at why they remain important to our lives and  to the continued health of our society.<br />GRADE: C+mes the be all and end all of one's existence,  they partake of the nature of a new religion.

This makes for fascinating reading  and he wields the various sources masterfully, but it leads to a Jesus whose centrality to world history  seems to make little sense.<br />Crossan presents his arguments for what is most likely and most unlikely to have occurred and what it  all means.  For instance, he traces the various translation possibilities in the term leper and looks at the  Jewish kosher laws and concludes that healing the unclean may simply have meant being willing to  break bread with them.  Likewise, by examining Roman criminal law practices and burial traditions  for convicts, he argues that none of the disciples could possibly have known what happened to the  body of Christ after the crucifixion and that he must have been left to the dogs.  Ultimately, by  imposing such textual rigor, Crossan leaves us with a Jesus stripped of miracles, which is fine, but also  one who is, oddly, stripped of godliness.  Instead, he presents him as merely a radical egalitarian  Mediterranean Jewish Peasant.  This may also be the case, but how then do we explain his followers'  belief in the miracles and in Christ's divinity?  And how do we explain his subsequent influence on the  course of human history?<br />I disagreed with many of the interpretations and with this broader deChristifying of Jesus, but found  Crossan's arguments to be consistently thought provoking.  It is quite an enjoyable read.<br />GRADE: B	2000-10-11

The Spartan  King Leonidas lead 300 Knights ans some 700 Thespaian allies to the narrow pass at Thermopylae, in  order to hold the Persians back as long as possible. They proceeded to hold the pass for 7 days. These  300 Spartans died to a man defending the pass against a force of over a million and the epitaph provided to them by the poet Simonides, &quot;Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient  to their laws we lie&quot;, is perhaps the most famous in history. Their example rallied and inspired all of  Greece and eventually the Persians were defeated in the naval battle at Salamis and on land at Plataea.<br />Pressfield (whose only previous novel was the, by all accounts wretched, golf story The Legend of  Bagger Vance) has taken this story and created a novel that is not only a brilliant recreation of Ancient  Greece, but can also stand beside The Killer Angels (1974)(Michael Shaara 1929-1988) (Grade:  A+) as one of the great war novels of all time.<br />The story is told from the point of view of Xeones of Astakos, supposedly the sole survivor among the  Spartans, who Xerxes has tell his story to the court historian Gobartes.  Xeones starts with the tale of  how he came to Sparta. As a youth, his village of Astakos is destroyed and his family slaughtered, but  he and the cousin he loves, Diomache, escape. As they wander the countryside, Diomache is raped by  soldiers and Xeones is crucified after stealing a chicken, although Diomache saves him from death.  Thrown into despair, because his hands are so damaged that he can never wield a sword, Xeones heads  off by himself to die. But he experiences a visitation from the Archer god Apollo Far Striker and  realizes he can still wield a bow. When Diomache, who is also distraught after being violated by the soldiers, takes off, Xeones heads to Sparta where he hopes to join the army.<br />The middle section of the book, which I found interesting but slow, deals with his life in Sparta and  the training techniques used by the Spartans to create what was one of the most formidable fighting  forces the world has ever seen. Eventually he becomes the squire of one of the 300 knights who are  chosen for Thermopylae.<br />The final section, on the battle itself, depicts wholesale slaughter accompanied by acts of ineffable  courage. It also relates two of the great lines of all time. When Xerxes offers to spare the Spartans  lives if they will surrender their arms, Leonidas is reputed to have snarled, &quot;come and get them.&quot; And  upon being told that the Persians have so many bowmen that the cloud of arrows would blot out the  sun, one of the Spartans says, &quot;good, then we'll have our battle in the shade.&quot;<br />Having just read The Thin Red Line , where James  Jones presents war as a fundamentally nonsensical and tedious exercise, it was a real joy to read this  book. Pressfield captures the romantic side of war (recall Robert E. Lee's comment, &quot;It is good War is  so horrible else we would come to love it too much&quot;) by relating the true history of the Spartans  awesome sacrifice. In two of my favorite passages, he explains: (1) why this sacrifice is so beautiful to  us, &quot;In one way only have the gods permitted mortals to surpass them.

Rannulf Fitzwilliam is a Knight Templar who has sworn off  women and devoted his life to the service of Christ, specifically saving the city of Jerusalem from the  predations of the Saracens under Saladin.  Landless but proud, Rannulf makes enemies easily, but also  earns the devotion of the men who serve under him, earning the nickname Saint, which is applied both  sarcastically and in admiration.  His vow of chastity is sorely tested when he falls in love with the  haughty Princess Sibylla and his determination to preserve Jerusalem in Christian hands is threatened  by Saladin's repeated attacks, by treachery among the Christian defenders and by weak leadership,  including that of his beloved Sibylla.  All of this is handled quite well.<br />But on the other hand, the serendipitous interaction of this lowly warrior monk with the leading  figures of the Crusades strains the bounds of credulity.  Even more unbelievable is the gratuitous  sodomite subplot, which finds one of Rannulf's men engaged in a torrid affair with Saladin's son.  I'm  not big on buggery anyway, but this relationship seems more than unlikely.<br />I'll give it a qualified recommendation, chiefly because of the strong characterization of Rannulf and  Ms Holland's deftness at describing battles.<br />GRADE: C	2000-10-11

For one  thing, how important could any of it be if Christ hadn't even bothered to show up yet.  Then, the  stories are somehow just too senselessly brutal, the God they portray too inscrutable and all those lists  of names and those &quot;begats&quot; are just brain deadening.  Other than the Creation, the Garden of Eden  and the story of Moses and the Commandments, the rest of it never struck much of a chord.  So as I  was reading Frederick Buechner's novelization of the life of Jacob, I actually had to look the story up  in the Bible, because it just seems so bizarre.  You know some guy dressing up as a sheep to steal his  Father's blessing just isn't quite the same as the Sermon on the Mount.  But there it all is in the book of  Genesis.<br />Out of its spare phrases, and incidents like Esau literally trading his birthright for beans, Buechner  constructs an accessible, engaging, and witty story of family feuds, tribal enmities, sibling rivalry and  most of all of Man's uneasy relationship to God (or the Fear as the characters here refer to Him).  I  don't know that the book is suitable for all tastes--it's easy to imagine folks taking offense at some of  the ribaldry--but then, when you read the Biblical version, it's just as disturbing.<br />I'm still not sure absolutely sure what message this series of incidents is supposed to convey to us,  but  Buechner's telling gives them an immediacy that makes the tale, if nothing else, enjoyable and  memorable in a way that, truth be told, the original simply isn't..<br />GRADE: B	2000-10-11

All we knewwas that Kirk Douglas was a quintessential hero, there were amazinggladiator fights and battle scenes, Jean Simmons was babeolicious andeven the music made you feel like having a sword fight.  What morecould any red-blooded American kid want in a movie?  I believe wewatched it every single time they showed it, an honor shared only byThe Great Escape.<br />Several years ago, they issued a restored versionof the film.  Besides touching it up, they included a scene thecensors had cut, with Laurence Olivier asking Tony Curtis if he likedoysters or snails, the supposed import being to determine his sexualpreferences.  Even as an adult this scene is so subtle that it'shomoeroticism went soaring over my head.  Nor, even watching it as anadult, could I discern much Communist propaganda to the film.  It'smessage is clearly one of freedom, rather than of class warfare,despite a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo..<br />This emphasis is entirelyconsistent with what we know of the true course of events.  In hisinformative little book, Gladiators, the great popular historian ofthe Ancient World, Michael Grant, offers the following account ofSpartacus and the rebellion he led.  Spartacus (c. 109-71 B.C.),reputed to be a man of high intellect and sterling character, was aThracian who had served in the Roman Legions and then become a brigandbefore being sold into slavery as a deserter.  He was sent to Capua totrain as a gladiator, but in 73 B.C., he and 70 other slaves revolted.The rebels, mainly Thracians and Gauls, set up a camp at MountVesuvius to await Roman attack.  There they defeated a Roman armyunder Claudius Glaber and were soon joined by local shepherds andherdsmen who swelled their numbers.  They further fortified theirforces with freed slaves as they won successivevictories.<br />Spartacus, who harbored no illusions about their abilityto defeat Rome in the long run, consistently tried to restrain thefury of his pillaging troops and hoped to escape across the Alps.However, Crixus, one of his lieutenants, wished to go on ravagingRome, so he left, taking the Gauls with him.  Crixus and his band weresubsequently crushed in battle at Mount Garganus by four Romanlegions, led now by two consuls, Lucius Gellius and LentulusClodianus.  But when they turned their attention towards Spartacus, hemanaged to fight and defeat them separately at Picenum.<br />Spartacusmanaged to move his band as far north as Cisalpine Gaul, where hedefeated the governor, but for undetermined reasons, he then retreatedsouth.  Grant speculates that he may have been unable to control hisunruly army.  This was the high water mark of the rebellion as theRomans now sent out Crassus, a powerful millionaire/politician, whomanaged to corner Spartacus in the toe of Italy and proceeded to builda wall of fortifications to hold him there.<br />Spartacus did manage tobreak through this defensive line and the two sides battled acrossItaly, but the rebels were eventually vanquished by Crassus's superiornumbers.  The defeated followers of Spartacus, some six thousand ofthem, were strung in a line of crucifixes stretching from Rome toCapua, a savage reminder to their fellow slaves of the fate thatawaited them should they too challenge Rome.<br />Howard Fast wrote hisversion of this tale in 1950, while imprisoned for refusing to providenames to the House Un-American Activities Committee.  Perhaps notsurprisingly, his novel, though the tide of events forces him toacknowledge the degree to which the revolt Spartacus led was mainly abid for freedom, periodically lapses into the rhetoric of classwarfare, wishing to see the episode as a conflict which fits neatlyinto Marxist historical determinism.  This would be more legitimate ifhe had chosen to focus on Crixus, whose story lends itself more easilyto anti-Roman themes.  Fast seems to wish that Spartacus had been morelike Nat Turner, and that he had engaged in a suicidal attempt towreak vengeance and overthrow the upper class rulers of Rome, ratherthan trying to win to freedom.  These ideological yearnings somewhatmar the narrative, creating a weird tension between the course ofevents and the author's desires.<br />The narrative technique is alsosomewhat annoying.  The story is told in quite elliptical fashion,beginning with Spartacus already dead and looping back and forth intime to relate the story piecemeal.  This also means that thecharacters through whose experiences Fast tells the story aresometimes peripheral to the main storyline and are always lessinteresting than Spartacus himself.<br />One interesting aspect of thenovel is that it is much more direct about the homosexuality anglethan the movie, and not at all tolerant of it.  Fast leaves theoverwhelming impression that the homosexuality of Roman nobles likeCrassus was an indicator of the decline of Rome.  Their sexuality iscontrasted, quite unfavorably, with the brotherly love betweenSpartacus and his fellow gladiators and rebels.

After  the war, posted to a deadly dull Western fort, Wallace began writing to fill the empty hours.  Prompted by a casual discussion about the life and times of Jesus, he set this great story of revenge  against the backdrop of Christ's mission.<br />Judah Ben-Hur is a Jew of Jerusalem.  Arriving at manhood, he has become estranged from his  childhood friend Messala, a Roman noble.  The two exchange bitter words and when Ben-Hur later  accidentally dislodges a roof tile which strikes a Roman official, Messala has him sent to the galleys  and his mother and sister, Tirzah, sent to a leprosy infested prison cell.  As he is being led to the ship  on which he will be enslaved, Ben-Hur is offered a drink of water by an unforgettable stranger.  Onboard ship, Ben-Hur befriends the Roman admiral Arrius and, after saving his life, is made his heir  and a citizen of Rome.<br />Several years later, wealthy and well educated, Ben-Hur returns to Judea to look for his mother and  sister and wreak his revenge on Messala.  Vengeance comes when he vanquishes Messala in a chariot  race, but his family, freed from their squalid cell and suffering from leprosy, hide from him.  Meanwhile, Christ has come to Jerusalem preaching to increasing crowds and Ben-Hur, recognizing  the kindly stranger who once helped him, becomes a leader of a group of armed guards bent on  protecting him.  His devotion becomes all the more complete after Christ heals Tirzah and his mother.  But when the time comes, Ben-Hur heeds Christ's wishes and does not intervene.  He does manage to  return the long ago favor and give Christ a drink and remains to bear witness to the crucifixion.  The  story concludes with the increasingly wealthy Ben-Hur using his riches to fund the catacombs of Rome  from which Christianity would emerge to conquer the Empire.<br />It is no mystery why this is one of the most beloved of all American novels.

Tides of War advances the action to 430 B.C. with the outbreak of the  Peloponnesian War, which saw Sparta and the other city-states of Greece try to reign in the power of  Athens.  His story focusses on the fortunes of Alcibiades (451-404 B.C.), the most gifted, though  mercurial, leader of his day.  Alcibiades was adopted as a boy by Pericles, the great democratic leader  of Athens.  By all accounts, the boy was physically beautiful, intellectually gifted and moraly  unscrupulous.  He became a great disciple of Socrates, with whom he campaigned in Potidaea, but  contrary to the great philosophers teachings, determined to try his hand at politics.  He became the  worst kind of populist, opportunistic, demagogue--ultimately fighting for Athens three different times,  but also joining the Spartans and even the Persians during periods when he had been exiled from  Athens.  He was the driving force behind the ill-advised decision to try to conquer Syracuse (415-13  B.C.), which may have been the single most significant factor contributing to Athen's eventual  downfall, as the Expedition proved to be a disastrous drain on men and materiel.<br />Once again, Pressfield turns in an impressive performance.  He's working on a broader canvas here,  but demonstrates an admirable command of history, customs, battle tactics, and multiple other  subjects.  He is especially good at depicting battle scenes, with all their inextricable twining of  confusion, brutality and heroism.<br />I did find the narrative structure of the book to be awkward.  A grandson relates the tale that his  grandfather heard from one of the men who was tried for assassinating Alcibiades.  This results in  three separate narrative tracks, indicated by italics and brackets and the whole thing takes on the nature  of a Rube Goldberg contraption.  Having the entire story told in the first person also makes the  author's linguistic choices more noticeable, which seems like a bad idea.  Even if you're eager to  suspend disbelief, you end up noticing the uneasy fit between passages that seem as if they are meant  to sound somewhat archaic and others that sound like film noir banter.  It just doesn't seem like the  immediacy of a first person narrator is worth all the hoops it forces author and reader to leap through.<br />There is also a significant problem with the dramatic structure of the story.  For all his undeniable  talent and charisma, at the end of the day Alcibiades is merely another tyrant, who put his own  fortunes ahead of those of his country.  Moreover, his various plots and stratagems were responsible  for the decline and fall of the world's first great democracy.  I suppose most everyone goes through a  phase in youth where the Napoleons of the world seem like romantic figures--men who restore order  out of chaos and bend the world to their will, however briefly.  Perhaps it's simply a sign of age that I  no longer find such men sympathetic, now they just strike me as trumped up bureaucrats who think  they know better than anyone else how the world should work.  I think the term that Pressfield uses is  &quot;necessity&quot;, which I guess he derives from the historical record, Alcibiades always thinks he knows  what is necessary at any given moment.  If the intervening 2400 years have taught us anything, it is  that one man, or group of men, never know what is necessary; they merely impose their own vision on  a typically unwilling populace with predictably disastrous results, as here.<br />In fact, I found the story most effective as a cautionary tale of the dangers inherent in depending on  charismatic leadership and of trying to make direct democracy work.  In I. F. Stone's book The Trial  of Socrates, he tries to reconcile his own veneration of Athenian-style democracy  with the, to him, inexplicable decision to execute the great philosopher.  But the great lesson of that  episode and of the career of Alcibiades is that the polity of such a democracy is &quot;a beast needing to be  fed&quot;, driven by emotion and envy, not an enlightened and rational body.  The unfettered citizenry of  Athens is really pretty scary and men like Alcibiades, who would exploit the baser instincts (in  particular, the imperial pretensions) of the beast for personal gain, can in no wise be considered  heroes, however bold and fascinating they may be.<br />Despite these concerns, I do strongly recommend the book.  One of the great deficits of the modern  education is how little we learn of Greek and Roman Civilization.  Books like this one, which help to  fill the gaps, and do it in a lively and accessible way, are invaluable.  I don't much like Alcibiades, but  I certainly enjoyed reading about him.<br />GRADE: B+to make direct democracy work.  In I. F.

Without succumbing to gargantuism (his novels are generally under 300 pages) or obscurantism (the  stories are pretty straightforward &amp; the linguistic pyrotechnics are minimal) or fishing for a best seller,  he managed to produce novels that are both thrilling and thought provoking.<br />In Black Robe he describes a journey by two Jesuits in 17th century Canada on a mission to relieve a  dying priest.  With considerable empathy and insight, he portrays Father Paul Laforgue's near-suicidal  longing to be a martyr for Christ; the sexual torment of young Daniel Davost, Laforgue's protege who  has been seduced by a native girl; and the mixture of superstitious fear and hatred that they provoke in  the native tribes.  The action that ensues when these two white men come in contact with the natives,  will test all of their beliefs.  As Moore describes it in his Introduction:<br />  the Indian belief in a world of night and in the power of dreams clashed with the Jesuits'  preachments of Christianity and a paradise after death.  This novel is an attempt to show that each  of these beliefs inspired in the other fear, hostility, and despair, which later would result in the  destruction and abandonment of the Jesuit missions, and the conquest of the Huron people by  the Iroquois, their deadly enemy.<br />Moore states his own case a little too pessimistically, the clash of cultures that he presents is indeed  brutal, but it is not futile.  In the novel's closing scene, Laforgue who has despaired of his own  worthiness to be a martyr, despite withstanding torture, abandonment by Davost and the murder of the  priest they came to replace, agrees to baptize native villagers who are being ravaged by the plague; not  necessarily because he believes that their conversion is genuine or that it will save them, but simply  because he loves them and because, finally, he believes that God loves them all.  Despite the brutality  and destructiveness of these initial encounters between the Blackrobes and the Indians, it is this ethos  of Christian love that eventually won the day and brought civilization to Canada and its native  population.  I know it's not a popular thing to say, but...that's a good thing.<br />GRADE: B+he believes that God loves them all.

The  concept of this fighting force made up of desperate men of all nations, given a new lease on life  because they did not have to give their real name or background when they signed up, lent itself easily  to fiction and to childhood fantasy.  I don't remember all of the Foreign Legion movies we watched  but Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion (1950) and March or Die (1977) [bad movie, great  tagline: &quot;In the French Foreign Legion, you march or you die!&quot;] spring to mind, and of course the  greatest of them all was Beau Geste (1939).  Directed by William Wellman and starring Gary Cooper,  Ray Milland, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy and Susan Hayward, it was one of those movies you had  to watch every time it was on.  Happily, the original novel is nearly its equal.<br />The three Geste brothers, orphaned early in life, are raised by an Aunt.  Their raucous youths are filled  with the literature of adventure and ritualized horseplay centered around these myths and legends.  So  when the family's prized Blue Water sapphire turns up missing, each of the young men confesses to  being the thief in order to protect the others and one by one they head off to join the French Foreign  Legion.  As luck would have it, they meet up in the deserts of Africa where they fall under the  command of the malevolent Sergeant Lejaune.  Not content to merely be a martinet, Lejaune sets his  sights on stealing the jewel, which rumor holds to be in their possession.  Meanwhile, the unruly  troops he commands are planning a mutiny and the marauding Tauregs pin this badly outnumbered  and bitterly divided unit of Legionnaires at Fort Zinderneuf.  The ensuing drama plays itself out as the  French forces battle overwhelming odds.  Ultimately, only a handful of men survive to discover the  truth behind the Blue Water's disappearance.<br />It just doesn't get any better than that central story.  Wren combines  a classic mystery and a desert  adventure.  The Gestes are living embodiments of the tales on which they were weaned--generous,  noble, brave and loyal.  My only real complaint is with the framing device which surrounds the  story.  The novel opens with a major who lead the relief column sent to Zinderneuf describing what he  found there and concludes with an overlong d&eacute;nouement getting the story back to England and the  jewel mystery.  But these are minor quibbles when set against the truly thrilling story at the heart of  the novel.

Men and women have spent the past 100,000 years or so trying to figure each other out and I'll readily  admit that I understand less of this mystery than most other members of the species.  After reading the  highly acclaimed Lorrie Moore's coming of age tale, I believe that much of what I thought I knew  was wrong.<br />Benoite-Marie Carr, Berie for short, is in Paris with the husband she doesn't love.  She keeps flashing  back to the pivotal relationship in her life, the bond she shared with Sils Chausbee, one summer when  both were 15 years old and on the verge of adulthood in 1970's Horsehearts, New York.  Berie was  skinny, pre-menstrual and self-conscious, where Sils was bodacious &amp; outgoing.  Days they worked  togetherat a local theme park, Berie taking tickets while Sils played Cinderella.  Nights they snuck out  to bars or drank liquor stolen from their parents.  Men would be drawn to Sils &amp; Berie would snatch  up her leftovers.  Still virginal &amp; naive, they did little more than dance with these men, until Sils met  the bland motorcycle riding Mike.  This new relationship put distance between them, until Sils wound  up pregnant &amp; Berie stole the money for her abortion from work.  When the theft was discovered,  Berie was sent off to a Christian summer camp &amp; then to boarding school and the two lost touch with  one another.<br />Now, I think we've  all known folks like Sils in our lives, or if not known them personally, we're  familiar with the type on a larger scale--for convenience sake, let's call them Alphas or Illuminati.  They are people with such force of will, or in Sils' case beauty, that they are nearly luminescent, with  electric personalities.  And we, or others, are too often content to bask in their auras or live off of the  excess sparks they throw off.  Such people change our lives and change the world because they are  capable of diminishing our selves.  These people can be great forces for good and/or evil; for every  Moses, Christ, Luther, Washington, Ted Williams or Reagan there's a Jim Jones, Caesar, Robespierre,  Lenin, Hitler, Charles Manson, OJ Simpson or Clinton.  If we are strong willed, or lucky, enough,  we choose those who are forces for good &amp; even then, we must retain our capacity to judge these  people as we judge others, rather than being swept away by them.<br />In the relationship of Berie and Sils we see, writ small, why these people are so dangerous.  Sils is no  better a person than Berie.  In fact, she comes across as a fairly vacuous, albeit beautiful, addlepated  girl.  But Berie surrenders her will to Sils and becomes her partner in delinquency.  The danger arises  because people like Sils are fundamentally irresponsible; they never face the consequences of their  own actions.  There is always a Berie, or a Marc Anthony or a Johnnie Cochran or a George  Stephanopoulus there to pick up the pieces and protect them from  the fallout &amp; try to thwart justice.  Their acolytes enable them to live lives largely devoid of accountability.<br />What Moore has rendered then is a portrait of a woman who abetted the Alpha who overwhelmed her  in childhood and has never moved beyond this most self-destructive relationship in her life.  One of  the consequences is that subsidiary characters are fairly opaque.  The sections with Berie's husband,  for instance, convey little to help us understand why the two are married, so who cares that the  marriage is disintegrating.  It's as if Moore, like Berie, was so obsessed by Sils as not to care about the  rest of the novel.  The other major consequence is that you just want someone to grab Berie &amp; shake  her &amp; tell her to grow up.  It's hard to sympathize with this woman who seems to be alone and  friendless and trapped in an idealized past.<br />I found the book compulsively readable, it's blessedly short,  and I think Moore's a potentially  interesting author, but my enjoyment of the book was limited by her seeming failure to fathom and  judge the pathologies of her main characters.<br />GRADE: Ceming failure to fathom and  judge the pathologies of her main characters.<br />GRADE: C	2000-10-10

Hatsue Miyamoto stands accused of killing Carl  Heine, Jr., the son of Etta Heine, who essentially stole the land that the Miyamoto's were about to  finish buying before they were shipped to the Manzanar concentration camp in 1942.  Carl, Jr. was  found in his own fishing net, drowned and with his skull stove in, and Miyamoto's was the closest  boat.  In addition, Carl's blood is on Miyamoto's gaff, one of his lines is found tied to a cleat on  Miyamoto's boat and Miyamoto refuses to explain these anomalies.<br />As the trial unfolds, local newspaper editor Ishmael Chambers is flooded with memories.  He had a  secret love affair with the young Japanese girl who later married Miyamoto and he lost an arm  fighting the Japanese in the South Pacific.  Now it appears that he may be the only thing that stands  between Miyamoto and a guilty verdict.<br />There is really no way to avoid the fact that only the Jim Crow laws compare to the Internment of the  Japanese during World War II as the low point for civil rights in this country.  Even Slavery and the  annihilation of the Indians made sense within the context in which they occurred.  But the rounding  up of American citizens, in 1942 under the provisions of Executive Order 9066, simply because of  their race, was genuinely despicable.  And it is especially important to recall that it was the act of two  of the deities of 20th century American Liberalism--FDR and Earl Warren.  This is instructive both  for what it tells us about the men, that just like Bull Connor or Lester Maddox they placed their own  political interests ahead of human rights, as well as for what it tells us about the terror a democracy is  capable of imposing.  It is significant to note that the Japanese were rounded up only in states where  they wielded little political power.  Hawaii, which had actually been attacked and where they were a  much larger portion of the population, made no effort to intern it's population, in no small part,  because they represented a political force to be reckoned with later.<br />So how can you not fall prostrate and worshipful before this oh so earnest tale of racism in the Pacific  Northwest in the 40's and 50's?  How about, because the author stacks the deck so badly on one side  that the book is devoid of even the semblance of dramatic tension.<br />Here's the first sentence of the novel:<br />  The accused man, Kabuo Miyamoto, sat proudly upright with a rigid grace, his palms placed softly  on the defendant's table--the posture of a man who has detached himself insofar as possible at his  own trial.<br />From this unambiguous beginning, Miyamoto is subsequently cloaked in ever increasing layers of  nobility, until the very concept that he could have committed this crime is almost laughable.  So we're  not exactly engulfed in a mystery here.<br />Does the trial tell us something about racism?  Well, no.  Given the excruciatingly contrived set up of  the evidence in Carl, Jr's death, it would have been irresponsible not to try Miyamoto for the murder.  Is the process itself corrupted by bigotry?  Hardly.  Judge, prosecutor and defense attorney all seem  trapped in a trial they don't really believe in.<br />So what's the point?  In one of the interviews below, Guterson claims that he was influenced by  Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.  However, when Lee wrote her book it was an act of political  courage for a Southern woman to honestly portray the racist Southern justice system.  And Atticus  Finch put himself, his children and his legal practice at risk in order to defend an unjustly accused  black man.  No character here is taking similar risks and Guterson is so risk averse that he nearly  beatifies his Japanese american characters.  There is really no similarity between the two books and  Guterson does not deserve to be compared to Lee.<br />The end result is the literary equivalent of The Shawshank Redemption.  Everything in the book is predictable from the moment you read the dust jacket.  The  only interest remaining is the forlorn hope that you're wrong and there's some plot twist coming.  Moreover, it is a sorry statement on the state of our public morality that critics have praised the book  for the quality of the moral choice that Ishmael finally makes.  Where I come from, you don't accrue  much spiritual credit for revealing the facts that clear an innocent man, even if you did want him out  of the way so you could shtup his wife.<br />It's not a bad book.  It has some redeeming qualities, not least of which is reminding our historically  challenged society about the internment of innocent Japanese citizens during the War.  But it is just so  intellectually lazy and morally flaccid that it's hard to recommend it.<br />GRADE: C-Everything in the book is predictable from the moment you read the dust jacket.

The  story starts in Haiti where twelve year old Sophie has been raised by her aunt, Tante Atie, while her  mother supports the family with a job in New York.  But now her mother wants Sophie to come and  join her.  There's a beautifully detailed portrait of country life in Haiti here and the separation of  Sophie and Atie is genuinely heart rending.<br />The next section details the tentative first steps of Sophie and her mother as they feel out the  parameters of a mother-daughter relationship.  This is complicated by the fact that Sophie was the  product of her mother being raped as a teenager by a Tonton Macout.<br />This transition from Haiti to New York is fine and would be a solid basis for a novel, but Danticat  now starts skipping forward in large chunks of time.  Suddenly, Sophie is 18 and enamored of an  older neighbor who is a musician.  Her scandalized mother begins to probe her nightly to establish  that she has maintained her virginity.  Tempers explode and we skip ahead again.  Sophie has married  the musician and had a child, but she's estranged from her mother, has developed sexual phobias and  has fled to Haiti with her child.  From here the novel descends into all the worst topicality of the 90's  and we see how it made Oprah's Book Club.  We're immersed in bulimia, sexual dysfunction, female  genital mutilation, therapy, suicide, etc.<br />Ultimately,  after a strong and promising beginning, I have to say that the author lost me.  I  appreciated the opportunity to be exposed to a side of Haitian life that we rarely see, but then we're  buried in a blizzard of psychoblither.  I expect to see better from this author in the future.<br />GRADE: C-	2000-10-10

Unable to come to terms with  their deaths, the boys have grown old obsessing over them.  They've turned the suicides into the stuff  of myth and made them the touchstones of their lives.<br />But what if we readers aren't affected in the same way?  Sorta weakens the narrative structure, huh?<br />One of the great lies we tell ourselves is that deaths, but especially suicides, have some great secret  meaning.  For instance, what really gave the Whitewater scandal legs was Vince Foster killing  himself.  On some level, we all &quot;knew&quot; that he had to have died to hide some terrible secret.  But  what if he was just a weak, overburdened man who felt like quitting?  What if deaths like his tell us  nothing important?  Well, that just doesn't seem fair somehow.  In the first place, we have an  understandable desire that the tragedy have some meaning.  But secondly, and probably more  importantly, we get a vicarious thrill from these things and don't want to be cheated out of the  opportunity to wallow in them.  If we can inflate them with portent, however false, we get to wrap  them around us and roll around in them like pigs in slop, while claiming that we're concerned about  their broader implications (witness these Columbine H.S. shootings).<br />Eugenides has basically rendered an extended wallow without even bothering to look for reasons.

The only thing going for us was we had a fast car and a good-sized bag of crank.  We were  dumb to think that might be enough.  -Marjorie &quot;The Speed Queen&quot; Standiford<br />This is Marjorie's story, as dictated to a tape recorder, on Death Row in an Oklahoma prison.  She's  the most notorious thrill killer in America, but before she's put to death for the murder of 12 people,  she wants to tell her side of the story and, in particular, she wants to answer the &quot;lies&quot; in Natalie's best  selling account of their crime spree.  She's even found the perfect vehicle to guarantee that the world  hears her story, she's chosen Stephen King to tell it.<br />What follows is a funny, frightening, disingenuous tale of sex and drugs and fast food and muscle cars  and way too many Diet Pepsis, as Marjorie, her husband Lamont, their baby  and their lover Natalie  descend into a speed driven paranoid night of violence.  Meanwhile, not content merely giving her  version of events, she provides a running comparison of parts of her story &amp; elements of King's  novels and offers him advice on how to improve upon her story when he pens the intended roman a  clef.<br />Most of the folks I know will need to know little more than that the two epigraphs that precede the  story are from James M. Cain's Double Indemnity and Golden Earring's Radar Love--hell, I was ready  to recommend it based on that alone.  But the novel itself is a blistering, funny, mesmerizing,  horrifying read.

In Chinatown,  everyone knew our story.  Outsiders jerked their chins, looked at us, shook their heads.  We heard things.  -Fae Myenne Ng, Bone<br />Thus begins Fae Myenne Ng's excellent novel about three sisters growing up in San Francisco's  Chinatown.  The story that everyone knows is how the middle sister, Ona, committed suicide by  jumping off of the Nam, a local housing project officially named the Nam Ping Yuen.  The novel tells  of the struggle of the narrator, the eldest sister Leila, and her mother, stepfather and sister to deal with  this death and the guilt they all feel.  Mah, the mother, feels that it's a result of bad luck brought on  by the affair she had with her boss.  Leon, the father, thinks the tragedy struck because he violated his  vow to ship his father's bones back to China.  The sisters are sure that they could have stopped it if  they'd had just one more conversation with her.  But these explanations, of course, prove  unsatisfactory and the story unfolds almost like a mystery as Leila's memory flashes back to  reconstruct this family's life and the chain of events that must somehow have lead Ona to that rooftop.<br />But this novel is more than just a Chinese version of Ordinary People.  It often seems that American  Culture has only two versions of the Chinese that it trots out over and over.  In crime melodramas  they are always either the evil Chinese warlord or the chopsocky sidekick.  In everything else, Chinese  Americans are two dimensional drones--hard working, barely human, super successful, over  achievers--who practically define the American Dream.  Neither of these images has been undermined  by the Clinton administration's scandal's which feature Chinese generals and spies on the one hand  and,  on the other hand, seemingly simple gardeners, resterauntuers and nuns with millions to  contribute to politics.<br />Ng asks us to consider what kind of pressures and recriminations a Chinese American family would  face if they failed to achieve the American Dream.  Suppose the laundry business goes bust and the  savings are wiped out.  Suppose after a lifetime of hard work, they're still stuck in the same apartment  in the same neighborhood they started out in.  What's life like when the dreams don't all come true?  And how do the children in this family escape without feeling like traitors and without turning their  backs on their heritage?<br />These are the questions that Ng seeks to answer.  In so doing, she affords us a glimpse at a community  that is truly foreign to us.  Foreign not merely because of ethnicity, but because of the too facile  stereotypes that we've been saddled with by an indolent media and by a political class where both sides  have a vested interest in perpetuating the myths.<br />Like all fiction of this sort, the blame and the wallowing in sorrow gets to be a little tedious, but just  when she's in danger of losing us, the novel ends on a wonderful life affirming note.  I liked it very  much.<br />GRADE: B+kind of pressures and recriminations a Chinese American family would  face if they failed to achieve the American Dream.

So when you see these words--&quot;intricate&quot;,  &quot;labyrinthine&quot;, &quot;byzantine&quot;--in all of the reviews of this book, you know you are in trouble; these are  not adjectives that lead one to believe that the story will be readily understandable.  But, they are  accurate; this book is so complex as to be incomprehensible.  I finally gave up on this one after trying  to read it about five different times.<br />The best Historical Fiction takes great events with which we are familiar but brings an added human  dimension to them, first by fleshing out the basic situations via fictional narrative techniques  (dialogue, characters thoughts, etc.), but second, by taking the historical context and peopling it with  living characters.  There is a great difference between the Claudius of a Roman History book and the  Claudius of Robert Graves' novels.  Graves' achievement is that he breathes life into Claudius and  makes him a virtual contemporary of ours, which adds immediacy to the historic circumstances and  gives us a vested interest in what occurs.  History essentially is transformed into the present.<br />In All Soul's Rising, on the other hand, Bell plops the reader down in the midst of the incredibly  violent Haitian revolt at the turn of the 19th Century and through the use of shifting perspectives,  allows the reader access to the experiences of those caught up in it, but he provides no context for  what is occurring.  Basically he's trying to tell the story of a riot from the viewpoint of the rioters;  there's just a whirl of events, the meaning of which is impossible to decipher.  There are scenes of  elaborate torture and violence, but we are so deeply thrust into the story that we have no idea how  they connect back to the tides of history.  The book seems to be about nothing more than the racial  violence itself, disconnected from any rhyme or reason.<br />Perhaps this is partly Bell's intent, to demonstrate that all racial violence is senseless?  I do know that  in one of the interviews online, he says that he sees the Haitian Uprising as a metaphor for American  race relations.  Huh?  In what conceivable way are they comparable?  The only really significant  outbreak of violence in the history of American race relations is the Civil War, when whites fought  each other over the issue.  Jim Crow, while a repellent feature of our History, was brought to an end  with virtually no violence at all (the murders of Civil Rights workers the sporadic church bombings  and the police attacks on demonstrators stand out precisely because they were the exception to the  rule).  Perhaps Bell's interest in tying the Revolt to American History caused him to lose sight of  Haitian and French History and to cut the story loose from it's historical moorings.  Whatever the  case, with his focus wholly on particular isolated events, Bell fails to place the entire story into any  broader context; like the blind men describing an elephant, all is detail, there is no whole.<br />GRADE: Fhave no idea how  they connect back to the tides of history.

This book, it isn't really a novel but 22 interlinked  stories, depicts a life where alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, car wrecks and violence compete with history  for a claim on the residents' souls and where the worst epithet is &quot;apple&quot;, an Indian who is red on the  outside but white on the inside.  The cumulative impact of the stories is to create a sense of despair.  It  seems like the characters are unwilling to break out of a hopeless cycle of doom, defeatism and  failure.<br />The best of the stories, &quot;This Is What it Means to say Phoenix, Arizona&quot;, offers a glimpse at the  possibility for something better.<br />The stories are relatively free of the New Age wise Indian pabulum we see so much of and despite a  few dated and silly references to things like El Salvador, overt politics doesn't intrude much.  Best of  all, Alexie does not make excuses for his characters.  He recognizes that their dismal lives are the  product of conscious choices, but that the choices are bad ones. This is the great strength of the book,  his ability to judge the characters harshly, yet present them with obvious affection.<br />However bleak, this is a very interesting book.<br />GRADE: B-	2000-10-08

And many of them will get published,  because reader passion for personal nonfiction (as well as an urge to share on the part of anyone  who has ever been abused, gotten drunk, felt ugly, or gone crazy) has only intensified in our  Oprahfied culture of empowering public confession.  Everyone's story is interesting to someone, of  course, but at this point in the literary onslaught, I've gotten tough on what it takes to hold my  interest : A memoir is worth finishing only if (1) the life lived is so extraordinary that the  ordinariness of the writing is of little importance, or (2) the writing is so extraordinary that the  ordinariness of the life is of little importance.  In fact, ordinariness transformed into art becomes  the whole point of the Cinderella endeavor.&quot;  -Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly (reviewing Mary Karr's memoir : Cherry)<br />Little remarked in the current memoir craze is the fact that an entire generation of writers is wasting  the material that authors have traditionally mined for their first novels, their own life experiences.  Instead of taking advantage of the personally and stylistically liberating form and techniques which  fiction offers, they are inundating us with half-baked recollections of the very specific circumstances  of their own lives.  Half-baked because real life does not provide the kind of closure and narrative  structure that fiction does, nor does non-fiction allow the authors to really plumb the psychological  depths of those who people their stories.  Instead, they give us stories where they share all too much  about themselves, but the folks they interact with, most often parents, are little more than cardboard  cutouts.  This is a limitation imposed by the form they have chosen.  After all, at the point where they  start speculating about the motivations, feelings and thoughts of others they are no longer writing  non-fiction but have instead veered into the field of supposition, of fiction.  this presents a series of  problems : first, that what is presented as factual often smacks of the fictional; second, that characters  other than the author tend to appear so opaque as to defy our understanding; and, finally, that the  authors miss out on a real opportunity to try to understand the people who influenced their lives.  Where fiction would force them to see the story through the eyes of the other characters, memoir  restricts them to their personal, and obviously incomplete, perspective.  The books that memoirists  produce, with rare exceptions, serve neither the author nor the reader well.<br />All of these weaknesses are on display in Richard Wertime's memoir, Citadel on the Mountain.  The  central figure in the book is his father Ted Wertime, a domineering, violent, atavistic man who held  his family in some kind of mysterious thrall.  A former member of the OSS during WWII, the father  may or may not have subsequently been a CIA operative, but at any rate he did serve in posts in Iran,  the Far East and elsewhere which seem to suggest that he remained in the clandestine intelligence  field.  Whatever his secret duties entailed, he did become an expert on early technologies, specifically  on ancient metallurgy, and eventually went to work at the Smithsonian and published several long  essays in the Washington Post in the mid-70's.<br />The book offers little information about how the entire process occurred, perhaps because the author  does not know himself, but Ted Wertime gradually became a kind of monstrous combination of John  Brown and the Unabomber.  He physically controlled and psychologically manipulated his family, to  the point of choosing sexual partners for his sons and forcing his wife to accept his mistress as a part  of the household.  He retreated to a fortress-like home on a mountaintop in Pennsylvania, to which he  browbeat his sons into returning again and again.  There he awaitedhis own weird version of the  apocalypse, an end of days which he envisioned being brought on by man's overreliance on  technology and by the resulting environmental degradation.<br />You can see from that bare outline that there's the basis for an interesting story here.  Ted Wertime  was the kind of dangerous fanatic with whom we've become all too familiar, a David Koresh of the  radical environmental set.  The reader would like to know how he got that way, what made him tick,  and, most importantly, why his family allowed him to get away with his repellent social behavior.  Unfortunately, that's not what the book gives us.  There is never a moment where you can  comprehend why Richard Wertime loved his father, let alone tolerated the way he treated his mother.  In the final pages he makes a seeming attempt to justify his father; and what does he offer : &quot;How  hard he'd worked to become a scholar!;&quot;  his love of music, sports and the outdoors; and his talent for  reading aloud to his sons and neighborhood kids.  That's an awfully meager set of positives to try to  balance out the genuinely disturbing set of character traits he's depicted previously.  As he concludes  the book, it is clear that he loved, still loves, his father, but I have no idea why.  At a minimum, the  book should have explained that one basic thing.<br />If Richard Wertime ever takes this raw material and turn it into a novel, I'll be interested to see what  he comes up with.

I was a sophomore  at Colgate and, if memory serves (which is doubtful), it was a Monday night in February.  I and some  fellow fraternity brothers adjourned to the basement for a long night of Television and a few frothy  beverages.  To our chagrin, we found an elder Brother seated before the TV and a Hallmark Hall of  Fame special about to begin.  None of us had ever heard of that night's special presentation--callow  youths that we were, we had hoped for an episode of Solid Gold--but Joe Doggett, the sage who had  staked a claim, told us to sit down and shut up.  We sat slack-jawed for the next two hours as Les  Miserables, starring Richard Jordan and Anthony Perkins, unfolded before us and claimed our rapt  attention.  Suffice it to say, we were all amazed at this great story that we'd never even heard of, a  story which by itself justifies the existence of France..  I ran out the next day to get the book, but was  put off by its elephantine girth.<br />Flash forward a few years and the story had been turned into the much ballyhooed Musical--now  everyone was reading it.  In fact, we had a beach house at the Jersey shore and Tim Dowling decided  it was the perfect beach book.  He'd tote the thousand-plus-page tome down to the beach every day,  read two pages and fall fast asleep.  But you see, that's the kind of book it is--the narrative is so long  and digresses so often that it must certainly qualify as one of the most put-downable books of all  time.  I finally did manage to mule through the whole thing, and buried within it is the great story we  saw that night on television, but you've got to dig pretty deep to find it.<br />So, when it came time to review the book for the site, I admit I resorted to an abridged version.  The  translation and abridgment is by James K. Robinson and I highly recommend it.  Gone are the endless  pages on farming techniques and the like, along with the lengthy description of Waterloo, by the end  of which you simply had no idea what was going on in the battle.  What remains is just the classic  story of the convict Jean Valjean: his redemption;  his rise in society; his repeated flights from the  relentless Inspector Javert;  his love for Cosette; and his Oedipal rivalry with young Marius for  Cosette's affection.<br />Even if you don't know the story, you've encountered it before; most famously, the TV series The  Fugitive borrowed freely from the plot, even down to naming the police pursuer Gerard.  I mentioned  in my Man With the Golden Arm review the similarities that book shares with this one.  The one great  weakness that they share is the over sympathetic view of the poor in general and criminals  specifically.  But more instructive for our purposes are the differences.  Chief among these is that,  whereas Algren and Richard Wright in Native Son have the lower class milieu,  the oppressive law enforcement and the manhunt down pat, only Hugo includes the element of  redemption.  For all his reputation as a writer of the Left, there is something profoundly conservative  in the arc of Jean Valjean's life.  First Monseigneur Bienvenu in saving Valjean makes it clear that he  is performing, not simply a good deed but, a Christian act:<br />  Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good.  It is your soul that I buy  from  you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.<br />It's hard to imagine authors of the modern Left: writing favorably of a cleric; believing that men have  souls; or, acknowledging that criminal behavior is evil.  Then, although his ill-gotten wealth gives  him an obvious head start, Valjean is able to start a business and succeed largely on the basis of a new  idea and the sweat of his brow.  Finally, Hugo presents a fairly non-materialistic view of the world  and of human happiness.  Of course, it helps to have his wealth tofall back on, but Jean Valjean is not  made happy by the worldly goods he gains through means both legal and extralegal, his true happiness  comes when he experiences human love for the first time, with Cosette.  In fact, the heroic actions of  the novel consistently require the actor to give up or endanger wealth and position in order to sacrifice  for others.  Bienvenu, Javert and Valjean all have their moments of transcendence when they act  completely selflessly.  For me at least, it is these moments that really make the book.  I can still recall  the scene in the TV movie, lo those many years ago, when Valjean, risking discovery by Javert, lifts  the horse cart off of a man who is being crushed.

I find that the tendency to cram some epiphany into  each brief episode tends to strain credulity.  This problem becomes more pronounced if you read  several stories in a row.  Canin's tales are no exception; each of these technically competent stories  finds a character or set of characters confronting some pivotal moment in their lives.<br />Beyond this general characteristic of short stories, I found one of the themes here to be troubling.  Several times one character (a philandering father, a violent brother) tells another that he's going to  grow up to be just like the speaker.  Since he mentions this concept repeatedly, I assume Canin puts  some stock in it, but it flies in the face of free will &amp; seems entirely too fatalistic. In addition, this  collection came out while the author was in medical school and most of the stories include some  medical condition or deformity.  After you come across the first couple, the rest seem almost  gratuitous.<br />For me, the collection is redeemed by the title story.  Therein, an elderly man, who has recently had  heart problems, becomes agitated when his callow neighbor wants him to cut down a 200 year old bug  infested elm tree.  Conditioned by fare like Neighbors (Thomas Berger) and The Man Who Loved  Levittown (WD Wetherell). we think we see where the stories headed, especially when the old man  changes into suburban camouflage gear.  But Canin gives the story a delightful &amp; life affirming twist.<br />I ended up admiring the author's craftsmanship, but not particularly liking his stories.  I will,  however, read more of his stuff in the future.<br />GRADE: C	2000-10-08

First, the almost complete absence of ideas in his work.  Second, how obvious it is that his work is fundamentally about either repressed or closeted  homosexuality.<br />First things first; reading these stories and comparing what's actually on the page to the central  position that Kafka holds among critics in 20th Century literature, I couldn't help thinking of  Chauncey Gardiner.  He, of course, is the simple minded hero of Jerzy Kozinski's great book Being  There.  Having spent his whole life within the grounds of a mansion gardening and watching TV, he  enters the world completely unprepared to interact with his fellow man.  But the people he meets  inflate his non sequitirs into faux profundities and he is soon advising the President of the United  States.  He is a blank slate upon which other people scribble and then interpret their own ideas as  genius.  In much the same way, Kafka wrote a series of completely autobiographical tales, and an  unpleasant autobiography it is: grown men living at home with their parents; working menial jobs in  huge bureaucracies; terrified of marriage; bullied by overbearing fathers;  plagued by illness,  nightmares and feelings of alienation from all around them except for one loving sister.  This was  Kafka's own life and these are the common threads that run throughout his work.  But add them all  together and what you get is a situation, not a set of ideas.  Kafka endlessly rewrites the situation that  he found himself in; noticeably absent are any thoughts about the origin, meaning or alternatives to  this situation, other than killing off the character who finds himself stuck therein.<br />Second, I guess the discussion of Kafka as a &quot;gay&quot; writer is fairly recent, but I'm not sure how else he  can be read.  The very lack of socio-political meanings in his work, the degree to which it is situation  based, rather than driven by ideas, leaves you with only the elements of the situation to interpret and  the point inexorably towards a conclusion that his heroes are isolated by their homosexuality.  Just  take Metamorphosis; here are the elements of the plot.  A grown single man who still lives with his  family wakes up one morning to find that he has become a bug.  This leads to his being isolated from  his shamefaced family.  His father drives him out of a room by throwing apples at him.  One lodges  in his backside and rots there; the resulting infection kills him.  Well c'mon; this just isn't even subtle.  A family ashamed of their single son.  He's a dung beetle for cripes sakes.  The apple (sin) infects his  posterior.  I mean surely we've all got the picture by now.  Why go on?<br />All of which leaves us with an interesting question, does the fact that his stories may not have meant  to him what they have come to mean to different schools of critics in some way diminish his stature as  a literary figure?  Or does the fact that his intensely personal story can be read in a universal manner  to apply to (1) the Jewish experience, (2) the epoch of totalitarian regimes and (3) the dehumanizing  age of bureaucracy in which we all live, actually demonstrate just how great a writer he was?<br />I'm inclined towards the first view.  I think that the situation that he reiterates in his work is so  specific to him and has so little to say about the world most of us live in that it is hard to justify his  lofty position in the literary pantheon.  As I read, I found myself thinking, &quot;this author is a troubled  boy&quot; more often than &quot;this is a troubling society he describes&quot;.  In a perverse way, it seems likely that  the best thing that ever happened to Kafka was the rise of totalitarian regimes in general and,  specifically, their banning of his works.  It is noteworthy that he died before the long dark night of  Nazism and Communism descended on Europe.  It is only retrospectively that his work came to be  read as a gloss on these regimes.  And had they simply ignored him, it's hard to believe that he would  have come to be so closely associated with their machinations.  Return him to the time and place that  he wrote and take his work at face value and I think you're left, not with a writer whose work defines  and illuminates the 20th Century (a la Orwell, with whom he is often unjustly paired), but with  merely the mildly intriguing tales of an unwell man.<br />GRADE: C+gloss on these regimes.

School, in this case, was Harvard Law School, back when  that still meant something.  He said that the guy had fallen on hard times and had refused repeated  offers of help, so we drove on and he went along his merry, though entirely demented, way.  Had this  occurred just a few years earlier, that bum might well have been Joe Gould, whom Joseph Mitchell  immortalized in the pages of The New Yorker.<br />Up in the Old Hotel is a collection of Mitchell's otherwise hard to find essays, in which he lovingly  describes haunts like the Fulton Fish Market and McSorley's, one of the last bars in America to admit  women, and profiles various fisherfolk and colorful denizens of New York City's nether regions, most  famously, Joe Gould, the bohemian character with whom he is inevitably and eternally linked.  Mitchell first wrote about Gould in 1942, in a piece called, Professor Sea Gull.  Mitchell's great skill  as a writer was to let his subjects seemingly speak for themselves, but to in fact render their words in  compulsively readable fashion.  This works particularly effectively with Joe Gould who was a  fountain of words anyway.  The story relates how Gould, a Harvard grad, subsists on practically no  money (one of his tricks is to make a soup out of the ketchup in restaurants), his propensity for  making a spectacle of himself as he starts flapping his arms and declaiming poetry in the &quot;language&quot;  of sea gulls, and his life's work, the nine million word Oral History of Our Time.  Within the pages of  hundreds of composition books, of the kind we used to use in school, Gould claimed to be writing a  history of the world in the form of the conversations of ordinary people as he heard them speaking  every day &quot;&quot;What people say is history.&quot;  It was this idea that beguiled Mitchell and his readers, made  Gould into a minor celebrity, and ultimately formed a tragicomic link to Mitchell's own career.<br />You see, Mitchell gradually came to suspect that Gould's magnum opus did not really exist.  When,  upon Gould's death, Mitchell went in search of the Oral History and could find only a few garbled  fragments, he decided, with some qualms, to expose the hoax that he had such played a central role in  propagating.  The result was the elegaiac Joe Gould's Secret which was written in 1964 and proved to  be the last piece Joseph Mitchell ever published.  For the next thirty years he showed up at The New  Yorker every day, went into his office and seemed to work, but never produced a word.  He became  legendary for his &quot;writer's block,&quot; a staple figure in the many novels featuring a New Yorker like  magazine, such as Bright Lights, Big City. Rumor had it that he was emulating his hero James Joyce  and writing a Ulysses-type novel set in the New York he knew so well.  But like Joe Gould, his  masterwork does not appear to have been committed to paper.<br />There are many fine essays in the book, but you really should, at least, read these two Joe Gould  profiles.  They stand as masterpieces of the journalist's art on their own, but when Mitchell's  subsequent problems are taken into account and the eerie parallels become clear, these stories become  transcendent and genuinely haunting.<br />GRADE : A+say is history.&quot;  It was this idea that beguiled Mitchell and his readers, made  Gould into a minor celebrity, and ultimately formed a tragicomic link to Mitchell's own career.<br />You see, Mitchell gradually came to suspect that Gould's magnum opus did not really exist.

Today though, I doubt whether many of us get past  about four or five of his most popular works:  A Tale of Two Cities, A Christmas Carol, David  Copperfield, Great Expectations and Oliver Twist.  At least, I know I've got about five others sitting  on a shelf collecting dust, their daunting size defeating my mild wish to have read them.  But recently  PBS ran a Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of Our Mutual Friend and it was terrific, which proved  sufficient motivation to read it too.<br />In barest outline, John Harmon is the heir to a junkman's fortune.  But his father conditioned the  inheritance on his marrying a young woman, Bella Wilfer, whom the elder Harmon had once met in  the park when she was a mere child.  Harmon rebels at the notion, for her sake as much as his own,  and when fortune presents him with the opportunity to stage his own death, he takes it.  A corpse,  later identified as Harmon, is found floating in the Thames by Gaffer Hexam and his daughter Lizzie,  whose trade it is to loot such bodies.  With John's &quot;death,&quot; the fortune reverts to Nicodemus Boffin,  who had been an assistant at the junkyard.  Boffin and his wife bring Bella to live with them, in hopes  of alleviating her disappointment at not receiving the fortune.  The avaricious Bella is indeed  determined to marry money and so has little inclination, at first, to humor the affections of John  Rokesmith, the mysterious young man (and eponymous Mutual Friend) who comes to work as  Boffin's personal assistant.<br />Meanwhile, while Gaffer Hexam has a falling out with his old partner Rogue Riderhood, Lizzie gets  her bright but selfish young brother into a school, where his teacher Bradley Headstone develops an  unhealthy love for Lizzie.  She is also being pursued by the young lawyer Eugene Wrayburn, despite  the obvious difference in their social stations.<br />While the first story line features the moral development of Bella and the growing love between her  and John Harmon/Rokesmith, the second soon degenerates....  Beyond the two basic plots, the book is completely overstuffed--with ridiculous coincidences  and impossible happenings; with characters who are little more than caricatures, some too virtuous,  some too malevolent; with subplots that peter out and go nowhere. Running it's course throughout the  story, like a liquid leitmotif, is the River Thames and brooding over it are the enormous piles of  &quot;dust,&quot; the garbage on which the Harmon fortune is founded.  It all gets to be a bit much, but it's also  really refreshing to see the great novelist at work.<br />This is what Tom Wolfe meant when he urged modern authors to get out and look around and write  about what they found, instead of penning the increasingly insular and psychological novels which  have become the staple of modern fiction.  Dickens got the idea for the body fished from the water by  seeing rivermen at work, for Charlie Hexam after seeing such a bright young boy with his father. The  &quot;dust&quot; piles were in fact a real source of wealth, in a society where the refuse of the well to do could  be used again by the poor.  If Dickens writing is ultimately too broad for us to think of the book as  realistic, it at least attempts to capture the flavor (or the stench) of a time and a place and it is  animated by the society that teemed around him.  If Dickens ultimately seems to have tried to do too  much, better a novel like this where the author's reach exceeds his grasp than to settle for one where  the author ventures little.  Sure it could stand to lose a couple hundred pages, a few subplots and a  dozen or so characters, and it's not up to the standard of his best work (there's a reason after all why  we all read the same few books) but it's great fun and, even if just to watch the steady growth of Bella  Wilfer and the steady disintegration of Bradley Headstone, well worth reading.<br />GRADE: Bo capture the flavor (or the stench) of a time and a place and it is  animated by the society that teemed around him.

These stories, which originally began appearing in  1928 in his newspaper column, are all short mysteries; but they are a unique type of mystery.  Capek  is less interested in the mechanics of the mystery story itself than in the essential mysteries of human  existence: a coded telegram makes a family doubt their daughter, a man is obsessed with footprints  that disappear in the snow, a community is wonders why a certain woman is the only one who can  find a certain type of blue flower, a stamp collection stolen in childhood is shown to have warped an  old man's life, God sits in judgment on a condemned man, and so on.  Some are really terrific, some  merely amusing, but all are interesting, albeit brief, meditations on our perceptions of the appearance  of things, how those appearances often mask a much different reality and how those perceptions shape  us.<br />To my mind, this is a collection that is best read a story at a time, much as he wrote them.  While they  are somewhat interconnected, I found that reading several in succession was less enjoyable than  savoring one a night or every couple of nights.

Narrated in the first person, it tells the story of a fatherless boy whose happy life  with his mother and their doting servant Clara Peggoty is cruelly ended when his mother remarries.  His stepfather, Mr. Murdstone, first sends him away to school (Salem House), where he is abused,  then, after David's mother dies, puts him to work gluing labels on bottles.  Eventually he runs away  and is adopted by his stern but loving aunt, Miss Betsey Trotwood.  She sends him to a better school  (Dr. Strong's) and he is launched on a career that will see him become a law clerk, a reporter and  ultimately a successful novelist.  He marries Dora, the pretty but insipid daughter of Mr. Spenlow, for  whom he clerked.  She falls ill and dies after an unsuccessful childbirth and David marries Agnes  Wickfield, who had been like a sister to him when he lived with her family while he was at Dr.  Strong's school.<br />Such is the basic outline of David's life and it is not much to look at, is it?  Nor is David a particularly  compelling character--of course, Pip, in Great Expectations, isn't either but he at least is subjected to  the demented machinations of Miss Havesham.  No, the real strength of this novel does not lie in the  narrator; it is the delicious cast of supporting characters who make this novel great.  Early in life  David is befriended by Peggoty and her wonderful brother Daniel, a fisherman raising his niece and  nephew in a converted boat on Yarmouth Sands, and Mr. Barkis, the bachelor cab driver who asks  David to inform Peggoty that: &quot;Barkis is willing&quot;.  While attending Salem House, David lives with  the family of Wilkins Micawber, grandiloquent and eternally optimistic in the face of dire financial  straights, he is always certain that something will turn up.  David's Aunt is amusing, but even better  is her friend Mr. Dick, an eccentric author who turns his voluminous masterwork into a kite.<br />Equally good are the villains of the piece.  The stepfather and his sister, Jane Murdstone, are wicked  enough for a fairy tale.  David's schoolboy chum Steerforth proves to be a colossal heel.  And there is  no more malefic figure in literature than Uriah Heep, the scheming clerk who blackmails Agnes  father, steals Betsey Trotwood's money and swears his undying enmity towards David.<br />Covering much of the same territory and offering up similar, but significantly different, characters,  Copperfield offers a more benevolent view of life than Great Expectations.  Because of this, and the  general dyspepsia of literary critics and academics, it is often taken less seriously, tarred as somewhat  lightweight.  But it is vastly entertaining and if the ending is a little too pat, our complaint is less a  function of the mechanics of the conclusion than our disappointment....

He presents the project from the viewpoints of the yuppie couple who are having  it built, the four &quot;hippie carpenters&quot; doing the building and the visionary but fidgety architect.  One of  the surprising things that emerges is the degree to which they each have their own vested interests and  those interests are often, if not always, in direct opposition to each other.  The homeowners want great  work &amp; want it cheap.  The builders want decent work and want it to pay them well.  The architect  wants the whole thing to come out the way he drew it up on paper.<br />In this case, the Souweines, the ultra-liberal lawyer/psychologist couple, are like the worst caricature  of any of those yuppie scum couples you've ever seen on This Old House.  Despite their radical views,  when it comes to getting their house built, the Souweines are just like any of the greedy money  grubbing, worker-exploiting robber barons that they despise.  Meanwhile, the builders,  Jim Locke,  Richard Gougeon, Alex Ghiselin and Ned Krutsky, whose company is known as Apple Corps, are  kind of burn outs who build for the love of it, and they prove to be no match for the predatory  Souweines.  The architect, William Rawn, just flits around in the background, trying to make sure  that the clash doesn't affect his vision for the completed house.<br />Here is Ms Souweine complaining that Jim Locke won't give his opinion on decorating issues:<br />  &quot;The builder sort of becomes the judge, and for some reason you care,&quot; she says.  She laughs. &quot;Jim  studiously avoided questions of taste during the planning.  He said&quot;--she does a gruff  voice--&quot;'That's  not my job.' That sort of very moralistic view.  We said, 'You can have an opinion, we can reject  it.'  Maybe that's why.  He didn't want it rejected.  It's safest on questions of taste not to offer an  opinion.  But it's totally alien to me.  I always give opinions that no one ever asked me for.&quot;<br />Now I ask you, would you give this shrieking harridan your opinion and, worse,  the opportunity to  give you hers.  I think not.  Kidder also points out that it's not in any builders best interest to get  involved in these matters.  First because he can alienate a client, but second because his financial  interests come into play.  More expensive alternatives often mean more profit.<br />The one criticism that I noticed in reviews (especially Christopher Lehmann-Haupt at the NY Times)  and agree with, is that Kidder is so ostentatiously not present in the form of a narrative I, that it  actually becomes distracting &amp; seems almost intellectually dishonest, since we know that people are  reacting to him or even acting out scenes for him.<br />At any rate, it all makes for an interesting and even, at times, exciting story.  If by the end we're  hoping that the house burns down the day the Souweines move in, that's not the author's fault.<br />GRADE: Bnot to offer an     opinion.  But it's totally alien to me.

He starved to death about 113 days later.  I'm not sure  there's any way to say this without sounding harsh, so I won't try, it is hard to believe that the human  gene pool wasn't strengthened by his death.<br />Jon Krakauer seems to have set himself a formidable career task--to explain to the average Joe why  people venture out into nature and do profoundly idiotic things.  I fear the task may be more than he,  or anyone else, can accomplish.  He goes to great lengths to try to render Chris McCandless sensible to  us, dismissing the notion that he was insane out of hand, comparing his own youth to Chris's  adventure, contrasting Chris to early explorers who met similar deaths, but in the end, he seems to be  arguing a losing case.  It seems likely from his behavior that Chris McCandless did have some kind of  mental illness or else he was so profoundly disrespectful of the might of the wild, that in some sense,  he deserved to die.<br />As I write this, in June of 1999, there's a young fella I work with who is heading off to Alaska with  several friends for a six week hike across a patch of wilderness that no humans may have ever  previously walked across.  He's a nice enough kid, bright (graduated from Bates &amp; when he gets back  he starts a Doctoral program at Dartmouth), sociable (he's going with friends), stable (he seems likely  to get married in August) and, most of all, realistic.  He and his friends have made thorough and  complicated preparations for this trip: they are taking everything from bear spray to antibiotics; they  are being resupplied by air in mid trip; they'll have survival beacons, etc..  In short, they recognize  that this is a hazardous venture and have taken sensible precautions to minimize the dangers.  I still  want him to make my kids the beneficiaries of his insurance policy, but I don't think he's acting out  some kind of death wish.<br />Chris McCandless' expedition stands in such stark contrast to this model, that, if he was sane, then I  for one feel he did little more than commit suicide.<br />Grade: CI still  want him to make my kids the beneficiaries of his insurance policy, but I don't think he's acting out  some kind of death wish.<br />Chris McCandless' expedition stands in such stark contrast to this model, that, if he was sane, then I  for one feel he did little more than commit suicide.<br />Grade: C	2000-10-06

I  assume this one is chosen because, while it is still great, it is one of his shorter efforts.<br />The story should be familiar, Dr. Alexander Manette is freed from his unjust imprisonment in the  Bastille and is reunited with his long lost daughter, Lucie, in England.  They are called as witnesses at  the treason trial of Charles Darnay, a dashing young Frenchman.  Darnay too is falsely accused, but he  is saved, in part by his resemblance to a law clerk named Sydney Carton.  Darnay and Lucie  eventually marry, though not before the wastrel Carton declares his love for her and his unworthiness  of her.  He pledges that one day he will prove himself worthy by doing her a service.  That  opportunity comes when Darnay is condemned to death by a French tribunal and sentenced to the  guillotine.<br />This has been one of my favorite books since the 8th Grade.  There is no more thrilling moment in  literature then when Carton takes Darnay's place and bravely faces certain death.  It is a moment of  redemption that reminds us that great literature serves human purposes; we may never have such a  moment in our own lives, but the example instructs us in how we should face such a situation if the  time comes.  We can ask no more of ourselves than the courage and sense of honor to do that &quot;far, far  better thing.&quot;<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-06

Today, however, you read an obligatory novel or two in High School, breath a sigh of relief that's  over and then blithely ignore him along with the rest of the ancients.  But, as a reacquaintance with A  Christmas Carol will remind you, he remains pretty accessible and his novels are often quite fun.  What's more, there's even a Reading Version (available online) of the story  that Dickens condensed himself for his numerous public readings of the tale.  It's perfect for reading  aloud to the family.<br />Here's just a sample of the prose to entice you:<br />On Scrooge before:  Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge. a squeezing, wrenching, grasping,  scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever  struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him  froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his  eyes  red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head,  and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with  him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.<br />and Scrooge after:  Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not  die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as  the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some  people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he  was  wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did  not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway,  he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less  attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.<br />  He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever  afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man  alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim  observed, God bless Us, Every One!<br />We, all of us, have a tendency to let the classics become so encrusted that we take them for granted  and forget how good they really are; if this has happened for you with A Christmas Carol, do yourself  a favor and dig out a copy and reread it this Holiday Season.

The resulting work, Great Expectations, was  published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861.  This was his second  semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in  middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to  happiness.  In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years.  Indeed  he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words.  Despite,  or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.<br />Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and  her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery.  One day, while visiting his parents'  gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some  &quot;wittles&quot;.  When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the  file and food before being carted back to prison.<br />Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward  Estella.  Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at  the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding  gown.  Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.<br />Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his  name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman.  Pip assumes, and Havisham  allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will  make him worthy of Estella.<br />As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing  up.  He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber.  So he is stunned when he discovers that he  is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being  transported.  Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger.  Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with  Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but  Joe redeems his debts and brings him home.  Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to  him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human  being.<br />Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together,  that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love.  But at the urging of others, he changed the ending  and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her  experiences and her wretched marriages.<br />This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers.  It has everything you could ask for  in a novel:  central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming  better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name  it, it's in here.  I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and  David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.<br />GRADE: A+in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing  up.

He's at it  again in Archangel, the premise of which is that Stalin may have left behind a secret notebook when  he died in March, 1953.<br />Once promising British historian of Soviet affairs, &quot;Fluke&quot; Kelso, is in post-Gorbachev Moscow for a  symposium on the status of the old archives of the Soviet Union.  After his speech he's approached by  an elderly Russian man who, over many drinks, tells him an amazing story.  The man, Papu Rapava,  was a very young bodyguard for Lavrenty Beria, the brutal head of the NKVD, Stalin's state security  agency.  He was on duty the night that Stalin had his fatal stroke and drove Beria to the scene, then  witnessed Beria hiding a notebook which he retrieved from Stalin's safe in the Kremlin.  Stalin was  notorious for not putting anything on paper, so when rivals toppled Beria from power, both he and  Rapava were tortured, but neither revealed the whereabouts of their find.<br />Kelso sees the notebook as a final chance to redeem his disappointing career, but his fellow historians  at the symposium think he's desperately grabbing at straws.  Soon though he's got the Russian secret  service and the shadowy remnants of the Communist Party on his tail and Rapava is murdered before  they can recover the notebook.  With the help of an American TV newsman and Rapava's daughter  Kelso sets out on a dangerous journey that will take them to the frigid woods of Archangel and to a  confrontation with Stalin's most dangerous legacy.<br />Like his other books, Harris uses the materials of actual history as a springboard for an exciting  adventure with insidious political overtones.  At one point the characters are discussing Russia's future  and suggest that it will be bleak until the nation honestly reckons with the monstrous crimes of Stalin  and Lenin.  As they point out, in present day Russia, which never had a Nuremberg Trials or a South  African-style Truth Commission, the Communist Party still receives a huge percentage of the vote in  national elections and a startling 24% of the populace considers Stalin to be the greatest leader in the  country's history.  Harris lays out the case against these butchers and, once again, the discomforting  subtext is that this is the regime that we cooperated with in WWII and then coexisted with for the next  half century.<br />During the Cold War, novelists like John Le Carre created a really unfortunate literature of moral  equivalency, which suggested that there was little or no difference between the West and the  Communist East.  That they and other  intellectuals of the Left were successful is evidenced by the morally bankrupt policy of d&eacute;tente, which  essentially represented our capitulation and an acceptance of the legitimacy of the Communists  abhorrent system of totalitarian rule. Today there's at least one author whose books demand that we  reconsider that whole period and our delusions about the Soviet Union, particularly in comparison to  Nazi Germany.  If you're looking for thrillers that, while action packed, will also make you think, you  owe it to yourself to read the books of Robert Harris.<br />GRADE : A-ion honestly reckons with the monstrous crimes of Stalin  and Lenin.

2257139:US	52173832	RVBP3D6TT69XU	0345361792	438809520	A Prayer for Owen Meany	Books	3	6	9	N	N	lightweight	Here is the opening sentence of the novel:<br />  I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice--not because of his voice, or because he  was the smallest person I ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my mother's death,  but because he is the reason I believe in God; I am a Christian because of Owen Meany.<br />Now I have to admit to not keeping up with John Irving's career, the last thing I read was Garp, but it  seems to me that this is where I left him twenty years ago.  All of the faux Christian elements are  back--virgin births, saintly mothers, neutered heroes, etc.  The narrative voice is similar; the narrator  is the weakest character.  The politics is still lightly leftish.  And so on...  Irving set out to be his  generation's Dickens, but would appear to be turning into it's Vonnegut, endlessly rewriting the same  novel under the mistaken impression that he is conveying profound truths, when in fact he is offering  up mild amusements.<br />The specific focus of this book is the type of religious manifestation or miracle that would be  necessary to make someone believe in God.  Irving quotes Frederick Buechner:<br />  Not the least of my problems is that I can hardly even imagine what kind of an experience a  genuine, self-authenticating religious experience would be. Without somehow destroying me in the  process, how could God reveal himself in a way that would leave no room for doubt? If there were  no room for doubt, there would be no room for me.<br />The narrator of the story, Johnny Wheelwright, finds his revelatory experience in the life &amp;  martyrdom of his boyhood friend Owen Meany, a dwarf who speaks in a high pitched but stentorian  voice, which Irving renders, to the reader's profound annoyance, in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.  He  has several visions and dreams which convince him that he is predestined to save a flock of  Vietnamese children.  The book wends along for some 500 pages to this inevitable conclusion, with  myriad stops for Irving's confused political ravings and introduction of bizarre but pointless  supporting characters.  It is a mark of the author's ability to please his audience and the inherent  drama in the fate of Meany that we are swept along, reasonably willingly, to this conclusion.  It is the  essence of his weakness that we finish the book thinking, not about what it all meant, but that, thanks  to a few well-handled set pieces, it would make a decent slapstick comedy for the movies.<br />For when we step back from the tale for just a moment, we quickly see that the whole thing is a  triumph of form over substance.  Irving is fascinated by the trappings and structures of Christianity (it  occured to me, as I skipped to Owen's speeches, that putting his words in block letters recalled the Red  Letter Bibles, which put Christ's words in red), but he apparently has no interest in the import of  Christian beliefs, nor any understanding of faith.  The Gospels are vibrant documents today, not  because of the arc of the story they tell, but because of the message of brotherly love and human  redemption that Christ brought with him.  Irving preaches little more than that the Vietnam War was,  and America is, a mess.  It's not exactly analogous to The Sermon on the Mount.<br />As to his obsession with miracles, the whole thing strikes me as utterly obtuse.  The future that Meany  foresaw for himself came to pass, so Wheelwright believes in God?  Bill Clinton knew he'd be  President one day, has his convinced anyone of the existence of a divine being?  When Frederick  Buechner wrote the passage that is quoted above, could he not see that his existence and his ability to  convey his thoughts are a miracle entire?  He and Irving really seem to be looking for magic tricks,  not for miracles, because the miracle is all around them.<br />Meanwhile, Owen Meany continually acts in the book so as to conform with his visions.  He seems to  have abdicated that which makes us human, free will.  If Irving's understanding of Christianity is  really this meager, it's hard to see how he could ever have much of value to convey to us.<br />What we end up with here is a reasonably amusing book, which is only a simulacrum of a story of  religious belief.  If you do not approach it expecting anything more than a pleasant diversion, you'll  not be disappointed.  If you expect to be enlightened, look elsewhere.<br />GRADE: Cmakes us human, free will.

Junger tells the exciting story of those who faced the fury of that storm  at sea and of the men who tried to rescue them.<br />The book is genuinely thrilling, as the reader gets caught up in the various survival struggles and  rescue attempts. Throughout the book, Junger regales us with tales of storms past &amp; explains the  physics of the storm &amp; the Sea. All of this is wonderful.<br />However, I have one major complaint with the structure of the book. He has built the story around the  Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat out of Gloucester, MA, &amp; her crew of six. But as he tells us in the  opening section of the book, the crewman are basically drunken louts who work the boats because  those are the jobs available to them. They go to sea to make enough money to fuel the lives of  dissipation they lead ashore. They just aren't very interesting people.<br />Moreover, the Andrea Gail, as we know early on, was lost with all hands, so Junger is forced to  imagine what may have happened to them. This leads to an abundance of &quot;they must&quot;s &amp;  &quot;inevitably&quot;s &amp; &quot;one imagine&quot;s. It's pretty unsatisfactory.<br />Meanwhile, the pararescue jumpers (rescue divers) &amp; the Coast Guard &amp; Navy helicopter crews are  genuinely fascinating. Their dedication to their dangerous work is wondrous to behold and their feats  of heroism are amazing. Yet they are shunted to the side in the book &amp; we are left wanting to know  more about them &amp; their work.<br />Now I know that other folks I've talked to have not been much bothered by this &amp; I still enjoyed the  book very much, so I wouldn't let this criticism deter you from reading it.

Sadly, no one was listening.<br />Ethan Allen Hawley is a Harvard educated descendent of New England shipping captains.  In years  past, his family was one of the most important in town.  But now times have changed &amp; after his  father lost most of the family fortune &amp; Ethan himself lost the family store, he is reduced to being a  grocery clerk in the employ of an immigrant, Mr. Marullo.<br />Ethan's wife, Mary, and his two children, Ellen and Allen, push him to better the family's lot. Mary,  for instance, wants him to invest the $6000 she inherited upon her brother's death.<br />The town vixen, Margie Young-Hunt, provides a powerful pull to kick over the traces &amp; run a bit  wild.  She sends a representative from a food wholesaler to Ethan &amp; he is offered a kickback if he'll  buy from them.<br />Meanwhile, Danny Taylor, his childhood friend &amp; now the town drunk, holds a piece of property that  developers are desparate to get ahold of for their planned airport.  The local banker approaches Ethan  for help in getting the property away from Danny.<br />In short order Ethan is narcing on neighbors, betraying Danny, taking bribes &amp; planning to rob the  bank.<br />The ease with which the morally upright Ethan slips into a life of scheming and crime is not  particularly believable.  And I'll leave it to others to question the likelihood of a college graduate  turned grocery clerk (lawyer/technicians shouldn't throw stones.)<br />However, Steinbeck had clearly perceived the general decline in morality that was occuring and  accelerating as the nation entered the 1960's.  As Ethan considers his schemes, he says, &quot;A crime is  something someone else commits&quot;.  Here's his description of the year 1960: it was &quot;a year when secret  fears come into the open, when discontent stops being dormant and changes gradually to anger.  The  whole world stirred with restlessness and uneasiness as discontent moved to anger and anger tried to  find outlet in action, any action so long as it is violent.&quot;<br />Steinbeck manages to paint an extremely bleak portrait of America &amp; where it was headed, but it's  hard to argue that he was wrong.  He offers only two rays of hope.  At one point, Ethan recalls the  words of his grandfather, &quot;Only in a single man alone--only in one man alone.  There's the only  power--one man alone.  Can't depend on anything else.&quot;  This nearly biblical incantation offers the way out of the predicament that Steinbeck has forecast.  Each man must take responsibility for his  own actions.<br />Then when Ethan has reached the end of his rope &amp; considers suicide, a simple action by his daughter  draws him back from the edge &amp; he determines that he must try to help her, &quot;else another light go  out.&quot;  I found this to be somewhat too little too late, especially as his daughter has already gotten up  to no good.<br />I did find one thing remarkable about the book.  Steinbeck may well have been the last of the  significant traditional novelists.  It is such a pleasure to read a straightforward story that doesn't resort  to magical realism or interior monologue or other modernistic artifice.  At one point, Ethan says, &quot;A  man who tells secrets or stories must think of who is hearing or reading, for a story has as many  versions as it has readers.  Everyone takes what he wants or can from it and thus changes it to his  measure.  Some pick out parts and reject the rest, some strain the story through their mesh of  predjudice, some paint it with their own delight.  A story must have some points of contact with the  reader to make him feel at home in it.  Only then can he accept wonders.&quot;  Compare this to The Way  of All Flesh, where Samuel Butler stated that he didn't care if anyone ever read his books or to James  Joyce's completely inaccessible works.<br />It seems to me that this novel may stand as the demarcation of the end of a moral and a stylistic era.<br />GRADE:  Bems to me that this novel may stand as the demarcation of the end of a moral and a stylistic era.<br />GRADE:  B	2000-10-06

And  while the sensation they created may not have been nearly so frantic nor universal in those blessed  premedia days, the fanaticism that they engendered was no less powerful.  Our neighbor Mark Farris  used to just start one series and read it, then start the other and read it and then start all over again.  I  wasn't quite that bad, but I do recall that one of the proudest accomplishments of my young life was  actually completing both series, a feat that involved reading several thousand pages.<br />Now, I'm certain that most of the metaphorical and allegorical nuances of these books completely  escaped most of us at these early readings.  But these books, along with comic books and pulp novels  like Doc Savage and The Avenger, served one vital function, they demonstrated with incontrovertible  certitude that there were such things as good and evil and that it was better to be good.  Such books  are often termed escapist fantasy and, for me at least, that was precisely their attraction; the  opportunity that they offered, to escape from the disturbing moral relativism of the 60's and 70's, and  enter worlds where the truths, that I sensed to be eternal and absolute, actually obtained.  As much as  parents or religion, it was books like these that formed the template from which our inchoate sense of  morality was forged.<br />It must be true for most children that the arts and literature to which they are exposed when young,  will have a decisive impact on their moral development.  That is why the culture of video games,  Goosebump books, politically correct twaddle like Billy has Two Mommies and the vast wasteland of  Television are so pernicious and why the emergence of Harry Potter is such a hopeful sign.  First for  the bad, take as an example the first-person-shooter games like Doom.  What precisely do such games  teach children?  There is no narrative line to these games.  They are not pretending to be heroes; the  only goal is to kill others and to survive yourself.  For all you know, you may be the bad guy.  Is it  any surprise that a generation that is being raised on these games produces children with no sense of  right and wrong, children capable of blowing away classmates as if they were extensions of the game?<br />Harry Potter, on the other hand, offers a glimmer of hope.  The astronomical sales and popularity of  the series must surely be an indicator that kids still long to escape into a world where right and wrong  and good and evil are clearly defined and easily comprehensible.  Hopefully parents are exploiting this  phenomena and turning their kids on to books in general and specifically this genre.  This is a golden  moment we've been handed, a once in a generation chance to pry kids out from in front of the TV and  the PC and get them reading.  Let's hope it's not wasted.<br />Kids who like Harry Potter would certainly like the Chronicles of Narnia. But the secret charm of the  Narnia books is that when you return to them as an older reader you begin to perceive a whole new  layer of meaning in the texts.  For Lewis, one of the great Christian apologists of the Century,  essentially rendered Christian myth in the guise of children's fantasy.  With a more mature eye, we  realize what it means that the children enter a world where it is &quot;always Winter, but Christmas never  comes&quot;, that the great lion Aslan is Christ, the White Witch is Satan, her defeat of Aslan is a  reenactment of the Crucifixion and, of course, when Aslan rises again to lead the humans and defeat  the Witch, it symbolizes the risen Christ leading us in battle against evil.  If not exactly subtle, these  lessons are at least not heavy handed and should not deter anyone from reading the books.<br />If you've got a kid who is devouring the Harry Potter books, don't let them stop there.  Turn them  towards this classic series and then to Tolkein.  With any luck they'll discover the same sense of  wonder and enjoyment that preceding generations have found and maybe even shut off the TV in  order to read once in a while.<br />GRADE: A+kein.

The book was plausible and very exciting,  but best of all it confronted readers with the similarity between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union  and implicitly asked why the west fought one and aided the other.  Now, in Enigma, he shows that he  can work equally effectively against the backdrop of actual events and still broach big ideas.<br />It's February, 1943 and Tom Jericho, a brilliant young Cambridge mathematician and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Alan  Turing, has already suffered one nervous breakdown under the pressure of working to break secret  Nazi codes.  Now he's summoned back to Bletchley Park because the U-boat code, known as Shark,  which was previously decrypted due to an epiphany of his, has suddenly been changed just as an  enormous supply convoy from America is setting out for Britain.  Despite his delicate mental state, it's  felt that he'll be valuable just for his totemic value and to reassure the higher-ups that all the best men  are working on the problem.<br />Complicating matters is the disappearance of Jericho's ex-girlfriend, Claire Romilly, who it appears  may have tipped off the Germans that their codes had been cracked.  At any rate, some must have  betrayed this vital secret, and, even as the supply convoy sails towards one of the biggest U-boat  wolfpacks ever assembled, Jericho sets out to discover who the traitor is and where Claire has  disappeared too.<br />The author too manages a difficult feat as he balances the mystery plot with healthy dollops of WWII  history and cryptographic technique.  Jericho's quest for Claire is exciting enough, but it's the details  about the Enigma machines, which produced what the Nazis believed to be an unbreakable codes, and  the British success in breaking them anyway, which really make for fascinating reading.  Then, as if  that weren't enough, when Harris introduces the reason that someone at Bletchley would assist the  Nazis, he returns to some of the troubling moral and geopolitical questions that he first raised in  Fatherland.  It all makes for a thoughtful thriller that entertains, enlightens and provokes the reader.<br />GRADE : A-which really make for fascinating reading.

Several factors contributed to this phenomenon.  First, there was the general feeling (hope) on  the Left that the U.S. was in decline, perhaps best expressed in Paul Kennedy's best-selling Rise and  Fall of the Great Powers.  Second was the fact that Japan's centrally planned  economy appealed to many on the Left, who hoped to see the U. S. adopt a similar system.  Third,  let's face it, was a persistent strain of anti-Asian racism in American society.  Though Germany and  Japan shared many qualities in the late 80's, it was Japan's rise in particular which was greeted  hysterically.  It is no coincidence that while German immigrants faced a significant degree of ethnic  animosity during WWI, though little or none during WWII, it was Japanese-Americans who were  actually rounded up and put in concentration camps after Pearl Harbor was bombed.  Oddly enough,  despite the American Left's generally impressive record on racial matters, both the internments of  WWII and the outbreak of Japanophobia in the late 80's were led by the Left.  I can't explain this  blind spot, but it's interesting to note that it persists in the diametrically different ways in which the  Left today treats Castro's Cuba as opposed to Red China, the last two remaining outposts of  communism, advocating a lifting of sanctions on Cuba, while seeking to deny China a range of Free  Trade opportunities.  At any rate, whatever it's causes, it was less than a decade ago that intellectuals,  academics and politicians joined together to proclaim that Japan was the next superpower and that  America would be left in her wake.<br />Today, with the American economy in the best shape that any economy has ever been in and Japan's  economy a complete mess, these doomsday predictions can correctly be seen as ridiculous.  But even  at the time they were being made, calmer heads perceived the endemic weaknesses confronting Japan.  The best book from the period was Bill Emmott's The Sun Also Sets, in which he pointed out many  problems with Japan's economic system.  Having not read the book in many years, I don't recall  whether all of the following come from his discussion of the issues, but problems included  :<br />  (1) Lack of natural resources<br />  (2) Lack of a military<br />  (3) Low birth rate and aging population<br />  (4) Hostility towards immigrants<br />all of which are pretty self evident.  But more significant were the factors which were conventionally  perceived as strengths which properly understood were really weaknesses:<br />  (5) Japan's high rate of personal savings, though understood to reflect frugality, actually derived  from the complete absence of other outlets for consumers.  With no opportunity to buy a home and  no need for a car, the citizenry had nothing else to do with their money but to put it into low-yield  savings accounts.<br />  (6) Extensive trade barriers, which on an artificial level seemed to protect Japanese industries,  actually stifled competition and drove up prices for domestic consumers.<br />  (7) The homogenous population and practically one-party government, which were thought to  provide stability and societal cohesion, predictably lead to stasis, insularity, and corruption.<br />  (8) The conformity and obedience which made for such a good workforce also made for a  supremely unimaginative people.  Japan became an economic force by manufacturing high quality  products cheaply, but the products themselves were invented elsewhere, mostly here.  This was  double trouble because there were several other nations (Korea, Taiwan, etc.) with equally  disciplined labor corps, capable of meeting the same quality standards, and willing to work for  lower wages.  But more importantly, as the world economy moved from the old heavymanufacturing model towards one based on intellectual capital, Japan found itself unable to  compete.<br />  (9) and, of course, centralized planning, as is recognized by all except intellectuals, is so inefficient that it is almost entirely unresponsive  to  any changing circumstances, but especially to such an enormous paradigm shift.  If no one, or very  few, even recognize or understand what's going on in the economy, how are a few bureaucrats  supposed to intelligently direct the economy.<br />These factors all combined to make it obvious to anyone who was not caught up in the mania of the  moment that and was not ideologically committed to authoritarian government, that, far from being  the next dominant world power, Japan was headed for a precipitous decline.  All of which brings us to  another trend-sucking bestseller by Michael Crichton.<br />Rising Sun is an interesting mystery, a fascinating clash of cultures, and a completely over-the-top  anti-Japan polemic--kind of like Robert Ludlum interspersed with the Protocols of the Elders of  Zion.  As the detectives pursue their murder investigation, characters launch into extended  disquisitions on the cunning and the treacherous business practices of the Japanese.  As a result,  a  competent techno-thriller ends up being buried in so much pedantry, and what's worse, inaccurate  pedantry, that the most compelling reason to read it now is that it serves as a reasonably entertaining  proof of one of our central tenets here at Brothers Judd : the accepted wisdom is always wrong.

Too bad, this is a story I  would have loved to have someone read to me when I was a kid and which I look forward to reading to  my own kids.  It is the magical, mysterious tale of young Master Toseland, who goes to spend the  Christmas holiday with his great-grandmother Mrs. Oldknow at the family estate of Green Noah.  Arriving by train, he finds the grounds flooded and the groundskeeper, Mr. Boggis, must pick him up  in a rowboat to carry him to the house.  It gradually becomes apparent that the house is temporally as  well as physically isolated.  First through overheard giggles and then by shadowy glimpses, it is  revealed to Tolly (as Mrs. Oldknow calls him) that the house is inhabited by the spirits of children  from generations long passed.  In particular, Toby, Linnet and Alexander, three siblings felled by the  plague hundreds of years earlier, romp about the building and grounds.  Mrs Oldknow, who is well  aware of the phenomena, tells Tolly stories about the children and the history of the manor, including a  gypsy curse that was placed on a creepy topiary of Noah, which is how the place (originally Green  Knowe) got its name.<br />Lucy Boston was inspired to write these books--this is the first in a series of eight--after restoring the  Manor House at Hemingford Grey, which dates to the year 1130.

Bernays and the Birth of Public Relations	Books	3	6	9	N	N	episodic but interesting	Larry Tye tells the fascinating story of Eddy Bernays, one of the major figures in the development of  modern Public Relations.  Bernays was a nephew of Sigmund Freud and much of his business was  based on appealing to peoples psychology.  He made the following analogy:  Public relations isn't like  pool, you're not trying to put the ball into the pocket, it's like billiards, you're trying to bank the ball  off of a couple rails.<br />When tobacco companies realized that the social taboo against women smoking in public was costing  them half their business they turned to Bernays.  He had a parade of women march down a New York  City avenue bearing their &quot;torches of freedom&quot; &amp; soon the taboo was gone.  When the changing pace  of life started to cut into bacon consumption, folks weren't taking the time to eat breakfast, Bernays got  doctors &amp; public health groups to make public pronouncements about the importance of breakfast &amp;  soon bacon &amp; eggs were back in force.  And when Ivory soap couldn't appeal to kids, bernays started  soap carving contests &amp; soon millions of kids were carving millions of bars of ivory soap.<br />All of these stories and gimmicks make for interesting reading, but even Tye seems to be ambivalent  about their effectiveness.  Was it parades or massive social forces that broke the cigarette taboo for  women?  Did kids actually use Ivory or just carve a bar of it &amp; lose interest?<br />The interesting question he raises is, what was Bernays social responsibilty for his campaigns &amp;  methods?  Doesn't he bear some moral culpability for encouraging smoking, cholestorol, etc?  &amp; what  of Joseph Goebbels praise for Bernays methods?  What does it say that the Nazis approved of his  methods? Tye asks all of these questions, but he doesn't really take a strong stand in answering them.<br />A more important problem with the book is it's narrative structure.  Each chapter basically consists of  Tye's reporting on a discreet topic, so it reads like a series of stories on Bernays &amp; Tobacco, Bernays &amp;  Freud, etc..  It makes the book pretty choppy.<br />All in all though, Tye's story of Bernays' career casts an interesting light on many episodes and issues  of the past century &amp; it's amazing how pertinent Bernays' methods are in this Age of Spin.<br />GRADE: B-discreet topic, so it reads like a series of stories on Bernays &amp; Tobacco, Bernays &amp;  Freud, etc..

If I told you that I've just read an excellent biographical memoir about an American original where the  author is a looming presence and sections of the book, which masquerade as primary resource material,  are actually fabricated by the biographer, you would probably assume that I'd broken down and bought  the Edmund Morris book, Dutch.  In fact, Witold Rybczynski's biography of the great American  landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), includes imagined thoughts and dialogue that  the author himself crafted.  As he told Brian Lamb on Booknotes, he doesn't much like docudramas but  found the technique could be valuable.  Indeed, the author is a character in the book, sharing his  opinions and walking through Olmsted's parks, sharing his observations.<br />I mention this, not because it takes away from the book, but because they are fairly typical techniques.  Actually, the biographer is a presence in virtually every biography, starting with the choice of whom to  write about, but then continuing with the editorial judgments about how to play incidents and what to  put in and leave out.  If authors like Morris and Rybczynski are more open about it than most, more  power to them.<br />Meanwhile, Rybczynski's subject here, in addition to designing and building Central Park, Prospect  Park, etc., was also a sailor, farmer, journalist, founder of The Nation, author of several still pertinent  books on the functioning of slavery in the South, and remained throughout his life an honest and  honorable public servant.  The author tells his story well and offers one important theme of Olmsted's  work that retains its relevance.  Olmsted, whom we perceive as a naturalist and environmentalist,  believed that wilderness, open spaces and nature itself should serve humans.  We look on Central Park  today and mistaken think of it as a preserved piece of nature in the midst of development.  Actually,  the only part of the Park that remains unchanged may be the granite outcroppings that helped make the  land cheap.  He truly built parks and he did so in order that they might serve as restorative or  recuperative sanctuaries for modern man.<br />This is a very interesting book and it is particularly useful as a counter balance to Robert Caro's great  biography of Robert Moses (The Power Broker : Robert Moses and the Fall of New York).  Caro  makes a pretty convincing case that Moses ended up using his enormous powers to impose his own will  on the geography of New York, regardless of the impact on the human beings living there.  Olmsted,  on the other hand,  remained reticent about using his power and always built with the ultimate users in  mind.  He emerges as a great American visionary and a really admirable figure.<br />GRADE: A-ranite outcroppings that helped make the  land cheap.

Here he takes what I  understand are two very minor characters from the quartet, Colonel Tusker Smalley and his  long-suffering wife Lucy, and makes their story the centerpiece of a sweetly elegiac comic novel.<br />The year is 1972 and the Smalleys have stayed on in Pankot, India even after Independence in 1947,  less out of love of the country or it's people, than out of financial need and sheer spite on Tusker's  part.  Where the upper class Brits were able to just scamper home, the Smalleys represent the folk of  the middle class, who felt that they had invested something in the colony and now deserved to get  something out of it.  As he explains to Lucy:<br />  I know for years you've thought I was a damn' fool to have stayed on, but I was forty-six when  Independence came, which is bloody early in life for a man to retire but too old to start afresh  somewhere you don't know.  I didn't fancy my chances back home, at that age, and I knew the  pension would go further in India than in England.  I still think we were right to stay on, though I  don't think of it any longer as staying on , but just as hanging on, which people of our age and  upbringing and limited talents, people who have never been really poor but never had any real  money, never inherited money, never made real money, have to do, wherever they happen to be,  when they can't work anymore.  I'm happier hanging on in India, not for India as India but because  I just can't merely think of it as a place where I drew my pay for 25 years of my working life,  which is a hell of a long time anyway, though by rights it should have been longer.<br />But now, with Tusker's health in decline, Lucy has increasing concerns about her own future.  As is,  they have led a pretty precarious existence for the past 15 years, having been reduced to living in a  hotel, the new owner of which is a ghastly Indian woman, who married the manager, Mr. Bhoolabhoy,  one of Tusker's few remaining friends.  The author etches a finely detailed portrait of his characters  and in particular of the difficult marriage of the Smalleys.  Tusker is an irascible curmudgeon straight  out of an old British barracks.  Lucy has been disappointed that their relationship did not fulfill her  romantic ideals.  These strains are exacerbated by the daily indignities they must now suffer as the last  seedy remnants of the departed British Empire, looked down upon by the very natives they once lorded  it over.  In the final scenes of the novel, two letters are written which will change these peoples' lives,  for better and for worse.<br />This is a very funny and ultimately a deeply moving story.  The Smalleys are a couple the reader won't  soon forget.  I liked it so much, I think I may finally heft that colossal Quartet off of the shelf and give  it a go.<br />GRADE: A-r the past 15 years, having been reduced to living in a  hotel, the new owner of which is a ghastly Indian woman, who married the manager, Mr. Bhoolabhoy,  one of Tusker's few remaining friends.

Rowling's Harry Potter books, the first two are both in the Top 10 of  most Bestseller Lists, lead me to reread this Children's Classic, which was one of the big favorites of  our generation.  I must have read it around fifth grade--I imagine most every kid in America reads it at  some point--and noone will be surprised to hear, it turns out I wasn't as smart as I thought I was when I  was ten.   Madeleine L'Engle managed to hoodwink me, but good.  I thought this was just a great  Science Fiction/Fantasy story, but now I discover that the whole book is a religious allegory.<br />Meg Murry and her brothers, Charles Wallace and the twins, live with their mother.  Their Father has  been missing for years, supposedly working on a top secret government project.  Meg and Charles  Wallace are strange children, noone seems to know quite whether they are idiots or geniuses.  In short  order they meet Calvin, a tall gangly boy, who also feels like a misfit and three women who have  moved into an abandoned house in the neighborhood.  The old women, Mrs. Whatsit , Mrs. Which &amp;  Mrs. Who, inform the children that Mr. Murry is in dire straits and needs their help.  They travel  through time and space via wrinkles, called tesseracts, to the planet Camazotz, where Mr. Murry has  gone to battle the forces of darkness that are closing sections of the universe in shadow.  There they  battle the evil being known as IT, a disembodied brain who offers people complete security if they will  only give up their freedom and their individuality, as have the inhabitants of Camazotz.<br />Most of the allegorical stuff is easy enough to see, the children can fight evil by finding The Father.   Meg despairs that evil is allowed to exist at all and blames her father, and so on.  But I really liked the  fact that L'Engle portrays Camazotz (or Hell) as a place where there is complete conformity and  security, but no personal freedom.  Personally, I believe that Camazotz closely resembles both a  Socialist or Communist State and the Garden of Eden. Just as the great struggle of Ms L &quot;Engle's time  was the fight for freedom against the security of Socialism/Communism, Man chose to leave the  security of a pastoral existence in the Garden and accept the vicissitudes of life without because we  prefer freedom.<br />The book also contains one of the most beautiful descriptions of human life that I've ever heard.  Mrs.  Whatsit compares life to a sonnet:<br />    It is a very strict form of poetry is it not?<br />    There are fourteen lines, I believe, all in iambic pentameter.  That's a very strict rhythm or meter,     yes?<br />    And each line has to end with a rigid rhyme pattern.  And if the poet does not do it exactly this way,     it is not a sonnet, is it?<br />    Calvin:  You mean you're comparing our lives to a sonnet?  A strict form, but freedom within it?<br />    Yes.  You're given the form, but you have to write the sonnet yourself.  What you say is     completely up to you.<br />This book conveys a worthwhile religiopolitical lesson about the human condition and is great fun  besides.  I look forward to reading it with my kids.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-01

I  brought it home &amp; showed my wife and she said: &quot;I can't believe you got that book, it's so sad&quot;.  I'll  admit I may have scoffed a little. Then I read it and darn near found my eyes growing moist.  I just felt  so sorry for the tree that I wanted to pistol whip that selfish, acquisitive kid/man. Which brings us to  the question:  Is it possible that this slender children's book is one of the most insightful comments ever  written on the &quot;Me&quot; generation?<br />This may strike you as absurd, but take a look at the First Things Symopsium about the book which can be  found online.  For my own part, I read the book as a tragedy, and despite my initial reaction, the  boy/man strikes me as the tragic figure.  He is completely consumed by selfish concerns and what he  can get from the tree.  The story could equally well be called The Taking Boy.  And in the twilight of  his life, what does he have left after taking and taking and taking?  Nothing.  In fact, he has to return to  the tree and ask for more.  The final scene seems less of a &quot;reconciliation&quot; than one more desperate act  of selfish consumption on his part.  It reminded me of Citizen Kane, with Charles Foster Kane looking  back at his life from his death bed and realizing how unfulfilled he is.<br />Silverstein was just a tad older than the Baby Boomers, but his status as a pop icon rested on their  enthusiasm.  So it's ironic that they made him a best-selling author by blindly reading this truly  devastating critique of their cohort and their lifestyle to their kids.

We needn't rehearse the elements of the story in detail because virtually every English speaking  youth on the planet reads it in school.  Just to jog your memory, Silas Marner is a devoutly religious  weaver who is unjustly accused of theft.  He moves to Raveloe where he becomes fairly reclusive both  because he wishes it so and because the villagers find him odd.  He devotes himself to the accumulation  of wealth, but is once again devastated, this time when he is the victim of theft.  Ultimately he is  redeemed by a young girl who wanders up to his door.  He raises the child and they come to love one  another as Father and Daughter.  The lesson being that neither religious fanaticism nor the love of  filthy lucre will suffice to save a man's soul, but the basic love between two humans will do the trick.<br />It's a fairly simple and straightforward story about the capacity of love to heal spiritual wounds and  make damaged beings whole, hence its power.  Her other novels are in vogue right now, particularly  the unreadable Middlemarch, but this is clearly Eliot's best and one of the most affecting novels of the  19th Century.<br />GRADE: A	2000-10-01

However, to my very pleasant  surprise, the book is terrific, combining an Iberian travelogue with delightful tales and legends of  Moorish Spain.  Irving's travels are interesting enough in themselves, but it is the tales, which have  everything from flying carpets to hidden treasure, that really make the book.<br />GRADE: A	2000-10-01

Much confusion  surrounds the interpretation of Twain's story, mostly because of the presence of Jim, who was one of  the first multi-dimensional black characters in all of fiction.  There has been a resulting tendency to  grant him primacy of place in analysis of the novel and to read it as a statement, pro or con, about  Slavery.  This is really not the appropriate way to understand the story.  Jim is obviously vital, but his  story is secondary, or at least only complimentary, to that of Huck himself.  For our purposes, we'll try  looking at the novel as if Huck was the central character, which of course he is, a fact which would  apparently surprise most modern critics.<br />Approached in this way, we can see that, far from being an aberrational instant of a major popular  author tackling the race question, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn instead falls directly into the  mainstream of American Literature, with clear antecedents in The Last of the Mohicans and Moby Dick  and obvious successors in everything from the Western to the hard-boiled detective story and most  directly in works like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Cool Hand Luke.  If  we look at just the novels named above, we find that they all share the same central  theme--dissatisfaction with the secure but restrictive clutches of &quot;civilization&quot; and the desire for  freedom.  Each of them is about men who have escaped or are trying to escape from some form of civil  society, from some system that denies them liberty.<br />This is particularly important in the case of Huck Finn because, while academics view it strictly  through the lens of Jim's escape from Slavery, the core of the novel is Huck's dash for freedom.  Indeed, while Twain is often criticized for the elaborate scheme that Tom and Huck develop to free Jim  at the end of the novel--criticized because it turns his state of slavery into a joke and a source of  amusement for the boys--the critics miss the point that it is Huck who ultimately ends up reenslaved.  This is why the story concludes with his famous vow:<br />  I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to  adopt me and sivilize me and I can't stand it.  I been there before.<br />I think you've got to grant Twain the benefit of the doubt here and assume that he was not merely  setting up a sequel.  Presumably we can take this statement seriously and it would appear to reveal the  entire point of the book--Huckleberry Finn views the formal structures of civilization as intolerable.  It  is in this sense that the book fits into the continuum of our Literature and of our politics and gives it a  valid claim to being one of the great American novels.<br />Before we go, a couple of other similarities in these books deserve mention.  One conspicuous shared  aspect of these novels is that they are all specifically about men.  Women appear only as oppressors or  figures of idolatry.  I believe this is a function of the concrete  difference in the political philosophies of the two genders--men tend to favor freedom and the risk it  entails, while women most often opt for security even at the cost of surrendering liberty.  Even if you  disagree with this theory, which would put you in good company, it is certainly true that the central  story line of all of these books involves the heroes moving away from more secure settings into riskier  but freer environments.<br />The other noticeable similarity of the stories is the frequent presence of the &quot;noble savage&quot; character.  Whether it be Chingachgook or Queequeg or Jim or The Chief, they represent man in the state of  nature, unsullied by the dandifying influences of civilization.  They are nearly aspirational figures,  archetypes brought along in order to show the hero what he could be like if he succeeds in freeing  himself.  This is a curious residue of the idyllic beliefs of men like Jean-Jacque Rousseau and Thomas  Jefferson.  I won't take the time here to discuss this fully; I merely note that the theme recurs and point  out that the idea that primitive man was somehow more free than modern man is asinine.  Hobbes had  it right when he referred to life in the state of nature as &quot;nasty, brutish and short.&quot;<br />From the foregoing analysis, it may seem to some folks that I am trying to diminish Jim's stature or  deny Twain's originality; this is not the case.  Instead, I am suggesting that in mankind's long and  schizoid struggle between Freedom and Security, America is the place, more than any other, which has  sought to vindicate the cause of Freedom.  It is natural, therefore, that our very best literature draws  upon these ideas. Huckleberry Finn has many flaws--it is overlong; it has really jarring changes in tone;  at times it is merely cruel when trying to be funny; and for the modern reader, the portrayal of Jim is  quite disconcerting, so condescending as to make us uncomfortable--but it is above all else a  quintessentially American novel and Huck is an archetypal American figure.  As a nation, we represent  the ideal of &quot;lighting out for the Territory&quot;, of providing captive peoples with freedom and  opportunity.  It is in this context that, regardless of its shortcomings, Huckleberry Finn must be  reckoned a central text in the American Canon.<br />GRADE: A-o show the hero what he could be like if he succeeds in freeing  himself.

First off, I think Ms Roy has very nearly struck the perfect  balance between the traditional English that Indians, raised on Dickens and Trollope and company, had  imposed on them and the sing song pidgin rhythms of India, which Rushdie has rendered so  annoyingly.  At times the repetitions and sentence fragments and other affectations become more of a  hindrance than a benefit, but it seems that some Indian writers feel compelled to write in this sort of  native style, and if it is inevitable, then better Roy's fairly controlled method than Rushdie's  incomprehensible over-the-top method.<br />And I did enjoy the book to a degree.  The story of two twins who are separated for some mysterious  reason at an early age, with one of them falling completely silent, is handled almost like a mystery.  The story has a real narrative drive as the history of and reasons for these events unfolds.  But I've got  to admit, whatever the controversial politics of the novel are, they went right over my head.  I'm sure it  has to do with Imperialism, Marxism, Socialism, Christianity, Hinduism, etc., because they are all  mentioned a lot.  But I truthfully couldn't discern the deeper political messages of the novelist.  Perhaps  they are too parochial?<br />And when the book's mysteries are finally revealed, I just didn't think that the dark secrets at the heart  of the novel were of sufficient import to justify the portentous build up that they were given.  Then  again, I'm a chauvinist, xenophobic, insensitive jerk, so I'm willing to assume that part of the blame is  mine.  I certainly look forward to Ms Roy's subsequent efforts.<br />Grade: C+	2000-10-01

The trainees are portrayed at a moment in life before they are truly sexualized  and when many girls can probably whip most boys butts.

The  story starts in Haiti where twelve year old Sophie has been raised by her aunt, Tante Atie, while her  mother supports the family with a job in New York.  But now her mother wants Sophie to come and  join her.  There's a beautifully detailed portrait of country life in Haiti here and the separation of  Sophie and Atie is genuinely heart rending.<br />The next section details the tentative first steps of Sophie and her mother as they feel out the  parameters of a mother-daughter relationship.  This is complicated by the fact that Sophie was the  product of her mother being raped as a teenager by a Tonton Macout.<br />This transition from Haiti to New York is fine and would be a solid basis for a novel, but Danticat now  starts skipping forward in large chunks of time.  Suddenly, Sophie is 18 and enamored of an older  neighbor who is a musician.  Her scandalized mother begins to probe her nightly to establish that she  has maintained her virginity.  Tempers explode and we skip ahead again.  Sophie has married the  musician and had a child, but she's estranged from her mother, has developed sexual phobias and has  fled to Haiti with her child.  From here the novel descends into all the worst topicality of the 90's and  we see how it made Oprah's Book Club.  We're immersed in bulimia, sexual dysfunction, female  genital mutilation, therapy, suicide, etc.<br />Ultimately,  after a strong and promising beginning, I have to say that the author lost me.  I appreciated  the opportunity to be exposed to a side of Haitian life that we rarely see, but then we're buried in a  blizzard of psychoblither.  I expect to see better from this author in the future.<br />GRADE: C-	2000-10-01

Starting with Inside Europe in 1936, Gunther,  who was one of the premier foreign  correspondents of his day, cranked out a series of voluminous (900 pages) books about the peoples,  politics, economies, etc. of each of the continents.  I finally grabbed a couple and read them and though  they are obviously quite dated, they stand up nicely as frozen moments in world history, observed and  written by an outstanding journalist.<br />I'd somehow never even connected him with this tender memoir, perhaps because I'd managed to avoid  reading it in grade school.  (my wife has been reaping a savage revenge, parading around the house  sneering at my failure to read it and questioning the value of a Mountain High School [West Orange,  NJ] education.)  While Gunther was finishing Inside USA, his 16 year old son, Johnny, was diagnosed  with a brain tutor and died within 15 months.  Gunther wrote the piece for friends and family, but was  prevailed upon to publish it in order to comfort other parents and, in the manner of such things, it has  become his most enduring work.  It's absolutely wonderful and I can see why it is assigned reading for  so many kids.<br />The tragedy of Johnny Gunther is the human tragedy writ small; his triumph is our triumph.  At one  point Johnny cried out to his Mother : I have so much to do! And there's so little time!  This is the  dilemma that confronts mankind.  Our mortality will prevent us from achieving all of the things that  we yearn to accomplish.  How much worse to know that you will die before even becoming a man?<br />But Johnny Gunther did not despair.  He did not sink into maudlin self-pity.  He struggled against the  illness and lived as full a life as time allotted.  He faced death bravely, trying to comfort doctors and  family who were frustrated by their inability to save him.  As his father wrote: ...he did not die like a  vegetable.  He died like a man, with perfect dignity.<br />Inured as we have become to stories of death, particularly early death--having gone from Brian's Song  to Love Story to disease-of-the-week TV movies--it is easy to forget that the best of these stories, and  this is certainly one of the best, demonstrate the indomitable human spirit and the heroism that is  accessible to all of us.

It is sort of the literary equivalent of Leni Reifenstahl's Triumph of the  Will.  Let me make it clear that I yield to noone in my admiration for the men who fought in WWII.  Anyone who fights honorably in his nation's service is deserving of our respect and our thanks.  But  here are a few of the questions that are necessarily raised by Mr. Brokaw's treacly hyperbole:<br />  *The first generation of Americans settled and subdued an unknown land.  The Revolutionary  generation created the nation and defeated the world's greatest empire.  The Civil War generation  saved the Union and freed the slaves.  Brokaw's subjects won a war in Northern Africa, France,  Italy and the South Pacific.  By what stretch of the imagination was their battle vital to the nation's  existence?<br />  *If there really was a horrible darkness falling on Europe and this generation fought it out of a  sense of duty, why did they stay out of the fight for a full two years, until the Japanese attacked us?<br />  *Why did they declare war only on Japan at that point, waiting until Hitler declared war on us to  return the favor?<br />  *Is there any reason to believe that there has ever been a generation of Americans who would have  reacted differently to the bombing of Pearl Harbor?  Wouldn't every generation of Americans have  eagerly sallied forth to crush Nippon?  Succeeding generations fought to free South Korea, South  Vietnam and Kuwait; does Brokaw really wish to suggest that they would not have fought Tojo?<br />  *Is it appropriate to consider this generation the nation's greatest considering the fact that the  Armed Forces were segregated and that we interred our own American Japanese population during  the war?<br />  *How difficult a task was it to win WWII?  With Japan failing miserably in its desperate gamble at  Pearl Harbor and the German offensive grinding to a halt in Russia, was there any way that we  could have failed to win the war or wasn't this merely a mopping up operation, however costly?<br />  *Having freed half of Europe, why did this generation abandon the Eastern half of the continent to  the ministrations of Stalin and the USSR?  Do the dead of the gulag really feel comforted by the  fact that America allowed them to be murdered by Stalin and not Hitler?<br />  *Did this generation's responsibilities cease on V-J Day?  Besides the question of the Soviet Union,  where was this generation during the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, etc?  Were they responsible for  these failures or merely unsupportive of our soldiers during them?<br />  *Do the difficulties of the Depression and service in WWII really justify the massive transfer of  payments that this generation has secured to themselves from future generations?  Social Security,  Medicare, etc. are justly called entitlements; why is this generation the one in our history that felt  entitled to so much in exchange for their service to the nation?<br />  *Do they bear no responsibility for the enormous deficits that were rung up throughout their  lifetimes, in order to pay for the thorough Social Safety Net they demanded?  Deficits, mind you,  which our generation will be the one to pay off over the next twenty or thirty years.<br />  *Who is responsible for the tremendous cultural damage that their Baby Boom children have done  and are doing to this country?  Wasn't it this &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; that raised the most spoiled,  selfish, over indulged crop of brats ever to walk the face of the Earth?<br />Now Brokaw does treat many of these subjects--including interviews with Japanese Americans and  blacks--but does not even consider others and its obviously impossible to answer or justify most of  them.<br />In the end, what we're left with are some interesting oral histories, like the reminiscences of  George  Bush and Julia Child, that add fairly little to the prior work of folks like Studs Terkel (The Good War :  An Oral History of World War Two &amp; Hard Times : An Oral History of the Great Depression), unified  by a thesis that is completely risible.<br />GRADE: D+left with are some interesting oral histories, like the reminiscences of  George  Bush and Julia Child, that add fairly little to the prior work of folks like Studs Terkel (The Good War :  An Oral History of World War Two &amp; Hard Times : An Oral History of the Great Depression), unified  by a thesis that is completely risible.<br />GRADE: D+	2000-10-01

He can understand and sympathize with either side.  Hisbusiness is to be fair to them both.  If the novel has anotherpurpose, it is to point out that in the pride of our Americanliberties, we're apt to forget that already we've lost a good many tocivilization.  The American Indians once enjoyed far more than we.Already two hundred years ago, when restrictions were comparativelywith us, our ideals and restrained manner of existence repelled theIndian.  I thought that perhaps if we understood how these FirstAmericans felt toward us even then and toward our white way of life,we might better understand the adverse, if perverted, view of us bysome African, European, and Asian peoples today.  -Author'sIntroduction<br />As the above paragraph makes clear, this extremelypopular youth novel reflects the corrosive self doubt that has eatenaway at Western Civilization for most of this century.  Richter tellsthe story of a fifteen year old boy, named True Son.  He has beenraised by Lenni Lenape Indians after being taken from his whiteparents in a raid; his real name is John Butler.  As the story opens,the boy's Indian father informs him that the terms of a recent treaty(the year is 1764) require the return of all white captives. The boydesperately hopes to avoid going back and after being returned hecontinually seeks to escape.  When he eventually returns to theIndians, he goes on a raiding party, but in a fit of conscience, warnsaway some whites who are about to be ambushed.  His Indian fathersaves him from execution, but convinces him that he is now so taintedby his white blood that he must return to civilization.<br />This is an exciting story marred by the kind of starry eyed leftwing twaddle that characterizes far too much of children's literature.The saving grace is Richter's seeming acceptance of the fact that thisclash of cultures and the West's victory were inevitable.

He was fortunate,  therefore, that in that short fierce era between 1939 and 1945 he had met people who summoned  forth his deeper talents.&quot;  -comment by Emilie Schindler to a German TV documentary crew<br />This, of course, is the essential mystery of Oskar Schindler.  How was it that this charismatic but  morally ambiguous man, a failure in every other endeavor he ever engaged in, was both willing and  able to save over a thousand Jews from Nazi predation?  And, if someone like him was willing and  able, why were other, arguably &quot;better&quot;, Germans unwilling or unable to do the same?<br />These are the questions that Thomas Keneally's raises, but, despite the use of fictional techniques to tell  the story, Keneally does not seek to answer them.  Instead, he lays out the facts of the story (in thrilling  fashion) and leaves the reader to search for answers.  The result is an immensely human and interesting  portrait of an enigmatic hero--infinitely more interesting than the simplistic black and white  ubermensch of Spielberg's vapid movie.<br />Perhaps the greatest import of the book is that resistance was possible, even in Nazi Germany.  In the  face of this fact, those Germans who went along with the Nazis must be judged even more harshly.  This book and Jonah Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners combine to make  a powerful case for the view that the Final Solution was perpetrated by the German Nation as a whole  and that most Germans were willing to see it happen.  More than that, they raise the question of  whether it is appropriate to consider the citizenry of totalitarian states to be merely innocent victims of  the regimes, or whether we need to hold every citizen responsible for even the silent capitulation that  enables a reign of terror to continue.<br />I know that Spielberg has made a big deal out of making his movie available to schools and young  people; it would be much better to give them copies of this book.  That a man like Oskar Schindler  necessarily seems so remarkable to us, should be troubling to every person of conscience.  This book  forces us to look within and ask ourselves whether we too would have done the right thing.  The  answer is not as starkly clear as Hollywood would have us think.<br />GRADE: Ae to schools and young  people; it would be much better to give them copies of this book.

After several weeks in a coma, he woke to  find that he was one of the rare victims of a condition called &quot;locked-in syndrome&quot; or LIS, which had  left his mind functioning but his body almost completely paralyzed.  In a perverse sense he actually  got fairly lucky because, unlike most victims, he was still able to move one eyelid.  This allowed him  to work out, with a speech therapist, a system of communication which entailed winking as someone  slowly read through the alphabet.  By using this code, he could painstakingly spell out words,  sentences, paragraphs and, finally, this memoir.<br />The title of the book refers to the metaphors he uses to describe his situation.  The physical paralysis  leaves him feeling as if he was trapped within a diving bell, as if there is constant pressure pinning his  body into immobility.  However, at the same time, his mind remains as free as a butterfly and it's  flights are as random.  In fact, he calls the chapters of this book his &quot;bedridden travel notes&quot; and,  indeed, they eloquently relate his journey through memory.<br />Although Bauby's situation is obviously unique, this book has universal resonance because his  condition is itself an apt metaphor for the human condition.  It is the essence of Man's dilemma that  our infinitely perfectible minds are trapped within such weak containers of flesh and blood.  For most  of us, at most times, this frustrating dichotomy, between that which makes us godlike and that which  makes us mortal, lurks in the background; but the author has it thrust rudely into the foreground,  where it necessarily dominates his existence.  This makes it all the more remarkable that Bauby is able  to &quot;write&quot; about his life with such great humor and generosity of spirit and with so little bitterness.<br />Public opinion surveys reveal an interesting contrast in modern opinions on the &quot;right to die.&quot;  Contrary to the accepted wisdom, the so-called right is favored by those who are young and healthy,  but opposed by those who are old and sick.  The very premise which underlies such a right is the belief  that the quality of life experienced by the aged and the ill is so inadequate that they would willingly  choose death instead.  In fact, the evidence suggests that--despite the anecdotal horror stories with  which all of us are familiar--people generally cling to life even in the face of suffering which seems  unendurable to the well.<br />Bauby's book, for all the horror that we naturally feel at his status, is wonderfully optimistic and life  affirming.  Sure, there are a few moments of well earned self pity, but they are almost completely  drowned out by the author's enduring hopes and dreams and memories.  Jean-Dominique Bauby died  two days after this book was published, but in it's pages, he left behind one of the great testament's to  the splendor and majesty of the human spirit.  In these times when people tend to complain about the  pettiest matters, he reminds us that even when life is genuinely difficult, it is still quite beautiful and  invaluable and well worth living.<br />GRADE: A+on surveys reveal an interesting contrast in modern opinions on the &quot;right to die.&quot;   Contrary to the accepted wisdom, the so-called right is favored by those who are young and healthy,  but opposed by those who are old and sick.

I assume this one is  chosen because, while it is still great, it is one of his shorter efforts.<br />The story should be familiar, Dr. Alexander Manette is freed from his unjust imprisonment in the  Bastille and is reunited with his long lost daughter, Lucie, in England.  They are called as witnesses at  the treason trial of Charles Darnay, a dashing young Frenchman.  Darnay too is falsely accused, but he  is saved, in part by his resemblance to a law clerk named Sydney Carton.  Darnay and Lucie eventually  marry, though not before the wastrel Carton declares his love for her and his unworthiness of her.  He  pledges that one day he will prove himself worthy by doing her a service.  That opportunity comes  when Darnay is condemned to death by a French tribunal and sentenced to the guillotine.<br />This has been one of my favorite books since the 8th Grade.   There is no more thrilling moment in  literature then when Carton takes Darnay's place and bravely faces certain death.  It is a moment of  redemption that reminds us that great literature serves human purposes; we may never have such a  moment in our own lives, but the example instructs us in how we should face such a situation if the  time comes.  We can ask no more of ourselves than the courage and sense of honor to do that &quot;far, far  better thing.&quot;<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-01

Personally, even if Ginger hadn't been there, it always seemed like a  pretty idyllic existence.  (Lost in Space was a little easier to fathom; Dr. Smith was a royal pain &amp; the  kids were profoundly annoying.)  So when we were all sick one time and our Mom read us Swiss  Family Robinson, one of the immense satisfactions of the tale was that most of the family decided to  stay on their island after help came and even those who left seemed destined to return.  A couple of  years later we got to see the fine Disney version and, though it makes some significant changes in the  story, it too has been a favorite of mine ever since.<br />Johann Wyss's classic (it was actually completed by his son) is an extraordinarily unsubtle family  version of Robinson Crusoe.  The Robinson's are shipwrecked somewhere near New Guinea but  through pluck, self reliance, familial togetherness and a heavy dollop of Christian faith they manage to  create fairly comfortable lives for themselves, domesticating seemingly every animal known to man  and cultivating innumerable crops.<br />While their adventures are always instructive and informative, the book is awfully repetitious, we don't  really need the blow by blow description of how each animal is tamed and every foodstuff harvested.  And many folks will find the Christian message far to heavy-handed.  I actually think this is a case  where it's pretty easy to justify reading kids an abridged version, rather than the entire original text.  But the story is great fun and is particularly interesting as an example of the Western man regnant  species of writing.  The sort of blithe assumption that this family would completely conquer the  wilderness is a remnant of the age when white, Christian Europe/America had the utmost confidence in  our Manifest Destiny to rule nature.<br />It's hard to imagine a book like this being written today.  In fact, I recall a movie called Friday from  several years ago, which portrayed Robinson Crusoe as a sort of helpless fop, completely dependent on  Friday.  In the current climate of political correctness, an author approaching the Swiss Family  Robinson story would most likely ditch the religious angle entirely, have the family display much  greater sensitivity for the animals which they readily exploit in the novel and, of course, there's no way  the boys would be allowed to take such great pleasure in hunting and learning to shoot.  But, as it  stands, despite a little too much pedantry and proselytizing, this is just a good old-fashioned  adventure--kids, boys in particular, should thoroughly enjoy it.<br />GRADE: B-ok like this being written today.

For those of you who haven't heard this shtick yet, I'll repeat, in broad generalities, the basic concepts  that inform my Unified Theory of Human Existence.  Essentially, it holds that there are really just two  competing impulses and ideas that govern all of humanity, there's the, generally female, predilection  for Security and the, largely male, desire for Freedom. Take any issue or epoch and you will find that  battle lines drew up along these lines.  Now, while I, of course, favor the forces of Freedom in this  drama, I respect those who favor Security and understand the natural impulses that lead folks to yearn  for it.<br />But, these are only the healthy impulses, there are a couple of other omnipresent ideas and desires that  animate human affairs--to dominate and to be dominated--and I do not respect them; they are  malignant pathologies afflicting the human body politic.  These malevolent motivations arise at both  ends of the political spectrum and are best illustrated in the theories of Fascism, on the right, and  Communism, on the Left.  Despite the perceived antipathy between the two systems, both are in fact  based on the desire of some members in society to dominate their neighbors.  In the case of  Communism, the desire stems from the fear of the naturally unequal distribution of talent and  capabilities to humans.  Communism seeks to dominate the gifted in order to favor the weak.  Fascism,  on the other hand, presupposes that a certain group in society has special merit, typically a racial  group, and then seeks to dominate that group or even opposing nation, for the benefit of the chosen  group.<br />All of which brings us to Yukio Mishima's novel, The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea,  which along with Robert Musil's Young Torless, is perhaps the best fictional effort to depict the rise  of Fascist tendencies in the individual.  Mishima was an extraordinarily troubled fellow.  Raised by his  domineering grandmother, he determined at an early age that he was a homosexual.  He became  obsessed with sadomasochism, the body, martial arts, bodybuilding and the fascist militarism of  Japan's past.  In 1968 he founded the Shield Society, a kind of private Bushido-based army.  On  November 25, 1970, he tried to inspire a national uprising by taking over a military complex.  When  this failed miserably, he committed ritual suicide, seppuku.<br />In Sailor, he tells the story of Noboru, a teenage boy who spends his days roaming around with a gang  of vicious boys and his nights hiding in a wardrobe in order to spy on his widowed mother as she has  sex with her lover, the sailor Ryuji.  As he and the gang become more psychotic (at one point they kill  and skin a cat) and his mother and Ryuji announce their plans to marry, Noboru draws up a list of  charges against Ryuji.  When Noboru is discovered spying and Ryuji decides not to punish him, the  boys decide to execute him because he has become &quot;a father.&quot;<br />What precisely is the nature of this crime--being a father--as the boys see it?:<br />  There is no such thing as a good father because the role itself is bad.  Strict fathers, soft fathers,  nice moderate fathers--one's as bad as another.  They stand in the way of our progress while they  try to burden us with their inferiority complexes, and their unrealized aspirations, and their  resentments, and their ideals, and the weaknesses they've never told anyone about, and their sins,  and their sweeter-than-honey dreams, and the maxims they've never had the courage to live  by--they's like to unload all that silly crap on us, all of it!<br />Now, I don't know how much of this Mishima intended and how much of it his subconscious spewed  forth, but this father hatred is central to understanding his pathologies.  In a fundamental sense,  morality is a male construct; just as laws and regulations are fundamentally expressions of the female.  Legalism presupposes a willingness to yield freedom.  Eachlaw and regulation represents another chip  struck from the tree of liberty.  But when the entire skein of regulation is put in place, those whose  central concern is for security can rest easy.  Permissible behaviors are strictly delineated and a  powerful security state necessarily exists to enforce them.  Thus, the boys in Noboru's gang, determine  that they must commit a murder now, before they are adults, because the law will essentially allow  them to get away with it.<br />Freedom, on the other hand, requires a rigid personal moral system in order to function.  For only if  we can be confident that others will be restrained by an internalized understanding of right and wrong  will we be willing to grant each other the freedom that we ourselves desire.  Fear is the enemy of  freedom, morality its ally.  The father figure, representing as he does the imposition of internalized  moral inhibitions, is a threat to the boys.  Ryuji, in refusing to punish the boy, is confident that the  lesson can be learned and internalized without external punishment.  But it is this very attempt to  transmute the boy's values that guarantees the gang's enmity and results in his death sentence.<br />This is an extremely creepy story.  It offers a pretty disturbing glance into the psyche of a troubled  genius and seems likely to remain the pinnacle of gay, fascist, Japanese literature.<br />GRADE: Cyield freedom.

Fear is the enemy of  freedom, morality its ally.  The father figure, representing as he does the imposition of internalized  moral inhibitions, is a threat to the boys.  Ryuji, in refusing to punish the boy, is confident that the  lesson can be learned and internalized without external punishment.  But it is this very attempt to  transmute the boy's values that guarantees the gang's enmity and results in his death sentence.<br />This is an extremely creepy story.  It offers a pretty disturbing glance into the psyche of a troubled  genius and seems likely to remain the pinnacle of gay, fascist, Japanese literature.<br />GRADE: C	2000-10-01

At least by those who do consider him at all.  To be perfectly frank, I'd never  really heard of the guy before now.  But this excellent gothic tale, which was based on the true story of  a farmer who thought that angels had commanded him to kill his own family,  is so clearly the  forerunner of the fiction of everyone from Hawthorne and Melville to Poe and Henry James to H.P.  Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard right on up to Shirley Jackson and Stephen King, that it is hard to  believe that his work is not better known nor taught more often.<br />Wieland, his first novel, tells the story of a religious fanatic who builds a temple in the seclusion of his  own farm, but then is struck dead, apparently by spontaneous combustion.  Several years later, his  children, in turn, begin to hear voices around the family property, voices which alternately seem to be  commanding good or evil and which at times imitate denizens of the farm.  Are the voices somehow  connected to a mysterious visitor who has begun hanging around?  Are they commands from God?  From demons?  Suffice it to say things get pretty dicey before we find out the truth.<br />This is a terrific creepy story which obviously influenced the course of American fiction.  Brown  develops an interesting serious theme of the role that reason can play in combating superstition and  religious mania, but keeps the action cranking and the mood deliciously gloomy.  The language is  certainly not modern but it is accessible and generally understandable.  It's a novel that should be better known and more widely read, if not for historical reasons then just because it's great fun.<br />GRADE: A	2000-10-01

Mario Castigliani is the  handsome but nearly broke clairvoyant who has brought his mind reading act to Floraville, Georgia.  Beaufort Tyler the personable young police chief enlists his aid to look into the apparent suicide of a  local civil rights pioneer and union activist who seems to have hung himself.  &quot;Seems to&quot; because his  death could be linked to labor unrest at the powerful town mill, to the recent release from prison of a  rabid racist, even to the similar hanging death of the prior chief of police.<br />The mystery though is simply the point of departure for a richly textured fish-out-of-water story, as  Castigliani brings his cosmopolitan, continental sensibilities and his psychic gift to bear on this sleepy  Southern burgh.  The book is at it's best when he's interacting with the locals and attempting to  understand their lives, an understanding made easier by his ability to read their thoughts.  Less  effective are the continuing flashbacks to his earlier life in Italy and on the stage.  This all could be  better handled in one longer passage early on, which would help the narrative flow of the novel.<br />At any rate, Mario Castigliani and Beau Tyler make an agreeable, if unlikely, team and the authors  populate the town with plenty of interesting characters, some comic, others tragic.  They also make it  easy to suspend disbelief about Mario's paranormal powers, mostly treating him as hypersensitive to  the thoughts of others, rather than having him resort to all kinds of mental pyrotechnics.  Likewise,  they show the many mundane tricks he uses to beguile his audience, which makes for one of the most  absorbing sections of the book.  By not pushing the psychic angle too hard, they keep the focus on the  characters and deliver a murder mystery with a crafty twist.<br />GRADE : B<br />GRADE : B	2000-10-01

So when Ernest Stickley, Jr. tries brazening his way out of the lot after Ryan catches him  boosting a car, Frank decides to play dumb at the trial and Stick skips.  Ryan explains his plan:<br />  Stick...I'm talking about simple everyday armed robbery.  Supermarkets, bars, liquor stores, gas  stations, that kind of place.  Statistics show--man, I'm not just saying it, the statistics  show--armed robbery pays the most for the least amount of risk.  Now, you ready for this?  I see  how two guys who know what they're doing and're businesslike about it,; who're frank with  each other and earnest about their work, can pull down three to five grand a week.<br />And Frank doesn't just have a plan, he also has 10 rules for success and happiness, Ryan's Rules:<br />  1.  Always be polite on the job.  Say please and thank you.  2.  Never say more than necessary.  3.  Never call your partner by name--unless you use a made-up name.  4.  Dress Well.  never look suspicious or like a bum.  5.  Never use your own car. (Details to come.)  6. Never count the take in the car.  7.  Never flash money in a bar or with women.  8. Never go back to an old bar or hangout once you have moved up.  9.  Never tell anyone your business.  Never tell a junkie even your name.  10. Never associate with people known to be in crime.<br />For a while, the two are able to follow the plan and the rules and they are extremely successful.  In  one of the best bits in the book, they go into a bar and when someone else robs it, they rob the robber.  But, inevitably, the rules start falling by the wayside and when they see a chance for a big score, the  rules go out the window, with predictably disastrous results.<br />Elmore Leonard novels can be like popcorn, you start consuming them by the handful, and there is a  tendency to experience deja vu if you read too many too close together.  I also think he became too  dialogue dependent in his middle years, after receiving near universal acknowledgment as the best  writer of dialogue in the business.  But, perhaps because it was written relatively early in his career,  Swag stands out as a great crime novel.  Leonard obviously liked it too; he brought Stick back in an  eponymous novel, that's also pretty good.<br />GRADE: Aest bits in the book, they go into a bar and when someone else robs it, they rob the robber.

Such is definitely  the case with The Iron Giant by Ted Hughes--once England's poet laureate, now best remembered,  albeit unfairly, by angry feminists as the husband who drove Sylvia Plath to her grave.  Hughes tells  the amiable story of a huge metal robot who crashes to Earth and after putting himself back together  begins to sate his enormous appetite for metal by devouring cars and tractors and the like.  Infuriated  local farmers trap him, despite the efforts of one friendly boy named Hogarth.  But the Iron Giant turns  out to be quite useful when an enormous space-bat-angel-dragon attacks Earth and demands a tribute of  animate matter to consume.  The Iron Giant agrees to battle the monster, vanquishes him and  determines that the creature is actually peaceful but was attracted to Earth by man's violence.  The  space-bat-angel-dragon agrees to return to space, where his &quot;music of the spheres&quot; has such a calming  effect that Earth becomes a peaceful place.<br />Now the intent of Hughes's original story, as well as that of the very good recent movie which is  loosely based on it, is to show the futility of war, violence, etc.  Hughes book was written at the height  of the Cold War and the space-bat-angel-dragon can be understood to be the Left's idealized version of  the Soviet Union--a threat only because of our own attitudes and actions.  The Soviet Union having  been disposed of in subsequent years, the movie makes a more generalized anti-gun, anti-military,  pro-nonconformity statement.  But the truly delicious irony in both cases is that the most obvious  subtext of the story is at war with the intended central message.  Because, at the end of the day, the  Iron Giant is nothing less than Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative come to life and saving the  world.  The author's pacifist message and the filmmaker's antiestablishment message are overwhelmed  by the powerful metaphorical symbol of a gigantic defensive weapon being the only thing standing  between mankind and certain destruction.  How delightful the irony that book and movie basically end  up being pleas for the biggest boondoggle in the history of the military-industrial complex.<br />I liked both book and movie very much.  The film in particular may be the best non-Disney animated  feature film ever made.  Obviously the symbolism of the Iron Giant has escaped the control of the  storytellers; but the metaphorical ironies merely add an additional layer of enjoyment.<br />GRADE:<br />Book: B+<br />Film: A-nt is nothing less than Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative come to life and saving the  world.

There's Beryl Markham's West With the Night, the various works of Saint Exupery and in  addition to the writings of Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the Lone Eagle himself, Charles Lindbergh, won  the Pulitzer for The Spirit of Saint Louis.  Certainly they had all lead fascinating and exciting lives, so  they had good material to work with when it came to autobiography and memoirs, but how then  explain the slight but enchanting fable of The Little Prince?<br />Saint Exupery's classic tale can be read on many levels and enjoyed by readers of any age.  He tells the  story of being stranded in the desert and meeting a tiny blond boy.  This Little Prince proceeds to tell  of his travels from planet to planet until he arrived on Earth and of what he has learned along the way.  The most important thing he reveals is a secret that was taught him by a fox that he tamed:<br />  And he went back to meet the fox.  &quot;Goodbye&quot; he said.<br />  &quot;Goodbye,&quot; said the fox.  &quot;And now here is my secret, a very simple secret:  It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;  what is essential is invisible to the eye.&quot;<br />  &quot;What is essential is invisible to the eye,&quot;  the little prince repeated,  so that he would be sure to remember.<br />  &quot;It is the time you have wasted for your rose  that makes your rose so important.<br />  &quot;It is the time I have wasted for my rose--  &quot;said the little prince  so he would be sure to remember.<br />  &quot;Men have forgotten this truth,&quot; said the fox.  &quot;But you must not forget it.  You become responsible, forever,  for what you have tamed.  You are responsible for your rose. . .&quot;<br />  &quot;I am responsible for my rose,&quot;  the little prince repeated,  so that he would be sure to remember.<br />This is the central lesson of the story--love and responsibility for one another.  And just as this is  essentially the message of Christ, from here on in the rest of the story is a fairly straightforward  Christian allegory.  As Saint-Exupery is dying of thirst, the Little Prince leads him to a well, the water  of which is uniquely refreshing.  Then the Little Prince announces that the time has come for him to go  away, that a snake will bite him and it will look like he is suffering greatly, but that he will live on in  Saint-Exupery's heart and mind and can never die.<br />Regardless of whether you read the story as simply a delightful children's fable or read it as an  existential or a Christian myth, or read it multiple times and find a different meaning each time, it is  endlessly rewarding and quite beautiful.

(For a sample of her fatuous  political philosophy, check out her essay:  When Reasonable-Woman Standards Are Applied, Society  Will Benefit which essentially asks that we abandon objective legal standards in favor of subjective  ones.)  But I do also have to admit that in one very specific sense I found this book to be a page-turner:  I couldn't wait to see how she would reconcile her liberal ideology with the logical requirements of the  story she has to tell.  However, my eager anticipation went for naught, as she instead disregards logic  and simply yields the story to ideology.<br />The novel tells the story of a woman who flees an abusive husband and, with the help of a modern day  underground railroad, establishes new identities for herself and her son in Florida.  The book opens  after she has fled, so the only possible dramatic conclusion to the story is a final confrontation with the  husband.  The husband by the way is naturally a New York City cop--we all know how awful the  police are--and just in case she's been too subtle in her approach to the material, Quindlen makes it  clear that in addition to being abusive, he is also a racist and a homophobe, though oddly enough, the  wife who grew up in the same milieu and has been married to him for umpteen years is completely  devoid of any prejudice whatsoever.  And how does this bright, resourceful woman prepare for the  showdown that we can all tell is coming?  She keeps a crowbar under the bed.  That's right, a crowbar,  not a gun.<br />Ms Quindlen is so tightly bound by her own doctrinal opposition to guns that she does not allow her  heroine to take the single most sensible step for self-protection available to a woman in her position.  Horror movies notoriously rely on the convention of having the central characters make idiotic choices;  I've not seen it but have read that in the new film Scary Movie a character is being pursued by the  killer and sees a table with something like a submachine gun, a hand grenade, a chain saw and a  banana, and chooses the banana to defend herself.  This is funny in the context of a horror spoof, but in  the context of what is seemingly supposed to be a realistic depiction of an abused woman, her  metaphorical choice of the banana is not merely unbelievable, but also profoundly annoying.  The wife,  Fran Benedetto, has already strained the reader's patience with statements which appear to make her a  nearly willing accomplice to the beatings in the first place:<br />  Whatever it was that made me soft and wet and warm whenever Bobby Benedetto whispered in my  ear was part of whatever it was that made him twist my arm and slap my face.<br />But with the tension of the plot and Fran's own intuition of danger mounting, one struggles in the face  of this stupidity to control a powerful urge to yell at the book : Get serious, buy a gun!<br />There's nothing wrong with the practice of authors allowing their political convictions to guide their  fiction.  Indeed, George Orwell argued, and I would agree, that all writing is political.  Ms Quindlen's  problem is not her political views specifically, though they are loathsome; her real problem is that she  allows those politics to disfigure her story.  It is simply not plausible that a responsible, terrified adult  would fail to arm herself in this situation.  The failure to take this necessary precaution lends an  unfortunate air of &quot;just desserts&quot; to her final beating and the loss of her child.  Authors are entitled to  make certain demands of their readers, but asking them to be sympathetic to a character who behaves  this stupidly is asking too much.<br />GRADE: D+diotic choices;  I've not seen it but have read that in the new film Scary Movie a character is being pursued by the  killer and sees a table with something like a submachine gun, a hand grenade, a chain saw and a  banana, and chooses the banana to defend herself.

In her own  day, Hurston was recognized as a leading figure of the Harlem Renaissance, doing ground breaking  work on black folklore, collaborating with Langston Hughes and writing an autobiography, several  novels and many short stories.  But she had the great misfortune to fall afoul of her fellow black  intellectuals, like Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison, who took offense at her use of vernacular  language in her stories and who thought that her writing was not sufficiently negative about the black  experience in America.  Her opponents were better connected politically and saw to it that she was  dismissed by the Left intelligentsia.  She died in obscurity in a Welfare home and her works went out  of print, largely forgotten.  Then, in 1975, Alice Walker wrote a piece for Ms Magazine, about her  search for Hurston's grave and began a reawakening of interest in her work.  Walker's attentions seem  to have been amply repaid, as this fine novel seems to have been a significant influence on her own  book The Color Purple.<br />Their Eyes Were Watching God tells the story of Janie Crawford.  Raised in Florida by a  grandmother, she experiences several loveless marriages, but develops into a strong and independent  woman, then finds love with an itinerant worker named Tea Cake...Besides the central theme of Janie's growth as a woman, the story is similar to The Color Purple for  the almost eerie absence of white people.  This was, in fact, one of the complaints lodged against her  in the 30's, that she shied away from the issues of race and racism that other authors were focussing on  and bringing to public attention.  The novel does also render characters' speech in unvarnished dialect.  You can see why fellow authors would have been embarrassed by the language, but that does not  delegitimize its use.<br />In the end, the very things that her cohort found objectionable about her work--the colorful dialogue  and the relatively upbeat portrayal of black characters--make Hurston's writing much more enjoyable  than the earnest but polemical, to the point of agitprop, works of folks like Wright and Ellison.  I  liked the book quite a bit; which actually, when you get right down to it, pretty much proves Richard  Wright's point.<br />GRADE: Bt  delegitimize its use.<br />In the end, the very things that her cohort found objectionable about her work--the colorful dialogue  and the relatively upbeat portrayal of black characters--make Hurston's writing much more enjoyable  than the earnest but polemical, to the point of agitprop, works of folks like Wright and Ellison.

In fact, The Sound and the Fury and Ulysses  can make you rue the day you learned to read.

I thought not.<br />The Hardy Boys were created, along with Nancy Drew and the Bobbsey Twins and myriad others, by Edward L. Stratemeyer (1862-1930).  He would then outline stories and farm them out to writers hired  through his Stratemeyer Syndicate--which sounds like the literary equivalent of the Triangle Shirt  Waist factory.  The resulting stable of series must surely be the most read children's books of all time,  even in this era of Goosebumps and Harry Potter.<br />Frank and younger brother Joe are the sons of the renowned detective Fenton Hardy, who always seems  to be away on an important case.  Between attending class and winning football games for Bayport  High, the boys manage to investigate their own fair share of suspicious doings.  This fairly typical  entry finds the brothers involved in a case which includes a local Indian tribe (yes they were still  Indians then) and some dubious characters who keep trying to break into their Dad's safe.<br />Blessedly free of strong language, serious violence, sexual subtexts or weighty social issues, the books  are suitable for all ages.

But, especially when the missing boy comes back, you have to ask yourself:  &quot;Wasn't he better off away from this repellent mother?&quot;  And this is a real weakness in the book.  If  you want us to feel some empathy for Beth, you can't have our first impression of her be her telling her  husband, unconcerned that the boys might hear her,  that she only loves her baby daughter.  And then,  when we're supposed to be feeling her pain later, you might want to drop the scene where she boinks  her high school boyfriend, with its pretty clear implication that she was so set on getting into his pants  at the reunion that she didn't care where Ben went.<br />In the end, I just disliked Beth so much that I did not care what happened to her and hoped that the  whole family would escape her malignant clutches.<br />GRADE: C-	2000-10-01

There were only two  mysteries--The Postman Always Rings Twice  and The Maltese Falcon .  There were no Westerns.  And, except for the dystopic classics A Clockwork Orange , Brave New World,  1984  and Animal Farm, there were no Science Fiction or Fantasy novels.  Now among others, this  means that Raymond Chandler's Lew Archer series, J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Frank  Herbert's Dune were all left off of the list.  Never mind how far superior these books are to most of  the dreck that did make the cut, what really stands out is the fact that high brow critics still fail to take  authors seriously if they work in these mediums.<br />This is truly inexplicable.  It seems that these genres still bear an indelible stigma from the days of the  pulp magazines.  The intelligentsia appear to be incapable of separating these often vital and  fascinating stories from their humble beginnings.  In a more just world, Toni Morrison's Beloved would be ignored because it simply isn't very good and Octavia Butler's Kindred  would be celebrated, regardless of its time travel elements, because it is truly excellent.  The premise  of this fine novel is that a modern black woman is thrown backwards in time whenever her white,  slave-owning ancestor's life is threatened.  Beginning in his childhood she is repeatedly called upon to  preserve him, that she might one day be born.  To a certain and disconcerting degree, she eventually  becomes complicitous in the system of slavery and in this master's action of getting a slave with child.<br />Butler does not bother trying to explain the mechanics of time travel, nor does she seek some elaborate  justification for why these events occur.  Instead, she simply utilizes this plot device to raise really  troubling ethical questions and to give the reader an immediate experience of the horrifying legacy of  slavery which so often seems quite remote.  This is, by any measure, a great and haunting book.<br />GRADE: Aan immediate experience of the horrifying legacy of  slavery which so often seems quite remote.

Has there ever been a  less desirable job title than scrivener?  They were employed by lawyers to transcribe legal documents,  and if that isn't inhuman enough, the office in which Bartleby works has windows which face the brick  walls of surrounding skyscrapers.  Bartleby mystifies his employer, our narrator, first by refusing to  assist in proof reading documents, averring &quot;I would prefer not to.&quot;  But in short order he is preferring  not to do most anything, including leave the building after he is fired.  Bartleby is finally removed by  the police and starves to death in the Tombs, preferring not to eat.<br />Melville keeps Bartleby, like Moby Dick,  shrouded in mystery.  The only explanation offered for his  behavior is that he was forced to leave his patronage job in a dead letter office when administrations  changed over.  This leaves the reader free to freight Bartleby with any significance one desires and  makes him a truly haunting figure.<br />GRADE: A	2000-10-01

When he creates his work it's so original  and exciting that it spawns a legion of imitators, but decades down the road, when folks pick up that  seminal work, it feels dated and derivative.  This seems to be the case with Thieves Like Us.  When it  was published, Anderson was compared to Faulkner and Hemingway.  Then it looks like the book  experienced lengthy periods when it was out of print, experienced revivals when it was twice adapted  for the movies and currently enjoys a fairly strong reputation as a representative noir crime story from  the Depression, along the lines of Hammett or Chandler.  Now those are some pretty weighty  comparisons to be throwing around, and I don't know that they are fair, but the book will stand quite  nicely on it's own.<br />Anderson tells the story of three convicts: Elmo &quot;Chicamaw&quot; Mobley, T.W. &quot;T-Dub&quot; Masefield and  Bowie Bowers, who escape from an Alcatona, OK prison in 1935 and return to the only jobs they are  any good at--robbing banks.  The three quickly pile up a tidy sum of cash and start living high on the  hog, at which point the story focusses on Bowers and his courtship of a young girl named Keechie.  The plot elements are familiar: folks don't mind the boys robbing banks because so many lost their  bank deposits in the Crash that they figure bankers are thieves, alcohol and gambling eat away at the  money pretty quickly, everyone dreams of going straight and just needs a little sum of ready cash to do  so but that cash always seems to disappear, young lovers go on the lam, there's sensationalistic press  coverage and when the boys set out to commit one last robbery, we're fairly sure there's trouble  ahead.  But it's all deftly handled, in spare, punchy prose and, except for some brief sermonizing about  evil capitalists, it's reasonably free of working class cant; a seminal work of crime fiction.<br />GRADE: B+	2000-10-01

Brian DePalma, like Sergei  Eisenstein, uses our fear for the infant to heighten the tension of the scene.  White Oleander is one long  jouncing ride down the stairs.<br />Astrid Magnussen is the thirteen year old daughter of Ingrid, a beautiful but demented, selfish,  narcissistic, egomaniacal poetess.  When Ingrid is shunned by a lover, she kills him and is imprisoned.  Astrid is sent to a series of foster homes where she encounters a variety of fairly dubious maternal  figures--a born again stripper, a racist living next to a prostitute, a totalitarian Mexican, a depressive  actress and a tough Russian.  Given the purpleness of Fitch's prose, at every stop the reader is sort of  waiting for disaster to strike, for the baby to spill out of the carriage, but most of the foster homes  actually turn out to be reasonably decent places. In fact, it is Astrid herself who manages to screw up  almost every one of these homes, or when she doesn't, her mother does out of jealousy.  Despite this  sequence of disasters, she manages to emerge as a fairly likable and pulled together young woman with  a healthy contempt for, but an unhealthy attraction to, her mother.<br />I thought the book worked best as a cautionary tale about the atomization of the family.  Astrid does  not know her own father (in fact, men are little more than props in the book) and there is no family  member to take her in when her mother is jailed.  The families she is placed with are pretty  dysfunctional.  And, of course, Ingrid is hardly a mother, doing little more than encouraging Astrid to  read dreck like Henry Miller and Anais Nin and periodically warning her not to become close to her  surrogate families.<br />The child-in-danger tension and the desperation of the broken family made the book readable.  I was  less impressed with Fitch's much praised prose.  Like the oleander of the title, I thought it had a  hothouse effect; pretty words strung together do not necessarily make for good writing.  For example,  here's Astrid describing her mother:<br />  The edge of her white kimono flapped open in the wind and I could see her breast, low and full.  Her beauty was like the edge of a very sharp knife.<br />Which is it?  Is she full breasted or knifelike?  The two are mutually exclusive.  There are times when  this kind of language seems to run out of control and become too cloying; luckily the episodic story  usually brings it back to earth.  Likewise, the novel sometimes teeters on the brink of soap opera or  daytime talk show antics (the families often seem like they are drawn from episodes of Oprah or Jerry  Springer) and threatens to descend into cheap melodramatics, but then the next section starts and begins  a new cycle.<br />Overall, I'd say that this was one of the better books I've read from the Oprah Book collection, despite  some significant flaws.  And what really saved it for me was Astrid's capacity to judge her mother quite  harshly and hold her responsible for her actions.<br />GRADE: C+with Fitch's much praised prose.

It is indeed an old-fashioned crowd pleaser, an almost Capraesque  throwback to the great American films of the 40's.  It tells the story of four boys from a West Virginia  coal town, a company town right out of Tennessee Ernie Ford's great song Sixteen Tons.   In a  football crazed high school, none of the boys is a very good athlete.  Quentin, in fact, is a bookish  nerd shunned by the rest of his classmates.  Homer, their ringleader, decides, in the wake of the  Sputnik launch, that they will build a rocket of their own.  After some initial misfires, including  demolishing his mother's prized picket fence, and despite the initial resistance of Homer Sr., who  manages and truly loves the mine, the boys eventually enlist the aid of the whole community in their  project and enjoy increasing success even as the town dies around them.  They even determine to try  and win the National Science Fair and the attending scholarships which will offer them an opportunity  to get out of town.  But their plans are smashed when local authorities accuse them of starting a forest  fire with one of their rockets and when Homer's Dad is injured in a mine collapse, he drops out of  school and goes to work in the mine.  But that of course is not the end of it, while working in the  mines, Homer teaches himself the mathematics required to prove that the fire could not have been set  by one of their launches.  Vindicated, he returns to school and goes on to win the big prize.  Along the  way, he even finds time to reconcile with his Dad.  The movie is exactly as hokey and sappy as it  sounds and I loved every second of it.<br />But as you're watching, it is awfully hard to suspend your disbelief enough to accept that this is a  &quot;true&quot; story.  There are simply too many coincidences and ironic twists, folks are just that little bit too  noble, events break a little too conveniently, until the unreality of the flow of events starts to impinge  on enjoyment of the tale.  Don't get me wrong; I still liked it, but that &quot;true story&quot; label was really  distracting.<br />At any rate, my curiosity piqued, I grabbed the book and found this epigraph:<br />    I have...taken certain liberties in the telling of the story, particularly having to do with the precise     sequence of events and who may have said what to whom.  Nevertheless, my intention in allowing  this     narrative to stray from strict nonfiction was always to illuminate more brightly the truth.         -Homer Hickman, Jr., Author's Note<br />Now, there was a time when virtually every author's first novel was understood to be a thinly veiled  autobiographical tale.  Unfortunately, our voyeuristic society seems to place a premium on &quot;reality&quot;  and so these novels have been replaced by obligatory memoirs.  These books are immediately suspect  because they so often recreate huge swathes of dialogue verbatim, often conversations which occurred  in childhood, which no one could possibly remember in such detail.  And, of course, real life is  seldom quite as interesting as fiction and events never happen as conveniently for the plot, so each  succeeding memoir relates events that seem increasingly less likely.  I mean, does anybody really think  that Frank McCourt (Angela's Ashes) got his grubstake by rolling an expired  money lender?  So at this point, when these supposedly true stories have become so obviously  fictionalized, why continue this charade?<br />Hickman's book is at least honest enough to tip the reader off that &quot;liberties&quot; have been taken.  The  story that follows is great fun--a cross between How Green Was My Valley (1939)(Richard Llewellyn  1906-1983)   (Grade: A+) and The Right Stuff (1979)(Tom Wolfe 1931-)    (Grade: A+)--and is  not quite as unbelievable as the movie.  One wishes that some editor somewhere wouldhave the great  good sense and the simple honesty to call a spade a spade and acknowledge that books like this are in  fact novels.  Drop the &quot;Memoir&quot; in the title and make an honest man of the author.  Then we can just  concentrate on the tale he has to tell, which is terrific.<br />GRADE: A-<br />MOVIE: GRADE: A	2000-10-01

This memoir takes her  from her birth up to her departure for graduate school in America; she would go on to become the first  woman president of Smith College.<br />I very much liked the first section of the book, which describes her young girlhood on a 30,000 acre  sheep station in the Australian outback.  It has much of the elegiac yearning of books like How Green  Was My Valley (1939)(Richard Llewellyn 1906-1983) and West With the Night (1941) (Beryl  Markham  1902-1986).  But as the book goes along it really takes on a sort of self pitying tone that I  found a bit hard to take.  In particular, she complains several times about how they weren't taught in  school about how badly the aborigines were treated and the precipitating cause of her flight from  Australia is an incident that she attributes to pure sexism.  But in general, the story seems to be saying,  &quot;Look at all I achieved despite my hard scrabble upbringing out in the bush.&quot;  Meanwhile, the girlhood  she describes, while it does seem a little lonely and quite taxing physically, comes across as nearly  idyllic and an ideal background for future self reliance and achievement.  Add to that the relative  wealth that her family eventually accumulates and the fortuitous appearance of scholarship money at  opportune moments and I have trouble seeing what she has to complain about, other than a  quarrelsome, but obviously lonely, mother.<br />She had me early, but lost me later--a half good book.<br />GRADE: C	2000-10-01

The two travel from farm to farm, one step ahead of trouble as Lennie's incredible  strength and feeble brain continually land them in trouble.  Other farm hands are struck by the rarity of  finding such men traveling as partners, but Lennie and George have a dream, a dream of a better life.  As soon as they can raise $600 they can buy a farm and be their own bosses and Lennie will get to raise  the rabbits that he loves, but has a tendency to accidentally crush.  Unfortunately, trouble awaits at the  farm where they are headed.  The ranch owner's son, Curley, can't control his new bride who has &quot;the  eye&quot; or his own temper which flares up whenever she starts flirting with the hired hands.<br />This is one of those books you had to read in 9th grade, largely because it was by a famous author and  it's short enough that teachers figure students might actually finish it.  If you haven't read it since, give  it another try.

The resulting work, Great Expectations, was  published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861.   This was his second  semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in  middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to  happiness.  In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years.  Indeed  he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words.  Despite,  or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.<br />Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her  seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery.  One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite,  Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;.  When  the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before  being carted back to prison.<br />Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward  Estella.  Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at  the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding  gown.  Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.<br />Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his  name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman.  Pip assumes, and Havisham  allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will  make him worthy of Estella.<br />As Pip risesin society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing  up.  He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber.  So he is stunned when he discovers that he is  actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being  transported.  Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger.   Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's  recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems  his debts and brings him home.  Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he  ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.<br />Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together,  that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love.  But at the urging of others, he changed the ending  and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her  experiences and her wretched marriages.<br />This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers.  It has everything you could ask for in  a novel:  central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better  people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's  in here.  I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the  very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-01

As the New  York Times correspondent in Vietnam in the early 60's, he was one of the most influential media  voices on the War and The Best and the Brightest was one of the first really important books on what  had gone wrong.  The success of the book freed him from the grind of daily newspaper work, but in  the succeeding years he has produced books on The Times, the auto industry and various sports, almost  all of which are characterized by  reportage of the highest quality.  I particularly liked The Reckoning,  wherein he recounts the fall of the American and the rise of the Japanese auto industries and Breaks of  the Game, in which he details one year in the life of the Portland Trail Blazers and which I maintain is  the only good basketball book ever written.  And, of course, he wrote the terrific Summer of '49,  about the rivalry between the Red Sox of Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio's Yankees.<br />In October 1964 he returns to baseball, this time to the World Series showdown between the Yankees  and the Cardinals, and combines the detailed reporting for which he is known, with a theme similar to  that of The Reckoning.  For what truly interests him about that year, a seemingly ordinary enough  season in most respects, is the aspect of race and how the different teams dealt with it.  He explores the  manner in which the Cardinals, through their commitment to finding and developing black players,  were leading a revolution in the game of baseball, building their team around superior speed and  athleticism and the burning desire to succeed.  He contrasts them with the Yankees, an increasingly  fossilized institution, refusing to use black players, attempting to quash free spirits and unable to  replace declining stars like Mantle and Ford.<br />Now if, like me, you grew up listening to Bill White and Phil Rizzuto and Tim McCarver broadcast  baseball games, many of the stories in here will be familiar.  In fact, I became conscious for perhaps  the first time of the difference between a great reporter and great writer as I was reading this book.  I  really noticed that large swaths of the book are simple regurgitation of interviews and the judgments  about the game that are being related are not even his own, they are the interviewees.  If Mel  Stottlemyre  told him that the key to pitching was throwing breaking balls and keeping the ball down,  then that's Halberstam's belief.  I don't know whether he actually doesn't know all that much about the  game or simply chose to believe the professionals, but I found a lot of the opinion that he offers to be  unconsidered.  His editorial voice wafts very faintly through the book, emerging only on the racial and  labor issues (Curt Flood of the Cardinals would be the first man to challenge baseball's restrictive  contracts, paving the way for free agency).  Much of the rest reads like a reporter conveying the  players' impressions after a game.  There are also some really annoying repetitions in the book,  redundancies which any editor should have caught, assuming editors still exist.<br />But on balance I liked the book.  His essential &quot;changing of the guard&quot; premise is absolutely correct.  Black players completely dominated the 60's and 70's, not merely for athletic reasons but also because  they were simply hungrier and had more to gain (for much the same reason, Irish then Jews and  Italians enjoyed their hey day earlier in the century and Latin American players are in the ascendancy  now).  The more aggressive signing of black talent also led to a long period of dominance by the  National League after years of Yankee invincibility.  This racial theme gives the book a greater social  resonance than most sports fare which, combined with the baseball lore, would seem to make the book  an ideal vehicle to teach young adults about the civil rights struggles in a format they'd find interesting  and entertaining.<br />GRADE: Bresting  and entertaining.<br />GRADE: B	2000-10-01

I'd read his Tom Jones a couple of  years ago and found it kind of tough sledding, but when I stumbled upon this one at a library book sale  for a quarter, it seemed a stroke of destiny.<br />The parallels with Don Quijote are readily apparent.  First of all, the book consists of a series of  humorous travel adventures; second, the travellers involved seem too innocent to survive in the harsh  world that confronts them.  When Joseph Andrews, the naive footman of Lady Booby, deflects the  amorous advances of both her Ladyship and Slipslop, the Lady's servant, he is sent packing.  Upon his  dismissal, Joseph, along with his friend and mentor Parson Adams, an idealistic and good-hearted rural  clergyman, who essentially takes the physical role of Sancho Panza but the moral role of Quijote, sets  out to find his beloved but chaste enamorata, Fanny Goodwill, who had earlier been dismissed from  Lady Booby's service as a result of Slipslop's jealousy.  In their travels they are set upon repeatedly by  robbers, continually run out of funds and Adams gets in numerous arguments, theological and  otherwise.  Meanwhile, Fanny, whom they meet up with along the way, is nearly raped any number of  times and is eventually discovered to be Joseph's sister, or maybe not..  The whole thing concludes with  a farcical night of musical beds, mistaken identities and astonishing revelations.<br />I've seen this referred to as the first modern novel; I'm not sure why, in light of it's obvious debt to  Cervantes.

Sure, we all know that there's some kind of psychosexual component, but why horses in  particular?  At any rate, Black Beauty &amp; the rest of those equine tales (Black Stallion, National Velvet,  etc.) were never central to my childhood reading, but my wife fondly recalls her father reading it to  her--a topic I feel it is best to avoid commenting on.<br />Anna Sewell was left crippled by a childhood accident and depended on horses to get around.  A  Quaker, she was apparently extremely sensitive about any violence towards animals.  As the quote  above indicates, she even used prompting rather than prodding to guide her own rides .  In the closing  years of her life, suffering intense pain herself, she wrote this book to call attention to the mistreatment  of horses and it became a genuine publishing phenomenon.  She uses a first person (first horse?)  narrative to completely anthropomorphize Black Beauty, a well bred and even tempered stallion who  passes from owner to owner.  Over the course of the book, Beauty's owners display varying standards  of treatment from kindness to neglect to open brutality.  But Beauty perseveres and happily ends up  back with his original owners.  Along the way, Sewell also gets the opportunity to take some potshots  at hunting, drinking, poverty and the like.<br />It's easy to see how the story became a classic, thanks to its sympathetic portrayal of Beauty and his  fellow horses.  But it is fundamentally based on a lie.  Animals aren't human and horses aren't even  particularly intelligent by animal standards.  We shouldn't mistreat them because to do so is  unnecessary and counterproductive.  But to pretend that they have complex personalities and emotions  does them no service and sort of cheapens the dialogue about what &quot;rights&quot; animals should have.  The  book makes for a pleasant read, provided you don't let kids take it to seriously.<br />GRADE: B-t kids take it to seriously.<br />GRADE: B-	2000-10-01

While one has to acknowledge that stylistically he was one of the  most influential authors of the Century, it seems to me that his literary reputation really rests on Old  Man and the Sea and the Nick Adams stories, everything else is just psychosexual, faux macho,  posturing.  That said, you could do a hell of a lot worse careerwise than produce one of the best  novellas and several of the best short stories ever written.<br />The Old Man and the Sea is another one of those texts that you were assigned in 8th or 9th grade,  largely as a function of the author's stature and the brevity of the book (see also Of Mice and Men,  Orrin's Grade: A+).  And, of course, your teacher analyzed all the Christian symbolism, from the  bleeding palms to the marlin carcass as Cross.  Allow me to take a little different tack.<br />I recently had the great displeasure of reading The Affluent Society (John Kenneth Galbraith)(Grade:  F).  Mr. Galbraith argued that as Western society reached the novel stage of being affluent, that is  producing enough goods to meet the subsistence needs of every member of society, we would  inevitably rebel against the notion of work, our work hours would dwindle, people would demand four  or even three day weeks and many would opt out of the workplace all together.  We now realize of  course that this was the idle prattle of an effete twit.  Instead, the past fifty years have seen the massive  entry of women into the workplace (as a form of liberation no less) and folks working well past  retirement age and the past five years have seen the government demand that even the chronic  unemployed get jobs or lose benefits.  How could Karl Marx and Galbraith and all those liberal  thinkers have been so wrong about what motivates people?  It is quite simply a function of their  dependence on materialism.  This blinded them to cultural and spiritual influences on mankind and they  failed to reckon with these forces.<br />Hopefully, nobody who has ever read The Old Man and the Sea could possibly fail to understand that,  for most people, doing a job well, even, or especially, a physically taxing job, provides an abiding  sense of gratification and self worth.  Most of us are not alienated from our labor, we are challenged by  it.  Because of the dignity and grace that the old fisherman, Santiago, demonstrates in rising to face the  challenge--his exhibition of hard won skill and his determination in the face of overwhelming  odds--this book reaffirms the indomitable human spirit and reminds us of the possibility of  encountering the sublime in every day life and in the most lowly of labors and laborers.<br />There is more insight to the soul of man in the scant 127 pages of this book, than in all the volumes of  Marxist/Socialist pablum spewed forth in the past 100 years.  It is a fitting tribute, on the Centennial of  Hemingway's birth, that we remember him for this great tale.<br />GRADE: A+at motivates people?

Cared for by her nurse  Lootie, she lives in a mountain farmhouse while her father rules over the region from a mountain top  castle.  The local folk work as miners but are beset by the Goblins who inhabit the underground.  Irene  is saved from the Goblins by Curdie, a thirteen year old miner, and she in turn saves him.  The whole  thing is told in a pleasant conversational style and is filled with humor, word games, magic, derring-do,  and pure wonderment.<br />George MacDonald, a Congregational minister turned novelist, who seems nearly forgotten now, was  one of the seminal figures in the development of Fantasy.  His influence on other Fantasy authors is  obvious, he was a childhood favorite of JRR Tolkein, who especially liked this book, and C.S. Lewis  named him one of his favorite authors.  His own stories draw on many of the themes and characters of  classical European fairy tales.  But where they were often merely horrific and meaningless, MacDonald  adds a layer of Christian allegory.  Thus, Irene and Curdie are eventually saved by a thread so slender  that you can't even see it, but which leads them back to safety, teaching Curdie that you sometimes  have to believe in things that you can't see.<br />The book would be interesting simply as a touchstone of modern fiction, but it stands up well on its  own and will delight adults and children alike.<br />GRADE: A	2000-10-01

Thus, during the recent anniversary of the Moon Landing, I'm sure everyone had a  moment where they were sort of taken aback and realized--Holy Cripes! Those guys went to the Moon  in a vehicle that's less advanced technologically than my car.  Similarly, the journey of Lewis and  Clark is one of those things that lurks in your consciousness from grade school on, but you never really  think about what they did or what it meant.  Stephen Ambrose has provided the perfect remedy for that  oversight with this excellent book.<br />Structurally the book is a biography of Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) with heavy emphasis on the  28-month, 8,000-mile expedition that he lead (ending in September 1806), at President Thomas  Jefferson's behest,  along with William Clark (1770-1838).  Along the way, Ambrose, writing in a  nearly conversational style, weighs in on the many controversies surrounding the journey and the  participants.  He synthesizes the extensive scholarship about the trip, provides ample samples of the  journals they kept and draws upon his own personal knowledge of their route.  What emerges is, first  of all, a sweeping but detailed portrait of the trip, of the hardships and difficulties they faced and of the  fortitude and courage that they demonstrated every step of the way.  Second, and more importantly, he  puts the whole venture into perspective for us.  We share in Jefferson's vision of an America that  stretches from ocean to ocean; familiar as this is today, there was no certainty that it would become a  reality at the time (early 1800's).  Ambrose nearly overwhelms us with the sheer volume of physical  geography and species of flora and fauna that these men discovered.  From April through November of  1805 they were in territory that was completely unmapped.  (Had their journals and maps been  published more rapidly, virtually every river and physical feature from the Missouri River to the  Pacific Ocean would bear the names that they originated.)  Finally, as the story wends it's way to the  tragic conclusion, when a lonely, debt burdened and deeply depressed Lewis shot himself to death in a  travelers lodge on the Natchez Trace, one can't help feeling that America had lost one of it's greatest  heroes.<br />Ambrose has done a great job of recapturing the drama and the deeper meaning of a chapter from our  history that is all too easily taken for granted.<br />GRADE: A-hysical feature from the Missouri River to the  Pacific Ocean would bear the names that they originated.)

One of the first great literary works of Western Civilization, The Aeneid is the founding epic of Rome,  making the case for a sort of Roman version of Manifest Destiny.  It picks up with the fall of Troy and  follows Aeneas and a hardy band of survivors through their victory over and fusion with the Latins.   Along the way, it explains the undying enmity between Rome and Carthage, as Aeneas abandons his  lover Dido, Queen of Carthage, and, in its day, it served as a justification for the rise and rule of Caesar  Augustus, portraying the Roman Empire as predestined and paralleling Aeneas and Augustus as  instruments of that destiny.  In fact, Virgil, despite over a decade of effort, considered the work to be  unfinished and unworthy, so he requested that it be burned upon his death, but Augustus, thankfully,  intervened and saved it.<br />One interesting facet of the story is that Aeneas himself often takes a back seat to other characters.  In  particular Dido and the Latin warrior Turnus, prince of the Rutulians.  Indeed, Turnus emerges as one  of the great heroes in literature as he struggles against the fates and he wars against Aeneas and the  Trojans, whom the gods have decreed will rule all of Italy.<br />One of the great tragedies of modern education is the rarity of Latin and Greek in the curriculum,  replaced by French and Spanish.  Hard to believe I wasted 6 years on Spanish classes (never learning to  conjugate verbs mind you) when we could have been learning not merely the languages upon so much  of English is based, but also studying the great seminal works of Western Civilization.  The epic poems  of Virgil and Homer remain vital to our culture and remain well worth reading.<br />GRADE: A	2000-10-01

The book, apparently untouched since Ash's death, contains  numerous marginalia and personal papers, including two drafts of letters to an unnamed woman whom  the poet met at a breakfast in the 1850's.  Acting on impulse, Roland swipes the letters and embarks on  a quest to determine the identity of the intended recipient and to explore the ramifications of the  correspondence.  He determines that the object of Ash's interest was the fairly minor poetess Christabel  La Motte and, with the help of the beautiful but icy LaMotte scholar Maud Bailey, reconstructs the  relationship between the two--a relationship with ground shaking import for the understanding of both  authors' works.  Meanwhile, several more esteemed and powerful academics get wind of their search  and the quest turns into a race.  Along the way Roland and Maud peel back the further details of an  18th century love affair like the layers of an onion, and fall in love themselves.  Ultimately, the final  revelations about the lives of the poets are unveiled in a drawing room scene straight out of a British  mystery.<br />Byatt mixes thinly veiled references to historical figures (Ash is Robert Browning; LaMotte is Christina  Rosetti), literary forms (narrative, letters &amp; poetry), and genres (criticism, thriller, detective story,  quest, etc.) to create an entrancing novel of ideas.  Reminiscent of books like Josephine Tey's Daughter  of Time, Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose (whose influence she acknowledges),  and Julian Barnes's Flaubert's Parrot, she shows that the life of the mind can be thrilling and that a  literary mystery can be just as gripping as a noirish melodrama.<br />One caution: over the years, I've given this book to half a dozen people and I don't think a single one  of them finished it; I'm certain none of them much liked it.  I think the reason is that you can get  bogged down if you take the Victorian storyline too seriously.  It seems pretty clear that much of the  stuff on arcane points of interpretation and scholarly criticism is meant to be parody, not gospel.  It's  also easy to get lost in the poetry and the letters, with all their imagery and allusions; but keep in mind  that they are essentially McGuffins, meant to advance the plot, not an integral part of it themselves.  Byatt was quite consciously trying to write a novel that would be fun; it should be read for enjoyment,  not for talmudic effect.  At any rate, it's one of my favorite novels, and if you approach it like an arty  version of the Maltese Falcon, you'll love it too.<br />GRADE: A+n't think a single one  of them finished it; I'm certain none of them much liked it.

The novel tells the parallel tales of an unnamed young Englishwoman narrator and  her grandfather's scandalous first wife; the one in modern day India, the other in the Raj India of the  1920's.  As the younger woman travels to the scene of episodes in the older woman's letters, she reveals  details of the scandal.  Almost inevitably she begins to make the same mistakes as her predecessor and  ends the novel in similar straights.<br />This is an enormously deja vu inducing book.  We've encountered every scene and character countless  times before--the rigidly rational British colonial administrators, the catty British wives, the noble  natives, the effete British men and foolish women who are seduced by the setting and the scandal  ripped from the pages of Mandingo.<br />Two passages in the novel have the ring of truth:<br />The narrator meets several Western youths who have come to India seeking some mystic revelations,  but as one of them says:<br />  [I came] to find peace, but all I found was dysentery.<br />and following the initial scandal, one Major Minnies concludes:<br />  ...it is all very well to love and admire India--intellectually, aesthetically, he did not mention  sexually but he must have been aware of that factor too--but always with a virile, measured,  European feeling.  One should never, he warned, allow oneself to become softened (like Indians)  by an excess of feeling; because the moment that happens--the moment one exceeds one's  measure--one is in danger of being dragged over to the other side.<br />These are the two sentiments one takes away from the novel.

His legendary father fought in five wars and rose from private to three star general before  health problems cut short his career.  With him as a role model, it was perhaps inevitable that when the  time came, Lew would enthusiastically head to Vietnam.  This Pulitzer Prize winning autobiography  tells the story of Lew Puller's relationship with his father, his own service in Vietnam and of his heroic  attempt to rebuild his body and spirit after being dismembered by a booby-trapped howitzer round.  He lost his legs and his hands were badly mangled, but he managed to hold together his marriage, help  raise a son, earn a law degree and run for Congress.<br />Then, in the wake of losing the election, his always problematic drinking escalated to the point of  genuine alcoholism and he attempted suicide.  He went through rehab and became involved in things  like the Vietnam War Memorial project, which helped him deal with his ambivalence about the war;  ambivalence which he expresses best in discussing why he did not join other vets in throwing his  medals over the White House fence:<br />  As I sat silently in the dimly lit closet feeling the weight of the bronze and silver in my hand and  studying the red, white and blue stripes of my Silver Star and the majestic cameo of George  Washington on my Purple Hearts, I knew that I could never part with them.  They had cost me too  dearly, and though I now saw clearly that the war in which they had been earned was a wasted  cause, the medals still represented the dignity and the caliber of my service and of those with whom  I had served. I could no more discard them than I could repudiate my country, my Marine Corps or  my fellow veterans. As I put them away, I was very sad and very tired but grateful nonetheless that  my children were asleep in their beds in America rather than anywhere else in the world.<br />This thoughtfulness and undiminished patriotism inform the book and his heroic battle against injury,  alcohol and depression provide for a genuinely moving human drama.<br />But the book has a really tragic coda, because in 1994, Lew Puller killed himself.  There is a sort of a  cottage industry in Vietnam War myth making.  We've all heard about, or seen in movies, the  alarming number of Vets who went nuts (remember when Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was still just  called Vietnam Vet Syndrome).  Anecdotal evidence suggests that they had vastly elevated suicide  rates.  And then there is all the bilge about how the troops were disproportionately poor and minority,  about the effects they suffered from Agent Orange, and so on.  All of these are either complete canards  or wild exaggerations, but they live on because both Veterans groups and opponents of the War have a  vested political interest in perpetuating them.<br />It seems to me that it would be a real shame to remember Lew Puller as simply another casualty of the  War.  The devastating wounds, physical and psychic, that he received in Vietnam may well have been  the proximate cause of his death, but as I think this excellent memoir amply demonstrates, his feelings  of inadequacy were as much a function of measuring himself against a mythic father as they were a  result of a horrible injury.  His testimony of his own life and service to his country is too important a  contribution to our understanding of the cultural and familial forces that send young men to war for us  to reduce that life to a simple equation:  Gung Ho soldier + War - legs and hands = suicidal drunk.  We should instead take seriously his choice of titles; Fortunate Son reflects his understanding  that--while war and handicap and alcohol all play their part in the tale--his story is fundamentally  about a son trying to prove himself to a father and on some level reflects his belief that he had done  so.<br />GRADE: B+in the world.<br />This thoughtfulness and undiminished patriotism inform the book and his heroic battle against injury,  alcohol and depression provide for a genuinely moving human drama.<br />But the book has a really tragic coda, because in 1994, Lew Puller killed himself.

Based on the evidence of this book, it's easy to see why folks like him so much.<br />Ball's thesis and method are apparent from the title.  He sets out to demonstrate how central water is to  our existence and he does so by tracing it's life history from the Big Bang right up to today.  The  broad arc of his story allows him to demonstrate a truly remarkable command of disparate topics,  ranging from Cosmology to History, Geology to Mythology, and Chemistry to Politics.  For someone  with my embarrassingly limited science background, there was a little too much theory to absorb in  one reading, but any technical confusion is more than made up for by the wealth of non-scientific  information he provides.  The book is packed with colorful anecdotes, interesting vignettes and  fascinating factoids.  If it's too much to say that you learn something new on every page, it certainly  seemed to be true.<br />If I have one complaint with the book, it is that Ball has done such a good job of demonstrating how  ubiquitous and remarkable water is, that by the time he gets to the dire environmental warnings about  our wastefulness that conclude the book, it's sort of hard to take them too seriously.  This section also  tends to turn the biography into a bit of a melodramatic cliffhanger.  He can hardly be blamed for not  knowing water's ultimate fate, but there is a certain lack of closure to his tale.<br />There are a number of popular science writers I particularly recommend:  Jacob Bronowski (The  Ascent of Man), Daniel Boorstin (The Discoverers), Lewis Thomas (The Lives of a Cell : Notes of a  Biology Watcher), Carl Sagan (The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the  Evolution of Human Intelligence ), Richard Rhodes (The Making of the Atomic Bomb), Stephen  Hawking (A Brief History of Time: from the Big Bang to Black Holes) and Thomas Kuhn (The  Structure of Scientific Revolutions) have all written classics and among more  recent authors Timothy Ferris (Coming of Age in the Milky Way) and David Quammen (The Flight of  the Iguana : A Sidelong View of Science and Nature) are especially good.

Even your grandfathers probably read at least a few  of them.  But the days when Horatio Alger was one of the most widely read authors in America have  long since passed.  Alger's message--that by dint of hard work, decent morals, good manners and a  hefty serving of luck, any American boy can rise from rags to riches--is so clearly anathema to the  literati that his dismissal by the critics and the continuing refusal to treat his work as anything other  than simple-minded boosterism was virtually foreordained.<br />However, you would think that Alger's novels would warrant greater scrutiny simply for their obvious  cultural impact.  It is not an overstatement to say that it is likely that every significant man of business,  politics, literature and academia in America in the early decades of this century had read the works of  Horatio Alger.  How can you hope to understand these men and the America that they forged if you  ignore the one author who was most likely a formative influence on them?  More than that, it is  certainly the case that except for a couple of decades of despair brought on by the Great Depression, it  is, has been, and seems sure to remain, the uniquely American idea that anyone can succeed.  It is  amazing the number of times you will hear folks  from foreign countries speak about how this  perception of unlimited possibilities is something that you only find in America (Howard Evans on  Booknotes one night springs to mind).  This after all is why we are the one nation that welcomes  immigrants.  Other countries assume that immigrants will just get on the dole and stay there; we assume  they will not only succeed, but will flourish.  Alger is certainly not the originator of these belief, but  his millions of books must have contributed something to this entrepreneurial spirit that informs the  national soul.<br />Besides that, they are just fun.  There is something refreshing about Alger's straightforward,  unmannered writing style.  The mere absence of all of the modern stylistic devices that so often make  reading modern novels a chore, makes reading the books a pleasure.  Besides, who doesn't get a  vicarious thrill reading about a good boy making good.  And, beneath the outer layers of poverty,  Alger's heroes are enormously appealing; here's his description of Richard &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; Hunter:<br />  Dick's appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar. His pants were torn in several  places, and had apparently belonged in the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself. He  wore a vest, all the buttons of which were gone except two, out of which peeped a shirt which  looked as if it had been worn a month. To complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him,  dating back, if one might judge from its general appearance, to a remote antiquity.<br />  Washing the face and hands is usually considered proper in commencing the day, but Dick was  above such refinement. He had no particular dislike to dirt, and did not think it necessary to remove  several dark streaks on his face and hands. But in spite of his dirt and rags there was something  about Dick that was attractive. It was easy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he  would have been decidedly good-looking. Some of his companions were sly, and their faces  inspired distrust; but Dick had a frank, straight-forward manner that made him a favorite.<br />There is a reason that the term &quot;Horatio Alger story&quot; lives on in our lexicon.  The concept touches  something deep within our psyche, confirming something that we desperately want to believe about  individuals and about the type of world and society that we live in.<br />Let the critics ridicule them, but when we stop believing in the power and the truth of the Alger myth,  we will cease to be a great nation.<br />GRADE: Baightforward,  unmannered writing style.

Critics describe her as a  miniaturist, by which they apparently mean that her novels are small sketches of particular aspects of  life.  Offshore, for which she won her first Booker Prize, is a good example of this form.  Based in  part on her time spent living on a barge in the Thames, the novel tells the story of a brief period in the  lives of a group of eccentrics who live aboard ship in Battersea Reach on the Thames.  Actually, it only  barely tells a story, it is more an exercise in establishing characters and a setting than anything else.<br />In order for this to work, you either have to have fascinating characters or a spellbinding setting, she  has neither.  At first, as you're reading, she seems about to update Our Mutual Friend, with it's central theme of people, on the margins of society, living on and off of London's  great waterway.  But where Dickens creates unforgettable characters and plops them down in a  labyrinthine plot, these characters are only mildly amusing and there's virtually no plot.  The other  author who sprang to mind is Joseph Mitchell, the great New Yorker essayist whose works are collected  in Up In The Old Hotel.  He was a master at crafting portraits that were small masterpieces around the  bums and lunatics of New York City, but there are no Joe Goulds in Offshore.<br />This is a quick enough read (my copy is just 141 pages) and there's a periodic chuckle, but I found it  difficult to care about the characters and am mystified by the book's reputation.  One of the obituaries  below refers to Ms Fitzgerald's &quot;remarkable sensitivities.&quot;  I am perfectly willing to concede that I am a  man of severely limited sensitivities and so the fault for my not enjoying the book may well lie with  me.<br />GRADE: C-	2000-10-01

It is marvelous not merely because of the joyful exuberance of Doug's  adventures, nor because it evokes Bradbury's childhood, but because it will bring back memories of  your own youthful summers.  Doug's excitement over a new pair of sneakers, or a dish of ice cream on  a sweltering night, his grandfather's refusal to countenance newfangled grass that doesn't need mowing,  indeed, his sheer joy at the smell of his newmown lawn, all of these resonate in the chambers of the  mind.  The title of the book derives from the dandelion wine that his family bottles at the beginning of  the summer and which will recall the scents and sensations of summer throughout the year.  Likewise,  uncorking this book will summon forth those endless days that you spent playing kick the can or  baseball, cooking out in the yard, emerging from the water smelling of chlorine or brine, riding  bicycles for hours on end, lying in bed listening to West Coast baseball games on the radio far into the  night...  This is a book about the value of traditions and rituals and memories and the golden hour of  youth, before we take on the burden of responsibilities.  Read it for the dual experience of being  transported back to the Midwest of Bradbury's youth and to the halcyon days of your own.<br />GRADE: A+	2000-10-01

Even more amusing is when  they then seek to replace the tenets of the old religion with their own new ones and, in almost every  case, manage to come up with a religion of mere spirituality, devoid of morality.  Todays case in point  is Rapture of Canaan by Sheri Reynolds.<br />Ninah Huff is the 14 year old granddaughter on Herman Langston, patriarchal founder and pastor of  the fundamentalist and Pentecostal  &quot;Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing  Wind.&quot;  Grandfather dominates their isolated South Carolina community of believers, enforcing rigid  behavioral laws and meting out harsh punishments for transgressions, including dunkings, partial  burials, and solitary confinement, while waiting for the imminent Rapture to come.<br />Meanwhile, Ninah finds herself strongly attracted to her prayer partner, James.  Soon they are doing  more than praying and while Ninah is convinced that Jesus is speaking through them (it's not made  clear precisely what teen sex communicates), James is consumed with guilt, even going so far as to don  a crown of thorns, but in his case it's barbed wire and he crowns his other head (ouch).  As the outrage  of the community descends upon them, James kills himself, but when Ninah bears a child, Canaan, who  is born with the palms of his hand fused together, he is accepted as a miracle and the New Messiah.  Ninah and the other women of the group begin rebelling against Herman's rules.  James's spirit visits  Ninah to tell her she's doing fine.<br />Eventually, Herman nearly dies of a stroke, then disappears, convincing the flock that he's been  summoned in the Rapture, but that they've been left behind.  Instead he turns up buck naked after  wandering around in the woods, but Ninah, finally convinced that the group's belief in Herman's  teachings and in the miraculous is unhealthy, snips through the flesh that binds Canaan's hands.<br />As the story ends, Ninah's religious beliefs appear to be vested in the rugs that she weaves, into which  she incorporates items from every day life :<br />  When I've used up all my rags and lies, rope and hair, fabric and love, when I'm out of twine and  my loom is broken and there's still a story in me, that's when I unknot and begin the unraveling.<br />  My rugs are never finished.  I use the same materials to make them over and over again, featuring  something new each time and hearing a different tale.  But sometimes they speak the most wisely  when they are heaps of fibers on the pack house floor, intermingled and waiting.<br />  If I sit with them silent for long enough, they will talk.  Just listening, I can give them tongues.  They will speak like prophets.<br />Just in case you were having trouble following all that--Herman having stood for the Old Testament  God and James and Canaan for Christ (even down to crucifixion imagery and James's  resurrection)--Ninah who started out as Mary has now actually become her own god.  She is the  Creator, World Weaver, Tale Teller, Prophecy Giver in her own world of ruggery.<br />Of course, the main trouble with that is : what does she stand for other than opposition to Herman  (God)?  Sure it's difficult living up to the high moral expectations which traditional religious beliefs  impose, but is her new world a better one?  In an afterword, the author says that she drew the  punishments which Herman orders from various medieval sources and, as intended, they shock our  modern sensibilities.  But perhaps a world where sin is punished so harshly has something to be said for  it.<br />For all the antiquated rules and penalties, the worshippers at the Church of Fire and Brimstone and  God's Almighty Baptizing Wind formed a vibrant and loving community and shared a special cohesion  precisely because deviance from the moral norm was taken seriously and dealt with firmly.  This  helped to make the behavior of others predictable and coherent.  Ninah (well, Reynolds) is arguing for  a world without any restraints on behavior, one in which human behavior is totally unpredictable and  one in which the trust between individuals is inevitably destroyed.  The book ends, unintentionally, on  a perfect note : Ninah sits in silence with her rugs, assuming herself a god, freed from any constraints,  the absolute ruler of her own totally atomized world.  Alone.  But, are we each truly sufficient unto  ourselves, each of us making our own rules?  I think not.<br />GRADE : Deviance from the moral norm was taken seriously and dealt with firmly.

Abandoned by his wife and achingly cognizant of his ownblameworthiness in the matter, Leon Olen takes a $50,000 inheritance and his young son and daughter and opens The House of Gentle Men in 1940's Louisiana.  Guilt ridden men come to the House in order to pay their debt to women by holding and kissing and chastely loving them, but never having sex with them.  Women visit the house seeking this kind of &quot;courtly love&quot; from gentle men.  Mr. Olen envisions a place where:<br /> ...men could live in the service of unkissed, overworked, underappreciated, tired, sad, prematurely gray, widowed, nervously single, despondently married women.  Sad women starving for love, their bodies married to labor.  no longer meant to be seen, but to do.  Now these women finally had a house of their own, fragrant with affection, reeking of ammonia, sitting off the dirt road and surrounded by crape myrtle.  A secret place to which they could flee and be women again, kissed and waltzed against, whispered to, touched with just the fingertips.<br />Olen hopes that by demonstrating his understanding that this is the type of love that women truly seek, rather than the sort of raw carnality that men offer, he will earn a Second Chance and his wife will return to him.  The House is successful on some levels, but townsfolk speak of it's castrated men, Olen's son preys sexually on women who leave the house feeling unfulfilled and it reeks of ammonia because his daughter, obsessed with germs and cleanliness, is continually washing and cleaning the place, waging war on germs as much as her father wages war on virility.  The daughter's only passion, other than cleanliness, is for a mysterious golden haired, impossibly blue-eyed baby she found by an oak stump in the woods, a baby who has grown into an angelic young boy, his tender touch and gentle kisses able to ease the suffering of even the most damaged women who visit the House.<br />Meanwhile, a local girl named Charlotte has been struck dumb after being raped by three soldiers who were out on exercises preparing to go to War.  In the wake of this brutality, following hard on the heels of her young brother accidentally immolating their mother while trying to build a funeral pyre for a pigeon, Charlotte found herself pregnant as a result of the rape.  Unable to face what surely must be a demon growing inside of her, she abandoned the newborn in the woods.<br />These stories intertwine when Justin, a soldier just returned from the War, comes to the House, hoping to expiate a guilt so horrible he refuses to speak of it.  When he does reveal his crime, Mr. Olen is so shocked that he refuses to allow him to join the House and Justin tries to hang himself.  This earns him the right to seek redemption and perhaps inevitably, he ends up with Charlotte, who he recognizes as his victim, though she is not aware of his identity...the story is compelling and I was willing to suspend disbelief.<br />My reluctance to give myself over completely was more a function of the seeming message of the story; I was troubled by the pretty relentlessly negative portrayal of men in the book and by the idealization of women.  The vision of man that is shared by the Olens, their patrons and by the men of the house themselves seems to be at odds with the very nature of the beast.  And, yes, I am willing to concede the beastliness of man.  But, recognizing my own tendency towards misogyny, I've made a conscious effort to read more fiction by and for women in the past year, especially reading group books and Oprah choices (see reviews), and much of it tends to express this sort of anti-male sentiment.<br />Happily, these concerns were addressed in the final quarter of the book as the artificial order that the Olens seek to impose on the House begins to break down.  Relationships between characters become less chaste, more realistic, more truly human, allowing for the possibility of genuine reconciliation and redemption. Simultaneously, Olen's daughter, jilted in an affair of the heart, ceases her cleansing regime; the end of physical sterility for the House accompanying the end of emotional and spiritual sterility for the denizens.  In the final dramatic scenes of the book, with the House being consumed by fire (a more patently male symbol that the feminine water that the daughter had been wont to slather it with), even Charlotte's brother, a suspect in a series of arsons after his unfortunate pyrotechnic experience, is redeemed, realizing that he is a firefighter not a fire starter.<br />We are left with a proper balance restored, with the realization that men contain elements of both gentleness and violence, fire and water, love and hate.  It is the unique mystery of humankind that we, all of us, hold within our nature Justin the rapist, Justin the despairing self-destroyer, Justin the gentle lover of women and Justin the Father.<br />After those initial trepidations, I really liked this book.  The story is beautifully written and filled with ineffable images.  The narrative is somewhat elliptical, doubling back on itself so that events are told and retold from the perspective of different characters.  This is a device that has become familiar, think Pulp Fiction, but the effect here is never confusing and the technique never seems gratuitous.  Best of all, the author brings to her story a clarity of vision and a generosity of spirit that confound easy expectations and make for a really rewarding, uplifting reading experience.<br />Ms Hepinstall and a couple of other authors have recently contacted me and asked if I'd be interested in reviewing their books.  I am grateful that she gave me this opportunity and can only hope that other submissions are equally good.  I wish her the best of luck with the book and fully expect to be hearing more about it.<br />GRADE: Ausly, Olen's daughter, jilted in an affair of the heart, ceases her cleansing regime; the end of physical sterility for the House accompanying the end of emotional and spiritual sterility for the denizens.

But it's pretty slender and just barely worthy of a book length treatment.  It seems  like it would work better as a long magazine article or even as a novel and  it will make a terrific movie. <br />In the latter portion of the 19th  century, when James A. H. Murray faced the monumental task of compiling the  initial version of the Oxford English Dictionary, he sent out a call for  contributors.  One of the most reliable and thorough volunteers proved to  be Dr. William Chester Minor.  But Minor resisted entreaties to visit the  operations of the OED and to partake in the celebrations as volumes were  completed.  The reason for his reticence turned out to be his incarceration  in Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. <br />Minor, an American, was profoundly  disturbed and a murderer to boot.  After some disquieting years of service  in a medical unit during the Civil War, he fixed upon an obsession that  Irishmen wanted to kill him.  His psychoses finally led him to gun down a  complete stranger on a British street and he was institutionalized.   He  eventually spent about 50 of his over 80 years in some form of state care,  where he was continually plagued by delusions that he was being spied upon  and his food poisoned, and at one point he mutilated himself in a fashion  which will have male readers cringing in horror.  Meanwhile, his  incarceration and his educational attainment made him uniquely well suited  to contribute to the mammoth undertaking that was the OED. <br />Winchester  does a creditable job of showing how two very different men were united by  their love of language and learning.  But, there are pretty obvious  dramatic limitations to a true life story that involves one subject who's  institutionalized and another who's writing a dictionary.  Like I said,  it's a pretty slim tale, but it is fascinating.	2000-02-04

Taking advantage of the spiritual swirl of the times, he got  several New York businessmen to join his &quot;kingdom&quot;, which he  established on one of their estates in Sing Sing.  Members of the  patriarchal kingdom followed his word absolutely until sexual scandal and  charges of murder and fraud tore the place apart.  The subsequent trial of  Matthias became one of the first big stories for the emergent penny press,  but he was eventually cleared of all of the serious charges.<br />Wilentz and  Johnson take this extremely minor, albeit colorful, episode from the  American past and try to spin out grand theories from it concerning things  like the social displacement caused by industrialization, the changing  roles of women, religion in general, and so on.  But ultimately, the story  is really only interesting for its most colorful aspects and for the  frisson of recognition it provides as we see parallels to modern  equivalents like David Koresh and Jim Jones.<br />Oh, and there's one other  parallel that the authors could not have imagined when they wrote the  book-- the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.  You see, Wilentz, if memory serves  (see article), was one of the driving forces behind the Potemkin petition  signed by &quot;400 Historians!&quot; averring that the Founding Fathers  never intended impeachment to apply to crimes like obstruction of justice,  perjury, and the like so long as they pertained to the President's private  sexual behavior.  How delicious are the ironies of life.  These smug little  liberal elitist profs set out to write a book about how the poor confused  hoi polloi of the last century were sucked into the scams of charismatic  but fraudulent religious hucksters who preyed on their need for reassurance  in a tumultuous time.  As it turns out, a hundred years from now when  historians write about the huckster in the White House and his scandals,  sexual and otherwise, and about the needy liberals who were willing to  enable his degenerate behavior, Sean Wilentz will get his own footnote or  brief mention as one of the minions eager to cover up or gloss over the  aberrant sexual behavior of his messiah--just like one of the acolytes of  Matthias.  Whichever prophet you follow, you've gotta love a God who  delivers such ironies.<br />The book makes for an interesting if  inconsequential read.  It seems like it would have been better as a journal  article.  Or what would make the most sense, how about a book on why Joseph  Smith, who has a brief cameo here, succeeded so brilliantly in founding the  Mormon Church, while folks like Matthias failed so miserably?  But, of  course, that would require dealing with a successful &amp; still powerful  religious movement, rather than poking fun at a long dead oddball.ns write about the huckster in the White House and his scandals,  sexual and otherwise, and about the needy liberals who were willing to  enable his degenerate behavior, Sean Wilentz will get his own footnote or  brief mention as one of the minions eager to cover up or gloss over the  aberrant sexual behavior of his messiah--just like one of the acolytes of  Matthias.

Ethan Frome is a strapping young New England farmer; like George Bailey he dreams of  becoming an engineer and getting out of his small town.  But circumstances  conspire against him as he is first forced to care for his ailing parents,  then impulsively marries the young woman who was brought in to help his  Mother in her final days.  His wife, Zenobia, proceeds to develop her own  health problems, real or imagined, and Ethan is trapped in a loveless  marriage on a hard scrabble farm that he can not possibly maintain.<br />Then  Zenobia's cousin Mattie Silver, who is destitute, comes to stay with them  and help around the house.  Ethan falls in love with her and she with him,  but Zenobia, realizing that something is going on, determines to send the  girl away.  Ethan struggles against fate, but is too decent to actually run  away with Mattie and leave an invalid wife behind.  Despite which, an awful  tragedy intervenes and warps the lives and bodies of all concerned.<br />This  ineffably sad tale is filled with all the revulsion at convention that we  associate with Wharton and it is also an insidious and subtle attack in the  long American war between the advocates of urban and rural life.  Wharton,  the ultimate chronicler of urban society, marshals everything from the name  of the town, Starkfield, to the portrait of the barren homestead, to the  final image of the shattered family left on that farm, to paint the most  dismal possible picture of rural life.<br />It is a deeply affecting work and  you will not soon forget the heart rending plight of Ethan Frome.	2000-02-03

Upon reflection, I think that, even at his most inflammatory, Malcolm X defied this easy  categorization.  Who is to say that if he &amp; the Black Panthers hadn't  been willing to hold out at least the threat of violence, that whites would  have moved to solve the Civil Rights issues as quickly (relatively  speaking) as they did?  More importantly, suppose the shoe was on the other  foot, if you were a young black man in 1960's America, whose message would  have had more appeal, Martin's or Malcolm's? <br />Actually, I have often  wondered if black America might have been better served by a more violent  tone to the struggle.  Civil disobedience works precisely because it  depends on the fundamental decency of the oppressor and the certainty that  he will yield.  But one result of the yielding party's giving in, is that  they can end up imbued with a sense of their own magnanimity  and sink into  a deceptive mood of self congratulation.  It might be better for the  oppressed if there was more of a sense that they had taken what was theirs,  rather than that it was given to them.  I don't truly know. <br />Of course,  the ultimate historic irony is that King, the peacemaker and  accommodationist, was gunned down by a racist white man, while Malcolm, the  rabble rouser and confrontationalist, was killed by rival blacks.  Reading  his life story, it is hard not to believe that Malcolm X's career was  really just beginning.  It seems possible, even likely, that the inner  peace he had found in the true Moslem religion would have given him the  moral and spiritually grounding which, combined with his oratorical gifts  and incisive intellect, might have lead him to accomplish great things.  <br />Martin Luther King is justly celebrated; he is an easy hero for white  America to embrace.  Malcolm X is more problematic, he has sharper edges,  but is no lessdeserving of admiration and honor.  His life story belongs  on the shelf with Benjamin Franklin and Booker T. Washington and Whittaker  Chambers and the other handful of great American autobiographies of self  made men.	2000-02-03

However, while Richard Wright's classic account of his upbringing in the Jim Crow South remains a powerful  indictment of a system of repression and dehumanization which indelibly  stain's this great nation's history, the book is somehow simply not a  compelling text.  Wright never really engages the reader emotionally nor  wins our empathy.  It's, thus, seems more important as a historical  document than central to the Western Canon. <br />The primary reason for this  is that Richard Wright, as he portrays himself in the book, is just an  *expletive deleted*.  And while it is certainly legitimate to argue that he  is merely a creation of the malignant system of segregation and racial  hatred, the history of the South and of other racist regimes (i.e., Nazi  Germany) suggest that he is not an inevitable product of the system.  The  Richard Wright that he presents is so brutal, bitter and hate filled, that  he is impossible to care about.  He stands in stark contrast to the many  still generous, hope filled, decent people who emerged from this same  oppression (or others like it); people whose positive vision and dream of  freedom brought down Jim Crow within a generation. <br />Moreover, he compares  unfavorably to the survivors of the Death Camps and the Gulag and the other  heinous criminal enterprises of the century, who emerged from experiences  that were at least as brutal and seemingly soul deadening to produce a body  of literature that is instead life affirming.  This is not to suggest that  Wright's experiences and reactions and personal development are unworthy of  notice and study, rather, I would suggest that we have more to gain by  studying Elie Weisel and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Vassily Grossman and  Anchee Min and their like, who have turned similar experiences into a  testament of hope and human dignity rather than one of despair. <br />I knowyou aren't supposed to say these kinds of things in our politically correct  age, but I disliked the Richard Wright of this memoir too strongly to  genuinely care about his life.  And this feeling of disgust towards his  character, allowed at least this reader an unfortunate psychic distance  from the revulsion one should feel towards the circumstances and  environment of his youth.  More troubling though than the fact that I had  this reaction, is that many comments by young readers on the Web and at  Amazon indicate that they shared this reaction.  If the texts that they are  supposed to be learning about Segregation from are instead putting them  off, the way that this one does, that is a serious matter.	2000-02-03

But the sisters will have to battle native  superstitions, a blasphemous handyman, the elements and most of all  themselves if they are to succeed.<br />Rumer Godden was raised in India and  was a convert to Catholicism and her love for, and ambivalence towards,  both of them blend beautifully here. Regardless of the ultimate fate of her  mission, Sister Clodagh's personal journey makes for a wonderful read.	2000-01-08
