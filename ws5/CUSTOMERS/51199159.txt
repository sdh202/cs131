Prior Walter has AIDS, and his lover Louis leaves him because he cannot handle it. Prior is later visited by the Angel, who deems him a prophet, but of what? Louis meets Joe whose marriage is collapsing, and the two find solace in each other. Roy Cohn is one of the most powerful men in America, so he cannot have AIDS because that would be a sign of weakness. Instead, he has cancer. \\"Angels in America\\" is a fantastic meditation on love and politics in the beginning years of the AIDS crisis that still has relevance today with its message of greater love and acceptance.	2004-03-08

Claire Gray is facing the end of her first academic year at Desert Arts College, as well as the probable end of her relationship with her younger leading man, who is set to star in his first feature film. She publicly laments this loss, and quips that she wishes the director dead, so when his body is discovered in her pool after that night's party, guess who's the prime suspect? Briefly reluctant to involve herself in yet another murder investigation, Claire sets out to clear her name and finds that only she actually liked the director, and the list of suspects grows by the moment. Written simultaneously with Craft's stage play \\"Photo Flash\\", \\"Desert Spring\\" borrows heavily from the theater world, and this only cements the lively quality of his storytelling. The book is determined to be both fun and serious, without being dour, and greatly surpassed my expectations.	2004-03-02

Using American iconic figures and the mythologies of horror movies, she explores what it means to survive, whether it's love or captivity or the death of one's mother or our ubiquitous pop culture appetite. By the last poems, like the last girl alive at the end of a slasher flick, we are battered and renewed, with dirt under our nails and a fierce determination to live. \\"Final Girl\\" is an invigorating vision of strength and courage.	2004-03-01

After some time, Oswald confesses his homosexuality and fears losing his new friend, but Imre's own confession changes both their lives. Privately published in 1906 under the alias Xavier Mayne, \\"Imre: A Memorandum\\" is one of the earliest novels with positive homosexual characters, and is especially notable for its happy ending. The story is more of a discourse about homosexuality and serves somewhat as a precursor to the author's later study, \\"The Intersexes\\". In his introduction and through various appendices, James Gifford tells about Stevenson's life, includes some other excerpts from Stevenson's works, and includes a review of \\"Imre\\" from 1907.

Soon Strachey is drawn into a complex puzzle as he becomes determined to prove Billy's innocence. Now if he could just find the young man before it's too late.

Travelling through France and finding the lost writer in a hospital, the young man finds himself seduced further by Paul Michel's sharp personality and sets out to free the man he loves from his physical prison, but what of the writer's mental prison? \\"Hallucinating Foucault\\" is a fiery confession of love between reader and writer, of the allure of the passionately mad, of living beyond consequences.

The story gains national attention and exposure, and inspires lots of women worldwide. The walking women have no knowledge of their effect, and are only out as friends supporting one another. Intimate, glorious, and emotive, \\"The Elegant Gathering of White Snows\\" is a wonderful novel about friendship and personal liberation. Like \\"And Then They Were Nuns\\" by Susan Leonardi or \\"Wanderground\\" by Sally Miller Gearhart, this book is not about the individual characters as much as it is about female friendship and the power of women as a group.	2004-02-06

Mer is a plantation slave and a healer in what is now modern-day Haiti. She is the lover of Tipingee, but shares this love with Tipingee's husband. Jeanne Duval is a former dancer who is now the lover of struggling Parisian poet Charles Baudelaire. In ancient Alexandria, Thais is a prostitute, and her journey will take her to the outskirts of Jerusalem. Through their lovemaking and daily lives, these women host the spirit sometimes called Ezili, who echoes other names. Ezili can influence their actions, although she often is simply witness through their corporeality, even as she flails against her own bonds. Weaving these seemingly disparate threads together, Hopkinson illumines the lives of women as she explores sexuality, transcendence, spirituality, and personal freedom. Much like \\"Godmother Night\\" by Rachel Pollack and \\"The Female Man\\" by Joanna Russ, this novel reaches beyond the confines of genre to sing passionately with new rhythms.	2004-01-21

Embracing a variety of faiths and a range of progressive and feminist doctrines, he shapes a brave redefinition of how to live as gay and lesbian individuals, fully in tune with the concepts of God's whole nature. \\"Gay Perspective\\" is a thought-provoking volume, and is intended as such, to create a discourse for us to express in our relationship with the non-gay world in which we live. I found it quite inspiring, especially in its reaffirmation of simple truths that are easily forgotten in our modern world, and I heartily recommend it to anyone willing to imagine the world as a tapestry of beauty.	2004-01-13

She finds a lively senior citizens community, and begins to settle into this new rhythm. Eldora enters her life, and Ann is instantly smitten. Eldora is a widow living at the farm where she grew up, where also her son and daughter-in-law reside. Ann chastises herself for being attracted to a grandmother, of all things, until a shocking admission by Eldora changes both their lives. Embarking on a surprising love affair in a small town at their respective ages is not something to be taken lightly, and maneuvering settled ways is not easy either. But love can find a way when desire is its strength. \\"Prism\\" is a wonderful romance that explores love and sex after sixty and proves the beauty of life at every age, and the surprises that await.

Casper is poor and the victim of incest. Brendan is the captain of the high school football team, and keeps his being gay a big secret, until he falls for Casper. They struggle through a rough beginning, but eventually they become boyfriends. When their secret gets out, their schoolmates are supportive, but Brendan's parents force him into a mental hospital for treatment. He escapes in time to save Casper from his sadistic brother, but at a terrible price. They flee and scrape by, until they end up in Verona, where they feel finally at peace, until Casper's family reaches him yet again. This is Roeder's fourth book in his gay youth series, and it intertwines with those tales, forming a tightly-fit jigsaw. Unfortunately, the story suffers because of it. As the novel progresses, events become more and more contrived and almost unbelievable. There are several passages of great writing, but the endless clichs and stock characters drown these passages. Plus, the characters of Casper and Brendan are nearly indistinguishable in terms of story voice and actions, only the details of their backgrounds keep them separated in the reader's mind (poor/rich, abused/strong). I wanted to rate the book higher, but the final dozen or so pages reinforced the novel's deliberate lack of reaching beyond the plot's ubiquity in so many stories targeted to gay youth.	2004-01-10

Pat is saving herself for marriage and develops a crush on a man in her office who seems so out of reach. Annice is studying poetry at college, at least until she can get married, but when she meets Alan, their relationship doesn't exactly progress as she hoped. Barby breathes easier now that she's away from home, but feels as though she will always be easy prey for men. When Barby begins a friendship with her boss Miss Gordon, she finds herself awakening to something for which she has no words. In her afterword, Lisa Walker posits \\"The Girls in 3-B\\" within the pulp genre of the 1950s and `60s and details the subversive ways Valerie Taylor undermined the genre by including independent women and wholesome lesbian characters. This book is a shining example of early feminist works that shows the complexities of women's lives in the 1950s, as well as expressing the often-overlooked vibrancy of women's novels.	2004-01-02

They are hired to ferry a long-lost queen home to rendezvous with the King of Barious. Enemies of Barious kidnapped the queen years ago, and they brainwashed her, so she has no memories of anything except for the past few years. When they reach the rendezvous, Drew finds herself enmeshed deeper in this whole drama than she ever wanted, or thought possible, but her unscrupulous instincts surface and she's determined to make it all to her advantage. This rough and rollicking space adventure is a wild ride full of zany characters and wacky incidents. Rosen tells a good story, but unfortunately there are so many grammatical and editorial errors that plague this book, so some readers may be deterred from \\"Queen of Denial\\".	2003-12-21

He's confined at the hospital, pending evaluation, and meets the young and attractive Jonathan. Sparks fly between the two, and Chad has reason to hope, but just what is Jonathan's connection to recent deaths at the hospital? And is Jonathan's story of how his parents died the truth? After the two young men are released from the hospital, they continue their romance, but Chad still has questions, although his life spirals even further out of his grasp before he can figure out who Jonathan really is. Martin is stalking Chad, their estranged mother is dying, Chad really needs to find a job, and danger is lurking just around the corner. \\"The Concrete Sky\\" is a high velocity romance with a bodycount that grabs the reader and doesn't let go until the final pages. The plot does stretch believability and everything isn't explained to a reader's satisfaction, but overall the novel thrills and entertains. It reminded me a bit of such works as \\"Brain and Body\\" by Richard Frost, \\"Through It Came Bright Colors\\" by Trebor Healey, and \\"Prozac Highway\\" by Persimmon Blackbridge, but with a much happier ending.	2003-12-17

Rilke works for an auction house and is called in to take care of a recently deceased man's belongings. He's instructed by the man's sister to privately dispose of what's in the attic. His curiosity is piqued, and he's shocked at what he finds: an extensive erotic library, and a cache of disturbing photos of what appears to be the murder of a young woman. He stumbles about trying to figure out what to do, and slips further into the fringes of a dangerous world through his acquaintances. Meeting pornographers and traffickers and others in the skin trade, Rilke continues his own lonely existence and pines for the alluring young man he meets along the way. Unfortunately, he has also slipped into a web of deceit that might just threaten his life and those he's encountered. \\"The Cutting Room\\" is told with a compelling voice and gives a remarkable portrait of life of Glasgow. I never got a clear idea of why Rilke felt drawn to find about the pictures, and the twist at the end is rather bewildering, but overall I enjoyed this novel.	2003-12-13

This series of potent meditations come from her own life and the challenges she faced after coming out as a lesbian. Dr Youngdahl remains a Presbyterian minister, and this inspiring book celebrates the humbling power of the Holy, as well as reaches toward an encompassing, feminist vision of spirituality and justice. Even as a non-Christian, I found \\"Subversive Devotions\\" quite inspiring, especially when she addressed how to love in one's own fashion without listening to dominating viewpoints (from whatever direction). An amazing little book.	2003-12-12

When the King assigns Ammar a gruesome duty, he sets in motion a chain of events that culminate in his own death, thus leaving Al-Rassan weakened in the eyes of its enemies. In the north, in Valledo, the celebrated military leader Rodrigo Belmonte is exiled by his own king, and journeys to Ragosa, where he and Ammar end up in the service of the same king. Jehane left Al-Rassan due in part to the atrocities attributed to Ammar ibn Khairan, and brings her skills as a physician to Ragosa. The three form a strange alliance, coming from three different religions, and a strong bond of love develops, although only two of the three are available to this passion. Their relationship with each other is the backdrop to the grand political intrigues and rumblings of holy war that soon engulf Al-Rassan and the lands surrounding it. Inspired by medieval Spain, \\"The Lions of Al-Rassan\\" is a historical fantasy with an epic scope. The focus shifts towards the end from the triad to the land of Al-Rassan itself, which I found unsettling and distracting. The story might've been better expanded into two books or so, and thus would have better encompassed the themes Guy Gavriel Kay addresses here. Overall, the book is quite enjoyable.	2003-12-11

With chapters on school harassment, drug abuse, and depression, this book also addresses the negative and sometimes self-destructive behaviors of our youth, but gives hope and tools to help heal these wounds. \\"Always My Child\\" is especially notable for its chapters on transgender issues and multicultural issues that previous guides didn't include. I was also excited about the chapter on youth questioning their sexuality (straight and gay and in-between), and how parents can be supportive in that as well, because this isn't something many acknowledge. Jennings and Shapiro have created a marvelous resource that will help not only parents, but anyone interested in helping our youth, both queer and nongay, create positive lives.	2003-12-11

They are poor and dark-skinned, except for her baby brother, whose skin tells a different story. Her older brother is lively and loves wearing their mother's heels, but he's shipped off to Vietnam. She chronicles her life and the world around her, about how everyone knows if you don't let someone do it to you, you'll never get married. And about how wanting to kiss your best friend and touch her doesn't mean anything, anything at all in this dark and collapsing world. \\"Autobiography of a Family Photo\\" is a spirited, poetic, and dark tale of hope in the strangling grasp of a world without love. It's about that hazy line between courage and obstinacy that few can delineate, and even fewer can balance. This novel is considered one of the 100 Best Gay and Lesbian Novels by the Publishing Triangle.	2003-12-11

The surgeon Handel is running away from the mistake he made on the operating table. Self-named Picasso is a painter whose life has been constricted and nearly destroyed by her family, until her current escape. Sappho has wandered the ages following her poetry and reflecting on her loves and on how the world omits parts of her life. These stories, along with a fourth that is about a prostitute looking for her lover, cohere in Winterson's sparkling language and form a mosaic that explores art and love, living and sexuality, identity and consequences. \\"Art & Lies\\" defies the structure of storytelling and instead vividly illustrates the human condition. I didn't feel that the ending brought the narrative to any sort of completion, but overall I found the book inspiring on several levels.	2003-12-09

The story of her friend meanders through the pathways of Mrs Trollope's own life and adventures, which often take center stage in this jolly and edging-toward-doddering narrative. In this story of two now-forgotten women, we experience the struggles of living in the 1800s and the burgeoning nation of America, and it is all rather delightful, but Edmund White includes more. Through the veil of historical fiction, White contemplates gender inequality, American politics and culture, racial distinctions, and religion, and allows the readers to draw parallels to modern day. \\"Fanny: A Fiction\\" is a conversational, quirky novel that may surprise some readers.	2003-12-04

As traders from the neighboring planet Valedon interact with the Sharers, the seawomen strive to better understand the Valans and travel to Valedon. Merwen and her lovesharer bring Spinel, a young man, back to Shora to exchange knowledge. All too soon, the armies of Valedon arrive on Shora to bring it under their rule, but how can a people who have no comprehension of war or rule submit to this harsh invasion? Merwen wages a peaceful communication with the Valans, but understanding is tenuous for both sides and this strange war escalates beyond the control of either party. Only through a blending of Valan and Sharer ways can this war be stopped before Shora is damaged irrevocably. \\"A Door into Ocean\\" is an expansive ecofeminist feast featuring two radically different cultures trying to find common ground. Not just a dialogue between men and women or between warmongers and peacemongers, this book is a fascinating vision of coexistence in a universe where differences carry more weight than similarities. Rich in philosophy and love, \\"A Door into Ocean\\" is a compelling novel beautifully rendered.	2003-12-04

The twin orphans of Parros, Rinda and Remus, struggle to keep up, but are still young teens. Joined by the mercenary Istavan and the little Sem girl called Suni, they battle the beasts of Nospherus until their luck runs out and they are again captured by the Mongauls. Taken before General Amnelis, they soon learn of the Mongauls other mission: to take the Nospherus lands and eradicate all who stand in their way, including the Sem. How can this small band possibly stand against the Mongaul horde before them? With \\"Warrior in the Wilderness\\", the saga picks up speed and delivers an action-packed episode that ends with a cliffhanger. Kurimoto's simple storytelling style seems to make this more of a young adult fantasy, but the dark and fantastic world where the story takes place fascinates and lures the reader onward.	2003-11-25

Evangeline and Eric flit through a relationship, but drift apart for years, but eventually they find their way back to each other. But can they make it work? Her cousin Harry has a crush on Buck, but he's much older and already has his eyes on another. Following these four people through the various decades as they ebb and flow in their friendships, the novel strives to be like a Southern-flavored \\"Tales of the City\\", but the characters are never deepened enough. There are moments of playful storytelling here, but \\"Goneaway Road\\" meanders a lot and jumps from one point of view to another, and this weakens the narrative.	2003-11-20

He meets another Unicorn named Tacto, and is quickly attracted to the young man, but uncomfortable with the notion of same-sex relationships. As the two young men puzzle out their own relationship and find ways to work together as scientists, they also unravel Tacto's hidden history. \\"A, A\\" is a fantastic romance manga that explores some intriguing questions about love, gender, and sexuality.	2003-11-18

The story, however, felt unfocused. As I delved deeper into the novel, it seemed to become more and more prurient and distasteful, and all without a point. I did stop halfway through, so the final pages might have had something that tied it all together, but I just found that I didn't care about any of the characters. None were likeable, and the strange Tooth Fairy creature just didn't interest me enough to continue. I might pick up another of Joyce's books later though because his writing is magnificent.	2003-10-22

Neill falls deeper into Vince's dark and self-destructive life where he learns about courage, love, and truth, and ultimately finds the strength to tell his own truths to his family. Healey's poetic storytelling beautifully illuminates the romance, but stumbles elsewhere in the novel, creating an uneven path through the story.

His best friend was Hassan, the son of the family servant and a member of a shunned ethnic minority. As the son of a prominent businessman, Amir lived a good life, and yet he was always competing for his father's attention and approval, sometimes competing against Hassan. One eventful night in 1975, Amir makes a pivotal decision, a decision that not only marks his path for years but also destroys their family unit. Eventually fleeing to America with his father, Amir thinks he's run far enough away from his past, until someone from his past resurfaces. \\"The Kite Runner\\" is about fathers and sons, about the power of redemption, about the shining hope of literature.

Including sections from Nestle and Wilchins, who have both already contributed much to the gender discussion already, the book lets those who live in between male and female have a voice. Ranging the length of queer gender from intersexuals to transexuals to femmes, \\"GenderQueer\\" doesn't leave any gender stone unturned, and expands the gay and lesbian rights debate to include gender issues, which the editors feel are at the core of the argument and of the harassment of queers and perceived queers in the United States. I found myself inspired by many of these personal tales, and I found myself reflected there as well. The final essay by Wilchins is especially moving and is the luscious cherry on the delicacies here.	2003-10-09

Bouncing between brutal honesty and passionate embellishing, Zoe tells of her various friends, of falling in love with her gay best friends, of falling in love with boys and girls and what it means, of being outspoken in a world that values not peeking behind the curtain. The book seems staccato, but its actually infused with immediacy in a way that is entirely original and equally derivative.

If he can only get through the trial, he might be able to replicate the experiment and find out what happened to Ponter. \\"Hominids\\" is the first book in the Neanderthal Parallax trilogy, and is full of intriguing ideas about Neanderthal culture, like the separation of the sexes and the apparent bisexuality of most of the citizens. The book is more about humanity than anything, and has a fascinating array of characters, each of which is fully fleshed. This is an excellent story that gives readers much to ponder.	2003-09-29

With clunky dialogue and stale caricatures, \\"Discreetly Dysfunctional\\" preaches about how talking about painful episodes relieves one's emotional and spiritual burden. The novel ends in a stereotypical clich of happily-ever-after for each person, thereby weakening the point of the story with its rose-colored ending.	2003-09-16

Forced to continue this lie, Jackal hides the truth as best she can, but a tragic catastrophe destroys her world and her identity as a Hope.

Through travel to places such as Scotland and Key West, he connects the foreign to the personal and ruminates on family legacy, gay life and literature, and the trials of being a leather bear. Mann is an accomplished writer, and these essays are well written, but certain points are repeated over and over, creating tedium for the reader. And unfortunately, he doesn't elaborate much, so by the end of the book, the reader is not left with a clear picture of the whole man he has become, but rather is only briefly acquainted with the plethora of identity aspects Mann claims. Despite this, there is still much to enjoy here.	2003-09-11

Ten people come to a remote island, all vaguely invited under false pretenses. With their hosts nowhere to be seen, they have a quiet dinner until a disembodied voice accuses each of them of murder. Of course, everyone claims innocence, but when the guests begin to die one by one, the accusations seem to have some merit. And they can only conclude that there is a true murderer in their midst. This mystery is a fantasy about the art of crime, and is one of Christie's more famous ones. It may not be her best book, but it is quite a delightful tale.	2003-09-09

When he begins to fall in love with the mortal, he finds himself at a crossroads that might change the lives of everyone, both mortal and magical. Imagining Shakespeare's inspirations for his famous plays, Sarah Hoyt delights readers with this tale of intrigue, fairies, vengeance, and love.

Florida describes what he terms this new Creative Class, as well as from where it emerged. This Creative Class celebrates diversity and embraces it, and gay communities are the metaphorical canaries in the coal mine because a thriving gay community is an indication of how welcoming a city is to diversity (whether sexual, racial, or national).

Elizabeth's mother has died and her prospects are dim because of her father's debts. She gives nightly ministrations in her bed to her maid, and doesn't look forward to marriage. Jack (born Jacqueline) has been dressed as a boy since a young age, and with a wooden phallus completing her disguise, none of the women she beds knows the difference, and in fact, her reputation as a lover spreads and she finds women lining up at her door. Each was given a special locket by her mother, and these lockets want to be joined back together, and events slowly progress to this rendezvous. Jack eventually ends up on a pirate vessel, where her talents as a lover are again in demand. Elizabeth enters into a marriage of convenience and her path leads her to the same pirate ship and to Jack. They find that the two lockets form a single map to the maligned Mermaid Island, but what will they find when they arrive?

Aubrey is given his first command, a slow brig called \\"Sophie\\" which is unlikely to help him advance in the British navy. With the help of his friend Maturin and the crew of the \\"Sophie\\", Aubrey engages in one battle after another, slowly gaining a reputation and the wrath of the French and Spanish fleets. Now if Aubrey's luck can only hold out as he and his crew are hunted by the best in the Spanish fleet. \\"Master and Commander\\" vividly displays life at sea: the food and weather, the floggings for drunkenness, the severe punishments for sodomy, the great excitement of battle. I fully expected to be daunted by the technical aspects of navy ships, but Patrick O'Brian's masterful storytelling kept me wrapped in the jaunty tale to the end. I am surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel because it's so unlike what I usually read.	2003-08-23

Alternating literary analysis with lively samples, he demolishes the notion of a dearth of gay literature from World War II to the 1969 Stonewall riot. All of the works excerpted here are out of print, and while some may not be to our modern readers' tastes, they are all evocative of gay men's lives at the times, for better or for worse. From insightful drama to hardcore erotica, these books did much to shape America's views of homosexuality, and \\"Pulp Friction\\" whets the appetite and showcases where today's gay literature can trace its roots. Also included is an appendix where Bronski lists a smattering of gay novels published from 1940 to 1969. This anthology is a great introduction to this genre of queer writings.	2003-08-15

When the Fedeli come to the conservatory and execute one of Eliana's friends for apostasy and another friend is taken by the Circle (the powerful mages who govern the land), Eliana learns of the true nature of the famine and decides to return home. Finding her past destroyed, Eliana discovers the old religious ways and ends up in a refugee camp where no one is allowed to leave. She is distracted by her attraction to another young woman in the camp, but she finds herself considered a leader as she helps organize the already-established rebel forces. Now she must overcome her own inexperience if she's to lead. \\"Fires of the Faithful\\" is an interesting fantasy focusing on a young woman coming of age in a war-torn land. There is a lot of religious discourse, as Eliana learns more about the old religious ways and compares it to the Fedeli ways, and it's rather parallel to the Christianity/paganism debate. This can be distracting for some readers, but it doesn't necessarily hinder the story's flow.	2003-08-14

In the ensuing conversation, Proteus admits to being unemployed, which is essentially unheard of and is cause for alarm. Yet Lydian is intrigued, and meets Proteus (whose real name is Merle), who soon confesses a secret. He can change his appearance at will, but he cannot remember what he originally looked like, or whether he was actually male. Merle shares this ability with Lydian, and the two begin a passionate love affair that crosses boundaries of gender and sexuality and that challenges the world in which they live. Yet the world isnt ready for change, and it finds ways to challenge them back, which causes Lydian and Merle to discover more about their world and the essence of love and existence than they originally intended.

Vidal briefly traces our history since our country's beginning to elaborate the pattern our imperial government has followed, and to show how we got where we are today, with Corporate America at the helm of our United States of Amnesia.

Loosely chronicling the last days of a religious cult called the Overcomers, the novel is composed of fragments of the stories of Tanya, who joins the cult as a pregnant teenager, and of Herbert, her son who leaves the cult before its end. Various other characters appear, including two of Herbert's friends and the man who fathered Herbert, as well as the cult leader Martin Jones. Jeppesen's stark style is quirky and noteworthy, but the story threads unravel as the novel progresses, and by the end, the surreal quality of the fragmentary episodes overtakes the book and dilutes whatever meaning readers are supposed to take from it. Despite my problems with this book, Travis Jeppesen is definitely an author with a future.	2003-07-29

Actually, this is all told through the eyes of Lauren's daughter Asha, who, through her mother's journals and teachings, tries to understand the mother she hardly knew. A religious zealot became President of the country, and Lauren's community was destroyed for its heathen views and all the children were placed with other families, so Asha grew up never knowing her mother. Asha weaves together her own story with that of Lauren's struggles to rebuild her Earthseed community, and she tells of how she finally met her birth mother with the unwitting assistance of Lauren's estranged gay brother. The first half of the book is a bleak report of the atrocities done by men to women and by zealous humans in the name of religious beliefs. It nearly overwhelms the story and detracts from what Butler is presenting, but eventually this improves and it becomes the compelling story that it ought to be, although overall it's not as potent as \\"Parable of the Sower\\". Like the first book (and books by Margaret Atwood, Sally Miller Gearhart, and Marge Piercy), Butler expresses a fascinating feminist view of the political, social, and personal turmoil our country faces, and the potential path that could be taken.	2003-07-27

The Mongauls have many enemies, and when the keep is invaded, the three see their opportunity to escape, but the Black Count won't give up that easily. &quot;The Leopard Mask&quot; is great fun. There are a few consistency errors that are not too noticeable (I don't know whether it was from the translation or not), but the fact that my edition was missing about twenty pages towards the end of the book was quite noticeable.

Poppy Z. Brite brings us a Gothic story of two gay men in a Louisiana bayou that is connected to some of her other works. In Michael Thomas Ford's \\"Night of the Werepuss\\", a woman finds that her vagina has literally grown teeth. The stories by Robert Boyczuk, Nalo Hopkinson, and C.

The final story, \\"The Narrow World\\" by Gemma Files, can be compared to some of Clive Barker's work, but with a distinct twist. While I think this volume is not as potent as the first, \\"Queer Fear II\\" is a marvelous companion to it that will send readers off to locate more by these twenty-two authors. \\"Queer Fear II\\" won a Lambda Literary Award, and is a finalist for the Spectrum Awards, honoring the best in gay and lesbian fantasy and science fiction.	2003-07-24

Their love for each other has always sustained them, until Lloyd announces he feels no passion for Jeff anymore. The previous summer, Jeff all but fell in love with a young man named Eduardo, and he still laments losing him. Jeff's best friend Javitz is dying of AIDS, and wants to return to Provincetown for his last days. Alternating from 1995 to the previous summer and back again, \\"The Men from the Boys\\" charts the love lives of these men as they navigate their own definitions of love and family and friends. William Mann includes some sensible commentary about an aspect of gay men's culture, and creates a breezy story around these thoughts. I found myself not liking the main character, Jeff, because he was so obnoxious and narcissistic though, but I was curious enough about where Mann was going with the story to finish the novel.	2003-07-17

What began as well-intentioned modifications have become sometimes ludicrous and often inaccurate texts that bore students with blandness. In order to placate both the religious right and minority groups, textbook publishers have been censoring themselves and no one has really been noticing. Diane Ravitch's insightful critical analysis of this censorship is a breathtaking view of what is happening right now in America, even though it seems to be right out of George Orwell's \\"1984\\". Exploring how this began and the political climate that keeps it going, Ravitch passionately argues for change in this system because of the devastating effects it is causing in today's educational system by sanitizing information and actually hindering learning.	2003-07-12

Harry and his friends know about Voldemort's return, but the rest of the wizard world seems to be determined to discredit Dumbledore and Harry and deny the return of the Dark Lord. There's yet another new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and she's very malicious in her attempts to exert the Ministry of Magic's influence at Hogwarts. There are almost too many plot threads weaving through the book and they nearly bog down the story (Ron on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Harry's first attempts at dating, the looming O.W.L. exams). A major character dies, and unlike in the previous book, the death isn't fully explained or properly grieved, leaving the readers bewildered. Even the dnouement pales in comparison to the previous books. Despite these issues, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" is a great book as it gives us more of Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they mature, support each other, and learn to be wizards.	2003-06-28

Some have come and gone, some have come and stayed, and almost all have been affected by the quiet and steady ways of living at Julian Pines Abbey. These interconnected stories show their diversity: nuns and battered wives, lesbians and straight women, women both celibate and sexually celebratory. \\"And Then They Were Nuns\\" is a witty and gloriously charming novel about these women, and a welcome invitation to a beautiful way of living in spiritual harmony with each other and the world.	2003-06-20

He encounters the Buddha, but is not content with the role of disciple, and so continues on his journey. He learns from everything and everyone: a beautiful courtesan, a merchant, a ferryman, the river. At last, toward the end of his life, he finds the peace for which he'd been searching. Blending Eastern and Western philosophy and spirituality, &quot;Siddhartha&quot; is a deceptively simple fable with a deafening resonance about spiritual exploration. This is a book to savor, to take one's time reading, to enjoy each nuance of phrase.	2003-06-17

Quickly she becomes entangled in the murder investigation as she finds that things just don't add up. As she follows the path, she keeps encountering Ann Alexander, her rival reporter. They still have feelings for each other and despite their professional roles as adversaries, they cannot deny their mutual desire. Both of the murder investigations they are investigating seem to have more in common than they initially thought, but who will scoop the big story first? \\"She Scoops to Conquer\\" is a fun and sexy romantic thriller in what is hoped is just the beginning of a new series.	2003-06-15

His parents were researching a butterfly that had unique genetic mutations, so Prabir was left to his own devices much of the time. They thought they were remote enough to escape notice during the Indonesian civil war, so were not prepared when it reached them. With intense feelings of guilt and of protectiveness toward his sister, Prabir grows up in Canada, and hides all thoughts of Teranesia beneath the everyday rhythms of work and his routine with his boyfriend. When his sister joins a research team sent to investigate the growing number of new species in the remote islands of Indonesia, Prabir can't hold back his feelings of protectiveness and follows her alone. Joining with an independent scientist, he collects evidence of the strange new animals and plants, and faces down his darkest demons when he finally ends up on Teranesia, where it seems the mutation revolution began. Ending on a somewhat mystifying note, &quot;Teranesia&quot; nonetheless is a fascinating and compelling story of a young man journeying into the darkest reaches of himself, all wrapped inside a truly scientific science fiction novel. It's a massively ambitious novel and is largely successful at its aims.	2003-06-13

Richard St Vier is a swordsman at the height of his prowess, hired by lords and ladies to fight duels for honor or for politics. He is the lover of a young and mysterious man called Alec, but he's unsure of where the relationship is heading. When Alec is kidnapped in an attempt to blackmail Richard into taking a job, the swordsman seeks revenge and becomes trapped in a maelstrom of machinations that could prove his undoing or even his death. Alec must make choices of his own, whether to reveal his true identity or not, which might be able to save his lover's life. This complex story is almost too heavy on intrigue because it becomes quite a challenge to remember it all, but it's buoyed by the romantic fantasy world Kushner has created. While I didn't entirely understand what made Alec and Richard stay together, I couldn't help but be caught up in the story to see where it all lead.	2003-06-12

The remaining human population now finds itself as a species with the possibility of extinction as children across the world are dying, seemingly at will. Zude, one of the three magisters who oversee the global government and the peacekeeping Kanshou, finds herself at a point in human history where the next decision is pivotal. With her exlover Jez, she comes to the realization that maybe it is time to dismantle the Kanshou and the various government agencies, what with the threat of humanity's extermination, and of course, this is met with resistance. How can the two women convince the world that it's the right thing to do, when the world as they know it is out of control? Ultimately, a new ability called 'going shy' (not unlike teleportation) leads to a startling discovery and a new hope for our planet Little Blue, if only people can embrace it in time. Unlike \\"The Kanshou\\", Gearhart's focus here is mostly on Zude and Jez, through whom we envision a jarring, yet intriguing world. While still heavy with politics and philosophy, \\"The Magister\\" is also quite compelling as it challenges readers to see life in new ways. I can hardly wait to see where the third book, \\"The Steward\\", takes us!	2003-06-08

Her knowledge of the Old Testament is clear here, and it more than enhances these poems. It gives them an added grace and strength.

He reaches out to Clara, who helped him get through his brother's death years before. Will is eventually contacted by Marie's children, Peter (Will's ex-boyfriend) and Grace (who's dying of cancer), and the four adults soon come together to await news of Marie's whereabouts. Peter and Will still love each other after all these years, and they slowly reconfigure their new relationship. Each character is mired in the past, and there are numerous flashbacks exploring this, which all grow distracting and tedious as the novel progresses. The reader cannot help but care about these rambling people though, and is treated to a good story to find out how it all ends.	2003-05-24

Weaving excerpts from works by Leonardo da Vinci, Plato, Wordsworth, and others, including her own previous work &quot;On Photography&quot;, she leads readers on a journey into our own psyches and ways of thinking and viewing the world, and pushes us to examine with conscious knowledge the usage of images. I was especially taken with the idea that it is entirely human to turn away from these pictures of suffering, which are often used as a form of entertainment in the modern world. Sontag rightfully doesn't offer answers or platitudes, but instead indicates a welcoming of our own humanity's foibles as a way to deal with the obligations of conscience and the limits of sympathy.	2003-05-21

Behrman's vast mania obscures his depression and disconnection with the world and permits him to function in a slew of occupations: filmmaker, art dealer, stripper at a gay bar, public relations agent. His mania also leads him on a hazardous journey through substance abuse in the grandest sense and through ultimately unsatisfying (bi-)sexual adventures. While it gives a compelling portrait of struggling with a mental illness, the book doesn't seem to have a point beyond being a document of Behrman's raging manic depression. It ends up being like a reality television show in book form: fascinating for some and tedious for others.

Committing a terrible crime, he flees to Toussaint's dark sister New Half-Way Tree, and takes Tan-Tan with him. Tan-Tan and her father settle among the other criminals and aliens in a small settlement run by a bisexual warlord. When her father crosses the line too far in his abuse of her, Tan-Tan embraces the spirit and lore of the Robber Queen and fights back. Fleeing for her life, she lives among the aliens they call the douens, where she slowly heals and tries to find herself. As her past stalks her present, Tan-Tan is forced to choose whether to fully embrace the lore of the Robber Queen if she's to have a future of any sort. Taking the rhythms and patois of Caribbean literature and setting them in the realm of science fiction, Nalo Hopkinson has created an intriguing tale of a young woman healing her scars and finding inner strength. While this is not a new story, the details and storyweavings are, and those are the strong points of &quot;Midnight Robber&quot;. The circular storytelling was distracting for me, as were some of the meanderings into Tan-Tan's daily struggles to survive. What kept me going was not only the science fiction world Hopkinson created for this story, but also the idea that storytelling would set Tan-Tan free.	2003-05-15

Linking various accounts of torture and imprisonment from around the world with analyses of world culture, Kate Millett explores where cultural permission begins that allows these sorts of atrocities to occur. From Nazi Germany to South Africa, from South and Central America to Ireland, she shows how similar the experiences of those captured and tortured are throughout the world, and since this has all happened during the last century, it is all the more chilling, especially in the light of recent world events. With her compelling mixture of the personal with the political, Millett holds up a mirror to our American complicity in these crimes and challenges us to do something about it, if nothing else but to not be silent. Published almost a decade ago, \\"The Politics of Cruelty\\" is still timely and important because these sorts of occurrences have never ceased. They just are better hidden. Millett's ninety-year-old mother is quoted at the end in the acknowledgments as saying, \\"I am not sure I wanted to know this much before I died... but then, imagine what they knew.\\" Such a truth ought to not be overlooked.	2003-04-11

Mark and June are rather alike in that they are both looking unsuccessfully for love. Being gay in the late 1920s is terribly difficult, and Mark struggles with self-hatred instilled in him by society. Even though it portrays society's many prejudices and negative expectations for gays at the time, and the standard-for-the-era tragic ending for the homosexual character, \\"Strange Brother\\" reaches for compassion, understanding, and acceptance. It does somewhat succeed through the character of June who realizes her commonalities with Mark, and chooses to embrace life fully, even after the death of the object of her own affection (not Mark, by the way). \\"Strange Brother\\" is a wonderful story giving readers a glimpse into the early days of moving towards acceptance of gays and lesbians.	2003-03-29

Those remaining Shaftali paladins have grouped together as a guerrilla army to do what they can against the mighty Sainnites. Zanja is the last survivor of a peaceful tribe eradicated by the Sainnites, and her fire witch powers give her glimpses into the future. Emil is a paladin and also a fire witch, but his powers make him more of an excellent judge of character, although working in tandem with Zanja brings luck. Karis is an earth witch whose powers are stifled by her drug addiction, but she can't help but be drawn inexplicably to Zanja. The two women find events moving beyond their understanding and between them, they might just be able to save Shaftal, if they can save themselves first. Peppered with political intrigue, powerful magic, and personal struggles, \\"Fire Logic\\" wants to be a potent story, but it just doesn't make it. The first eighty or so pages flit through fifteen years of story, and this disconnected feeling never disappears. The love stories (between Zanja and Karis, between Emil and a young man who's a Sainnite) are told to us, more than shown, so we never fall in love with the characters as they fall in love with each other. The complex characters and the fascinating magic-laden world kept me reading and interested, and for that the book is recommendable, but overall it lacks.	2003-03-22

There are a lot of brilliantly written passages where Weston reminisces, letting his mind drift from memory to recipe, and these moments are captivating. The fictional stories interspersed throughout, however, abruptly confuse the reader. The ingredients seem to all want to mix together properly, and at moments they almost achieve their purpose, but ultimately, by the final pages, they flop. Weston flips through his life's memories and doesn't share enough with the readers for us to understand the course of his life. He mentions having children, and briefly references Jim, his companion of over thirty years, but the threads connecting his life after childhood are meagerly explored. I wanted to like the book more, but I was left bewildered and wishing for more from &quot;Dining at the Lineman's Shack&quot;.	2003-03-20

Phil and his fellow teachers at a third-rate private school find themselves involved in a quest to save one of their students from a powerful entity whose intentions are unknown, but it certainly can't be good, what with all the dead bodies in its wake. All is not what it seems with the Spark Lords, because they have knowledge of this entity but they won't share, but then, Phil and his friends aren't what they seem either. Gardner's vibrant style is here, but it comes out muted. And as the book progresses, the plot feels more and more contrived. I like how elements of sword-and-sorcery fantasy were blended with science fiction, and Gardner's sense of humor is always great, but overall &quot;Trapped&quot; isn't as great as his other books. Still worth reading, but just don't expect much.	2003-03-18

Her early life is almost idyllic, until the loss of her beloved mother. Manuela latches onto the mother of a boy who's courting her, and is devastated when she's sent off to boarding school by her father. Soon Manuela becomes enamored with one of the instructors, Frulein von Bernburg, and finds her true nature awakening. Playing the male part in a school play gives Manuela strength to declare her love for Frulein von Bernburg, but this brings about her downfall. The movie \\"Maedchen in Uniform\\" centers only on the events at the boarding school, and actually has a different ending. One of the earliest of the lesbian schoolgirl novels, \\"The Child Manuela\\" is one of the 100 Best Gay and Lesbian Novels, as selected by the Publishing Triangle.	2003-03-14

In 1960, as the age of McCarthy's witch-hunt mentality drew to a close, Arvin and his friends were targets of a police raid, where relatively mild homoerotic materials were seized. The men were arrested and accused of having a \\"smut ring\\", leading to their felony convictions, as well as the loss of their jobs and the shame of being revealed as homosexual in 1960. Werth's biography is not only about Arvin's personal and literary life, but is also about America at this time, the puritanical crusades it supported, but which proved their own undoing. Werth's writing is a bit dull during the first half, but as it progresses, and Werth explores Arvin's life in relation to his friends (including his once-lover Truman Capote) and to the world, it becomes a fascinating story of a man who fell from grace, but who didn't let it destroy him. Not only is this a compelling sliver of gay history, but it also showcases the lives of intellectuals in a country where intelligence is progessively devalued.	2003-03-12

The two become lovers, but Lore wants legitimacy and to heal from her various wounds (her past with her family, her weeks with the kidnappers), so she leaves, taking a new identity, and tries to fit in. Ultimately, Lore cannot run from her demons forever, and she must either choose to stay in the shadows or to face the truths of her past. Set in the not-so-distant future, &quot;Slow River&quot; weaves Lore's pasts and present together into an astonishingly compelling tale. At the heart of the book is the story of a young woman healing from abuse, and the science fiction aspects are simply the setting and enhancing details. &quot;Slow River&quot; is the type of book that transcends whatever genre in which it's placed: it's more than a science fiction story, more than a coming-of-age story, more than a lesbian love story, more than a story of healing from abuse. This is a book that makes one believe in the power of fiction.	2003-03-09

She and her best friend Victoria both have a fierce love of horses, so when a horse Victoria considered buying is brutally murdered, Jane can't help but get involved in the investigation, especially since the police aren't doing anything. All too quickly, Jane is hurled into danger. The trail takes her to Montana, where she encounters a strong woman who helps her in more ways than one. Overall, the story and characters would've benefitted from more exposition. It seemed like I was being hurried through the book so Jane could get on with things, whereas I would have much rather lingered. &quot;Night Mare&quot; is an exciting adventure that leaves the reader begging for a sequel.	2003-03-05

During her freshman year in high school, one of the other girls asks her if James and Link are a couple, and suddenly things begin to change: for Ellen, for Link, for James, for their families. Exploring the gray areas between gay and straight, \\"My Heartbeat\\" is an exceptional story aimed at a young adult audience, but certainly deserving a larger audience. Freymann-Weyr's writing is lush without being too flowery, sparse without telling too little. She tells us a lot through this tale, and \\"My Heartbeat\\" shines because of it.	2003-03-05

A few years later, he's rescued by a religious group called the Children of Irfan when it's discovered he's one of the telepathic Silent. Taking the new name Kendi, he begins training on the planet Bellerophon, where a serial killer is killing women in the Dream, the non-physical place where the Silent congregate. When Kendi witnesses the killer at work, he can't help but be part of the investigation, especially while his teacher is one of the investigators. To make things even more complicated, Kendi finds himself attracted to his teacher's son. What if he's rejected once again? But then, what if he's not? As a prequel to Harper's first novel &quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Nightmare&quot; fills in parts of Kendi's past. The mystery plot is unexceptional, and almost easily figured out, and the abrupt jumps through time nearly shatter the plot threads, but Harper's strong characterizations and engrossing sci fi world make this book hard to put down. I can hardly wait for the next novel about the Silent Empire, not only because of Kendi, but also for the intriguing social commentary at which Harper hints via the Dream.	2003-03-02

After the exciting match, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione hear some rumors about events at their school for the coming year, but they have to wait until the start of school to find out specifics. Harry just wants to be a normal young wizard, but You-Know-Who and his followers are lurking on the horizon, and they bring danger to Harry in ways he never imagined. Building on her previous three novels, Rowling outshines herself in this fourth book. While it is darker and a bit more serious than the previous books, \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" is also well-balanced and fiercely true to its audience. I continue to be amazed at Rowling's storytelling prowess. I could hardly put the book down (which I did have to do because it was too heavy) while reading.	2003-02-28

Soon the two are drawn into the racially-charged, secretive town's web as a young woman disappears. Every denizen of the town, whether from the poor black side of Galatia or the slightly more wealthy white side of Galatea, holds a secret or a sliver of one, and this immense pile of kindling nearly destroys the town. Sowing his novel's field with seeds of Southern literature, social commentary, and intriguing observations, Peck cultivates what he hopes is a lush and vibrant garden, but it doesn't reach fruition by the final pages. Too many story seeds and too many quirky elements (the constant unique names, for one), which all are invigorating at the beginning, soon become monotonous. I felt trapped by the story, held hostage, and while the story compelled me to the end, I didn't feel fulfilled by it. Several passages could have been edited out of the novel, and this might have created a tighter, brisker story. Overall, it's a fascinating mystery set in a small town, but the horizons it reaches for are not reached.	2003-02-19

Weaving the variegated stories of a cast of characters, \\"The Exquisite Corpse\\" is a surreal tale of loneliness that paints vivid episodes, but doesn't seem to give a sense of wholeness, of completion to its tapestry. It's a bit like the energetic style of William Burroughs, but without the cohesion (for lack of a better term) his books contain. Yes, \\"The Exquisite Corpse\\" is quite fascinating and compels the reader on, but by the final page, the reader watches as the story flits away without leaving any imprint in the reader's mind.

When one of Rita's friends manipulates Josh into having sex with her and then later accuses him of rape, it sets in motion a chain of events where the secrets Josh keeps about his exact relationship with Thomas are revealed, and no one's lives are unaffected. What begins as an intriguing tale about a man running from his past and memories becomes a tawdry soap opera story that stretches beyond the limits of what a reader can accept.

Insightful and sensuous, \\"Trio Sonata\\" is a beautifully written novel that unfortunately has a glaring flaw. Most of the novel is told in the third person point of view, except in the several flashbacks into early experiences by Janna, Philip, and Alex, which are all told in the first person point of view.

Blending the stories of a day in each of the lives of three women, &quot;The Hours&quot; evokes how intertwined human lives are and how much impact each moment can have. The novel opens with Virginia Woolf's suicide in 1941, but then backtracks to the day she begins writing &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;, which is the first of her great works. Another story is post-World War II where a woman is reading &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; and is discovering her crisp life to be utterly constricting. The third story is a modern retelling of &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;. By contrasting the deaths in the story with the minutiae of daily existence, Cunningham inspires the reader with the often-overlooked beauty that surrounds us. One cannot help but fall in love, as Cunningham has, with Virginia Woolf and her brilliant mind.	2003-01-30

They elaborate on how our human brains resonate with those with whom we are close, thereby ensuring our mental health and giving us positive feelings. Humans are not meant to be solitary. And by extrapolating these ideas, among others, into daily lives, the authors explain how relationships work biologically, how parenting affects a child's brain in early development, and how our modern society and culture is actually dangerous for our health. &quot;A General Theory of Love&quot; is an insightful, accessible look into the psychobiology of love. This is one of those books that will essentially change the way a reader perceives the world and humanity.	2003-01-23

While mostly about the struggle of the two brothers to reconnect after years apart, the book also deals with the legacy of the Holocaust, the impact of family secrets, and the essence of family. For me though, it is the story of the two brothers that resonates so clearly and brilliantly. And by having the brothers be so similar and yet so different, Lowenthal presents the reader with a fascinating portrait of what could almost be two halves of a whole: one man trying to bring together his sexuality and his religious beliefs. Even without this context in mind (whether it's intended or not), \\"The Same Embrace\\" is a marvelous, insightful, and ultimately joyous story that expands past the genre distinctions of Jewish fiction and gay literature to a wholly American novel of family.	2003-01-18

And when Nora begins another affair, Fern is first to figure it out and leaps at the chance to judge her mother, but as events progress, she begins to realize her mother is human after all. And with Lucky dying, both mother and daughter come to better understandings about themselves and their relationship with each other. \\"Lucky in the Corner\\" is full of glorious complexities about us humans, and Anshaw has written this tale in a tidal mosaic, where episodes from the past and present interweave, blessing the reader with all aspects of these fascinating characters and leaving us with a sense of what family (especially those extended families of non-blood relatives) means.	2003-01-02

Intersexuality is the more preferred term than hermaphroditism. Intersexed babies are those born with genitals that are not as easily identifiable as either male or female, so doctors and surgeons perform often unnecessary and traumatizing surgery to force the baby to conform to what society and the medical community believe the standards to be. Bloom ultimately finds that our notions of what is normal are very constrained, and are much more variegated than the general population believes. By getting beyond the medical and technical jargon and interviewing the people in these categories, she discovers that even in minority groups like these, there are differences between the individuals, so she must dispel her own expectationss about commonalities within minorities. &quot;Normal&quot; is a wonderful introduction into understanding the human varieties on the margins, as well as understanding what is normal.	2002-12-31

Together they face each struggle with love and faith, and find their marriage strengthened. At least, that's the book Morgan apparently meant to write. Instead, \\"Gap Creek\\" is a monotonous, aggravating, tedious work that challenges the reader's tolerance. Julie and Hank have a relentlessly hard life, and their relationship is never fully developed. We're told they love each other, and yet it's never fully expressed for the readers. Morgan does have a gift with descriptions of the landscape and the daily grind of farm work, all of which are painstakingly portrayed in beautiful prose. Unfortunately this is drowned in a patchwork tale of unlikeable characters that just never seems to end. It's just one calamity after another, pummelling the readers into a daze. And Morgan overuses the word 'said' to an amazing degree, which makes one wonder whether his editor was paying any attention at all. As mentioned, there are moments of beauty in this book, but they are few and very far between.	2002-12-30

Incorporating aspects of Kahlo's life into meditations on suffering and pain as art, these poems weave a tapestry of Kahlo's artistic mind, which was deeply affected by her physical ailments that persisted throughout her life. This is not a biography, but rather a side dish for readers enthralled by Kahlo's (or Maso's, for that matter) powerful art.

Clara is hiding a secret about the death of her own son back in Jamaica, and David is determined to find out what it is before he loses her from his life. \\"Clara's Heart\\" is a big-hearted story that has great moments of comedy that nearly get lost in the maelstrom of melodrama.

Since then, Edward has been kept by the Fleet on an observation post orbiting Troyen. When a ship finally picks Edward up for the trip home, the entire crew are executed for crimes by the fabled League of Peoples, who govern the whole of outer space. Edward finds himself at the heart of a growing conspiracy which threatens his own life as well as the whole of the Mandasar people, and he feels he's in way over his head. Luckily Explorer Festina Ramos arrives, but there are also secrets that Edward is keeping, so maybe getting help to solve this mystery wasn't such a great idea after all. James Alan Gardner's fourth book \\"Hunted\\" is one of the best in the series. With compelling characters (including the legendary Ramos) and an engrossing mystery plot, this science fiction story zips through every twist and turn, refusing to let the reader go until the end. And what an end it is!	2002-12-12

She interviewed a wide variety including Margaret Rawson (a world-renowned expert on dyslexia), Ruth Ellis (the oldest living lesbian), Sadie and Gilbert Hill (married for over eighty years). At first, Ellis is focussed on the historical aspects of their lives, but soon finds herself on a personal journey of her own, where she connects to them as individuals alive in the world and begins to see how looking forward, not backward, is a secret to longevity, as is living in the here and now. More of a story of Ellis herself than the centenarians she met, &quot;If I Live to Be 100&quot; is a surprisingly luminous memoir that charms the reader and opens the mind to what it means to be really alive.	2002-12-11

From young to old, from previously published to new for this book, from established writer to beginner, \\"Found Tribe\\" has something for almost everyone, even the non-Jewish. Sometimes humorous, but always poignant and informative, these essays explore how these Jewish men blend their religious lives with their personal lives when many would use that same religion to condemn them. Schimel is an amazing writer and anthologist who continues to bring thought-provoking works to the public, and this book (despite its minor plague of editorial misprints) surely enlightens. Even those who are not Jewish or even gay can benefit from the honesty, humanity, and self-liberation contained in these essays.	2002-12-07

In this first book, Kate is hired by a famous musician to find his long-lost lyricist Moira. She succeeds in tracking Moira to her girlfriend's house, and thinks all ends happily ever after with the reunion, until Moira is murdered in the musician's house. Now Kate is pulled into the murder investigation, and finds more suspects and motives than she anticipated, all the while dealing with her job as a private investigator and with a distracting boyfriend. \\"Dead Beat\\" is a marvelous introduction to the series and showcases McDermid's talents as a mystery writer.

Jeremy is a graduate student studying the Amish community and its concept of shunning those who break their strict religious codes. His own community will always be Ironwood, the all-boys' summer camp in Vermont where he's evolved from camper to counselor to assistant director. He falls under the seductive charms of a fourteen-year-old boy, who later accuses a member of the staff of molestation. Jeremy is forced to face not only his own sexual confusions, but also the dark secrets of Ironwood that he's struggled to forget and that will also chart his future path. \\"Avoidance\\" is a potent blend of masterful storytelling and arresting characters which will not leave readers unaffected.	2002-12-04

Eldon Dashell dreams of becoming a great cartographer and explorer, and Isabelle Dashell is determined to create her art through photography, in spite of the ridicule she receives from her peers. Isabelle uses Annie as a model, and the young woman quickly becomes her muse, inspiring her to greater heights with her portraits of Guinevere, Ophelia, Sappho, the Madonna, and other iconic images. Annie also connects with Eldon and his fascination with Sir John Franklin's disastrous Arctic exploration, and she becomes a catalyst for transformation for everyone in the house, including herself. Annie has awoken the passions of Isabelle, and the sudden flames burst through their love triangle and prove the undoing of all. &quot;Afterimage&quot; is a luxurious novel about awakening, love, art, and freedom in a time when nothing seemed possible. It's as if Charlotte Bront's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; were mixed with Sylvia Brownrigg's &quot;Pages for You&quot; to create a unique, moving story.	2002-11-30

Yagharek is a garuda who's been judged and lost his wings. He comes to New Crobuzon to find a rogue scientist named Isaac who might be able to help him gain flight again. Isaac is prone to obsessions, and takes on Yagharek's case with gusto. One of his lab specimens is a colorful caterpillar, and when this caterpillar emerges from its cocoon, it sparks a chain of terrifying events that affects not only Isaac and everyone he knows, but the entire city itself. Isaac, Yagharek, and their compatriots find themselves the only defense, and make their stand at Perdido Street Station. The novel is a gorgeous and voluptuous tale that builds upon its layers, building into an enthralling mixture of fantasy, politics, science, horror, and metamorphosis. Miville's writing does stumble in places, and sometimes the story seems to ramble, but this does not take away from the sheer majestic scope of &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot;, nor from the reader's enjoyment. By the final pages, each character transforms and the reader is left astonished and amazed.	2002-11-28

Faye helps care for the patients, and is a witness when her father finds a cure. After her father's mysterious death a few days later, Faye drifts through life, enters into a group marriage (her culture is bisexual), and eventually becomes a member of the Vigil, a watchdog group who fiercely monitor the government. On her first assignment, her partner is killed and Faye finds herself fleeing not only the assassins, but also a couple of government agents who feels she is hiding something. With the help of her new Oolom partner and of Festina Ramos (from Gardner's first book \\"Expendable\\"), Faye sifts through the mystery of this multilayered conspiracy which is connected not only to Demoth's past before the Ooloms arrived, but also to Faye's father. Now if Faye could only stop being distracted by the enigmatic Festina, so she could concentrate on surviving... \\"Vigilant\\" starts slow, but after the arrival of Festina, the story flares to life and the reader can hardly read quickly enough.

Beginning in the late 1930s, young Dorothy Tipton began a transformation of herself that deceived almost every person who encountered him in later life, including some of his ex-wives and his adopted children. &quot;Suits Me&quot; brilliantly vivifies this extraordinary life, giving the readers the context and the background of what might have led Dorothy to become Billy. Taking her cues from Billy himself, Middlebrook does not portray her subject as a lesbian or a transgendered person or a crossdresser, but rather as a person determined to be a successful jazz musician, but who ultimately walked away when the spotlight became too bright to conceal the charade. &quot;Suits Me&quot; is a masterful biography that educates readers not only about its subject, but also about social constructs of gender, and leaves readers astounded.	2002-11-16

Jeannine is a librarian in a world where the Great Depression has never ended. Joanna is living in the 1970s in a world much like our own. Janet is from a lesbian utopia called Whileaway, where only women exist. The fourth woman is from a future where the men and women are literally warring with each other. Russ uses these women to express and explore notions of gender, sexuality, politics, and human rights in a unique style incorporating a quirky (and somewhat dated) sense of humor. While it may not have the immediacy of \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" or \\"Woman on the Edge of Time\\", \\"The Female Man\\" stands alongside such feminist works such as \\"Les Gurillres\\", where it challenges how a story is told and gives the reader a refreshing view of what the fantasy/sci fi genre can be.	2002-11-15

There is a regiment of Canadian soldiers on the estate as well and Gwen finds herself drawn to their commander, Captain Raley, but what is it she feels? What is love exactly to someone who has never felt its essence? Raley himself is adrift as he mourns the loss of his best friend. Gwen finds a hidden garden on the estate and by bringing it back to life, she finds her own journey mirroring the flowers. It is a journey of blossoming through longing, to love, as the war in Europe looms and Gwen's love for Raley may actually be doomed for reasons she never considered. \\"The Lost Garden\\" is a joyous bouquet that is both patient and anxious, and whose scent will linger in the hair and clothes of every reader.	2002-11-07

Finding a lack in their relationship, each begins an affair, and eventually their respective girlfriends (Chantal and Mouse) move into the large house with them. The initial tensions and aggravations eventually give way to a sort of bonhomie as the four non-Americans plan and give a large party. It's an intriguing novel about foreigners in America, whose third part shines with Porter's writing. The earlier portions of the book, however, contain awkward dialogue and a torpid story which almost swallows the characters whole. &quot;Resident Aliens&quot; is a challenging book about the maturation of love between these four people.	2002-11-06

Eleres has never been comfortable with this nature, and his sister Mevennen is one of the landblind, those who are not connected as others are. She is considered a ghost, a being not really of the world and worthy only of being destroyed, and Eleres has always protected her from harm, including from his male lover. When Mevennen herself sees other ghosts, she is confused, especially when they tell her they are not actually ghosts, but from another planet and they would like to help heal her. The mysterious visitors have come to investigate why the original colony from their matriarchal society became the animalistic people they are today, and possibly find a way to fix them to be like themselves again. By attempting to help Mevennen, the visitors divide on how best to do it, and ultimately this proves to have more consequences than anyone anticipated. &quot;The Ghost Sister&quot; is highly fascinating and poses many compelling ethical questions about human nature. And while the story does move along at a brisk pace, it bogs down through much of the center of the novel into a tedious anticipation of what the outcome will be. This can be aggravating for readers. Williams does include many asides which elaborate on the native culture and from where the visitors came, all of which may interest readers and does keep one continuing to the end. Overall it's a great book that will give readers much to ponder and will intrigue us to look for another work from the author.	2002-10-28

While Raheim is away in California filming a movie, Mitchell is constantly tempted by other African American men he meets. And when he keeps running into the openly bisexual Montee in various places, Mitchell finds his commitment to Raheim exceptionally challenged. While Hardy's characters and his writing remain strong, he dilutes this novel with many diatribes and detours which give the book a disconnected atmosphere. I believe all of what Hardy wants to convey through this novel has merit, but by not weaving it seamlessly through Mitchell's struggles to remain true to his Pooquie, he ultimately leaves the reader disappointed in some respects. After the stellar &quot;The Day Eazy-E Died&quot;, &quot;Love the One You're With&quot; is a bit dim, but still worthy.	2002-10-21

He has a marvelous girlfriend and a promising future, but he also has a few so-called friends who wish him harm. A seemingly-innocent promise made to a dying teacher combined with a mean prank on Ned avalanches into a series of events that lands Ned on a remote island as a sort of political prisoner. Separated from all he's ever known, Ned nearly descends into insanity, until a fellow inmate befriends him and helps him to find a way to escape. And he does so, in order to revenge himself on those who destroyed his life. Originally published in England under the title \\"The Stars' Tennis Balls\\", \\"Revenge\\" is a retelling in a way of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". Fry's writing here is enthralling, and while I do like his \\"Making History\\" better, this book is worthy of recommendation for its potent renderings of the nature of vengeance.	2002-10-12

Louise DeSalvo has pieced together this first manuscript to offer the public a glimpse into the early creative mind of Woolf. Following the same basic plot as \\"The Voyage Out\\" (a young woman's journey to sexual and emotional awakening), \\"Melymbrosia\\" is much more frank in its portrayal of politics and sexuality (including homosexuality). Another difference is the raw and unpolished feel that this early draft contains. DeSalvo chose to retain some of Woolf's errors in this version, and while this doesn't necessarily detract from the story, it does make the reader wonder about their inclusion. \\"Melymbrosia\\" is a fascinating and powerful look into Virginia Woolf's early writing and life that conveys the passions she felt for all aspects of life, which she felt she needed to mute to some degrees in order to gain acceptance.	2002-09-25

The Pandorans want to keep their planet pristine, so with the threat of invasion if they fail, they begin genetic experiments to find the cure. Helice Trust's genetic make-up is perfect for the experiments and the Pandorans eventually manipulate her into volunteering to bear the child they've created. The experiment turns out to be worth killing for, and Helice's two daughters Chena and Teal find themselves equal targets. Five years later, Chena and Teal are fugitives from the Pandoran scientists who are determined that they should take their mother's place. But there are other forces at work on Pandora that could be either friend or foe for the two teenagers, so whom can they trust? Zettel's novel is a compelling and fast-paced read that poses several intriguing ethical questions. While the five-year jump between parts one and two is quite jarring, it does make some sense for the story. And the ending is almost too tidy, but this doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment of \\"Kingdom of Cages\\", which ultimately is quite entertaining and thought-provoking.

Maple finds an ally in fellow schoolgirl Wild Ginger, whose foreign-looking eyes make her also a target of the school bully. In efforts to prove herself and to separate herself from her heritage, Wild Ginger embraces Maoism to the utmost and dedicates her life to it. When she meets a young man who also embraces Maoism fervently, Wild Ginger chooses to stifle her burgeoning passions rather than challenge Mao's proclamation against romantic love. As Maple and the young man are drawn together by their mutual love of Wild Ginger, it sets the stage for doom for one of the three. \\"Wild Ginger\\" is written subtly and dreamily, where the bright colors of love are muted as they would be because of the Cultural Revolution of the time. And while this might give some readers a sense of distance away from the characters, it also strengthens the grand context of the personal confusions brought on by the Maoist doctrines.	2002-09-14

She turns heads and wreaks havoc all in her efforts to get where she wants to be. Myra takes no prisoners in any venture, especially in terms of sex. When Buck confronts her with the lack of evidence of her marriage to Myron and of the demise of Myron, Myra is forced to reveal her true nature. Ultimately Myra gets what she wants, but not in the way she planned, after a hit-and-run accident nearly destroys her. Challenging the 1960s' attitudes about gender and sexuality, \\"Myra Breckinridge\\" is not as scandalous now, but it's still shocking and campy. This is #23 of the 100 Best Gay and Lesbian Novels, as selected by the Publishing Triangle. Picking up several years after \\"Myra Breckinridge\\", \\"Myron\\" finds the banal man living with his wife in a nice California town, when suddenly he finds himself inside the movie \\"Siren of Babylon\\", during its filming in 1948. Myron struggles to find out what's happening to him as well as figuring out a way back, but the revitalized Myra is determined to seize control of the body they share and conquer the Hollywood of 1948, thereby recreating the world according to her wishes. Even more outrageous than its predecessor, \\"Myron\\" is loads of fun and showcases Vidal's wit, intelligence, and wild imagination.	2002-09-10

Swirling around this tale of doomed love are the many other characters who all influence each other and are themselves influenced. Most of the novel is about Rachel, but Helen Ambrose is equally central to the story, as a comparison to her niece and in her own internal voyage. Chronicling the inner lives of her characters, Woolf, in her first novel, explores the awakening of first love, the influences of men (and the culture they have control over) upon women, the confusions we as human beings have in our daily communications with others. Originally entitled &quot;Melymbrosia&quot;, &quot;The Voyage Out&quot; went through many revisions as Woolf claimed language for her own uses and effectively began a new literature (for her time), where the internal life and the interconnectedness of humanity are the central themes.	2002-09-07

And these dreams soon cause her to lose her home, and what else can a young woman do with no other skills but turn to prostitution? At first it's a life of freedom for Mary, but this doesn't last long, and in a moment, Mary's life changes and she's forced to flee to Monmouth, her mother's former home, where she believes she can start over. Befriending her mother's childhood friend Mrs Jones, Mary rebuilds her life and think she's escaped all she was in London. Her dreams of finery and living a high life prove to be her downfall yet again, and she falls back into prostitution, which is the first step in her spiral to the crime that will seal her fate. Donoghue's lush novel is based on sketchy historical facts. She's brought to life this unknown young woman, and shown us how the glamours of the beautiful life can lead one to ruin. &quot;Slammerkin&quot; is quite unlike Donoghue's other novels, and sometimes gets a bit plodding, but overall it's quite compelling and fascinating to witness this girl's life.	2002-08-24

When a letter from Nollop's statue falls, the island's governing council see it as a sign from Nollop and announce that from now on the islanders are not to use the letter (a Z) in either speech or writing.

Ella Minnow Pea is an 18-year old islander who is witness to this bizarre scene of government in action, and may actually hold the key to stopping this insanity as the tiles fall and the letters are outlawed.

With no solace in her family, she finds her choices for survival dwindling until a chance encounter with an unknown family member gives Odessa an opportunity to tell her story and to hear parts of her story she never knew existed. &quot;Fifth Born&quot; is a powerful tale of family secrets and treachery, and ultimately of survival and inner strength.

Unfortunately for all, CJ's exlover Debbe Lee is the owner and to say she's hard to work with would be like saying Hitler was a bit naughty. The staff at L-TV work hard and get nominated for several national awards. When Debbe accepts the awards and claims she's responsible for the award-winning programming, CJ and her staff plot to wrest some control from the Dragon Lady (i.e., Debbe) and retain their sanity, but can they pull it off when they're actually breaking a few laws? And as CJ's relationship with one of her staff grows into something more serious, what will the rest of the staff think? \\"It's in Her Kiss\\" is trashy fun that tests the reader's tolerance of nasty behavior and wish-fulfillment (when L-TV programming wins a mountain of awards).

Women left the cities for the wilderness to live their lives as they chose, but sometimes they were hunted, captured, raped, or killed. Now, years later, women's culture in the wilderness blossoms in balance with nature, and they've developed amazing abilities of flight and telepathy. The threat from the governing men of the cities seems to be growing, and the women struggle to decide their path as the gentles (those men dedicated to nonviolence, especially against women) contact them to assist. But can the gentles be trusted, even though they're men? \\"Wanderground\\" is a classic utopian story of interconnected tales, as well as a potent novel about the power of women as a group. With a force equal to such feminist classics as \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" and \\"Woman on the Edge of Time\\", \\"Wanderground\\" inspires us to envision a world lived in harmony with each other and with the world, and shows us the possibilities of reward in such an environment.	2002-08-15

As the year progresses a series of shattering secrets surface, and the bond between father and son becomes thinner, which isn't helped by Kevin's aunt who blames her sister's death on Kevin's father. \\"The Year of Ice\\" is a beautiful story of anguish and grief, of finding oneself amidst a chaos of family trauma, of growing up gay and having to hide. Malloy deftly writes with a sarcastic wit that brings Kevin and the other characters of the story to life, and pushes this novel closer to the reader's heart.

The Earth (now called Little Blue) has restructured with this new governing force, and the peacekeeping group, called the Kanshoubu, also assist in running the prisons. Since the bulk of the prison population is male, there is a growing worldwide movement to use the prisoners to find the biological cause of violence, but there is also a group advocating against this as well. When three of the world's large prisons stage revolts, the Kanshoubu must quell the violence, even as both sides of the debate continue. In this first book in a new trilogy, Gearhart explores the nature of violence in humanity and the different ways in which each sex deal with it. Told through a series of intriguing characters, this thought-provoking story challenges the reader's own conceptions of violence, leaving the reader to decide alone on which side of the debate to land. While there are similarities with such works as Jean Stewart's Isis series, Gearhart's new trilogy is less of a focus on individuals than on humanity as a whole.	2002-08-10

One of the women, Jaylynn Savage, is so smitten with Dez that she herself begins training to become a police officer. Dez, still recovering from her police officer partner's death as well as a series of relationships that ended badly, is jarred by Jaylynn's infectious spirit and uninhibited emotions. Dez is equally drawn to and skittish around the younger woman. And as Dez helps train Jaylynn, the two become more and more entangled, but can Dez overcome her emotional hang-ups and learn to love again? This magnificently written novel draws the reader into the private lives of both the women as it explores their will-it-or-won't-it relationship. While on the surface it seems like just another lesbian romance novel, \\"Gun Shy\\" turns out to be much more. With adept grace, the story leads the reader through the grieving process of the taciturn Dez, who ultimately must face her own inner demons if she wants to fully embrace a relationship with Jay. Even the minor characters are fully realized, and the book as a whole is a colorful tapestry that will entrance readers and leave them begging for more.	2002-08-08

Toni struggles to make amends with Pat, her former lover, and the two slowly begin to communicate about where to go from here. As the various women's lives and sometimes volatile relationships collide, so too does the earth as a major earthquake hits the area in January 1994, forcing the women to face some naked truths about each other and about themselves. Even though the earthquake has a deus ex machina feel (where it solves problems so the characters don't have to), &quot;Faults&quot; is quite a remarkable novel for creating a beautiful portrait of a present-day Chicana family to which everyone can relate.	2002-07-30

Weaving the past with the present, the story gives a full portrait of these two African American women who are both struggling to overcome their pasts and find a way to live in the present. While sometimes the story gets a bit overly dramatic and the flashbacks seem to meander at times, &quot;Fire and Brimstone&quot; is a compelling read as the reader follows Gayle and Chris through their trials to see if they can make it together.

Cameron's exquisitely written novel weaves flashbacks into the story, giving the whole an almost lazy summer day atmosphere, just like what the weekend was supposed to be for the characters. Not only is the story beautifully told, but the personal epiphanies of the characters are almost startling in context of the tale, and the human truths about loss and perception are quite universal and sharply rendered.

Growing up gay always has its challenges, and Burroughs definitely had his. His parents divorced because of his father's alcoholism and his mother's burgeoning madness. Believing it best for her son, his mother had her therapist assigned his legal guardian. And then Augusten finds that Dr Finch's family could be considered even more screwed up than his own family. His life becomes a madcap, sometimes surreal adventure where the reader sometimes wants to doubt the reality of the events, but nonetheless the reader just can't look away. Finch's other adopted son Neil becomes Augusten's first lover, even though Neil is over twice the boy's age, and then even that relationship is twisted. The story is dark and disturbing like the books by JT LeRoy or Scott Heim, but with a sense of bizarre humor like that of Edward Gorey. And sometimes it reminded me of \\"Ghost Dance\\" by Carole Maso, too. Overall this is a fascinating and horrific and funny memoir of a boy growing up with a bizarre and outrageous group of people and turning out to be oddly normal.	2002-07-03

The wedding is a beautiful affair, hosting all the big names that the small town of Dumont, Wisconsin has to offer. And then a freak accident results in a death at the reception. While at first it seems like a tragic accident, soon evidence points to a planned murder, and the prime suspect is none other than Roxanne, the newlywed. As Mark tries to unravel the convoluted threads of this mystery, more questions than answers come to the surface, but he's determined to clear the name of his best friend, the woman who introduced him to Neil. This book is a bit more staid than the previous Manning mysteries, but with a keen eye and mind, \\"Hot Spot\\" blooms into an intellectual puzzle that leads the reader through Manning's thought processes as he sifts through the bewildering tangle. At the heart of this latest mystery is the notion of family in the lives of gay men. Not only do Mark and Neil have an adopted son (Thad, who's leaving for college as the story ends), but they also have a wide circle of close friends who are indeed equal to family members. Since Roxanne is part of this chosen family, Mark won't sit idly by and let her go through this alone. Family, whether by blood or by choice, is wholly important. And this is what makes the Mark Manning series so endearing to fans.	2002-06-30

There are moments of crisp clarity where Acker conveys aspects of the story she's telling with the potent voices she uses, but these are not often enough to bring the story together except for the dedicated transgressive reader. This is the type of book that relies more on voice and atmosphere than on linear storylines, and Acker does succeed in giving us fascinating characters, but I was still left bewildered and numb by the end, as well as left wondering what this book was meant to convey.	2002-06-30

Apparently sometimes he feels himself a fraud due to his various identities (Jewish, Canadian, queer), but overall his cutting wit zings to the heart of his observations. A fun collection.	2002-06-10

He's getting older and discovering not only the emptiness of one-night stands, but also that he's not as unlike his parents as he would like. Holleran's sense of wry humor and his astute observations about growing older as a gay man are strong in this work and make it shine. This is a novel about the inner world, so apparently the lack of outside action aggravated some reviewers. I think Andrew Holleran is one of the best writers of gay fiction, so.	2002-06-10

After a few days, the police invade the building and arrest some of the members, and then the city tears down the building. While this is going on, the carpenter and the cook (who are essentially leaders-by-default in the group) have a love affair that is muddled when a visiting revolutionary becomes the third party in a love triangle. Using non-gendered language (and an invented pronoun), \\"The Cook and the Carpenter\\" doesn't reveal the genders of the protagonists until towards the end, thereby making the reader think about sex roles and gender roles consciously while reading the story. While this is certainly challenging, it's worth it for this tale that also addresses how differing viewpoints can affect any relationship.	2002-06-10

It's a fascinating collection that expands one's view of Virginia Woolf as a writer and as a thinking, highly intelligent woman. Her reviews of some of her contemporaries or such writers as Jane Austen, George Eliot, and the Bronts are thought-provoking and revealing about Woolf's inner life. Coupled with Barrett's insightful introduction, this book is a welcome addition to anyone's Woolf collection or to those interested in women as writers. It expands a bit on the notions presented in her famous &quot;A Room Of One's Own&quot;.	2002-06-10

Judith's journey veers from Gentle's when she finds evidence of buried and suppressed goddesses on Earth and in the other dominions. But the Autarch has domination plans of his own, and he won't be stopped without drawing blood first. \\"Imajica\\" is essentially about healing, and about love. Gentle is a broken man, a habitual womanizer, who's brought to a place of healing through his relationship with Pie 'oh' Pah, a mystif with the power to change sex according to another's true desires. Judith is claimed by many men, but she battles this ownership, and must find her own way and rely on her own strength if she's to assist in bringing the dominions back together. And ultimately it's in Judith's hands whether this healing of the Imajica comes about or fails yet again. It's a gorgeous epic fantasy that soars to a reader's heart, and once there plants a seed of imagining the world as a better place, much as Gentle and Judith do. This is one of my favorite all-time books. I feel so wordless in attempting to describe it.	2002-05-21

While trying to figure this out, and writing through the reasons, a new work emerged, \\"Gaslight\\", which is a gorgeous blend of memoir and fiction. Chronicling her struggles with anorexia, with homophobia and sexism, and with the politics of her art, Guess shares with us the process of creativity and its effects on the artist at work. Like the water that flows through that failed novel, \\"Gaslight\\" has a hidden strength, a luminous beauty, a kaleidoscope of muted colors that speaks volumes without dragging the readers away on riptides. This buoyant work reminds us of the power of words, especially in the lives of the marginalized (women, queers, the poor). It quenches and nourishes like water, and supports us as we reach for the surface for that breath of crisp air.	2002-05-21

When his father finally tires of him, he sends him off to live with Vanyel's aunt Savil. Torn from everything he's ever known, Vanyel descends into a deep depression, which isn't helped by Savil's abrupt demeanor. Savil is a teacher and a Herald, and Vanyel hopes to possibly be a bard someday, but finds his dreams destroyed. Tylendel, one of Savil's students, feels that he can help Vanyel through his pain, and tentatively makes contact with the younger teen. Vanyel and Tylendel soon begin a romance, which is put to the test when Tylendel's twin brother is murdered. Dragged into Tylendel's plan of vengeance, Vanyel becomes the focus for a whirlwind of magical powers which ultimately changes Vanyel forever. With the loss of Tylendel, Vanyel is adrift in pain, but through the efforts of Savil and her friends, he begins to heal the many wounds he's accumulated and to discover the scope of the magical abilities that have somehow awakened inside him. The first book in the Last Herald-Mage series is quite compelling and feels almost immature in the beginning, but that is more of a reflection of Vanyel's character.	2002-05-21

When the emperor of Magravandias finally dies, his sons and other factions maneuver to be the one to inherit the throne. The emperor's daughter Varencienne does not side with her brothers, but instead with her husband Valraven Palindrake, the heir to the reawakening sea dragon's power. The emperor's widow Tatrini has plans of her own, and brings forth the other elemental powers, setting in motion more than any of the various players could have imagined. The wizard Taropat returns, but his loyalties are muddled, until he's forced to confront his own shadowed past and mistakes, just like his former friend Valraven must do. As Tatrini and her powerful sons chase the Palindrake clan and finally corner them at the site where the Palindrakes's power was first muted, the Palindrake children determine the outcome of the battle. Storm Constantine outshines herself in this final book in the trilogy with a delightful and mesmerizing blend of machinations, personal enlightenment, and sexualities. The dnouement is a bit rushed, but it doesn't detract from the massive scope Constantine presents for the reader. Instead it leaves the reader with a stunned sense of survival, just like the characters in the trilogy, and with a sense of satisfaction in being witness to the characters' various journeys through tragedies to peace.	2002-05-21

He's resigned to his unknown fate, but his cellmate turns out to be a master spy whom Alec eventually knows as Seregil. Seregil rescues Alec and soon finds the younger man to be indispensable in more ways than one. Seregil begins training Alec as his apprentice in many skills: spy, thief, rogue, master of disguise. The two mistakenly steal a magical object, which almost destroys Seregil, but Alec rescues his mentor by bringing him home to Rhíminee, in Skala, where Seregil recovers, only to find himself at the center of a plot to destroy his homeland. And to top it all off, Seregil is beginning to feel attracted to his young student. Seregil must stifle his feeling so that he and Alec can put an end to the danger to Skala, but the danger may prove to have longer fingers than either of them anticipate. \\"Luck in the Shadows\\" begins a bit slowly, but soon the reader is in the thrall of the story, speeding along through the adventures.

And by the final page, you will. Donoghue's style here nearly compares to that of Jeanette Winterson, but it's more grounded in reality, featuring odd events in human history without the aspects of magical realism that Winterson uses so effectively. Also included are the references that inspired Donoghue to create each tale, thereby giving the readers the nuggets which began this collection. Maybe if we all beg together...	2002-04-16

For about two thousand years, the women have developed an intelligent, productive, perfect society, and with the entrance of the three men, they begin learning about the world outside their realm. The three men find that the women of Herland are ignorant (to their minds) of sexuality and gender roles, but the women are far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of education, child-rearing, population control, and agriculture. To fulfill their own curiosity and learn more, three women of Herland agree to become married to the three men. Unfortunately one of the men has not been able to overcome his own prejudices about how women ought to behave, and with one act he brings their time in Herland to an end. This fascinating story is decades ahead of most feminist, humanist works, and gives every reader an inspiring vision of how the world could be.	2002-04-15

From the 1930s to the 1950s, we follow the lives of Joe Kavalier, a refugee Jew from Prague, and his cousin Sam Clay as they explore the full, malleable, limitless possibilities of being American. Kavalier and Clay create the comic book sensation called The Escapist, which brings them both love and tragedy, richness and poverty, but always opportunities. Part of my devotion to the story is my nostalgic love of comic books, and part is the heartening (yet tragic) love story between Clay and the actor who plays The Escapist on the radio, and another is the sheer vast scope of Chabon's novel. Yes, he does meander a bit here and there, giving the readers almost a hundred pages of superfluous story, but this does not take away at all from the book. Strangely, this creates a sense that this is more than the story of Kavalier and Clay. This is a truly American story at heart. A story of dreaming big and tenaciously holding on to that dream.	2002-04-10

Her best friend Jean is a dedicated teacher whose marriage is crumbling. As Shayna realizes the depth of her feelings for Jean, she tries hard to not let them influence her actions, and she never imagines that the feelings could be reciprocated. After divorcing her husband, Jean has an epiphany about her life and her past, and discovers her attraction for Shayna, but can she change her attitudes and life to let this love exist? Marianne Martin's deligthful romance also features some challenging issues like race, and harassment in school systems, that enhance the burgeoning love story. Like most romance fiction, &quot;Mirrors&quot; skims the surface and doesn't delve too deeply or painfully into the characters's pasts, but instead the focus is on the love story of the two women. It's a well-written and lovely story that is sure to appeal to all readers of lesbian romance stories.	2002-04-06

While attending the local school, Torrance becomes entranced with a teacher named Sheila Massif, who isn't at all what she seems. Both she and her lover Duane are psychics, and Duane is on the lam from the government agency for which he works. Soon Malcolm's machinations begin to become apparent to Torrance, and he finds his life in danger of The Living One, who is at the heart of the Spoor curse. Looking at the plot, this book seems like it would be fascinating, and it is in parts. Unfortunately the modern epistolary form dissipates the story flow and after a while, it works against the book. And some of the chapters are amazingly poorly written. I ended up skimming the final third of the book just to reach the climax to see what would happen with these mediocre characters, and the ending was almost exactly as I expected.

Joey takes his edgy dance and his new lover back to New York, but ultimately things fall apart and eventually Joey is left without the sense of stability he once had. What saved this book for me was the modern epistolary form, a series of email between various characters in the story. This gives it a gossipy, fast-paced feel that salvages this melodramatic story from being the tepid gay pop fiction cliche that it could've been. I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did, and that it wasn't as bad as I expected.	2002-03-24

It's like an abstract painting through images and words, so it's difficult to elaborate on plot. Interspersed are pornographic scenes of gay sex between characters, which give the story a hallucinatory sensuality.

She is soon faced with the fact that her caregiver Harriet Hatfield is not unlike a jailer, though she probably means well. Caro is subjected daily to petty cruelties and subtle humiliations, and she almost succumbs to actually taking the tranquilizers she's brought. She keeps a journal to retain her faculties and as a last defense against infirmity. When a married woman temporarily helps out around the home, Caro learns the true nature of love, late in her life. Harriet finds Caro's journal and nearly destroys Caro's morale, but this only drives Caro into a last act of defiance and release. This is the second Sarton book I've read; the first being \\"Mrs Stevens Hears The Mermaids Singing\\" (#95 of the 100 Best Lesbian & Gay Novels). Her writing is superb and so beautiful. \\"As We Are Now\\" is her indictment against the treatment of the elderly and a brilliant book about growing old and struggling to cling to the world.

Fullin's Commitment Day is coming up, and it's not as smooth sailing as every other year's because a visiting scientist bring with him Steck, a neut who was exiled from Tober Cove twenty years ago. Fullin learns the history of his own heritage, and finds out that the Tober Cove's gods are not what everyone thought they were. I think this book is utterly fascinating (especially about the gender and sex roles commentary) and totally compelling. It's rough at the beginning, but soon I couldn't put it down. Steck's motivations for coming back to Tober Cove make perfect sense. Definitely recommended reading in my world!	2002-03-07

In each, Andrea Dworkin relays memories that helped shape her politics, her life, her intensity. For me, the book came alive and turned electric like Eve Ensler's \\"The Vagina Monologues\\" did, where ultimately it caused my eyes to become more open to social politics. Dworkin's memoir shows that sometimes tiny events can cause one to change, and sometimes the change is almost imperceptible until later reflection. It's amazing to see how a voracious reader and a zealous advocate began.	2002-03-06

It's certainly not the worst thing I've ever read, but it wasn't worth my time. I really wanted to like it because the whole going-back-to-one's-hometown thing always intrigues me (it's so universal), but unfortunately Sibley's characters didn't engage me at all.

Her crew is suffering from a mysterious malady when they're called on to investigate a potential act of war. Captain Bajana Ki's ship Heaven's Bow is from a different interstellar alliance and is on a mission to find the planet of their origin. The two ships become trapped by pirates and must get over their hostilities to work together. It's a great story, not unlike James Alan Gardner's \\"Expendable\\" series with Festina Ramos, and I did enjoy it for the most part. I felt that the story was quite weighty though. There are so many plots going on (that I didn't mention above) that three-fourths of the way through the novel I felt it would never ever end. Just when I thought things would be resolved, something else popped up. It did seem a bit much, but I still did enjoy the book overall and would read a sequel.	2002-02-27

Even though it seems that Hardy had a checklist of issues to go over, this gorgeous love story stands out for its honest portrayals. Since this was the first by Hardy I'd read, I was thoroughly surprised and drawn into the story. The language was a bit challenging for me at first, but it got easier.

The two slowly ease into a love affair, and as Evelyn's court appearance and scheduled departure loom ahead, the two struggle to figure out just how a relationship between two women could possibly last. Rule's writing is a bit dated for modern audiences, but the potency of Ann and Evelyn's love burns through the later parts of the novel. I think the movie adaption &quot;Desert Hearts&quot; beautifully captures the essentials of the book, but like the other reviewers have mentioned, it's almost a different story in places.	2002-02-25

The friendship blossoms, until Gabriel begins to doubt Pete's tales and existence. Could this be just an elaborate hoax? And if not, then how hurtful will doubting Pete's story be? Gabriel confronts his relationships with his estranged lover and with his aged father, and ultimately must learn that love is about letting go. \\"The Night Listener\\" is about the power of fiction and stories in people's lives, and reminded me of Felice Picano's \\"The Book Of Lies\\", but Maupin's book is nowhere near as aggravating in its ending and leaves the reader feeling hopeful, if somewhat bewildered.	2002-02-23

Sydney of course becomes embroiled in finding Vickie's husband, and soon finds her own life in danger. The mystery-thriller elements of the story are rather great, but my disappointment lies with the nonexistent background details of France. If this were a movie, it would've been filmed on a Hollywood backdrop, far from France. And the explanations often come far after the reader has been asking questions, so it's a tad frustrating. Lordon's &quot;East Of Niece&quot; is a pretty good mystery, but it certainly doesn't stand out in a crowd.	2002-02-22

He lives in the regimented, totalitarian OneState, a society based on mathematics. Everything is scheduled (eating, sleeping, working, sex). When he meets the woman I-330, his world begins to fracture as suddenly he develops emotions that are unknown to him. I-330 also leads him unwittingly into acts of revolution, but the OneState's Guardians seem to be one step ahead of them at all times. There's much to ponder and extrapolate in this story, and it does seem a bit unpolished (and I don't think it's due to Clarence Brown's translation). This is definitely fascinating literature, especially since it influenced Orwell's \\"1984\\", but sometimes the story is confusing. Overall Zamyatin's \\"We\\" is a classic dystopian tale that still is pertinent to today's world.	2002-02-21

I was surprised by the more serious ones, but I do feel they are a great progression for his voice. What I didn't like were the plethora of cutesy quizzes. After the third one, I felt they lost the attraction Ford probably meant, and they became tedious. Overall though, the collection is still vivacious and brilliant, but it does seem to lack a bit of that spunky skewering that he's most known for.	2002-02-20

Her horrid niece rents out parts of Sarah's house to offset the costs of her care, and Sarah overhears two of the tenants plotting murder. She cannot speak or write or move, so how can she communicate? Through perseverance she starts communicating with a little girl who had the patience to wait for her to blink (once for yes, twice for no), but how can Sarah convey her message if the question is never asked? And after her secret slowly comes to light, her life is in danger as well because no one has the full information. This is a highly compelling thriller that is so unique. The reader is as frustrated as Sarah throughout the book as she struggles to communicate through simple eyeblinks. Such a miniscule amount of information can be conveyed this way! I could hardly put the book down with wondering how it would end!	2002-02-17

After a few days with his friend Ron and his family, Harry returns to Hogwarts to find a new obnoxious professor and an equally obnoxious ghost haunting one of the girls' bathrooms. And soon disaster does strike as one student after another turns up seemingly turned to stone. Could Draco Malfoy, Harry's rival, be more menacing than originally thought? Or could Hagrid the gameskeeper somehow be connected to it all? Or could it actually be Harry himself, as some of his schoolmates believe? Harry is determined to figure out what's going on, especially after his friend Hermione becomes one of the victims. The best part about Rowling's storytelling abilities is how she can write a book that seems so familiar, and yet be entirely new and exciting and positively thrilling. The Harry Potter series deserves all the buzz given it, and more!	2002-02-14

Jeremy is also writing an epic novel about his absentee father and is generally lounging about, until he unintentionally, yet purposefully, outs his married lover to the world. Jeremy escapes before the fallout into his own search for a new start. He finds a real job for the first time in years; he reconnects with and slowly learns to appreciate his oddball family. And through it all he matures and skewers his friends, and ultimately finds love (maybe). \\"Jeremy Thrane\\" is quirky and intriguing, and yet midway through reading, I found that it bogged down where Jeremy flits about making a general nuisance of himself. Christensen's writing style, sense of humor, and her characterizations kept me interested, and with perseverance, I found myself compelled to find out how it all ends. While it's not as gorgeous and spectacular as Kranz's \\"Leaps Of Faith\\" or Hamilton's \\"The Short History Of A Prince\\" or Duncker's \\"Hallucinating Foucault\\", \\"Jeremy Thrane\\" is a charming and lively story of a gay man growing older and suddenly finding that life isn't so bad after all.	2002-02-09

Nelson is totally out at school and is often targeted for harassment from some of the students. His mom is in PFLAG, so his home life is okay, but Nelson can't tell his best friend Kyle how he truly feels for him. Kyle is slowly coming out of the closet, but the process is forced to speed up after his mom finds a porn magazine in his room. Luckily, his parents work toward being supportive of him. Kyle has always had a crush on Jason, one of the popular jocks at school. Jason has been dating the same girl for two years, and yet he's had these feelings for other guys. When he enlists Kyle to help him with schoolwork, Jason struggles to deal with what he's feeling for another guy, as well as dealing with an alcoholic father at home. This book is entirely filled with sappy and wish-fulfilling events and interactions that lend it an almost overly-sweet feel. Yet it's also entirely delightful. Reading \\"Rainbow Boys\\" is like looking back on high school and imagining the things that could have happened, all through rose-colored glasses. While the characters and the story do lack a certain depth, the book overall entertains and gives a hopeful glimpse into the future of high schools.	2002-02-09

His friends Ramir and Ingrid each have their own tumultuous lives, and Mitch's investigation into long-buried secrets stirs up more than he bargained for, and ultimately affects the lives of himself and his friends. And could Mitch have finally found love with the gorgeous movie company executive from Los Angeles, or is the handsome stranger hiding something as well? Dunford's second book is superbly written, thoroughly engrossing, and filled with hilarity, twists, and hijinks.

Tayler becomes infatuated with Erica and finds herself drawn into a dangerous web because an evil witch named Raven Delaire has targeted Erica for death. When Tayler finds that her feelings for Erica are reciprocated, she must find the powers within herself to stop Raven and save the woman she loves. Acker's captivating tale is a full-throttle supernatural thriller (the first of a trilogy) that is as confounding for the reader as it is for Tayler. The elements of Raven's curse and her motivations are revealed as the story progresses, but they don't answer all the questions. And the book could do with a bit of editing (especially that Spanish!) to streamline the story and clarify details, but overall it is great entertainment.	2002-02-02

I was spellbound within a few pages and was astounded at how energetic and compelling the story is. And this was published in 1937!

Bonding together and sharing an apartment, the two have a stormy relationship because of Bea's unrealized desire for Erica and her empty affairs with men, and because of Erica's self-destructive nature. As the Nazi influence in Holland grows, Erica lives in danger due to her half-Jewish heritage, but only Bea seems to recognize the danger. Erica does confess her same-sex relationships to Bea, but Bea can't seem to figure out where her own desires lie, and when Erica gets involved with the Dutch resistance, Bea finds it may be too late, in more ways than one. De Jong's groundbreaking work is further analyzed by Lillian Faderman's astute afterword. The story brings to mind such novels as \\"Aimee And Jaguar\\", Ebba Haslund's \\"Nothing Happened\\", and Erzsebet Galgoczi's \\"Another Love\\", all set around the same time, and all showing the limited possibilities for lesbian life in Europe during the mid-1900s.	2002-01-28

Like Christopher Isherwood stated, Mishima could be compared to Andr Gide for similarities in style, but there are differences as well.

Broken in spirit and body, Shan is taken by the wizard Taropat to be his apprentice, but soon Shan learns that his path encompasses more. He learns the story of Khaster Leckery and his lover Tayven Hirantel, and the tragic events leading to both of their disappearances. Both men have survived and since changed, and Shan feels compelled to bring them back together, if for nothing but closure. Soon fate brings these men together in a quest to claim the crown of silence, which can only be worn by the true king of the land, who it is hoped will overcome the evils of the Magravandian Empire. The story does drag in places, and seems to be filler for the trilogy. Yes, a lot happens to the characters, but in the grand scheme of the story, the book slows the momentum and I found it a struggle to get through sometimes. I was most fascinated when Constantine was telling about the court intrigues and the interconnections between the rival factions. I only wish the book was better, because &quot;Sea Dragon Heir&quot; was so enthralling, and I am looking forward to the next in the series nonetheless.	2002-01-16

The two plots converge and blend, leaving Corso bewildered and fighting for his life as those involved die in the wake of contact with Corso. He gets help from a mystery woman named for a woman in a Sherlock Holmes story, but at what cost does this help come? Fully intertextual and entirely mesmerizing, Prez-Reverte's thriller presents enigmas wrapped in mysteries that, when solved, leave the audience breathless. While I too had problems with the way the book ended, after reading the ending again, it makes perfect sense to me in the scope of the story presented here. I was a fan of the movie version, &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, until I read this book. Yes, the movie is pretty good taken by itself, but as an adaption it fails.	2002-01-15

Hastings and Poirot arrive to find the man has been murdered the night before! Poirot believes that things are not as the police believe, and is determined to prove his beliefs. Hastings meets his mysterious woman again and finds that he has personal stakes in the solving of the case, especially after the second body is discovered, because it can't be just a coincidence that his young woman suddenly appeared, can it? Full of Christie's trademark wit and personalities, &quot;Murder on the Links&quot; is an entertaining mystery that is certain to baffle the reader as it did Hastings and the police.

The male narrator loves Aida, but knows that one day she may leave him as she did her husband and her other lovers. She becomes his oxygen, his reason, his erotic muse, which all ultimately proves his undoing. Because to love someone is a personal, private thing, like a game of solitaire, that only the one can enjoy fully. Reminiscent of Violette Leduc's &quot;Thrse And Isabelle&quot;, Slavenka Drakulic's &quot;The Taste Of A Man&quot;, and Kate Millett's &quot;Sita&quot;, Peri Rossi's magnificent story is a seductive look at the realities of sexual passion.	2002-01-03

After the storm, they find the stars have changed, and they're probably in around 1250 BC. Those who don't kill themselves or go crazy must find ways to survive, and they do so by forming a new government and militia headed by a former police officer and the Coast Guard captain (who's a lesbian). Things seems to be going well until a Coast Guard officer named Walker seizes the weapons and heads toward what will be Britain to establish his own kingdom. Unwilling to let history be mangled by a megalomaniac, the Nantucket Islanders send their militia to stop his plans. But even if they win, what cost will be inflicted on history? Stirling's highly contagious story is thought-provoking and inventive, although the sheer mass of the story's scope weighs heavily on the reader, making some passages rather tedious. Unfortunately, the final battle of the book becomes a hearty cliché, but that certainly doesn't deter from any reader's enjoyment of this story. Provided, of course, that the reader doesn't mind reading about the starring lesbian couple. Even with my hesitations with this book, I am rather eager to find out what happens next, and that's due to Stirling's driving storytelling.	2001-12-31

The plots vary from story to story, but Allegra's lush writing style stays strong, although in a couple of stories it's muted when the story stretches past its limits, but the energy picks up again by the time the title novella is reached. It is this passion in the women's lives though that lingers with the reader, whether it's passion for the rhythms, passion for another woman, or passion for what dancing can evoke in spectators or dancers.

Toklas	Books	5	34	37	N	N	Language as liquid	Gertrude Stein's playful and witty story of her life with Alice Toklas (told via the life story of Alice) chronicles nearly thirty years, up to 1932. Crackling with energy and zest, the story unfolds like conversation at a party where Picasso, Hemingway, Matisse, and others are in attendance, and the reader is introduced to them all in succession. Documenting not only their exciting life together, the book also takes us through the dangers of World War 1, as well as detailing Stein's writing activities. Ultimately, it is Gertrude Stein herself who shines throughout the book, through the lens of Toklas, and it is this portrait crisp and alive that makes this the most well-known of her works.	2001-12-16

The League of Peoples ensures that life is sacred and that there's no war and little crime. Festina, who is also bisexual (although this has nothing to do with her status as an Explorer), finds that she and her partner have been chosen to go to Melaquin, the planet from which no Explorer has ever returned. Festina is not amused and is determined to survive. Melaquin is apparently the dumping ground for undesirable personnel (like crazed Admirals who refuse to retire) and for various Explorers. Upon landing on Melaquin, Festina finds it's not unlike how Earth used to be. And the similarities only get stronger. And weirder. Did the Explorers who arrived before her and her partner survive? If so, where are they? &quot;Expendable&quot; is a captivating story full of whimsical and sarcastic humor, as well as intriguing social commentaries. It's a fascinating adventure for Festina and the reader who's plunging along, fully involved. I wavered rating the book either 4 or 5, and finally settled on 4 because it does end as one would expect, but that didn't disappoint me in any fashion. Instead it made me want to read more and find out what happens in the next book.	2001-12-14

With their depleted dragon population, the Dragonriders are hard pressed to stop the threat of the stellar threads from destroying Pern, until Lessa discovers a way to bring more dragons... I did enjoy the story, but I found it awkward at the beginning, and it moved too quickly for me in some places so that I didn't always get a clear view or sense of place or action. And I never did get around to liking Lessa. She's very petulant, and hardly wavers from there. Despite these misgivings, I still found &quot;Dragonflight&quot; rather compelling and I do plan on reading more about Pern at some point.	2001-12-09

When the Magravandian Prince Bayard offers to help them reconnect to the power of the sea dragons, the three get involved in a dangerous game, which fails because of their unbridled lust for each other. A few years later, Bayard's sister Varencienne is brought to Caradore through an arranged marriage to Valraven. She falls in love with the land, and slowly learns its secrets. Through Varencienne, the Palindrake clan has a possible way to reclaim their heritage as the heirs of the sea dragons' powers, but do they want this, when they are controlled by Magravandias? Varencienne struggles to become her own person away from the manipulations of others and find a way to salvage the land she loves for the future. I was almost put off by some of the disturbing incestuous relations, but Constantine's storytelling power held me in sway and pulled me through the grand tale. I was also captivated by how she related the lives of the women left behind in Caradore, while their men were off fighting for the Magravandian Empire. It is through them that the true power of the land is gained (this all reminded me of the movie version somewhat of &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, I have yet to read the book, so). A few times I couldn't help but think that Storm Constantine is almost a female Clive Barker in her large stylings and massive storytelling, and this certainly makes me want to read more by her. This is certainly not a book for the dour, but a sweeping epic in the making that explores the place of magic in people's lives.	2001-12-05

Written as a love letters of sorts to Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West, &quot;Orlando: A Biography&quot; follows Orlando from the years of Queen Elizabeth I's reign to late 1928, from the time he was a man to the time she became a woman. With this book, Woolf tried to give a fantasy life to her lover, where she could be a man and be her own person, instead of subject to society's ways. And by itself, it's such a gorgeous story! Especially with the fascinating asides where Orlando is addressing the reader.	2001-12-04

Isherwood's writing is superb, and fills this brief space with a lush garden of a story. Here's a quote: &quot;This business about the box office is just a sentimental democratic fiction.

Her mother was a famous poet whose private spiral into madness held the family together as it forced each person into her/his own separate world. After her mother's tragic death, Vanessa's often-silent father disappears and her brother shifts from place to place, sending cryptic postcards to his sister. Even Vanessa's mother's lover Sabine seems unable to embrace her own grief. Through it all, Vanessa struggles to resurface through the pain, through the family dysfunctions, through the wavering and tenuous hold on reality. She struggles to come back to living and not plummet into madness like her mother. Carole Maso's amazing and brilliantly woven story plumbs the depths of grief in a style totally her own. Swinging from reality to memory to imagination, Maso charts Vanessa's mental state as she climbs back to living. I was often reminded of Virginia Woolf's works while reading, and found myself wondering about possible connections. &quot;Ghost Dance&quot; is truly a book to behold.	2001-11-25

Katherine Jackson organizes his biography using excerpts from journals, emails, interviews, and Baker's own art, and calls it &quot;The Song of the Earth&quot;, the title of one of Baker's favorite poems. Baker's life was a sometimes sad one, due to the experiments his mother conducted to try to ensure his artistic talents. The science fiction aspects of Nissenson's novel are fascinating: gender wars, technological and genetic advancements. There's also religious struggles with old religions vying with newly established ones. This is also a world where sexual diversity is rather commonplace as well. &quot;The Song of the Earth&quot; is more than a cautionary tale about the human desire to control evolution and destiny; it's also about a young gay man trying to find himself in the middle of personal chaos. And then, after Baker's death, everyone who knew him puts forth a different interpretation of his life and artworks (also included in the novel), and this makes for even more fascinating reading: how each person can interpret another person's life for her/his own ends. Humanity, indeed. Nissenson's &quot;The Song of the Earth&quot; is definitely one of the most arresting stories I've read this year.	2001-11-24

Well, it is, but not in the way one would expect. It's more about Cho's life and where her comedy comes from. It's about her journey through tragedy and pain to the beautiful places within herself, where she can love herself. Yes, there are parts of her comedy routine here, but more than that, there are incredibly powerful, inspirational autobiographical snippets. I was amazed at Cho's capacity for writing. I found myself drawn into her story, consoling and cheering along with her and her friends. That is Cho's power as a comedian and as a person. She brings us into her world and makes us hers.	2001-11-20

Crispe is a famous chef, whose culinary art has intriguing effects on those who consume it. Using all sorts of meats in his dishes (including human flesh and juices), Crispe documents and reminisces about his friends and acquaintances. It's all rather fascinating, but not having read &quot;Confessions&quot;, I was quite lost, like it was all a private joke I was missing out on. Nonetheless, this is an interesting addition to such cannibalistic fiction as Virgilio Piera's \\"Ren's Flesh\\", Slavenka Drakulic's &quot;The Taste of a Man&quot;, and Poppy Brite's &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot;.	2001-11-18

Struggling with her relationship with Teresa, Julie meets the alluring Fedora on the same night that a young woman in murdered nearby. Julie soon learns that Fedora isn't what she seems. That is, she isn't a person per se. She is a time-travelling spirit, with a connection to Julie's great-grandmother, who has come to help Julie solve the murder, and locate some missing hats. Really. In a non-stop madcap adventure, Julie finds herself in danger, and unwittingly brings the danger home to Teresa. It's a fun read (and I didn't find it &quot;laugh out loud&quot; funny as the book description claims), and it will appeal to lovers of mysteries by Claire McNab, Mary Wings, and Barbara Wilson.	2001-11-17

Often humorous, always poignant, Read's autobiographical essays are a unique view in the ocean of gay memoirs. I thoroughly enjoyed Read's zesty style and often found myself relating somewhat to his experiences. I think it might've been better if it were organized chronologically, but that didn't bother me too much. Yes, I do admit to a bias because I know Kirk (he even mentions me in the acknowledgments!). This is a marvelous book from a writer whose spirit is infused and hardly contained in this book, and by the time the end is reached, the reader is left inspired, uplifted, and hungry for more.	2001-11-13

Beth has been dating a slew of guys, looking to awaken her heart, and soon finds herself torn between the burgeoning love she feels for Laura and the deep desire she feels for Charlie, a man. It's a compelling story and reflective of the attitudes in the 1950s, although with a twist: the lesbian character has a hopeful ending instead of a sad one. It's wonderful to see this work back in print because of its historical value.	2001-11-11

Hollywood superstar Todd Pickett sees his star is fading, and after a botched plastic surgery, he retreats to the nearly forgotten place nicknamed Coldheart Canyon to heal. The canyon was named for Katya Lupi, a forgotten star of Hollywood's silent era, who remains alive and young after all these years due to some trapped magic in the basement of her paradise palace. Once the sexually voracious Katya has Todd in her clutches, she won't let go, even when his number one fan Tammy tracks him down and tries to free him. Does Tammy have what it takes to free her beloved idol, or will she herself fall victim to the house's magics? And there's more to this tale than a ghost story. There's the commentary about the Hollywood star engine and how it consumes those it possesses (not that this is a new topic), as well as the power of redemption and forgiveness. This is a much more adult novel than any of Barker's previous books, and I can see its beginnings in &quot;Sacrament&quot; and &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot;. &quot;Coldheart Canyon&quot; proves that Barker is more than a teller of horrific stories, but rather a teller of tales that reach into our depths and pull out our common fears. I am a huge fan of Barker's works, and I can certainly say that this book does have a few flaws. I didn't always care for the characters, and the ending was a bit too tidy, but overall Barker's genius for telling a compelling story kept me interested, and that is what is at the heart of &quot;Coldheart Canyon&quot;: bearing witness to every nuance of life.	2001-10-29

The edition with drawings by Edward Gorey is marvelous and succinct. I am not sure I got all the references nor the inside humor (and it all seems like one big private joke [this play was intended for private enjoyment after all]), so I am not as moved as I usually am by Woolf's work, and yet it has a sort of magic and wit. Overall it's a welcome addition to one's collection of Woolf or Gorey, even if it is nearly inaccessible to the layman.	2001-10-25

She falls in love for the first time with a robot called Silver, and feels like her life has been thrown into disarray. One of her friends, Clovis (a gay man), helps her to be with Silver, and Jane runs away from home to live with Silver in one of the worse-off areas of the city. Silver and Jane live happily for some time, with each teaching the other what it means to be human, to be living, until the company which created Silver seeks to reclaim him due to his &quot;flaws&quot;. Tanith Lee's fascinating novel is the story of growing up, of becoming one's own self apart from family and friends, of developing one's own beliefs and persona. This is the type of book which gets better the longer one digests it. It's a celebration of first love, even one that ends sadly.	2001-10-24

In 1928, Lark (a gay man) and Nora (a divorced mother of two) buy a house in Truro on Cape Cod, and seek to people it with fellow artists. The novel follows the next fifteen years as life takes many paths for each of True House's denizens. Taking elements of Virginia Woolf and E. M. Forster (among others), and injecting a wholly American element, Lippincott created a cohesive piece that inspires and challenges standard storytelling. Like Carole Maso's works, &quot;Our Arcadia&quot; seeks to make a new path of literature, and does so with a graceful, feminine beauty. Without a doubt, this is one of the best books of 2001.	2001-10-24

Not wanting to live with her aunt, she shares an apartment with two women, Ruth and Jael, who help introduce her to a grander scope of the world at large. Maria makes a few other friends, but it is Ruth and Jael who are her centerpiece, but when she discovers they're lesbian lovers, she's not sure what to think anymore. She adapts, and tries to follow her classmates and get interest in dating and clubbing, but it all seems flat and uninteresting. Ultimately, a single moment at New Year's clarifies Maria's feelings and helps her realize just who she wants. Donoghue's marvelous first novel is exquisitely rendered, and quite fulfilling. I found some of the middle passages a bit tepid, but this was a brief feeling, and Donoghue's writing captured me again soon after. I am a huge fan of her book &quot;Hood&quot;, and it's wonderful this book has come back into print!	2001-10-11

When she encounters the woman (Anne) in one of her classes, Flannery spins out of control, and ultimately cannot escape the power of the mutual attraction when Anne and Flannery meet a few weeks later. The two embark on a beautiful affair filled with poetic bliss and patient devourings. As the months pass, Flannery notices a space within Anne that she cannot touch, and finding out what fills that space dissolves the glamour of their love. And yet what they gave each other lingers. Brownrigg's delicious tale is fully akin to such lesbian classics as Violette Leduc's &quot;Thrse and Isabelle&quot; and Dorothy Bussy's &quot;Olivia&quot; (I could certainly name others).

I don't usually read nonfiction, so I found this daunting at first, but the further I delved, the more I couldn't put it down. Exploring sex, love, friendship, and more through the lens first created by Charles Darwin, Wright uses Darwin's own life to explain and elaborate on the principles he puts forth, all of which are easy to understand and fathom. I found myself taking more and more notes as I went on. It was almost like being back in the classroom! This is a book that begs to be read again and again, and the reader desires this too! I can understand why some readers would think this almost justifies misogyny, but it doesn't. Rather, it explore its roots and explains why it's so prevalent and tenacious.	2001-09-24

I am a huge fan of Gaiman's work, and this showcases his talents, but it does have a few flaws. We aren't given enough character development, and the amount of amazing people and views and things in this story is overwhelming, and we never really have time to digest or enjoy them to the fullest. Despite this, this book is still remarkable, and it's based on a great miniseries, too. And this book features two of most stellar assassins ever seen in fiction: Croup and Vandemar.

The main character is a lesbian called Wittig, who follows her guide Manastabal through purgatory and witnesses atrocities done to women by men. Lesbians are viewed as monstrous and other, and apparently have their own place here in Hell. It's a fascinating and vivid depiction, and certainly reflects Monique Wittig's body of work perfectly. At the end the character Wittig crosses the Golden Gate Bridge and finds herself in paradise, surrounded by the women she has been able to save.	2001-09-02

Charles, his older brother, and his younger brother all go with their father on an extended vacation. As they head toward the Beanstalk which ferries people from Earth to the moon and beyond, the kids discover their father is actually kidnapping them. It's not until they travel partway up the Beanstalk that the authorities stop them after their mother finds out what the father is up to. The three kids must decide whether to return to their verbally abusive mother, to travel with their irresponsible father into the stars, or to choose their own destiny. I agree with one of the reviewers who stated that the characters lack depth and are utterly obnoxious through most of the story. It's only toward the end that I actually cared for any of them, and that was tenuous at best. There's a lot of intriguing things in the story: Earth's denizens' self-destructive behaviors, Charles's older brother comes out as gay, Charles comes of age and discovers he doesn't have to emulate his parents. But the characters nearly ruin the book, but not quite. I am sufficiently intrigued to read the sequel, so I am pleased with the book overall, but it's certainly not perfect. An enjoyable, light read.	2001-09-01

Muffin has confessed, but Blue doesn't buy the confession. Blue is still mourning the disappearance of her lover Misha two years ago, and likes getting the money, but she ends up with more than she can handle when Muffin is murdered in prison and Blue is targetted next. It's a thoroughly enjoyable ride, but the mystery elements get baffling fast and while this could certainly derail many readers, I found Padgett's witty characters and exciting style drew me further in. Like Laurie King's &quot;Night work&quot; and Lauren Maddison's &quot;Witchfire&quot;, there's a strong feminist thread through the story that educates as it entertains. And while the density of the convoluted mystery plot annoyed me until the very end, I highly recommend this book, and I can hardly wait to read the next in the series.	2001-08-31

Trless is a young man attending a private school, where he befriends two rough characters, Reiting and Beineberg. The two target the weaker Basini after it's discovered he's been stealing, and the torture and manipulation begins. At first, Trless watches and participates in a listless, detached fashion. He's intrigued by the moral and philosophical dilemmas of committing evil, but this eventually turns to distaste as the beastliness and grotesqueness of their collective actions against Basini mount. Trless begins to empathize with Basini, and after following Beineberg and Reiting's lead and having sex with Basini, young Trless wakes up and disconnects abruptly from his former friends. Perhaps Trless needed these interactions in order to figure out his own path in life? There's much grist for discussion here, and it's certainly not an easy book in subject or language. I read an earlier translation than the one here, but I expect it to be the same. Other books this reminded me of include Garland's &quot;The beach&quot;, Gide's &quot;The immoralist&quot;, Mann's &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, Hesse's &quot;Steppenwolf&quot;, and &quot;Lord of the flies&quot;.	2001-08-31

Each of the other musicians has her or his own secrets, and when one of them is murdered, Cassandra is as baffled as everyone else (including the reader). And what of the mysterious oboe player Anna de Hoog? When she makes the moves on Cassandra, is there something more sinister in mind? Barbara Wilson's mystery is an entertaining story with many bewildering turns. As a reader, I didn't feel for any of the characters here, but rather I was enchanted by the sights of Venice and the fascinating history Nicky and Cassandra explore about Vivaldi and the orphaned girls who became musicians.	2001-08-25

Ulysse M&eacute;rou, a journalist, joins an expedition into the stars. Arriving on an Earth-like planet, they discover humans acting like animals, and apes acting like people. Through M&eacute;rou's struggles to survive, we are treated to a fascinating indictment of societal and cultural stagnation that is a possibility even today. An important point for me is when Cornelius (an ape scientist) is expounding on the planet's cultures, and he explores the lack of progress. He theorizes it is because the apes having been copying only themselves, and not thinking outside the box. This is certainly happening today, in politics and in arts &amp; culture. The book does have a dated feel, but this, for me, doesn't take away from the story. And the surprising ending was something I never expected.	2001-08-25

It centers mostly on Blackie Cole, a butch nightclub singer employed by the mafia, who discovers a dead man in the club. When the dead man's sister shows up, Blackie is torn between her growing desire for the uptown woman and her duty to her mob boss. And Blackie's ex-girlfriend isn't quite through with Blackie either. Through a series of mishaps, Blackie's mob boss thinks she's ratted him out, and targets her for elimination. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and found it rather intoxicating at times. I felt the story as a whole was diluted by the tidal wave of characters populating the novel, some of whom were throwaways lasting a page or so. Some of these details became distracting to me because they seemed unnecessary by the book's end. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend &quot;Under the Mink&quot; not only to lesbians in search of a new romantic thriller, but also to anyone searching for a well-written and involving historical novel. Lisa Davis is certainly a writer worth reading.	2001-08-20

After Joshu rejects his advances (despite a mutual attraction) in favor of his faith, Victor turns toward an offer of darkness, and becomes a vampire. For centuries he wreaks havoc with Joshu's followers. In the guise of a monk, Victor enters a monastery where he finds Brother Michael, who just might offer the kind of love and peace Victor craves. But Victor will not turn from his dark path, and Michael cannot leave his convictions behind, so what can the lovers do? Schiefelbein's intelligent and potent tale is equal parts thriller and meditation on the boundaries of light &amp; dark (heaven &amp; hell). Despite its typical vampire story ending, &quot;Vampire Vow&quot; is an extraordinary book worthy of high praise. If you adore Ulysses Dietz's &quot;Desmond&quot;, then you will certainly delight in this.	2001-08-20

Struggling to keep her wits and to survive, she must change from the rhythms of living with other people to living according to the seasons and the animals she must take care of (a dog, a cow, some cats, others). Haushofer's stellar tale is a concise, powerful indictment (much like Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;) on the destructive capabilities of our world as run by men. It's through the rhythms of women and of nature that survival is possible through any adversity. My favorite quote: &quot;Loving and looking after another creature is a very troublesome business, and much harder than killing and destruction. It takes twenty years to bring up a child, and ten seconds to kill it.&quot;	2001-08-20

As other reviewers have noted, this is Dame Agatha's first book, and her style isn't as it is in her later books, but it is utterly delightful and full of surprising turns.

The two change history, but the world doesn't turn out how they intended. Michael struggles in this new, disturbing world to find the physicist and to right the wrong, and along the way he finds love with another man. But will this love survive when they try to set the world right? Sometimes fun, always intelligent, this novel can be called a sci-fi comedy, or just a highly imaginative book.

After another professor is killed, Jill finds that she herself might be next. Porter's saucy thriller, told through a series of poems, electrifies the senses and rockets the reader to its shocking end.

Kate struggles to help her mother achieve better health, in order to avoid the imprisonment that nursing homes provide. The book is an obsessive blend of the personal and the political (which is Millett's exceptional forte), and the beauty of her writing, of her imagery, of her universality of experience all make this a remarkable memoir. Not only for the conveyance of why nursing homes are such dumping grounds of people, but also because of the beauty of reestablishing a relationship with one's own mother in the time before the mother's final days. It is this graceful, simple love between a mother and a daughter which makes this book shine, and which makes its universality so potent. This is a biography to hold close to the heart, long after the final pages.	2001-07-28

Now that's gorgeous storytelling. It's just unfortunate that the horribly ungrammatical &quot;could of been&quot; is so rampant in this book. It was so jarring every time I saw it.	2001-07-28

Berekiah Zarco is one of the New Christians, those Jews forced to convert to Christianity, but Zarco and his family and friends also secretly practice the Jewish faith. As the massacre overwhelms the city, Zarco discovers his uncle and an unknown woman murdered in the family cellar, locked from the inside. Obsessed with finding those responsible, Zarco, along with his former lover Farid, risks his safety hunting for clues. The two also brave the maelstrom of atrocities to find their missing relatives and friends. I found it difficult to connect with the characters at the beginning, but as the story wound itself into patterns, the book became hard to put down. I was rather surprised at the untrumpeted homosexuality of Farid, which is mentioned a few times in the book. It's treated as part of the texture of his personality and nothing more, which is as it ought to be. I think it's a great book overall, although the parallels to the Holocaust and other instances of intolerance aren't as poignant and clearcut as one would think. Still, it's highly recommended, especially for its historical detailings.	2001-07-16

There, she submerges herself in her work and in nightly encounters with various men. It's not until many years pass, that Barrington is able to grapple with her grief and visit her parents' grave in Gibraltar. This autobiography is about the struggle to overcome past tragedies and pain, and to finally embrace the full emotional range of one's self in the journey to wholeness. I was rather enchanted with Barrington's style, yet I felt she didn't delve into the depths as much as the memoir warranted. She does address this in the narrative, where she remarks on how people reacted upon hearing of the deaths of her parents at sea. Everyone does deal with tragedy in different ways, and who's to say which is more appropriate?	2001-07-04

There are a lot of themes being addressed here, and not all are successfully elaborated. Delany hints at a lot of things (sexuality, politics, the nature of patriotism, etc), but ultimately glosses over some things in an effort to make the story streamlined. It's a good book overall, and well worth reading. After getting over the slow start, I was rather enthralled, especially by the low key sensuality throughout the story. I'd never really read anything by Delany before, and this book intrigued me enough to check out other books by him.	2001-07-04

Yes, the story has a few slow moments, but that's because we're investigating along with the Beresfords instead of appearing at the finale when all's revealed. Dame Agatha delivers a sharp, intellectual mystery, finally showing her fans the actual process of investigating. It might not become my favorite, but I disagree with previous reviewers who called it boring.

I'd read &quot;Sarah&quot; last year, and now I realize that I misjudged it, and I need to read it again. With elements of Dennis Cooper, Gregg Araki, Scott Heim, and Tom Woolley, and with a hearty dose of skewed whimsy, J. T. LeRoy is the hurricane rattling the windows of mediocre fiction.	2001-06-13

Suddenly, they become the guardians to a unique 11-year old boy. A boy with a love of make-up, wild outfits, and zest for living. Scot shakes up Ed and Sam's relationship, their friends, and their lifestyle, ultimately redefining everyone's notions of family. Downing's story is a zany one, full of poignant moments and hilarious episodes. This book is an utterly delight to read. I found the beginning rather without depth, and I couldn't connect with the characters or the story then, but as I became enraptured by Scot and his effect on Sam and Ed, then I found I couldn't put the book down. This would make an excellent movie, in the vein of &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot;!	2001-06-10

Ceci is a young woman and daughter of Holocaust survivors who is slowly edging into lesbian life, so she's totally overwhelmed at first. When the opening night's entertainment is sabotaged, her acquaintance suspects Ceci. Irritated, Ceci sets out to solve the mystery, but gets sidetracked when she meets Trudy, who shares her heritage. The two women begin exploring a relationship, and stumble upon the saboteur. Morris uses her extensive knowledge of women's music festivals to give this tale a rich, loving tone. There are many themes here, and it's unfortunate that the book is so short (134 pages!) because I would love to hear more about everyone featured here. This brevity works against the story on some levels, but overall Morris's style wins out by creating a passionate book of coming out in a sea of naked lesbians at a summer music festival. I wish I could go, too!	2001-06-10

The three slowly form a strong family unit that is later devastated by their various pasts, their pains and anger, their culture. After some time apart, they each heal and find their respective ways back to each other to recreate a new whole. Showcasing the vitality of the Maori ways, Hulme has used universal archetypes that make this story accessible. Yes, the language is challenging and unique. And yet, like writers such as Virginia Woolf, Hulme uses the words themselves, not just the imagery they convey, to move the story and give depth, which ultimately makes the reading a much more enriching experience. It is a story of humanity's hope through the detritus our world society creates in us.	2001-06-06

The two form a truce to survive, and ultimately become friends. Each slowly learns to trust the other, and they share dark secrets. The British soldier was incarcerated for indecency with a young girl, and the German soldier is gay. Brilliantly blending politics, human frailties, and lush storytelling, Maugham's final book is a fascinating tale of two soldier on opposing sides who find common ground in being human. Even though the story ends with one character killed, the book is ultimately hopeful and uplifting in its message of the commonalities of all people. Sheer genius storytelling.	2001-06-01

He's always been picked upon, due to his small size and his habits, but when the kids find out his mom's a lesbian, then his troubles get worse for a while. Jordy learns to adapt to each situation throughout his life, which is part of his charm. After high school, he works for a while in Silicon Valley, where he makes a ton of money, and when those empty feelings overwhelm him, Jordy travels to Latin America on a quest for renewal. From there he goes to Seattle, where he falls victim to a drive-by shooting. He flees across the country to Maine, trying to wake up to life again, and it's only through the interactions with his mother's partner Pat that he succeeds in grabbing a hold of life again. Forbes's novel is connected to her earlier novel, &quot;Alma Rose&quot;, but this can be read without reading the previous. Her writing is lively and skilful. This is a beautiful story about finding one's place in the world and in one's family, and about living every experience fully. &quot;Navigating the Darwin Straits&quot; is a perfect example of a book that's an utter joy to read.	2001-05-29

As the investigation becomes more personal, Nina follows the trail to the tiny Caribbean island nation of Misericordia, where apparently the man who killed Nina's husband and children is living under an alias. With her lesbian best friend Anna, Nina travels to Misericordia, where the two find themselves in the middle of a civil war. Kelley's writing is highly compelling and draws the reader quickly into the story with sharp and feisty characters. The ending is a bit of a reach though. And his politics are rather heavily slathered over the story, and sometimes his characters seem to lack depth, but overall I feel this is an excellent political mystery thriller with a great, progressive political slant. It's highly feminist, which is always a refreshing discovery.	2001-05-28

She finds she's in over her head as she finds the disappearance is connected to a gang of thieves and to a series of murders of children years ago. When Tuppence doesn't return home, Tommy has to track down his wife, just as Tuppence had to track the old woman. As other reviewers have stated, this is rather one of the more chilling of Christie's stories, mostly because of the psychological nature of the villain.	2001-05-26

In order to understand what drove his friend to her death, he follows the trail of her life, and finds Livia, who's in a hospital after being shot by her husband. He finds out that Eva was strong in her beliefs in a dangerous time, and that Eva was having an affair with Livia. Galgczi's amazing novel is full of Hungarian politics, as well as character studies of people struggling with low expectations and betrayals. The book is also the basis of the movie &quot;Another Way&quot;, but the book is much more clear about Eva's motivations for trying to leave the country.	2001-05-22

He slowly becomes involved in Dublin's gay community, and meets another guy who's a few years older, but before anything can happen, Neil is attacked by gay-bashers. After recovering, Neil finds that dating is difficult, especially when he's hiding so much, and the relationship sours. Neil comes out to his parents and friends, and finds some support, but everything changes, some for the worse and some for the better. This amazing coming out story does end with hope and a possibility for a connection to combat the loneliness of living as a gay man in a small town. Like Stuart Thorogood's &quot;Outcast&quot; and K. M. Soehnlein's &quot;The World of Normal Boys&quot;, Lennon's book is a potent, poignant tale of what it's like being young and gay.	2001-05-22

Each uses the other for her/his own purposes, ultimately ending in both ruin and success. This book is especially significant because Claire, in a slightly different form, has appeared in the Mark Manning series, and will soon be starring in her own.	2001-05-20

One of his close friends is savagely murdered and the police target Adrien as the prime suspect. When another friend is also murdered, Adrien is forced to figure out the killer's identity before he becomes the next victim. And are the police detective's motives sinister or not? And what about the mysterious journalist who keeps popping up? I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, but found the editorial errors rather distracting. And Adrien is constantly referred to as middle-aged and he's only 32!! It makes one wonder about Josh Lanyon, the author.	2001-05-20

Mark, with the help of his friends and lover Neil, must untangle the complex motivations to find out who actually killed the boy Jason, and clear Thad before the community acts on its popular opinions. The strength of the Manning series is the relationship between Mark and Neil, as well as the parent-child relationship they have with Thad. There's just nothing else like it! It's not often where we get to read about a male couple's love, emotionally and physically. Meanwhile, the mystery plot twists and swerves to an unexpected conclusion. Leave it to Michael Craft to continue surprising his fans and raising the bar for modern mysteries and gay fiction.	2001-05-15

Virginia Woolf, Stella Bowen, Artemisia Gentileschi, and others are threaded into this vibrant tapestry. The final fable of the princess with the silver hands is actually the single basis of the rest of the book: the idea of women finding their own agency in the world, whether in art or in daily life or in relationships with men and/or women. The language is supple and complex, which might deter some readers seeking light reading, but the sheer beauty of Modjeska's writing seduces and inspires. It's like an essay, but through fiction, as if &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; were a faerie tale of sorts. &quot;The Orchard&quot; is a powerful book that deserves many visits.	2001-05-15

Soon their escort business draws the attention of nosy reporters and the police, and the duo have to put their heads together to get the whole mess sorted out without losing each other because along the way, they've fallen in love.

His story, &quot;465 Acres&quot;, is a poignant tale of a man facing the man he let get away, and his anguish over the choices he made. Thomas Long gives us a portion of a novel-in-progress that only whets the appetite for more. It's the final day of a reverend, and the hidden parts of his life that are discovered after his death are going to be a shock. There are also outstanding pieces from Dan Stone and George Singer, both giving us a glimpse into being young and gay and in the South. It's a great collection, also including stories by Robin Lippincott, Jameson Currier, and Walter Holland.	2001-05-05

It reminded me of Jean Genet and Dennis Cooper, yet with a happier ending, if that's possible. The narrator crawls through his days having sex in almost every form, and eventually he finds it all empty, and escapes, in a way. It's rather fascinating and somewhat sexy, but not easily accessible.	2001-05-03

I found the narrator's voice a bit difficult to follow at first, but I did catch on after a bit, and found the book enthralling. There are a few clues along the way as to the murderer's identity, but it's still a surprise when the ending comes. A wonderful lesbian mystery that's certain to catch fans of the noir genre.	2001-05-02

I found this to be an amazing story of following one's heart to fulfill one's destiny. The use of metaphors is masterful; I found myself constantly pausing to consider a turn of phrase, a conversational point, a moment of action. I disagree with the reviewer who described this book as not life-changing. Like Daniel Quinn's &quot;Ishmael&quot;, this can be a single step along one's path to a better vision of the world. The lessons the world has to tell us are simple, but actually listening to them is the difficult part.	2001-04-30

It's a noteworthy for the political slant she includes, because that's not terribly common for her books. It constantly amazes me the amount of pertinent details Christie includes for the readers. Some are red herrings, and some are decisive. Agatha Christie was certainly the best.	2001-04-30

Each chapter uses aspects of his life as a springboard for a discussion of things related to sleep. Sometimes the details almost became monotonous or tedious, but Hayes's style kept me interested in the intriguing details and little known information. I learned so much in this book, as well as thoroughly enjoyed the various reminiscences of Hayes's life, like his apparently inherited insomnia, his partner Steve's battles with HIV, and his search for a &quot;cure&quot; for his insomnia. He ultimately doesn't find an absolute cure, but rather he must come to grips with his unique sleeping patterns. This is an amazing memoir sure to fascinate even those who enjoy a good night's sleep.	2001-04-28

Every story is at least intriguing and mentally stimulating, if not actually hot and steamy. The outstanding stories for me are by Raven Kaldera (which includes the transgendered person), Margaret L. Carter (one of the most erotic stories I've read in ages; male-male, human-beast), and Mary Anne Mohanraj. This anthology also includes stories by Gary Bowen, Rene M.

He finds an escape, of sorts, by delving into sorcery, and he conjures a demon spirit which spirits him back through his life as if he's Ebenezer Scrooge. His cousin Jimmy is a reverend living with the memories of his deceased wife, as well as struggling with his own inner demons. Interwoven in these tales is the story of not only the Cross family, but also of the disappearing ways of life in the South, most specifically the lives of African-Americans in the South. It's a potent, rhythmic narrative that draws the reader further and further into Horace's painful tale. I stumbled through some of the beginning pages, but it certainly became more accessible as the book continued. Considered one of the 100 Best Lesbian and Gay Novels, Kenan's &quot;A Visitation of Spirits&quot; is certainly worthy of that distinction.	2001-04-24

Through Marisol, John learns what love can be, and he learns how to reach out to his parents and how to listen to himself. It's a poignant story about dealing with the aftermath of divorce, and about a straight kid dealing with a gay friend. I had a hard time getting into it at first, and it wasn't because of the edgy fonts and zine-like constructions. I had a hard time liking John, but that rang true the more I learned about him, that he didn't even like himself really, so how could we?	2001-04-21

While chronicling her pregnancy, and the birth of her daughter, Maso also ruminates on life and death, on literature and art, on every minute detail of living. Each word, each sentences is a flower in a garden of joy, and when the birth begins, the expansive field of flowers is breathtaking, moving, exhilarating, and we the readers are there with her, through the frightening, beautiful, expansive moments of childbirth. Her many lucid moments of whimsy, and the terror of bringing a child into this dangerous world, make this book so real, so endearing, so utterly felt. This is an experience like none other, a writer creating a new work within her body and birthing not a book, but a beautiful daughter named Rose, a beacon of beauty.	2001-04-16

The underlying message appears to be how pointless things actually seemed (the Vietnam War, relationships, justice, life), and yet all the characters (and us as well) just keep soldiering on through the drudge and misery in the hopes that things get better.

Later that evening, Bertha finds a man dead in her office. In her beloved grandmother's neighborhood, a building is burned, and arson is suspected. And then someone breaks into Bertha's apartment. As Bertha finds these events, and more, are linked, she finds her own life in danger, as well as her grandmother's. And somehow this is all tied in with Bertha's own family history to boot. Her life is further complicated (if you can still breathe) by a powerful attraction to one of the cops she encounters. It's a high speed ride that's full of danger and twists, which almost becomes suffocating for the reader as we follow Bertha on her adventure, but luckily, Miller's writing doesn't allow that to happen. I hope Miller continues this series, and gives the readers a break next time and let us catch our breath at some point. Her characterizations are superb and zesty, and the blossoming romance between Bertha and the police officer Toni is realistically rendered, and rather exciting.	2001-04-12

His ex-lover Blaise is forbidden by his current lover from reading the book, but Blaise is drawn to it and discovers that it's a thinly-veiled tome about his current relationship. The further he reads, the more Blaise is shaken from the ennui which threatened to engulf him. Of course, he's angered immensely for what Elliot has done to him, but could this new novel actually be a message for him? And in the second part, Elliot's mother takes center stage at her younger son's funeral. Elliot has died, leaving his mother to continue in her struggle to reconcile her son's literary and vividly queer life with what she knows from life in the Australian rural town where Elliot grew up. Ultimately, she finds a sort of strength to claim her own influence on her son's career. This compelling, insightful, dazzling book will delight readers and stop them in their tracks (and not at the distracting typographical errors).	2001-04-10

Based on facts gleaned through letters and Dickinson's poetry, the story elaborates on Dickinson's 10-month school career, on her passions for women and for men, and on her final, ailing years. Like Cunningham's &quot;The Hours&quot; and Zackheim's &quot;Violette's Embrace&quot;, it's a wonderful tribute to a woman whose true life is obscured by history. Farr's rendering of Dickinson's school year brought to mind Rosemary Manning's &quot;The Chinese Garden&quot; and Dorothy Strachey Bussy's &quot;Olivia&quot;.	2001-04-09

The two have what they think is a one-night stand, but Brad is smitten and Kevin goes along for the ride, and finds himself awakening to what life can offer, and not just in material wealth. But can this relationship work when Brad is fighting to keep his media empire and Kevin doesn't even have his own source of income? I was expecting, like some reviewers, another fluffy gay novel, but what I found was a more intelligent, fluffy gay novel. It's a surprising read because it doesn't end with a clich, happy ending, but rather with a more realistic and hopeful one. I didn't become enthralled with the story until towards page 100, and by then, I was hooked. For those who enjoyed &quot;Sex Toys of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot;, then this will certainly fit the bill.	2001-04-07

Weaving back and forth across time and weaving the various threads of family members together, it gives a stunning portrait of its various individuals and the whole family stuck on the boundary of heritage, of class, of race, of religion. There's Miguel Chico who's avoiding his sexuality as he struggles to balance his Mexican identity with his American education. His father Miguel Grande loves his wife and his mistress equally, and when he's forced to choose, he finds he cannot. And Miguel Grande's brother Felix who is unable to escape his passions for young men, which brings his life to a violent end. And throughout it all, there's the women in the Angel family who are steady, patient, and at the heart of the family. It's a beautiful, poetic series of snapshots that flows with the reader like the water the desert lacks.	2001-04-02

This dark, insistent play is about two American women who travel to Bosnia to help women confront the atrocities they faced and the atrocities they experienced. Ultimately the two Americans find themselves changing in unexpected ways as they face their ill-conceived notions of what it means to be a refugee. It's a powerful work about the endurance of human spirit, about the effects of war on the women who don't fight the war but only clean up afterwards. As much as I like this play and find it important, I was less moved by it overall than moved by the ideas behind the play. And yet, I find it lingering in my periphery as a reminder, which I think is the point.	2001-04-02

He's befriended by the androgynous Kasper (a karate instructor) and Kasper's friends, and by some other guys at a local gym. Among this group of friends lurks the man who attacked Jip. This thoroughly engrossing story is told from the point of view of one of Kasper's (and Jip's) housemates who is piecing together Jip's story. It's an amazing book that I couldn't put down even once after I began. This would make a brilliant movie, too, rather like &quot;The Vanishing&quot; (Dutch, not American, version).	2001-03-31

Jonathan finds himself more and more under the control of Richard, who destroys anyone who comes between them. Richard is a creature of seething anger, and somehow taps into some paranormal force, which he uses for his own ends. Jonathan must find a way to stop Richard before he can continue his wicked ways.

The young woman was a prostitute and a junkie who was rejected by her judgmental parents, all of which gives Kate a plethora of suspects. During the investigation, Kate has a brief liaison with a woman from the lesbian bar, and ultimately reconnects with the lesbian community, which she hadn't done for years. And when Kate discovers who killed the young woman, it's a jolt to the reader as well, even if, like myself, you suspected it. Forrest is a gifted writer, showing in her second Delafield mystery the reasons why she has such a devoted following.	2001-03-28

The descendants struggle to survive the elements, as well as their own mutations and infertility. Anas is not entirely male or female, so she's seen as a threat to the community since she's also a lesbian. In order to survive, the community instituted a breeding program which states that all women need to have children. With the unearthing of the remains of one of the planet's native population, Anas finds what could be the keys to the community's survival, but fear of the unknown and of difference rules here, and Anas might not survive to implement the changes. It's an intriguing story of third genders, that is confused by the shifting viewpoints and time periods (Anas's time, the time when the native population's civilization was beginning to end, and the time when the humans were first struggling to survive on the planet). The other storylines give information that Anas could never know, so it's almost necessary to make the novel work, and I found myself more interested in the third gender information than about the characters and the interplay between them. It's overall a great book, but the varying of the viewpoints might put off some readers.	2001-03-28

It's about the life of an intelligent, shy guy trying to fit in with his peers, and finding that he really doesn't want to. Charlie is befriended by an older girl (who Charlie has a crush on) and by her gay brother. Through those two close friends Charlie learns more about life in general, and learns ways to live and experience fully. It's a remarkable novel, not only for the poignant intelligence, but also for the way it deals with the issue of being gay: it's just a detail, not a major issue. And it's also amazing how Charlie learns about himself and his own hidden past, and how it's conveyed to the readers. &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; reminded me a bit of the movie &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, where an intelligent kid takes big steps in growing up.	2001-03-28

Her lover Lola tells her she's now seeing someone else (briefly), and this sends Catherine into a depression. She sleeps indiscriminately with both women and men she encounters, acting out her detachment and self-destruction. She ends with Lucien, a man who's her equal in beauty, intelligence, and solitude. Their doomed affair must inevitably end, and each must regain their life back, hopefully before they destroy each other. Maso's style is lyrical and erotic, and is rooted in Gertrude Stein and Virginia Woolf. It's a novel of longing, of desire, of France, and of the world of writers. It also reminded me somewhat of Violette Leduc's work, where it's an honest, unflinching writing that does not shy away from personal pain. Quite electrifying.	2001-03-20

It's a languid, very Southern story of a lonely young boy figuring out his place in the world, and the book is considered one of the classic gay novels. Capote's style here in his first book is a bit awkward in places, but the story is compelling. I think Donald Rawley's &quot;The Night Bird Cantata&quot; will appeal to those who love this, too.	2001-03-19

The main character, Jeanette, grows up in a firmly religious household and seems destined to become a missionary. As she interacts more with the world outside the religious community, she finds other avenues of possibilities, and as she matures, she realizes her desires for other women, much to the horror of her family and community. Winterson's style is magical, and the structure of this novel arounds chapters in the Bible is brilliant. I didn't find myself as drawn into the book as I was with Winterson's &quot;The Passion&quot; or &quot;The World and Other Places&quot;, but that certainly it's a detraction.	2001-03-18

The criminal mastermind behind the revolutionary plot turns out to be someone both Tuppence and Tommy considered an ally. It's a fast-paced thriller that's a delight to read and attempt to figure out before all is revealed. I had some suspicions, and I deduced the culprit just as the duo did! Agatha Christie's books are a stimulating, joyous read.	2001-03-17

Sasha (&quot;Shy&quot;) left abruptly years ago, and Alta still hasn't gotten over her. When Shy's mother has a stroke, Shy is forced to come back. The out lesbian Alta and the pregnant Shy struggle to reconnect and together they face the things they left unsaid between them, as well as the secrets harbored in Shy's family. After Shy's mother dies, Shy discovers her true heritage and finds herself finally understanding her mother. By being witness to this, Alta connects to aspects of herself and her relationships (lovers, her mother, her friends). The story is beautifully rendered, and reminded me of Allison Green's &quot;Half-moon Scar&quot; and Aryeh Lev Stollman's &quot;The Far Euphrates&quot;.

There's powerful stuff here about family betrayals and about art consuming one's life. I felt so much promise with the story, and yet it seemed to lack closure at the end of the novel. The family estrangements are (rightfully) unresolved, but I was expecting a different ending. Also, I noticed too many editorial errors which I found distracting.	2001-03-13

Einar and Greta Wegener are both Danish painters (Greta's lived in California for a while), and Einar's fame is rising while his wife's is stalled. Greta asks Einar to model for her in women's clothes, and this instance awakens something in Einar, and thus is born Lili. Greta recognizes this awakening and encourages her husband in his transformation. Ebershoff admits it's a fictionalized account, and as an inspired work, it's eloquently rendered. Like other reviewers, I felt certain aspects could've been elaborated upon, but overall the book worked for me. I was especially fascinated by Greta's relationship with Lili as time went on, how each suddenly found herself on a different path that didn't include the other. A sad, beautiful tale about loving fully and about by freeing those we love, we free ourselves.	2001-03-13

Charlie, a 6th-grader and habitual liar, acquires a magical skull that causes him to be unable to lie. His family is affected by this, as well as his friends, and later other members of their community. It's a poignant tale of learning the power of truth and learning to deal with its consequences. There are serious topics in this book (cancer, homosexuality, environmental protection), and it's all handled clearly and positively. I certainly recommend it to adventurous younger readers, as well as older readers wishing to reminisce about those magical, younger days.	2001-03-04

With the movie and the TV miniseries both available, it's superfluous to state the plot, so. And the story of a young boy becoming a hero isn't new, but the vivid geographies of Dune and the subtle complexities of life on Dune and in the Imperium are fascinating, and all make this a science fiction masterwork. It's got something for everyone: political intrigue, warfare, romance, evil vs good, spirituality. But it's definitely the Fremen and the planet Arrakis (Dune) that cativate me.

Lurie befriended Merrill, and through him Jackson, and was a witness to their love affair, its ups and downs, and Merrill's literary success with his epic poem &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot;. Lurie gives insight to the epic's origins by describing the couple's sessions with a ouija board. She also elaborates on Jackson's influence on the epic, a fact which the world seems to want to ignore. Merrill and Jackson's relationship deteriorated as the epic poem gained in popularity, and by the time of Merrill's death in 1995, the two men were hardly speaking. Lurie has written a poignant memoir of her friends, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and yet it seemed distant, almost through glass. It was as if the book is just a series of thoughts about the two men, without even attempting to make us feel as close to them as Lurie did. I definitely do recommend it to fans of Merrill, as well as those interested in the lives of artists and writers.	2001-03-03

I'm not familiar with William Carlos Williams, whom she credits as an influence, but I am familiar with Gertrude Stein and Virginia Woolf, whose influences are apparent in the novels I've read by Maso and in the techniques she uses to express. With each essay I was astonished at the innovative and dazzling approaches to language. In the essay &quot;The Re-introduction of Color&quot;, Maso explores her struggle to find her writing self against the pressures of conformity and convention. This book is inspirational, educational, exquisite. Any writers or serious readers looking for ways to shake the trees of literature's stale greats will delight in this collection of essays, and each reader will find herself or himself challenged, seduced, and ultimately released.	2001-02-26

It's an inspirational look at how we can change our lives by looking inward to our hearts, minds, and souls to create a heightened awareness of ourselves and our place in the world. Sometimes the language seems simplistic, but this actually helps convey the messages the authors want to tell us. That when we're angry or upset, there are underlying reasons and causes that often have nothing to do with the incidents that caused the emotions. With a mix of humor and universal spirituality, Kraus and Borja have given us a book for transforming our lives from the inside out. There's also a marvelous analysis of the death of Diana, the former Princess of Wales, in terms of modern mythology, and in terms of why this affected the entire world, while the death of Mother Teresa had less impact. Give your soul a treat!	2001-02-24

I found it wildly entertaining and engrossing, and so funny! The story centers on Mitch, a Toronto writer who makes his money being an office temp and by writing gay porn, but he dreams of being a famous screenwriter. When a mysterious woman brings him a story idea for a movie she wants to make, Mitch thinks it's his big break. But then he discovers that the story idea is based on a real life murder mystery, and that the mysterious woman isn't who she said she was. The adorable Dunford gives us great commentary on the art world (paintings, movies, acting, writing) that's as witty as it is intelligent. I wish this story were being made into a movie. It would certainly be one of the best comedies!	2001-02-20

This collection of poems and autobiographical stories is full of politics, poignant observations, philosophies, all to an indigenous beat, and all bearing witness to the madness of our world. And especially to the atrocities done in this world, past and present. By letting us see through her eyes, Harjo makes the politics personal, and brings the novice reader into her fiery views, making us feel and see in different ways. I was most affected by the prose stories between the poems. And judging by the other reviews, this isn't even Harjo's best work overall!	2001-02-20

A few of the stories seemed flat, but overall this book is a potent mix. I especially loved &quot;The Story&quot; (about a woman making a new life for herself after maneuvering a wife out of her life), the title story (about a mother who's helping her daughter become a man), and &quot;Rowing to Eden&quot; (about a woman with breast cancer, her lesbian best friend, and the woman's husband who all find their relationship shifting into new territory). I think Bloom's capacity for expressing through small details is exquisitely evident in this collection. She has a knack and that makes these stories come alive. Even with my hesitations about a few stories, I still believe this book is worth going out of one's way for.	2001-02-18

His series of poems about Jeffrey Dahmer is rather thought-provoking. For me, his poetry doesn't have an emotional impact, but rather a mental one. I prefer fiery poems, that rattle my brain and shake my worldview. Gunn achieves that in some poems, but not all in this collection. I can see why he's highly acclaimed, though. It's just not my taste.	2001-02-18

Here, in &quot;The PowerBook&quot;, she has created a book that contains a doomed love affair, potent observations about time and space, autobiographical snapshots, and vivid imagery. It's as if the narrator {sometimes called Ali, and later referred to as Orlando (a reference to Virginia Woolf)} and the lover create a world via the internet, where they change gender and geographies and centuries with ease. It reminded me of Woolf's &quot;Orlando&quot;, as well as &quot;Prozac Highway&quot; by Persimmon Blackbridge, which includes a wonderful internet romance. &quot;The PowerBook&quot; is delightfully innovative in incorporating internet imagery into the book, and the love affair is quite beautifully written. I don't think the book ended well, especially in the last chapter section, where it seems to meander and then snaps back to a quick end. This seemed to dilute the novel, and left me a bit bewildered. I did love the novel overall, though. Winterson's use of language is always a treat.	2001-02-16

She was badly burned as a child, and subsequently never made many friends. Among the living, that is. Finch has been able to talk with the dead for a long time, and considers them her friends. She does things for the dead that they cannot do, thereby helping them be released from their burdens. The closest thing she has to a friend among the living is Leonard, who's the sheriff, but Finch seems to have a crush on one of the ghosts, Lucy. Through the tale of Finch's scars, and the hidden scars of the town, Reynolds explores the power of healing and the power of touch. This book is simply gorgeous overall. I love the way Reynolds also sneaks in social tolerance after one of the dead is discovered to have been a transvestite in life, and the whole town turns against him, even though he's dead. He was a good person, but a tiny detail made a difference in the town's view. The novel might have been a bit longer to better develop some of these concepts and connections, but its length doesn't take away from the power of the novel, because by leaving some connections to the reader, Reynolds gives a nod to readers' intelligence. Not everything needs to be spelled out.	2001-02-14

When she becomes pregnant by her step-nephew and prayer partner, things shift not only in her life, but also in the community itself. Her son Canaan is born, and heralded as the new messiah by some of the community due to his birth defect (his hands are joined). Ninah struggles to bring true joy to her own life, her son's life, and to bring peace and truth back to her community. Reynolds challenges rigid, blind spiritual indoctrination in her second novel, using her crisp and evocative style. I was reminded of Anita Diamant's &quot;The Red Tent&quot; because of the strong feminine spirituality present, as well as the questioning of blind faith. This is the most well-known of Reynolds's books, but I feel it's not her strongest.	2001-02-12

She escapes into the woods, and lives there for a time until she is 'rescued'. She hears voices and sees people that aren't really there, and that becomes her private reality which helps and heals her. Jael's journey is not only to heal her wounds from incest, but also to find her own voice that is not clouded by other people's views. Sheri Reynolds has crafted a massively moving portrait of a woman finding a way to her true self, that is crisp and gem-like in its brilliance. It's more than a story of an incest survivor. It's about all survivors, those who've been led to believe one thing, but know in their hearts something different, something more true. Like &quot;When Rabbit Howls&quot;, this book is a potent story of survival with spiritual leanings that leaves the reader nearly breathless. A beautiful novel.	2001-02-11

Through the almost madcap story of Jack Gladney, a Nazi professor, and his patchwork family of kids from previous marriages, DeLillo presents a concise evaluation of mass consumerism and the fear of death. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the characters seem almost two-dimensional, but it serves a purpose. It was during the episode of the airborne toxic event that I connected to DeLillo's use of modern absurdity to make us look at ourselves and our culture in a new fashion.	2001-02-06

Flip's psychic boyfriend Warren doesn't fully support his fledgling acting career. Rosie, Flip's sister, is juggling what could be her first union strike with her so-called dating life. While Flip and Warren's relationship struggles, Warren's estranged sister sends her biracial daughter into Warren's life, causing him to adjust to life in totally new ways. Kranz changes viewpoints through the story, making it a mosaic of life in New York City, and this is one of the strongest aspects of the story. The most potent aspect of the story is Warren and Flip's love. It's incredibly tangible in its constant variations from positive to negative to inbetween. Like real life, their love is inconsistent with one saying something honestly to the other, and watching as it's misunderstood. And it's this honesty that resonates with the reader, drawing us further and further into the book until it's unquestionable that this book would be set aside. If you want to give yourself a fulfilling, joyful treat, grab this book and settle into a comfortable chair.	2001-02-05

When Walter's brother dies young, his entire family, as well as Walter's own friends, are affected in ways even they don't anticipate. Hamilton's writing is eloquent, although sometimes she veers into being tedious and saccharine, but overall the story is marvelous in its depth, pacing, and ideas. I can certainly see where some readers would be put off by the almost plodding nature of the storyweaving, but it takes on a rhythm of its own, and lends a semblance of grace to the book.	2001-01-30

This story of Arctic researchers stranded on an iceberg with a timebomb, as well as a psychotic killer, is quite fun, but I felt it was almost stereotypical. I didn't figure out who the killer was, but I fairly knew it would all end well. Granted, this book was originally published in 1976 (under the title &quot;Prison of Ice&quot;), so it's a bit dated, but still. It's an exciting read, and for mind-candy it's quite great. Even though I was unimpressed by this book, I will definitely read others by Koontz because his style is quite compelling, and that was what I was captivated by while reading.	2001-01-30

Nicolson gives us a full sense of Woolf's history, as well as the influences on her life, her art, and on her death. The final chapter where he describes the final days before Woolf's suicide is quite moving and informative. I finished the book with an even greater love of Woolf and her work, as well as a deeper understanding of her ways.	2001-01-16

With authors new and others familiar, this book, edited by Rowe, is a marvelous addition to any horror fan's shelf, gay or straight. I will admit that there are a few stories that seem out of place or are outright vapid, but overall I enjoyed this collection, especially since it introduced me to new writers whom I've not read. One story is about lesbians, but the majority contain gay men. From eroticism to terror to magical realism, this collection runs the gamut of horror fiction, offering up a smorgasbord of dark delights.	2001-01-15

Re-reading it now, after many years, was a joy. Following Maurice's failed relationship with Clive, which ends in Clive's marriage, to Maurice's encounter with Clive's groundskeeper Alec, we watch Maurice battle the will of society to fit in, marry, and produce heirs, and ultimately decide to follow his own heart and embark on a life with Alec. Even Clive admonishes Maurice's decision at the end, and yet we're left with a sense that Clive is envious. While it's about being true to one's self no matter what society expects, it's also a potent commentary on class and on what it means to be an outsider in the pre-World War 1 era. A classic novel, that is happily listed among the 100 Best Lesbian and Gay Novels.	2001-01-08

With almost every adventure, Christie users other literary detectives as inspirations for the Beresfords to solve crimes, including her own Hercule Poirot. I haven't read Christie in ages, and it was a delight to do so again. Her plotting is marvelous. My favorite thing about Agatha Christie's works is her ability to portray human nature in all its details, thereby providing clues to motives. I learn a lot from her books!	2001-01-08

I am continually amazedat Bechdel's ability to educate readers through her characters,especially about grassroots politics and modern dyke life. My favoritepart of this particular book is about Lois and her attraction to afemale-to-male transsexual. Wait, it's really about how Mo and Sydneyhave...  while each is at work. Umm, no, it's...

His father is an Afrikaaner general, and Marnus parrots his family's beliefs on race, religion, and class, until a visit from a Chilean general to his family's house for a week forces Marnus to several realizations about his country, his family, and himself. By telling the story from Marnus's young viewpoint, Behr creates a fascinating portrait of apartheid in South Africa, and of the reality of whites there who are blind to their own cruelties. The reader is drawn into making her/his own decisions about the various hypocritical statements. This story is ultimately about the loss of innocence. Behr also weaves flashforwards about Marnus fighting in the Angolan war in the early 1980s, showing us the future effects. A searing and vivid story that brings the reader further and further in until it's impossible to leave without knowing how it ends.	2001-01-07

Bell's book imagines Psappha's life, keeping rather true to the facts that are known. Psappha is exiled from her homeland of Lesbos, and ends up in what's now Sicily. She marries a man, becomes lovers with an African warrior queen (Gyla), and has a daughter. After the death of her beloved husband, Psappha begins teaching and becomes the famous Poetess we now know her to be. She and her entourage travel back to Lesbos to continue the teachings, and Psappha lives her life there with her African queen, and in Gyla's absence, becomes lovers with a fisherman. Bell gives us a heroic, yet tragic end for Psappha and her beloved warrior queen, which feels a bit melodramatic. Bell writes beautifully, and several passages in the novel are rather evocative of life in Psappha's time, and yet this style isn't continuous throughout. Overall, this book is a delightful and heartening story of one woman's journey to happiness.	2001-01-05

If you can imagine TV's Aaron Spelling writing his brand of witty and campy fun in an English town in the 1920s &amp; 30s, then you can imagine Benson's Lucia series. I'd often heard how great the series was, and finally got around to reading the first book. What a delight! It's been ages since I've read a book that simply glided off the page. Lucia is the center of Riseholme's cultural life, and without her, life just couldn't be the same, right? With her husband Peppino, and her sidekick Georgie (so repressed he's nearly an origami flamingo), Lucia controls the fads and fashions of Riseholme. When a diva opera singer moves into town, Lucia finds herself knocked off her throne, and all but declares war on the upstart. Full of devious gossip and fascinating characters, this story is wonderfully enjoyable, as well as incredibly intelligent in its rendering of small town life. I can hardly wait to read the entire series, or see the &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; miniseries.	2001-01-05

Paul tries to kill himself and confesses to Agatha, and the two piece together Elisabeth's treachery, leading to the story's final, implosive end.

The mystery plot begins strong, yet it plummets to a disappointing clich ending. Justice is hired to write a book refuting claims that a dead Hollywood star was a pederast. He finds the star's daughter dead and seeks her killer. Along the way he stumbles into a boy trade reaching into the highest levels of Los Angeles's social structure. The problem I had with the plot was the actual culprits and their reasons for doing bad things. It was just such a let-down from what I was expecting from Wilson's level of excellence. I am happy with the characterization of Justice, most especially his achievements on the road to recovery. I hope the next in the series overcomes this stumble.	2000-12-28

Her lover Meredith is suspected of the crime, so their friend Lindsay Gordon returns to Britain to clear Meredith. As Lindsay untangles the web of the British literary world, she alarms the killer who in turn targets her. In her fifth Gordon mystery, McDermid has crafted a marvelous and enchanting book that will keep readers guessing until the final dozen pages. McDermid's take on the literary world is a strong point to the story, as is her characterizations, all of which is why she is one of the best in the mystery field.	2000-12-28

Joss Moody, the celebrated African-Scottish jazz trumpeter, dies, and his widow retreats to their remote Scottish cottage to mourn. Their adopted son Colman, and the rest of the world, are shocked to discover that Joss was biologically female. Colman spirals into anger and falls victim to a tabloid journalist intent on a gossipy bio of Joss Moody, but he ultimately comes to terms with his father and himself. What resonated the most with me was the focus on Colman coming to a new realization of his relationship with his father. Kay's style is wonderful, and justifies the Lambda Literary Award it won.	2000-12-27

Well, after finishing the book, I think it's mostly due to talent, although having famous parents may've been an asset, so. Although he doesn't really cover new ground plot- or storywise, Rice creates a fascinating web of intrigue among the various characters that speeds to its evocative ending. He definitely writes with that Louisiana-gothic feel, with an incredible emotional darkness that reminded me of Patrick Redmond and Scott Heim somewhat. This novel has an amazing texture that would lend itself nicely to a big budget movie. Christopher Rice has certainly proven himself with this book that he has inherited the talents of his parents.	2000-12-27

This collection of his works (some translated into English for the first time) is an amazing taste of his burgeoning style. Casey was a friend of Virgilio Piera and Severo Sarduy, so I was eager to read these stories. He created tight worlds that convey much in their brevity. Stand-out stories for me include &quot;Homecoming&quot; (where a man returns to Cuba where he's arrested and tortured for unknown reasons), &quot;The Execution&quot; (similar to &quot;Homecoming&quot; where a man is arrested for a crime he didn't commit, and yet he never speaks a word in his defense), and &quot;Piazza Margana&quot; (which is a brilliant love story in the style of Piera or Poppy Z. Brite). Some stories are difficult to fathom, and yet it's evident the potency Casey had in his writing, especially when writing about his Cuban heritage and his ambivalent sexuality.	2000-12-16

Coyote is a member of Taste This, whose book &quot;Boys Like Her&quot; is still one of my favorites. Two of my favorites in the book are &quot;You're Not in Kansas Anymore&quot; where the narrator (Coyote) faces the name she was given at birth and finds one that reflects her real self, and the last story, &quot;Red Sock Circle Dance&quot;, which concerns families of choice and a sort of passing the queer torch to a younger generation of queers.

Stephen then begins an inner journey in the world where he finds God's true nature as well as his own. Flesh's style is potent and beautiful, and I found the book quite mesmerizing, and yet certain sections seemed to need more fleshing out. As perfectly as I could visualize this story as a movie, I never entirely connected to Stephen as a person.	2000-12-16

It's as fun and sexy as his second book! Alex Young begins working on a soap series, and ends up dealing with a starlet boyfriend, his public outing in a gossip rag, and his lingering feelings for Nick, the man Alex has always loved. Like Orland Outland's &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot;, this book includes commentary on gay culture within a fluffy story of gay men's romance. A really great read and perfect for a relaxing night at home.	2000-12-14

Highsmith's style is incredibly captivating. Tom Ripley is sent to Europe to coax Dickie Greenleaf home. While there, Ripley becomes enamored with Dickie and his lifestyle, and in a passionate rage, Ripley kills him. Ripley begins living as Dickie, until the police begin circling closer to the truth, and Ripley uses every talent he has to elude them. The precursor to such books as Michael Pye's &quot;Taking Lives&quot;, Highsmith's noir thriller is a fascinating character study of a man intent on changing the circumstances of his life at any cost.	2000-12-14

Lurking dangers affect each character in different ways. The most striking thing about her writing is the use of powerful metaphors that are almost subtle. Check out &quot;Bromeliads&quot;, &quot;The Little Winter&quot;, and the title story to taste what Joy Williams is about.	2000-12-14

But it certainly is fun! Liam is getting over his lover's death and begins entertaining himself with answering personal ads. This progresses to placing elaborate personal ads just to see whom he'll attract. Through the hot sex and the wild stalker, Liam finds out a lot about himself as well as the nature of those answering personal ads. Hartnett has a great commentary on gay culture (the story is set in London, but it's pertinent to America as well). It's definitely a typically British story, so it might be difficult for some American audiences looking for fluffy, bright gay stories, but it's quite worth reading if for nothing else but the wonderfully sexy trysts.	2000-12-14

These tales seem like modern faerie tales without the classic imagery. Or rather, with the classic imagery shifted. In &quot;Cold&quot;, an ice princess discovers true love in a desert land. In my favorite in the collection, &quot;Christ in the House of Martha and Mary&quot;, a cook finds the meaning of art in life. These tales of extremes of emotions, temperatures, lives are full of joy and life, and make many a reader celebrate. This will certainly not be the last book by Byatt I'll read.	2000-12-14

Some of the violence and events seem almost gratuitous, but they fit in the grand scheme of the book and its political statements about America's homophobia in the 1980s. Nick and Jeff end up on the run from homophobic cops, and must evade every attempt to apprehend them. With a nearly &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;-type ending, the story leaves it open-ended. The sex scenes are quite hot, too.	2000-12-14

This story set in North Carolina centers on Trevor who is revisiting the house where his father killed his mother and brother and himself, but not Trevor. While there, he meets Zach, a hacker on the run, and the two fall in love and face the ghosts in the house, and in their pasts, together. Full of electric sensuality and vivid horrors, the book increases pace the deeper one reads, further and further drawing the reader in until it's impossible to let go. This might be the most accessible of her books, but I have yet to read them all, so. If it's possible to live in a book, that book would definitely be written by Poppy Brite.	2000-11-27

Since this is the first Vonnegut book I've read, I don't know if it's his best, but I certainly think it's a fascinating read. The use of a cat's cradle string-game as a metaphor for various ideas and things is quite astute and sparklingly new, even though the book is from 1963. This book is definitely for anyone interested in zany literature that challenges the status quo, of any sort.	2000-11-27

In league with Marge Piercy's &quot;Woman on the Edge of Time&quot;, Monique Wittig's &quot;Les Guerilleres&quot;, and Margaret Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;, Le Guin's book cloaks an intelligent analysis of gender and sexual roles in a beguiling story set on another world, which is reminiscent of aspects of our own. Not only is the book captivating, but it's highly thought-provoking, which can't always be said for much science fiction.	2000-11-20

Although the historical fiction parts of the novel sometimes are quite dry, it's the analysis and thought-provoking reflections that come from it, especially towards the end of the book, that make this book one of the 100 Best Gay &amp; Lesbian Novels. Including political and social influences, as well as Hadrian's relationship with Antinous, Yourcenar crafted a marvelous fictional memoir of a man mired in his own life.	2000-11-20

This was also my introduction to his work, so I found Ozsvath's introductory biography and Turner's analysis of Jozsef's poetry quite welcome and insightful. Jozsef's poetry is lyrically balanced and a beautiful representation of the dark and light contained in one's inner self. His injection of politics and his personal life into the poems is masterful and captivating. Be sure to check out &quot;With a Pure Heart&quot;, &quot;Ode&quot;, and &quot;Lay Your Hand&quot; (those being among my favorites). Any reader interested in the effects of mental illness on an artist's work will find this collection fascinating and intense.	2000-11-13

I found the story utterly captivating and compelling. Beginning in the later years of the American Civil War through the 1920s, we follow the life of Augustus Boyd, a.k.a Dr August. He falls in love with an ex-slave named Isaac, eventually convincing him to make it an intimate relationship. August becomes an improvisational pianist, inspired by his &quot;spirits&quot;, with Isaac as his manager. While on a voyage to Europe, Isaac is enraptured with a white governess, and breaks off the love affair with August to pursue Alice. Isaac &amp; August remain friends &amp; business partners as Isaac weds Alice, and the two have children. The love triangle is a strain on all, and it snaps finally in Constantinople, when Isaac meddles in August's new love affair with a teen. The outcome of a tragedy causes the destruction of the trio, and its reconfiguration into a strange new alliance, without one of its core members. Beautifully exploring issues of race, sexuality, class, sprituality, and the notion of love, &quot;The Notorious Dr August&quot; is a magnificent story including fully-fleshed characters and a delightful rendering of history. Bram rocks!	2000-11-11

Macy lives at the house Dotty was painting. Macy becomes Dotty's nurse after she leaves the hospital, and the two embark on a love affair. The past histories of both women creep back into their lives and threaten to destroy what's being born. Schutzer's circular and nonlinear story is full of potent writing and moving descriptions of the past pain and vivid silences both women have endured. And the surprise connection between Dotty and Macy is beautifully crafted. Schutzer's style reminded me a bit of Scott Heim, but not as dark. Any reader who's a fan of such emotionally charged works as Emma Donoghue's &quot;Hood&quot; and Alison Green's &quot;Half-moon Scar&quot; will adore this novel. This is one of my favorite novels of 2000!	2000-11-08

After his second marriage implodes, he retreats to his former home, a Quaker town in Pennsylvania, where he is forced to reflect on the whole of his life: his first marriage, his affairs, his inability to emote truthfully. Years ago, Stephen &amp; his first wife travelled to the Canary Islands, where Stephen had an affair with a young man. After that ended in disaster, his first wife died, leaving Stephen confused and adrift. In the Quaker town, with family, and with friends in the form of a gay couple and a German refugee, Stephen  confronts himself and ultimately finds inner peace.

Kat struggles with her memories of Caroline and with the chance of a sort of catharsis that Jennifer offers.

He falls in with a wrong crowd, and is mistaken for a saint, which becomes his downfall when the deranged pimp discovers 'she' is really a 'he'. Sarah is eventually rescued by his first pimp (a real gem called Glad). LeRoy's exciting rhythms and talents with words and pacing are certain to draw the reader to continue. It's a wonderful beginning for a young writer. It's certainly one of the most memorable books of the year, but it won't make my top ten for the year. Well worth reading, don't mistake me.

After Tom wakes from a coma, the duo find even more clues pointing in many directions. And when a drag queen friend of Tom's is killed, they know they're targets themselves. The plot is action-packed and hardly gives the reader time to breathe, and yet I never felt involved in the story. Of course, this is the first Zubro I've read, so that's part of it, but each book in a series ought to bring the reader into the series and entice. The solving of the bombings and murder was well crafted and believable, and Zubro certainly is a great writer. This just may not be his best overall, so.	2000-10-31

The two women help the girl and make her like themselves, as vampires. The girl takes the name Gilda (from one of the two) and spends the next 200 years searching for a place to call home, for love, and for greater meaning in the world. Gomez has created an amazing tale that is utterly intriguing. I wanted to love it more, but sometimes the story almost worked against itself by moving too quickly from time period to time period without giving us (and Gilda) a chance to really connect. I heartily recommend this book because of the many thought-provoking points Gomez introduces. It's quite a tasty story.	2000-10-31

Drawing from his history with the Violet Quill, Picano has woven a clever and amazing book that soars as much as it bewilders the reader. The mesmerizing plot drew me further and further into the book, and yet the ending seemed out of place, leaving me unfulfilled. I love the parts about the fictional authors and history especially. This book is most recommended to anyone interested in gay literature's history (even though it's not non-fiction), but be warned that the title is &quot;The Book of Lies&quot;, and it lives up to it.	2000-10-31

One can easily see the influence this experiment had on her later works, chiefly &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; and &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;.

It's the story of a boy with exceptional intelligence and creativity who cannot relate to kids his own age nor to adults set on treating him as a little kid.

With clear and concise language, she revisits the beginnings of the movement, and tells us where it is now. She also succintly explains why feminism is not anti-male, anti-sex, or anti-family, but rather feminism is the struggle against rigid sexism in patriarchal cultures. Despite its plague of editorial errors, the book is highly recommended for the non-academic language and for the encouraging message hooks offers us.	2000-10-14

Together with their mother, their  grandmother, and 2 friends of Declan's, she takes care of Declan in what  might be his final days. These 6 separate worlds collide into and  reconfigure the estrangements of the past years. Toibin's potent rendering  of these people coming to terms with themselves and each other is  incredibly moving and highly evocative. He skilfully shows the power  personal stories have on healing rifts between people. This is one of the  most beautiful novels I've read this year.	2000-09-19

The event in this book is the couple's anniversary, which corresponds with  a solar eclipse. The author skilfully explores the nature of love, and the  nature of women and men. Richard Dalloway adores his wife Clarissa, but he  also loves Robert Davies. The three paths converge and come to a sort of  beautiful moment, framed by the eclipse. It may be not quite as evocative  and potent as Cunningham's &quot;The Hours&quot; or Woolf's books, but this  book is still exceptional and beautiful. A book to enjoy and revisit.	2000-09-19

Through her interactions with fellow patients and the hospital staff,  Veronika examines the nature of death and life, and reawakens to the joy of  living in each moment. Like in faerie tales, the language and story of the  book are easy to read. But don't let its simplicity fool you. Covering the  way of life in our modern world, its effect on us, the nature of what's  commonly referred to as 'insanity', and more, Coelho has crafted a  delicious gem that is heartening and celebratory. This is the second book  I've read by him, and it certainly won't be the last.	2000-09-18

She doesn't love him, and doesn't feel complete until she meets a  woman from her past, Toni. Only with her does she feel whole again. Written  in a sparse and evocative style, Wilhelm's novel is a joy to read. Entirely  compelling and beautifully crafted.	2000-09-18

She  eventually comes to work for a woman named Violet on Summit Avenue  translating fairy tales from German. Violet has secrets, and over a space  of time, she begins to tell the young woman her secrets and the two have  one night of passion. The confused Kathrin flings herself into marriage  with an ambitious young man who fathers her child. She eventually leaves  her husband and searches for Violet. Like a modern adaption of a fairy  tale, Sharratt's novel is lush and metaphoric in places, and is evocative  of the early part of the 1900s, right before and during World War I. It  reminded me of Emma Donoghue's &quot;Kissing the Witch&quot;, which also  used fairy tales in a sort of modern retelling. I was especially impressed  with Sharratt's use of the maiden/mother/crone dynamic. If you enjoyed  &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; by Sarah Waters, then you certainly love  this book.	2000-09-09

A young teacher who's been involved with one young lad in  America, flees to France to research Gertrude Stein's nephew Allan. While  there, the teacher becomes enchanted with the 15-year old Stephane, with  whom he travels to Southern France. This is quite in the tradition of works  like Mann's &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, and quite lovely. It just bothers  me, this fixation on young boys which is borderline pedophilia.	2000-09-05

Now if only his plots could sustain them. The story of one lover caring for  another through AIDS is not entirely new, but here White presents it in a  more unflinching way than possibly previously read. For most of the novel,  I found myself swinging from bored by the slow-moving story to enraptured  by the language, but when I reached the last third of the novel I became  more involved with the characters and the story, where I couldn't put down  the novel. White's lack of chronological timekeeping is a nuisance, by the  way. Like some works of art, the novel is quite beautiful, but inaccesible  to a lot of people. I didn't get what all other readers are getting from  this novel. Yes, it's beautiful. But it's also tedious and lacking.	2000-09-05

Shaughnessy's use  and restructuring of language is highly refreshing, with imagery and  wordings reminiscent of Ben Marcus, Tori Amos, C. D. Wright, and Neil  Gaiman.

Using threads from such writers as Poppy Z. Brite  and Dennis Cooper, he weaves through a bevy of subjects, mostly dark and  possibly degenerate. I thoroughly loved his story &quot;Taking Care  of&quot;, and was entertained by most of the book.

Rachel is a bright student who befriends one of the school's  rebels, Margaret. They are surrounded by teachers who dress as men and act  with stoney authority. Margaret brings a copy of \\"The Well of Loneliness\\"  into the school, and eventually gets caught with another girl, thereby  implicating Rachel in her activities. Rachel is faced with the hypocrisy of  the school's staff and with her own growing sensuality, and ultimately must  betray her friend or suffer her fate. What I found most remarkable about  the story was Manning's use of complex metaphors paralleling the story of  Adam &amp; Eve's ingestion of knowledge. It may be a dated story, but  there's still much in which to delight.	2000-08-29

The story centers on the building of the  friendship between them, with Derek's coming out to them as gay and as HIV+  and with Derek's intense attraction to one of the two boys. Boyd eloquently  portrays the struggles of Derek coming to terms with his unrequited desire  for the oldest boy, and the sometimes wavering effects of time and distance  on a friendship. He does succumb to gooey sentimentality towards the end,  but it doesn't take away from the grace of the novel.	2000-08-29

He and his friends are stunned by America's bland fashion  sense, and eventually come to San Francisco, where they find some relief.  Norvex crosses paths with Chester, a gay goth teen with poor self-image but  excellent fashion sense, and the two spark a galactic incident with their  torrid affair.

She  encounters two of her childhood friends, Gina (who now works in a lesbian  bar) and Gavin (who is dangerously anorexic), and together the three  collide into and reconcile past pain and experiences. Banding with Gina to  help Gavin, Amy rekindles her attraction to Gina. Sifting through the ebb  and flow of memory, she also comes to understand more about her continuing  self-mutilation. Echoing aspects of Eric Swanson's \\"The Boy in the Lake\\",  Green gives us a beautiful novel exploring the invisible and visible scars  we all inflict on ourselves and others. My favorite line from the novel:  &quot;The hollows of the body were what filled up with hurt, and you  couldn't starve them away.&quot;	2000-08-29

When Burke's bisexual girlfriend is killed at a gay rights rally, he vows to find the  culprit. When a serial killer starts murdering fagbashers and child  molesters by using the killing motifs of a dead friend of Burke's, Burke  wonders about how dead his friend actually is. This being the first book by  Vachss I read, I was a bit confused about the characters, but it didn't  daunt me from pursuing the story, rather it made me more intrigued about  this Burke guy and his relations with his friends. What I most like about  this book is the depths of the characters, they're fully fleshed and yet  mysterious enough to warrant curiosity. After a couple dozen pages, I  couldn't put the book down if I'd tried.	2000-08-29

While  not an uplifting story per se, this book is thoroughly enjoyable and  captivating. I was reminded in some places of &quot;Frontiers&quot; by  Michael Jensen and of &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; by Sarah Waters, where  the sense of place and time is clear and beautifully woven into a strong  story.	2000-08-29

Taking place in one year, the narrator pursues her desires  through a number of women in search of enduring love and great times. Tea  also delivers a classic line: \\"Desire... is all about stink.\\" It's a very  visceral and madcap story that certainly is aimed at a narrow audience.

Later babysitting for the family, Paige is beguiled by Fiona and desires to  know all her secrets. Like a modern-day Lolita, Paige becomes an oasis for  the troubled woman and the two are drawn into dangerous waters. With  electric characters, enchanting language, and vivid descriptions of a first  crush-turned-obsession, Summer has created an impressive and memorable  debut. The story is nearly derailed by the final chapter which switches  narrators, but that didn't really take away from the entirety of the novel.  There are tons of fascinating metaphors and the narrator's voice is so  resonant that it's easy to forgive that final stray.	2000-08-28

Shifting between the  present and the past, Quarrington explores the notions of faith in each  character's life.

O'Shea is a lesbian and former nun who  has been researching and talking to women in prisons across the United  States, especially with those on death row. This is her third book on the  subject, but the first that is told from her own point of view. With  remarkable technique, O'Shea shows us the universality of human experience  and closes the gap between us and those whose freedom has been taken away.

Like Violette Leduc, Millett charts every  moment and every emotion during the days of bliss and the days of spite in  the struggle to save the love they share, until Sita's ultimate betrayal by  leaving for a man. Included in this new edition is a portion of the elegy  Millett wrote after Sita's suicide in 1978, which is a stunning finale for  this captivating memoir.

Although not quite as redemptive as  the works of Scott Heim, Swanson's novel is still potent and lingers in the  reader's mind.

Winner of a Lambda Literary Award, Waters's  gorgeous story is equal parts historical novel and bawdy lesbian epic. My  only regret is that I waited so long to read this book!

Rick, an  atheist, is drawn to their religion and the boys are drawn to Rick's  honesty in the face of their condemnation of homosexuality. He confronts  his own prejudices while the two separate worlds collide, resulting in a  deeper understanding of his own life.

From her love affairs  with women to her failed marriage to her adoration of a gay man, she  explores her seemingly tragic life to show us the beauty in every molecule  of life.

I was utterly captivated by the story from the first page. Manning has to clear a friend of the murder charges, and the actual  murderer is not one I originally suspected! I also thoroughly enjoyed the  witty moments sprinkled throughout. Craft is definitely my favorite mystery  writer!	2000-05-17

Lahiri's eloquent storyweaving is full of humor and  confusion, and is an utter joy to read. I look forward to a full novel by  her.	2000-04-07

Like Scott Heim's books, this doesn't leave the reader with any easy answers,  but does achieve its own goal of exploring the parts of human experience  that are often overlooked.	2000-04-07

Along with the translation of his book &quot;One Thousand and One-Second Stories&quot;, this edition includes a few other stories and  poems from his later works, which thematically connect with his first book.  Such a charming and innovative way of storytelling! Each story is a jewel  unto itself which I could savor for a long time. I am quite happy I chanced  upon this collection.	2000-03-31

With so many books out there, this collection groups the various essays into sections on community,  sexuality, and spirituality. It includes a lot of the big names in queer  literature: Signorile, Sullivan, Holleran, Bawer, Boykin, and more.	2000-03-31

Avery Vincent's girlfriend is murdered and she becomes a computer hacker to find the killer. It's on par with mysteries published  by The Naiad Press, and it also deals with rape in the lesbian community.  It was a bit awkward in places, but overall it's a great beginning for a  series.	2000-03-30

Donoso's crisp voice lends an intense atmosphere to this intriguing story  about machismo versus sexual ambiguity. I am always drawn to foreign  literature, and I highly recommend Donoso, who in some ways reminds me of  Manuel Puig and his &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;.	2000-03-30

I adore this book for its fleshing out of Leduc's life. It gives a lush and warm sense of her life and her version of madness, as well as the narrator's  investigation into her own Jewish heritage. In some places, Zackheim's  writing mirrored Leduc's. There's so little written about Leduc, which is  such a tragedy.	2000-03-30

Since the death of her lover, Frank has lived her life  on long hours at work and endless alcohol, but this begins crumbling. The  pacing of the story is superb, but what saves this simple mystery is the  characterizations. It's reminiscent of Emma Donoghue's &quot;Hood&quot;  where the main character must come to grips with the loss of a loved one to  move toward hope. And this is Baxter Clare's first book! I hope the next is  as compelling.	2000-03-30

I totally love the tidbits, as well as the interviews. Now, the biggest problem with this book is the excessive amount of  editorial errors. Just in my first reading of this book, I found over a  dozen! And this is published by a university press! If you can overcome the  distractions of these mistakes, then you can enjoy what this book is meant  to be: a fascinating collection of interviews of some of the biggest names  in gay men's publishing.	2000-03-30

Some of the stories from  this are excerpted in &quot;The Vintage Book of International Lesbian  Fiction&quot;, and they inspired me to order a copy of this. I wasn't  disappointed. Te Awekotuku's language is often strong and forceful, and her  depictions of the lives of women in New Zealand are intriguing. Most of the  stories center on the character of Tahuri, but not all.	2000-03-30

The story of a boy growing up with a shadow is not entirely new, and Bowes breathed new life in this by  adding the queer element and in his refreshing settings. I found it rather  confusing and couldn't always figure out when the events occurred: past,  present, recent..?	2000-03-30

The structure of each chapter embodying a  different incarnation of Eden's experiences in Paris is quite innovative  and enriching. Each step of the way improves her sense of language and  self, and Youngblood reflects this in the language of Eden as the narrator.  There are several passages where I felt more depth would have helped the  reader, but overall I didn't feel the novel lacked. Like Michele Zackheim's  &quot;Violette's Embrace&quot;, this is a wonderful novel about walking in  an author's shadow and discovering one's own creative self.	2000-03-30

Anouk &amp; Karen set out to rescue a young girl from an arranged marriage in Yemen, and fall in love in the process. The  details are quite evocative of the African and Arab locales, and they don't  overpower the story. What is so wonderful about this story is the  interracial main characters, and the placement of lesbians in the Arab and  Ethiopian worlds. A beautiful and thrilling adventure.	2000-03-23

From such big names as Violette Leduc, Emma Donoghue, Makeda Silvera, and Dionne Brand, to  new-to-American-eyes writers like Jeanne d'Arc Jutras, Yasmin Tambiah, and  Ngahuia Te Awekotuku, this anthology has definitely opened my eyes to the  diversity of lesbian fiction. I only wish there was more available by some  of these authors here in the US! This book only whets the appetite like  standing in the middle of an international food festival, not knowing which  morsel to savor first.	1999-11-05

I believe Wells was trying to convey how Simone felt disconnected to her family and to her own  passions through the language, but somehow it just didn't connect for me. I  think the story is marvelous and full of potential. I was reminded of  Violette Leduc's &quot;Therese and Isabelle&quot; somewhat. And I heartily  identified with the idea that through forgiveness for familial abandonment  one finds peace and passion. I hope Wells only improves from here.	1999-11-05

Whether your obsession is with a certain person, a specific type of people, or an action, you'll probably find something that comes close in this excellent collection.

With inspiration from Dame Agatha Christie, Craft has outdone himself in this third mystery in the Mark Manning series. I was slightly  disappointed with the previous book, &quot;Eye contact&quot;, so I was  hesitant to read the third. Am I glad I did! I cannot rave enough about  this book. I think it even surpasses &quot;Flight dreams&quot;.	1999-05-09

Kobayashi evokes in a sort of poetic fire clearly the sometimes joyful, sometimes painful ties people  have with each other. Even though the characters are women and most are  lesbians, the overall story can clearly portray parallels in any family  unit, whether chosen or hereditary. Resonates along with Sarah Schulman's  &quot;Rat Bohemia&quot; or Alison Bechdel's series &quot;Dykes to Watch out  for&quot;.	1999-05-07

I'm not really into Westerns, but by about halfway through the book, I was totally hooked! Brilliant use of the various metaphors of 'frontiers': physical, sexual, emotional. I especially loved how well he expressed the  concept of being gay in an overbearingly non-gay world. And it's a love  story to boot!	1999-05-07

Incredibly moving and powerful. This is what  you'd get if a horror movie didn't have specific monsters: a dark and  brooding tale of people in limbo waiting for their lives to change and  being unable to force them to change for the better. I'll be rereading this  next year so I can savor it all over again.	1999-05-07

I wish I lived in Western Canada so I could have a chance to see Taste This (the performance troup whose work is showcased in this book) in action! The four members give some great memoirs and assorted stories of  growing up different in terms of gender and sexuality. I wanted the book to  go on and on because every story makes you stop and rethink the terms of  gender forced upon us by society. And don't even get me started on the  pictures!!! :)	1999-05-07

As the two were trying to discover some common ground after all they'd gone through as kids  and so far as adults, I felt a resonance with my own life. There's no  guarantee they'll ever become close, but they just might try anyway. It  reminded me somewhat of the movie &quot;In the Gloaming&quot; where I  wanted to get back in contact with my family. Another reading of the twin  brothers is that it's two aspects of one mind trying to figure itself out.  It's like the gay side of the brain is conversing with the side that was  brought up to believe that being gay is wrong and the only life is through  strict religion. I'm sure there's more levels that that could take, too.	1999-05-07
