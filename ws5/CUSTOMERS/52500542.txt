You can sample the work of each foundry and get an idea of their product line.<br /><br />Best of all, the front of the book has in index in alphabetical order showing each font. So you can locate a font you like and then look it up for additional information.<br /><br />You can also find the AIGA's guide to the Use of Fonts, important for understanding copyright in using fonts in your work.<br /><br />The bonus CD has 33 fully-licensed fonts. Not all of them are unique--you can find some of these gratis on the web, but the collection is handy for those who can't get enough fonts.

(I have enough clutter, believe me.) So the editors of this excellent magazine have compiled all kinds of tricks and ideas into this single volume. It's a lot of fun to read and has some very helpful stuff for keeping your home in order.<br /><br />The chapters include:<br /><br />1. Grooming<br />2. Getting Dressed<br />3. In the Kitchen<br />4. In the Office<br />5. Cleaning<br />6. Decorating<br />7. Entertaining<br />8. Celebrating<br /><br />1. Grooming includes how to unclog your drain. I am going to go try this; my bathroom sink is not draining properly. Here, you dump a cup of baking soda down and add a gallon of boiling water..<br /><br />Naturally, the grooming section is homemade recipes for face scrub, toothpaste (?) and fun ideas like freezing aloe vera gel for sunburn relief--if you KNOW you are just going to go get burnt, you might as well prepare.<br /><br />2. Getting Dressed has hints on mending, washing dainty things,<br /><br />3. In the Kitchen--not the best part of the book, I thought, some basic recipes and how to use a wine bottle as an emergency rolling pin.<br /><br />4. In the Office; someone peeked in my desk drawer at work, because there is a suggestion for supplies like toothbrush and toothpast and a lint roller, plus some basic makeup. I have this. They didn't find the hair dryer and shampoo I keep in the office bathroom in case I get drenched or sweated out and have to do my hair over at work..hahah. Another suggestion, spare house keys! Good idea.<br /><br />5. The cleaning section has a stain removal guide, probably worth the book for this alone.<br /><br />6. Decorating, lots of tips, but most useful, how to paint a room.<br /><br />7. The entertainment section has fun things like freezing berries to make colorful ice cubes for summer drinks, and how to buy for a cocktail party.<br /><br />The book ends with all the marvelous things you can do with dental floss, aside from flossing between your teeth.<br /><br />Good for the newly-wed or just-got-first apartment couple. This is a pretty volume that would make a welcome gift for just about anyone.a pretty volume that would make a welcome gift for just about anyone.	2005-09-22

If you are looking for a housewarming present or a bridal gift, this is something you really should consider.<br /><br />\\"In Style Parties\\" contains basic instructions for hosting anything from a baby shower to a cocktail party, Thankgiving Day feast or a Mediterranean-inspired evening. The chapters give day-by-day schedules (what to do three weeks, two weeks, day of, etc), full menus, shopping lists, what dishes you need. Simpler versions of each party are given to make it easy if you are short on time, funds or ambition.<br /><br />One chapter includes how to stock a basic liquor shelf and how to make some popular cocktails like cosmopolitans, margaritas and martinis (hint, pour the vermouth over the ice in the shaker, then pour it out; the perfect dry martini.)<br /><br />The food looked simple yet elegant and the photography makes you want to dive in and write those invitations. If you are uncomfortable entertaining and want to get started, this is for you. Highly recommended	2005-09-20

There are eight chapters:<br />1. Easy Does it<br />2. Simple Scarves with a twist (fringe, pockets, embellishments)<br />3. Cables<br />4. Granny Squares<br />5. Shaped Scarves (narrow-wide-narrow shaping, for example)<br />6. Lace basics<br />7. Fabulous Scarves (bobbles, crochet applique)<br /><br />There are hints on finishing, using eyelash novelty yarns. The photos are pretty, the drawn illustrations lavish. If you are an experienced knitter, you may be somewhat beyond what's here, so I recommend this for beginner-intermediate skill knitters.<br /><br />\\"Just Hats\\", the companion volume has simple hats to more complex.<br /><br />1. Easiest Hats ever(crochet, knit)<br />2. Seamless hats (like watchcap and very pretty but simple berets)<br />3. Simple hats with a twist (Jester Hat and a VERY fun raccoon hat from fun fur)<br />4. Granny square hats (for the crocheters)<br />5. Children's hats<br />6. Hats that incorporate color (including a NON-granny square crochet hat in two colors, and a snowflake hat.)<br />7. Felted hats<br />8. Great Patterns, including a Paul Bunyan crocheted hunters hat with flaps and a two-eared snowboarder's style tassled hat.<br /><br />Of the two books, I preferred the hat book, BUT if you long to knit those furry long boas or make mini shawls and neckwear, the scarf book is good. Both books recommended for the newer knitter. Lion Brand Yarns sponsored these books, so the yarns are widely available at craft and discount department stores.	2005-09-14

One quart of O-positive, please	Author Hayes mixes science, philosophy and a lot of personal intimacy in this interesting book on blood. A strange subject (though not the strangest around--a recent bestseller is about cadavers.) We have five quarts of the red stuff--hence the title.<br /><br />The book starts with Bill getting a cut. But then we go on a journey about hemophila and history (the royal house of Great Britain) and we learn about bloodletting, blood banks, and ultimately the AIDS epidemic.<br /><br />While I would prefer more science and less personal information in a treatise on a scientific subject, that's just me (I studied biology and immunology for quite some years.) But for a non-science-steeped reader, this is a fascinating look at the stuff of life. Recommended, though not for the squeamish.	2005-09-13

There are two stories about Theresa and John Paul Wiggin--how they met and how John Paul grew up in Poland. These will be meaningful especially to readers of the parallel sequel to \\"Ender's Game\\", the Shadow series.<br /><br />Also included is the ORIGINAL \\"Ender's Game.\\" This is really fascinating. I have to say, the writing is very inferior to the revised and novelized version of this original short story. But for those who love the book, you have a glimpse into writer's craft. How did Card deepen each character? How did he revise his conversation and exposition? Good lessons here for any budding writer, and great for those who love the Ender's series as you can see the development of the books from an average short story to a thrilling series of books.<br /><br />The short stories end with a small tale about a tax collector dealing with Ender as he roams from planet to planet after he leaves Earth. This is meaningful for the last in the Ender's series (Shadow of the Giant.) And it's a good story in itself.<br /><br />Recommende for fans of the Card series.	2005-09-11

However, this reasonably priced volume has the \\"how\\" of oddball knitting, including calculating how much yarn you have, weights, lengths to finish a row, how to combine colors and most importantly, how to safely store your stash of yarn. The patterns include a stunning shawl, scarves, hats, purses, socks and an Amish-inspired afghan.<br /><br />There are 31 patterns in all, but the main use of this book is to know HOW to combine yarns to make something out of nearly nothing. If you are bothered by those golf-ball sized bits of sock yarn after making a pair of socks, or want to use a single ball of novelty yarn that was so tempting you bought just ONE, this is for you. But this book demands you use YOUR creativity, so don't look for designs here, just seeds for design ideas.	2005-09-08

This book is well-illustrated	With plenty of large, good photos and drawings, Maran's Illustrated Knitting and Crocheting is a great choice for the beginner. Chapters include:<br /><br />1. Getting started<br /><br />2. Basics (casting on, stitches and some simple projects like a scarf, a bathmat and a dishcloth<br /><br />3. Increasing and decreasing (shaping) and projects for a hat, tank top, a baby outfit. Short rows (a way to make a bulge) is included.<br /><br />4. Decorative touches like fringe, beads, bobbles and tassles.<br /><br />5. Mistakes! Fixing dropped stitches and how to rip out.<br /><br />6. Knitting in the round (make a tube with no seams) pattern for a sock<br /><br />7. Color Knitting, projects include child's sweater and a blanket<br /><br />8. Finishing (so important!) buttonholes, seams, grafting. Project: a pullover and a purse.<br /><br />9. Crochet basics, how to read a crochet pattern<br /><br />10. Stitches, pattern for two scarves<br /><br />11. Glossary and abbreviations.<br /><br />As you can see, there is not much of crochet here--more for a knitter who might want to incorporate it than for a dedicated I-wanna-be-a-crocheter. Still, a lot for the money here, well-illustrated and affordably priced, too. A sure-fire gift for the wanna-be beginner. A good reference for the starting knitter who missed the details of knitting mentioned above.	2005-09-07

In \\"God without Religion\\", author Saranam tells us that the cerebrum and the spinal column act as a kind of antenna to receive the messages and awareness of God. Any type of labelling (\\"I am a Muslim, A Christian, a Jew) would serve to limit the self and thus limit the ability to receive the Infinite that is the awareness and knowledge of the Supreme Being. Therefore, councils Saranam, it is wise to meditate yogi-style, and learn to become one with God, no matter what image of him  you have in your heart.<br /><br />This is a fascinating look at the philosophy of religion with a very good step-through of history, but definitely from the viewpoint of someone who is steeped in yoga (not the exercise, the meditation part.) There is plenty of advice to mind your actions as they affect others, to be \\"in the moment\\" or being mindful of your actions as you perform them. If you have trouble with the major beliefs, but you feel there is something more than the self, you might get benefit from this book. Even if you are firm in your belief, this is an extraordinary book and written with great skill, sincerity and thoughtfulness.	2005-09-05

This is a great how-to	Susan Harrow writes a complete how-to for any woman (or man) to set up and run their own PR campaign. The chapters include:<br /><br />1. Achieve your Goals and Dreams with Publicity<br /><br />2. Begin a Publicity Campaign<br /><br />3. Write Your Press Materials<br /><br />4. Create a Campaign that Suits your Style<br /><br />5. Prepare Yourself Verbally and Psychologically for Media Attention<br /><br />6. Create a Clear Message<br /><br />7. Keep and Sustain Media Interest<br /><br />8. Integrate Publicity into Your Life<br /><br />As you can see from the chapter titles, this is a very complete map for anyone embarking on a publicity campaign. Tidbits abound: my favorite--how to interrupt the interrupting interviewer (priceless.) Also related, how to deal with a raging bully. (use strong \\"you\\" statements like \\"You need to understand that...\\")<br /><br />I can't think of any book I've seen that is more complete and easy to read for someone entering public life. While this is pitched to women, men could benefit equally. A real winner.	2005-09-05

Bean, now a giant, suffering from the effects of a gene in his makeup that had been developed by an evil genius, is striving to end his time on Earth and leave the planet in a better way than when he was born.<br /><br />This book in the series is far better than the middle \\"Shadow\\" books, though not quite as excellent as \\"Ender's Shadow\\", where we really get to know Bean. Sometimes, Card seems to be force-marching his characters along, but the story is crisp and thrilling, nonetheless. There is one strange thread, the character Randi, who seems to be involved with the evil Achilles, but she appears in one scene and drops out. Is this a hook to continue the series further? Probably. No matter what, Card has ended (?) the Shadow series brilliantly.	2005-09-04

Some of this is intellectual; creativity as your spiritual birthright, how to tap the Muses by understanding how the personification of the arts is meaningful. Other advice is the type that writers need--how to write a memoir, getting unstuck, focus and self-awareness.<br /><br />I found this book more aimed to the writer than the visual artist; still, there is a lot of wealth and wisdom here. If you are in any of the creative arts or in business, where creativity is a useful skill in problem-solving, then you ought to have a copy of \\"Inspiring Creativity\\" on your shelf. It just may get you unstuck someday. Think of it as an emergency \\"jaws of life\\" for those days when the juices just don't flow.	2005-08-22

Though somewhat dated in feel and redolent of the Seventies, &#34;Book of Skulls&#34; is an excellent novel by Silverberg. Three college boys, who have been deep in the stacks of the rare books at the university, set out to find a mysterious sect of monks who may have the secret of eternal life. They are dimly aware that three of them go in, but only one will remain.<br /><br />They find the brothers and take up the discipline of the order. This is the Seventies, so sex is involved. Maybe even drugs. The brothers do tantric yoga and other yoga. They eat a vegetarian diet of eggs, hot red pepper pastes, vegetables and dark bread that has been &#34;cleansed&#34; to become suitable food.  They bathe in deep slate pools in the monastery and adopt the ways of the order.<br /><br />Once you join, you belong to the brothers and cannot leave without deadly consequence. Which one will die of murder and which one by his own hand? It's very logical, but you won't guess it until near the end. There are plenty of nasty shocks and revelations about growing up and the traumas and unsavory incidents that make up coming of age.<br /><br />Not my favorite Silverberg novel, but high on my list.	2005-08-21

They are \\"kid tested\\" meaning if your offspring are tending to dine on chicken fingers and hamburgers as the exclusive source of their nourishment, they probably will spoon up some of these dishes, too.<br /><br />Recipes include Noodle Bake, Strogonoff Supper, Pizza Pockets and Mexican Casserole This last I had to check out because at work, we have a war-word for bad food at the headquarters and it's (whisper it) Mexican Lasagna. This atrocity was perpetrated on us last April and consists of tortillas and taco meat posing as lasagna, Wrong, wrong wrong. Mexi-Casserole here, however, is elbow mac and taco-seasoned hamburger. In other words, Chili Mac. You are safe serving this to anyone, probably, except gourmands and vegetarians. Desserts are cinnamon baked apples, banana cream pie, no bake peanut butter choco squares and the alluringly if bad-for-you-sounding Snickers Salad<br /><br />The organization of ths book leaves a lot to be desired, but if you know a young mom who is overwhelmed by the kitchen or someone who inherited the job of cooking for a herd, this is a great book gift.	2005-08-21

I myself had prepared an indigo bath once, and enjoyed watching the slightly yellow bath turn greenish yarn startlingly blue-jeans blue when shaken in air (Utterly fascinating. If you teach school chemistry or home school, this manual could be a semester of science work.)<br /><br />Everything is included here, from equipment to recipes to weights and measures. In addition are suggestions on how to keep records (important if you want to reproduce anything again, and a full color section of yarn swatches.)<br /><br />Dyeing is fun, whether you use Kool-Aid food dye or prepare natural materials like barks, roots or berries. But there are safety measures to heed, so I recommend this book as an essential if you want to undertake this art in your fiber work.	2005-08-21

Are you going through life, just going through the motions, or are you living with meaning? There are exercises in \\"The Meaning of Life Project\\" that give you a way to think about what you are doing on this planet. For example, you write an essay after answering the questions \\"Am I here by accident or God's choice?\\" There are no wrong answers, but after you choose the answer above, you write a list of things that inspire you, an inventory of your skills, what results you want to have happen, and what the initial choice above MEANS to you. Either way, you'll choose a purpose and start to make it happen.<br /><br />For young people, with a faltering sense of direction, or for someone going through a crisis of self-doubt or needing redirection in life, this is a handy manual and could prove a very important tool to craft a new path in life.	2005-08-21

The photography is large, bright and exceptionally good. I was particularly taken with the work of Ginny Ruffner, who incorporates a kind of surrealism in her glass reminiscent of Dali.

If you love glass and sculpture, you will adore this volume.	2005-07-17

There are examples in this book of people gone wrong, terribly wrong, for very little reason other than the environment they were working in gave all the wrong signals--and that any moral training they'd had was weak enough to be lost in the crowd of \\"everyone's doing it, so it's ok.\\" So, is it really ok to cheat stealing supplies, award bids to cronies and  work against the firm's benefit for your personal gain because someone else is doing it? What's your answer? Without a moral compass (the instruction set on what and what not to do and why) and without moral direction (the how and when and why of what to do and what not to do) some pretty sad things happen.<br /><br />This is the crux of \\"Moral Intelligence\\" --businesses have to model the behavior as well as to instruct their members in ethics. And people better have a good grounding long before they enter the business world--after all, our values are pretty much set at age 10.<br /><br />The proposition in \\"Moral Intelligence\\" is that long-term business goals will benefit from doing the right thing, and that the needs of the moment and the shortcuts in doing things in a less than moral way are going to end up in a tragedy. I'd say, anything you read on the headlines today indicates that moral shortcutting pragmatism loses to the high road, eventually. Your sins catch up with you. Why not run your business, large or small, based on good values and ethics? You'll be a pillar of the community, you'll probably avoid being prosecuted, and you'll surely sleep better at night. An absolute MUST-READ for anyone in the business world and imperative if you are in a leadership role. Recommended.	2005-07-07

Jorge, the main character, loses his young wife and is understandably unable to handle the grief. But to make matters worse, a new technique called \\"rekindling\\" allows the dead to have a sort of life after death. But they don't resume their old ways. Instead the Dead are a new culture with new ways. Jorge is a \\"warm\\" and thus shut out of this society. His lack of acceptance of change and the ultimate tragedy is a fable for all of us.<br /><br />\\"Thomas the Proclaimer\\" is the weakest novella in the set, but still worthy to be read. A prophet demands, and gets, a sign from God. But sometimes proof destroys belief.<br /><br />\\"Going\\" is a fine novella dealing with the acceptance of life's end and the culmination of one's work and meaning as a living member of the world. In a society where life can be prolonged indefinitely, when is enough enough?

This former Soviet republic holds an important place in history--crossroads of the Silk Road in Central Asia, it is a mixing pot of the Far East and the easternmost reaches of Europe. The people are Asiatic and Turkic, far different than the Russians who moved in during the Soviet era. The time covered in this memoir is the early 90's, when Kazakhstan made the painful transition from Soviet republic to a nation on its own (though associated in the Russian circle.) The turmoil of ethnic conflict, monetary upheavals are well documented here.<br /><br />But what I really appreciated was the more personal observation about daily life. Rosten travels around Kazakhstan and reports the customs of the people in personal detail--this is the best part of the book. How much vodka to order for a party (surprise; 1 bottle per every 2 adults. Women will drink champagne...maybe.) He tries to avoid getting into drinking matches, sipping the edge of his glass and we imagine him watering the potted plants secretly now and then. The cold weather, the markets, the local cuisine (horse is on the menu) and the juxtaposition of statues of Lenin surrounded by ceremonial yurts. It's a wonderful journey and Rosten tells it simply and well. This is not only a book about recent historical events, it's a personal book--his time as a guest in a foreign land. I loved it and if you are an armchair traveler, you will want to pick this up and read it.	2005-05-19
243934:US	52500542	REK2NAUO6E92X	1410798216	92617604	1: Merry on Little Things	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A memoir of great promise	Amit Banerjea will get your attention at the opening of \\"Merry on Little Things.\\" His father has moved the family to Calcutta and Banerjea describes their new home in the eyes of a little boy. Here's how the houses look, with their rail-less verandas and enclosed courtyards. Here's how the family survived, poor, in a city where poverty has levels that know almost no bounds. Amit is told by his mother and father: do not stray outside the building and when he does inevitably disobey, we see the dangers and confusion of life in this city, feeling almost as scared and confused as the little lost boy must have felt.<br /><br />This memoir is far from perfect--the usual speedbumps of too many foreign words make the language a bit halting for those of us not familiar with terms like puja and lahk. However, if you overlook this minor flaw, you will see a writer of GREAT promise who has the ability to delve into memory and senses and produce a work that is bound to touch you. Banerjea's writing reminds me strongly of Ved Mehta--the blind Indian author who wrote a trilogy of biographies (Vedi, Daddyji, Mammaji) that were excerpted in the New Yorker in the 80's. Mehta could take you into his world of sounds, smells, texture and flavor, and Banerjea does that with a masterful hand. In addition, as the author leaves India for England and the US, his writing changes along with the adoption of new English words and slang--his growing sophistication and knowledge is incredibly well reflected in his writing.<br /><br />But the most touching part of Banerjea's memoir is his depiction of the life of widows and women in Indian society. The socialized degradation of widows is explained and more significantly, we cry along with him for the bad things that happen to the women in his life.<br /><br />This is not a perfect book, but it's a sensitively written and heartfelt memoir that had me reading it non-stop from cover to cover. I then immediately rang up the author on the phone. Well done. Write more, please, Mr. Banerjea.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ell done.

Her shop, selling secondhand bridal dresses employed three tailors and she felt that she was on a path to financial security. She took a winter holiday with her boyfriend Marco to Kenya to enjoy the beaches and a short safari. While taking the ferry from Mombasa to her beach hotel, she sees a Masai warrior, tall, dark, with a face so stunningly beautiful that it could be a woman's; but no woman had a face with such strong muscles and defined bones. Corinne is smitten, almost bewitched by the vision of this Masai.<br /><br />The rest of the trip is a disaster; she meets Lketinga, who speaks broken English. Her boyfriend Marco is understandably put out by her obsession with the Masai. Then, Lketinga flouts a local law forbidding locals from being on a beach and is thrown in jail. Corinne breaks up with her boyfriend and spends some frantic days traveling around Mombasa to find where Lketinga is being held.<br /><br />Back in Switzerland, the vision of living in Kenya overwhelms Corinne, and she sells her shop, her car and heads back to be with Lketinga. The primitive lifestyle is a far cry from clean and safe and orderly Switzerland (was this the secret attraction for Corinne?) Though she lives in mud hut and though she must share her man with other wives eventually, these are not the things that result in conflict. It is the everyday jealousies and hurts, same as one would find in Zurich or Bern that drive Lketinga and Corinne apart. Corinne has a daughter by Lketinga and opens a small grocery. This impugns, somehow, her husband's manhood, though he likes the affluence it affords. He becomes as jealous as Othello and finally, he shaves his locks, sheds his red Masai robe and puts on loud jeans, shoes and a shirt. The warrior is gone--what's left is a jealous, unreasonable husband who can barely communicate with his wife.<br /><br />Corinne takes her daughter and goes back to Switzerland. She once again starts a successful business and her life in a Kenyan Masai village is a closed chapter until she writes this excellent memoir.<br /><br />Sadly, so far this book is available in German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish and Spanish but not English (I am reviewing the German edition.) However, Corinne writes simply and effectively in German and despite what I assume were a few \\"Swiss-isms\\" I was unfamiliar with, anyone who can read college German will find this accessible.

After reading these essays, my mind was teeming with new ideas and I began to see entirely new threads in all Mann's books. For example, the use of teeth as a symbol in \\"Buddenbrooks.\\"  An essay discusses the weak teeth of Thomas Buddenbrooks (which cause his death) and his son Hanno, a symbol of decline and decay, literally. And carrying that thread forward, one notices the description of abundantly, almost unnaturally healthy teeth (Gerda Buddenbrooks and the dubious Aline Puvogel, the courtesan who marries Christian, Tom's brother, who have teeth that are described as incredibly white and strong.) Detlef Spinel (\\"Tristan\\") has teeth that are large and decayed--the outward manifestation of some inward decay, perhaps what has drawn to stay at an elegant sanatorium.<br /><br />Though the essays deal mainly with \\"Magic Mountain\\" I found them insightful as well for \\"Dr. Faustus.\\" In short, if you love the fiction of Thomas Mann, reading these essays is time well and pleasurably spent.	2005-03-06

He was a colorful figure who seemed to be as much at odds with the university as the contentious students during the turbulent late 70's. Later, he went on to head the New York Public Library and then Brown University. He seemed to have a magical way to become influential and well-liked. After reading this book, I liked him a lot and wished I'd had a chance to know him while I was at Penn. Gregorian is a man of letters and great charisma.<br /><br />Gregorian's story of his life is as charming as his public persona. From the opening lines about his life in Tabriz, Iran as a member of the Armenian minority community there, to his wise grandmother who raised him, his life is exciting and fraught with tragedy and pitfalls. His mother dies in childbirth and his father essentially abandons the family. Somehow, Vartan manages to find an education despite great difficulties and he is sponsored finally to go to the Armenian University in Beirut. From there, his career as a professor and man of letters takes off and he soars, always helped by friends of influence who provide that wind under his wings. And he's grateful. He moves some thirty times (not thirty jobs, as he points out) and goes from Stanford to Texas to Penn, to New York and places in between. All along he meets luminaries like Jackie Kennedy Onassis, the Queen of England, makes friends with former BU president John Silber and yet seems to stay folksy and unaffected by all the glitter.<br /><br />The book is highly readable and a fine memoir--whether you've heard of Gregorian or not, this is a wonderful tale about a man who overcame ridiculously bad odds to become one of America's most influential public figures in education. I thoroughly enjoyed it.	2005-02-25

This is supposed to improve digestion and detoxify the body.<br /><br />The Ghermanda Samita, as translated by James Mallinson, is a valuable reference for serious students of yoga. There are the seven chapters, corresponding to the seven ways to perfect onself, from physical practices and health to meditation and enlightenment (samahdi) at the end.<br /><br />In addition to photos of the asanas next to the text that discusses them, the  chapter on Dhyanas (meditations) has some visually stunning paragraphs. These could be of help to someone who is meditating and needs a kernel of something to focus on, or even an artist who wants to tap a side of the unconscious with visual meditations.<br /><br />There is also a chapter on yogi breathing, and from what I am told, one can never have enough information on this important aspect of practicing yoga.<br /><br />This is a relatively late work of Hatha Yoga (from the 1800's?) and is translated as directly from the Sanskrit as the author was able, while retaining the meaning and beauty of the passages.  If you are a student of yoga, this is a valuable source book and quite interesting reading, as well.	2005-01-20

Mr. Crawshaw has the ability to take complex subjects and simplify them. In the case of boats and harbors, he shows how to do barges, boats, harbor details and water. Both watercolor and acrylic techniques are covered, though not in detail. As ever, Mr. Crawshaw is not a colorist--he is, rather, better at value and shape and perspective, as well as composition. If you want to learn what to see--what to draw, when you are painting a marine scene, this is a somewhat useful reference, but it's not one of Crawshaw's best books. As his career as a teacher and author progressed, his books improved greatly.  This one is probably best if you are already a Crawshaw fan.	2005-01-09

He's known as an equestrian painter, so it's a bit disappointing that there isn't more in this book about painting horses (perhaps he's leaving that for a separate volume.) I also find Crawshaw's palette a bit dull--he goes for the natural look of muted greens and browns and blues--very realistic but not as exciting as the bright tropical colors that are now more in vogue in painting. This is in the true English tradition of watercolor. Nevertheless, I find that I've learned more by doing Crawshaw's exercises for painting things like trees and sheep than from many other books or videos. To rate this book; visually--it's not so exciting. Technique-wise, if you try out some of these techniques, your brushwork for certain details and compositions will become simpler and less worked-over. Recommended for that reason.	2005-01-09

His technique is loose yet structured; he does portraits, landscapes, florals all with exceptional dash yet clearly he is following rules of some kind. What are they? He reveals his ideas on composition, color and things specific to watercolor. His use of the white of the paper is extraordinary; he doesn't just restrict this to highlights, but leaves large patches of paper that lets the eye fill in the subject in a very exciting manner.<br /><br />The book is in a longer-than-wide format and beautifully printed. The example paintings are lovely--you just want to stare at them and wonder how he could make something so uncontrived-looking. But the technique is not simple, so if you admire this style of watercolor and strive for looseness yet coherence in your own painting, I'd recoomend this book for your library. It gives you a lot to think about and try for yourself.	2005-01-09

The book does not just deal with juxtapositions of color or of mixing pigments; the author goes into the compositional effects of color choices, with examples of changes if you use value (dark to light, color becomes diminished) or if you use all pastels or colors close in range on the color wheel. In addition, there is a section on how the masters employed color in famous paintings, and a section of example works by other artists. This is valuable--the inclusion of other artists makes the book appealing to a variety of painters; not everyone responds to individual artists, so the wise author of painting books is one who generously shares the canvas with his colleagues. You are guaranteed to find some inspiration in the gallery. This is a nice large format book that shows off the colors on the pages well. Excellent.	2005-01-09

And one thing she did not want to do was write a \\"tell all\\" autobiography and be a \\"veuve abusive\\" or a toxic widow, one who tells all and sullies the reputation of a late husband. But she is so reticent, that it takes the urging of her family to finally put on paper some of the interesting events in her long marriage to the Nobel Prize-winning author.<br /><br />Katia Pringsheim was a highly intelligent child, daughter to a university professor in Munich. She was so bright that her parents arranged for her to be privately tutored for high school--sadly, before World War I, girls were not admitted to German \\"gymnasium\\" or high school college preparatory schools. She enjoyed the tutoring of some rather famous instructors (Roentgen, the physicist, for one.) She qualified for the Abitur or university entrance. But as life would have it for many women, she married, and children and care for a husband became her occupation. She doesn't regret this entirely--she took on the role of manager of the quickly-growing Mann family, and her quick intelligence and practical side helped to get the Manns through some dangerous times, first World War I, then even more dangerous, World War II. All through the turmoil of moving from Germany to Switzerland, to the US, back to Switzerland, Frau Doktor Mann kept a watchful eye over the publishers, and ran the business side of the author's work.<br /><br />She tells less than one would like about her feelings during many traumatic or exciting events, but there are interesting if somewhat sketchy details on the models for famous characters in Mann's novels. For example, a very good friend, Gerhart Hauptmann, had a way of speaking in broken, incomplete sentences and thoughts. He became Pieter Pieperkorn, the kingly but incoherent Dionysian figure in \\"Magic Mountain.\\" While Frau Mann claims not every famous character had a real-life counterpart, she is able to source many of the characters Mann created, showing what physical or idiosyncratic portions he borrowed to put in his novels. This makes the memoir fascinating reading, as does a small but biting portrait of Alma Mahler and other luminaries of the early 20th Century such as Schoenberg, Brecht, Einstein, and Chaplin. For these sketches alone, this is must-reading for anyone interested in Thomas Mann.ces and thoughts.

Yet you only use one color at a time--no color changing per row.<br /><br />As you knit the alternating rows of dark and light yarns, you produce a pattern that is almost an optical illusion--depending on the angle you look at the knit piece, it may appear strongly patterned--or absolutely single toned. The yarns used are shetland-weight in wonderful colors. You can find these  yarns in the US, as Mrs. Hoxbro has contracted with an American manufacturer to make them for her. Sources of these yarns, and substitutes to be found in Europe are included in the back of the book.<br /><br />The rules of Shadow Knitting are:<br /><br />1. You always use at least 2 colors of yarn.<br /><br />2. Only one color is used at a time<br /><br />3. You alternate two rows of dark knitting with 2 rows of light knitting.<br /><br />4. You use knit and purl stitches only<br /><br />5. Wrong side rows use the same color as the previous row. The stitches are knitted or purled as per a chart.<br /><br />There are a lot of good illustrations and of course projects including shawls, pullovers, Hoxbro's favorite dolman sleeve tops, jackets, vest, kids' wear, bags and decor items like pillows.<br /><br />\\"Domino Knitting\\" was Hoxbro's previous book about a modular knitting technique. When \\"Dominos\\" was translated from Danish to English, the publisher put it into a small format. This time, \\"Shadow Knitting\\" is published in a bigger sized book--meaning the pictures and diagrams are large and easier to read. This is IMPORTANT--the diagrams of where to change from knit to purl are vital to the design and you want to see this clearly in the chart. But as before, you can enjoy Mrs. Hoxbro's fabulous sense of color. You should swatch some of the designs as they live and breath as no picture can portray in a book.<br /><br />Still puzzled by \\"Shadow Knitting\\" after trying it out? Ms. Hoxbro does give workshops in the US from time to time--her website is viv.dk which will give you access to a newsletter of her schedule and bright examples of her knitting designs from the books.br />Still puzzled by \\"Shadow Knitting\\" after trying it out?

Thanks to a recommendation from another watercolorist, I got a copy of this out-of-print classic. Eliot O'Hara was a fine watercolorist and author Schmalz outlines O'Hara's technique and lessons in clear, concise words and pictures.<br /><br />The book has color plates in the center, so most of the pictures are in black and white; while you can view the values of the colors (how dark, how light) you cannot get the full effect; however, that does not diminish the usefulness of the illustrations. For example, the explanation of how light reflects on wavelets is detailed but exquisitely clear. If you want to paint boat scenes or landscapes, this is probably one of the best sections on water and reflections I've read. There are a lot of pages devoted to establishing depth (with fog, color) and most of the pictures are of landscapes. The style is very much \\"Sixties\\"--in a way, the book looks very dated. But it doesn't matter because you'll be painting in your own style anyway, and the lessons are universally applicable to any landscape work. It's a shame this book is out of print, but secondhand copies are available. I recommend this for anyone serious about learning watercolor.	2004-12-02

Peter Drucker is, to me, the American Business Philosopher--a guru and teacher who writes about the business of business in a fundamental and memorable way. I've been reading his writings for years and I have to say they have shaped my own ideas on business in a profound way.<br /><br />This hardbound book looks rather like a smallish Bible and even has a ribbon to mark your page. It's a book that can fit on anyone's desk (or nightstand) for a quick refreshing read. Best of all, the content is not just random quotes and rehashing of previously published articles. Drucker adds an Action Point to the bottom of each day's reading and italicized points of importance.<br /><br />Here's an example from September 12-- Managing Oneself: Identify Strengths. Drucker advises you to use feedback analysis to really understand your strengths and bolster your weak areas. You write down key decisions and key actions. Nine months later, review the results. After a couple of years of this discipline, you will have a deeper understanding of yourself and how you behave. If you decisions that led to less than optimal results, instead of rationalizing or blaming others, you can adjust your own behavior to improve your outcome. And if you have a particular area in which you shine, you will know it and can take full advantage of your new-found strength. Just reading this makes you wonder; where will you be in three years and how will you have grown if you take up his suggestion of feedback analysis?<br /><br />This type of exercise, and much more in Drucker's book make this a useful book for students of nearly any discipline, for business associates, friends, you name it. Frankly, I like this book as much for its utility as a terrific gift as much I like it sitting on my own desk. I can't imagine who wouldn't benefit from reading it. And it only confirmed my enthusiasm for Dr. Drucker's writing. My recommendation; buy a copy for yourself and a bunch for your friends. It's great.ucker's writing.

These short stories, however, are as sharp and quick as a paring knife. Some of the stories are sketches for the monumental novels to come, such as \\"Tristan\\"--a satirical look at inmates in a sanatorium. Others are sweetly sick, for example \\"Blood of the Walsungs\\", which has something of the style of \\"Death in Venice.\\" Some say the children in \\"Walsungs\\" are modeled after Mann's own. I don't know if this is true, but it's a shocking idea.<br /><br />The stories vary from whimsical to fantastic, to tragic or even tragi-comedy. They are some of Mann's best work outside his novels, and though some are early works, they are interesting in showing the seeds of theme and promise in Mann's later great works. I consider this a \\"must-read\\" for anyone tackling Mann's bigger works.	2004-11-17

Many of these include the mysteries of Kundalini --the coiled center of energy close to the base of the spine. But there is a lot more here for the student of yoga, including photos of the various \\"asanas\\" or positions, health, diet and mental hygiene. If you read Sanskrit, this would be a treasure. If you don't, you still have a line-by-line translation of this ancient and honored work. It's like listening to the yogi himself as he lectures his disciples.

Now, reading it in published form, I think \\"Wisdom's Daughter\\" is even better than India Edghill's previous book \\"Queenmaker\\"--the story of Queen Michal, Saul's daughter and David's consort.<br /><br />In \\"Wisdom's Daughter\\", Edghill recreates the court of King Solomon and of Bilqis, Queen of Sheba. The author poses an answer to the riddle of the reason behind the Queen's long journey from far-off Sheba to Israel. What were the questions she wished to have answered that were so perplexing? It is rare that a queen would travel for months away from her realm and offer riches beyond imagination for information! Some have speculated that, in the Bible \\"all she desired\\"  was to have a child by Solomon. Edghill proposes a far more intricate answer.<br /><br />The writing is stylized though not overly florid, as befits the subject, and the imagery is rich and colorful. The stories of the other queens of Solomon are as interesting as Bilqis' own; a Sword Maiden from Troy, a sorceress who charms snakes to peer into the future, a breeder of tiny dogs, a Northerner whose blonde hair and pale skin is considered exotic and a princess of Cush (Nubia) who is \\"black but comely\\" as the Song of Songs states.<br /><br />Bilqis is joined by Baalit, the splendid daughter of Solomon. She is brilliant and wise enough to rule as a Queen, but in Israel, her brothers, who are by and large quite inferior to her, will succeed to the throne.  Characters from \\"Queenmaker\\" also make a reappearance, so this novel is in a sense a continuation of the first book. Howver, it stands entirely on its own as a novel.

I saw more than one room in my house! I use neutral paint in most rooms, a lot of black and white photos, stark lines in the furniture, well, you get the point. This was my cup of tea.<br /><br />But the ideas for refitting closets could be used by anyone, even if you are the Laura Ashley type rather than Bauhaus-is-our-house. I don't agree with glassed kitchen cabinets though I love the look (I am likely to cram in ten or so souvenir ceramic mugs from ferry boat trips and museums, none of which look delightully chic when showcased in glass and wood.) But for the most part, I enjoyed the ideas and picked up a few good tips for getting the closets to stop regurgitating at me when I open the door. And need I say, this is beautifully photographed? Summary: if you are a fan of \\"Real Simple\\" or even Martha Stewart Living, you will probably like this book a great deal.	2004-10-12

What are the focus of receptivity, the focus of dissatisfaction, and the focus of power? If you don't know, a set of nasty surprises awaits you as a sales person. As you seek entry into accounts to which you are expected to sell, you will find it's a cold, cold world out there, more than ever. Entering a new account and successfully turning it around can take forever--or a shorter time if you work smarter, not harder.<br /><br />Neil Rackham's book deals head-on with the issues of breaking into and selling to accounts that are \\"negative\\"--that is to say, buying from your competitor. But you can find the chinks to work your way in and find mutual benefits. Chances are, there is dissatisfaction in some area--with a competitor, with a technology, with a situation. The knowledgeable sales person can find the dissatisfied parties and influence them to take action. The result--sales for you and an improved situation for them.<br /><br />I found the book particularly good at identifying stages of the sale, in ways different from the traditional Xerox-style selling. For example, the stages are broken down into an implementation-resolution cycle, where, after needs are recognized, option are evaluated, concerns are met (objections, in old-speak) and finally a decision is made. You, as the salesperson, are shepherding the process with the decision makers and influencers through this cycle. So it pays to know where you are sitting in each stage of the cycle in order to present the right information to your client.<br /><br />This book is not hard to understand, and is well-organized. If ound it interesting and valuable reading, and think it belongs on any the major account manager's bookshelf.	2004-10-06

Quilting, you needn't be told, is enjoying a huge popularity with television shows, websites and shops for fabrics in almost every town. Even a friend of mine in a small village in the Black Forest of Germany quilts enthusiastically and wanted to visit American quilt shops on her first trip to the USA.<br /><br />If you are a quilt lover, you can profit by reading author Kiracofe's examination of quilts, from a study of fabrics and dyes, to the change in pattern popularity over time. For example, postage-stamp quilts, or quilts made of the tiniest squares, were in vogue as a sort of stunt or show of skill.<br /><br />African American quilts are an important part of quilt history and have unique and very characteristic design as well as marking the course of history from slavery to freedom. The Baltimore area, near where I live, is known for a style of applique quilt that bears the name of the city. I myself own a quilt from Kentucky that I now believe dates to the 1930's; I was able to research more about the type of print used in the fabric by reading this book.<br /><br />This book is beautifully photographed and rich in historical detail. If you know a quilter or if you are a quilt enthusiast yourself, this volume will not only delight but prove useful in research and education.	2004-10-06

A gorgeous book	This exciting book on lampwork beads is a must-own for anyone getting into glass beads. The first part of the book is a gallery featuring a number of artists. They give biographies--how they got into glass, their vision, and insight into their approach to this demanding art form. Their work, of course, is breathtaking; this is the best of the best. The photography is clear and brings each work to best advantage.<br /><br />Then the second half of the book shows HOW the beads are made, from simple techniques to some very advanced use of foils, enamel powders, shapes, molds, encasing and sculptural methods. I was surprised how some of the beads were created. My favorites were window-etched beads. Some of the flowers inside these tiny marvels don't seem possible to be made of glass-they look real. Incredible.<br /><br />Even if you don't make beads (I don't, at least as of yet) and if you collect them instead, this book is fascinating reading, giving insight and knowledge into this ancient and exquisite craft. Highly recommended for anyone interested in lampwork beads.	2004-10-05

It is like death, then rebirth. Kifle Bantayehu was born in the US of Ethiopian parents. He documents the story of his family in a cycle of poems that will resonate with most people. These are not \\"art\\" poems: this is a saga, a legend in the oral tradition, told as we all tell our children and grandchildren the stories of our family's history and struggles. I think many people will feel some kinship with Bantayehu's simple but effective verses.<br /><br />\\"I am reborn to tell this tale<br />Of a man, a family, a dream, from this bed of veil;\\"	2004-10-04

The books both have a layout of a palette for floral painters, then a series of lessons, flower by flower, indicating the geometric shape (spike, trumpet, bowl, cup) and how to best paint the blossom.<br /><br />This book has more details and additional flowers, plus berries like Pyracantha and Cotoneaster. There is an expanded section on painting foliage such as ferns, tulip leaves, and coleus. While both books are helpful, this one is superior in the depth of the covered subjects. But probably if you paint flowers in watercolor, you'll want both of them. This one is excellent.	2004-10-04

This is a slim, short volume, listing flowers page by page. Each flower is analyzed as to its shape (cup, bowl, ray, spike, or ball) and suggestions for approaching each flower are given.<br /><br />The palette selections are good--but I like to see palettes for individual paintings. While the author does mention in the text which colors were used, for me, a swatch panel on the side is a helpful tool when doing au plein work. Some less-commonly painted flowers are included; mullein (a spikey wildflower used in herbcraft,) potentilla, which is a flowering shrub with tiny yellow or white blossoms. Red-hot pokers, foxgloves and bottle-brushes are included--things you'd find out in a garden along with the more common pansies and petunias.<br /><br />For the price, this book is a very good buy--and a useful one, at that. If you are outdoors, it fits into your kit easily and provides on-the-spot advice.	2004-10-02

With a scrub board, soap and some fleece, you can create a finished project (garment, bag, vest, hat) in less time than it takes to spin and knit. Felt is an ancient art, predating woven fabrics, and still used today by many cultures for traditional garb; for example, the Siberian \\"valenki\\" are felt boots or liners that resist cold and snow better than leather. And many hats are traditionally made of felt on a block.<br /><br />Speaking of hats, this book has a cloche hat I really liked. My favorite project, however, was a pillow of small squares sewn together with the seams out, for texture. If you make small pieces of felt and don't know what to do with the swatches, here's a great project for you.. There are bags, cache-pots, teapot warmers, slippers and a lot more. Many of the projects look a bit modernistic (abstract fiber imbedded to make a design) but you can use the methods to create your own design and go from there. I did not like some of the projects colorways or ornamentation, but every one gave me the thought \\"if I did THIS instead...\\" which is great; you don't need to copy these projects to use them. (I will say, however, that I adored the pillow colorway--pale blues, creams and grays, enough to make one of my own.) I figure, if you take these methods and employ your own tastes and ideas, you are sure to find some excellent projects to make here. This would also be ideal for a girl or boy scout troop badge project, a 4-H project (especially for a young person who raises sheep) or for your child or students, as felt is fairly amenable to children's abilities and interests.	2004-09-30

The book has, as the title says, fifty types of flowers, organized alphabetically by Latin name, and a method to paint each. This method is more or less realistic, but not super-realism; the technique is loose enough. The back section contains recommendations for composition using crystal, vases, bouquets and other floral motifs.<br /><br />What I got out of the book were very helpful palette suggestions PLUS a discussion of the flower structure and how to paint it. What I did with it was to paint in MY style, which is more loose and expressionistic, and use these ideas for springboards for my own technique. I knocked off the study for the series of sunflowers-paintings-to-be and was VERY pleased with the result. This book helped me achieve my goal in the painting.<br /><br />Of course, I enjoy just reading the book for the pure pleasure of the author's beautiful technique. If you do floral watercolors, this is, in my opinion, a must-own volume. Highly recommended.	2004-09-29

If you are a novice to running a business, there are a lot of things you might not consider, for example licenses, local requirements and taxes, and legal issues. These subjects are mentioned but not gone into in detail. That's fine--the purpose of this book is to get you started in knowing what you DON'T know (which, yep, can hurt you.)<br /><br />The author touches on franchising, managing income property, buying an existing business. He gives some pro's and con's to each type of venture. This book is an excellent place to start if you are thinking of going it on your own in the future or..right away. Easy to read.	2004-09-27

I was originally late to the Potter Party but made up for lost time and started enjoying the books as they came out with this one.<br /><br />The story is one of my faves because of the World Quidditch Cup in the beginning (doesn't Rowling do a great job describing an imaginary sport?) And then the Tri-Wizards Cup. A new concept, new schools and of course, there is something dark behind the challenges and a mystery. The idea of a Yule Ball and dress robes (poor impecunious Ron and his shabby robes) was just great. And Hermione getting dressed up and having attention from the celebrity Krum was a nice touch.<br /><br />Great book. I've re-read it dozens of times and I think it's still one of my favorites of the series.	2004-09-26

This is a funky little book with everything from shabby-chic style projects to practical home care and clothing care advice. All with an eye to minimizing the budget and maximizing the effect.<br /><br />This would be great for a college-bound person who is going to live off-campus for the first time, or for a person who just got a new job and their first place on their own. It makes the idea of housework and crafts sound fun and creative, not scary or boring. And for those who crave a craft of their own, it has a Craft-Q Quiz to find what would suit a person best--gardening? knitting? Gourmet cooking? Woodworking?<br /><br />Of particular interest; how to shop at a thrift store--is that STAIN you see going to budge, and if so, how do you do that? Or is the item going to be tacky and a waste of money? I also liked the home recipes for mildew-removing solution and the recipes included last-minute meals that look stylish but take very little energy if you stock the right things in your cupboard. There are even recipes for homemade facial scrubs and the like.<br /><br />The book is very attractively-printed on excellent paper so that it is pleasant to hold and leaf through. I found it quite enjoyable to read and it had some very interesting recipes and ideas. I can't think of another book quite like it--great if you are youthful and bursting with energy--and want home ec to be hip ec. Go for it.	2004-09-24

There are manly cables, colorful tapestries, dainty laces. There is a fuzzy, elegant mohair wrap that is a scarf, yeah, it's just a scarf and Itzhak Perlman is just a fiddler.<br /><br />There are funky scarves with fringe in the middle instead of the ends (like a serape), there are chenille scarves, intricate intarsia dragons, plain garter, you name it. If you were a knitter who wanted to start with scarves and grow into knitting techniques, this book would take you from relatively simple knitting to magnificent advanced technique. All while making your Christmas presents for friends and family. My particular favorite was a weird but wonderful shrug; it's two arms and a turtleneck and NOTHING else--like a body-less sweater. I love it--if you want your shoulders and wrists warm, but are too hot in a conventional turtleneck, this may be for you. If you don't want to face questions about where the rest of the sweater went (moths?) then you can wrap the arms around your neck as if it were a standard scarf. Is that fun or what? I'm knitting one for me, for sure.<br /><br />I'm going on record saying I like the photography. This is a fun, fun book and really changed my mind about scarves. Not boring anymore, no way. Highly recommended for almost any knitter, but especially those who are familiar with colorwork, texture, intarsia and cabling. And there are a few crochet patterns as well. Highly recommended if you want to knit a scarf.	2004-09-24

However, after being tortured while overseas and losing the woman he loved, he retires to Florida and tries to pick up the pieces of his life, and more importantly, to heal himself.<br /><br />The novel has a lot of topical and \\"current events\\"--so much so that it seems like real life rather than fiction. Eddie struggles deeply with the large issues of life, things that we all are talking about right now in these uncertain times. I think many readers could take comfort and could identify with Eddie. I know I certainly did.	2004-09-24

This is all about capturing the inner vision and feeling and translating it into paint on paper. After I read this book, I thought about, well, nothing in particular, but I went and did a picture inspired by a market I visited in Bombay. I didn't use pencil to sketch, just put brush to paper and got several paintings that were the best I ever did. Something in this book made a secret part of my brush and paint handling \\"click\\" and even though I didn't like the author's painting style (!) I gained some kind of new ability from his text and examples of his sketches. If nothing else, this book will teach you to doodle profitably to advance your technique and artistic sense. Highly recommended.	2004-09-23

The combination of biographies of designers (some very ordinary people like factory workers) and ideas made this book a best-seller. It's been out of print for a while, but it still is a standard reference.<br /><br />Author Ericson illustrates her book with clear photographs. There is a biography of an elderly and elegant woman who has always worn--white and only white. Even at her husband's funeral. Ideas abound (some with patterns to sew from)--folkwear inspired, Asian-inspired, and funky stuff using office supplies or found objects. I wish I could show you the photos--they are amazing.<br /><br />If you sew, there are schematics here you can enlarge and use for sewing patterns. If you quilt clothing, there are plenty of unusual ideas. A wonderful book, fun to read and ponder.	2004-09-23

The premise, a resistance against an evil corporate-government entity is not unique, but this is a well-handled rendering of the subject. The novel is in some ways reminiscent of Marge Piercey's \\"He, She, and It\\" though without Piercey's richness in creating a future world.<br /><br />Ebriel, a French flutist, loses her family in a shocking event which is covered up. She goes on a heroic quest to bring the perpetrators to justice, and her personal experience of persecution and her resulting rebellion are really the core of the novel. As usual, Marley brings her own knowledge of music to provide detail and context to her work, a nice touch as always and gives a flavor to the writing that I enjoy. I just couldn't put it down.	2004-09-16

Crackle paint takes a chair from shabby to shabby-chic and a monogrammed natural linen or cotton tablecloth is transformed into a window blind.<br /><br />There are quite a few curtain header ideas here, from button tabs to using nautical hardware (grommets, yachting shackles) to make headers that are real stand-outs. And the cushion covers are simple to sew but creatively designed to get the most out of a simple idea such as a double flange with the color peeking out of the inside of the flange layers, or tie tabs instead of buttons or velcro.<br /><br />If you can do ordinary sewing and are only minorly handy, these patterns should be entirely do-able--and very effective all but the most formal decorating styles.	2004-09-15

There are many types of throat singing, and professional masters of the art are born into families of performers.<br /><br />The music sounds like horses galloping on the steppes and is rather reminiscent of our own cowboy folk ballads with a similar rhythm and pentatonic scale. My favorite song on the CD is the traditional Dyngylday, an amusing song about the merits of a boyfriend who doesn't have such a great horse. The other familiar cut on this CD is the traditional caravan song Baeshin, which has been recorded on other CD's and is filled with the trotting rhythm of the caravan horses as they speed along from Beijing to Tuva.	2004-09-14

Most kids' patterns use thinner gauge yarns for baby and toddler, so if you don't enjoy knitting with baby or fingering weight yarns, this book should light up your knitting life. And if you deplore the fact that fine gauge knitting takes time--while Junior is rapidly growing out of the knitting project on your needles, these projects are pretty fast. Most are done in plain stockinette or garter stitch, fast and easy, but effective in the decorative yarns used. The patterns are for infant to about three year old. No reason, however, you couldn't adapt these patterns for school age kids by adding on some rows and stitches to make them larger and longer.<br /><br />The patterns include basic pullovers and more elaborate ones, cardigans and variations, v-necks--cardis and pullovers, hats, ponchos, dressing blankets and snuggies. There is a section on fundamentals of knitting for the beginner and a glossary as well.<br /><br />Grammies and friends-of-babies take note: there is an adorable coat and hat set in chenille that works for boy or girl. A poncho in varigated yarn with a fun fur trim for a girl--in simple stockinette stitch. One cardigan is simplicity in itself, in plain knit in vivid purple--but a contrasting light color single crochet trim makes it look finished and very stylish. This is a very fun book of patterns for kids knits that will have you diving into your fancy bulky yarn stash with plenty of new ideas for children's knits.<br /><br />Joanna Daneman	2004-09-14

Griot is storytelling--these songs, with their conversational chant and chorus, are completely musical yet clearly are telling a saga or love story. Wish I could understand the language!<br /><br />Kasse is a member of the musical Diabate family of \\"jelis\\" or singers. He sings the traditional songs, accompanied by backup, guitar, and some other instruments. And speaking of other instruments, the track  \\"Funuke Saya\\" is a duo with Toumani Diabate, the great kora master of \\"New Ancient Strings\\"--the album that put Mali kora and world music on the charts. If you have \\"New Ancient Strings\\" you will immediately recognize Toumani's delicate music style and mastery. Worth the entire CD for this cut alone.	2004-09-14

Some of the patterns are straight-up sitting bears, but there is a sweet lying-down bear and a stretched-out long bear as well.

There is also a pattern for a recycled-yarn bear--you unpick sweaters you find at the Goodwill; as long as they are not felted or too holey, you can unpick them, blend the yarn and get a very pleasing looking toy. This means that for the price of the book and some good twenty-five cent yard sale hunting, you can make projects for nothing that look as if you spent plenty of dollars at a chic decorator's shop.<br /><br />My favorite pattern is the sleeping Sam bear, who makes you drowsy just to see his face, propped on an arm. The cover picture features a bear with wire glasses, cute to the extreme.<br /><br />I can envision a knitter becoming very besotted with these fun projects. Another idea, not in the book but possible with some of the information included, is to cut up a thrift sweater, felting it or not, and using the pattern shapes to sew a bear like a sock monkey rag doll. It's up to you and your creativity. This book is an excellent springboard for all kinds of stuffed bear fun. Recommended.	2004-09-12

I love Ann Budd's first book \\"The Handy Book of Knitting Patterns\\" which are small patterns such as gloves, hats, mittens, scarves and vests. Most people asked for a sweater book to follow, with basic patterns in all sizes, from kids to big adults. Here it is.<br /><br />You can take a raglan, a cardigan, a drop sleeve pullover or many other traditional styles like yoke-sweaters and knit either the basic pattern shown, or embellish it with your own texture, color or lace stitches. Ideas are given how to do the modifications.<br /><br />The book is spiral bound with hard board covers, and an elastic band to mark your place. This is the kind of book that never leaves the knitting bag, and in particular if you go shopping to add yarn to your \\"stash\\", this book could assist you in visualizing projects and more importantly, buying the right amount of yarn. That way, when you pull the yarn from storage on a cold winter day when you want to start something new, you will have  pattern, yarn and ideas all handy, thanks to this book. A real winner, and absolutely a great gift if you know any new knitters.	2004-08-26

Then meal preparation daily is a matter of thawing the menu.<br /><br />The author gives excellent advice on shopping the grocery stores (have you SEEN the prices lately? The oil price increase has caused food prices to go up, as American food is trucked in a long way.) Taylor-Hough tells the reader to check store brands, which in many cases are excellent and even might be made by brand-name manufacturers and just private-labeled. Shopping the sale items can mean many dollars saved off the final total. I concur--we do this and it's amazing how much you save if you are not an impulsive buyer. She also recommends listing the contents of the freezer on the outside on a piece of paper. It is a great idea. Nothing gets lost that way and you can take inventory before you go shopping and most importantly, avoid leaving things too long in the freezer.<br /><br />The author gives ideas for finding freezers such as ads in the paper and asking around--sometimes people even give them away. In our case, we bought a simple one from the local appliance store when it went on sale. The problem with the side by side or top/bottom fridge freezer is that it is too small and it's typically a no-frost model and tends to damage the food after a while with the defrost cycle. A chest freezer that doesn't automatically defrost is a better bet for long storage.<br /><br />The book has recipes for dishes like burritos, sloppy joes, meatloaf and meatball base, casseroles, desserts and even a holiday set up. My only quibble is that the recipes aren't things we routinely eat, and are very average recipes at best.  But if you follow Taylor-Hough's advice and substitute what you prefer, taking in account that not every finished dish freezes well, then you can take advantage of her system.<br /><br />A freezer plus cooking for a month (or two weeks, if you choose) can save you time, and money going to fast food, pizza delivery or take-out. I can tell you that following her shopping advice would pay back the cost of a freezer for a family in a couple of months. Try it out.ivery or take-out.

Cat Bordi has figured out how to do a moebius strip knit technique without grafting. Now, the late great Elizabeth Zimmermann made a moebius scarf by knitting on a provisional cast on and then grafting the scarf with a half twist to get the single sided mathematical puzzle we call a moebius. But Ms. Bordi figured out how to cast on over a doubled, long circular needle and get a moebius in one seamless garment.<br /><br />There are patterns for, yes, scarves, but also some interesting hats including the very Sumerian looking \\"Tresses\\" cap, some shawls with shaping that turn the scarf into a poncho or capelet, and FELTED boot socks. These are amazing. If you like interesting knitting, this is absolutely a must.	2004-08-20

However, the treatment of the subject has Marley's originality and ability to create entire worlds and societies in a few deft strokes.<br /><br />Mother Burke, a member of the Magdalenes, a female Catholic priesthood, is tapped to investigate the finding of a survivor of an old colony on a planet being used for Earth expansion and enterprise. After a tragic first contact, a child is brought back to Earth. But she is not all she seems to be. An alien (in which case, the planet is rendered useless for colonization) or is she the descendent of an ill-fated settlement from centuries ago? And why is she being kept in quarantine far longer than the six-month mandatory period, and by a very shady doctor.<br /><br />Isabel Burke is a fascinating character. She is doing penance as a Magadalene as well as fulfilling a vocation. She is also a scientist and a sympathetic character with a mix of backbone and tenderness. One wants to learn more about her, hence my feeling that \\"Child Goddess\\" could be worthy of a sequel. Her order of woman priests is also interesting; imagine the history that was behind a church finally granting disciple status to Mary Magdalene and validating the Gospel of Mary.<br /><br />Oa, the child, is interesting. Marley borrows from Australian aborigine customs as well as African to create her alien, and Oa is cast well in the role of a naive, yet sophisticated person.<br /><br />Though I found the plot entirely predictable, I still raced through the book with enjoyment and hope for more from this author.	2004-08-14

But Appelbaum's translation unaccountably drifts from the literal into some vagaries that cause the wonderful humor to be lost; example:<br /><br />When Madame Peloux and her cronies are meeting for tea and cards, the underaged and definitely stupid Prince Ceste discusses his family's anger at his affair with the seventy-year old Lili. He states \\"My family wants to shut me up in a convent (couvent)\\" Couvent is convent, and Ceste is plainly a bit mixed up, but Appelbaum changes the sentences indicate a monastery and explain \\"Like shutting up a girl in a convent.\\" The humor of Prince Ceste's mistake is lost. The beauty of the language, with its subtle jokes is lost time and again--another example, where Lea wonders who fathered Cheri. In French, she wonders where Madame Peloux fished, to bring up such a magnificent specimen, but the English is completely dull and boring, missing the fishing metaphor entirely.<br /><br />If you want a lovely translation, look for the one by Antonia White. If you want a side by side French/English version in ADDITION to White's amusing English version, I can recommend this edition. However, if you've never read \\"Cheri\\" in English, I'd suggest starting with White. And is it worth to read \\"Cheri\\"? Definitely. Why this hasn't been filmed, I'll never know. It reads like a screenplay and it is set in the last of Paris just after fin de siecle and pre-WWI, when Europe changed forever. It's charming, and a wonderful novel.	2004-08-08

He was not a &quot;war hero&quot;--instead, his role was as a non-combatant, as a clerk and photographer and assisting the 336th Assault Helicopter Company in making maps for missions. He had a number of roles as a non-combatant in Viet Nam, moving around the country, starting as an information sergeant, ending up in intelligence. But the real story Webster tells is of the life of a soldier off-duty in Viet Nam.<br />The stories  are of a soldier's daily life, human interest stories. The problems with a wife in distant Oklahoma, the girls he meets, loves and loses in Viet Nam. Webster was no angel though he tried to be a gentleman. So this book has stories of pimps, prostitutes and sex and drinking. Nothing you wouldn't have heard from the average Nam vet, but still, beware this isn't a pretty tale in every aspect. But it's an honest one. Webster talks about his own faults, while trying to give the reader a feel for what life was like during the war.<br />The writing is pretty good--Webster can tell a story well. The photos are grainy as one would expect in a paperback edition and that's a shame--I can tell some of them are excellent photos and I'd love to see them reproduced as they are meant to be seen. I enjoyed the book a lot; it reminded me of the tales my classmates and friends told me about their time in Viet Nam.	2004-07-05

A friend once invited us to Australia and he and his wife actually do this RV thing in the States: they buy a motorhome, travel around the US (they are missionaries on furlough) then sell it and return back to Australia. Here, Carolyn Harris tells you how to purchase an RV and how to survive the North and South Islands of this beautiful country.<br />The book actually assumes you know a bit about RV's--there is terminology and technical discussion that someone who already toured in an RV might be more familiar with. Carolyn advises you on motor memberships (AAA and KOA), money, dealing with the Kiwis, where to go, what to eat and even, how to talk--there is a glossary of Kiwisms in the back of the book.<br />I enjoyed reading the glossary as much as the book and was interested in how a country so remote can be so like us and so unlike us in every way. If you are considering an extended stay in an RV down in the Roaring Forties (fortieth parallel south and beyond) this book is a worthy guide.	2004-06-29

Is Josh able to bring people back from the dead, and why is he always being picked on? The mystery unfolds with great care, and we are kept in suspense the entire time, wondering how a vial of ancient blood could match Josh's DNA, and whether or not he's more than just a boy with an unusual gift.<br />The story has been compared to &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; but I think it's rather different, and it certainly is my pick for the 2004 &quot;Summer Beach Read Award.&quot; If you want a fast-paced mystery, this certainly is a great choice. I couldn't put it down. This is Dr. Burnett's first novel (another is on the way) and I am looking forward to reading more from this novelist.	2004-06-10

His gentle, self-deprecating style of humor and the portraits of the Yorkshire Dales farmers and country people are amusing and interesting.<br />The four books, named after a hymn &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; are joined by this fifth volume with similar stories. James (as Alf called himself) now has his own practice in Skeldale House, is married with two kids. The stories are very similar to the first four, with goof-ups, miracles, and funny tales. Somehow, these stories are not quite as hilarious as the first set, possibly because Mr. Herriot had written up most of the good stuff, or to represent the seriousness of raising two kids and having his own practice and being a settled man rather than a raw youth just out on his own. Nonetheless, if you lapped up all the &quot;Creature&quot; books, as I did, and you mourn the loss of Dr. Wight, who passed away in the 90's, then you will want to read these stories and vicariously enjoy more of the daily life of a country vet.	2004-05-25

Sometimes, Richard appears on NPR, but until you can hear him live, &quot;Get Thee to a Punnery&quot; will be the best way to sample his intellectual brand of zany humor.

(And don't forget, Butterfly was once Flutterby, but we just couldn't get it straight.)  Riddles are great for long car rides--rhymes will tempt even the most lackluster reader to stretch their abilities.

But eventually, two of the five were singled out for horrific treatment. If you've read &quot;A Child Called It&quot;, this is a similar story of one violent parent with a complicit partner. In the case of Richard and his brother Randall, the grandparents knew and were either cowed or didn't want to go for family service help. The pastor, teachers all observed bruises and burns but somehow, no one felt like intervening in this sickening saga of abuse.<br />Were it not for the fact that I know people who worked at a Boston rescue house for children  and that they have told me that many of the kids come in with a history of incredible abuse, I might be tempted to disbelieve parts or all of this story. But I don't disbelieve any of it. And neither should you. While this is hard stuff to read, it's no more extreme than some stories recently in the newspapaer.<br />The book is relatively well-written, and the second volume is a continuation of the story as the boys grow up and eventually leave home. If you liked &quot;Sibyl&quot; or &quot;A Child Called It&quot; you will want to read these volumes.	2004-05-14

While there are many good books on color and pigment, Dobie explains how light in a painting scene shifts moment by moment and how you have to be ready to capture that brilliant moment with the right palette.<br />The book gives advice on which colors to put in a limited palette for brilliance. (As anyone who has done watercolor even for a short time knows, there are hundreds of colors available, but when you MIX them, sometimes you get a flat, dull result that looks like mud on the paper.) Choosing a limited and CORRECT palette for the painting you are going to do is one of the most critical steps after creating the composition. Dobie includes important facts about which paints stain the paper (and cannot be lifted up again), which are transparent and can be used as a wash or glaze, and which paints are opaque.  And if you follow the &quot;purist&quot; rule of no white paint, you learn how to leave the whites (use the paper for brilliant whites) and no black paint (which causes a visual hole in the paper.) Instead, Dobie shows the student painter how dark colors like brown or a visual black can be mixed that still look luminous and interesting on the paper. This is a very difficult technique to master--shadow detail can make or break a painting.<br />I disagree with one of her points, however, on mixing greens. While it is true that green pigments direct from the tube are far more brilliant and transparent than any you can mix, I find certain mixed greens from yellows and blues to be subtle for shadowed foliage, and sometimes the pure paint greens are jarring and unnatural to me. I tried to follow this &quot;use unmixed&quot; greens rule, and I end up mixing mine anyway, though I own many shades of green paints.<br />Of course, the best part of the book are the paintings. These are inspiring to the reader, but this author can also write and explain herself well. This book should be a standard on any watercolorist's shelf.e a standard on any watercolorist's shelf.	2004-05-13

Diabetes, unexplained weight gain of over one hundred pounds--it all was attributed to being &quot;in her head&quot; despite the fact she was eating right and exercising a great deal. Well, the disease WAS in her head--she had a benign pituitary tumor that was causing the dangerous hormonal imbalance of the adrenals. This imbalance is known as Cushing's Disease and can eithe be rooted in the adrenal glands themselves (small glands over the kidneys) or in the brain, in the master gland itself. Tumors of the pituitary can be quite dangerous, causing wild fluctuations of various hormones and also deep depressions. They are a serious matter, though treatable.<br />After her diagnosis, Ms. Garnier then had difficulties getting proper treatment in a timely matter. Ultimately, she had an operation and is now in good health again, but her struggle with the medical profession is enlightening.<br />If you have an illness, even if it isn't Cushing's Disease, this book is helpful as a very poignant story about how assertive one has to be with one's own doctors.  If you do have Cushing's Disease, this is a helpful story to provide hope, information and also coaching for your own treatment.	2004-05-13

First off, this is a book with both knitting WITH beads and beaded knitting (The former is knit fabric embellished with knit-in beads, the latter is fabric OF beads, with thread holding them into the mesh. No yarn showing.) Most of the projects are knitting with beads or even sewing them on, but Chapter Five is all beaded knitting. Some space is devoted to embellishing with sewn-on beads.<br />The projects are varied--something for everyone from jewelry and bags to socks to sweaters. There are many pages devoted to different techniques--so despite a good selection of patterns, this book encourages the knitter or crocheter to go out on their own.<br />A selection of projects:<br />1. A plum colored crocheted beaded vest. VERY impressive.<br />2. Several beaded scarves<br />3. A &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; collar in champagne color, almost Victorian looking.<br />4. Quite a few bags including some totes, some evening bags and an amulet bag in beaded knitting.<br />5. Pullovers--cabled with beads, and a faux-textured knit with beads replacing the texture stitches (hard to explain, but it's very graphic looking and interesting.) A linen African-looking vest in neutral shades with oblong beades.<br />6. Socks, hats<br />7. Two Forties-looking short sleeve blouses with beads<br />8. A wide-collared paillette (big flat sequin) top that looks like the wide off-the-shoulder styles out now, but harks back to the Fifties. This is crocheted.<br />I think Lily has outdone herself here. These designs are fascinating. And it's not just projects-- the instructions to design your own bead work, including some bead chart paper, are unique among knitting books. I think this book is a must for any serious knitter's  or crocheter's library.	2004-05-09

She recommends EVERYONE to use the technique of painting negative space to improve their art. Negative painting is going AROUND the outline of a subject, the way you might lay down a leaf on a white sheet of paper. Then dab paint around it. Lift off that leaf and you have a white leaf floating on a colored ground.<br />The book has the following chapters:<br />Basic Painting Supplies<br />Underpaintings - laying the groundwork<br />Getting into Shapes - become aware of negative shapes!<br />Working with Glazes and Building Layers<br />Building Nature's Complex Shapes<br />Picture Planning Made Easy<br />Assembling the Pieces of the Puzzle<br />The author says this technique applies to all media (certainly those who do charcoal or pastel are well aware of the importance of negative space, as are sculptors.) As a watercolorist, if you concentrate on line and wash, this will be quite revealing. In fact, this is probably a \\"must-have\\" on the technique bookshelf.	2004-04-26

Goldmine is arguably one of the most powerful contact management software database packages available, competing with ACT! and even Outlook for the important task of keeping sales contacts and activities and distributing information about them to others in your organization. Goldmine is notoriously difficult because of the very power and complexity. Will this &quot;DUMMIES&quot; book help you master it?<br />The problem with this book is that it gives some outlined use instructions for Goldmine but in NO WAY replaces a structured training course. If you have some experience with database management, you can pick your way through Goldmine, learning experientially, and this book is better than randomly poking at the keys.<br />The very best part is Part III: Managing Activities. This goes over scheduling, viewing, completing, forecasting and filtering activities. The other chapters are similar--outlines of typical activities like distributing information to your organization, entering contact info, etc. But this is not an exhaustive tutorial book, more like a series of schematics on how to get things done in Goldmine.<br />If you need more depth, or are starting from ground zero, this helps you avoid some landmines in Goldmine, but won't get you completely to the expert status. In summary, helpful, quick to read, not the complete story.	2004-04-22

So she was raised, not with the more familiar Ashkenazi (European) Jewish traditions, customs and music, but with those of the Middle East. She explained about Sephardim (&quot;Spanish&quot; Jews who left the Mideast and returned later in history)and Mizrahim, Jews who never ever had left the Mideast. And there is strife among the groups, who engage in discrimination based on widely different cultural values and lifestyles, though all believe in the same G-d and follow the same scriptures.<br />The essays go into much detail about individual lives of women who experienced this discrimination or outright, terrible oppression at the hands of local people in their homelands -- Iraq, Iran and other places. Some of the stories are frightening; in one essay, the writer describes a horrifying massacre in Iraq. Her parents were then left literally stateless, their passports invalid and no land accepting them for refugee status. It's hard not to cry while reading this story. Others talk about a shameful treatment of returnees to Israel, and the division in the communities there. Some of the writers tried to &quot;pass&quot; as French Jews rather than Moroccan, to avoid being treated as an underclass exactly as African-Americans experience in the United States. These stories made me so angry.<br />The essays are also a unique view inside Jewish traditions that are probably as unfamiliar to most Jews as they would be to non-Jews. It was a revelation that some Hebrew is spoken with an Arabic accent, using Arabic words. I couldn't put this book down, and I think anyone interested in the struggles in the Mideast ought to read this, and definitely, if you are Jewish, you should not pass up this book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2004-04-03

Books	5	318	334	N	N	Better than I thought it would be	This book has much information about healthy diet, lifestyle and medicine. Dr. Mercola pointed out in a recent talk we attended in Philadelphia that the third leading cause of death for Americans was --doctors. Sorry, doc, but iatrogenic (doctor-caused) complications are plentiful. Still, this statistic may be misleading as a lot of doctoring goes on in the expensive, last few months of life for terminally-ill and geriatric patients. So the number of complications due to procedures and drug interactions is possibly skewed here--if you read the medicare reports and read between the lines.<br />STILL, I prefer prevention. Dr. Mercola is a sort of Dr. Weil for the millenium, similar advice, more detail and his own slant on diet and health. Essentially, he advises vegetables, low to no grains--reduces insulin fluctuations, and healthy meats. He insists most people find that they are not served well by a vegan (no milk, meat, egg) diet and actually it could harm them. Yes, some folks are more than well on a vegan diet; it depends on your metabolic type, according to Mercola. For many, meat or fish are important. This is the &quot;Atkins&quot; type diet with an emphasis on healthy choices.<br />We liked a lot of the recipes in this book. Some were even  delicious; &quot;zucchini spaghetti&quot; is a boon for the low-carb eater, thin strips of squash serve as a low-carb base for a tasty sauce. And a home-made sausage patty I liked, plus a spicy Jamaican rub for chicken or fish.<br />The recipes in &quot;Total Health&quot; are for the most part, pretty easy. The ingredients are what's more difficult to come by--for example, free range poultry, bison (buffalo), raw milk and Alaskan salmon, tested free of detectible mercury. But even in our rural area, we can order bison and salmon to be shipped in, and the raw milk is available over the border in Amish country. So while not every area in the US can obtain organic veggies and meats by walking to the store, even remote areas can find ways to get these items. If you were to adhere to the Mercola diet, a chest freezer could be helpful to freeze sporadic purchases of organic perishables.<br />How to get in those vegetables for brekkie really stumped us, until we tried the fearsome green shake, consisting of vegetable juice, whey powder, egg and greens powder, with coconut for flavor and its own benefits. This powerful smoothie is a quick pick-me-up for the morning rush and easily assimilated. We liked it, surprised how much so.<br />This diet and lifestyle is not easy, and the guy at home frankly said &quot;No WAY am I eating veggies for a snack, thank YOU very much!&quot; but adding the additional greens and of course healthy choices is doing us good, we are sure. A provocative book, with a great number of resources.s can find ways to get these items.

Her classic spiral-bound volume &quot;Knitting in the Old Way&quot; was a coveted book on knitters' shelves.<br />Thankfully, it's been reissued and revised in print so that new generations of knitters can take advantage of her knowledge and skill. Here is where you can learn all about the traditional method of Norwegian knitting, where you knit a multicolor tube and essentially cut and sew, and then knit in sleeves and neck finishing. Traditional Scandinavian patterns and Eastern European techniques are featured but there is a lot more. If you like the craft of knitting mixed with ethnic history and lore, this is unparalleled. Fun to read, and yet useful as a guide to designing and knitting your own garments.	2004-03-19

Now, after a lot of begging on the part of knitters around the world, Knitters Magazine and XRX Press have collected patterns by type from those hot issues and released them in book form. THANK YOU! Now I don't have to sift through back issues or beg copies of friends to find certain patterns I like.<br />There are a number of children's sweaters in the thickly-knit Aran style that are especially appealing, and many other knits including for MEN, who are sadly neglected in many other publications. If you longed to get your hands on some of the back issues for the Aran style knitting, this is a great resource. Note: Aran knitting is by nature complex though not impossible. This is probably best for middling-experienced knitters who have tried patterns with crossed, cabled and twisted patterns before. But not impossible even for a beginner who is determined. Hint: Swatches of the patterns help, and it helps to visualize the layout of the different stitches from a &quot;top down&quot; viewpoint as well as row-by-row.	2004-03-18

His style is to use a sort of ornamentation-on-steroids, a wild profusion of color and pattern to create a wash of color with pattern that looks logical in its confusion. His work never fails to amaze me. If you liked his earlier knit books, this Pattern Library is a really valuable addition. Instead of sweater patterns, this book has detailed charts of the designs and hints on how to knit them (such as the popular round Persian Poppy pattern that you can knit using a &quot;magic ball&quot; or random strands of yarn tied into a giant raggedy ball that yields fascinating results.) For those who design their own vests, pullovers, jumpers and coats, this is a really valuable reference book. Personally, I'd just use it to knit pillows and not even worry about creating a garment with the patterns. Plenty of color photos, detailed shots and a nice printing job, too. Highly recommended for knitters who love colorwork.	2004-03-18

Marge Piercy and Ira Wood have been around the block plenty of times, stubbornly making their living out of a love of writing. And a tough living it is, too. While bestselling authors can make megabucks, most writers earn their bread the hard way: &quot;$124,000, and it took four years of my life.&quot; You do the math.  Nevertheless, Wood and Piercy do not discourage the artist; instead they nurture with motherly advice on agents, and bittersweet tales, such as the story of &quot;Kitchen Man&quot;, Wood's exemplary novel (excerpted in the appendix) that goes from campus favorite to  out-of-print remainder in that too-short life cycle for so many excellent books.<br />There exercises, some to polish dialog, and my favorite exercise, a sort of checklist to get to know your characters that reads like a questionnaire for a dating service! There are anecdotes about other famous writing coaches, such as the story of a short novel that goes from  coach Maxine Kumin to Joyce Carol Oates.  Kunin advises the author that the work is going to be a short novella. &quot;No, it's a short novel of 180 pages&quot; declares Oates. When the manuscript was finished, Joyce then tells the author &quot;Treat this as if you are going to die. And this is what you will leave behind.&quot; Pithy. Meaningful. This is good writing coaching. This is a warm, wonderful book especially for the memoir or fiction writer.	2004-03-18

I like poetry with imagery that resolves into a shift in vantage point; this is something of which Marge Piercy is a master. The poems are in some aspects raw and gutsy, others are lyrical and meditative. I read &quot;The Doughty Oaks&quot; outloud to someone who also admired its tight imagery of a miser in rags, and the contradiction at the end of the poem. The last set of poems in the book are based on the Celtic Lunar calendar (in name only, this isn't Wicca) as a way for Piercy to celebrate the lunar calendar of the body and of the Jewish religion as well--whose festivals fall on lunar dates and account for our shifting Easter holiday.  Well worth reading if you like poetry. This is one book I will be pulling off the shelf from time to time, to find new aspects of meaning.	2004-03-17

They begin with &quot;No&quot; and giving permission for the other party to say &quot;no.&quot;<br />The brilliance of the  &quot;no&quot; can be the important &quot;way out&quot; in a negotiation, where one party is offered a graceful exit to avoid the sense of feeling trapped or tricked. And it's also the path to finding out what they really need or really can accept.  But it's much more than that.<br />Camp informs the reader that previous theories of negotiation such as &quot;Win-Win&quot; are pure bunkum; in negotiation, sometimes someone wins and someone else loses. But the long-term outcome may be quite different--what might have been compromised into a mediocre solution by win-win can often be better for both parties when one loses at the outset. Case in point; a contract is drawn up with terms that one party can no longer fulfill. It's time to renegotiate the contract despite the terms and conditions. Why? What if the contract specified that a vendor sell at a price that would drive them out of business? If the buyer NEEDS that product, they'd better negotiate rather than fail to receive the product. Going elsewhere to find it could be more costly than the re-negotiated price.<br />Camp's experiences are in direct contrast to some of business guru Stephen Covey's &quot;Seven Habits of Highly Successful People&quot;, which I thought was quite interesting. To remind you, the habits are:<br />1- Be Proactive<br />2- Begin with the End in Mind<br />3- Put First Things First<br />4- Think Win/Win<br />5- Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood<br />6- Synergize<br />7- Sharpen the Saw<br />Mr. Camp actually has no issue with the majority of these habits, but he disagrees vehemently with two of the seven principles: #2--begin with the end in mind, and #4 Think Win/Win. In the case of negotiation, sometimes, Mr. Camp informs us, it's better not be so focused on the goal i.e, getting the lowest price, making that sales quota for that month) lest you appear needy. What's more, being too focused on your own goal might cause you to make dangerous assumptions or fail to realize the underlying situation. And Camp scoffs at the idea of win-win, giving the reader plenty of real-life examples where losing either was just that...losing, or was a neutral outcome (no win, but better than other potentially worse outcomes.)<br />I recommend this book to anyone getting ready to negotiate nearly anything, from extended bedtimes for your kids, to a refinanced mortgage to a multi-million dollar deal. Excellent material here from this experienced contrarian.en principles: #2--begin with the end in mind, and #4 Think Win/Win.

But many low carb diets don't focus on the quality of the food you eat. Dr. Mercola takes a holistic approach and really reasons out WHY grains are associated with weight gain, and what a low-carb diet could look like if you believe organic vegetables and meats are important, and that artificial sweeteners may be causing you difficulties.<br />This is a more difficult path in some ways than buying boxes of low-carb sweets and bread mixes, and eating salads from the cellophane packages. Dr. Mercola encourages green vegetable juicing (no carrots or apple) with the pulp of the vegetables stirred back in, raw organic eggs, whey protein and chlorella algae to make a green breakfast shake to start your day. This is rugged stuff. After buying a dozen fresh eggs from the farmer down the road (living in a rural area has some advantages) I dug out the juicer and hand blender and whipped up one of these pea-green smoothies. I drank it down, humming the theme from &quot;Rocky&quot; to get up the nerve. It wasn't delish--but I did get a burst of energy that lasted well past what would have been lunchtime.<br />Mercola doesn't like soy (toxic to thyroids? has female hormone-like effects on men? Is this true?) and he really limits even favorite vegetables like carrots (too sugary) and beets (same deal.) However, he recommends you eat organic beef, ostrich, buffalo, organic chicken, fish, lamb. No pork. And plenty of good vegetables like dark leafy greens, cucumbers, fennel, spinach, celery, mushrooms and such. And organic eggs. This is not all bad. As you reduce weight, you can add in some fruit and mild sweets like barley syrup and maple. De. Mercola has some compelling arguments against aspartame, sucralose and saccharine.<br />While more severe in the types of foods you can eat, Mercola claims that your health will improve. On the psychological end, he advocates &quot;EFT&quot; --a sort of tapping that takes about three minutes, starting with acupuncture points from head to torso, and is designed to talk you out of eating that piece of Devil's Food Birthday Cake that is tempting you in your office or the doughnut shop on the way home. Three minutes of tapping on points, or if you are needing discretion there is a shortcut after much practice, and you can hold your nose high and walk past the cheesecake. Hey --if it works, I'm all for it.<br />I like the book for the fearsome Green Drink and the list of healthful things to focus on in your diet. Dr. Mercola always tries to support his claims, and I am a reluctant fan. We call him &quot;The guy that HATES everything&quot; at home, but he does like good healthy fare and reducing cravings. It's sad that grains are a no-no, but they sure make me gain weight and make me sleepy and hungry. So maybe Dr. Mercola is on to something.uot;EFT&quot; --a sort of tapping that takes about three minutes, starting with acupuncture points from head to torso, and is designed to talk you out of eating that piece of Devil's Food Birthday Cake that is tempting you in your office or the doughnut shop on the way home.

This novel is not perfect, yet it is exciting and takes a great deal of risks in style and substance.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with much Chinese history of the Ching Dynasty (ending with \\"The Last Emperor\\" Pu Yi) it helps to know a few things beforehand. Orchid, or Yehonala (her family name) became \\"Tzu Hsi\\" --Empress of the Western Palace, and was known as The Dowager Empress to the Europeans. She ruled as regent for her infant son Tung Chih after the death of Hsien Feng. She survived a coup attempt, the Opium Wars, the Tai Ping rebellion in Nanking, and the Boxer Rebellion and she died in 1908, on the same day as her nephew, the emperor successor to Tung Chih, who died of smallpox not long after coming of age.<br /><br />A biography of the Empress by an English adventurer named  Backhouse was considered gospel truth by the British, who despised this stubborn woman who kept China from modernizing and prevented the Europeans from establishing as much of a colonial beachhead in China as they had done in India and Indonesia. Backhouse's work was only discredited in 1974, which I find amazing, as I read his book in 1971 and thought it was pure bunkum with stories that surely were colonial propaganda and sensationalism (his tales of sexual escapades and sado-masochism were pure Victorian English erotic fantasy.)<br /><br />Anchee Min plays some interesting turns on well-known history events (the selection of concubines after the death of the first Empress, the flight of the Imperial Household to Jehol during one European invasion, the death of Hsien Feng amid the struggle of his Viceroy Su Shun to become Regent, and Yehonala's rise to power.) The real story is vastly different -- actual events are sketched in altered form or as they were reported to happen, depending on Min's novelistic requirements.<br />What author Min is apparently attempting is an internal history, the development of the China's most powerful rulers rising from poverty-stricken and uneducated girl. It echoes the rise of Madam Mao during the Cultural Revolution, a subject of another of Min's novels (\\"Becoming Madam Mao.\\") As a work, the novel is flawed; characters are developed importantly, then dropped except for trifling reappearances (Yehonala's siblings, the Dowager foster-mother of Hsien Feng.)  There is a lot of improbability and derivative plot device (the education in a whorehouse to learn erotic technique and the poisonous plotting of the other wives of Hsien Feng seems to owe more than a little something to novels such as Barbara Chase-Riboud's \\"Valide\\", the story of a concubine who rises to power in Ottoman Turkey.)<br /><br />But despite the literary vagaries, this is an exciting read, not quite as good as I'd hoped, and not nearly as good as Pearl Buck's version \\"Imperial Woman\\" which is just as inaccurate historically. Anchee Min takes risks, and though this may not be her finest work, I think she will continue to delight and amaze her readers with her style.uthor Min is apparently attempting is an internal history, the development of the China's most powerful rulers rising from poverty-stricken and uneducated girl.

When Jesus was a baby, Herod commanded that all male infants under the age of two were to be killed, a Draconian plan to find the prophesied King of Kings. Joseph is directed in a dream to take his family to safety in Egypt, and we learn little else that he went, taking Mary and Jesus, and subsequently returned.<br /><br />What happened during the time the family dwelt Egypt is not part of the official Gospels. There are the secret \\"Infancy Gospels\\"--  and some of the books of Apocrypha that deal with Jesus' childhood--not officially Biblical truth. What Perry finds out is that the process of creating and transmitting oral legends, some of which were written into the Apocrypha, is still a process going on today. Visit any town along the path the Holy Family took through Egypt and those who are Christians are still telling those legends--and creating them.<br /><br />This process amazes the author. Among the Coptic Christians, truth seems to be a matter of possibilities --and impossibilities. If a bishop has a dream about what happened to Jesus as an infant in Egypt, this becomes a new legend.<br /><br />Some of the legends told by the locals sound more like Semitic tales of wisdom or riddles such as Solomon would have faced. Other tales are of miracles that remind one of the wedding of Cana or tell of the raising of the dead. The fact that Jesus didn't start his ministry until Cana and until he was well into adulthood is irrelevant to these legends. Which gives insight into how legends are formed and passed on. And also insight into why officially, some books of scriptural writing are included the Gospel and others were rejected.<br /><br />But Perry isn't really writing about Biblical truth; he is writing about people and their sacred traditions. And at the end, he finds a holy family of his own; he takes care of a pair of widows in a truly Christian manner. This story is about his quest and about the culture of the people in Egypt. It's beautifully written, and of interest to anyone who loves travel, legends, and meeting people in a culture different than ours. Highly recommended.nner.

But the FDA reviewer is unaccountably unencouraging when meeting with one of ImClone's top scientists. What is wrong? Is Erbitux, instead of being approved , instead going have its application refused? Why! And what will this mean for the high-flying ImClone stock?<br /><br />The book reads like the best thriller, and author Alex Prud'homme is adept at making you feel like the proverbial fly-on-the-wall during the action. If you are at all interested in what happened behind the Martha Stewart debacle, you must read this. It's fantastic.	2004-02-22

This stitch dictionary is distinguished from many others by not only the interesting stitches, but by the organization of it. There is a table of contents consisting of thumbnail photos, organized by stitch type, at the beginning of the book.<br />The stitches are all done in a neutral color yarn to show the texture, some done in mohair or fuzzy yarn to show how the stitch works especially well in such yarns. If you like to knit and design your own patterns such as socks, shawls, scarves or sweaters, this is a wonderful book for reference.

But definitely, low carb diets work for you (and me.) So what to do? The \\"South Beach\\" diet is a modification of a low-carb diet with the twist of \\"good fats\\" and \\"bad fats.\\" Good fats in this case are oils like olive and NOT butter fat. And not all carbs are bad--high fiber wheat breads come back into the picture far sooner than on the Atkins diet.<br />For those bored with no-carb diets, this is a real boon. Relatives of mine report significant weight loss; the jury is out with me. But to be able to eat some carbs in moderation would indeed be nice. Any diet that limits one food group to extreme is difficult to maintain for a long haul.

Various charitable societies worked strenuously to ameliorate the worst of the slums, to pass laws requiring light and air in tenements, though landlords were clever in circumventing or perverting the legal requirements (a window in a room could be on an inside wall; the airshaft--a thin passageway between buildings was all the air many apartments got.) Schools were at first overcrowded rooms with no desks, no ventilation and seventy students attempting to learn. Reformers got desks, ventilated buildings, smaller class sizes. This is a fascinating story of how people worked together to try to better an abusive situation in the poorest sections of American cities.	2003-12-31

How did our grandfathers and great-grandfathers (and great-great, I suppose) survive immigration and the slums? What was life like on the Lower East Side of New York? For those of us whose family has only been in the US for a few generations, this is a must-read. Whether Irish, Italian, Jewish, Chinese or Polish, German, Russian, hordes of refugees ended up in New York on the promise of a better life.<br />Reading Riis' book reads like the newspaper in some ways; entrepreneurs lured poor people from Eastern Europe and contracted out their labor in sweat shops in the US. Sound familiar? But what is not so familiar are the living conditions in the tenements, dark, unventilated cages in blocks of buildings that rented for a surprising high rent to people who died by the thousands in the unsanitary conditions. Farm animals had it better. Why was rent so high? Supply and demand. Cheaper rent was to be had in Brooklyn and the outlying (as yet unincorporated) boroughs, but the WORK was in Manhattan, where you could get by as a tailor, a seamstress, a peddler or in some illegitimate activity.<br />The conditions will make you cry; the story of foundling babies (abandoned newborns) is astonishing. A cradle was put outside a Catholic Church and instead of a baby each night, racks of babies appeared. The Church had to establish foundling hospitals run by nuns, who persuaded the unwed or impoverished mothers to nurse the baby they gave up, plus another baby (women can usually nurse two, though these malnourished women must have been hard-pressed.) The child mortality rate, especially in the \\"back tenements\\" or buildings built on to the back of others (dark and airless) was incredible.<br />I wish the plates in the book were of better quality; Riis took many photographs, but the reproduction here is poor and they are hard to see. I recommend that if you are interested in this subject from seeing \\"The Gangs of New York\\" or for genealogical reasons, that you visit the Lower East Side Tenement Museum and see the buildings for yourself. Even cleaned up and no longer packed with unwashed people, they are heart-rending.Side Tenement Museum and see the buildings for yourself.

If you have a sales force to train, this is an essential text, short enough and clear enough to use for the sales professional.<br /><br />The Principles:<br /><br />A. Separate the people from the problem: taking things personally makes for vested interests. Keeping these separate makes for objectivity. Maybe obvious, but essential.<br /><br />B.  Focus on interests, not positions: People tend to feel they lose if they shift position. An interest more objective. There can be multiple interests, and interests come in varied strengths.<br /><br />C. Try to invent options for mutual gain: It's a win-win game.<br /><br />D. You must insist on objective criteria: this is the first step to getting to \\"yes\\" in an argument. If something is held objective, it is easier to accept.<br /><br />This should be on everyone's business shelf. A good beginning for learning negotiating skills.	2003-12-30

Books	4	3	3	N	N	Primes the pump with ideas for active retirement	This is a much more practical book than some of the \\"100 things you can do when retired\\" books that suggest babysitting, dogwalking or other simplistic ideas. Mary Helen Smith lists 101 things you should think about or do, like consider what is \\"quality of life\\"--for example, downsizing your house versus staying in an expensive piece of real estate, and listing government programs for retirees, something you may not know about. In addition, she stresses understanding about money.<br /><br />Once you are on a fixed income, and one that is possibly lower than your salary, you must deal with money in a different manner. Now is the time to learn about finances and money, not after you've gotten your first social security check. With many millions of people hitting retirement or near-retirement age from the Baby Boom, this is a really good starting-off point to plan out your coming retirement years. Highly recommended.

I have read the Backhouse account that Seagrave attributes to besmirching the Empress's reputation and I agree, it's imaginative, inflammatory rot. The Backhouse bio attributes some sexual exploits of the author so is completely suspect. But it was taken as gospel for years. This biography is more balanced, and shows the various sides of the despotic but venerated ruler who tried to stem the tide of modernism in Old China, and failed. The onslaught of the Western culture broke down centuries of stable peasant culture, making way for the Revolution. An interesting look into the last remnants of Imperial China.	2003-12-29

The author does a creditable job in creating, not only the mise-en-scene of pre-Revolution China, during the very last days of the Qing Dynasty, but she creates a living, breathing, almost-larger-than-life character in Yehonala or Tzu-Hsi (Cixi) as she was later known.<br /><br />Tzu-Hsi was the Dowager Empress of China, the widow of Emperor Xianfeng (Hsien-feng in the older Wade-Giles transliteration, which is used throughout the novel.) Xianfeng was a relatively weak ruler, beset by the Taiping Rebellion in the southern part of China (which was led by a charismatic ruler Hong who claimed to be a reincarnation of Christ) and the influx of Europeans, who wished China to be open for trade. China, previously opened to trade during the Yuan (Mongol Dynasty) and the following Ming Dynasty, but subsequent dynasties closed China to foreign trade. The rulers feared not only incursion into territory (as was happening in India) but also influences that upset the very rigid social structure of Confucian beliefs,which were so deep-dyed in Chinese law, culture and thought that to obtain a post in the Imperial bureaucracy, one had to be deeply educated in Confucian writings and essays.<br /><br />Against this background of upheaval, Yehonala, daughter of a possibly disgraced minor official in one of the Manchu clans, though a powerful one, was chosen as a concubine (secondary wife) of Xianfeng. Her luck was that she bore him his only living male heir (later Tongzhi Emperor.) Yehonala, renamed Tzu-Hsi, conspired with powerful members of her clan and the emperor's most erudite brother Prince Gong, to keep Tongzhi in line of succession and her and the other empress of Xianfeng, Tzu-An, as co-regents. Her rise from concubine to empress, and then later, the true power, with the weaker male emperors as puppet rules, is an astonishing and exciting tale. The story takes us from Tzu-Hsi's childhood all the way to shortly before her death and the almost-simultaneous death of the Guangzhu Emperor (son of her sister.) He was succeeded by Pu-Yi, portrayed in a scene near the end of the book, and this is the emperor we know about from the popular film \\"The Last Emperor<br /><br />There is also a love story as a thread throughout the book; whether or not it is based on actual fact is up for speculation but rumors truly abounded that Tzu-Hsi had a very intimate relationship with a cousin, Jung-Lu (Ronglu), with whom she had been betrothed.<br /><br />Some of the material Buck used for her research is somewhat discredited these days. A lot of the older biographies of the dowager empress reflected the Western frustrations and misunderstandings of the vast Chinese empire, its history and its customs. A newer biography, [[ASIN:0307271609 Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China]] is possibly the best bio I've read so far, and will throw a lot of light on Cixi's relationship with her brothers-in-law and their role in the modernization of the Chinese empire. I recommend you read it if you read this novel; even though the events are cast in quite a different light, the background of Chinese history is valuable if you are new to to subject. The source material for \\"Imperial Woman\\" was in a good part derived from the memoir of Der Ling [[ASIN:147007561X Two Years in the Forbidden City]].<br /><br />Buck, despite the questionable sources that were possibly the only ones available to her, does a very good job in setting the historical background and telling an exciting tale. This is one of my favorite historical novels and fueled a lifelong interest in Asian history. It was one of the saddest moments of my trip to work in Beijing in 1999, that I had to pass by the gates of the Forbidden City and look at the high red walls and the huge gates, described so accurately in this novel, and not be able to go inside. (No time, and no interest by my business associates, who had little interest in Chinese history.)<br /><br />If you like historical novels, and are interested in Chinese history pre-Revolution, this is one of the best ones I can recommend, with the admonition that the historical facts are not at this time the version that is accepted by current scholars.<br /><br />Notes on the audio production and versions of character names:<br /><br />The audio production, with Kirsten Potter, is fairly good. Her take on Tzu-Hsi's subtle but inexorable will is to give her a smooth and evenly modulated voice. I always envisioned this character as having a lot more gusto in her vocalizations, so I had to get used to Potter's interpretation of this character. It is consistent throughout, though I wanted a bit more passion. There are musical interludes between sections of the book, the volume on these seems a bit loud to me compared to the vocal portions but the music and use of the music as a transition is quite acceptable.bed so accurately in this novel, and not be able to go inside.

The laws of Prosperity and Poverty are loosely fictionalized here, but I would not call this book fiction. Instead, the author lays out observations in the form of laws, and they are accurate and disturbing.<br />Let's take education, for example. Those who prosper (&quot;Spers&quot; in McKinnie's terms) are taught to lead. &quot;Povs&quot; or those in poverty are taught to be good employees. Is this just McKinnie's imagination? No indeed! Going back to the Prussian system of education and Dewey, the education system in much of Europe and definitely the government-funded schools in Britain and the US are geared to teach people to be docile employees. Sit still, obey, don't think, repeat what you're told, these are the values taught. The aim is to produce a tractable worker, not one who is given skills to be an entrepreneur. (And how many entrepreneurs are men or women who left college early, feeling that school was teaching them absolutely nothing? Many more than you'd suppose.)<br />Another rule: The Rule of Residency. &quot;Povs&quot; cannot reside in Prosperity longer than a month. A job evaporates, money is squandered, it's impossible to save, debts have to be repaid. The &quot;Pov&quot; may wander in and out of a prosperous situation, but the inability to maintain this state for a length of time condemns him to his low state.<br />The rule of legitimate activity: The &quot;Pov&quot; finds it difficult if impossible to engage in legitimate, profit-making activities. And laws are passed to institutionalize illegitimate activity, somewhat in the Hegelian Dialectic &quot;to make a criminal, create a law.&quot;<br />This is a thought provoking book, one that makes you look at poverty and prosperity in a systematic way, and how it is imbedded into our society. I really enjoyed reading it and thinking about what it has to say.	2003-12-28

Was it a reflection of a society gone soft, or were artists commenting on a deeper, more insidious type of rot? Thomas Mann used a tuberculosis sanitorium as a setting for a novel that symbolized a moribund society soon to be wracked by the death throes of the Great War. In England, Oscar Wilde celebrated the perverse and in the US, Poe explored the world of death and excessive mourning, rather like our current \\"goth\\" fad.<br />In France, a number of writers used the same themes of decay and decadence to comment on the world. In this collection of 12 novellas and short stories, editor Asti Hustvedt collects significant but minor works that illustrate the obsessions of the  Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle. Some of the works are obscure but worthy, and a few are stunning in their craft. Each work is introduced by the translator, with notes and commentary.<br />In particular, I found two of the works in this volume absolutely compelling. \\"Monsieur V&egrave;nus\\" written by Rachilde (pseudonym of Margu&eacute;rite Eymery) is an exploration of sexual reversal, perversion and hints at BDSM. The fact it was written by a woman, one extremely young, is a shocking look into a mind formed with definite and individualistic sexual ideas in youth. The end is shocking.<br />J-K Huysmans is better-known. The editor includes  a minor work of great artist skill \\"The Haven\\" explores decadent naturalism. The setting is a country chateau, and the main characters a Parisian couple, who are evading creditors and their peasant relations who offer then the haven at the farm and chateau while they regroup. But the wife is suffering from what is obviously later-stage syphilis and the hearty peasants make a living as parasites off the inept Parisians. While the superficial world is one of cattle, rustic caf&eacute; brawls and mud, the inner world is explored in a series of vivid nightmares, mixing sexual and necrophilic imagery. The internal state of mind of the main character is explored with amazing psychological detail and the end, though mundane and flat, leaves the reader wondering what horrors lie ahead for the hapless couple.

Something in my gut told me not to do it.\\" Oh, I've been there plenty of times. How do we harness that instinct, that gut feel that can guide us on a better path through life? Author Kathy Kolbe has a set of five rules to harness the hunch and a set of \\"think-ercises\\" to retrain your behavior. This is brilliant. In fact, this is one of the best self-improvement books I have ever read. I am serious!<br />The five rules are:<br />1. Act-before you think (scary!)<br />2. Self-provoke (stimulate your instincts)<br />3. Commit, but to very little<br />4. Be obstinate in overcoming obstacles<br />5. Do nothing when nothing works (stop beating that head against the wall.)<br />I am especially impressed with Kolbe's visualization chart of the Creative Process. This is quite different than the creative exercises I learned in the past.  Kolbe's process involves charting first motivation, then your inner talents, drives and energy, then your will and its commitment to the goal, followed by the reasoning and rationalization process to justify the action, and finally the behavior. This is not acting WITHOUT thinking; instead it is acting with a follow-through of self-examination that combines your subconscious hunches with rational thought and experiential data.<br />I also like the question set about instinct when something \\"feels wrong\\":<br />1. Is it the way you are approaching a task?<br />2. Do you feel you've done something wrong?<br />3. Are you feeling sick or run-down?<br />4. Does the way another person responds to you make you uncomfortable?<br />5. Is there something physically unsafe about your situation?<br />6. Are you ill at east with the way things are happening?<br />Look at the above list and look how that applies to so many situations in life. Let's take the decision to ride home with a friend after a party. If your feeling is you shouldn't get in the car, examine if you feel something is unsafe. Perhaps the friend had a few too many drinks. This list would be a good exercise to train teenagers to act on their inner voice of conscience, something to harness their good sense and channel it to better decisions. And of course, this list is essential for looking at your daily work life and perhaps deciding to move on to find other opportunities before you are forced by the situation to do so.

Tall and commanding, Meaulnes is soon the class leader, and gets the nickname \\"Le Grand Meaulnes\\" which translates perhaps as \\"Meaulnes the Great\\" --hard to put into English. One day, the headmaster sends a student off to the railway station to fetch a visiting relative, and Meaulnes, not chosen for this excursion, bolts out the window and presumably tries to hire a faster horse and carriage and beat the other student to the station. But Meaulnes gets lost, or goes in another direction deliberately, and fails to return that evening.<br />What happens next is filled with mystery and possibly magic or delusion. Meaulnes tries to find \\"the lost domain\\"--a mansion where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman. But the way is hidden from him, the map incomplete, and Meaulnes desperately tries to find his path again. The tone of somber mystery is dark and magical, and evokes a mood of ineffable sadness and delight. The novel is like reading a fairy tale mixed with a romantic novel, and we can only guess what Alain-Fournier would have done had he lived.	2003-12-27

Many of his books have excellent plots, but weak, cartoonish characters that could be found in any pulp novel. But &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; really breaks out of Asimov's usual mold. It's bold; alien characters with three sexes (and a description of how they do it) and an exciting parallel story that merges in surprising ways. While not my favorite of Asimov's books, I respect this novel for its creative delights. A good tale, interesting concepts, some of the best sci-fi Asimov wrote.	2003-12-27

Her missionary parents took her to China as a small child, and she traveled the world later. She only hints at very personal and painful events: the birth of her daughter with PKU (Phenylketonuria, a disease that causes retardation if not controlled with a special diet--unknown at that time) and a divorce as well. We do learn about the founding of her Amerasian orphan adoption agency, placing the unwanted children of Korean women and American soldiers, about her Nobel Prize for &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, and about life in China from the end of the Boxer Rebellion and the reign of the Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi to the republic of Chiang Kai-Shek before the Communist Revolution.<br />If you have read any of Pearl Buck's novels, this is a must-read to provide valuable background for the author's life.	2003-11-29

Plus there is a glossary of medical terms, and interesting info on why certain things happen the way they do in the hospital (for example, why can't you eat solid food for a while after general anaesthesia? Answer; your gut goes to sleep, too and needs to wake up! If you eat before the doctor or nurse hears the noises of a once-again active gut, you could throw up if you try to eat.)<br />Don't wait to find this book when you have a medical situation at home--this is a valuable reference to have handy if you should ever need it. Doctors often forget to tell patients and family valuable information because the time spent with the patient can be limited. Make the most of your consultation time with this list of intelligent and necessary questions.	2003-11-16

By that date, heart and kidneys had been successfully transplanted; could a brain transplant be somewhere in our future? This book seems to be in thirds: first, the transplantation of Johann Sebastian Bach Smith into a new body, then the new body. (But, oopsy, he got a female body, seems the crafty legal maven forgot to specify gender when he had his minions search out a blood-type match body.) Of course, hilarity ensues, scratch that, no hilarity, just a lot of giggling and sexual talk which for us sophisticates of the new millennium, seems overly coy, precious and downright annoying.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, my favorite science fiction author has always one of the trinity of Heinlein, Herbert and Asimov, and Heinlein on a bad day is often better than others at their very best, but this book is really not top-tier. Many ascribe its failings to the author's desperate illness, and I think that could be true; the parts of the book that truly annoy me (the middle, especially) are on themes that Heinlein had visited before (Stranger in a Strange Land) and would visit up through his very last novel; that is, what is LOVE, what is LOVING, and can people be polyamorous? Heinlein spends a lot of time on this, but the annoyance comes in HOW he describes frankly sexual situations, which devolve into giggling, innuendo, and fool no one but annoy everyone because it isn't erotic, it's more like silly kids giggling at dirty scrawls of chalk on the sidewalk. Yes, yes, I know what THAT is, now wash it off and you're getting a time-out.<br /><br />The first part of the book where technology, medical advances and a legal battle on identity with some avaricious heirs goes on, is great. I totally enjoyed it. Then in the second part of the book (spoiler here) when Eunice awakens after Johann's transplant, Johann, who is supposed to be a grouchy, dirty old man in a young, sexy beauty queen's body, is no longer the personality of the old codger but immediately becomes a giggling girly co-conspirator with Eunice and loses all the Johann-ness there ever was. Flaw number two (one being the giggling and simpering.) This part of the book makes Benny Hill's \\"sexy parties\\" look like the most sophisticated French farce humor to ever air on television.<br /><br />The third part of the book tries to recover, with the inevitable theme of polyamory (marrying more than one person or mixing it up with couples) and some drama that ends in even more ridiculous plot outcomes (no spoiler here, but how did Jake end up...well, you'll have to suffer through the entire thing just as I did.) Ultimately, the end failed and the entire last 2/3rds of the book just dragged the whole thing down to \\"sub-par.\\"<br /><br />I listened to the book in the Audible version (rather good), having read it once already (and tossed it in the trash heap.) Nope, only slightly better for the first section --which gave me false hope, no this wasn't Heinlein's moment to \\"jump the shark\\", but overall, it was as bad a book as I remembered. The one lonely star in the rating is for the first section, which was brilliant. The rest of the book was a huge let-down and positively irritating.queen's body, is no longer the personality of the old codger but immediately becomes a giggling girly co-conspirator with Eunice and loses all the Johann-ness there ever was.

He takes his sons on a long trek through Canada to learn about his origins. What is this second-largest country that is Not-US? First Malcolm discusses the geography that shapes the country's history and challenges. Typically, the British who founded Canada didn't give a fig for geographical considerations. The population clings to the shallow souther border except for the native residents, the Inuit. Malcolm visits with a number of people to get a sense of the Canadian character, but the most interested segment is his stay with Snowbird, a native whose knowledge of dogs and the wilds is unparalleled. And his fundamental philosophy of life is elemental and honest.<br />The other interesting part of the book is about the vast differences between the provinces; gigantic Quebec, with its French-speaking population, the impoverished Maritimes that once were the most important part of Canada, the vast prairies and oilfields of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Albert, and the rainforested British Columbia. Plus the unincorporated territories the Yukon and Northwest. Each is practically a country on its own, and it wasn't only Quebec that wanted to secede--so did Nova Scotia at one time.<br />While this is mostly a travelogue, it is an interesting view of Canada from one man's point of view. Interesting reading if not a factual history of Canada.	2003-11-06

Charles II, king of the glorious Restoration Period in English history, was a figure of legendary proportions, daring, physically commanding, surviving times of great danger after Cromwell's rule, living in tumultuous times of great scientific discovery, literature and some not-very successful wars against the Dutch.<br />The backdrop of Restoration society is fascinating, bawdy yet considering Shakespeare's plays too crude, wildly sexual, a time of tremendous change in England after the demise of the Tudors. It was a golden age of art and literature and the King was a dramatic figure, enjoying the embraces of comedian Nell Gwynn as well as a number of other famous mistresses, researching in his own laboratory, hunting, racing and swimming. His death at 55 seems a young age, but for those times, he survived to a respectable age and unlike many other kings, died in his bed. If you are interested in Restoration period literature, this is a fun read to set the backdrop for that interesting and fruitful period of European history.	2003-11-06

And if you are eating with non-low-carb family members who are chowing down stacks of fluffy pancakes, crunching toast, well, it gets a bit annoying. This book solves the issue of boredom with eggs, meat and fish. You get substitutes for ketchup, protein pancakes (thank heavens), a decent cinnamon raisin bread, peanut butter cookies, strawberry desserts and some entrees to spice up the fact you probably fell into the &quot;grilled meat and salad&quot; rut that I did. If you are on Atkins or other low-carb diets, this will keep you from getting annoyed at the very smell of someone else's toast in the morning.	2003-11-05

There are a lot of good salad recipes here, too. Many of them have a lot of mayonnaise, so are adaptable to low-carb diets. And there is a good discussion of chiles, from Anaheim, Poblano to Pequin and how to roast a green chile, skin it and freeze it for use later. If you like Southwestern cooking, which is spicy but not like Tex-Mex, this may interest you.	2003-11-04

Two needles can create a tube with some chicanery involving slip stitches. In a way it's simple, slip every other stitch and work it on the return row, slipping the knit stitches. Lo, a tube is formed.<br />The late Bev Royce was a minor genius, figuring out how to do this on her own and then her notes were transcribed after her death for the benefit of all. Some of this is hard to understand; there are new types of cast-ons to avoid a ridge, and increasing (to make a toe of a sock, for example) is not so simple. Still, with perseverance, you might be able to make the toy pony on the cover, quite an achievement in knitting.	2003-11-04

There are a lot of marinades that could be adapted to other items--you can miso-glaze chicken breast, or make flank steak in a number of flavorings.

And there is enough variety to please most knitters, with headbands, toques, berets and such. I found the designs less than inspiring, but the patterns can be adapted to your own tastes.

These are recipes garnered from individuals and they are authentic but unusual, like Rabbit in Balsamic Vinegar, Halibut with Mustard greens, plus plenty of breads like foccacia and sweets like pizzelle cookies.

Sadly, he was killed in the initial months of World War I at a tragically early age. Who knows what he would have accomplished? His sense of color and reduction of form and shape to flat, almost abstract design is revolutionary and paved the way for Cubism. He did watercolors, often as studies for his oils, and his paintings from Tunisia are especially beautiful. He portrayed the everyday (women shopping for hats, people sitting in cafes) in beautifully colored and composed paintings of light. If you don't know Macke's work, this is a fine introduction.	2003-11-03

Things that are typically felted are clogs or slippers, tote bags and vests, but you can do a lot more.<br />Bev Galeskas has some great instructions here, including an invaluable gauge check. You knit a square of a particular gauge, mark it with thread and then wash according to instructions. The thread marks the shrinkage and tells you how to adjust your knitting to get the felt to result in the size you desire.<br />There are also instructions for how to leave button holes or eyelets in the knitting so they don't close up, what yarns work well and which ones don't, how to felt in a front-loading washing machine (hint: it has to be the kind that lets you stop and open the door mid-cycle. My American front-loader does allow this but my European one did not. If you have the kind that locks during the cycle, Bev suggests you find a friend with a toploader and borrow their machine!)<br />The only small disappointment was that a pattern for felted clogs was not included. But there is a pattern for &quot;ballet slippers&quot; which do look something like clogs, so I suppose they can be sized up for adults, even men. Just don't CALL them ballet slippers. Felted clogs are very popular to make for gifts and to keep by the door as shoe-replacements to save your floors and carpets from wear and tear.	2003-10-31

At first, the explorers from the &quot;PPI&quot; or Planetary Protection, aren't even sure if what they are observing on Moss is an indigenous species. Rest assured, however, something is living there, and it may not be entirely friendly.<br />Jewel and her half-brother, the slimy Paul, go off on an expedition to Moss. Jewel is happy to leave Earth, which is overcrowded and being threatened by a draconian leadership with the extinction of the sad remnants of non-Human species which take up too much valuable space.<br />This novel is ambitious, complicated and darker in tone than &quot;Grass&quot; or &quot;Family Tree&quot; but is similar in ideology (ecological concerns, harmony with nature and all creatures.) The complexity of the system on Moss is like the complex interactions Tepper created in &quot;Six Moon Dance&quot; but with again, a darker tone. If you like imaginative science fiction that is not a re-hash of typical sci-fi generic themes, you will enjoy &quot;The Companions&quot; though it is not perhaps quite as good as &quot;The Fresco&quot;, &quot;Singer from the Sea&quot; and &quot;Six Moon Dance.&quot;	2003-10-31

Marta, an Italian who spent more time in France, first came as a French-speaking au pair to tempt the Kennedy kids into learning the language. While that dodge usually failed (she learned English), Marta had other talents. Watching the cooks wherever she went, Marta developed a skill in the kitchen and ended up as Mrs. Onassis' private chef.<br />Marta treats us to reminiscences about life with Jackie, home photos, and a side of Jackie we never saw in the tabloids. The little hand-written notes of thanks for a mango ice cream show a gracious person with a sense of humor.<br />The recipes are interesting--Eggs Toupinel is a hollowed-out baked potato refilled with an egg and re-baked. This favorite was served as a lunch for Mrs. Clinton. The information about how food was served and when is also interesting. This is a fascinating peek into the world of a beloved celebrity, and a very fun book to read.	2003-10-30

The Dr. Atkins cookbook certainly fills that bill.<br />I tried the garlic meatballs, putting them on a bed of steamed shaved zucchini to replace noodles, and they were well-received by all. There are some very wonderful appetizers (artichoke hearts in bacon wrap) and generally, these are flavorful recipes that keep the boredom away.

The farmer's daughter is indeed pretty and he paints her in the rustic 1800's farmhouse kitchen. From there, William is smitten, and despite the disappointment of his railroad tycoon father, he marries Ruth.<br />Ruth and William couldn't be more different; he is sophisticated and educated. She is a peasant and is uncomfortable away from the land. But their marriage is bound by a rich physical love that sustains them through their Golden anniversary. And through tragedy.<br />This is a simply-told tale, in the way Buck had of telling the story of people as people, almost divorced from their times. It is not as profound as &quot;The Good Earth&quot; but it has that elemental style that makes for great films and great stories. While this is not Buck at her best, it is a fine tale.	2003-10-30

He visits a monastery nearby and sees a bush considered to be &quot;the burning bush&quot; because of its bright berries. He barges in on famous Egyptologist Zawai Hawass and brandishes Hawass' gilt-lettered card to get into a pyramid.<br />This is a fun travelogue but a bit disappointing in some ways--it drags on and on in some parts.

From the race to the successor of the Enlish throne upon the death of the Princess of Wales, to her reign as an eighteen-year old, her happy marriage and numerous offspring, to the fat and stodgy old Empress who gave her name to an era, this is a view of Victoria we seldom see in history accounts.<br />The best part of the book is about her marriage to Saxe-Coburg Prince Albert, who was &quot;hired&quot; by Victoria as her consort but found himself in love with the diminutive German-English queen. They exchanged paintings (Victoria loved male nudes and was always smitten by male beauty), they read novels and poetry outloud to each other. Victoria handed over a key to the dispatch boxes wherein lay the documents of State, and the unpopular German prince soon was an invaluable right-hand man and man behind the throne.<br />Sadly, Prince Albert died (whether from exhaustion after his successful staging of the Crystal Palace exhibition) or from stomach cancer) and Victoria plunged the Throne into interminable mourning. Afterward, her role in the affairs of state, even with important events such as the Sepoy Rebellion and the Boer War, seemed less intense.<br />The biography focuses on the domestic Victoria, less so on her children, especially the wastrel Edward (Bertie) and strives to keep history as a backdrop to Victoria's life. In this, the biography succeeds admirably, but those interested in English history will want to read other accounts to fill in the events and political intricacies that are only sketched out here.	2003-10-29

Men are notoriously difficult to knit for--they want neutral or dull colors (hard to see when knitting) or those impossibly colorful Australian sweaters favored by Bill Cosby. What should you make your MAN (or even yourself, if you are a man who knits?) Most of the knitting magazines have few men's patterns per issue, so it's nice to have a collection of things that men probably will like.<br />Most of the sweaters are texture-stitch style (Aran knitting, cables) but there are a few simple argyle-banded pullovers, a fine gauge vest or two, and a few boys' models. There is a helpful table to match fitting issues (barrel chests, tall torsos, tapered physique, round shoulders) to the corresponding sweater that will suit the figure. That's a worthwhile feature, as you can apply the ideas to other sweaters you might dream up in future.<br />What you WON'T find here are many colorwork models, nor that shawl-collared jacket so many men like to wear at home and in the yard, nor other popular styles such as Cowichan style thick knits, Icelandic yokes and the most mysterious omission of all--the Mr. Rogers style, complete with zipper. Perhaps the designer Tara Jon Manning doesn't like zippers in knits (I don't either, for that matter; the zipper tape is not as elastic as the knit fabric and that is a nuisance when you sew it in) --but you can hardly offer to knit a sweater for a man and not get a request for a cardigan like the late Fred Rogers pulled on when he stepped into his foyer.<br />If you like texture knitting, and if you want to knit for men and boys, this book is a good choice, especially for the useful fitting guide. If you want colorwork or zippers, you will need another book instead.	2003-10-08

Many knitters request patterns for smaller projects, good for taking on a trip, good for using up leftover yarn, good for a break from sweaters or afghans. While socks are often the choice for small knits (as are hats and mittens), now there's a growing trend to knit useful and ornamental bags.<br />You can let your creativity loose on a bag--somehow people will carry a crazy purse even if they won't wear a funny hat. Vicki Square, author of the bestselling \\"Knitter's Companion\\" has collected 30 interesting bags here for the most jaded of knitters.<br />You could do a standard French Market string bag, or an Irish creel in imitation basketweave stitch. All pretty standard. But what about a Tibetan monk's satchel or a bag shaped like a lucky fish, or an origami-folded bag of linen? And then there are the rich textiles of South and Central America; Inca, Guatemalan, and some really fetching designs from Ecuador that were my personal favorites--diamonds in black and white. Not every design depends on colorwork; some are stunning with the simplest of texture stitches.<br />Many techniques are here--cabling, felting, embroidery, intarsia, applique. The bags are mini-lessons. I recommend this book to knitters who are bored with their usual project and to anyone who is looking for great gift ideas that don't need to be fitted (and it's not too soon to do a few for Christmas.) Even beginners can knit some of these and aspire to the fancier ones as they climb the learning curve. A fun and useful knitting book, indeed.	2003-10-06
974387:US	52500542	RWOPAYLG1EUM2	0974245100	477795767	The Expanding Role of Mass Spectrometry in Biotechnology	Books	5	4	4	N	N	An essential, well-written text for Mass Spec and Biotech	Mass spectroscopy is one of the most useful techniques in biotechnology, especially proteomics. The identification of drug metabolites, synthesis products and protein and protein fragments is a central activity in many types of research projects. Small molecules and larger macromolecules can be analyzed, both for molecular weight and their structure. The popularity of mass spectrometric analysis in biotechnology has soared over the last decade.<br />There have been new developments in mass spec, including hybrid instruments that combine MALDI (Matrix-assisted laser desorption) with ESI electrospray, new ion trap instruments, and many developments such as high-throughput analysis and mass spec for clinical diagnostics. This book serves as both an update to Dr. Siuzdak's first book \\"Mass Spectrometry for Biotechnology\\" and really, serves as a replacement since the original text was published in 1996.<br />The chapters include:<br />1. Ionization and the Mass Spectrometer<br />2. Mass Analyzers<br />3. Practical Aspects of Biomolecular Analysis<br />4. Peptide and Protein Analysis<br />5. Protein Profiling<br />6. Protein Structure characterization<br />7. Nucleic acid, carbohydrates and steroids<br />8. High throughput analysis<br />9. Pharmacokinetics<br />10. Mass Spectrometry in Action (applications)<br />For instructors in analytical chemistry courses at the college or graduate level, the book is a useful text with questions at the end of the chapters to be used as review. These are not in-depth questions, but they are a good tool for the self-directed student to check his or her comprehension. The later chapters are heavy on applications such as carbohydrate and oligonucleotide and steroid analysis, as well as pharmacokinetics. There are many illustrations, well-drawn and clear. This compact, well-written and useful primer should be on the shelf of anyone doing mass spec in biotechnology, anyone studying analytical chemistry or really, anyone in biotechnology.	2003-09-16

When someone says &quot;Linux&quot; do you think of a Charles Schulz character with a security blanket? If that's you, you may profit from Brian Shea's excellent introduction to computer security.<br />Shea uses the same metaphor we use at home to explain security to the novice computer user--a home or a castle, with doors, windows and locks. Viewing security the way you view locking up a house is helpful to visualize the concepts of firewalls.<br />In addition, there is a fine chapter on how to set up your email accounts to avoid spam and how to get rid of spam (not easy, admittedly) coming in existing accounts.<br />Highly recommended for the average computer user.	2003-09-07

The philosophical leanings of Anna Zilboorg, admittedly an unusual person who lives as an Anglican hermit and does handknitting and dyeing as manual labor, form the basis of a book on knitting technique.<br />Whether or not you are a confirmed anarchist, the techniques in the book are interesting. By knitting structures and strips, you can come up with some stunning ideas.<br />This book is illustrated with many photos, and has a lot of conceptual help on the arrangement of knitting stitches along the needle (whether the leg of the stitch is front of the needle or back of it. This determines the twist of the stitch and its orientation after knitting or purling.) As the author promises, if you are the type who can't resist changing a pattern or hates to follow a set of instructions, you will find a lot of interesting new ideas. If you are a lover of well-written, step-by-step patterns, you may not like this book.	2003-09-01

The \\"Somercize\\" diet is low-carb but not no-carb like the Atkins program.<br />The major benefit here is two-fold: Want to reduce refined starches and sugars in your diet? Look no further. The recipes here are mostly low carb and low sugar. You can use saccharine or \\"Somersweet\\" --a mix of fruit fiber and fructose that is still sugar but lower in simple sugars than sucrose or corn syrup. Unfortunately, it's only sold on Suzanne's website, but she does provide the alternative of artificial sweetners. The second benefit is that if you don't care about sweets, you can ignore the desserts and head for the main dishes, which are all thoughtfully created with delicious vegetables, meats and seasonings to please the most discriminating palate.<br />The Somercize diet is a combination of the fad for food-combining; here fat and protein are ok, carbs like vegetables or whole grains are not eaten with fat or protein, and fruits go alone. Some foods are \\"funky foods\\" --that is, a mix of carbs and fat or carbs and proteins, and they are verboten until you lose sufficient weight.<br />Will it work? Possibly. Some people do report great results. But the value here is probably more in the cookbook, which really does have very nice recipes for low sugar, well-prepared meals. And if you do get Somersweet or use saccharine, there are ice cream recipes...so how bad can this be? An attractive book, possibly useful even to Atkins dieters who can navigate those recipes with carbohydrates. And certainly if you are editing sugar out, you won't suffer with this plan.	2003-08-26

I got a e-mail from a professor at Osh University in Uzhbekistan, asking if I'd read &quot;Hostage to the Celestial Turks.&quot;  No, I hadn't read it nor even heard of it or the Bamberg, Germany literary group to which the author belongs. I said I would read and review this book, already intrigued by the title.<br />This novel purports to be the diary of a captive of terrorists, Altaer Magdi, who is a translator. His client, an American trying to research a mysterious religious group The Celestial Turks, disappears. This group seems to hold the long-desired &quot;key to all religions&quot;  with writings that sample from  Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and even Shamanism.<br />The novel is organized in almost an epistolary format, with several points of view--the translator's story and that of the Celestial Turks. There are many stories being told here, in locations ranging from Europe to Central Asia. The reliability of the narrator, or narrators seems questionable, which adds to the sense of mystery. There are passages of great beauty here, but little organization nor a &quot;red thread&quot; for the reader. Hence you have to enjoy this book like bits of various sweetmeats drunk with some strong tea--not a book to be read in a meal but in mouthfuls.<br />This book reminds me greatly of a novella &quot;Seven American Nights&quot; by Gene Wolfe, in which an Iranian journals his possibly drug-influenced seven-day trip to the wastelands of a post-Apocalyptic American before he disappears. I even wonder if there actually was a diary that formed the nucleus of this book, but that is part of the charm as well.	2003-08-13

Reade Scott Whinnem's tale of a magical blue creature (who may or may not be related to the Norse God of Thunder and Applesauce Oton) is absolutely hysterical. Not only are there surprises, the writing itself is piquant and original. And the characters are really characters, not only Utten, but a cast of misfits including a scarecrow, a wolf and a chimpanzee.<br />The book reads a bit like &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; mixed with &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Time Bandits&quot; and a bit of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; swirled in for texture. But &quot;Utten and Plumley&quot; isn't like these books, it's similar only in that it's a classic fantasy.<br />The illustrations (pencil drawings) are entertaining and nicely done. I highly recommend this book for summer student reading, or for any fan of fantasy, young or old.	2003-08-12

You want those designer shoes, the house on the beach, the chick-magnet car, but each rung achieved seems not to satisfy but to provoke greater and more unsatisfying urges.<br />What if...enough were enough? Van Horn takes you on a tour of your inner landscape. What really would make you happy? You might be surprised that it isn't really another object, but a change in lifestyle, leading to a healthier mind, spirit and body.<br />Rather than a dry approach, Van Horn treats this deep subject with humor. There are cartoons and an accompanying CD of the author lecturing, again in a humorous fashion. The outcome maybe financial security and peace in a way you didn't expect.	2003-08-11

Here are some of the projects I found appealing:<br />1. A faux china hutch for a bare kitchen wall. Using moldings from the lumber yard, paint and wallpaper, you can create a hutch-like decoration for the wall and put decorative plates or platters on it, held by plate rails. The wallpaper gives the effect of depth.<br />2. Curtains with a sheer top and panel below. Solves the problem of how to curtain a window with a set of window panes above (like a transom.)<br />3. A swag made with Roman Shade tape to gather it. The designer employs two fabrics and some piping to give the swag some detail and interest.<br />4. A quilt rack on the wall, using a curtain rod and two finials.<br />5. A headboard made of two Euro square pillows and two flanged shams, hanging on a section of curtain rod capped with finials.<br />6. Chair covers with ties, to cover straight-backed chairs or folding chairs.<br />There are a lot more ideas in here, for inside and even the garden. All are do-able with a sewing machine and average sewing skill, and average carpentry skills like nailing, cutting, painting. If you have no table saw to rip 1x6 poplar to 1x4, you can always have the lumberyard do this and other cuts for you.<br />A very excellent book with lots and lots of useful ideas. Highly recommended.	2003-08-09

It was a good thing I had a chance to meet him--otherwise I might think this story was fiction. It's not, though it reads like a novel, maybe  titled &quot;Karate Kid meets Yoda.&quot;<br />Lowry, a country boy living in Springfield, Missouri, went on a youthful quest to find his sensei, his teacher, after hearing rumors that there was a sword master living in town. Unlikely as that was (Springfield is better known for the Ozark Mountains and being near Laura Ingalls Wilder's homestead) it was true. In scenes that follow, Lowry gets training not only from the sensei but from his equally fierce consort. The Japanese couple become a second set of parents and teachers, and they make their indelible mark on David's life.<br />Not only is this an fascinating tale of coming-of-age and two cultures meeting, but it is written with great style. Lowry is a journalist and freelance writer with many, many bylines from top publications. His writing is crisp and visual, and above all, humorous. This is one of my favorite memoirs.	2003-08-08

Newcomers need not apply. You need a track record.) But be that as it may, Peter Rhoades, boy genius, gets the opportunity to head up a biotech genetics firm. The firm gets contracts and grants and has an impressive list of achievments for a decade and a half.<br />Then a mysterious &quot;agency&quot; demands that Rhoade's firm hand over a research project. Is it &quot;national interest&quot;, is this truly a sanctioned agency or are nefarious forces at work? When people start getting hurt, the action speeds up and this thriller picks up the pace.<br />If you like exciting novels that read like adventure-suspense films, Mendel's child is a good choice. It's good casual reading for your summer beachbag or for a couple of rainy, boring winter afternoons.	2003-08-05

Is it due to noxious emissions, pollution and hairspray or is it due to a dastardly plot? No, it's not Dr. Evil or a James Bond nemesis, it's a terroist group tinkering with the weather.<br />The author has a great grasp of scientific theory and facts, as well as computer concepts. Dr. Dowdee uses these ideas effectively to conjure up a fairly good thriller, with a fun concept and fast pace. This is a fine beach read, so pack it in your bag (or store it up for a bad snow day) and shiver in your sandals or slippers as you read a thriller with a unique take on international terrorism.

Some cookbooks are exciting reading but when it comes to actually finding that magre de canard or black-truffle flavored oil, if you live in a rural area or are just pressed for time, your shelves aren't likely to be stocked with such items.<br />Rachel Ray not only uses more down-to-earth and readily available ingredients, she takes no more than 30 minutes to make a fine meal that stands in for a family dinner with kids, a romantic evening at home with your honey or guests dropping by TOMORROW and you can just about make it to the Shop-and-Drop to get provisions in. Her desserts are, for example, often based on vanilla ice cream. But they are not boring and who doesn't like a treat of a good creamy ice cream once in a while?<br />Ray, who comes from New England, a region with a wealth of good sense in cooking, uses healthy things like yogurt, commonly available fruits and veggies, and combines them with intelligence. Is this Haute Cuisine? No, but it is in the tradition of excellence in home cooking and it's pitched to the cook who wants a nice meal with only a modest investment of time and money. Highly recommended.	2003-07-30

If you are one of the millions of people with celiac sprue or other sensitivity to grains, this book will serve you well. The author has a very good understanding of the problems of avoiding wheat and gluten. She lists the commercial ingredients such as modified food starch, hydrolyzed vegetable protein that may be wheat in origin. She tells you how to read labels, and gives advice such as avoiding oatmeal which, though it has no gluten, may be processed in wheat facilities or have been grown with wheat and thus somewhat contaminated. The section on alternative grains like amaranth, quinoa, rice, wild rice, milo and sorghum is comprehensive.<br />The recipes are for everything from pizza, breadsticks, foccacia to cakes, cookies, and other foods. The breadstick recipe tells you how to extrude the breadsticks from a hole in a plastic bag--a novel method easier than rolling dough for those tasty, crunchy snacks. The recipes frequently call for a flour mix recipe included in the book that substitutes for wheat flour. Even bread machines are covered.<br />The book is well-written and an excellent resource for people with wheat and grain dietary restrictions. Highly recommended.	2003-07-16

There is a joke about this: in a small town, there are only two Jews, but there are three synagogues. Why is this so, asks a stranger who is visiting one of the Jewish guys. \\"Well,\\" he answers, \\"There's the synagogue I go to, the one the other guy goes to, and the one NEITHER of us will go to.\\"<br />The CHABAD-Lubavitchers were led until recently by the Rebbe, a charismatic leader who was not replaced upon his death at 92. Yet the Lubavitcher community did not dissolve into disarray, as some predicted would happen. The strength of this community lies in the Schlihim, or missionaries to other Jews. The Schlihim are brilliant at their task; they lead non-observant and modernly-observant Jews back to a more fundamental style of Orthodoxy by example and love, as one would teach a child. They offer comfort and acceptance and a place to worship for all, in contrast to the average temple or synagogue where membership can be prohibitively expensive and seats at the High Holy Days out of reach for those who are of limited means.<br />The Lubavitchers manage to charm Hollywood stars like Jon Voight (not Jewish), visit world leaders, storm uninvited into the Oval Office and generally get what they want with sheer chutzpah (nerve) and a fiddler-on-the-roof belief that G-d will provide.<br />This book is a bit one-sided. While the author remarks that she doesn't like the idea of having to sit behind the curtain that screens women from the men in the orthodox shul, and that she doesn't agree with their interpretation that women cannot be on the beamah (the podium, where the Torah or holy books are read), she presents a uniformly positive view of the Lubavitcher, their large families and dedicated lives. She glosses over the wigs (a custom where married women must cover their hair or shave their heads and wear a wig instead.) She does describe the Mikvah (ritual bath) and provides good insight into its importance to the Orthodox community of women. But the internal conflicts, the struggles that the Lubavitcher must experience are not really dealt with in detail.<br />I enjoyed reading this book, knowing from my own experiences with friends who are ultra-Orthodox that this is not a complete story. But it is a brave story of men and women who start missions with a shoestring and a lot of love for their fellow Jews, and who are rewarded with success for their dedication.the Orthodox community of women.

The story is sort of a farce mixed with fable, about a spoiled California princess, her evil Nemesis Nicky, her boss, a good guy in the frothy world of the dot-com startups in the 90's, and a really bad dude Bill, so bad he is cartoon-funny, like one of the Stooges.<br />The careers of Prez &quot;Bill&quot;, who slickly cons his clients, the career of Michael, who bails out the company when Bill gets canned, are drawn with realism, but lightly so. I worked in some small startup firms, and there is a real element of truth in all this, even when Iceman is at his most outrageous.<br />The funniest sections are about Bill's escapades, each one more unbelievable than the next. Bill's cons are bound to backfire, and it's wonderful how Iceman rachets them up a notch each time, so that at the end, you believe it's a pickle Bill really could have gotten himself into.<br />If you want some light summer reading, and if you are somewhat interested in start-up corporate life in California, this will tickle your funnybone. I thought it was a hoot--well done, Aaron Iceman, you're a born storyteller.	2003-06-26

This is a journal-like book outlining the steps Lighthart took during her therapy to deal with MPD, a result of childhood trauma.<br />The most interesting part of the book is Lighthart's description about how the multiple identities (\\"alters\\") emerged. They were not all living in her, fully formed with her swapping people in and out through some kind of mental revolving door. Instead, she gives a very different view of discovering how these \\"alters\\" function, one taking tests, another drawing and painting, another emerging as a healer (\\"Turtle\\"), the part seeking health and unity. Some of the alters seem to solidify into discrete entities only when analyzed. It's not exactly like you see in movies. And this would probably be of great help to someone going through therapy for this disorder, or doing therapy for other childhood trauma or post-stress difficulties. This is a good read for a clinical psychology student or a patient.	2003-06-21

Kephart writes a thrilling saga that should please the most discriminating of fantasy afficionados. &quot;Lord Brother&quot; is much better, more exciting and more interesting than its predecessor &quot;Wysard.&quot;<br />You should read &quot;Wysard&quot; first for the background of Ryel's society and his history, starting with the loss of his mentor Edris. In &quot;Lord Brother&quot;, Ryel continues his quest to bring Edris back to life, joins a bloody brotherhood, is befriended by the delightful Markess Gwynedd and suffers great pains along the way.<br />There is a lot of adventure here, and very fine imagery. I only wish the print were not as fine in this book--the typeface was for my eyes a bit difficult....but for the average reader of fantasy (younger than I!) it should pose no problem at all.	2003-06-09

She is treated with incredible brutality, her life is discounted to the level of dumpster garbage. But Connie is far from insane--despite the fact she finds out she can time-travel.<br />Connie visits Massapoisset, Massachusetts in the future via a kind of mental holographic sending-receiving abilities of a local resident there, Luciente. Life in the future is idyllic, though not perfect, and Connie develops relationships with people in the Cape Cod village. But life in the mental ward becomes increasingly dangerous. Connie has to make some difficult choices to survive.<br />What I like best about this novel, in addition to the style which is nearly perfect, is that there are levels to the story. If you look at the events in one light, you could come to an entirely different conclusion about Connie's sanity.<br />I absolutely recommend you read this book--and I am putting it on my \\"100 best American Novels\\" list. If you like Margaret Atwood (\\"Handmaid's Tale) you be likely enjoy \\"Woman on the Edge of Time.\\" HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2003-05-30

Yet I like some authors who cross over into fantasy from sci-fi like Ursula LeGuin, Anne McCaffrey and Sherri Tepper.<br />Carolyn Kephart's &quot;Wysard&quot; starts out a bit like &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; Ryel is highly gifted with magical ability, has a scar from a lightning bolt, leaves home and goes off to study with Master Edris. Here's where the similarity ends. &quot;Wysard&quot; is for teens and adults, not for kids. There's none of the whimsical Potter humor here. &quot;Wysard&quot; is PURE fantasy.<br />The strained relationship with Ryel with his mentor Edris, Ryel's subsequent quest and conflict in his role in the magical city-state of Markul are compelling. The struggles are heroic. There is a lot of action and good character development. My only criticism is that the scenes move back and forth between the mature Ryel and the youth Ryel and sometimes the transition is not smooth, so you have to pay attention.<br />I was surprised how much I enjoyed this novel. If you are a fan of fantasy like the Earthsea books of LeGuin, you will definitely enjoy &quot;Wysard.&quot;	2003-05-27

The book is laced with famous and not-so-famous names. In fact, if you are a radio buff, this book is for you, because Johnny met nearly everyone and his memory for who's who is sharp and detailed.<br />If you love radio or are a fan of Johnny, you will enjoy this book--a slice of radio as it was in its heyday.	2003-05-24

Stewart '26 Series)	Books	5	28	28	N	N	Fascinating view of life in Siberia	Sharon Hudgins and her husband took teaching jobs in Irkutsk and Vladivostok, two major cities in Siberia. They had to adjust to life in post-Soviet Russia, a far cry from the way things were at the University of Maryland, where they held teaching positions.<br />Hudgins is a food and travel writer, so there is much detail about the food, cooking and grocery supplies in Russia. In fact, several chapters seemed pretty much one party after another with the hospitable Russians, who love a get-together with good food and drink, and party hard all night. It's a good way to ignore the intermittant electricity, lack of running water and other infrastructure problems that plague the crumbling post-Soviet urban landscape.<br />The most interesting part of the book was a stint in Ulan-Ude, capital of the Buryat Republic. The Buryat are a Mongolian people, cousins of the Mongol Horde of Genghis Khan. The only Tibetan lamasery (monastery) is in Ulan-Ude. The Buryat Republic borders Lake Baikal, the deepest, oldest lake in the world, home to unique species of flora and fauna and a fascinating place to read about.<br />This is a fascinating travel book, with a lot of fun anecdotes and stories about horrific train rides, scary food (a sheep's head with the wool still on it, and blood pudding in a sheep's stomach, no way to say &quot;no thank you&quot; to the amiable hosts who are putting on a real spread for their guests.) If you are interested in Russia, in a part of Russia most Westerners never visit, you should read &quot;The Other Side of Russia.&quot;	2003-05-17

It's the memoir of Ron Arias, a staff correspondent for People Magazine. It starts out as a biography of Arias' parents. His father, Armando, is being held as a POW in Korea. His mother holds the family together until Armando's return. But this happy event is soon overshadowed by many troubles; Armando is being discredited by the Army, his promotion to captain is delayed (is it because he's Hispanic?) And he's a changed man, brooding, a strict disciplinarian but now with an edge since his return from near-starvation and survival of a Korean POW camp. Ron and his brothers find the household tense and troubling after Armando returns.<br />And there are more mysteries. Why does Ron's mother refuse to take communion at Sunday Mass? There is truth to be uncovered here, and Arias takes us on a young man's journey to find himself and his family.<br />The memoir also shows us Arias' development as a writer, from a chance encounter with Hemingway in Pamplona, to a course in English literature in Argentina from a Professor Borges (yes, Jorge Luis Borges.) And in Argentina, Ron begins a career as a journalist. We follow Ron through a stint in Peru as a Peace Corps volunteer and watch how a young and talented journalist develops. But the story of his family and his identity is an equally compelling thread.<br />This is probably one of the best memoirs I've read in years. The writing is crisp, the description of everyday details sharp and focused. Arias has the ability to go back and look out of the eyes of innocence and ignorance-we follow him along in the book as if we all were sent back in time in his life.  If you liked \\"The Color of Water\\" or \\"Angela's Ashes\\" this book will resonate with you. You really should read it. I promise you won't be disappointed.	2003-05-16

The book is something that would be useful for families of people who are widowed--so many times the surviving partner of a marriage reports that after the initial sympathy outflow, they are ultimately ignored. Plus how do you talk to someone about their loss and the person they lost.<br />This isn't so much a practical book about picking up the day-to-day pieces as it is about navigating the emotional tide. A good guide.	2003-05-15

There are a lot of books on harmonica method, and they range from too simple to too complicated.<br />This book is surprisingly good. It covers what harmonicas to purchase (and the advice is good, the listing of brands fairly complete.) There is a section on bending notes, an essential technique for getting more notes out of a diatonic harmonica and for creating a bluesy sound.<br />The best chapter, for me, was on the structure of 12-bar blues with an explanation of the &quot;call-and-response&quot; structure. It's easy to understand and essential for structuring your blues riffs to make musical sense. There's also a fine chapter on the etiquette of jamming with harmonica when you join up with a guitarist, singer and other instrumentalists. The harmonica plays support, mostly, but does get to solo. When should you chime in and when do you fade to the background? This chapter tells you how not to make a fool of yourself.<br />The only thing this book doesn't have is a CD with guitar or piano for jamming along with. If you are getting started in harmonica, especially blues harp, you will need some CD's, especially of the greats like Little Walter and Charles Musselwhite, to provide examples. You can't listen enough to get the ideas down. But this book is a really worthy text to go along with your practice.	2003-05-12

His sense of self, however, was a mixture of deep introspection and a measure of self-loathing. His spiritual seeking led him to a short stay with Trappist monks in Kentucky. As a result, he gave up his worldly career and embarked on a journey of spiritual seeking as a brother at the monastery.<br /><br />Merton loved music, women, good food, yet he also had a yearning to be free of the world. He describes the ascetic diet at the abbey--meat is forbidden, even fish not eaten, and the monks do heavy agricultural work on bread, vegetables, cheese, and in the evening, maybe a small dish of applesauce. Despite the hardships, Merton finds that becoming a priest is the most meaningful thing ever to happen to him. This book is his memoir of becoming a priest and his spiritual climb from a self-indulgent youth to a mature man continually on the search for spiritual peace and enlightenment. Thus the title \\"seven storey mountain\\" aptly taken from the mountain of Purgatory in Dante's Divine Comedy--a place of punishment, though temporary, on the way to Heaven.<br /><br />Merton's writing made him so famous he sought a hermitage at the abbey. He never seemed quite comfortable anywhere. His sense of discomfort with himself and his exquisite sensibility to spiritual heights make for fascinating reading.	2003-05-12

The analysis section of Morgenstern's book stuck with me and it's why I like this book; why aren't you organized? Space issues? Perfectionist-fear-of-failure? Or is your system too organized and is it just impossible to maintain? After you go through this part of the book, the rest is common sense, but it does provide A PLAN, and a plan is key to getting anything done.<br />The plan is more or less:<br />1. Sort<br />2. Purge<br />3. Assign a home<br />4. Containerize<br />5. Equalize<br />Many other organization books have exactly the same steps. But the difference here is in knowing what failed you before you start out, and the idea of finding things you might need (an extra clothes rod in your closet, crates for files you aren't using but want to store, etc) before you embark on the clean-up. If you have a really hard time divesting yourself of &quot;stuff&quot;, you might need another book on how to get out of the clutter habit, but this one is a good start.	2003-05-09

In the age of cigarette-smoking, diet-drink swilling models who look at each bite of food as if it were arsenic-laden, she is a testament to healthy appetites. But is her food more than a posh fad of public television?<br />Mmmm, yes, this lady can cook. I would keep this book just for the mustard coated salmon. Many of the recipes are Mediterranean inspired (simple mussels in wine sauce) but she strays wickedly from Europe into the Orient with cold soba noodles, a real favorite of mine.<br />She does rely for some of the desserts on marscapone (rich Italian cream cheese) which has to be trekked in from the Italian Market in Philadelphia by caravan and only ends up on my hips, so why bother? Some of the other rare ingredients are hard for me, in semi-rural Delaware to come by as well. (rosewater, fresh figs, better add these to the caravan order.) We do have great fish here in the Chesapeake, but even if you are in landlocked Iowa, there is a lot of good stuff here for summer entertaining and for tempting you to eat healthy, interesting things in the hot months. Her use of vegetables (yellow squash soup, carrot salad, beets) is original and wonderful. High time we had a new set of creative veggie recipes and here they are.<br />By the way, the mustard coating works well on bluefish, though one is not supposed to eat a lot of bluefish. But fishing for these little fighters is so much fun. If you eat a blue now and then, try the salmon recipe out on them, too.	2003-05-05

Manners count for Ron Clark's students	Ron Clark teaches school. He has 55 rules of \\"engagement\\" for anything from good manners (Don't take the largest piece of pie, Always say Thank-You, Make Eye Contact) to rules of responsibility and deportment (Enter the field trip building silently, Do not talk in the movies, unwrap your candy before the film to keep from disturbing others.)<br />These rules teach his students to be polite and attentive, to understand if they don't hand in assignments, there will be consequences (even if the assignment is just a little blue card they have to return to him the next day.) But Ron is no martinet--he has weird rules (No Doritos, just because...and a funny story to make the rule amusing.) His War of the Onions against a sadly jealous fellow teacher is both hysterically funny and touching.<br />Ron Clark shows the world that kids anywhere can learn to be well-brought up and polite, that manners and rules help them succeed. He makes the very important point that a teacher is an important influence since he or she is with those kids for more time during the day than the parents.<br />This book is fun to read and is a great story. It is also a MUST-READ for any school teacher who wants to excel with their students and give them something of tremendous value to carry them through the rest of their lives with honor and grace--good manners and good behavior.<br />Bravo, Ron Clark!	2003-04-25

The CD that accompanies this book is, that's right, one track. Yet the sections are really discreet lessons. That's annoying; I have to zip on search past the beginning every time I start and stop this CD.<br />The book has some useful stuff and it does have music notation mixed with the usual draw-blow notation used for harmonica. And the section on bending notes is excellent--it has practice riffs that test your ability to bend the note down halves and whole notes. There is even a one-hole three-note bent riff. Nice to learn. And the theory is better explained than in some books plus the written-out musical notation blues songs are great.<br />There are some useful tricks in here, so you have to forgive the silly idea of a one track cd. The sections are played quickly, so if you want to play along or listen again, you have to restart the CD. Maybe you can create an audio cassette tape cut into sections and cued for reference by lesson. I might try that, as I found a lot of merit in this book and CD package.	2003-04-21

I particularly liked the Grilled Chicken Citrus Salad (because I love the combination of chicken and citrus in salads and grilling adds that gourmet touch) and I also liked the lower fat muffins and stews.<br />I don't feel I am making substitute diet food in the least, and I can even serve it to company. Now, that's a cookbook that is really useful! Just one caveat: you MUST watch your portion sizes.

We had World War II's Stalin as a model of Big Brother, complete with moustache.<br />Yet, now that it is 2003 and way past 1984, it's apparent that author Huxley was incredibly prescient. He set a tragedy modeled on Shakespeare (Othello mixed with elements of The Tempest--hence the title \\"Brave New World\\". ) It's set in a futuristic state where babies are cloned and grown extra-utero in glass jars. A happy state of drugged complacence (Prozac?) is the norm. Sex is free of emotional ties, in fact, promiscuity and gratuitous sex are required by law! Entertainment is mindless (Disco? Survivor? Joe Millionaire?) and real literature and art are subversive.<br />This book is a must-read and it will change how you view our cultural.

Their story is set against the backdrop of the Counter-Reformation and some unsettled times in European history, not to mention the development of major ideas of cosmology.<br />But what's equally interesting are the life and times of these two scientists in the context of 17th Century daily life. Ferguson researches her subject and provides the reader with a story that is a cross between a soap opera and a historical fiction novel. Brahe's castle and observatory were not only architecturally interesting, the life inside the walls was fraught with nasty doings. Brahe, by all reports, had quite the temper. He may have even invented the modern day graduate student-slavey; he kept associates of lower social rank under his thumb for years, paid them a pittance, assigned them menial work, stole their intellectual property and literally imprisoned them in his palace.<br />If you have an interest in astronomy or philosophy or just plain European history from this era, you should read this. I couldn't put it down. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-04-12

These two plays &quot;Flight&quot; and &quot;Bliss&quot; show Bulgakov's real forte--drama. He authored plays (not published in his lifetime) and worked as a stage director (an assistant director, all he was allowed by the Soviet government, who knew him for an independent thinker.)<br />Both plays are very readable, despite the workaday translations. Bulgakov's flights of fancy and sarcasm (a future world without crime, for example) are comic yet scary.  If you want to really get to know Bulgakov's work, these plays, plus &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot;. &quot;White Guard&quot; and &quot;Master and Margarita&quot; make a good starting collection of his best works.	2003-04-09

While Starmore deals with Fair Isle style knitting only, the techniques are useful for all kinds of knitting design.<br />In addition to the history of Fair Isle knitting, Starmore explains the use of OXO patterns mixed with &quot;peerie&quot; or bands of small patterns that are mixed with the larger patterns and provide a pleasing rhythm to the design. The fact that only two colors are used per row is hard to believe when you look at how Starmore mixes subtle color changes to yield some amazing results. She also shows the inspiration for the colorways, from a handful of wet sea pebbles, to a moor landscape, to a flea market display of bric-a-brac. You can find colorways all around you once you get an eye for how Starmore looks at the world.<br />The book has useful charts for OXO and peerie patterns and a section on how to construct classic pullovers, vests and cardigans. This is one of my most favorite knitting books.	2003-04-08

It's worth the effort.<br />Though not as musically complex as Mozart, the Haydn Sonatas require good clean technique and attendance to dynamics and tempo. This edition has no fingering; good if you disagree with anyone else's rendering but bad if you need a starting point to either follow or reject.<br />If you aren't sure if these are worth your time, go listen to Andre Watts or Andreas Schiff play a few of these and I am sure you will be back. While not profound like Beethoven or soaringly beautiful like Mozart, these gems shimmer like little diamonds and are a good way to improve your pianistic skills. And they are always easy on the ear.	2003-04-08

Back in print, an essential knitting history	There have been a number of knitting history books but Bishop Rutt's History of Hand Knitting is perhaps the most readable. This new edition by Interweave Press has a lot to offer anyone interested in textiles and knitting. From nalbinding (a Scandinavian netting technique) to to the flourishing of knitting as a guild in the Middle Ages, and later the development of silk handknit stocking that replaced cloth leggings in Elizabethan times, the history of knitting is a fascinating story of craft combined with economics. This is one of my favorite knitting history books and I am pleased it is back in print.	2003-04-08

Although I don't like every one of them, several of her books are among my favorite novels. I really admire her explorations into the &quot;otherness&quot; of  gender, which was the primary theme in her greatest novel &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness.&quot; In &quot;The Birthday of the World&quot;, Le Guin revisits Karhide (where &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot; took place) and plays with the idea of complex marriages, unbalanced societies, and the loss of innocence, all themes she has touched on throughout her writing career.<br />If you are new to Le Guin, I'd recommend you read one of her great novels first (&quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, &quot;The Dispossessed) Then, these stories should flesh out an appreciation for her work. If you are working on writing your own science fiction or speculative fiction, I'd highly recommend this book of short stories along with &quot;Steering the Craft&quot;, her writing workshop handbook. These two volumes really should be packaged together for fiction writers.	2003-04-08

It is dense with symbolism, history, philosophy and digressions into frank editorializing by the author, who interjects his voice into the story in a disconcerting way.<br /><br />The philosophical ramblings of \\"The Magic Mountain\\" are similar--the Dionysian Weltanschaung of the Jesuit (Naphta) and The Voluptuary (Peeperkorn) versus the Apollonian (Settembrini) are used as metaphors for a debauched and dying Old Europe versus the New Europe to be reborn after the convulsions of World War I. And they are also symbolic of the failure of \\"pure reason\\" and politically correct Art to save a society with no soul, where human lives are scored on a worth-scale and have no intrinsic value as endowed by their Creator.  In \\"Dr. Faustus\\", Mann revisits the German split personality (order versus bloody chaos) and makes it more intimate; he desperately wants to unearth what is it about the German Soul that gave us both World War I and then its offspring World War II and Hitler.  Mann spends the rest of the book examining the German soul in the character of Adrian Leverkuehn and the forces influencing his life.<br /><br />This is a brilliant book in that it takes the favorite Faust theme so loved by the Germans and re-tells it in a compelling fashion. Where the reader will have difficulty is that they will miss many of the character names that are sly jokes (if you are not a German speaker), and in following Mann's dense prose, followed by digressions into his own musings. And then you need to be somewhat familiar with European history and cultural icons.<br /><br />Leverkuehn sells his soul to the Devil for the ability to compose the world's most perfect musical work. Here is the meeting of Apollo and Dionysus; the music is modeled on Schoenberg's astringent 12 tone scale of systematic composition based on his constructed rules of music; the Devil seeks Chaos and destruction of God's creation and Man's immortal soul. Leverkuehn gets his wish from the Devil; he creates his immortal music, but he loses the most human of abilities; that to love and be loved. As he tries to escape the deal he made, he is struck down and the objects of his love are similarly destroyed. The devices Mann employs --a stroke following a bout of venereal disease, are realistic and are incredibly clever; these things COULD happen to a man in real life, though we are reading a fable about selling one's soul to a Devil made into an actual character. One of Mann's very early short stories (The Wardrobe) employs this same duality in storytelling; a sick man takes a train ride. Does he arrive at his destination, does he stop at a hotel where he meets a mysterious woman in his wardrobe, or does he die in transit? What is reality and what is fable here?<br /><br />On its own merits, \\"Dr. Faustus\\" is not Mann's best book but it is perhaps his most personal. The author is telling a story to the willing reader as if he were almost reading it aloud, and taking asides to discourse on his deepest feelings as an exile from his homeland. If you are a Thomas Mann fan, it's worth reading after \\"Magic Mountain\\" prepares you for Mann's characteristic style and themes.tal soul.

If you have a closet full of bags with knitted pieces and you are stumped as to the steps to get to a SWEATER, this book can help.<br /><br />I have a simple pamphlet about knitting finishing which has been my standby for years. But this book is much nicer, as it has a lot of color illustrations that really show how the finish should look. The photography and choice of yarn colors lets you see clearly how to pick up stitches for a band, how the sewing should look, how to insert a zipper. The spiral binding is hand for laying down flat as you work a finish as a swatch or for real on your sweater. The book is small enough to fit in a normal tote bag, but not so small as to be hard to read.<br /><br />If someone is a knitter in your family, this would make a good gift--even though I've been knitting for years, this is a very handy thing to pop into the knitting bag and carry along. I really like it.	2003-03-26

When his books were censored, he wrote a wild, heartfelt letter to authorities in Soviet Russia, asking that, if they were not to be allowed to publish his work, would they then assign him to work in theater, even as a lowly stagehand. In one of Stalin's capricious moves, Bulgakov was, indeed, assigned to work as an assistant director at a Moscow theater.<br />Meanwhile, Bulgakov continued to amass what must be one of the world's great hordes of literary work unpublished in the lifetime of an author. &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; is probably his most viciously anti-Soviet, anti-Proletariat work, and it reads like a cross between Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; but with Bulgakov's intense sarcasm and humor thrown in. The book is so dramatic, it's almost impossible to read it without seeing it run like a film or play behind your eyes as you read it.<br />A professor (whose Russian name is a play on the scientist Pavlov) adopts a mongrel dog. The dog Sharik (Fido, Rover...) is grateful! His life on the street has been hard, he's been kicked, scalded with hot water and he is starving. The professor feeds him well. Ah, he's gaining weight and healing up. What a nice man! A god, even, well, to a dog. But wait a minute!  The professor, noted surgeon that he is, is preparing to operate. He seizes the dog....<br />And then we see the results of the professor's cruel experiment. A dog gets a human brain portion and begins to develop as a human. But he isn't a nice friendly, tail-wagging human. Oh, no. He's low, a cur, yes, a dog of a man who chases cats uncontrollably, pinches women's bottoms and drinks like a fish (oops mixed metaphor there.) He demands to be registered and get papers like a human being in Soviet society. And the authorities are anxious, even rabid to assist him. Sharikov takes a first name and patronymic that is so inappropriate, so hysterically funny that you have to laugh out loud. Then he gets a prominent job as a purge director, eliminating those counter-revolutionary cats from Moscow's pure Communist society. That is, until the professor cooks up a plot.<br />This is a gem of a book. Bulgakov shares Orwell's deep hatred of totalitarianism, but unlike the delicate satire of Orwell, Bulgakov writes with massive belly laughs of deeply sarcastic humor and over-the-top jokes. He's a dramatist at heart, and this book shows his theatrical thinking, where exaggerated movement and stage props play as much a role in exposition as dialog.<br />This is a true small masterpiece and should appeal to just about anyone. It would be a very good book for a high school or college literature study.  It is really wonderful, and prepares the reader for Bulgakov's wildly out of control masterpiece &quot;Master and Margarita.&quot; Don't miss this book for anything!nd patronymic that is so inappropriate, so hysterically funny that you have to laugh out loud.

So how many MORE mitten books do we need--being as we all wear far few mittens than, say, socks?<br />I was not, therefore, immediately interested in this book. But, wait, who are the Komi people and what kind of knitting do they do? it turns out the Komi are a Finno-Ugric group who are ethnically related to the Estonians and Finns. Like the Baltic Estonians, they use the angular, diagonal patterns found in Estonia and Latvia, as well as in Lithuania and parts of Russia. The mittens here are colorful, with eye-catching use of all-over designs and mixed &quot;septentary&quot; smaller bands that make for very attractive hand coverings.<br />But not only mittens--author Schurch includes a lovely pattern for long stockings which could be used for cross-country skiing, and two very nice hats--a Komi fez with tassels and a sort of stocking cap.<br />If you like color pattern knitting, this book is a valuable idea resource. If you like knitting mittens, of course you will like it even better. But even if hats and socks are really your favorites, (they are for me) this book has a great deal to offer in novel patterns and colorways. I like it a lot.	2003-02-10

I loved Oberle's \\"Folk Shawls\\" and I was even more impressed with \\"Folk Vests.\\"  Her first volume \\"Folk Shawls\\" had patterns for traditional shawls and stoles based on ethnic designs from around the world. In \\"Folk Vests\\" not only are the vest shapes re-created, but the textiles of the various lands are cleverly worked out.<br />In particular, the Japanese vests look like Ikat dyed handloomed cotton, both a single direction dyed ikat and a double-dyed check pattern (Kasuri) in the traditional indigo color. The random striped vest versions could also be knit in handpainted wool--a nice use for this popular technique of dyeing.<br />The shape of many of the vests uses the same construction as would be used with woven cloth. Some of the vests have a long version, which is a good thing because most of the vests are short. This is a problem if you are short-waisted or thick on top, as short vests are not as flattering a shape.<br />There are other wonderful patterns that take a twist on the traditional. The Tyrolean twisted stitch vest is similar to those knit garments found in the Alpine regions of Austria and Germany but Oberle incorporates a stocking \\"clock\\" pattern on the vest back that makes an interesting \\"v\\"--not just a replica of Tyrolean style knitting but a clever play.<br />There are several fairisle vests that are of interest to handspinners. One is done in sheep's colors (cream, gray, brown and black) and could be knit of handspun undyed colored wool. Another recalls the use of lichen dye from parmellia which gives golden tones. While the vest pattern is knit from commercially available Shetland yarn, you could, as a spinner and dyer, make your own genuine lichen dye or onion skin dyed yarn to knit this vest. The Prince of Wales' famous fairisle is also here, with a note that the colors of the vest in the portrait of the Prince were probably not those on the actual vest. My favorites, however, are an African vest in a mudcloth-like black and white pattern, and a Peruvian llama vest with a gorgeous patterned band on a rich brown plain knit vest.<br />As in \\"Folk Shawls\\" there is a also a plain black model and notes on how to modify the various models. And husband Gary Oberle contributes his attractive linocuts to ornament each chapter.<br />A lovely book.

She was at a ripe old age and had a full life, and the way she tied up the loose ends of her life, lovingly and with great passion and determination, was inspiring. This is like \\"Chicken Soup for the Knitting Soul.\\"<br />If you like to read about people who knit and about their real-life experiences and deep feelings, this book is for you.

They reheat well after a long day at the office and they are soothing to the throat, very filling but lighter fare. It suits us for an evening meal when we really don't want something heavy but do want something hot. Since we've traveled extensively in Asia and love the cuisine, this book was one we just had to try. I am glad to report that \\"Asian Soups, Stews and Curries\\" is a wonderful book for the Asian cuisine lover.<br />The first recipe we tried was Kalbi Tang, Korean Short Rib Soup. This is a famous Korean dish, almost as famous as Bulgogi and Kimchee. The instructions were interesting; in order to achieve the beautiful clear broth in which the meat and onions float, you must soak the ribs overnight, or boil them and discard that water to remove the scum (which is the albumin and meat bits that coagulate when you boil meat.) I followed this direction, and the other stipulation to remove ALL visible fat from the ribs. After then making the stock and refrigerating the soup overnight to remove the rest of the fat, I made the ginger, sesame and soy sauce-based seasoning that flavors the soup. Wow! What a taste--rich, yet with a clear, flavorful broth. This was an enormous hit at our house.<br />After watching my husband practically stick his whole head into the Korean soup pot, I decided there must be more good stuff in here. The next one we want to try is Cambodian Fish Soup with Pineapple and Tomatoes--pineapple is surprisingly good in curry type clear soups.<br />Just about everything is in here from Japanese Chanko-nabe (Sumo Wrestler's fatten-up stew) to Mulligatawny. There are quite a few lentil based curries (nice, we love lentils), noodle soups, meat soups, fish, vegetable and rice soups and stews. This is a fascinating book and one with some very nice and unusual recipes, good for light evening one-pot meals or fancy entertaining or pot-luck. This is fast becoming one of my favorite cookbooks.	2003-02-01

After much hemming (!) and hawing, they decided to concentrate on sewing only. This was a loss to knitters but the Threads publishers have collected the articles into a series of books. Thanks, Taunton Press!<br />This particular volume has articles on techniques such as strip-knitting, which is back in vogue right now. You make a garment in a series of knitted-together strips that form the shape of the garment by varying their lengths. Each strip can be a different pattern or offset patterns and lends a very nice ethnic look (think mudcloth or other handcrafted textiles.)<br />There are articles about design techniques such as symmetry, texture stitches with colorwork, some lace and a few intarsia things that look a lot like Kaffe Fasset style knitting. Mostly this book is ABOUT the design and not about the patterns, so if you like to design this is for you. If you are looking for a book of models to knit from patterns, you might be disappointed.	2003-01-31

Until Amazon's book listing system separates the two different books out by version, this review, which is 10 years old, will not be entirely relevant to the new book. There are few pictures of the new models. My guess it is because the author is known for keeping very tight control on her intellectual property (the designs) and doesn't want them copied or reverse-engineered. Want to see all of them? You have to order the new book. But I list the changes from the original edition:<br />Patterns with same styling, colorways, but fit may be different than the original 1998:<br />Anne of Cleves<br />Elizabeth the first<br />Katherine of Aragon<br />Catherine Parr<br />Katherine Howard<br />Mary Tudor<br />Margaret Tudor<br /><br />Same name, but different appearance:<br />Elizabeth of York<br />Jane Seymour<br />Anne Boleyn<br /><br />Completely New Patterns to the New Edition:<br />Margaret Beaufort<br />Elizabeth Woodville<br />Mary, Queen of Scots<br />Lady Mary<br />------------------<br /><br />The Tudor kings and queens had sumptuous clothing down to an art--gold embroidery, padding, slits, velvet, silks, jewels, lace. They had it all--and they wore it all at the same time. (They apparently did NOT have the fashion rule to look in the mirror and take ONE ornament away to avoid overdressing. No indeed. Their rule seemed to be to look in the mirror and make sure to add ONE MORE THING. Was there any other time in history when costume was so frankly over-the-top? I don't believe so.)<br /><br />Alice Starmore and her apprentice, daughter Jade, created a number of sweater designs inspired by the Tudor royals. These are not recreations of Tudor clothing. Instead, these are wearable art that give an impression of richness. Of the designs, one of the most stunning is \\"Katherine Howard\\" done by Jade Starmore. She is especially good at dramatic shaping in knitwear--her trademark. The design is in \\"gold\\" and \\"silver\\" color wool that looks like metallic embroidery couching over a carnelian colored ground. While done in plain, matte wool colors, the impression of this sweater is of a richly embroidered coat with a peplum.<br /><br />The \\"Margaret Tudor\\" is interesting in that it features textured knitting depicting thistles, with pewter buttons studding the cables to give the effect of jewelry. Wearable, but dramatic.<br /><br />There is also a lot of colorwork done with Starmore's unique way to blend many, many subtle shades of yarn that creates a pearly effect. This is especially effective in the \\"Henry VIII\\" which uses golds and browns on a blue ground. The blended shades look like gold embroidery. Amazing.<br /><br />The most interesting choice of design was the \\"Elizabeth I\\", which is NOT pounds of textured yarns and buttons like a heavily-jeweled tunic, but instead, virginal WHITE with a textured neck pattern taken from silk stockings. The shaping is that of a stomacher (lower in front, slanting down over the tummy.) It is a testament to the \\"Virgin Queen\\" image of Elizabeth while quoting amusingly from the famous design of the silk stockings she made popular. Think Glynis Paltrow or Cate Blanchett. If you have a pretty figure, this would look stunning.<br />___________________<br /><br />CHANGES in NEW REVISED EDITION published in November 2013.

Alice Starmore is a knit designer who is reknown for her colorwork (Fairisle type--she hails from Lerwick, Scotland) and for her textured Aran and Guernsey-style work. Here she creates some glorious textured sweaters in chapters named after lands where fisherfolk live, work and yes, knit their characteristic designs. The chapters include:<br />1. Scotland<br />2. England<br />3. Ireland (including the Aran Isles)<br />4. Points North, South and East (including Breton, Norway and the Baltic lands and the Faroes)<br />5. The New World (hey, that's US!! Nova Scotia, Cape Cod, and more.)<br />The sweaters range from the thickly cabled true Aran style (the gorgeous Innishmore is incredibly deep and intricate) to colorwork such as a combination of textures and pattern characteristic of Estonian knitting. There is also an adorable child's sweater modeled after a Breton sailor's striped jersey.<br />This is one of Starmore's most useful books. The sweaters could be worn by men, children, fashionable women, hikers, you name it. If you love TEXTURE, you will adore this, but there is also color.  In addition to the designs I just mentioned, I love the charming \\"Nova Scotia\\" featuring scallop shells in a knit-purl design.<br />This is one of my favorite Starmore books.	2003-01-31

There are many reasons to read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" --<br />1. It is a great American classic novel<br />2. It documents a period in history from the common-man's viewpoint.<br />3. It is banned by some libraries and schools (a must-read, therefore on my list always!)<br />4. It can teach you to write.<br />5. It's a great adventure story that can be read aloud to groups, or enjoyed by yourself!<br />The Fischer et al. edition attempts to reconstruct \\"Huck Finn\\" in the way Twain probably intended. In particular, there is a section showing how Twain revised the \\"Sunrise on the River\\" passage to perfectly reproduce the sound of English as spoken by Huck --so reading this is almost as if we are listening to a tape recording of Huck talking. If you are unsure about \\"Huck Finn\\", turn to the Sunrise passage and read it aloud. Then tell me you AREN'T an admirer of this novel.<br />As a lesson for writers, Twain's search to perfect his craft and reproduce the very sound of his characters, along with a splendid use of language and an ability to create adventuresome plot are unparalleled in American literature. Banned? Are you people NUTS? This is possibly one of the greatest American books ever written.<br />A MUST-READ if you love American literature, or really English language literature in general.	2003-01-29

I'm re-reading this again (2014) and immediately, I was pulled into the story and it's as vivid as watching a film. The scenes on board the \\"Thetis\\" trying to double Cape Horm in the face of building-high waves practically made me seasick. The landing on Hawaii and the scene where the missionaries meet Queen or Alii Nui Malama, a 6'4\\", 350lb woman whose very size is a sign of her royalty is like no other I can think of in a novel. And it just gets better. The beginning of the book, as is Michener's custom, starts with an ancient and natural history of the islands themselves.<br /><br /> The genre of blockbuster historical novels can seem somewhat dated (viz. the mammoth novels of Mitchell, Ferber, McCullough, Caldwell and Follett) but they are definitely delicious if you get a taste for them. Dated or not, Hawaii is a gripping tale of not-so-angelic missionaries, struggling immigrants and early Polynesian settlers. The characters are absolutely unforgettable. Some of them are detestable. But that adds to the drama--strong emotion gets you so involved.<br /><br />My favorite section of the book is still the story of the missionaries running headlong against the traditions of the Polynesian people, whether insisting they wear confining clothing in the tropical heat, or that they should quit their practical tradition of dancing, swimming and surfing in the buff.  The missionaries stubbornly eat dried apples shipped to them across the sea, and scorn the richly nutritious native fruits and vegetables unfamiliar to them. They wilt in their long underwear, donned by the season. They try hard to bring a  foreign world to their religion in the belief it will benefit the people, but when two vastly different cultures clash, it is inevitably tragic. Michener writes about this clash in vivid, sometimes shocking detail.<br /><br />This book has been filmed, has even used as a basis for a musical but nothing compares to reading the original. I couldn't put it down. And re-reading it, it's the same thing again. I just can't put it down. One of my favorite Michener novels and certainly one of my all-time favorite blockbuster novels.basis for a musical but nothing compares to reading the original. I couldn't put it down.

He created memorable characters, intriguing future societies and usually stunning plotlines.<br /><br />I like nearly all his books enough to give each 5 stars. But a few leave me unsatisfied, and \\"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\\" is one of them. Not that I didn't buy it, devour it, and re-read it about twenty times. (It IS written by the Master, after all.) But this is, forgive me O Great One, not his best work.<br /><br />It's been said Heinlein was maundering in his dodder years. Well, he was seriously ill for two or so years before he wrote this novel. But I think RAH on a bad day was sharper than most of us on a good one. No, I think this novel suffers from \\"wrap-up complex.\\" This is my term for a thing authors do when they want closure on a character or subject, but have EITHER written themselves out or have NOT yet finished. Hence, the \\"closure\\" doesn't work. If you want other examples of failed closure, Arthur Conan Doyle comes to mind, trying to kill off Sherlock at the Reichenbach Falls, and I bet you can think of lots of these yourself.<br /><br />Maureen Johnson, the mother of Woodrow Wilson Smith a.k.a. Lazarus Long, is the center of this novel that harks back to Maureen's first marriage to Brian (\\"Time Enough for Love\\") through the Future History novels (\\"The Past Through Tomorrow\\", \\"Methuselah's Children\\") up and past the end of \\"Time Enough.\\" That's great--we want Maureen's story after the shocking yet seductive story of Ted \\"Bronson\\" aka Lazarus and his affair with Maureen when he travels back in time in \\"Time Enough for Love.\\" Maureen is HOT, and I am not just referring to her flame-red hair.<br /><br />But Heinlein goes way out, with Maureen more than hinting that she had the hots for her own father Ira. There is a lot more free-sex blather at the end of the book that, though I am hardly a prude, did not particularly appeal to me. The whole plot seemed, as wrap-up novels will, contrived and stupid. And excesses of incest are eventually nauseating. It's ok to push the envelope on societal taboo for speculative fiction's purposes, but ultimately, a taboo IS a taboo and thus not something the average reader (like me) want ENORMOUS gobs of in their reading. At that point, it gets sickening and should be relinquished to the slash fiction realm. In my opinion.....<br /><br />HOWEVER, having ranted about all that, other than the plot flaws and ramblings, it's nice to have Maureen's book, even if flawed, and I am glad Heinlein had time before he left us to pen the story for us. I just wish it had been done with more finesse.and stupid. And excesses of incest are eventually nauseating.

Would you be better off, or would you make matters worse. What if you could be transported in time? What would you do, what would you not do? That's the premise of \\"Undo the Deed.\\"<br />James' speculation makes for an interesting novel. In some ways, it is reminiscent of the famous book by Marge Piercy \\"A Woman On the Edge of Time\\" --in that novel a woman in an abusive relationship finds herself transporting back and forth in time. Here, the protagonists get choices, take chances. If you like speculative fiction, and fiction that deals with an emotionally charged subject such as abuse, you will find \\"Undo the Deed\\" fascinating. I did. (The subject can of course be disturbing if you are a victim of child abuse--so be forwarned. )	2003-01-15

The author Barry Patrick Fitzsimmons sets his characters in the world of Cosmette, a city in the future, with mega-urban problems on steroids. The avenue where the main character lives is called &quot;Democracy Avenue&quot; or &quot;Dem Ave&quot; and is a parking nightmare. Roving bands of tow truck pirates vie with each other to confiscate your car. But you HAD to park illegally. It's a constant, nerve-wracking battle. Hmmm. Sounds like Comm Ave in Boston. Then Fitzsimmons describes some acrobatic traffic maneuvers. WAIT! If that ain't Boston set sometime in the dark future, I will eat my Boston Baked beans with ketchup. The futuristic food store where the main character works is nothing short of brilliant, and the scene where the hapless night manager tries to collar a shoplifter had me absolutely laughing outloud. The best part of the book was the separation of the mainstream workers, and their sad hierachy, with low level workers bearing all the brunt of society's ills and few perks, with the world of the drop-outs, who perhaps wisely had given up being a numbered cog. I think this book could make a great film.<br />This is a funny funny book, with plays on words, amusing action, beautifully described so that you can picture the world of Cosmette absolutely as if a film were rolling behind your eyes. It reminds me of some works by science fiction master Frederick Pohl. My only criticism is that the author is so intent on creating this stunning, wildly crazy world that he takes a bit of time to unfold the plot action. No matter, this is still a fine bit of speculative fiction. I hope Barry will write more!	2003-01-15

Each gemstone is listed with density (vital for indentification), crystalline structure, light refraction angle (single or double), chemical makeup and hardness. There is an introductory section that is a good reference on mineral properties, a section on gem cutting, and small historical section.<br />My only objection to this book is that it is incomplete; there are a lot of semiprecious stones like gaspeite, for example that are not listed. So, not a complete reference, but a very good one that covers a wide range of information.	2003-01-02

Visually and text-wise, this book is boring, but it may provide valuable technical information for those that are delving into the principles of design on computer.

Vets will tell you of the horrible plight of abandoned animals, of the growing number that are euthanized by animal control shelters, and of the heroic efforts of animal rescue leagues, who save animals, rehabilitate them and find loving homes for them. We have two rescue cats--great pets, and really believe strongly in adopting pets from rescue leagues.<br />&quot;The Man Who Talks to Dogs&quot; is the story of Randy Grim who has dedicated his life to rescuing dogs. He drives around the St. Louis area in his van, capturing strays, finding homes for them and educating the public about the problem. There is a lot of interesting information about the problem of stray dogs in the US. This includes statistics about dogs killings of humans, of the number of people bitten. It also is a story about the sadness --of dogs who are sick, dogs who can't be rehabilitated, of euthanizing thousands of animals.<br />This is not always a happy book; so many animals cannot be saved and so many are traumatized beyond curing or rehabilitation. But the story is heroic. If you love animals and are considering adopting a dog, this is a good book to have. And if you are adopting a dog and considering not neutering it, it's a must-read.	2003-01-02

But Thad Carhart includes so much atmosphere and quirky French character in his memoir \\"The Piano Shop\\" that if you like memoirs, especially about life in France, you will be as charmed as I was whether you know one note from another or not.<br /><br />Andre Watts, the great American pianist, once remarked that he is unable to walk in a room with a piano without going up to it and touching it. This urge is not unusual with piano lovers--most of us are pulled into any piano shop, compelled by the same love of the instrument, each one of which is as individual as a person. And this individuality is despite the fact that pianos, as Carhart points out, were one of the first mass-produced items in modern industrial society.<br /><br />Carhart, too, is irresistibly drawn into a mostly-shuttered piano shop in his quartier of Paris. It seems unlikely the shop is merely a piano repair studio--do they, perhaps, sell secondhand instruments? Carhart, who loves to play as an amateur, decides to find an instrument. The crusty owner will hardly divulge information. Slowly, Carhart penetrates the mysterious, very private and French world of the piano shop, and it becomes a part of his life.<br /><br />The shop owner Luc, his drunken tuner Jos, and all the other characters are well drawn and interesting, even tragic sometimes. The book ends up being about a lot more than pianos. This is a real treat of a book to curl up with in an armchair, perhaps with a glass of wine or a cup of tea and find yourself lost in a twisty Parisian alley, peering into dusty windows and wondering how what goes on behind the shutters of a dark Paris atelier.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2002-12-31

I am a sucker for memoir-based fiction and memoir, especially travel memoir. But Mr. Zubry's deceptively simple style and ability to zing you with \\"the moral of the story\\" had me hooked instantly.<br />The first tale in the book sets up an idyllic scene in ageless Araby. It's Saudi Arabia, but to the generations of simple shopkeepers, life has not changed appreciably in centuries. A father, a shopkeeper in a line of shopkeepers going back to hazy memory has a precious single son. Will his son, who now goes to school 4 hours a day by goverment mandate, be a shopkeeper like him? Or will he aspire to more? He is full of promise, a good boy. The shop comes into some luck--a wealthy group of travelers come to town and patronize the shop. The family is happy to serve their needs while they are in town. But as the story unfolds in Zubry's fable-like tone, you dimly wonder if you aren't being set up for a nasty blow. Oh, you bet you are. But it still comes as a surprise, and I had to read the story twice to grasp the impact as well as the way the author had told the tale.<br />The other stories are of Zubry's childhood growing up in the Soviet Union, his dreams, his artistic drive, and his travels as he works on projects in Saudia Arabia and in Washington State. Pieces of pure fiction are also to be found--are they stories someone told him or works of pure imagination? I don't know, but each story retains Zubry's unique ability to tell a tale in the simplest words with imagery and deep emotion. They feel \\"true\\" --they may be true, but whether or not they actually occurred, they have that element of poetic truth that makes fiction worth reading not only for entertainment but for learning about life.<br />I highly recommend this book--it should appeal to a wide range of readers due to the variety of the content, the limpid style, and the irresistible pleasure of being told a good tale. Bravo, Mr. Zubry! Write more, please, some more!told a good tale. Bravo, Mr. Zubry! Write more, please, some more!	2002-12-20

A list of brands that have bit the evolutionary dust: American Motors, Burger Chef, Eastern Airlines, Gainesburgers, Hathaway Shirts and Woolworth's tells the tale. In contrast, Nokia, Popeye's Chicken, Bose and Walmart are successfully evolving and creating the differentitation that keeps their customers and grows their business.<br />There is a Hall of Shame of CEO's who failed to understand this principle, and the important fact that the CEO must be involved in understanding and spearheading differentiation. But most of the examples in this book are plenty familiar to readers of \\"In Search of Excellence.\\"  This is an enjoyably written book, but at most it makes one point: create your unique quality and stay ahead of the wave.	2002-12-12

Like any good memoir, it takes in the uncomfortable, even embarrassing moments as well as the lighter and uplifting ones.<br />Walker includes a lot of detail, from procedures like reconstruction, chemotherapy right down to the day-to-day patient care and how she felt emotionally. But this is not a gruesome story--instead it is intended to help anyone else along the road to recovery. The best chapter \\"Where do I go from here\\" gives eight important points (such as taking charge of your treatment, talking to your family, dropping the Wonder Woman cape for women who do it all) and also useful addresses and a list of books.<br />This book is interesting reading for any woman, but if you have a loved one facing this challenge or if you are a woman who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, you should get this book. Nothing I have read comes close to this book for frankness and assistance.	2002-12-05

By manipulating the amount of moisture ON the paper and IN the wash of paint, Zbuvic creates strong contrast between ethereal washes and densely painting architectural or landscape elements.<br />Zbuvic uses a device he calls a clock, which consists of a circle divided into wedges; the left side gauging the amount of water on the paper (from shiny wet to bone dry) and the right side gauging the amount of water mixed into the paint, from weak &quot;tea&quot; to &quot;butter&quot; or thick paint. This is rather original, but it does communicate an awareness of the moisture levels in both paint and paper to the artist. One example painting that really stands out is a rainy scene of downtown Melbourne, Australia. The street is lightly washed to allow the paper beneath to create the white shine of a wet street; the buildings and headlight reflections are painted more densely to provide either solidity (the building) or glow (the headlights.)<br />Most books on watercolor demonstrate a layered method of washes followed by glazes (paint over paint.) The end result can often be muddy for beginners in watercolor. This method is quite different in how it describes laying down washes and glazes, and can help the watercolorist achieve transparent atmosphere effects by paying attention to the water. If you've run into a brick wall with your current method of painting, this might be a great book to give a boost to your technique.	2002-11-21

There were three Walker treasuries and now there are four. This book includes the previously-published &quot;Sampler Knitting&quot; and in addition, 82 stitch patterns never published before. Most of these are complicated all-over texture and lace, but there is an attractive textured teddy bear and a lace stitch that looks like a butterfly. The sampler has a lot of intricate cables. Fun for afghans.<br />While there are many stitch pattern &quot;dictionaries&quot;, the Walker series is very large and comprehensive. Knitters who like to design their own knit patterns will appreciate the new material. If you only knit from printed patterns, it's fun to take a standard pattern like a sock cuff and add lace or textured stitches and create something completely new. This is a nice addition to the previous trilogy of Walker stitch patterns and a welcome addition for the avid knitter who likes to design.	2002-11-21

Now, as all students know, the Norman conquest of England culminated in 1066 with the Battle of Hastings, where William the Conqueror struck Harold in the eye with a lance and won the battle.<br />The elder military nobleman tells how he became intangled in the Norman invasions. The book is written as a tale told, so the action is all from Count Guy's point of view and reads almost as a diary. This, plus the well-researched background give this book the feel that it was written on parchment and really just unearthed underneath the altar of some abbey to be translated for scholars to argue over.<br />But memoir-like tone aside, the book is packed with action, battles and political maneuvering. It will probably appeal to men a bit more than women, since this is a book about war and not a romantic-style historical drama. Readers who like such books as \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" will probably enjoy \\"Jackals in Iron.\\"	2002-11-05

If you love Fairisle style knitting, this book is definitely for you. It is a compilation of sweaters knit by attendees of Meg Swansen's Knitting Camp, a famous knitting event held every year in Wisconsin.<br />These knitters are some of the most experienced and creative around, so it is interesting to see what they can, as a group, come up with when challenged to create a knitted garment using all-over patterning and the rainbow of colors available in 2 ply Shetland wool.<br />Of the 38 designs, my hands-down favorite was Ann Feielson's &quot;Shirt-Tailed Fair Isle&quot; with its complicated rounded hem and gorgeous colorway.  A close second was Joyce Williams' Shaded Latvian Vest--she's able to create some amazingly complicated and lovely designs.<br />If you don't like Fair Isle (changing 2 colors on every row, with many color changes over the entire garment) this book will not be for you. Nor are these patterns all &quot;traditional&quot; Fair Isle, with the typical OXO and peerie designs (wider bands of large X's and O's alternated with narrower bands of tiny patterns with a short repeat of 4 to 6 stitches.) These patterns are done using Shetland yarns, with typical all-over patterning and 2-color changing per row, but they move far afield from the traditional Fair Isle as typified in Katherine Misegades' interpretation of the Prince of Wales Vest, modeled after the famous vest modeled by royalty and causing a resurgence of popularity of Fair Isles in the early-mid 20th Century.<br />The photos are lovely, showing the beautiful Wisconsin countryside and making you wish, perhaps, that you could attend Knitting Camp and see some of these wonderful knits as they fall off the needles. A pretty book, and useful to those who love colorwork and patterns.	2002-10-29

Her prose is possibly some of the best writing from the 20th Century, so the difficulty in getting her books was rather puzzling. If you read anyone who writes about cuisine, they always refer to M.F.K. Fisher as some kind of luminary. In &quot;The Art of Eating&quot;, there is every opportunity to examine why her writing is held in such high esteem.<br />This book is a compilation of her most famous works &quot;Consider the Oyster,&quot; &quot;Serve It Forth,&quot; &quot;How to Cook a Wolf,&quot; &quot;The Gastronomical Me&quot; and &quot;An Alphabet for Gourmets.&quot;  Each is quite different. &quot;How to Cook a Wolf&quot; is about cooking in times of want, in this case, World War II, but the book really becomes semi-autobiographical and talks about her young days in Dijon, where she was the wife of a student at the University.<br />If you haven't read M.F.K. Fisher, this is probably the best book to start with--it combines memoir with culinary musings; advice on scrambled eggs with her own ideas about health and nutrition. If you then can't get enough of Fisher, I recommend, &quot;The Measure of Her Powers&quot; which is much more autobiographical and utterly fascinating.<br />I actually read Fisher more for her memoirs. Her fascination with food and cooking is to me about life and art,--the French view of food not as something merely to fill the belly, but as an art form and a craft.	2002-10-27

If you haven't enjoyed Groening's non-Homer-and-Bart material, you are in for a real treat.<br />Of the &quot;Hell&quot; books (and they are all as funny as hell) I like this one the best. There are plenty of Groening's signature chart cartoons, where he fills out a panel with &quot;The 9 types of Boyfriends&quot; or my particular favorite &quot;The Teenage Guide to Crime and Punishment&quot; which includes the Crime of Teenage Pregnancy with the boy sulking &quot;I only put it in a little&quot; and the girl simultaneously saying &quot;We're in LOVE!&quot;<br />And then there is &quot;Akbar and Jeff&quot; --two crazy guys in fezzes, and Groening's poke at small business with his &quot;Hut&quot; chain of stores like Tofu Hut. (not sure if that one is in Love is Hell, but there are plenty more.)<br />I must've bought at least 6 copies of this because I keep giving it away as presents. It's really, really funny. If you think Groening was just &quot;Simpsons&quot; and then dropped off with &quot;Futurama (what's with THAT?!) then you might be pleasantly surprised by his cartoonist abilities.	2002-10-22

Bill Bryson is usually known for books that provoke an uncontrollable urge to laugh out loud while reading them. That's certainly true of \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" where Bryson and a bibulous friend try manfully to hike the Appalacian Trail. It's not so true in \\"Notes from a Small Island.\\"<br /><br />Bryson doesn't have his hapless friend Katz along on this jaunt, a walking trip through Great Britain. But his sense of humor is intact and his eye sharp for local foibles. My favorite observation was actually his description of the boundless joy the British express when presented with a steaming hot cup of tea. \\"Ah, lovely...\\" At the fifth repetition of this, you begin to appreciate Bryson's description of the British people and their funny rules, such as one that applies to public paths (you can cut right through anything that lies on a public way, and Bryson struts through some remarkable places exercising this right.) He takes the predictable potshots at British Rail and the propensity for tearing down quaint buildings and putting up steel and concrete monstrosities, a trait that Americans seem to share with their British progenitors; I myself felt strangely at home in Birmingham--it could have been any American city except for driving on the wrong side of the road.<br /><br />While this book was not as scream-with-laughter funny as \\"Walk in the Woods\\", it had its moments. If you are a Bryson fan you might be a bit disappointed as this books is a bit subdued compared to his others. And Katz is nowhere to be found. But if you don't require to be entertained every single page, you probably will find this an amusing book. I did.	2002-10-22

Mostly, this is a \\"care and feeding of\\" book that could apply to any cat, which is what this book is really for. If you are new to cat ownership and have a Maine Coon, this will get you started.<br />We have Maine Coon rescue cats and we don't plan to breed any cats (preferring to adopt orphans--there's a glut of cats out there.) But if you were planning to breed Maine Coons, you surely would need a more comprehensive book than this slim volume.<br />However, if you just want some general background about the history, pictures of coat colors and information about the general qualities of this breed, this book is just fine. The most valuable page is actually in the back, describing various illnesses, with a black and white drawing and description of a cat \\"not doin' right\\", which is how a cat subtly tells you it is feeling sick. We caught our cat \\"not doin' right\\" and she was actually on the point of being seriously ill. We caught it in time--thanks to that helpful description --cats are sometimes not terribly expressive, purring even in pain and perking up if their beloved owners are around.	2002-10-21

Spin-Off is Interweave Press's magazine devoted to the art of handspinning fiber. The sock issue sold out and there was quite a lot of demand for a reprint. So the publishers kindly printed up the socks featured in the magazine and added notes for using commercial wools.<br />Some of the patterns are particularly useful and are ones you won't find elsewhere. For example, there is a pattern for exceptionally warm and comfy fleece-lined socks. There are also a lot of just plain gorgeous socks, plus advice on Kool-Aid(tm) dyeing, a technique that uses unsweetened drink mix to dye wool in all sorts of shades.<br />If you are a handspinner, this book will speak to you, but even if you are not ever going to try spinning or have access to hand-spun yarn, the sock patterns here are useful and imaginative.	2002-10-21

Lopi is a long-staple wool from Icelandic sheep. It's lightly spun, incredibly warm and produces those popular bulky ski sweaters with colorful yokes knitting in the round.<br />... This book takes advantage of the new colors and updates the classic round yoke styles with new raglan style cardigans, pullovers, textured knitting (possible with light Lopi) and accessories like hats and mittens.<br />In particular, I admired the Luter pullover, done in a deep blue with a bronzy mix of colors in the yoke. It reminded me of a Bohus design. I also loved the Annika cardigan, classic styling but in shades of lovely cobalt blues. The Gudjon cardigan, done in Lopi Lite shades of green is a great style for a man and light enough to wear inside as well as outside. (Lopi is SO warm, it can be too heavy as indoor wear. I knitted one such pullover from yarn bought in Iceland, and it was warm enough to wear as a winter coat while shoveling snow in near-zero temperatures kn New England. ... The designs in this book should also last and last--they are classics and I think you could be knitting from this book decades from now with no worry about looking dated. The photography is rich and professional. If you love ski sweaters and Lopi, you will probably love this book.	2002-10-17

The title of this knitting book is accurate; you'll find thirty simple, straight lined knitting patterns for sweaters, tops, cardigans, jackets, hats and throws. Most of them are done in the trendy bulky wools that have become a hot item with the young and fashionable. If you are one of those \\"young and fashionable\\" who longs to learn knitting and make a trendy outfit to wear, you are going to like this book a lot.<br />The initial chapter illustrates basic knitting instruction with good drawings. However, if you are a brand-spankin' new knitter, it's probably a good idea to supplement this with a video or lessons from a knitting friend.<br />The rest of the book is devoted to various styles of clothing, including the popular funnel-neck pullovers and their kissin' cousin the turtleneck. There are sexy tank tops, from slim and summery to more season-crossing sleeveless tops that could go under a jacket in fall or even winter.  There is a long jacket that is particularly nice and a poncho or ruana based on rectangles that looks elegant.  There are quite a few models even I would knit, and I am not particularly a fan of the bulky yarn trend (and I certainly am not young and fashionable.)  The back of the book lists the yarn sources, for those who want to replicate the models in identical wools.<br />If you don't like the bulky style, however, this book really isn't for you. There isn't a lot of fine detail work, color work, or other fancy technique. As the title says, this is simple. If you are a new young and trendy knitter, this book will probably become your designing bible-that is, until the styles change. And when they do, you can adapt these classic shapes to new yarns and new trends. Meanwhile, you can learn knitting from these patterns, as it is far easier to begin with straight lines and big yarns.<br />Recommended highly for new knitters and young knitters especially.<br />Joanna Daneman	2002-10-16

Eco is a very clever writer; he can combine these seemingly incompatible elements and make a book that's hard to put down.<br /><br />I certainly couldn't put it down as I followed Brother Adso, the monk who narrates the story. When a novice in a monastery in 1327, Adso accompanied the brilliant William of Baskerville on an investigation into mysterious deaths amongst the monks. Each death is more and more bizarre; the method of murder perplexing. The key to the murders is locked in the labyrinthine passages of the monastery, incredibly well-described by Eco. The library, in particular, is fraught with dangers. The descriptions are so vivid that I can close my eyes and picture the scenes in the bath, the kitchens and the library with great detail. Eco is masterful in creating visual richness.<br /><br />The novel is larded with Latin phrases, theological and literary arguments which may annoy readers who have not included these weighty subjects in their education. No matter, you can read this mystery and enjoy the clever revelation of clues and solution. Eco does play on \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" with \\"Baskerville\\" as a clue to the mental prowess of Sir William. If you like a good mystery and historical fiction, it doesn't get a lot better than \\"Name of the Rose.\\"	2002-10-15

Scriabin, a \\"bridge\\" composer between the 19th and 20th Century, composed romantic yet modernistic works sometimes reminiscent of Chopin. His later work was far more dense and individualistic. Unfortunately, he died in his 40's, but, like the short-lived Schubert,he left a considerable volume of works for the piano. The other Dover volumes are the Sonatas and the Preludes and Etudes. Logically, they put other minor works (nocturnes, dances, etc) into this volume.<br />If you are a skilled pianist, try the Op. 28 Fantasie. This work, sadly, is rarely recorded but is one of the most incredibly gorgeous things ever written for piano. The only other copy of this I own is in a Hungarian edition not available in the US, so rejoice if you play piano.<br />Dover prints music that is easy to read and the editing is usually blameless. This book is no exception. Highly recommended for serious piano students.	2002-10-03

This is a story of sin and redemption, with the horrors of the sins, incest and unbridled lust, making the redemption all the more spectacular.<br />The style is elegant, stylishly mocking the medieval archaic German which is well-rendered into a stylized antique English by the talented Mrs. Lowe.  The story is as gripping as any soap opera but the artistry with which it is told is exquisite. As usual, Mann blends his story-telling ability with his genius as a writer of ideas. I can hardly think of another writer who comes close to being able to combine a good yarn with incredible style and deep concepts (maybe Melville and Nabokov, perhaps.)<br />This is a good preparatory book for &quot;Joseph and his Brothers&quot;--a monumental book about the biblical story of Joseph in Egypt.	2002-10-01

Jean Rhys, the troubled author who was far ahead of her time in the 1920's, felt a strange kinship with Antoinette or Bertha Mason, the madwoman locked in the attic in Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\" From the first time Rhys read \\"Jane Eyre\\" she knew she would someday write her story because she felt she'd lived it.<br />Like Antoinette, Rhys grew up in the Caribbean, a troubled and hermetic world of Creoles, colonists and former slaves. Antoinette is truly a loner--the reversal of family fortunes causes her to be rejected by her own people, and despised by those who previously were on a lower rung of society. Throughout the novel, Antoinette is used, buffeted and never in charge of her own life. She feels that, as a woman, she is an object, not a person. As a woman, she is not in charge of her ultimate destiny, and this provides the conflict for the novel. Her madness is only an extension of this isolation and rejection.<br />What makes Rhys a masterful novelist is her use of conversation and immediate events to describe the world in which Antoinette lives. There are no long passages of exposition; we see the world only through the eyes of the characters, mostly at the same time that they experience it. However, the immediate events and conversation or narration are so cleverly constructed that the reader sees through the narrator's eyes and can really see and feel the surroundings. This intimate point of view puts the reader in the skin of the character, but can be a bit confusing because we cannot always rely on the veracity of the narration. The point of view itself switches in the novel from first person to third person, in the second part, and back to first in the third and final portion, where Antoinette is locked in the attic.<br />The novel is in no way a re-write or version of \\"Jane Eyre.\\" In \\"Jane Eyre\\", the madwoman is not really a character--she's a symbol for evil, for carnal and worldly desires yielded to without regard for the soul. \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" develops the madwoman into a character. Rhys slyly copies the beautiful symmetry of \\"Jane Eyre\\", where events occur in a sort of repetition; in \\"Jane Eyre\\", the heroine must leave a hostile home and find a haven, which then becomes hostile because it fails to nourish her soul with love (Gateshead, Lowood, Thornfield and then Marsh House. Only when Jane can marry her Mr. Rochester on HER terms, does she find a true home.) In \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\", Antoinette's home burns twice, a similar use of symbolism, here representing rejection by the world.<br />\\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" is often listed as a \\"must-read\\" book --it certainly is a unique book and was far ahead of its time when Rhys wrote it.

I can hardly pick which one I liked best, which is unusual for an anthology; most of the time, for me, only one or two short stories will stand out from the rest. Here, Card and the judges who picked these have collected the best of the best. In particular, I liked &quot;They Go Bump&quot;, a story about invisible soldiers (being invisible is not as much of an advantage as one would suppose) and &quot;22 Buttons&quot;--a futuristic tale about social mores and isolation. I read every one work in this book with total amazement at the writing skill. If you want to try your hand at writing science fiction, these wonderful examples can inspire (or discourage) you.<br />My only complaint is that the book was not what I would consider a good value, even with the excellence of each of the works in this anthology.

Like Rachmaninoff, he was a bridge composer between the late Romantic and the 20th Century period. He was far more modern, in fact, than Rachmaninoff, though his early works were profoundly influenced by Chopin (Rachmaninoff less so--he was influenced by Chopin but also Tchaikovsky.)<br />Despite the fact both composers shared Russian heritage and a love of the piano, Rachmaninoff did not admire Scriabin's works, saying he had gone off in a wrong direction. While I love Rachmaninoff's piano works intensely, I have to say that he was really wrong about Scriabin. This is some of the most gorgeous, introspective, Impressionist piano music ever written.<br />Scriabin had a tragically short life, yet he composed quite a number of etudes, preludes, sonatas and other short piano works. Dover has done a huge favor by putting all the preludes and etudes into a single volume. There is enough material here for years of exploration into the music of a piano master. The edition is a compact volume that manages to sit well on the piano music stand, and the music print is clear and easy to read.	2002-09-28

Instead of starting at a hem (or a neck if you do top-down knitting), you make small \\"potholder\\" or tiles in knitted squares or strips. Then, using a \\"sew-as-you-knit\\" technique, you add square upon square, strip next to strip, and make your garment piece. In a way, it's like coloring in a line drawing in a coloring book, using small knitted modules to complete the front, back or sleeves. Those who learn this method of knitting say that it is addictive, and I can affirm that. I find it quite enjoyable. Many knitters find that it is less stressful on the hands, too--only a small piece is knitted at any one time, even though it might be attached to the larger part of a project.<br />Vivian Hoxbro is a Danish designer who was very smitten with Horst Schulz' \\"Patchwork Knitting.\\" She attended his seminar in Berlin, and went back to Denmark to adapt it to her own ideas. Being Scandinavian, she uses simpler designs and more understated color schemes than the bright colorways Schulz favors. And her approach in this book is different, too. Rather than have you follow the pattern for a garment, she presents a number of potholder projects that teach various ways to knit and join modules. When you've mastered the potholders, you can progress on to coffee pot warmers, backpacks, shawls and hats. Hoxbro's colorways are novel and fashionable and her designs are quite clever--how about a knitted cache-pot to cover an African violet pot? Or a denim-like backpack or basket to hang on the Christmas tree. The modular aspect of domino knitting makes it versatile for more than just garments.<br />Most of the projects in this book are small, appropriate for learning a new technique. And also, the small projects are useful to learn patience, for, as Ms. Hoxbro points out, domino knitting is slower than standard knitting. I am in the middle of a project (a large jacket) and I can say that it is slower, but one reason for that is due to the size needle and yarn (2.5 mm needles and 2 ply shetland yarn.) However, once I mastered the technique, I found that the knitting progresses rather quickly after all, and it's quite hypnotic.<br />This book, which is a translation of the original Danish edition, is a small paperback.

Of these, \\"The Dosadi Experiment\\" is by far one of the best.<br /><br />Dosadi is an artificially populated planet with a dark, dark secret. Jorg X. McKie, who was introduced in a companion novel \\"Whipping Star\\" is sent to investigate the goings-on on Dosadi, an assignment that could very well lead to his destruction.<br /><br />Dosadi is a toxic planet, where survivors live either in an overpopulated fortress of a city and survive on their wits, or struggle to live on the poisonous Rim, where the very soil and plants are enemies. The people of Dosadi are tough indeed, but they are a lot more than just tough survivors. They hold a desperate secret that could upset the balance of the rest of the galaxy.<br /><br />McKie's struggle to survive and to discover Dosadi's secrets make for a really exciting tale. The characters are vivid, creative (all kinds of sentient species) and very interesting. If you love good science fiction, this is a must-read.	2002-09-27

He excels in the novella genre, and the writing in &quot;Byzantium&quot; is nothing short of exquisite. Silverberg creates an entire future society, yet reveals each fact with perfect timing, dropping them into place as precisely as a safecracker dropping tumblers into the lock of a safe. If you want to read a near-perfect  short work of fiction, this is it.<br />Turn this book upside down and Gene Wolfe's celebrated &quot;Seven American Nights&quot; is on the other side. The story unfolds with a diary of an Iranian visitor to the ruins of a future United States. The diary tells a story of an adventure in a land of mutants and ruined treasure for the taking. But is the writer reliable in what he tells us? The uncertainty of the information is skillfully crafted and teases the reader almost unbearably along each of the seven nights.<br />Both these stories are top-notch examples of short fiction writing, and masterpieces of science fiction. If you find a copy of this, snap it up.	2002-09-27

In particular, I admire  \\"The Santaroga Barrier\\" because it is set, not in the future, but in a town that could be anywhere today.<br />\\"The Santaroga Barrier\\" is set in a valley town in California. It looks completely normal--life is typically small-town, with small businesses and farms run by the locals. But for some reason, big merchandisers outside the valley cannot sell there. In an age where marketing demographics can tell precisely what brand of car, cigarette, cola or watch you are likely to buy by where you live and your age cohort, this is astounding.<br />What's also astounding is how Herbert forsees the age of online data-gathering (think, cookies on your browser) and huge mega-merchandisers like W*-mart who control huge blocks of buying power and who drain small towns of dollars that used to circulate and support local businesses.<br />But that's not the only threatening situation in Santaroga. What is with the \\"Jaspers\\" Cheese Co-op (is it a cult?) and why did the previous marketing investigators sent by big business meet with unfortunate accidents? The story that unfolds is fascinating--are the Santarogans just minding their own business, or are they evil in some way, and whose side will you end up on at the end of the book? I really recommend this novel even if you don't like science fiction. It's one of my favorites.	2002-09-26

In &#34;Hellstrom's Hive&#34;, Herbert asks &#34;what if humans were genetically engineered to be an insect-colony organism?&#34;<br /><br />This book, written long before genetic manipulation and cloning was a reality, is scarier than ever. The insect-humans in this novel are cunning yet totally without the human reactions we would consider &#34;normal.&#34; This makes for some very disgusting scenes in &#34;Hellstrom's Hive&#34; and is possibly why this book has not yet been re-released along with the other Herbert novels that were out of print.<br /><br />But if you can get past some of the more chilling aspects of &#34;Hellstrom's Hive&#34; you are in for a real thriller. No one can write about smells, sights, tastes, and all aspects of the senses, combined with exciting action better than Frank Herbert. This book will stay with you. If you like a bit of horror in your sci-fi, this is for you.	2002-09-26

We watched with fascination as she did things with food we Americans didn't know you could do. Mom bought this cookbook then, and I still have it, cover hanging by threads and covered in all kinds of saucy stains. It's still going strong, getting more stains every time I give a dinner party.<br /><br />We learned how to make omelets, roasts, soups like Vichysoisse (surprisingly simple potato and leek soup), and how to cook the bumper crop of garden green beans in a new and very delectable manner.<br /><br />I still think that this may be one of the best cookbooks for vegetables that I have on my shelf. I prize it for the meat section, especially a veal ragout that is possibly one of the most luxurious company dishes for a dinner party. It can be made ahead, and in fact, improves if you do. There are a lot of delicious desserts, some complicated (like Creme Bavaroise) and some cakes such as Reine de Saba (Queen of Sheba), a darkly moist and modest looking little chocolate cake. This is easy to make, but so rich and delicious it should be banned by the AMA.<br /><br />What's not in here is French Bread. That's in Volume II. Just in case you were looking for that recipe, fyi.<br /><br />We made French-style green beans and the Reine de Saba cake one memorable Thanksgiving when we were very young, and even the kids (seven cousins, five of which were BOYS) sat politely glued to the table for the ENTIRE meal instead of getting up and running around halfway through the feast. The food was THAT good.<br /><br />While I don't make French food every day because I watch my weight, I do use this book for the principles of good food preparation, even if omitting cream or substituting lower fat choices. I still find that these recipes are the ones I use as the \\"gold standard\\", whether it's boeuf bourguignon or a pear recipe (pears with macaroons) that has stood me in stead as a quick but unusually good dessert for years.

It's big, it's complete and it has just about any bread including crackers. (Like author Clayton, I love crackers.) But recent bread books,especially those artisan books, surpass The &quot;New Complete Book of Breads&quot; for getting that European effect, especially for free-form wheat breads like ciabatta and Tuscan bread.<br />However, this book shines for the American kitchen, in which you might not be using all the latest gadgets or have re-created a stone hearth. The recipes work well with the flours available in the grocery store and health food store, whereas you might need to mail order high-ash French-style flours from catalogs if you are working towards artisan breads.<br />The section on holiday breads like Panettone, Pandoro, challah and stollen are especially good. There is a Finnish bread that I especially admire.<br />So I find I still pull this book off the shelf when I want to make good bread, but don't want to agonize over getting crackly crusts, gel-like crumb or other artisan features of specialty breads. Easy, reliable and plenty of variety here.	2002-09-13

Did you, when you were an adolescent, speculate if it was actually possible to live your life without EVER lying, even to \\"little white lies?\\" I remember such a debate with my friends when I was in high school, and some of us even announced, rashly, that we were henceforth going to live completely \\"honestly.\\" Of course, this resolution lasted about 3 days until we ticked off the rest of our friends and our families and discovered that a lack of tactfulness is not the same as candor or forthrightness, and it's a poor way to go about life.<br />\\"The Inexquisite Eye\\" takes the same premise, living life without compromise and dispensing the bald truth. The main character, Elissa Laughlin, is a lawyer and her sudden decision to blurt out the truth and refuse to compromise her principles has her quickly in deep trouble. This is not only because she works at a law firm, where contouring truth is a profession, but because she soon alienates the few friends she has. And of course, she ends up lying plenty to justify her capricious actions.<br />My favorite scene in the book is one where a close friend tries to get help and advice for Elissa. The friend ends up revealing a conversation that Elissa's law firm had about her behind her back. This is a painful scene of betrayal and revelation, and it's written really well. No one who has ever had unpleasant information relayed to them by a confidant can fail to sympathize with Elissa. Clearly, her \\"truth-telling\\" and uncompromising posture is driven, not by a love of truth, but by her discomfort with the choices she's made. By becoming a porcupine, she hopes to drive away the success that beckons her and that she consciously can't bear to turn down.<br />This novel is one of the best I've read for depicting that difficult period in life-the time after college and graduate or professional school and during the start of a person's career. Strangely, we don't accept ourselves or even know ourselves well in our  30's. Instead, the 30's seem to be the time when we try to live up to other people's standards. When those standards conflict with our own inner tendencies, it can be a very painful time in life. Elissa's problem is not unusual; author Smith has chosen an excellent device in Elissa to illustrate her coming-of-age.

But &quot;The Insulin-Resistance Diet&quot; is probably the easiest to understand, the best-written and most no-nonsense of the lot.<br />The basic theory is this: an excess of certain types of carbohydrates, namely sugars and starches, exhaust the body's ability to respond to insulin. Insulin is the hormone that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) which is the basic gasoline that runs your muscles and brain. We break starches and complex sugars like the high-fructose corn syrup in your soda and the sucrose in your coffee, plus the starches in breads, cereals and vegetables down to that basic component glucose. Only then can the body fuel itself.<br />But, too much starch, too much sugar and the body, over time, loses its ability to respond to the insulin that's released, and we get Type II diabetes. We still can make insulin, but no longer make the receptors that pick it up. When insulin and receptors bind together, it sends a message thats tells the cells what to do with that glucose. The solution here is to eat a combination of carbs with protein to prevent too much insulin from having to be released, and to avoid high-glycemic foods, which means those foods that break down into LOTS of glucose.<br />This is so simple. I've been doing this for a month, and I've lost a bit of weight, which for me is a difficult thing. I feel far less hungry if I follow the ideas here--mixing cottage cheese with lower glycemic foods like potatoes or whole grain rye, avoiding white rice, sweets and other problematic foods. I still sneak an ice cream or a roll once in a while, but I know how to balance it with a high protein, low fat cheese or tofu. While I have to watch that I don't eat just carbs for a meal, it is rewarding not to feel so hungry. Hey, this works.	2002-09-10

They are quite small in format, fit the knitting bag or purse. They aren't very long, though (96 pages) but the patterns are colorful and wearable.<br />I prefer this sock book to the other books in the On the Go series because here, size doesn't matter (some of the Vogue sweaters and vests aren't sized up for large people.) Socks, however, can be worked up as-is for adults, or can be easily adapted--you can always lengthen or shorten a sock pattern.<br />The colors are especially appealing and new. I've been toying with the idea of a mitred square sock for some time, and lo, here is Jaya's mitered square socks, saving me the time to develop my own pattern.<br />While this isn't a \\"absolutely must-have\\" book, it is a welcome addition of pretty sock patterns, the price is right-- worth it for the mitred sock, in my case.	2002-09-07

I really liked many of Mably's designs, which are in some ways simpler and bolder than Fassett's--though clearly inspired by his mentor. But the design work here is spotty. Some of the ideas such as a Gypsy-striped scarf and vest, are simple in concept but look stunning. Others are Kaffee-clones, such as stars on complicated backgrounds. And there are complete departures from the Fassett style, such as a sweater with an intarsia design of pitted olives. Very cute.<br />The problem with this book, however, is that the quality of the knitted models varies from great to just awful. I would never have let some of those photos see the light of day, let alone the pages of a book. Knitting boo-boos jump out of the page such as uneven motif joins in intarsia, bulgy and uneven increasing above the ribbing and other amateurish-looking knitting that would have a competent knitting editor shouting naughty words. Another problem is the reliance on Rowan yarns, which are expensive and go out of production rapidly. If you want to reproduce these styles exactly, in the colors and weights of yarn specified, you may find yourself on a wild-goose chase. And the yarns used are often cotton. Now, cotton is able to be dyed in deep and bright colors, and the sheen on a mercerized cotton yarn lends a brilliance to knitting that a matte wool cannot achieve. But knitting intarsia (a technique where yarns are knitted in independent color zones and linked on the wrong side with a twisting method) is incredibly difficult to do with cotton. This is because cotton drapes and does not adapt to fill gaps in tension variations. Wool is forgiving in this matter and the fuzzy surface also hides knitting flaws. With cotton yarns, the inevitable variations of hand knitting are magnified, though master knitters can compensate. If you are not experienced in intarsia, let me tell you that a horrific experience awaits you if your first attempts are with cotton yarns. So be forewarned. If you don't believe me, look at the \\"Olives\\" sweater which sadly illustrates the difficulties that even an experienced knitter can have with cotton and intarsia. Tragic.<br />The sweater shapes in this book do vary from the wide and loose Fassett style (that does not always flatter the wide and voluptuous among us) and there are slimming v-necks and nicely done tunics. That's good. There are many design ideas here that are interesting and attractive, as well as some good colorways. However, other color choices were garish and muddy-looking.<br />So, if you like the Fassett style and are looking for more inspiration, you may find it here. But the uneven quality and the fact that many of these styles were previously published in Rowan books elsewhere, limit the value of this book.st attempts are with cotton yarns. So be forewarned.

And is there something for either the new knitter or the experienced? The answer is YES to all these questions. Here's why.<br />1. This book focuses on the development of the Philosopher's Wool yarns and is written by the owners of that company. It provides wonderful photographs of their distinctive designs and very excellent instructions for re-creating the attractive sweaters.<br />2. In addition to patterns, there are lavish illustrations, clearly drawn, showing the tubular knitting technique, whereby sweaters are knit seamlessly in the round and then cut to create open jacket fronts and button-down vests. This is similar to the Norwegian method of knitting, and well described with excellent hints.<br />3. The yarns (admittedly all Philosopher's Wool products) are appealingly presented to show colorways. If you aren't going to knit one of their projects, or if you don't succumb to the temptation to buy their wool, you can use these colorways with any other yarns. The photographs of yarns and model sweaters are really excellent. The book format is large, so the photos are detailed and beautifully rendered.<br />4. The concept of random yarn changes to create a complicated colorwork background, which is used by such top designers as Kaffe Fassett, is well described and charted. In particular, the Trillium sweater shows how to change yarns on a foreground flower and background stripe to achieve a sophisticated look that belies the relative simplicity of the technique.<br />The story of how this Ontario couple started their successful business is inspiring to read. Even though this book is geared to their own wool and designs, anyone who likes to do colorwork knitting can use the techniques and examples given in this book to branch out on their own ideas. In summary, a book of useful techniques for colorwork knitting that can be applied to other types of yarns, if you choose.	2002-09-07

And I have an equal love for the taste of those sun-warm, acid-sweet juicy fruits that make summer taste like summer. This year, finally moving to a tomato-friendly climate for the first time in two decades, I rushed to plant an heirloom tomato even in a container, before I could cultivate a true garden.<br /><br />Heirloom tomatoes come from seeds saved by tomato enthusiasts who have done us all the huge favor of preserving varieties of tomatoes that taste great, look interesting (all kinds of colors) and far better than the F1 hybrid boring red globes palmed off by the average seed company. While F1 hybrid tomatoes are easy and reliable and very disease-resistant, they often lack that huge tomato taste we all remember from childhood. (These hybrid tomatoes do have their place, however. Some of the modern hybrids will mature in a very short time, thus are the only tomatoes you can grow in hostile climates like Germany and New England.)<br />This book has all the information I need for next year's adventure in tomato culture. It lists 100 heirloom varieties, gives their strengths (resistance to common tomato ailments, pleasing taste, form) and their weaknesses as well. In addition, Dr. Male provides the history of the variety, which is interesting reading.<br /><br />The pictures by photographer Frank Iannotti are not only mouthwateringly lovely, but they accurately show a typical batch of tomatoes from a given cultivar--not all the fruits are perfect, some have typical defects such as stitching, weird shapes and other oddities. This gives you an accurate idea of what to expect.<br /><br />I compared Dr. Male's description of Yellow Brandywine to my experience this year. Right on every point, and her explanation of \\"Blossom End Rot\\" (an ailment that produces soft black disgusting spots at the blossom end of the fruit) was excellent. I found out my tomatoes were stressed by our constant brisk winds here in Delaware, not a deficiency of calcium in the soil or water. I know now I must plant a variety that is not prone to this defect, because it is often breezy here.<br />The front section of the book is devoted to tomato culture, and is very complete, showing staking and trellises, saving seeds, transplanting starter plants, and more.<br /><br />I rate this a big green THUMBS UP and will be salivating all winter as I plan my next tomato garden for 2003.risk winds here in Delaware, not a deficiency of calcium in the soil or water.

Author Mark Mathis presents rules of encounter with the press, but in a way that makes them memorable (even if horrifying in some aspects.) In fact, the best feature of this book, to me, were the real life success and failure stories. These are things anyone can relate to. Examples: the car dealer who immediately jumped in to donate a vehicle to a family who suffered a tragedy--the day after the tragic story was published. Charity? Sure, all the way to the bank via good-will publicity.<br />Anyone who has had any dealings with the media knows that stories get garbled, facts are lost or worse, in error, and the press picks up on the worst or most trivial aspect of your message while tossing away the &quot;meat.&quot; Plus our age of a 15-second attention span applies to the media; you'd better get your message out quickly and clearly or the media will roll over you on to the next soundbite.<br />My own recent encounter with a well-respected newspaper and an excellent reporter taught me that their angle on a story, which I thought was dead wrong, was the one that WOULD be published and my contrary facts would be pretty much ignored. I probably made quite a few mistakes I could have avoided, had I read this book.<br />If you intend to be feeding this &quot;beast&quot; you'd do well to read this book. It isn't a complete manual on publicity campaigns, but it is so entertainingly written that you will remember those important principles.	2002-08-21

But, if you don't own any other books on this subject, you might find this is just the ticket for expanding your abilities.<br />Here's an example of the exercises in the book: \\"Think like an alien.\\" Here, you are asked to examine flowers, trees, everything on Earth as if you dropped in from a flying saucer. A good idea. How would you describe a pansy to someone who'd never seen one? How would you draw it?<br />I prefer other volumes I already own (Carbonetti's \\"Making Pearls\\" and The Artist's Way, in particular) to Pencil Dancing. But, if you want a somewhat whimsical set of exercises and musing on creativity, this book may just do it for you. It didn't do it for me, but, because the creative process is so different for each individual, you may be entranced. How to judge? If you own other such books and like them a lot, this may not be a good choice. If you like fantasy and directed imagery, and some of the other creativity books seem a bit dull, you will probably like \\"Pencil Dancing.\\"	2002-08-19

I like to design my own patterns, but when in a hurry I like to follow a pattern \\"recipe.\\" This book allows me to do both: I can follow the blueprints here to make the basic garments or I can use them as a template for embellishments of my own. Now, that is supremely useful, so right away, \\"The Knitter's Handy Book of Patterns\\" got my vote as \\"most useful knitting book of the year.\\" In particular, this book is great for grabbing any yarn from your (embarrassingly large) yarn stash and knitting a quick gift for someone, making a charity project or replacing yet another hat or set of mittens left on the schoolbus (one author recommends you just knit mittens in sets of three and bow to the inevitable.)<br />The patterns include mittens, gloves, scarves and hats to vests, pullovers and cardigans. They can be knit in yarns ranging from the lightest fingering and baby weight to chunky and bulky.  Each pattern has a table, on which the vertical axis shows gauge and the horizontal the size. So it is a simple matter to take a yarn in your stash and use it for any of these patterns. (And that's good for reducing the huge pile of yarn collected over the years you may be hiding in the trunk of the car or the unused fridge in the basement.) There are also helpful technical tip sections on adding embellishments like colorwork, texture or edgings, and nice drawings of the techniques used. And there is a glossary of techniques and terms used.<br />This is a \\"handy\\" book, but you would still need some kind of sweater design book that gives a schematic for raglan and yoke style sweater designs. These are NOT included in this book. I believe that may have been a tough choice for the author and project editor in order to hold the size of the book down, or to complete the book on time (which, considering the variations of patterns, gauges and sizes must have been intense.) I wish both the yoke and raglan sweaters were here or at least a schematic of the famous \\"EZ Percentage System\\" which was devised to knit yoke and raglans in any gauge and size. However, this book is otherwise so useful that this deficiency, though regrettable, is not a showstopper--many basic books for knitters have these schematics. You probably have one on your bookshelf, as I do.<br />What I also admire about \\"Handy Patterns\\" is the choice of binding.

She also spins her own yarns and designs anatomically-fitting socks using the &quot;short-row&quot; technique.<br />For some knitters (like spatially-challenged little old me), the short row heel and toe method is hard to grasp, so if you long to do that kind of construction on your knitted footwear, this is a valuable reference book. The explanation of the shaping (it's an hourglass) and the description of what parts of the &quot;hourglass&quot; go where (front, back, top , bottom) are good. They are accompanied by ink drawings to illustrate the text.<br />There are schematics for various types of socks; toe up, toe down, short rowed, stripes vertical and horizontal, motif knitting in the round, and an especially good set of drawings on doing intarsia such as argyle, in circular knitting. Normally, intarsia is done flat knitting only.<br />The book has only line drawings with ink dots for shading. While it serves to put some dimension to the flatness of the sketches, I found the dot shading made the sock drawings look a bit strange.<br />If you are a sock knitter and want to advance your technique, this is a useful reference book and should be on the shelf next to Nancy Bush's Folk Socks. It's not as pretty a book as some, but I recommend it as a good technical reference.	2002-08-16

The book takes you from the early days of the English and Scots settlement of the twin islands up to present day, and reveals how knitting fit into daily life.<br />A good portion of the book is devoted to war knitting, which was a major volunteer activity in World War I and somewhat less, but still important in World War II. The interesting theme that runs through \\"The Loving Stitch\\" is that of privation and shortages; knitting yarn was often hard to obtain. During rationing in World War II, baby yarn was almost impossible to get, yet people were limited in clothing coupons. What to do for a newborn who needs clothes and plenty of them? The ingenuity of the Kiwis who wanted or needed to knit was amazing--#8 fencing wire became needles, tapestry yarn (not rationed) patiently gathered until enough was available to make a vest. One enterprising young girl unraveled loosely-woven sugar sacks to make a child's sweater. All this is of course set against the ironic background that New Zealand is a world-class producer of wool. Yet raw wool was merely sent overseas to be spun into carpet and other wool, and the New Zealanders found that the finished product, knitting wool, was hard to obtain and expensive, too.<br />What I found odd in this book were a couple of omissions and subjects only briefly touched one. One was the contribution to knitting by New Zealander Margaret Stove. She is contemporary, but this book does go up to present day, and including her would have been appropriate. I expected to see pictures of here handspun lace designs and perhaps a short section on how she learned handspinning (with a wheel and raw fleece donated by her sister so she, a schoolteacher on a limited budget, could clothe her family) . But Stove only merits a brief mention in the index. Other contemporary artists' knitting was pictured, so this omission seemed odd to me, especially because Mrs. Stove is well-known worldwide among handspinners.<br />The other deficiency was that Kiwicraft, which is a technique handrolling wool roving to make a thick and attractive yarn, was mentioned but the Kiwicraft yarns were not pictured. In general, the contribution and collaboration by Maori women was obliquely mentioned. While knitting and spinning is a Western contribution to New Zealand history, Kiwicraft was developed by a collaboration of missionaries and native women, and merited more illustration. It's unique to New Zealand. I wanted to know more and see more about it.<br />However, for a history of knitting, this is a fine addition to the library and is a fascinating insight into life in New Zealand.e Mrs. Stove is well-known worldwide among handspinners.<br />The other deficiency was that Kiwicraft, which is a technique handrolling wool roving to make a thick and attractive yarn, was mentioned but the Kiwicraft yarns were not pictured.

This heavy tome is packed with useful recipes and is all over the map, both ethnically and in types of recipes. As other Moosewood cookbooks, this is a vegetarian cookbook, but with asides into fish, which I don't mind--being one who limits meat but has not problem eating it. Some people do view fish as living creatures, which, of course, they certainly are.<br />What's also new here compared to the dairy-laden earlier books is a venture into a few vegan recipes that leave out all milk, egg and other animal-source product, including a recipe for very useful mock sour cream. So there's a little something for everyone, vegetarian, limited vegetarian and even vegan. The recipes tend to the family-style rather than super-gourmet.<br />One of the most useful recipes for me is a vegetable broth. This is a very good recipe base all kinds of soups. I despise the taste of canned broths and it's a nuisance to make chicken stock from scratch. Vegetable stock freezes well and this recipe makes a particularly flavorful version, using carrots, onions, celery, potatoes and garlic. The potatoes, in particular add consistency to the broth. The recipe offers either sweet potato or carrot for that sweet-spicy element and the sweet potato version also adds body to the broth. There is a version for mock-chicken broth, and an Asian ginger flavored broth base as well.<br />Italian dishes dominate the recipes, lots of pasta sauces, including a vegetarian kind of Bolognese (meat gravy), a good basic tomato sauce, frittatas, risottos and cioppino fish stew. There are also plenty of diversions into novelties such as an interesting peach salsa.<br />The breads lean more to biscuits and cornbread than to yeast breads and the dessert section is loaded with cookies. There are also sections on sandwiches, wraps and mock burgers.<br />In summary, this is a very good vegetarian-based home cooking book, maybe something like Joy of Cooking - Veggie-Style.  In that respect, this is a new classic, and certainly found a welcome home on my cooking bookshelf.ing book, maybe something like Joy of Cooking - Veggie-Style.

Bradbury's excellent prose allowed some of his novels to escape the \\"science fiction ghetto\\" and surely this is one book that made the jump over the barbed wire.<br />The plot is simple but shocking; books are dangerous to a trivial and controlling culture--therefore, burn them. Without books, there can be no memory of how things were or should be.  Montag is a fireman who's job is, of course, to start fires and create bonfires of contraband books. His wife is absolutely shallow and \\"normal\\"--she watches the daily soaps on TV, which in this futuristic society are full wall-sized plasma screens. She nags Montag to earn more so she can install a fourth screen and surround the room with the escape from reality. Even some part of her, however, senses the bleakness of the world, and witlessly tries to escape in an overdose of drugs.<br />Montag is dedicated in his work, but perhaps his investigative nature leads him into the world of the contraband book-hoarders. What drives a man to leap upon a funeral pyre of his library? A shaken Montag must find out.<br />Bradbury sketches the frightening world of a society with non-readers and non-thinkers, dumbed down by design. What did he see in the 50's that we are just realizing today? He was not only amazingly prescient in his description of wall-sized flatscreen TV, but in the trend to a world where education, reading, and reason are being made extinct, if not downright subversive.  Read this novel and marvel at Bradbury's chilling insights.	2002-08-08

Yet, you really can't help but be drawn into this microcosm of gentile upper-middle class English society set between the two World Wars in that frothy time period.<br />Nothing Lucia does is momentous, and she is an utter snob and pretentious to a nauseating level. Yet, we are captivated by her antics, stupid as they are. Predictably, her striving to be the Social Queen of Riseholme produces some deservedly embarrassing moments (she hires a Guru of dubious repute, for one thing.) But, being Lucia, she surmounts event the worst humiliation with sheer nerve.<br />The later novels pit Lucia against a far more worthy foe, Miss Mapp of Tilling. Miss Mapp even has her own novel sans Lucia, and the two tangle deliciously in the remaining four novels. If you like \\"Queen Lucia\\", you will adore the rest of the series.<br />Benson was the son of an Archbishop of Cantebury and had brilliant and artistic brothers and sisters. He was the longest-lived of the siblings, and produced many novels and scholarly histories, which sadly are out of print. Only these novels remain of his work, probably the most trivial. Yet the world they create, out of nothing but vanity and snobbish posing, is so captivating that their popularity almost never wanes.<br />The series contains:<br />Queen Lucia<br />Lucia in London<br />Miss Mapp<br />Mapp and Lucia<br />Lucia's Progress/The Worshipful Lucia<br />Trouble for Lucia<br />These are perfect escapist novels if you love things like \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" or BBC television.

When they issue the command  \\"Smarmy dog!\\" the dogs obligingly lift their lips and sneer. It's a hoot. Naturally, THEY would be the ones to buy \\"How to Massage Your Cat\\" and pass it around. Hey, animal humor is the best kind!<br /><br />We couldn't keep from gasping with laughter as they showed us this book of  quasi-serious cartoon drawing, illustrating the ludicrous concept of massaging the generally loosely constructed lump of flesh that is a feline. If you aren't a cat owner, you may not \\"get\\" the joke; cats need a massage like I need a banana split. Mine lies around on his back and looks like he's a pool of melting furry caramel sauce.<br /><br />Of course, your cat may actually need to be massaged, but then, who doesn't?<br /><br />Funny stuff, indeed.	2002-08-02

Author Evans does give the reader a sort of literary &quot;slide show&quot;  through some of Southern Africa's most lovely sights, but she wrote the book for the purpose of combining her favorite places with help for meditating.  Her meditation involves the Indian Chakra system, which can be represented as seven areas on the body from tip of the spine to over the top of the head. Each Chakra (wheel) is associated with a color, physiological system, and psychological balance. For example the first chakra is associated with the color red, can be characterized as &quot;holding&quot; or &quot;containing&quot; and when balanced, is living &quot;with&quot; nature, not trying to dominate or control it. There's a lot more to it, and that isn't in this book. This is a short, sweetly written book with nature imagery to help your inner visualization.<br />The Chakra system may be foreign to some readers--but it is another way of looking at the interconnectivity of the physical, the emotional and the spiritual world, that triune system that makes up our selves and how we fit into the world. It is related to the Chinese Traditional Medicine system of Earth-Wind-Fire-Metal-Water, and the Christian mind-body-soul. If you are not open to alternative philosophies, the Chakra parts of this book will be lost on you. So if you eschew New Age anything, you will not enjoy this book. While I have a lot of doubts about most New Age philosophies, the Hindu Chakra system interests me greatly in how it relates to Western philosophy and other Eastern disciplines, such as the Chinese as previously mentioned.<br />If you paint as a form of meditation, there is another book that makes a good companion for this; &quot;Making Pearls&quot; by Jeanne Carbonetti.  Gail Evan's &quot;Meditations&quot; is very, very helpful in using the &quot;Making Pearls&quot; book by Carbonetti, which has you do a 7-painting series based on chakras to find your creative center.  I was having difficulty understanding the chakra colors I was supposed to paint. Now I have a guide to expand on them and I will complete my series of paintings (strangely enough, I got this book right after I decided to do a chakra painting series--a pleasant instance of synchronicity.)

The author Richard Lederer says that he believes &quot;that my Bride is the best written of my four Anguished English books.&quot;  I totally agree.  &quot;Bride&quot; is a fantastic faux-pastiche of verbal blunders, a written equivalent to a whole season of TV's Best Bloopers plus America's Dumbest Home Videos.<br />Aside from its amusement value, &quot;Bride&quot; is also handy for English teachers and anyone wishing to improve their writing skills. Selected gems from the book can illustrate WHY you need to be careful about dangling participles, careless spelling and mixed metaphors. It's one thing to hold forth on the value of good English grammar, it's another to gaze with horrified astonishment at actual printed headlines such as:<br />  &quot;WOMAN BORN FEBRUARY 29 HAS BABY SAME DAY&quot;<br />  and<br />  &quot;AIRLINE EXPECTS TO BE BACK ON TRACK BY WEEKEND&quot;<br />These illustrations are far more impressive than memorizing lists of rules or reading &quot;Elements of Style.&quot; If you want to brush up your writing skills, it couldn't hurt to have a laugh and also pick up some examples of really bad mistakes you are sure to remember.<br />There is plenty more good stuff here--including the chapter on stupid headlines, a chapter of the particularly dumb stuff doctors and lawyers write (always rewarding if you like to needle professionals at parties, lots and lots of lawyer jokes here) and the divine comedy from church and Sunday School that informs you that &quot;Amen&quot; really means...&quot;Tha-tha-tha-that's all, folks!&quot;<br />I sure hope that's not all...we could all use some more Anguish like this.

Back then, it was unpopular, if not downright dangerous, to be a labor agitator and Commie in Detroit. But what Herman's dad didn't know, or didn't care to see, was that it could be fatal to live in Stalin's Russia.<br />During the crazed time of the purges, Victor Herman found himself suddenly dropped as star athlete and pet American Communist youth when he was swept away into one of the many prison camps (gulags) that were strung across the Russian landscape in what Nobel Prize author Solzhenitsyn referred to as The Gulag Archipelago. Solzhenitsyn's novel &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; outlined in spare, horrific terms, the near-animal existence in that cruel environment.<br />Herman's own tale parallels everything in &quot;Ivan Denisovich&quot; and adds the attendant horror of gambling-for-body-parts (tasty snacks for the winner) and living on corpse-fed rats. Herman's life once he was released from the gulag was hardly better, living in an ice &quot;chop-out&quot; in the permafrost of Siberia.<br />This book perhaps sheds some light on current events in the former Soviet Union, when you wonder what happened to the former inmates of the prison camps. This is a story that deserves to be preserved, and it is a shame it is no longer in print.	2002-07-24

One of Heinlein's best novels	The setting of &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; is the Moon, which is Earth's penal colony in 2076, something along the lines of Australia.  Transportees get a one-way trip for vagrancy, juvenile deliquency, criminal activity or just being in the way in over-populated areas. Other choose to freely emigrate, a permanent decision, as the muscle atrophy that occurs in the low gravity make re-establishing a life on Earth difficult. The Warden presides over the colony, he is a political appointee (and one would imagine, a previously powerful pol who found himself on the wrong side of the aisle at one point and won himself a permanent sinecure.)<br />The people on Luna are free to do what they want; there are no laws except mandates set down by the Warden. And in this environment, a libertarian society has evolved. Politeness and caution in dealing with others is a valued trait because unpleasant &quot;chums&quot; can be eliminated with no questions asked. Instead of being ruled by gangs or a mafia, the Moon has become a very free and pleasant place to live, that is, if you understand the principle of TANSTAAFL, or &quot;there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.&quot;<br />Women are scarce (as one would expect, fewer are transported than men.) Instead of being chattel to men, women are prized, and polyandrous marriages are common (mulitple husbands, one woman.) But all is not well in this airless paradise; someone has figured out that Luna is in trouble. Water is running out, and no one seems to care.<br />Against this backdrop, a motley cabal forms to rebel against the careless authority and set up a Free Luna. The characters are smart, lovable and entertaining; a jack-of-trades, a beautiful blonde, a crusty professor and... a sentient computer with a warped sense of humor. The revolution begins, and if you haven't read this book, you are in for a real treat. The struggle is exciting and the end, well, I cried and maybe you will too.

I was particularly susceptible to her advice because, if nothing else, I want my sink clean, ... and that goes for drying it out afterwards with a towel. But of course, cleaning the sink is just the baby step to getting a grip on the chaos at home.<br />Some of the baby steps on the way to Chaos-Control include setting up various routines. This is effective if you do them for two weeks at the least because that is how long it takes to establish a new habit. Some of the routines include a bedtime routine that may be a bit over-ambitious for some of us, but who says you need to do the entire list:<br />  1 Pick up and put away stuff in living room<br />  2.Clean up kitchen, including polishing that sacred sink<br />  3.Pick up any hot spots (the places clutter likes to roost)<br />  4.Make a list of tomorrow's tasks.<br />  5.Check calendar for appointments<br />  6.Do anything tonight that you can, like lunches<br />  7.Put things you need to take with you by the door. ...more<br />this list goes on and that's just bed time. But you get the picture.<br />I would recommend this book especially for anyone who is partially or wholly disabled (as I write this, I have a cast on my broken leg, so I know what I'm talking about here.) Getting around if you are disabled is a real chore; clutter in the way means at the very least difficulty in getting by, and can lead to a more serious accident. Also, you need a system to keep things to hand--you can't just jump up and run over to them.  I don't think you have to copy FlyLady's entire method, but surely using some of it and building up to your own system is better than hunting for clean underwear in the tool box.	2002-07-19

First, I adore Paris and love the art of French cooking. I learned French style cooking years ago and I love to watch how my French friends put together a seemingly simple meal that turns out so impressively. And the black-and-white photos of Paris that illustrate the book are great reminders of visits past.<br />The key to these seemingly simple recipes in &quot;The Paris Cookbook&quot; is good ingredients, a knack for combination, some fundamental traditional ideas, and a passion for excellence. For example, some of the most interesting recipes to me were for peasant cooking from Provence. There was a soup of spelt (a wheat-like grain with many healthful properties.) It was combined with barley and the green French de Puy lentils to make a Mediterranean-style meal-in-a-pot soup. The use of spelt is more common in Germany --however the Provencal use it as one would use rice, in risottos or as here, in a soup. There is also a recipe for a simple version of bouillabaise fish soup that I really want to try.<br />The other recipe that got me excited was for an ordinary gazpacho cold tomato soup but...with a savory mustard ice cream as a garnish. Now THERE'S an interesting idea. If you have ever had a blob of cream in a tomato-based soup, you know how nicely cream blends and smooths the flavor of the acid fruit. But to add the cream in the form of ice cream, but unsweetened and with a spicy mustard, now that is exciting! I will be making that for my next summer dinner party. I also got the idea to modify the recipe and make wasabi green tea ice cream (wasabi is the green Japanese mustard you get with sushi.) I can pair that with a cold cucumber-crab soup.<br />That's what I adore about this cookbook. Not only great recipes, but they are in essence, fundamental and can be adapted with your own creative ideas.<br />The author also includes information about each restaurant where she obtained the recipes--chef, address, notes. So if you go to Paris, you essentially have quite a good restaurant guide.<br />The only caveat about this cookbook is that to make any of these recipes, you must get top-quality ingredients, as they are the backbone of each dish. This means a trek to the farmer's market, to the specialty shop, the farm, your backyard garden, the dairy or mail-order as many grocery store items will just not measure up. I can tell you from experience that the quality of the ingredients is paramount to success, and grocery store cream and butter in most of the US just can't do the job. And don't get me started on the vegetables.you go to Paris, you essentially have quite a good restaurant guide. <br />The only caveat about this cookbook is that to make any of these recipes, you must get top-quality ingredients, as they are the backbone of each dish.

I like to group his novels into three general categories. They are:<br />1. \\"Youth\\" novels such as the excellent \\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\", \\"Tunnel in the Sky\\" and \\"Podkayne of Mars.\\" These feature young heroes or heroines in challenging situations.<br /><br />2. \\"Future History\\" novels, such as \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\",\\"Time Enough for Love\\", \\"Methuselah's Children\\", \\"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\\" and \\"Friday.\\"<br /><br />3. Novels with metaphysical or philosophical leanings such as \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" and \\"Starship Troopers.\\"<br /><br />You could put \\"Starship Troopers\\" in the category of a youth novels. Rico, the young hero of the novel is barely out of high school when he volunteers for military service in order to win citizenship privileges--and impress pretty fellow student Carmen. She's volunteering for service, hoping her mathematics talent will gain her a pilot's seat.<br /><br />Wait! Citizenship privileges--what's that? Aren't we all endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the vote? Well, not in John Rico's world. There, citizenship is earned by military service, and it isn't all flowers and pancakes, either. If war breaks out, your short stint becomes...indefinite.<br /><br />So why would anyone risk life and limb, plus some very unpleasant times in boot camp, just to be able to vote? That's the philosophical underpinning of \\"Starship Troopers.\\" Heinlein creates a republic based on a sort of responsible freedom, where liberty is granted, but the right to direct it is earned by those who paid in a stake.<br /><br />So, is this book a boring political rant? Heck no! In amongst the lectures on liberty and good government a la Heinlein is an incredibly action-packed adventure. The Bugs are an alien race bent on destroying the Earth. And Earth armies have little idea how to stop them except they know they must do so to survive.<br />The scenes in boot camp are gripping. The battle scenes are realistic.

A treat for lovers of architecture	I bought this book thinking it was about rendering architectural subjects for watercolorists. It is not, so I was disappointed in that respect. But I was not disappointed in the artwork included in what is really a book intended for architects and admirerers of their work.<br />The drawings and paintings of buildings of all kinds can take your breath away. There are some projects of great magnificence (the proposed Arts and Cultural Center in Rome on the cover is one in particular.) There is a section on different mediums such as ink line and wash, pastel and charcoal, standard watercolor. There is a historical perspective section that includes classic paintings of John Singer Sargent and Winslow Homer. In particular, there is a picture of Sargent's of a doorway on a canal in Venice that is familiar--yet set in this book it gives a new insight into how artists can show architecture for not only the features of a facade, but with style. The purely architectural works are more finely drawn and less \\"painterly\\" but they are amazing in their own right. My favorite is a picture of the addition to the Jewish Museum in New York, which combines artistic feeling with an informational slant, showing what a modern addition would look like added to the noble French Mansard style original building.<br />While this book wasn't what I needed for technique, I had a wonderful time drooling over the pages at some really wonderful architectural renderings in watercolor, ink and pencil. A real visual treat.	2002-07-10

Yes, it is gimmicky: it is a 3\\"x3x4\\" BLOCK (get it?) of 672 thick pages. They aren't numbered and there is no table of contents. That's by design. The author, Jason Rekulak intends for you to use these little exercises almost at random. I found I was very stimulated by flipping through the pages-- I started writing the exercise in my head almost as soon as I had read it. The assignments make you focus your mind with great clarity on a single point.<br />Here's an example of one of the exercises: \\"There are 30,000 Americans who drink more than 10 cups of coffee per day. Write a story about one of them.\\" I think the author's name makes a 673rd bonus exercise that I am adding here: \\"Write a science fiction story with an alien creature named Rekulak.\\" (Sorry, Jason, but you got my imagination going!)<br /><br />Some of the assignments are geared to creative or fictional writing and others towards reportage or memoir. I love that--it's a bit like Forrest Gump's box of chocolates. Since the pages aren't numbered, and the thickness of the book makes it hard to spread open, I use Post-It(tm) flags to mark any I think I want to go back to. But it's probably better to use the book like that box of chocolates and just take the vanilla cream along with the toffee that sticks to your dental work. If you do one of these every day, in two years, who knows what you will be writing? I intend to find out.	2002-07-10

I've actually watched birds my entire life from the day my mom told me I could catch a bird if I put salt on its tail and she caught me running out of the house with the salt shaker, chasing after a blackbird. (I'm not making this up.) This book is one of my key tools I use to convert friends and family into bird-o-maniacs. I begin with the provocative remark &quot;Did you know I've recorded over 40 species of birds in our suburban back yard,&quot; then I take them out to watch birds at a national preserve nearby. Works every time.<br />I love the drawings because they give you the average or highlighted characteristic feature of the species. Photos can obscure, although sometimes they are indispensible to make a tough identification. The new edition has a wonderful feature: the range maps are now WITH the bird species and not in the back. Hooray! Range is critical to bird identification--if you think you are seeing a Western Jay and you are in Delaware, well, maybe it is an accidental but probably you saw some other kind of bird. The notes on songs help you identify that unseen bird, and the description of habits is essential.<br />I suggest if you have kids, that you get a reasonable pair of binoculars, this Field Guide and a set of index cards, a scrap book, a weblog or just use the life-checklist in the book. Have the kids note the species they see, when and where they see them. Soon they will have a fascinating list of what's in their own backyard and you will have something wonderful to do together.	2002-07-06

The novel centers around the Cantwell family, notably daughter Nan.<br /><br />Papa Cantwell owns a (blush) corset factory. But ladies are turning from steel-belted, all-weather laced corsets to rubberized, comfortable (well, relatively comfortable) models. Mr. Cantwell is as inflexible as his corsets and seeks to contour the past as tightly as cinched waists. Modernize? Not he! And there are predictable consequences to his business. He's a boor and a brute. His wife is a typical genteel booby, drifing along or actually drifting downwards with her husband. She's hapless against the tides of ruin that are washing up on their middle-class conventional life. She goes to the hairdresser, neglects the housekeeping and the kids.<br /><br />Nan does well in school and tries to make sense of the increasing disorder in the family. For Mr. Cantwell, it would seem, has a past, a past that comes back in the shape of a bundle of letters written in spindly green ink. Nan's coming-of-age as a woman is shot through with the sins of the adults in her life. Truly, the sins of the fathers are in this case, visited on the children. She notes that &#34;grownups get money for nothing.&#34; and that they take advantage of the weak, even children, whenever they can. The &#34;nothing&#34; is of course, not &#34;nothing&#34;, and Nan finds out about the facts of life a bit too late as always.<br /><br />This is a fine, fine first novel and really has only the flaw of being over-ambitious and a bit exotic. The events are crammed in, doubtless from the author's incredible creativity and observant eye and ear. First novels sometimes are a bit over-stuffed, and despite the fact this is not a long book, it is very packed with events, characters, and imagery. But this is a minor literary criticism. This is a wonderful book to read, and if you can find a copy of it, do so. You will probably enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />I'm comparing &#34;Holy Pictures&#34; to Angela's Ashes (which was a memoir.) So the comparison is only that Boylan writes of tough times growing up in Ireland, and that the protagonist is a bright, worthy character surrounded by less-than-sterling adults. There, the comparison ends. But if you liked Angela's Ashes, you will very probably like &#34;Holy Pictures.&#34;.  I'm comparing &#34;Holy Pictures&#34; to Angela's Ashes (which was a memoir.)

Author Mary Kelly and Fabrice Moireau teamed up to make the most delicious book on Paris that I have seen yet. Yes, I exclaimed &quot;Ooo-la-la&quot; when I opened this to a random page, but forgive me for the cliche. This book is magnificient in every way.<br />I first travelled to Paris in 1976, then a number of times thereafter, lately last May 2001. Each time, I strive to capture the essence of this wonderful city, and aside from a few character sketches, I don't have much success. This book is everything I wanted to take back from Paris in addition to some wonderful memories.<br />The format is a longer-than-wide book with excellent paper. The text is accompanied by good-sized watercolors and pencilled notes. It looks as if you are holding the actual sketchbook. The colors are very true; I do watercolors myself and I can tell you that the pages look as if the washes were just laid down. The look is fresh and really, it is stunning.<br />If you love France, Paris, art, watercolors, travel, you will love this book. I treasure it.	2002-07-05

It was just as the Viet Nam War was rising to its shocking crest, people were rioting in the streets, the young were questioning everything and rebelling, the draft was taking older brothers and friends, and it was a very crazy time. We asked the teacher who selected the novel and who had served in World War II \\"Is this an accurate representation of the madness of war?\\" He replied that, in his experience, it was.<br />After recently re-reading Heller's novel, I realized that this book wasn't, as we had studied it, just about the madness of war. Sure, that was foremost on our minds at the time the book was published. But Heller really caught the moral dilemma of an individual caught up in the mob hysteria of war, where the rules of civilization and laws are temporarily and deliberately suspended by the authorities.<br /><br />The key paragraph, for me, is: \\"Man was matter, that was Snowden's secret. Drop him out a window and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot, like other kinds of garbage. That was Snowden's secret. Ripeness was all.\\" In other words, Man is no more than meat and bone EXCEPT for a brief period when he is alive...and if he does something to preserve his soul. This is deep and perceptive.<br /><br />At the end of \\"Catch-22\\", Yossarian is faced with a tempting choice. He has, however, learned something from the horrors and insanity. His decision takes into account not only his personal safety, but goes beyond to the greater good. He has risen.<br /><br />For that reason, \\"Catch-22\\" is more than just an amusing novel, a bestseller and the novel that gave birth to M*A*SH*. Yossarian's moral dilemma is one each of us must ponder, whenever we choose to go to war. I think this is one of the best 100 American novels	2002-07-03

Campbell, editor of the sci-fi magazine &quot;Analog&quot; coined the term &quot;future history&quot; about the chain of characters and stories written by Robert A. Heinlein. It's a brilliant term, because Heinlein literally created a fictional history of an entire people, from Earth, to early space travel, to settling the moon, to moving out among the stars.<br />This book, astonishingly out of print, contains many of Heinlein's best short stories and novellas, filling in the gaps for his major novels such as &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; and &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.&quot;<br />Heinlein apparently kept a complicated character-and-time chart in his study. This book has a copy of the chart, plus the award-winning stories and short fiction.<br />Included here: &quot;Methuselah's Children&quot;--the beginning of the story of the Howard Families that is taken up in the sweeping novel &quot;Time Enough for Love.&quot; You'll also find stories that explain the founding of Luna City, pioneering space travel, and the revolution against the theocracy begun by Nehemiah Scudder.<br />If you are a Heinlein fan, this is a great book to have--fills out the gaps in his complete works. If you aren't a Heinlein fan, start with &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; or &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; to find out how great Heinlein's science fiction is.	2002-07-01

Annie McGairy has a lot in common with Francie Nolan of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; and even more with Betty Smith, the author. This is more autobiographical novelization, this time, chronicling Annie's move west and her marriage to Carl at a young age.<br />While Carl studies law at a big Midwestern university, Annie must cope with the changes marriage brings, plus the stress of little money and a burning desire to get an education. Annie's solution is to camp outside a classroom at the university and listen in. The events that follow are, indeed, joyous.<br />Some readers find that &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; is less enjoyable than &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.&quot; Some of this may be due to the fact that &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; is a novel about a transitional time in the author's life.  Novels and autobiographies that deal with times of change and transition are often less &quot;jelled&quot; than ones about childhood. I sometimes compare &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; with &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; by McCourt. &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; shares some qualities with McCourt's sequel &quot;T'is&quot; for the same reasons--it's that time of growth and transition. If you keep that in mind, it explains the difference in quality from the previous work.<br />I had the amusing experience of reading &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; for the first time while I was attending a big midwestern university myself. When Smith began describing the campus and the classroom in the novel, I could clearly visualize all the locations she wrote about. I began to have my suspicions and ran to the library to look up Smith's biography. Yes, she was writing about University of Michigan, where I was going to school at the time.	2002-06-21

It's wonderful that Betty Smith's classic &#34;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&#34; is still being read enthusiastically.<br />Betty Smith's character Francie Nolan is autobiographical. The detail with which Smith recreates life in a poor section of Brooklyn is memorable and meticulous: the small details such as  dinner after dinner of fried eggs with onions (eggs and onions being what the family could afford) are reminscent of &#34;Angela's Ashes.&#34;  Francie is spirited, bright and unquenchable and it's this spirit that has inspired young readers for decades.<br /><br />Smith was able to write autobiographically while fictionalizing the events sufficiently to create a novel. This is a marvelous writing. I enjoyed reading it again to study the skill with which Smith blended the ability to recreate her past in detail, yet keep the writing spare and fresh. This is great fiction.	2002-06-21

We use Excel extensively at work, but I always found using formulas in Excel to be much more difficult than, say, Quattro Pro or Lotus 1-2-3. Well, with this book in hand, I got farther in an hour than I have in months of haphazardly using Excel and the (hmm) help files. This book is NOT just about formulae--there is excellent background on Excel and a good introduction to some of the most central features, such as multiple worksheets and data entry tips.<br />Excel is a powerful program and though you can set up a simple spreadsheet with little or no training, using the deeper functions becomes a bit complicated. This book helps you dip into more of the things Excel can do and which frankly are not well explained by the manual or the help files.<br />We do a lot of charts and forecasts. I found the chapter on charting helpful. I also found a bunch of tips and tricks on naming cells that I hadn't used before (for example, I've named cells for charts but never for variables in a formula.)<br />Having examples of formulae also saves a lot of time. Maybe the formula is not exactly one you need, but having one to start from sure helps.<br />This book is a fantastic tutorial and really expanded my knowledge of Excel quickly. What's interesting about this book is that it also includes a history of Excel, starting with VisiCalc. I used VisiCalc when it first came out--and spreadsheets revolutionized what you could do on the earliest of PC's. The history section is wonderful reading --a nice thing to see in what could have been a dry subject.

Many of Verne's novels have become cultural icons for Americans  though Verne was French and we read him in translation. Nevertheless, his philosophy that enlightened good will and scientific advancement would save society is so close to American idealism, he seems much more American than almost any of his contemporaries.<br /><br />Everyone is familiar with Around the World in 80 Days and 20,000 Leagues. For some reason, The Mysterious Island is not read as widely. Yet, in my opinion, it is Verne's best and most rewarding novel.<br /><br />The opening of Myserious Island reads a bit like a serious version of \\"Wizard of Oz.\\" Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top make a daring escape from a Civil War prison in a balloon, but the balloon is blown way off course to an uncharted volcanic island. These men are worthy souls; Captain Cyrus is an inspiring leader, Pencroft, an earthy but hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a \\"everyman\\" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving, and Herbert a young, knowlegeable naturalist. These men and their dog Top conquer the island's challenges and make the very best out of their isolation on the small island. But are they prepared for the surprises the island has for them--and the ultimate surprise in the second half of the book. The suspense keeps the reader turning the pages through a great deal of descriptive information about nature, chemistry, physics and engineering. This is classic Verne and what really put the Science in Science Fiction.<br /><br />One reason Mysterious Island may not have developed the strong audience of the other Verne novels is that there is so much detail and scientific discussion. That is rough going if you have little interest in such subjects. There are abridged versions that cut a lot of the description, but frankly, the science is what I love best about the book. How Cyrus and company make nitroglycerin and use it to reshape their island home is one of my favorite chapters in sci-fi literature.<br /><br />If you liked Swiss Family Robinson as a child, you would surely enjoy Mysterious Island. It's one of Verne's best works and deserves to be read..     If you liked Swiss Family Robinson as a child, you would surely enjoy Mysterious Island.

Typical of historical fiction, there is plenty of bloody sword fighting, and a good deal of hearty romance as well. But this is no \\"bodice-buster.\\"  Author Randoph attempts to recreate the sense of the language as well as tell the story of Ceridwen.

This magazine, which deals with cuisine and travel, offers some of the best prose outside of literary magazines like the New Yorker or Atlantic Monthly.<br />I already am a fan of M.F.K. Fisher (who isn't?), Paul Theroux and Laurie Colwin. But there are many other authors here whose work I wasn't as familiar with. I was very very glad to read Mary Cantwell and William Hamilton in particular.<br />If you love travel and food, this book is sure to appeal to you. But these authors are SO good that really, this book is about  how we react to the most basic of activities, eating and drinking and how they are inextricably mixed with our emotions and memories.<br />The list of authors reads like a literary prize list, not only those authors I previously mentioned, but Anita Loos and E. Annie Proulx as well. The essays may deal with eating and drinking in some way, but each of the authors has a very unique way of dealing with the subject. In particular, I loved the story by  William Hamilton. His childhood memory where he was promised a mysteriously alluring treat  &quot;jellied consomme&quot;  is one that recreates childhood emotions with uncanny accuracy and a lot of wry humor.<br />I happen to be a fan of the publisher, Modern Library. I love their compact format, and the typeface clear and readable. If you love good writing, this book is a real treat.	2002-06-06

Here's why:<br />1. The technique of using two circulars to knit a sock in the round is easy to do, but rather hard to explain. Author Bordi does this with clear pictures and great step-by-step explanations. I was totally flummoxed by this technique until I read her book.<br />2. Knitting on two circulars rather than 4 double-points results in a smoother gauge. This is especially important for colorwork knitting.<br />3. The pictures are clear and show some beautiful technique. The cover is in color, and the photos inside are a very good gray tone that shows detail.  The patterns are endlessly adaptable, using them as a template with your own colorwork or textured knitting designs.<br />4. There isn't just technique in this book. Bordi has a number of really lovely patterns including some textured work, color work and picture knitting.  Charts are large and easy to read. Only the leaf-and-tendril is not charted (it's row by row.)<br />5. Here's a list of the sock patterns:<br />a. Simple Sock in three Sizes (easy)<br />b. Indoor Felted Boot (easy)<br />c. Gardener sock (easy)<br />d. Columbine Peak (intermediate, textured)<br />e. Two Alert Cats (intermediate, cat chart really useful!)<br />f. Cable Top (intermediate)<br />g. Alpine Meadow (intermediate, nice colorwork)<br />h. Bavarian Twisted Stitch (intermediate, lovely textured)<br />i. Leaf and Tendril (textured, advanced.)<br />j. Not mentioned in the contents, but there is a &quot;fleet foot&quot; sock with a design like Mercury's wings on the cuff.<br />There are only 44 pages in this book, which makes it seem a bit pricey, but every page is loaded with content. This is a book with NO fluff that I know I will be referring to, again and again. (Well, actually there IS some fluff--one pattern incorporates yarn made of an angora-like fiber spun from dog fur. It's pretty fluffy!)<br />Bordi mentions that when she teaches classes, the knitters sigh over two of the sock patterns-- the leaf-and-trellis and the alpine meadow. I had the same reaction when I saw them in this book.

I used to visit New England sheep farms every year on a Wool Day tour that took you from farm to farm in New Hampshire. It was so wonderful. So I had to take a look at Candace Strick's tribute to New England Sheep Farns.<br />Handdyed country wools are used beautifully in this book to make 26 designs. But WHY I bought this book is due to one sweater alone, an indigo and natural design that has a pattern that combines both an Escher like mosaic with a Japanese or Islamic looking pattern. The patterns uses two variants of one motif, one with an added dark band. The use of two similar small patterns makes an overall larger design that is incredibly pleasing.<br />There are the usual picture sweaters here. The notes about the farms are fun to read if you love New England (ok, so I am homesick a bit.) All in all, a beautiful book with sweaters that would make elegant gifts.	2002-05-13

Visually, I found it left a lot to be desired. But if you look past the cosmetics, there is a wealth of information here on FORM and FIT detail that is unique and useful.<br />Examples: there is a lot of attention to construction. So much so that two sports bra patterns are given. The directional knitting is interesting and fitting such a knitting garment is no mean trick.<br />While some of the other items may look boring, good simple patterns that can be knit in a fine yarn for evening (cardijackets for example) are valuable. Maybe you won't be knitting a dress or a bra, but this book will teach you about construction and fit in a way no other knitting book can.	2002-05-13

Fitness for combating middle-age	Why, oh, why, do we blimp out after 30? Even when I was active, lifting weights and exercising regularly, I still found I gained weight steadily after 35 years old? Is it just in our genes?<br />Author Phil Campbell reveals some interesting scientific findings here, and he provides practical 3 to 5 hour a week work outs designed to combat middle age spread. The cover picture is of the author who looks rather like a super-fit version of former President Clinton. It certainly seems to work for him--and he is fifty.<br />Campbell discusses how growth hormone, banned from drug-free athletic competition, is responsible for keeping that middle-age spread at bay. But short of illegal injections in Mexico, what can a middle-aged person do to boost their growth hormone naturally and reap the fitness benefits?<br />New medical discoveries show that you can significantly increase GH naturally. Very specific forms of exercise, some nutritional supplements, and adequate sleep, will increase levels of the hormone naturally, even in older people.<br />Some interesting findings are that eating properly before and after exercise can either boost or inhibit growth hormone. For example, if you eat a Big Mac, fries and then go work out, and two hours afterwards, down the supersized coke or drink Gatorade, you can kiss results goodbye. The combination of high fat before and high sugar after exercise prevent the release of tiny amounts of growth hormone, which puts on muscle and improves athletic performance.<br />The exercise programs here range from about 3.5 hours for beginners up to 5 hours for enthusiasts. But at first blush, the workouts seem excessively technical. They range from aerobics, to \\"plyometrics\\" which are exercises that boost fast-twitch muscle--the muscle type that fades away with age. And then there are weights. The book shows Mr. Campbell tossing javelins, doing karate kicks (another of his areas of expertise), bounding and otherwise flying about. This can be discouraging if you are a couch potato, but dream of being fit (me, for example.)<br />The \\"Strategic Fitness Plans\\" are five different fitness levels- based on your age, your current fitness status, and training experience.  If you intend to follow this program, you should visit your physician first if you are tremendously out of shape. Some of the exercises here can get you hurt if you don't go at them correctly (the bounding can whack your ankles.) And a personal trainer, if available, would be a real asset.  There is a lot here--flexibility, fast movement (sprinting, fast cycling), weights and more. It seems complicated at first, but a complete exercise program should at least contain stretching, aerobics and weights, so here you are adding the fast-twitch stimulating exercises to combat that middle-age metabolic monster.<br />If you are SERIOUS about wanting to beat aging and get or stay in the best shape, and are noticing that age is beginning to take a toll, this book could be very helpful. I predict Campbells<br />s book will become the next exercise fad best-seller.uraging if you are a couch potato, but dream of being fit (me, for example.)<br />The \\"Strategic Fitness Plans\\" are five different fitness levels- based on your age, your current fitness status, and training experience.

Encouraged by this cookbook, we bought a haggis at a shop in the Edinburgh airport. We transported this frozen cannonball home, cooked it according to directions and made the tatties and neeps as presented here.<br />We also bravely invited guests. As we plunged the knife into the heart (literally) of the haggis, its compact contours exploded into an amazing amount of what looked like steaming cooked chopped meat. It tasted divine, and there wasn't any left.<br />It's a good thing this cookbook has plastic-coated pages, because an exploding haggis could really damage a regular book. Of course Scottish cooking isn't just about haggis; there's a lot of salmon and many notable soups. I recommend the Dundee cake recipe. If you want to serve a fruit cake at Christmas that will delight and not disgust your guest, Dundee cake is for you.<br />Why the Scots can cook and the British cannot remains a mystery. But don't even think of making a haggis at home. One set of instructions I read had you put the lungs into a pot of boiling water and hang the trachea outside the pot, draining into a cup to collect...whatever. Stick with the salmon or cockaleekie and you will be all right.	2002-05-07

But if you've been in a corporate environment, you probably know these facts from corporate training courses, and need more depth of information. For example, if you are firing an employee, there are things that you must do in a corporate setting that are more complicated and structured, due to the corporate guidelines you have to follow.<br />What's really great about Blencoe's book is that it can be grasped by anyone and the techniques apply across any industry, whether it is fast food, an auto body shop, or a small computer store. This book should be on the shelf of every small business owner to give to the managers. So many family owned companies and small companies \\"just grow\\" and fail to provide good management training. The resulting dissatisfaction and employee problems cost these businesses a great deal. This book is cheap medicine and should be required reading.	2002-05-02

Four fine novels	While Frank Herbert is justly famous for the Dune series of novels, which are some of the greatest science fiction ever written, he also wrote a number of other shorter novels.<br /><br />The four included here have odd titles: Whipping Star, The Dosadi Experiment, The Santaroga Barriet and Soul Catcher.<br /><br />Whipping Star has a strange concept: Calabans, strange, communicative but confusing creatures have given star gates (called S'Eyes) to the galaxy. But they are disappearing amid waves of madness and death. One Caliban is left, and has been hired by the world's richest and kinkiest woman to be flogged. How do you flog an energy being? Jorg X McKie must communicate with the cryptic Calaban and find the connection between the whippings and the disappearance of the other Calabans and a threat to the entire world.<br /><br />The Dosadi Experiment brings McKie back again, this time to find out the secret of a Gowachin (froglike sentient being) experiment on the brutal and toxic planet Dosadi. The Gowachin seek to control McKie and manipulate the Dosadi situation, but McKie makes some unexpected moves.<br /><br />In The Santaroga Barrier, psychologist Gilbert Dasein is sent to Santaroga in Northern California. Why has every company that set down a chain store in Santaroga failed to succeed? Why did previous investigators die in seemingly innocent and coincidental accidents? Dasein finds out much more than anyone ever else did, but can he ultimately escape Santaroga?<br /><br />The Soul Catcher is set in contemporary times, and is the story of a native American who undergoes a frightening transformation as Katsuk, the avenging spirit who purifies the world. Is it madness or is it the spirit world intruding into modern reality?<br /><br />All four are different novels, and quite different from Dune. All four are some of the best non-Dune writing Herbert ever did.	2002-05-02

The sheer imagination and wealth of language makes these books very appealing. What's even more impressive is that they apparently translate well into other languages. My German friends are very enthusiastic about Harry Potter \\"auf Deutsch\\" and that is a testament to the superb storytelling ability of the author.<br /><br />There is some gross stuff in this volume: the \\"Deathday Party\\" for Nearly Headless Nick is none too savory (Nick is a ghost who had a botched beheading and now is socially an embarrasing rung below the well-guillotined.) The refreshments at the party are pretty disgusting. Of course, that appeals to kids, who love the sensational and thrilling, and yes, the gross.<br /><br />I'm going to gloss over the controversy over whether these books glorify Paganism and witchcraft. Any fairytale in the last two centuries has a lot of this kind of thing, so if you are going to read a fairytale, that's the kind of stuff that's in there.<br /><br />As a study for how to write a classic fantasy tale, you can't get a better example than Rowling's works. I'd put her up there with Tolkein for creating a fantasy world.	2002-04-28

Therefore, the book is a bit uneven, as it is comprised of letters, journal entries and finished pieces of writing as well.<br /> The writing dates back to the point where her marriage to Al Fisher begins to dissolve, covers her meeting Timmy (aka \\"Chexbres\\" aka Dillwin Parrish)--her beloved second husband. She and Timmy had only a few years together before his devastating death. Fisher deals here more closely with Parrish's untimely death, but even so, there is a large whole around the event. She claimed she was a shadow of herself after Parrish died. Maybe so, but she lead a long and productive life up until her death at age 84 in 1992.<br />We are treated to some of the best prose Fisher could muster in this book, along with her journal musings and letters (from Mayo Clinic, where Parrish vainly sought treatment.) The journals and letters are revealing--this is how Fisher processed her thoughts on the way to writing some of the best biographical prose ever.<br />One biographical sketch in the book, about a meeting with an old friend and her lesbian lover in soon-to-be-Nazi-occupied Paris is exceptional. How Fisher manages to telegraph what is going to happen before she actually writes the sentence always floors me. Her deft use of a few short words to warn, to forbode are always amazing. It could be compared to Lillian Hellman's writing (Pentimento, for example) but is so much better. As Mary MacCarthy points out, you have to have truth in your writing and no one handled the painful truth better than Fisher.	2002-03-25

If you haven't considered the impact of the plague on history consider this: in 1630, the plague wiped out most of the population of Milan, decimating it from a city of about 250,000 to 60,000 souls. (Interestingly, cloistered nuns were among those who survived, having been efffectively quarantined. They preserved a great deal of the cultural knowledge that was passed down.)<br />Now, what if the plague had wiped out 99% of Europeans, and in their place, the Asian empires became the dominant culture of Earth? Kim Stanley Robinson examines this horrifying and alluring hypothesis.<br /><br />One challenge the author dealt with was the great span of time the novel encompasses--700 years. He treats each chapter as a novella, and this is perhaps what makes Years of Rice and Salt so successful; the novella, handled well, is one of science fiction's best genres. The novel gives thought to the question &#34;Would we get a utopia instead of what we DID get, if Europe had been erased from history?&#34; Interesting question!<br /><br />In Robinson's vision, the world is turned topsy-turvy; colonization happened from Asia instead of Europe, so the New World was settled from west to east, not east to west. The dominant religions are Islam and Buddhism; Christianity is relegated to a historical footnote. The great science of India is not forgotten as it is today, but comes to full flower. Dynasties that never were rise and fall. What a marvelous canvas for a novel!	2002-03-14

It has lasted longer on the shelves than many other books of its kind and packs an influential punch.<br />The secret of &quot;Diet for a Small Planet&quot; is that it contains something for everyone, whether you believe in vegetarianism, the ecological production of the food supply or just want better health.<br />If you are an animal activist or don't eat meat for religious reasons, Lappe provides valuable info on how to get the proper balance in your diet by matching foods to get all the essential amino acids you need (the building blocks of proteins.)<br />If you are interested in health, you can use Lappe's book to provide alternative main dishes that are satisfying and lower in fat, higher in fiber. Meat is a major source of saturated fats, beans and rice and other grains provide lots of benefits such as soluable and insoluable fiber, vitamins and minerals.<br />If you are ecologically minded, and this is the thrust of the book, you can eat comfortably, knowing your dietary items take up less resources to grow.<br />I don't subscribe to all Lappe's philosophies, yet, this book had and continues to have a major influence on me. Rice and beans or grains and beans are regular items on our table, meatless days outnumber days when meat is on the table, and this is because I read Lappe's book long ago.

I had never heard of this event, myself.<br />In Ferry Woman, Gerald Grimmett tries to shed light on the role of John Lee, the man who bore the brunt of the blame for the historical massacre.<br />The author creates a fictional character (the Ferry woman) --one of Lee's wives. It is through her questioning eyes that the reader sees the events unfold. John Lee is hardly a pleasant character, the Mormons don't come off at all well. Even though Lee's role is toned to &quot;participated&quot; rather than &quot;instigated&quot;, Lee is not exonerated in the least. We also get a very gritty glimpse of the less-attractive side of life in Utah during the early days of the Morman settlements, and it seems pretty accurate. Life was, as is the familiar quotation, nasty, brutal and sometimes short.<br />I didn't know about this historical event (I guess my history of that part of the West begins and ends with the Mormons being run out of Nauvoo and the Donner Party.) So I didn't particularly have an opinion about this massacre. As a historical novel, it is well written and interesting. If you are a reader seeking a romantic-style historical novel, this isn't it. If you like realistic historical novels, you might really enjoy this book.	2002-01-27

Lewis wrote them not only as enjoyable children's fiction but as a way to introduce Christian thought.<br />C.S. Lewis was an Oxford scholar, an agnostic who became convinced that there WAS a god, and then became a Christian. Yet he infuses his beliefs gently into the Narnia books, and if you object to Christianity, you'd probably totally miss it in these books. If you object, in contrast, to Harry Potter, but want a good alternative, these books are just the ticket.<br />The stories are written with delightful visual appeal, great imagination, and with that English tongue-in-cheek humor that makes it fun for adults to read these out loud and enjoy the jokes on two levels. These are true fairy tales and as such, never fail to please children year after year. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, in particular, is high adventure, with dragons, dwarves, a mighty Mouse, and a ship adventure, and it's my special favorite.<br />The books emphasize the values of learning to struggle against temptation, of developing good and likeable character and the pain of growing up and having to leave the magical world of childhood behind. The books also hint at a need for spiritual growth<br />If you haven't read these, you are in for a treat. If you haven't read them to your kids, well, get a move on!	2002-01-19

You just aren't going to find a lot of genuine French furnishing and fabrics in the US. What if you want to use French elements in your decorating (as we did) and only have access to American furniture lines and the fabrics sold here?<br />This book provides a great solution. American houses are DIFFERENT than European, and what's sold in furniture and decorating supply shops is different, too. &quot;Provencal Interiors&quot; shows you how to get that effect with things you can get here. THAT'S great. If it isn't authentic, that's ok. If you don't have unlimited funds for a decorator to buy worldwide to create &quot;real&quot; Provencal, this book works really well. Maybe better.<br />The pictures give good examples of Provencal style rooms, and there are lists of suppliers that are helpful. The color schemes are perhaps the most useful part. Another useful thing are the fabrics and how to mix them. I myself have problems figuring that out; this helps.	2001-12-28

Then I got a recommendation from another Indian author to read &quot;Sister of My Heart.&quot; That was a good deed, (Thanks, Sharon) because I loved this novel, too.<br />The plot is very intricate and full of surprises. Sudha and Anju are two girls born in the same house on the same day, to different mothers, and from different fathers. Their fates are thereafter intertwined, and the two girls consider themselves sisters, if not actually twins. But their fates ultimately diverge--or do they?<br />Author Divakaruni can create surprise with a single word or short phrase. Her introduction of the word &quot;ruby&quot; in the first chapters stands out on the page as if it were a loud trumpet call. Her use of small, well-chosen words at JUST the right time can wake you up. Pay attention, something very interesting is about to happen. I just love that! And, just like Mistress of Spices, the author knows how to mix a fable or fairy-tale like story with an everyday drama. I love that, too.<br />This is one novel you should not miss if you love Indian fiction, if you love women's fiction (for any woman can enjoy this, I think) and if you loved Mistress of Spices.	2001-12-27

If you love painting landscape or natural subjects, you cannot go wrong reading this book. Roycraft's techniques look simple (a lot of splashing going on) but they are controlled and well thought out. If you love floral painting you should not miss his examples here of a peony and an iris. JUST Breathtaking.  I picked up so many ideas from this book.<br />Not only are Roycraft's paintings beautiful to see, he knows how to communicate his techniques incredibly well. I'm glad I found this watercolor artist's books.	2001-12-23

The techniques Roland Roycraft shares here are seemingly easy; splashing or flowing paint onto paper, masking and more. He also gives some very good hints for composition with clear details. Also value sketches (black and white, showing the density of darks and lights. This is a valuable technique for painters.)<br />I may not choose to imitate Roycraft's style, but I sure will be incorporating these techniques into my next paintings. If you want to improve your watercolor, I can't recommend this book and his other book on nature enough. They are just great.	2001-12-23

This is one of the most intelligent and interesting books on Hopper I've read. And I have a good-sized collection of books on this American artist because he's my favorite.<br />Not only are there rarer paintings and etchings in here not often included in coffee table books on Hopper, but author Kranzfelder shows his influence on photography, and shows the influence of other artists (notably Degas) on Hopper. Kranzfelder puts paintings and photos on one page, and the particular example of Hopper's work on the other so you can see the comparison side by side.<br />The text is also interesting and full of rare facts and a good analysis as well. If you want a great book about Hopper's work, this is one of the best I have seen. HIGHLY recommended.	2001-12-23

Rand was a mentor to the young Branden, who first contacted her while he was a teen in Ontario. She was impressed with his grasp of her philosophy Objectivism, and she, Branden, and Branden's future wife Barbara became friends, associates, and business partners.<br />When Rand began an affair with Branden, they both naively felt it would not affect their marriages (!) nor the functioning of the burgeoning Objectivist movement and the Nathanial Branden Institute. However, the idealism and fascination of a young man for his exciting mentor was ultimately not enough to base an emotionally satisfying relationship between a man and a woman 25 years his senior. Branden wished to withdraw; Rand felt her self worth threatened by a younger, more beautiful woman.<br /><br />The resulting firestorm of recrimination by Rand against the Brandens was first rumored about, then exposed over a number of years in several books, one by Barbara Branden (The Passion of Ayn Rand) and this book by Branden. How could someone who was so passionate being coldly objective about facts AND emotions go so wildly off-course? Some of the answers, according to Branden as he saw it and experienced it, are here in this book.<br /><br />What is NOT here is rather surprising from a noted psychologist, such as Branden is today. An in-depth analysis of the logic of Rand's fury is only sketchily guessed at, the logic of emotions as kind of a weather-report about the ego is not much dealt with. And Branden scarcely deals with his own duality in idealizing the woman he's with (either Rand or his wife) with the woman he truly wants (Patrecia.) Nor does he deal in much depth with Rand's monumental ability to deny reality when it pleased her or her form of intellectual bullying; shouting and cold, vindictive fury as a way to intimidate are surprising from someone who knew an ad-hominem attack from a logical argument and would not hesitate to call it out. I would have been interested in an examination of the psychology of this as Branden could have analysed it. But that isn't in this book either.

He once told me that artists break rules and then make new rules of their own. For example, look at Picasso. He broke rules about classical drawing and painting as he had done early in his career, and then created new rules for his style of Cubism.<br />I paint, and have a very definite set of rules about what I do and what I do not do. My painting teacher years ago had a lot of rules about watercolor, such as never using black or white paint. Later in her own career, she started breaking those rules with techniques not unlike those in this book (for example, she uses crumpled plastic wrap and laundry starch to texturize.) Her paintings really took off.<br />You may not like all the techniques presented here, but it's worth trying them out. One of them may turn out to get you out of a rut and onto new and great things. Even though &quot;Celebrate Your Creative Self&quot; sounds like books such as &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&quot;, &quot;Making Pearls&quot; or &quot;The Artist's Way&quot;, it is not about the inner artist. Those books have a very important place in freeing up the unconscious mind and the imagination. This book is about freeing up your technique and finding new methods of expression. Personally, I love it.	2001-12-18

Jan Yoors was the son of a Flemish stained glass artist. At a young age he ran away with a troupe of Gypsies (more properly, the Rom) who were camping in his Belgian home town. Yoor's parents amazingly accepted his new double life, as Yoors lived on and off with the Rom for many years. His life with his Rom family is covered in his first book &quot;The Gypsies.&quot; (which is another must-read.)<br />&quot;The Gypsies&quot; ends as WWII sweeps over Europe and catches the Rom in its poisoned grasp. Yoors then became an agent of La Resistance, and this book tells, in spare language and deep feeling, what happened to Yoors and his adopted family of Rom. Some of it was so horrific that Yoors can only allude to the events, and his emotions are so deep that we only learn a tiny bit of what must have happened to many of his beloved Rom family. The insight into the deep dedication of the Resistance leaders and fighters is unique.<br />Do read this book. It is so utterly wonderful that I pass copies of it out to many friends.	2001-12-15

My previous office had desks that adjusted up and down (you could stand if you wanted to.) The bank and post office were also a 5 minute walk down the hill so I got some fresh air during the day many times.  That was real luxury. Now I have a regular cubicle and the office is the only thing around for miles (hello, Dilbert.) At the end of the day I was surprise how sore and tired I was. This did not make sense, as I certainly was not doing any physical labor. The lack of movement turned out to be the source of the problem. The comfy chair just tempts me to sit and not move around. There's an exercise room, but who wants to change into shorts and a tee to get a breather? Not me.<br />So this book turned out to be rather helpful. In addition to stretches for fingers, wrists, hands and back, there are ones for the legs too. I find my hips get sore, and this helps a lot to do some simple stretching. The book is a nice, small format that you can hide in a drawer or leave on the desk without it taking up a lot of room.<br />There are some helpful hints, such as taking a break and walking outside if possible and  drinking lots of water. Now I make sure NOT to eat my lunch in my cubicle, and I make water breaks to refill my mug and take a stroll now and then. It helps a lot at the end of the day.	2001-12-15

I can make excellent pannetone, challah, white sandwich bread, spelt bread, wheat, brioche, coffee cake and oatmeal breads. But I have never once gotten a loaf of French bread from any recipe that even dimly resembled what I remembered from living in Europe, let alone the poor substitute in American grocery stores. Well, Mr. Ortiz' book solved that problem for me. This book will help you make as authentic a bread as possible, using ingredients available in the US.<br /><br />I started with the basic French bread recipe. This involves proofing the dry yeast with warm water, then pouring the lot into a pile of flour, either beating or mixing (I use a Kitchenaid, and he has specific instructions for hand, mixer or food processor.) I used ice water (weird, but keeps the dough at 75 degrees F, necessary for the correct build of the gluten.) I threw in the ascorbic acid into the yeast, and the salt into the dough as instructed. I went for more water in the dough as Ortiz recommends if you can handle it. I followed his instructions to the letter, as best I could.<br /><br />MANY hours later (rising took quite a while as the dough is so cool) I threw the boule onto the hot stone in the oven, chucked in a bit of water to make steam on the oven floor (you can do this on a gas oven.) Lo, after 40 minutes, I got a loaf of French bread with a creamy, somewhat gelatinous crumb and a crunchy, crisp crust. I also did use French SAF yeast and a French style flour from a Vermont based baking catalog company. Success! Well, well, well.<br /><br />This book is not as strong on German breads, which is a shame. Mr. Ortiz frankly admits he is not a fan of heavy German breads. Ortiz does include a few German breads, some popular Italian ones and the sweet French doughs as well. He also has artisan-bakery level recipes for greater amounts of bread.<br /><br />Next I will try the poolish (sponge) rising method and then on to the real challenge, sourdough.

This is a shame, because the author worked very hard to research his points, and he documents them all with many references and notes.<br />Fox culls data from famous psychology experiments, compares crime rates during the Depression to our times versus the relative amount of poverty, the increase in illegitimacy, the acceptance of illiteracy as a product of public schools. He comments on the anti-intellectual thuggery that inner city students experience, the strong approval of voucher systems by inner city parents who can get them, and many more factors that contribute or illustrate the decline.<br />Fox comes up with the not-earthshaking conclusion that boys need their dads, kids need good schools and that poverty alone does not generate criminals. Nothing you haven't heard on Dr. Laura or from Larry Elder, but it is supported here by a lot of data.<br />His arguments would have had more impact in this book with better editing. This book is valuable, however, as a resource because of its extensive notes. It would be a good reference book for anyone writing essays on the subject of American values.	2001-12-13

One moment, colors gleam from the paper like jewels. The next moment, a touch of the brush to a color yields nothing but muddy results. The mixing of the pigments is a true science mixed with art because the colors are actually chemicals that interact not only by reflecting light on their own, but also by interacting with other pigments, and reacting with the paper as well.<br />What to do when you want a particular color effect? Well, you can refer to this book. It has a color wheel organizing the pigments according to how they mix with each other to form secondary tints. Kosvanec gives examples of mixing greys, browns, intermediate tints that are guaranteed NOT to result in a blob of disaster on your painting. He gives quotes from famous artists who reaffirm the problem; one dab of just the wrong color and disaster results. He also includes some fabulous paintings, not only his portraits of native Americans, but those of other well-known artists.<br />I can't wait to try out Kosvanec's mixtures and suggestions on my next painting. I know I will be referring to this book over and over again.	2001-12-12

Chai is popular, and a great beverage for cold weather, although Indians drink it to cool off in summer as well.

While Little Men is not up to the literary achievement of Little Women, it is a wonderful tale for kids. It is JUST perfect for reading chapter by chapter to kids as part of an evening family night.

Plumfield is all that and more.<br />The jolly goings-on make you wish you could have gone to school and lived at Plumfield. The book is prevented from being saccharine by the all-too-familiar themes of neglected kids, growing pains and the sad and much too early death of a favorite character from Little Women.<br />There is lots of fun, and lots to discuss in this sequel to Alcott's marvelous Little Women.

Some fare well, others don't prosper. This is what makes Jo's Boy's somewhat somber in nature. Alcott notes the passing of Marmee, and others depart as well. A sadder tale, and a bittersweet end to the saga of the March family. A funny tidbit is the appearance of fans to bother Mother Bhaer (Jo). Alcott afflicts her alter-ego with the same annoyances that the fans created for her after Little Women. One uninvited admirer even cadges a postage stamp from her desk. A bit of real-life levity in an otherwise subdued book.<br /><br />Even if not up to Little Women's literary heights, Jo's Boys is a must-read if you want to know how it all turned out.

The hermetic atmosphere, with its peculiar customs, rich foods, rigid schedule and empty hours of &quot;the cure&quot; was at once ridiculous and addictive. The patients lived as if they were in a kind of glass dome where even time had no meaning. The absurd and the profound became huge preoccupations there.<br />Mann found the atmosphere so compelling that he knew if he didn't at once depart, he'd be tempted to stay for life. To work off his deep impressions of the place, Mann first wrote &quot;Tristan&quot;, a short story satirizing the patients and atmosphere at a sanitarium, and shallowly scratching the theme of sickness as a metaphor for refinement and beauty (like the Love-Death motif in Wagner's Tristan and Isolde.) However, this short story only whetted Mann's appetite to more deeply inspect the experience. He embarked, as usual, on a &quot;short novel&quot; and The Magic Mountain, emerged. And a mountain it is, too.  Mann said himself he just couldn't control the novel, it grew and grew of its own accord. And why not? To thoroughly (and I mean German-style thoroughly) investigate an experience of isolation and eternity, you'd need plenty of room to talk yourself out. This, Mann did.<br />What resulted was a dizzying achievement, a book of rich characters, philosophical struggles, intellectual foes pitted against intellectual opposites; the Dionysian pitted against the Apollonian; and of course the theme of society in the sweet snare of decadent dissolution before Armegeddon--WWI.<br />To give a snapshot of the plot: Hans Castor, a young man in his 20's, has finished engineering school and is about to start a career, none too enthusiastically, in shipbuilding. He takes a short vacation before starting his new job to visit a cousin in a tuberculosis sanitarium. The cousin, a young military man, is unhappily cooped up at the clinic. Castorp, however, becomes instantly smitten with the strange but alluring life in the sanitarium. He finds a reason to lengthen his stay; does he have a bad set of lungs as well? The novel takes off from there and Castorp finds a mentor in Herr Settembrini, an Italian humanist and begins to dive naively and recklessly into deep philosophical waters. Add a hard-to-get love interest and Castorp is lost to the world until a clarion call comes that he cannot ignore.<br />The author says in the forward that it is necessary to read the novel twice. At a minimum, I say. This is one book that can be mined endlessly for ideas, symbology, and even just to revisit irresistable characters like the good Joachim, Mynheer Pieperkorn, Clavdia Chauchat and Naphta in his silken lair above the tailor shop.ange but alluring life in the sanitarium.

The dissolution of the family firm, the artistic, Southern Creole background of Mann's mother and the struggle between the materialistic merchant side and the wild, artistic side are the backdrop for a deep regret, maybe even self-recrimination, for the family's ultimate decline. The family line ends, in Buddenbrooks with Hanno, son of successful and foppish Senator Thomas Buddenbrooks. When Thomas dies, the family firm is broken up and the family starts the deep decline already in process. Hanno's red-haired, violin-playing mother couldn't care less. (&#34;I live for Art&#34; would seem to have been written with her in mind.) Hanno's aunt Toni is left to mourn the family's end--though Toni's own earnest efforts to hold up family honor also ended in disaster. Some declines, apparently, are natural and cannot be prevented.<br /><br />The John E. Woods translation is very good (replacing the standard Lowe-Porter and updating some of the more colloquial German terms to current American English.) The Audible narration is excellent and really brings out a lot of the family drama. I've read this in German, in both translations in English and I love this version and if you find the book long at about 700 pages, the Audible whispersync is a very good way to get into it. I had no trouble, reading the book in entirety on a Sunday in college to the astonishment of my roommate, who thought I'd gone bonkers. But it was and still is, for me, a novel I can never get enough of.<br /><br />Interestingly, Mann puts a bit of himself in Toni as well as Hanno; he worked for a fire insurance company as did Toni's luckless son-in-law, he moved to Munich as Toni did in Buddenbrooks.  The other characters, Thomas's ne'er-do-well brother Christian, and especially the grandparents are beautifully drawn and developed.<br /><br />This is one of the best family chronicles written, and even if you don't love &#34;great literature&#34; you will enjoy this book. It's been filmed as well as a mini-series, but frankly, nothing comes up to reading this for yourself. I couldn't put this novel down once I started it. And it is a hefty book, though not the longest by Mann.<br /><br />You can still go see the house on Broad Street (Breitstrasse) (though not go in, it's privately owned) in Luebeck and walk the quaint alleyways where Mann grew up--and even the Waldhotel Riesebusch where the Buddenbrooks family enjoyed an outing is still in operation, with the same sloping lawns, in nearby Schwartau.y drawn and developed.

His themes and style are in miniature, because Thomas Mann may be an acquired taste in literature. He himself admitted that he had great difficulty knowing when to stop.

Well, it is far, far longer, and if you like Mann, you are glad of it. But to start, this book is probably the best one to get to know Mann.<br /><br />Tackling The Magic Mountain, with its long philosophical discourses, or other Mann novels is a lot easier if you begin with these short works. (Short is relative; Death in Venice was supposed to be a short story and ended up, predictably, a novella.) The themes in these works show up again in Mann's other writings; Tristan in particular, is a sketch for The Magic Mountain (thumbnail sketch, to be sure.) Tonio Kroger resembles Buddenbrooks in the autobiographical details and setting. The theme of sexual perversion and decadence heading to destruction (supposedly a metaphor for the society of pre-war Germany) appear in both Death in Venice and Blood of the Walsungs.<br /><br />If you are new to Thomas Mann, these works are a wonderful place to start. If you grow to love his writing, re-reading these is always a pleasure.	2001-11-27

Making Pearls is Vermont artist Jeanne Carbonetti's attempt to verbalize her creative exercises she uses and teaches for her free style of watercolor.<br />If you are a fan of Carbonetti's paintings, there are many photos of her work in this book to drool and marvel over. There is one useful exercise--making a &quot;creation cycle&quot; using the seven colors based on the India Chakras. Her theory is that we are always within the cycle of creation and need to recognize  where we are in the cycle to be in rhythm with the flow. If you can't take one of her workshops, using this book can lead you through the exercise.<br />Why &quot;Making Pearls&quot; as a title? This is a metaphor for taking irritations of daily life and making something beautiful from them, just as the oyster takes a grain of sand and creates a pearl.	2001-11-21

I got a chance to learn &quot;competitive Scrabble&quot; from a friend who is a nationally-ranked player. She insisted the road to success in Scrabble (not a burning ambition with me, but interesting nonetheless) is to learn a series of two and three letter words that look like cheating but are apparently real words to the dictionary people. In the older edition, these were separated out so you could spend your time memorizing them. This edition only has them listed alphabetically. So for ending arguments that EX and EL are indeed legal words in Scrabble, it's fine, but lacks that formerly valuable tool. Well, semi-valuable. If you get too good, your casual Scrabble-playing friends and family stop playing with you. This didn't happen to me, but I've heard that it happens.<br />So for home players who love Scrabble, this is a good reference. For competitive learning, get an older version.	2001-11-21

This handy book employs the EZ Percentage System, developed by Elizabeth Zimmerman. With a chest measurement and your gauge, you can make nearly any style sweater. But what is even better in The Sweater Workshop is the wonderfully wacky Knitting Sampler. This object, when finished, looks like a windsock or a fish and contains all the types of knitting operations you are likely to encounter when making a sweater, such as various ribbings, belt and cords, decreases, increases, color, cable and lace. The sampler is a very fun project that teaches you the basics you need to know to make nearly anything knitted. After you knit it, you can hang it up (be prepared for many &quot;What the heck is THAT!&quot; questions) and use the sampler as a visual reference for the techniques you may be using.<br />Thankfully, The Sweater Workshop is back in print, so if you want to learn to knit or improve your skills, you are in luck.	2001-11-12

Traver's Poppins books is that the character of Mary Poppins is a study in contrast. Like an old-fashioned nanny, on the surface she is severe, critical and exacting. After all, she is entrusted with the serious job of raising British children. Underneath the self-satisfied, and even annoyingly &quot;practically perfect&quot; exterior is a magical soul, who befriends an odd lot of misfits and manages to charm everyone, including some lonely and neglected middle-class British kids of the very early 20th Century. And who can explain jumping into chalk  pictures, laughter that sends you floating and many other odd occurrences that Mary takes as matter-of-fact.<br />The value of reading the Poppins series is that the books don't match the fun but more saccharine movie. The subtleties of a main character who is both lovable and cranky all at the same time make for fun family discussions and learning how to love people for their individual quirks, despite their more annoying characteristics. Every child should have the opportunity to enjoy this quirky, unique classic.	2001-11-12

He is far more Libertarian than the mainline Republican Rush Limbaugh, and says things that make his show more shock radio than Howard Stern. Elder contends that black Americans are more racist than white Americans, that guns save people's lives and that illegitimacy is the BIGGEST problem facing all of us. He is the personification of Politically Incorrect. And he is practically invisible; a black conservative. How many of those can you count on the fingers of one hand? (...)P>Elder points out (no surprise here) the liberal slant of the media and how they have forbidden frank talk about these issues, or have muted the conservative point of view to a dull whisper. Meanwhile, kids are raised without fathers and don't acquire the right social skills to become responsible adults, and the focus on a mostly imaginary racism deflects work on real issues like education, family structure and reducing the number of people who end up in jail for one reason or another (the war on drugs being another piece of idiocy.)<br />Elder is a true libertarian, meaning he favors personal responsibility, economic freedom and few social support programs. He provides figures and reasoning behind the failure of the social welfare system and he says the unsayable, over and over again.<br />It's been recently proposed to the UN that the US somehow make reparations for slavery that occurred 200 years ago. (...) Mr. Elder's book is a breath of fresh air into the argument. It's a great read.	2001-10-22

Yet Jane Eyre transcends the thrilling parts of the book to become one of English's greatest novels.<br />The novel is not without weakness; the entire St. John section is a bit overdramatic and somewhat contrived; yet it is essential to the novel not only for the symmetry but also to contrast a life that would only satisfy the flesh and sacrifice the soul (Mr. Rochester's proposal) versus a life sacrificing the flesh entirely for the sake of the soul (St. John.) Jane Eyre never falters from her conviction that, to be whole and true to oneself, both the spiritual and the carnal sides must be fulfilled. This was a daring proposal in Victorian England, and Jane Eyre was labeled \\"coarse\\" by one critic. Even more daring was that this philosophy was espoused by a woman writer, which is why Charlotte Bronte wrote the book under a gender-neutral pseudonym (Currer Bell.)<br />Why should you read this classic? Initially, Jane Eyre can be enjoyed for its well-told and enjoyable story--very romantic and exciting. What makes Jane Eyre an enduring classic is that you can read it and re-read it many times over for the perfection of its structure. I have a hard time choosing between Jane Eyre and Eliot's Middlemarch as \\"best English novel.\\"	2001-10-21

Nothing wrong with that, we all love those comforting favorites. However, it's easy to get bored with your slow cooker and then consign it to the back of that kitchen cupboard next to the fondue pot and the raclette set. Judith Finlayson's book could have you dragging the old Crok-King out of the cabinet again to try Pumpkin Soup with Shrimp and Lime, Bobotie (South African meat curry pie) and Thai-Style Coconut Flan. There are also recipes for seasoned mixed nuts and hot spinach cheese dip and even, dare I say it, fondue. Sounds like a party in the makings!<br />If you don't want to dine nightly on exotic fare, however, there are good versions of old standbys like Shepherd's Pie with Corn (ground beef, corn and mashed potato topping.) This is certainly one recipe that we love to come home to find steaming away in the slow cooker. There are also desserts, soups, appetizers and casseroles and roasts, even a vegetarian chili.  The desserts are puddings or fruit based cakes and cobblers.<br />Some of the recipes are designed for certain types of slow cookers; small size crock pots are specified for the appetizers, oval shaped for roasts. So if you only have one type of cooker, you may not be able to make some recipes come out without figuring out how to adjust them. On the other hand, a small crock pot is a handy item for entertaining and you might find one at a yard sale. This book could also help you decide which pot to buy, based on the type of recipe you are likely to make the most.<br />The photographs are clear and colorful, the recipes are varied enough to suit most tastes. If you would like to dust off your slow cooker and take it on a world tour, this book will serve as a great travel guide, but there are plenty of home-style recipes for when you just want something familiar.	2001-10-19

I watched Jay Winik give a talk about April 1865 on C-SPAN's Bookspan. WOW! We just HAD to get this book after listening to this incredibly articulate author. I didn't think anyone could really put a new (non-revisionist) set of ideas about the Civil War, but Winik really focuses on the men and the time of April 1865 and how the events of that month were such a pivotal time in our history.<br />The section on the Booth plot revealed facts I'd forgotton or didn't know (the attack also included Seward, Secretary of State and was as devastating in its time as the attack on the WTC.)<br /> The insights about Lee are fascinating. Lincoln held Lee in great esteem and Lee's gentleman-soldier qualities probably saved the United States from a protracted struggle and ultimate destruction. If Lee and his men had gone guerilla, as had been suggested to him, we might never have survived the Civil War and would have been easy pickings for European powers. Lee literally determined the course of history during that fateful month.<br />If you are a history fan, you will of course be interested in reading this fresh view on a well-trodden subject. If you aren't normally a history fan, but have recently gotten more interested in American history and patriotic subjects due to the recent attacks on the US, you will find valuable insight into our national character and background in this book. Highly recommended.	2001-10-19

Caldwell really brings Luke to life, from his beginnings as the young son of a greek freedman in the Roman Empire, to his ultimate search for Christ. Luke's spiritual search begins as a young child and continues throughout the Roman Empire, from a meeting with mysterious Chaldean priest, an encounter with Emperor Tiberius, up to his meeting with Mary, mother of Jesus. The background makes the Roman empire and the holy land in that time come to life. If you like historical novels, you can't go wrong with this one.	2001-10-04

Anna Leonowens remains a controversial character. The truth of her stories is questionable, her own biographical information may have been selectively edited or changed to reflect a more genteel background than Anna really had. Was she, in fact, an Anglo-Indian? Much scandal surrounds her still.<br />This book is the source, along with her other book The English Governess at the Siamese Court, for Margaret Landon's better known work Anna and the King of Siam. This book has the story of Tuptim, the concubine who was executed for running away, disguised as a priest. It is written in a typically Victorian elaborate style, so can be heavy going for some people. However, if you are curious about Anna herself, this is a must-read.	2001-09-19

The story of Maryanne and David Parkin spans the Gold Rush, Depression up until the 80's. It's well written, the characters are heroic. If it is a bit sentimental and old-fashioned, well, that's what gives this book collection its charm.

And he's versatile--check out Pillars of the Earth, which couldn't be more different than this book, Triple.<br />Triple centers on Nat Dickstein, who is working for the Israelis with the seemingly impossible task of stealing a sizable amount of uranium. Dickstein's exceedingly clever plan keeps you turning the pages, as do the counter-efforts of the Russians and Arab agents who want to derail his plan. The main characters are well-developed and multi-sided--and the &quot;bad guys&quot; are not just cookie-cutter heavies--they have their sympathetic side as well. Which, I think, is what kept me from putting the book down until I finished it. Great reading for a vacation, trip or just relaxation.	2001-09-15

The telling of the story is what makes this book so extraordinary. The world and characters created by Card are original and believable. The Battle School, a low and null-gravity space station where students who are potential military leaders are trained, is fascinating, not only for the war game played by the students, but for the psychological interaction of the students with each other and with the teachers.<br />Ender, the hero of the book, will appeal to anybody who suffered through bullies at school. He is also a sympathetic, intelligent person upon whom a lot is laden. We follow Ender through his training and development as a leader. The ending has a neat twist, and even more wonderful, the new parallel novels Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon are worthy companion books. (There are two earlier follow-up novels, good, but not on the same theme as Ender's Game. These are Children of the Mind and Speaker for the Dead.)<br />If you like military history, war games like Age of Kings, science fiction or stories of \\"coming of age\\", you will probably enjoy Ender's Game. It is on my top 10 Sci-Fi novels list.	2001-09-04

We will never know for sure. Worth reading	Anna Leonowens is a controversial figure even now. Her name may not even have really been Leonowen (but the more common Welsh Owens), her husband not dead from heatstroke in a tiger hunt, but from drink, and not a British army officer at all. Nevertheless, her account of her time in Siam as the royal governess is ever popular and fascinating reading.<br />Anna wrote several books, The Romance of the Harem being another. Both this and the Romance were novelized by Margaret Landon into the more familiar Anna and the King of Siam.<br />Part of the controversy stems from the fact that any criticism of Thai royalty is not tolerated in that country. The king is held in a religious esteem and is the heart and soul of the country. So Anna's casual remarks on the king's temper and habits are practically heresy to the Thai, hence, she and her writing are targets for criticism. And what's worse, her pupil Chulalongkorn or Rama V, is Thailand's MOST revered king--kind of a Thai saint. His portrait is found in nearly all Thai homes and businesses.<br />Having that as a background, it's still fun to read Anna's account of her time in Thailand. Though many people feel that Anna distorted or hid the truth about herself in many ways, the book gives a fascinating look into a magical land. Anna's writing is typically Victorian; the prose is a bit ornate and not as direct as the writing of Landon.	2001-09-04

Little Women is based on Alcott's life at home with her sisters, mother and father, but is in no way a biography. She transforms personal disappointment and loss into a story of close family love, personal growth, moral duty and fulfillment.<br />The writing is humorous, sentimental, a bit moralistic (which was the style at the time--the height of the religious revival in America.) The characters are true--because they were taken from Louisa's own sisters and parents. \\"Laurie\\" may be David Thoreau, a neighbor for whom Alcott may have had an unrequited love.<br />This is one of my favorite novels.

This is the greatest novel written in English	Yes, that is a strong statement, but I believe Middlemarch to be the best novel written in English. And English is a rich language, overflowing with worthy works from both sides of the Atlantic, India and beyond. The only novel as a close contender on my list is Jane Eyre, with its fearsome symmetry and romantic passion.<br /><br />George Eliot has been the bane of students everywhere who suffer reading Silas Marner in high school. But later on, you, like me, may develop a taste for the classics and this book will reward you richly.<br /><br />The story is about Dorothea, a young, idealist woman, born to a good family with a modest fortune of her own. She is a prime catch on the wife market--money, family name, good looks. Her parents are deceased and her friends and uncle seek to pair her up with a local baron as the ideal mate. But Dorothea, bookish, religious and dreamy, has other ideas. She chooses, instead, a superannuated cleric who finally decides to marry as he feels mortality and ill health upon him. Casaubon, the vicar of a nearby rural church is a good match except....he's old, ugly and what the heck is he doing marrying such a young beauty. But Dorothea, who's imagining a sort of superior father figure who could \\"teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it\\" wakes up to far less than a reality of marital bliss. And there's an added complication created by her unworthy husband that has dire consequences for the young Dorothea.<br /><br />The subsequent examination of marriage as a partnership in hell is written with stunning modernity. Eliot not only creates the disastrous marriage of Dorothea to Casaubon, but also pairs, as a comparison, Lydgate, a doctor and his frivolous, vain, uncaring wife. The relationship of marriage to society is never more well drawn, but the internal suffering of people trapped in loveless marriage is written with sympathy and cunning insight. Eliot herself had a live-in relationship with Henry Lewes, who could not divorce his wife. She undoubtedly wrote from personal experience. The insight into human nature, such as jealousy, disappointment, recrimination, loss of trust and a feeling of desperation are themes that anyone who has ever been in a relationship will recognize as truth. If you find classic literature hard going, watch the mini-series created based on the book.

And you know about the Stepford wives, But...<br />If you haven't read Levin's This Perfect Day, the third novel in this collection, you are in for a big treat. This is a science-fiction futuristic novel about a post-modern age society where disease, deformity, discrimination and any other social ill have been cured. A giant computer controls breeding, marriage, career and every other conceivable aspect of life. For those areas of human nature not controllable by computer, there's indoctrination and \\"treatments.\\" The treatment is a weekly hypospray of immunizations, birth control, hormones and LPK, a lithium-based tranquilizer that dulls the baser human urges and promotes peaceful behavior. And if anyone experiences even the slightest \\"friction\\", there is your personal advisor to monitor your behavior, and adjust your meds.<br />The hero of the book, Chip, is a square peg in a round hole.  He meets a few other such misfits and the novel is off to a wonderful adventure. The theme is individual freedom, overweening power and a dysutopian society where peace and prosperity come at a high price.<br />Worth reading. Don't miss it.	2001-08-02

Though not a chef or professional cook, she used her writing skills to delve into the mysteries of what makes good food great. And she did that with some of the funniest, sharpest, best writing since M.F.K. Fisher.<br />Alas, Laurie died in 1992, much too young, so you have to savor every scrap of writing she left us, in essays for Gourmet Magazine, and these, in her Home Cooking volumes. Colwin wrote  some novels as well, but really, her food writing is what I appreciate the most.as<br />Colwin's writing is opinionated and passionate: she goes into raptures over things most 7 year olds (and quite a few adults) would gag over; succotash, beets, goat's milk yogurt. Yet her sense of what makes food essentially wonderful will have even the most confirmed vegetable-a-phobe at least thinking about trying her succotash recipe or maybe even looking at a raw beetroot with calm impartiality. In case you are certain you will still shun beets and lima beans, at least read her description of how to roast a duck. It's splendid.	2001-07-25

However, After Many a Summer is a wonderful, not-very-long novel that displays Huxley's superb sarcastic wit.<br />In this novel, Huxley plays on man's fear of death. He creates a  somewhat W. R.  Hearst-like rich businessman who wants to use his money and power to cheat Death, and a scientist who has no compunctions against using any means to lengthen life, without questioning what quality that extended life really has. The ending is a real surprise.<br />This is one of Huxley's most enjoyable novels to read. It is also a timely one that can be read in the light of the new  genetic research pusing the boundaries of science. As in Brave New World, Huxley was frighteningly accurate in his prophesies.	2001-06-22

You are ready to achieve your dream to sail the Bahamas. Suddenly, your dream turns into your worst nightmare; the boat has a dangerous type of stowaway, and you are kidnapped by a ruthless if fascinating drug lord who wants something you don't have--and something you do.<br />This book has plenty of excitement, horror, heroics and a real villain. It reads like a made-for-tv movie. Is that bad? Well, not if you want a fast-reading, exciting tale for the summer or a plane ride to keep you turning the pages.<br />The author models the POW husband hero from her own life; is she the model for the heroine? I don't know, but this was a fun, quick reading book and certainly would please any reader of suspense or action thrillers. Pack it into your beach bag this summer and you won't be disappointed.	2001-06-04

Instead of following a pattern line by line (nothing wrong with that, I like to do that) you learn how to create sweaters to fit any body, with any yarn. Why would anyone want to do that? Well, you might have bought 15 balls of  yarn on sale and don't know what to make of it. Instead of waiting for a pattern to turn up for that amount of yarn, that weight, etc, you can create your own sweater in various styles to fit anyone, you, a family member or friend.<br /><br />The Percentage System used in this book is easy to follow: knit a sample of your yarn, carefully measure how many stitches per inch or centimeter, then multiply that gauge times your chest circumference MINUS 10 percent for the ribbing. Increase up to 100 percent and off you go. Soon you will have a yoke style sweater, Norwegian drop shoulder or saddle shoulder, or even raglan style. Such freedom. You can go to  yarn sales and as long as you have enough yarn, you can make anything from it.<br /><br />Right now I am knitting a cotton summer top using this method with some bargain yarn. While this book doesn't have gorgeous color photographs of stylish knits, it does teach you to create your own. After I bought this book, my knitting really took off. Yours might, too.	2001-05-21

One, out of print, has some of the best tasting recipes for international favorites. But the older WW books don't have the point system used by the current program. (The older system used servings of food groups, the new one uses points--low calorie foods like vegetables accumulate less points than high calorie fat-laden ones. You can eat anything, up to your point total. But if you blow it all on bags of M&amp;M's you will, of course be hungry!) So having recipes that use the point system is very handy to follow a Weight Watcher program. Plus, when you reach your goal, you have to try to stay within 2 lbs of the ideal weight. So, this book is handy to go back on the program if you need to.<br />This book has more good international favorites such as stuffed grapeleaves (Dolmades) and some American favorites like Tuna Noodle cassarole, which I love but which normally is too rich for me to enjoy.  You can make these recipes for the whole family because they taste good --just make plenty for the skinny big eaters to be satisfied. As always, Weight Watcher recipes are great-tasting. I actually prefer their versions of many things to the higher-calorie and fat original versions. You never are left banging on your plate yelling &quot;Hello, Mr. Taste??? Hello?&quot;	2001-05-16

They often were dancers or actresses and didn't marry--&quot;We never marry in our family&quot; states Gigi's mother. The Belle Epoque ended with World War One and saw the revitalizaton of Paris by Hausmann and others, creating the city's magnificent architecture that we still love today.<br />Gigi is a young girl of 16. She falls in love with a rich gentlemen of 33, Gaston. But contrary to custom, she wants something quite different that her family has planned for her. This reflects the idealized dream that Colette had of love with a much older man. She herself pursued this dream disastrously by marrying the highly unsuitable Willy, and also assigned her alter-ego Claudine the same but happier dream in her Claudine novels.<br />Read this for the wonderful evocation of Paris in the gay 90's, and realize that it has little to do with the musical--this is about a way of life that has passed, along with horse drawn carriages, laced hourglass corsets, and women's hats the size of cartwheels.	2001-05-01

They virtually POP against the purple flowers between them (yellow and purple are color wheel opposites.) That's just one trick to make your watercolor stand out that you will learn in this book.<br />If you love watercolor but hate that smear of pale blue, dull green and other types of landscape problems, look in here for solutions.

And she lived in &quot;interesting times&quot; in Europe and California. How to Cook a Wolf pitted her inate love of food and cuisine against some severe times when money might be short or food was rationed. Her strange sense of humor and practical outlook are interesting; for example, she gives a recipe for a sludge to keep body (if not soul) alive. The instructions begin with borrowing 50 cents to buy the ingredients; hamburger, wilted vegetables. The resulting mush can be used as a nutritious dog food, or a staple to survive on. She even claims it can be quite acceptable fried as scrapple, but then you'd have to have some cooking fat (and even that could be hard to come by.)<br />In these times of plenty, it's hard to relate to this book except to read Fisher's ideas and fantastic prose; the section on &quot;Sue&quot; (really California artist and etcher Nel Coover) who survived and entertained her guests with wild ice plants, seaweed and stolen eggs and potatoes is captivating.<br />If you have never read any M.F.K. Fisher, start with &quot;The Measure of My Powers&quot;, but if you have read her, and if you have developed a taste for her marvelous writing, this is one of her famous works that is unique and interesting.	2001-05-01

There are other novels (The Vagabond, Gigi, My Mother's House) but there are these short stories that are &quot;must-reads.&quot;<br />Colette was one of France's most distinguished writers. Though not a writer of massive books like Victor Hugo or Proust, or of psychological novels like Zola or Flaubert, she caught that French essence of individuality and quirkiness and  the golden age of La Belle Epoque before World War One changed France forever. Her books are pure joy as are these short stories. If you have NOT read Colette, you are in for a treat. (And don't neglect Claudine or Cheri. )	2001-05-01

Flatland is a classic dating back to 1880, but reads like a delightful fairy tale. It thoroughly explains the concepts of lines, planes and the limitations of our dimensions in space.<br />There is some amusing stuff here; the author is apparently a misogynist --women in Flatland are needle-thin, (well, that's not all bad) stupid, because of the size of their pointy heads (hey!) and violently dangerous due to their shape and lack of higher reasoning power.<br />Despite poking fun at females, this book is amusing and valuable since it can teach some great math prinicples. There is a \\"sequel\\" Sphereland published in the 20th century by a different author, that goes into dimensions higher than 3. It's fun, too. As an explanantion of the concept of dimension, plus for imagination, Flatland is a real classic and a favorite of mine.	2001-04-26

Fisher	This book of autobiographical essays is the best introduction to the writings of M.F.K. Fisher that I know of. I've read a lot of her books, and this remains a favorite. She gives us glimpses into the archaic and loving rituals of French cuisine, as practiced by the Burgundians, the strangeness of being a teenage girl in a cloister-like California boarding school in the 20's, and being the young, newly-married wife of a poetry scholar in Strasbourg.<br />The ironic thing about Fisher is that her husband was the literary scholar (Al Fisher wrote a monumental epic poem that vanished upon publication.) Her writing, however, is some of the best American prose; honest, perceptive, introspective and biting. Her work endures and provides more than just a viewpoint on cooking; it is a wonderful glimpse into pre-World War 2 Europe and America.	2001-04-25

I delayed reading it for years because I usually avoid cult classics and overhyped books. But the moment I started reading Dune, I was captivated.<br />This book creates an entire world and society (what I love best about sci-fi, when done really well.) And this book has an epic struggle of Good and Evil. The bad guys are really BAD. The good guys are complex, heroic and vulnerable at times. There are plots, sub-plots and counter-plots.<br />Some fascinating concepts are introducted in Dune; an order of women who control breeding of superior human beings and influence politics--the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats, human savants who replaced computers when computers were banned from the universe for their &quot;dehumanizing&quot; effect. And the Fremen, a desert people who are fiercer than the trained killer army of the Padishah Emperor.<br />This is the most exciting science fiction book I ever read, and is one of my favorite books of all times. If you haven't read it, you are in for a treat. Dune is complicated at times, but always worthwhile.	2001-04-25

And why a god? Because he is unique and practically, though not really, immortal.<br /><br />At the end of Children of Dune, (Book 3) Leto makes a terrible choice and covers himself with sandtrout, the spawn of the mighty Shai-hulud, the sandworm. This causes a transformation and we meet him, mostly Worm, all too human, in the fourth book. But until you read &quot;God Emperor&quot;, you won't really understand the struggle between Leto and his father Paul-Muad'dib, and why Leto made a choice much more courageous than his tragically failed father.<br /><br />The characters are very well drawn, as you'd expect from Herbert. In particular, Duncan Idaho, returned as the eternal clone or ghola, has a large role. Leto, bigger than life, still retains the human tragic-hero quality, similar to that of his father Paul-Muad'Dib. He has created an army of women, the Fish Speakers, to enforce his law throughout the galaxy. There is peace, but at what price? Despite the peace, Leto has powerful enemies, and he knows it. Some are enemies he has deliberately created. Why? Some characters are annoying: Siona, Leto's long-awaited progeny from his breeding program (much broader than the Bene Gesserit's plan to breed the &quot;Kwisatch Haderach&quot;) --Siona is a rebel and is a sulky, bratty and unreasonable young woman. Yet, she carries the hope of future humanity with her. Hwi Noree, also the product of a different breeding program (from the Ixians, the consumate machinists, of all people) is a wonderful foil to the softer side of the God Emperor, who usually is cryptically know-it-all and dangerously bored.<br /><br />The end of the story has all the qualities of a legend or great tragedy, though Leto's legacy is that men can survive an uncertain future. This is a fine book and better than the second and third of the Dune series, and in fact, it may be the second-best book in the first four: not as good as &quot;Dune&quot; but exceeding &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;--which are really setting the stage for the reign of Leto II in this book. After that, come the Heretics and Chapterhouse--the last two of the six, and those are far after &quot;The Scattering&quot; or the reboot of mankind's genetic code, as overseen by The God Emperor.<br /><br />By the way, this is very good in the audio format (Scott Vance, narrator) and the story is next to the initial Dune, my favorite of all the Dune novels and practically stands alone.he first four: not as good as &quot;Dune&quot; but exceeding &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;--which are really setting the stage for the reign of Leto II in this book.

This is a thrilling novel, pitting the Bene Gesserit against a new enemy, the Honored Matres. Obviously there must be some relationship between an order of women devoted to politics and breeding stock (Bene Gesserit=Well Bred) and a group of fearsome fighting women who unlike the Bene Gesserit, seem not to be addicted to the Spice. The Spice is that drug that creates the ability to see past and future and all the lives encapsulated in one's genes. It's now even more valuable as Rakis (once Arrakis) no longer produces the quantities of Spice as before.<br /><br />And what happened to the Fish Speakers, God Emperor Leto's army after the Diaspora, that time he had forseen when men would be scattered throughout the universe and once again re-invent humanity. Did they become the Honored Matres? Or are the Honored Matres something else?<br /><br />We get a new character here in the style of Paul Atreides, maybe even more successful than Paul; Miles Teg. A descendant of Paul, he is a born general and vital to the Bene Gesserit in their desperate fight to hold onto their worlds against the Honored Matres onslaught. And Duncan Idaho is reborn yet again, this time to serve the Bene Gesserit as he served the Atreides in the past.<br /><br />This book is almost as good as the original Dune, and its successor, Chapterhouse Dune is equally good. Together they make for an exciting set of science fiction novels.	2001-04-25

It has fantasy, horror, beauty and fun characters, but it also has some wise comments about life. (The scene where Dorothy unmasks the Wizard as a fraud and they chat about life back home and his life in Oz is one of the most touching conversations in children's literature. When the Wizard floats off and abandons Dorothy, we feel, as she must, the pain of disappointment.)<br />If you are reading to your children, this book is a top choice. Kids who are read to become better readers. And what can be more quality time that hearing the loving voice of a mom or dad or even elder sibling, reading an exciting tale?<br /><br />The centennial edition has 70 pages of biographical information about Baum, info on the entire Oz series (it's quite a number of books), a section about W. W. Denslow's beloved illustrations and much more. This makes the book not only a great family gift but also a good present for a child to treasure for his or her entire life. I still have my copy of Wizard of Oz, complete with a torn page (the pretty picture of Glynda on her throne), a souvenir of my baby sister (oh well) and I would NEVER part from it. This is a gorgeous edition and should be a top choice for your shelf of good children's literature.	2001-04-22

White's Once and Future King, Bernard Cornwell's series and of course seen films like Excalibur and First Knight.) Do I love Arthurian legends or what? So I couldn't put Bradley's The Mists of Avalon down for a moment. It was riveting.<br /><br />Marion Zimmer Bradley is a respected fantasy writer and highly skilled. Her version of Arthur's birth and reign are from the Druidic or Pagan viewpoint. So we get a glimpse of Arthur's birth and his relationship to his sister Morgaine through pagan rituals. The \\"fairy\\" side of the story (Morgan le Fay or Morgan the Fairy, The Lady of the Lake, Avalon) are developed beyond what anyone else has done in other versions of Arthur and Camelot.<br /><br />I enjoyed Mists of Avalon and thought the characters are well-drawn. The mysteries of Britain in post-Roman times before the first crusades are intriguing.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the Pagan religion as Bradley writes it is imbued with modern Wiccan beliefs, which archaeology and history tell us are rather different than how the ancients worshipped. Still, this is fiction, and so it's good to remember that how Arthur originated, and how the Pagans revered him is still shrouded in the mists of time.	2001-04-21

Bernard Cornwell, reknown for the Sharpe series, loves battles and military history. His research is always thorough. His books pull no punches describing battles and acts of violence (how Nimue gets her wisdom is a graphic scene, for example.)<br /><br />If you loved Braveheart, this novel reads a bit like it in style. No flowery prose here, instead, we have a gritty description of life as it must have been in Arthur's time, nasty, brutish and short as Hobbes accurately described times when man is enemy to man.	2001-04-21

It's the story of a little girl who endures some setbacks but reaches a happy ending not only for herself, but for those around her whom she helps even when she's pretty downtrodden.<br />The writing is charming and Sara comes through as a person who is determined to maintain her values, through good times and bad. She has a definite personality and that is a good role model for any child. She stays true to her beliefs in being kind, mannerly, charitable and above all, herself.<br />The magic in this book is unsurpassed in children's literature. When Sara comes home, wet and cold and neglected, to find that a magician has transformed her world, you can't help but be enchanted. I will admit to reading it again now and then as an adult. The charm is still there.<br />Just a fun factoid; A Little Princess was originally a shorter story titled Sara Crewe, in a volume of children's novelettes by Burnett.	2001-04-18

We never learn the name of the heroine as she marries Max, moves into the rigid but elegant life at Manderley and tangles with Mrs. Danvers, Manderley's fearsome housekeeper. What unfolds is not only a mystery but a story of obsessions and evil. The end is a shock.<br />Du Maurier created an unforgettable atmosphere of decaying beauty, frightening spirits and horror mixed with love and death. If you haven't read this, I am envious.

We did it in shades of peach and beige, with a pretty wallpaper border in matching shades from the local building supply store. It didn't cost much and the result is STUNNING.  I'm not a fan of a lot of stenciling, faux this and that, but I have to say, this book has techniques that really look amazing.<br />We practiced on scraps of wood or wall board to gain confidence before plunging in. I can't wait to try some of the other techniques.<br />If you run out of rooms and furniture to renovate, you can always restore yard-sale finds and donate them to church or school craft fairs.  WAY too much fun. This book is a real treasure.	2001-04-13

About time someone wrote about human nature and the fact that people are not machines. The myth of &quot;total efficiency&quot; still persists in the workplace.<br />This book is in sharp contrast to practices that have plagued the workers for decades; women who sewed in sweatshop factories in the early 1900's were carefully monitored on how long they took to make bathroom breaks.  Even now software is available that can count every keystroke a worker makes (to check on their efficiency.) The dream that careful monitoring and structuring of the workplace to get the maximum &quot;juice&quot; out of workers is disproved in this book.<br />This isn't even totally new information; a very old study found that brightening the lights in a factory improved performance. Then another study found that DIMMING the lights also improved performance. In other words, people are not machines. They need downtime, change, meaningful work and mental breaks or they burn out.

Set in India, England, and Guyana, the story centers around an orphan and his adopted father, the mystically endowed daughter of a cook, an Indian family in Guyana and an English family in India at the end of the British reign.<br />The characters all have a bit of India mythology associated with them. Each has something magical or mysterious. Each takes on a different guise or identity from time to time, like the multiple personalities of the Hindu gods and goddesses. On top of all this lies a very well-told tale of love lost and found, with some nice surprises right up to the end.<br />My only criticism of the book is that from time to time in the book, Hindi words are used that most people may not be readily familiar with. While some of the words are common ones, others could have been replaced by the English equivalent with no loss to the atmosphere they provide. There is a glossary in the back of the book, however, so this is a minor issue.<br />I give it five stars because I am going to re-read it right away!	2001-04-11

Midlife can be liberating	Stephanie Marston is one of the most sought-after experts on women and midlife. She interviewed a large number of women for this book and combined it with her own experience for a book that sheds a lot of light on what it means to be a woman during that mystical and misunderstood phase of life, menopause.<br />In one part of the book, the author describes how she goes through her closet, tossing out designer high heels that pinch, clothes that are too tight in the waist, that itch, and replaces them with comfortable clothes that reflected her new feelings about herself. This is a wonderful metaphor for what many of the women in &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot; go through in their relationships. Marriages are suddenly confining, &quot;going-along-to-get-along&quot; no longer works. Passive acceptance of all kinds of things, from being the chief organizer of holiday dinners to shutting an eye to infidelity is no longer tolerable. Women who are at the age of menopause may feel a simultaneous burst of anger and liberations. It's not all bad. In fact, it can be pretty darn good!<br />This book talks about the psychology of maturity for women. It expands on what Christine Northrup calls &quot;the lifting of the veil of hormones&quot; and shows what positive changes lie ahead for women who may have suppressed their true identity for most of their lives. Women who once relied on beauty to manipulate the world look in the mirror and realize that despite the best that exercise, diet, cosmetics and surgery can give them, they are no longer youthful goddesses. Their entire way of dealing with and being dealt with changes<br />Marston describes how women are socialized from birth to bury part of their true selves, to be &quot;good girls,&quot; to willingly lose games to boys, to place their light under a bushel. This is why girls who do well in elementary school suddenly drop behind the boys as they go to middle school and reach menarche. A quote in the book from Emily Hancock remarks that there is a &quot;buried core of women's identity...a root identity that gets cut off in the process of growing up female.&quot; At the time of menopause, women begin to regain this identity, fueled by the lifting of the veil of hormones and the completion of the phase of life where motherhood and physical attractions are the main thing women are valued for.<br />There are 40 million women, baby boomers, facing menopause. Up until now, medicine has viewed menopause, like childbirth, as a medical condition to be &quot;treated.&quot; Now women are redefining what it means to be a complete, mature woman and they are a powerful presence.  If you are a woman of any age old or young, this book will be of incredible value to provide insights into what it means to be a woman and to be yourself.marks that there is a &quot;buried core of women's identity...a root identity that gets cut off in the process of growing up female.&quot; At the time of menopause, women begin to regain this identity, fueled by the lifting of the veil of hormones and the completion of the phase of life where motherhood and physical attractions are the main thing women are valued for.<br />There are 40 million women, baby boomers, facing menopause.

Wrong, Barbara Walker takes you through a method to start from the neck down. This isn't just to be contrary, there are definite benefits to knitting top down.<br />One thing you can do is check the length while trying it on. Yes, you can do this. Put the unfinished stitches on a strand of yarn and slip the sweater over your head (or the head of the recipient.) You will quickly see how much more you need to knit, or whether you should add &quot;short rows&quot; (extra half rows that add a bit of ease) to cover a tummy or get rid of the dreaded riding up in the back. The book has methods for saddle shoulder sweaters (easy the top down way), raglan, drop sleeves, etc.<br />The book also has great methods for doing leggings, tights, skirts and other items you might want to knit but don't know how to. With a simple gauge-and-circumference technique you can make nearly any garment for anyone.<br />This is a revised edition. The original had some very dated 70's patterns and the new edition has been modernized.	2001-04-10

So is important advice on how to store fish you buy. You won't be able to reproduce everything at Legal's, and if your local fishmonger has less than top quality fish, the flavor will also suffer.

Nancy Nix-Rice introduces the concept of &quot;clothes capsules&quot; in her book &quot;Looking Good.&quot; These are sets of your existing clothes (or helped out with items you might want to purchase.) These are tops that go with slacks, skirts, the accessories. You put them together in your closet and never have to say &quot;I don't have anything to wear.&quot; You also can learn to purchase items (even those tempting bargains) that fit with the capsules.<br />But that isn't all that is in here. There is scarf-tying help, accessory advice, color advice for your complexion, make-up advice including a face chart, sewing information, mending, clothes and fabric care, renovation and remodeling out-of-style clothes, and how to pick the proper clothes to flatter any figure. And I mean ANY. She has photos that are astonishing, showing how even someone with a very full figure can instantly improve the very same outfit by using a buckle, the right color stockings and the right hem length.<br />Just about anything you'd need to know about keeping your wardrobe up to date and flattering to you is in this book.	2001-04-09

The tragic character of the Communist official Andrei is incredibly well-done.<br />This book is a bit raw in places, showing the deep feelings that Rand must have experienced as she re-lives the world she left behind along with a family she never saw again.

It was a huge hit amongst my classmates, and we wore through several copies of Cheaper By the Dozen.<br />The Gilbreth family of 12 kids, parented by efficiency experts Lillian and Frank, were a bit eccentric and very funny. I still can remember the line one of the kids rapped out to a guest at dinner &quot;Please, we are NOT in the mood for an organ recital.&quot;  This was the standard reprimand for belching in the family and never intended for public airing.<br />The Gilbreths were actually serious innovators of efficiency for the new factory assembly lines, figuring out the number of movements needed to complete a task and establishing a unit of work movement called the Therblig. They were also warm, funny, loving parents and their story is a good one to read out loud to kids, who invariably love this book.	2001-04-09

And I learned to cook as a child from my mom, so I've been cooking for decades. But what if you didn't learn to cook and now you have to? This is a great book for learning important basic techniques.<br />I didn't like all of the recipes I saw, but the IDEAS are right. And keeping broth and frozen spinach on hand is a good thing--I always do that myself. Wonton skins are useful as well, but I don't agree with a no-bake lasagna. The blueprint for creating stir-fry is also helpful. If you already know how to cook, you won't need this book.

This is my favorite sewing book, and although I still don't sew clothing all that well, I reach for this book anytime I need to sew something.<br />The home furnishing section turns out to be very useful.

If you like to create your own jewelry or decorative items, Kato's book is chock-full of useful techniques. I made malachite for a book cover that was just fantastic. And it will get you interested in really wonderful techniques like Moku-gane, where you layer clay with metallic leaf and shave it for a wood-grain moire effect that is really stunning. There is instruction for faux gemstone materials. The bone and coral are especially realistic.

While Nathan Price is a hard-driven missionary, his wife and children are all marching to different drummers. This is set against the backdrop of a totally hostile environment; there's revolution brewing in the Congo and the very land itself is toxic to the inexperienced Americans.

The two middle daughters are twins, one being a girl with disabilities who later turns out to be quite a interesting person, despite or even because of the disabilities. The four voices are each distinct, but they are slightly unbelievable.<br />I couldn't put the book down. The disasters are epic, the problems strange and monumental.

Harper Lee only wrote one novel, To Kill A Mockingbird. I think she only wrote one book because it was perfect.<br />This is a story set the South of the Depression era. It's a story about injustice and prejudice and one man's attempt to stand up and do what is right. It is also about growing up and losing childhood innocence, about terror and about mis-judging all kinds of people.<br />The theme of intolerance and fear plays itself out on many stages in this book, from the frightening character Boo Radley who is a strange recluse and a fairy-tale monster to the town's children, the black man Tom Robinson unjustly accused of raping a white woman, to the white-trash Ewells and Mayella Ewell herself, the supposed victim.<br />All the horrors you usually hear about on daytime television are in this book, however their portrayal and the revelations are not shock TV but lessons about human weakness and human nobility.<br />It's a great novel, written in such style that you can smell the dust, feel the humid heat and experience life in a small Southern town in the '30's. Just as an interesting bit of trivia, the character Dill, childhood friend of Scout and Jem, was in real life Truman Capote, a childhood friend of Harper Lee.	2001-04-04

Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good book on a sensitive issue	Discussing money and wealth can be as sensitive an issue for some people as discussing their sex life. The author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad can appeal to many people for whom the subject of investing and earning is very hard to think about.<br />The author describes the difference in attitude and outcome for his &quot;poor&quot; real dad, a professor, and his rich dad, a neighbor who had a gift for investing in real estate and making good business decisions. Many people feel nervous about investing, if not downright scared. Kiyosaki contrasts the two dads in a way that can make even the investing-shy take notice. Also, not everyone grows up in a family where investing is a skill that is talked about or practiced.<br />But now, since 401K's, IRA's and self-directed pensions are the norm, everyone has to become self-reliant to some degree to plan for their future. The days of company pensions and living on social security checks is long gone.<br />I had a friend who was very uneasy about any investing. He read this book and it was a complete eye-opener for him. He felt a real kinship with the author and was able to understand the principles being discussed. This is a &quot;people&quot; oriented investment book. If you know someone who is shy about money issues, I recommend it as a good way to discuss how to plan for the future. It's especially good in times of downturns in economy when a good attitude ad knowledge of fundamentals can help you through uncertain times.	2001-04-04

Lewis Henry Morgan was actually an attorney in Rochester, NY and practicing law around the time of the Civil War. But he is famous for his contribution to the science of anthropology, known especially for establishing the study of kinship systems and for his theory of social evolution.<br />His work with the Iroquois Nation was extensive; he was even adopted by a clan of the Senecas for his achievements in bridging the terrible gap between the native American nations and the US.<br />Much about native America would have been misunderstood or lost had he not written his journals, and his development of kinship systems set the foundation for anthropological work ever since.<br />The artwork in this book is stunning. The portraits are alone reason for having this book.	2001-04-03

The novel is set around the time of the Opium Wars (ca 1840) with creative license taken with some of the historical timeline.<br /><br />This is also a love story--a romance set in an exotic historical setting. The impossible love of Peony for her young master, David, and the love triangle between David, Leah, the daughter of the rabbi, and Kueilan, the pretty but frivolous daughter of Ezra's business partner makes for plenty of romantic conflict. The novel cleverly tells the tale of a prominent Jewish family struggling to retain their identity, yet having for several generations married Chinese wives and becoming slowly absorbed into Chinese culture.<br /><br />The language Pearl Buck uses is clever; if you've read &#34;The Good Earth: she keeps the language simple  to catch the flavor of the simple Chinese peasant farmers. In Peony, she captures the formal interactions between masters and servants, between men and women both Chinese and of foreign descent. She succeeds brilliantly in making the speech patterns of each character suit their role. The characters are well-drawn and appealing; the wise and beautiful Peony, who was bought as a child abandoned and sold by parents during many of the floods and famines, David, the handsome young son of the family, Ezra, his earthy and lovable father and his dominating mother Naomi, who struggles to carry on the traditions in a foreign land. The minor characters are equally good--Wang Ma, the old servant woman, Aaron, the criminal and lost son of the Rabbi, and Kung Chen, Ezra's Chinese business partner.<br /><br />The story is wide-ranging, from the intimate story of life inside the walls of a Chinese-Jewish household with its extended family and servants, all the way to the Manchu court of the Western Empress Tzu Hsi. The story of the Jews in China is well-told and interesting and for the most part (excepting the timeline) based on factual information. There is epilogue to the book discussing the historical background (not available at the time of publication, when I first read this book) and it provides an interesting backdrop to a romantic historical novel hinese Jews arrived, possibly via the Silk Road during the Renaissance in Europe, but possibly even as early as the 600's. Pearl Buck shows an amazing knowledge of their story; a book had been published on the subject of Chinese Jews a few years before she started this novel and it provided excellent background for their astonishing story.<br /><br />And of course Pearl Buck is first and foremost a wonderful story teller. I think this is one of her three best books (The Good Earth, Imperial Woman being the other two.)  If you like Amy Tan, you are sure to enjoy this book toov.ed on factual information.

Despite the fact it seems a bit old-fashioned, the things that are true in How to Win Friends and Influence People are still true and still work.<br />The principles that work best for me are:<br />1. Never Criticize, Condemn or Complain.<br />2. Get the other person to say &quot;Yes&quot; immediately<br />3. Talk in terms of other person's interests<br />For getting to agreements in tough situations, this stuff still works. Life at work is full of disagreements and misunderstandings.

It pretty much described the same things that Dr. Greene does in his book.<br /> The combination of inflexible (and often ritualistic behavior especially when eating, dressing or going to bed) are frequently combined with exploding tantrums. Dr. Greene does a tremendous service to parents who have such a child, so that they can get a handle on the problem. Punishment and labelling young children as &quot;bad&quot; does no good. Understanding and proper treatment will save a lifetime of woe. Thanks, Dr. Greene.	2001-03-30

I have The Top 100 Pasta Sauces and I think that it is a very useful book. We pull it off the shelf to make last-minute dinners from any vegetables lurking in the crisper and get a nutritious, elegant dinner in no time.<br />Now Diane Seed has written the Top 100 Italian Rice Dishes and I could NOT wait to get this. One of us at home had to stop eating wheat, which mean pasta, other than from special grains, was out. So we eat rice, which anyway I personally prefer.<br />Risottos are really wonderful but there is more than just risotto in this book. There are soups, cassaroles, molded rice rings and more. Some dishes are simple, some are quite complicated and worthy of a dinner party.<br />My favorites so far are the Rice and Eggplant Palermo Style, Lemon Risotto, Spinach Risotto and Pumpkin Risotto. These are healthy, vitamin filled and interesting dishes that are easy to digest. There are also lovely meat dishes, including a Sicilian Christmas rice platter that includes meatballs, sausage and chicken.<br />Many of the recipes specify Arborio rice. This is a flat grained, medium rice that cooks up rather like pasta (a bit al dente.) It can be expensive and hard to find everywhere in the US, so you might have to substitute medium grain Spanish rice, which is not the same. I sometimes substitute Thai rice in defiance of the recipe and it works, although the result is a bit different. The authentic Italian Arborio comes out moist and even a bit soupy at times. So if you can get Arborio rice, fine, if not, wing it and it still tastes wonderful.	2001-03-30

She wrote pretty well, too! She was quite a personality and when she passed away in 1999, she merited a long obit in the New York Times. Subsequently, a knitting craze hit the world. Is it a coincidence, or did she impart her spirit to all of us when she left after a long and fruitful life.<br />This book is utterly delightful. It is my favorite knitting book and if I could only have one, this would be my choice. I have knitted my way through most of the patterns and they are varied, interesting and good for designing your own things.<br />Included in the book is the percentage system, same as in Knitting without Tears, her classic for beginning knitters. This is applied to a beautiful Shetland sweater with a yoke fair-isle design. This classic design looks wonderful on children and adults. You can make it in any size.<br />There is also the wildly clever Moccasin sock, that can be re-soled. The construction is unlike any other kind of sock and shows the brilliant engineering mind of EZ.<br />There is a shawl (PI r squared) which is a varation of the PI shawl found in the Knitting Almanac. This has a straight front, like a stole, and rounds off in the back.<br />The Moebius scarf is also in this book (a ring with a twist that goes around your neck and drapes attractively.) These are just some of the knitting patterns; there is a lot more. Elizabeth knew how to pack a book with plenty of information and this is no exception.<br />There's not only knitting here, there are lovely color photographs of Elizabeth's watercolors (she was trained in Munich at a famous art school.)

There are 4 original great books by EZ (Knitting without Tears, Knitting Almanac, Knitting Workshop and Knitting Around.) Lately, two more, The Opinionated Knitter and Knit One, Knit all have been added to the group. They feature a method of knitting without strictly written line-by-line patterns, and some novel construction methods.  This book, Knitting Workshop has the famous \\"surprise\\" sweater which looks like a rumpled bathmat and magically transforms, with a few deft flips and a bit of legerdemain, into the cutest baby sweater you ever saw. It can be modified to make an adult jacket, too.<br /><br />The book has been updated. There are new color photographs of the knitted patterns, new drawings, some new techniques, and extended sizes. The book also has plenty more useful and adaptable patterns--sweaters, hats, you name it. And since the patterns are adaptable to many kinds of wool, this is one knitting book that won't seem dated five or ten years from now. Some of the patterns are a bit quirky, like the heart-shaped hat. Some of the patterns are absolute go-to classics; another kid's pattern, the Tomtem coat is a hooded jacket that works so well for cool, damp days. There are quite a few shawls, but the Pi Shawl is a long-standing favorite--a round lace shawl that has a simple design of eyelets that make decorative look. The shawl can be done in rings of color or plain. Its simplicity of design lends itself to lace patterns, and many people have used it as the springboard for some very elaborate, lacy round shawls.<br /><br />There are also patterns for seamless patterns for sweaters with raglan or saddle shoulder. These can be made up in various sizes based on chest measurement for a custom fit.<br /><br /> The book was written to go with a video series. Some of the videos are still available from the publisher. The book, however, stands alone as a great knitting classic, and one that I reach for all the time.	2001-03-29

Keep this in your knitting bag	This is a small book that packs a lot of knitting punch. The Knitting Almanac is very useful for many types of projects. The book is arranged by season as Elizabeth knits her way through the year, making warm things for her entire family. There's some fun commentary, too.<br />Let me list some of the most useful patterns in this book:<br />Best baby sweater. This is a lacy cardigan with a round yoke, easy to make, and so pretty. I made so many of these I can't even count. The lace stretches a bit, so the growing infant gets a lot of wear out of the cardigan. And it's easier to dress Baby with something that doesn't pull over the head.<br />Leggings. If you want to make warm tights for babies, kids or even adults. It's HARD to find such a pattern.<br />&quot;PI&quot; shawl: this is a round shawl that folds into a semi-circle. Very elegant, you can add your own lace stitches to make it unique.<br />Shirt Collar sweater--good for summer, short sleeved with an open collar. Can be made in any size.<br />Mittens, socks, an Aran sweater, there's more. This book, packed as it is, still fits into even a small knitting bag or purse and is not expensive. This has to be the biggest bang for the knitting buck I know of. I'm on my second copy. I wore out the first one.	2001-03-29

However, this book was written before he got &quot;religion&quot; and is not for the fat-conscious.<br />Having said that, can there be anything in this book for people who do not wish to eat a lot of fat? The answer is &quot;yes&quot; and here is why: Chef Prudhomme gives a very useful set of techniques to maximize the flavors that make the complex spice bouquet of real Louisiana cuisine.<br />As an example, I have used the Jambalaya recipe in this book many times. It is different from most recipes for this rice-sausage-and-meat cassarole. Prudhomme's version is served with a wonderful spicy tomato sauce surrounding a molded cupful of the rice mix. This is a very elegant presentation, adds moisture and flavor to the dish...and allows you to substitute ingredients and still get the sense of the genuine thing. (I use turkey Kielbasa, cut way down on the oil and use lean chicken breast for the meat.) The sauce is what makes this work so well.<br />Chef Prudhomme recommends &quot;building&quot; flavors by adding spices and herbs in stages. Some at the beginning, sauted at first, some later on near the end, to freshen the taste. He also makes a very important instruction about the miripoix mix--the onion, green bell pepper and celery base of many Cajun and Creole dishes. He says it's best to cut the vegetables, especially the bell pepper, very fine as that preserves the taste. It's true. Larger pieces of pepper taste bitter and flabby.<br />This kind of advice makes Prudhomme's book extremely useful. If you follow the flavor building advice, you can cut out a lot of the fat and substitute lean meats and still get good results from this book. Of course, you can't make a roux (flour and oil, cooked dark for a thickener) with no fat. So that can limit you.  Or you make the recipes as written  every once in a while for party occasions when the brakes are off. Either way, the techniques in this book are very useful.this book are very useful.	2001-03-29

While this may not last long, it becomes vital to find ways to motivate employees, especially if a firm is not hiring or cannot spend much on extras and must keep current employees productive and happy.<br />The good thing about &quot;1001 Ways to Reward Employees&quot; is that not all the ways require big expenditures. The book gives ways to match rewards to your budget. More importantly, it also lists how to match the reward to the type of employee. The book lists best practices from organizations as diverse as BankBoston, Disney and the Federal Government.<br />Praise and thank-you's are some of the rewards discussed. These come from findings of surveys where many employees say they would really just like recognition and gratitude for special efforts.<br />There is a useful section giving sources for specialty rewards, firms that can arrange reward activities, travel, and companies and associations that specialize in rewards and incentives.<br />All in all, a useful book and one that could help any manager get more productivity and boost morale while holding down costs.	2001-03-29

(If you are lucky enough to live in the Northeastern US where Lebanese restaurants are to be found, you can experience this yourself.)<br />The Lebanese are particularly skilled with vegetarian foods like beans and salads. You can make hummus (chickpea and sesame puree dip) yourself instead of paying high prices for average preparations in the grocery store. Also, the tabbouleh recipe here is wonderful. This is a salad of soaked bulgur wheat (a bit like a pasta or rice, made of cooked, dehydrated cracked wheat berries) and tomatoes, parsley and lemon. It's refreshing and great for summer and to take to covered dish parties.<br />You don't need meat to make good Lebanese food, as this book amply demonstrates. This is now one of our kitchen standards, and it really adds color and life to the vegetarian table.	2001-03-28

You can learn to knit socks from the toe up. Normally, socks in Western European countries and the Americas are knitting from the cuff down. But you can knit a sock starting at the toe, increasing until the foot width is sufficient, and go on from there. The heel can be inset a number of ways, but is not turned as in cuff-down socks. The instructions Anna Zilboorg provides are about the best I have seen for doing toe-up designs. It isn't easy at first to negotiate the 4 needles and the few stitches on them, but it is worth learning because it is a fun and useful technique.<br />Eastern European socks are mostly knitted toe up. So this is something new for many knitters. Turkish designs are also something new; they have the property of balancing the &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; parts of the design, meaning that the design and background colors are about equal in importance. The repetitive nature of the Turkish patterns makes it rather easy to create some pretty complex looking designs. They lend themselves to gorgeous colors, as in this book. Designer Anna Zilboorg is particularly well-known for her color work and she dyes her own wools to get some of the striking color combinations.<br />Even if you are not a sock knitter, the Turkish patterns are very useful for adding to vests, sweaters and afghans. They are very pretty and fun to knit. So if you decide you don't want to make socks, you can use the color and patterns to spice up some other types of garments.<br />This book is reprinted from &quot;Fancy Feet&quot; which went out of print and looks very spiffy in its new cover design.	2001-03-28

Naked means here that ingredients are kept to a simple level while taking them to heights of culinary achievement.<br />I like to give this book as a fun wedding shower present because the recipes are straightforward--and the title of course is amusing. Best recipe for me is the risotto, which is a tricky dish to make and comes out wonderfully well here. (And if you have a  non-wheat eater in the house, a good risotto recipe is essential as that replaces versatile but forbidden pasta.)<br />It's also a good book to send off with anyone starting out for themselves (after graduating school, moving to a new apartment) because they can buy a list of ingredients and use the recipes to make excellent food that even serves for entertaining. Just for the mushroom risotto (mentioned above) and the basic but excellent roast chicken, someone could become a very fine cook in short order.	2001-03-28

None of them really helped us. Turns out we collect clutter for entirely different reasons. Books that try to deal with &quot;personality&quot; just didn't seem to work for us. Books that more or less said &quot;get over it&quot; also didn't work. But we have to pare down because we are going to move twice in the next two years (ugh.)<br />The secret to &quot;Clear Your Clutter With Feng Shui&quot; was to find why we both were keeping some things. (There is a section with helpful questions about why you keep stuff, such as inheriting it, sentimental feelings, habits, family habits, and even grief.) In our case, a friend from childhood and a parent had both died within two years and this caused a desire to cling to a lot of old things.<br />Excess clutter is thought to sap energy. It certainly saps concentration and gathers asthma-inducing dust. Now our apartment looks better, breathes better and yes, smells fresher and thanks to this book. First one I've ever read that could help two different people living together because it deals with the individual motivations behind the junk they keep.	2001-03-27

So I was very glad to get this book and find that the Shrimp Creole recipe is terrific for parties. So is the Hot Jalapeno Crab Dip. There are also a lot of rice recipes in the book--and I like rice dishes for parties, which is why I was stuck on Jambalaya for so long. Because Emeril encourages you to &quot;kick it up a notch&quot; or go &quot;BAM&quot; you can always adapt these recipes to your own tastes. This isn't a sacred text, to be read aloud in hushed tones as you measure the ingredients with a scale and tweezers.<br />This is &quot;BIG&quot; food. We are not talking low fat, nouvelle cuisine -type fare served on huge empty white plates with Monet impressionist paintings in three colors of sauces. This is loud, hot, lipid-enriched, naughty, down-home stuff. If that's what heats your skillet, then go for it.	2001-03-27

I like it even better than &quot;Eight Weeks to Optimum Health&quot; and that's saying a lot. Dr. Weil doesn't believe in crazy dieting. Good for him. He does believe in healthy eating habits and can explain why certain fats are bad for you, and THEN he gives delicious recipes to substitute for things like french fries (oven-fried potatoes.) In fact, many of the recipes are very very good, especially the fish recipes.<br />He also debunks both the high-fat high protein diet and the very low fat (and difficult to maintain) diets as well.<br />In addition, the recommendations of food choices for various illnesses were helpful. When you finish reading this book, you are left with plenty of good suggestions to help you choose foods at home and when you eat out, and  you don't have to give up good things to live on rice cakes and seaweed puffs. This book is fun to read, too. What more could you ask for?	2001-03-26

He includes:<br />1. Section on the five elements (water-wood-fire-metal-earth), what &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; mean.<br />2. Section describing the most-used and important herbs like Ginseng and Dong Kwai, Ma Huang and many others. This section includes photos of the herb shown as they are sold in herb shops, tips on getting the best herbs, the Chinese name (and Korean, sometimes) The names are both Romanized and in Chinese characters, with the Latin name, and the active chemical components and their effects.<br />3. Formulae for herb tonics, because Chinese herbs are not used alone but in combination (and the reasoning behind the combination.)<br />4. Philosophy of Chinese medicine for health (prevention versus cure) and much more.<br />The book is very readable, too. While I very much like other books I own, this one is such a classic, I consider it a MUST-HAVE if you are interested at all in Chinese medicine and definitely the first one you should own.	2001-03-26

Lillian Too makes Feng Shui clear and a lot easier to understand than anyone else I have read. Her new book is subtitled &quot;168 Ways to Success, but has 179 different tips to get you started in Feng Shui, with very lovely illustrations.<br />While reading this book won't make you an expert overnight (that takes years of study and experience), it will get you started off right. You do need to purchase a compass (these are not expensive and can be found in camping stores in any mall.) The compass helps you can locate the good and bad areas of your office or home and take some action. For what ever reason, many people report that these tips seem to work.<br />On the more practical side, Feng Shui also teaches you to de-clutter your home. Clutter saps energy (as anyone who feels energized by walking into a newly-cleaned room can tell you.) One Chinese proverb say that, for good luck, you should move 27 things. This is one way to motivate kids or even yourself to pick up a room. Another good rule is to keep the lid down on the uh, throne in the bathroom. Not only does this prevent &quot;energy&quot; from leaving the house, it also is more sanitary.<br />Some people have reported that their business or worklife improves if they rearrange their office. While this isn't possible in everybody's workplace, there are other techniques in the book to change the flow of energy to improve things.<br />A bit of bio data on Lillian Too is interesting because she is so successful--she has an MBA from Harvard Business School, and was the first woman in Asia to become a Managing Director of a publicly listed company in Malaysia. She was  the first woman in Asia to become CEO of a Hong Kong bank. After she managed a chain of department stores, she left to become a mother, then started writing. She is now the top author on Feng Shui. (I guess her tips for success must work!)	2001-03-26

(This kid was leaning out of his stroller at 3 months of age, waiting to see the ducks on the river that runs through the center of town. He'd go wild when he saw them. Unbelievable. )<br />The slippers are so cute, you want to wear them too.<br />My only caution is that to get these darling designs, you need to knit intarsia. This is the method where you use a small bobbin or ball of color for the design patches and you do not strand as you do with fair-isle type knitting. That takes some practice. There are some good instruction books available to help you learn this useful and gorgeous technique.<br />Don't let fear of intarsia stop you. These sweaters are small projects because they are kiddie-sized and boy are they EVER cute. Enjoy.	2001-03-26

With many companies vying with each other to keep talented employees happy and productive, someone had to write a text to help managers become more effective in managing people as a true resource.<br />Three of the best parts of the book: 1. They interviewed and polled 80,000  managers. That is a HUGE sample. You are bound to find out some plain truths if you do this kind of work.<br />2. There is a questionnaire for employee satisfaction. Since some of the questionnaires I have seen in the past can actually IRRITATE you (they force you into an answer you'd rather not give or don't ask what you want to tell) this is useful stuff, indeed.<br />3. The book suggests incentives for people who develop knowledge and expertise. Most companies financially reward the politically savvy who can negotiate the inside-track path to top management. The problem is that the top technical experts often disdain to play this game or dont' know how, and are left lower-paid, disgusted and ripe for the plucking by other firms who value their knowledge.<br />The last point is one that Peter Drucker made years ago; that we have to pay for talent as well as political muscle. (He suggested two tracks, one for people-managers and one for technical experts.)<br />Excellent, excellent book.	2001-03-26

The story centers around the animal citizens of an English riverbank. Each animal has a different personality, from easy-going Mole to the wise and wiley Badger, the spoiling-for-a-fight Weasels and of course boastful Toad, the owner of splendid Toad Hall who has too much money and too little sense to know what to do with it. The education of Toad by his well-meaning friends is a good lesson. The battle for Toad Hall near the end of the book is also exciting.<br /><br />The content is entirely suitable for kids. The prose is a pleasure to read out loud and creates such pictures in one's imagination. And it's funny, too (the scene where Toad is nearly struck down by a car, which he has never seen before, and decides he MUST have one is absolutely hysterical.)<br /><br />If you are starting a reading-out-loud program at home, this should be at the top of your list. I'd also add Swiss Family Robinson to that list. I have wonderful memories of my teachers and parents reading these books to me. Why not give your kids the same lasting delight in good literature, reading and family fun.<br /><br />Note: suitable for grades 4-8 and the writing is somewhat complex, so some 4th graders will find it a rough go.	2001-03-26

That's the beauty of the slow cooker. Problem is, not every regular recipe works in the crockpot. The evaporation of water is less in a closed pot than in a rapidly boiling pan on the stove. That's is why your favorite stew recipe may come out watery when you make it in the crockpot.<br />This book has two of my favorite recipes (stuffed cabbage and barbecued brisket) that my mom made for us when we grew up, but perfected for the slow cooker. This means I can make favorites in the crockpot but know they will come out correctly.<br />The artichoke dip is great--and the slow cooker keeps it warm during a party. That's another great use of the crockpot. It can keep foods warm for parties and buffets.<br />I can't recommend this book enough; it really helps me get more out of the slow cooker and better results, too.	2001-03-24

I think Emeril Lagasse makes it clear that cooking is fun, an art and a way to express yourself.<br />He doesn't give cup and tablespoon amounts on his show when he cooks, so this book is useful to see what might go into some of the dishes he's created. So you get his biscuit recipe here, where measurements are critical to success. And are they nice and light! This is now my favorite biscuit recipe because I never could get them fluffy rather than heavy and flakey.<br />You do have to read these recipes carefully; the goat cheese and leek cake attracted me because I love both these ingredients. However, it's listed as vegetarian but contains a LOT of bacon! Hahaha! Since when are pigs vegetables? (there are vegetarian substitutes for bacon, but I'll bet Emeril wouldn't touch them with a 10-foot pepper grinder!)<br />There's plenty of his unique wit in the book, so it's fun to read. This is not most useful cookbook I own, but for a few recipes, it is unsurpassed ....	2001-03-24

(and who cares if it doesn't fit the baby? Too big and just waitaminnit, that baby will swell amazingly to fit any sweater.) This is not the case with kids; they grow a bit slower, they are fussy about their clothes and the fit. So this is a useful book.<br />It has patterns for sweaters that can be used for either boys or girls, even has pants. The most useful section is on blocking and finishing and necklines. Necklines are tough; kids have bigger heads in relation to their bodies so it is well to understand how to fit a neck opening on kids.<br />I give the book 4 stars out of 5 because it specifies a lot of acrylic type yarns. (To be fair, the book also has some cotton as well.) If you read Elizabeth Zimmerman, she claims wool is better for kids even though it needs hand washing and that the best wool probably won't itch. If you like machine washing, then acrylic is your fiber. If you want extreme warmth, wool is better, and you can always substitute a wool yarn of equal weight to the ones specified in the patterns.<br />Oh, there's also a bit about charting your own designs, which is handy for people who want to knit HP sweaters and the like. Not a bad reference if you knit for your children, grandchildren or children of friends--or for charity, too.	2001-03-24

It has science-fiction; The Drs. Murray, parents of Meg, Charles Wallace and the twins) are scientists who are researching Time and Space. Dr. Murray takes a time trip and so do the kids.  There is also magic; a trio of \\"witches\\" shows up--Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, and they take Meg, her brother Charles-Wallace, and their new friend Calvin on an epic adventure.  It's also the story of a family with a deep trouble who nonetheless stay together, the story of a young girl who is just coming into adolescence with all the awkwardness and confusing feelings, and the story of a special little boy who is thought to be retarded by townspeople.    The symbology L'Engel uses is powerful and original; a giant brain who seduces those around it into surrendering their free will as an ultimate dictator; a shadow-like smog around planets that represents the presence of Evil, and a special young boy who is more than a genius; who is \\"something new\\" who nonetheless can be tempted to his own destruction by vanity.  Wrinkle in Time has a lot of fertile subjects for discussions between parents and children about good, evil, how we treat each other, and the choices we make. Ms. L'Engel often uses moral themes in her books and this one contains excellent subjects for discussions about kindness, good, evil, God, and being different, and about the destructiveness of gossip.    Wrinke in Time is like the Potter books in that it is about boys and girls in a magical or fantasy setting. It is unlike the Potter books because it does not focus on wizardry as a craft. Instead it presents the universe as full of wonder, and united by a titanic struggle of Good against Evil.

Charles-Wallace is very ill. His mother, Dr. Murray is a noted biochemist and is desperately trying to research a new, mysterious disease and Charles-Wallace may have it.<br />When Charles-Wallace announces &quot;There are dragons in your vegetable garden&quot; this is the start of a great adventure that is connected to Dr. Murray's research, Charles-Wallace's illness and of course, much more.<br />This is a good tale about rebellion and the maturation process, and about the seductive powers of Evil. As usual, L'Engle mergers moral subjects into pure fantasy with her skilled writing and wonderful characters.	2001-03-23

I am so used to ER4YT method, where you select foods based on your blood type) that it is almost second nature to me.<br />Now Dr. D'Adamo adds more information about life style, degenerative diseases, more info on minor blood types and secretor versus non-secretor to fine-tune the ER4YT way of eating.  This theory has a lot of proponents in Japan (where they have a similar theory that tries to predict actual behavior from blood type.) I don't think blood type is a solid indicator of behavior, but I definitely feel much, much better if I follow these guidelines. And maybe I will avoid some health problems down the road.<br />It isn't hard to avoid the foods and select from the list of beneficial or neutral foods. Beneficial foods are ones that actively will help your health; neutral foods are ok to eat, but have no special benefits. You can even indulge in the occasional &quot;avoid&quot; food once in a while if you are healthy. If you are ill, however, you can maximize your recovery by sticking to the beneficial and neutral foods. This is not a difficult way of life and this book has done me more good than any other diet or health book I ever read.	2001-03-23

So this book is a really good resource if you like to sketch and hike, or if you garden and want to make a beautiful record of what you see. This is also a great resource if you are getting into journal writing and want to put in pictures of plants and flowers (many people keep a garden record journal, for example.)<br />The instructions are very good, from how to draw and sketch plants to choices of color. There are good examples to copy to learn the technique. I don't think there is a better book on this subject, nor a more beautiful book.	2001-03-23

I was attracted to Dr. D'Adamo's idea that your blood type affects the functioning of your stomach, and that certain foods can actually make you unwell, and others lead to health. Here's what I found after one year of applying his ideas:<br /><br />I feel better and lose weight on vegetables, fish and rice. I can't digest milk, so have substituted some, but not a lot of yogurt. I absolutely cannot tolerate hot peppers (D'Adamo says the A type stomach is highly sensitive.) Peppers upset my stomach even though I like spicy dishes. Along with peppers, I am highly sensitive to any food which might be spoiled or contaminated, so I avoid buffets and walk out of any restaurant that looks less than super clean. I definitely cannot drink orange juice. Whole wheat never agreed with me. I lose weight on fish and rice. I gain it back if I eat meat and milk. So perhaps the theory that the type A stomach is overly sensitive is true?<br /><br />So many of the observations Dr. D'Adamo makes about my type (Type A) seem to apply quite strongly to me. This has let me avoid foods that really don't do me much good. I definitely feel much better and have more energy if I don't eat beef, pork or lamb. So I have substituted turkey, chicken, fish and mostly vegetarian dishes and when I stick to that, I feel just great.<br /><br />The theory behind D'Adamo's book is that certain substances in foods can cause cells to clump and make digestion and metabolism difficult. While this theory is not a proven one, it is interesting. D'Adamo has years of experience in alternative medicine, as did his father. While the scientific basis may be lacking according to the strict rules of proving hypotheses, Dr. D'Adamo has a wealth of empirical information--which is accummulated knowledge from what he observes.<br /><br />I think this book can make a big difference in your health and it's interesting to try it out. I got a benefit from it, more than from any other diet book, not for the weight loss, but for avoiding certain foods that don't agree with me. There is a bulletin board on the web for people who want to discuss their experiences with the ER4YT diet, should you want more information.on't agree with me.

What I like about the herbal drugstore is how it gives both the typical prescription drugs for common ailments, and the herbal alternatives. It also describes how the herbs are supposed to work (if it is known.) That alone sets this book apart from most other herbal references. This would be a terrific first book on the subject for anyone's home library and I think it adds a lot to my shelf on herbs.<br />There are good drawings of the herbs, sections on vitamins, excercises, nutrition, combining herbs with prescription medicines (some can interfere; tell your physician) and much more. Yet the book has a very well-designed format, clear print, good organization and is chatty and readable. What more could you ask for? If I could give this book 10 stars, I would.

Why didn't someone write this before!!!!	Wow! Finally, someone has written about the dirty little secret of dieting and fitness programs. Some people (whisper it) eat right, work out and yet....don't lose weight.<br />A friend of ours had the sleep apnea checked out. He was very overweight, to the point of threatening his life. He couldn't stick with any exercise program because he was horribly tired. He slept at work. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea, got a device to assist his breathing and now is awake at work and walking for exercise. We think this book saved his life.<br />Even very fit people sometimes plateau in their workout programs. Could it be a food allergy? Bad time of year? This book gives some important clues as to what might be holding you back. Even if your fitness and weight loss program is going fine, why not make sure you aren't being held back by one of these &quot;UFO&quot; or Unidentified Fitness Obstacles. Great, great book.	2001-03-20

Metabolize tells you why	I took one look at this book and bought it immediately. The idea that one person's metabolism is probably different than another person's makes a lot of sense to me. And why do all these fad diets assume that they work for every type of person on the planet?<br />First you take a self-test in this book to determine your type. Then you can figure out a diet based on relative amounts of certain nutrients you need. Apparently, certain nutrients have exact opposite effect in some people--a high protein, low carb diet may be absolutely WRONG for you. I sure would like to know that BEFORE I decide on a diet plan.<br />I also like the fact this book includes exercises, breathing exercises and recommendations for supplements and vitamins. The calorie levels are also set so you can pick one that suits your size and sex (not everyone should eat an extremely low calorie diet.) Of course the book also has sample menus, which are always helpful. Finally, the paperback edition is a reasonable size to fit in a purse or in a briefcase, meaning it can go with you anywhere.<br />I wasn't sure if I was Atkins, Pritikin or NO KIN to any of these (turns out I am mixed, so that is why I had trouble) This book is really excellent and I can recommend it to anyone who wants to lose weight and eat right.	2001-03-19

For example, the instruction on avalanche survival is actually really valuable; plenty of people get buried every ski season around the world and the author gives a quick, simple instruction. This actually could save your life if you ski.  The earthquake advice is also a good take-away. If you aren't familiar with earthquake drill and are visiting an earthquake-prone area, you will know what to do.<br />What also is good about Worst-Case Scenarios is that it has you THINK about situations and vicariously problem-solve. This exercises your brain to think about how you might react in more mundane emergencies. That's good training.<br />And finally, this book is very interesting as a party icebreaker. Read a situation out to a group and ask them to pose a solution (readers of the book must be disqualified, of course.) Then compare the group's solutions with author Piven's recommendation. That's sure to get the conversation flowing.	2001-03-17

It is a fictious account of the family of Vermeer, the Dutch master who painted luminous, sunlit portraits of people caught in a moment. Seeing a Vermeer painting is to enter another world through a magical peephole. This book is similar. It is not large, it is not populated on a grand scale with princes, kings and battles.<br />Author Chevalier brilliantly puts a story to one of Vermeer's paintings, that of a young woman with a pearl earring, her hair wrapped in a swath of blue and yellow cloth. The theme is jealousy, sometimes over the petty. The story makes you turn time and time again back to the cover to look at the painting, each in a new light depending on the events in the story.<br />The novel really centers on Griet, a daughter of a tile painter who is injured in a kiln accident, is sent to work at Vermeer's house. She must please the head housekeeper, Vermeer's wife, her young daughters and her formidable but sympathetic mother, and of course Vermeer himself. Life in the Holland of Vermeer is portrayed, the seething jealousies, the stark life of the rich versus the common people and the world of Vermeer's art all come together on a fascinating canvas.	2001-03-17

I always liked Denise Austin's low impact aerobics tapes because they were sane and do-able. Now, Austin provides the same type of good advice in a book that is head and shoulders above other &quot;after 40&quot; books I have read.<br />The theme of Fit and Fabulous After 40 is how to get into the groove of habits that set you up for great health. One important one Austin puts in the book is to start up a four-week plan for exercise. This is important to avoid a lifetime of fitness attempts that are just a series of great beginnings and no follow-through. The inclusion of Kegel exercises is clever. While you are building good exercise habits, you can incorporate simple but valuable pelvic exercises that pay off big time later on.<br />Austin doesn't neglect eating habits and gives tips on avoiding trouble spots when you go to fast-food restaurants. Again, this helps you to build good habits.  And there are tips for getting into the habit of taking the right medical tests for preventative health care.<br />In my opinion, this is one of the best &quot;After 40&quot; health books ever written because it has not only the right information, but it presents it so you can develop good habits and keep them. Hurray, Denise! Good job!	2001-03-17

Munro or Saki (his pseudonym) wrote short stories with ironic twists and surprise, much like O. Henry.<br />You may have &quot;The Open Window&quot; in school, and  there are so many, many more funny, tart and twisted little gems in this volume. The famous Sredni Vashtar, the Lumber Room and the Open Window are known to most readers. In Sredni Vashtar, a young, neglected and abused boy who lives with a relative gets his odd revenge (this is a recurring theme with Saki, who himself was raised by two aunts who &quot;bellowed like mastodons across a primeval swamp&quot; at each other when piqued.)  &quot;The Occasional Garden&quot; is utterly delightful; here hapless ladies who lunch can one-up their snooty guests by subscribing to the Occasional Garden Club. For a few pounds a year, they can phone the club when The Envy of the Neighborhood is due to dine. A temporary garden, lush with pagodas, ponds and lemon groves is installed for the purpose of annoying any garden braggart. Of course, the club comes by to roll it right up when the guest leaves, and that can prove somewhat inconvenient.<br />Or what about Quail Seed, where a painter and a few actor-friends conspire to help a friend increase trade at his suburban grocery. Ladies who only infrequently shop at this sleepy store can't tear themselves away when day after day, an exotic boy with blue-black hair and a bowl of beaten brass instead of a basket stops in to collect an order for wine, figs, the &quot;best&quot; Smyrna halvah and quail seed, ever more quail seed. What is the meaning of this mystery--you'll find out.<br />There are so many more delicious morsels in this book. Reading each one is like unwrapping a chocolate bon-bon.	2001-03-11

(She claims she wasn't even aware of his high status until she saw the welcoming throngs as they debarked on the shore in Burma. Imagine that little surprise if you were a new bride!) Eventually, the prince raises her to official consort-princess status. They raise two daughters and are deeply revered by the Shan people.<br />Inge's husband, Sao Kya Seng disappeared after the 1962 coup which brought the military dictator Ne Win to power. They keep her cynically in the dark about his fate for a long time.<br />My only objection to this book is that the author's portrait of herself and her prince husband is quite a bit idealized. Truly great autobiographies are a bit more self-critical and introspective. This book is too &quot;fairy-tale&quot; and good to be true to life. That is why I give the book three stars and not more.<br />If you are interested in more about Myanmar (Burma) and how the current regime came to power, this is good reading, nonetheless. It will give you some historical background about why there is a huge conflict between the military regime in Yangon (Rangoon) and Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who is the dissent leader under house arrest.<br />The Shan state is one of many sub-nationalities that make up the very mixed Burmese nation. I was privileged to make a short visit to the Shan state a few years ago before it became difficult to do so. Burma was often called the Land of Regrets because it haunts people who visit and they long to return. It truly is the Land of Regrets. I hope things will change someday soon for the better, as it is a uniquely wonderful land.	2001-03-11

It is very pretty and would suit many types of decor, but you need to be able to do the same techniques as required to build your own picture frame.<br />If you sew, there are a couple of wonderful projects; a sashiko place mat (white quilting on blue indigo dyed cloth),an appliqued noren--which is a cloth door curtain hung on a dowel. The noren has a stunning design of floating carp done in scraps of a vintage silk kimono. but you certainly could use luxurious quilt fabrics. There are also some pillow patterns.<br />One of the best projects is a &quot;water garden&quot; which is really a fountain. With a small electric water pump and the skills to build a wood box, you can make your own indoor fountain and add rocks and plants to suit yourself. There is also a bamboo coffee table base, a cedar wood bath mat tied with rope, a bamboo towel ladder and a simple bamboo soap dish. I give the book 4 out of 5 stars, not because I don't love it, but because you must have woodworking skills to do many of the best projects. Not everyone knows woodworking (when I went to school, girls were banned from wood shop. How times have changed.)	2001-03-11

This herbal reference is well-written because it includes: the common Western name of the herb, the Latin name, the romanized Chinese name and the name in Chinese characters.<br />Packages of Chinese herbs may be labeled with any of the above, so this is really helpful. There is also a wonderful section on the principles of Chinese medicine and how the traditional herbal preparations are made.

Author David Freeman includes that event and the Iditarod Sled Race, the World Cow Chip Throwing Championship in Beaver, Oklahoma, and the Carnival in Rio and New Orleans. He picked some of my dream events, and probably some of yours,too.<br />Of course, some of these events might considerably shorten the time between seeing them and expiring, as in the title; we were in Pamploma the week before the running of the bulls; those walls are NARROW, those cobblestones look mighty hard. Take part in a stampede ahead of irritated bovines? You do get to wear a snazzy white outfit with a red sash. They assure me that only a few people get gored every year (mostly the danger is from being trampled by the other enthusiastic participants.) We passed.<br />If you decide,however, that you absolutely MUST, once in your life, be chased by bulls and a few thousand of your closest friends, the book provides details on how to get there, restaurants and lodging, and website URL's. This is a very funny book, so even if you are an armchair adventurer, you'll have a blast.	2001-03-11

This little book (400 pages in paperbound volume) is so handy. It is such a good herbal reference because it lists individual herbs, herbal combinations, Chinese herbs and combinations (which is important, as Chinese herbs are almost always used in combination.) Common herbs as well as less familiar ones used in Western herbal medicine are included with much helpful detail.<br />The Chinese herbal section is better than those I have seen in many other books including ones solely on Chinese herbs. This section gives the Chinese and common name, alternative names, the action and the yin/yang (dry, moist) type of action. While not a comprehensive Chinese herbal and not a substitute for years of education in TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) the section on Chinese herbs is a very helpful reference.<br />There is a lot of information packed into this book.

Yet understanding the fiction of their time requires you read both the Brontes and Austen.<br />Finally, the highly original, almost haiku-like poems of Emily Dickenson complete this volume. What's the connection between all these works other than that they were authored by women? Each of these women blazed new trails in literature and each created work of such import that it must be read by anyone who wants to understand English literature.	2001-03-10

This book has just about everything you'd want to know about that bland little block, including the history and manufacture of tofu. It even tells you how to make it yourself. Well, I tried it and got perfectly fine tofu (and a heck of a lot of okara, the bean residue left from straining the soymilk.) I nearly destroyed the kitchen, but it was fun and I learned to appreciate going to the store and buying a refrigerated pack.<br />If you don't care to try tofu in its Japanese guise (they even eat it cold with a dash of soy sauce) then you can try scrambled tofu. This is a real God-send for people who mustn't eat eggs and who miss a good mushroom omelet.<br />And did you know there were so many kinds of tofu, from kinugoshi, which is custard-like and can be used to make a good pumpkin pie, to extra-firm, which can be barbecued with sauce (just the thing if you have a summer grill party and can't serve meat. Grill some eggplant, zucchini, corn and tofu instead.)<br />Not every recipe in this book is useful for everyone (yuba, or the dried skin of soymilk) sounds yummy but is not found outside of good Chinese groceries in urban centers. However, this book will give you new ideas to use tofu.	2001-03-10

While the BBC series is amusing, these stories are far more personal. You get to met Dr. Herriot (a pseudonym for James Alfred Wight) who starts as a young veternarian just out of school and joins a country practice. Cows get the better of him, the local Yorkshire farmers one-up him, he gets his car inevitably stuck in the mud and yet prevails as a caring, resourceful vet who loves his quirkly rural clients as much the animals he cares for. He also writes with such laugh-outloud humor and self-deprecation you just wish the book would go on and on. Fortunately, he wrote four more of these books (each named for a line in a hymn) and a memoir of his father, in whose practice he began. They really give you the flavor of rural life in England before and after WWII.<br />I can't believe these stories are 30 years old, and Dr. Herriot has passed on. Thankfully he left this legacy behind for us to savor. These are books to re-read on dreary days with a cup of tea or just when you really need something to lift your spirits.	2001-03-10

Soba is practically a sacred food in Japan, so I understand the author taking three years to learn to make these buckwheat noodles. A common wistful dream of many Japanese is to retire and own the ultimate soba-shop. It's near and dear to the Japanese soul.<br />If you want a change from wheat noodles, soba are light, refreshing and soothing. Cold soba in summer, with a pungent dipping sauce can revive you on even the most miserably humid day (and keep you out of a hot kitchen--they cook in 10 minutes.) They are quick to throw into a bowl of miso soup or clear broth.<br />After you explore this book, you might become a confirmed soba-holic. If you want further, more contemporary recipes for soba I also recommend Asian Pasta (Recipes from the Vineyards of Northern California)by by Leslie Mansfield.	2001-03-10

This book goes into background about Internet browsers, the internet itself and computer operating systems, a key point in the anti-trust lawsuit. And it does an equally thorough job of informing the reader about US anti-trust law. These details are essential to understanding the case against Microsoft, and they are presented here in a way that is detailed yet completely comprehensible.<br />This would be dry reading indeed if there were not also vivid descriptions of the players; Bill Gates, brilliant, visionary,self-absorbed and completely ill-equipped to play the high-stakes game of personality; the prosecutor, who has gotten himself the case of a lifetime and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, traditional and sober judge. What is surprising is how much Judge Jackson reveals in this book, as judges are notoriously close-mouthed.<br />The appeals process is now underway and it ain't over till it's over. If you want to be informed on a case that will literally affect the future of technology, it's well worth reading World War 3.0.	2001-03-10

Wharton reaches the heights achieved by England's George Eliot in Middlemarch. Age of Innnocence is considered one of the top 100 novels in the English language and I heartily agree.  The novel is set in the Golden Age of New York high society in the 1870's. Like Middlemarch,  manners and rigid conformity assure success. Love is an anomaly.<br />Newland Archer, rich and well-connected, is poised to marry May Welland. She is beautiful, suitable and pure. In fact she is compared to a Diana, goddess of the hunt. This is the virgin archetype, untouchable, pure and only desirable from a distance. Archer meets her scandalous cousin, the Countess Olenska. Olenska has committed the unforgivable and left her husband for another man. She is taboo. She is also older, wiser and sexual (more taboos.) Archer is irrestibly drawn to her and thus forms the conflict for the rest of the novel.<br />No one of her era writes of toxic marriages better than Wharton; she had her own tragic marriage to a man who used her fortune to set up a house for his mistress. And don't forget Wharton's equally famous novel Ethan Frome, about another toxic marriage that ends in grief.<br />Good news,by the way; Wharton's home in Lennox, MA, the Mount, is being restored. It's home to a resident theater that does some brilliant Shakespeare. If you have a chance to go, do so. It's a wonderful experience.	2001-03-10

This book is a real classic (mine is soup-stained from years of use.)<br />It is actually surprising how easy it is to make that cup of warm, cloudy soup you get in the sushi bar. The only problem is the dashi (fish broth) that is commercially available. It is usually loaded with MSG. You can make your own broth from bonito flakes per this book, if you have a Japanese grocery, but if you don't have a Japanese grocery or don't eat fish, vegetable broth works just fine with a dash of soy sauce.<br />This book has many, many soup ideas, as well as some delicious Asian noodle recipes, and uses for miso that replace things like cheese. The meaty taste of miso results from natural amino acids, which provide the savory flavor similar to meats and cheeses. If you are becoming vegetarian, miso can replace that familiar taste.	2001-03-10

Companies who create technological products frequently have brilliant success with the first two groups and then fall into a pit trying to get to the pot of gold on the other side of this rainbow, selling to the rest of the curve.<br />Crossing the Chasm details the important gap between Innovators and Early Adopters and then outlines a campaign strategy for crossing that chasm to mainstream marketing success. The book gives many examples of products that crossed the chasm successfully (such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft.)<br />Time and time again, technology companies fail because they are concerned with sales numbers (to please shareholders or investors) or because of a bean-counter mentality or simply insufficient funding. The author Geoffrey Moore uses D-Day and the taking of Omaha Beach as a powerful metaphor for how to establish a beachhead before assaulting the mainstream. Like the beaches of Normandy, high cost and certain losses can be essential to establishing the toehold that stages victory. Also important is the idea that to reach the mainstream market, vendors must provide the a complete solution, including support. This is an area that high-tech companies typically want to skimp on; the Innovator and Early Adopter types are natural pioneers and self-sufficient. These buyers accept a higher level of product problems and work-arounds. The mainstream majority buyers are pragmatic; they buy a product not for its own sake, or because it is &quot;cool.&quot; They buy to get a job done and want a product that does the job and does it trouble-free. A lack of service and complete solutions is one big reason technology firms fall into the chasm with an initially hot-selling product.<br />The book is not tremendously detailed, but gives clear, understandable examples of how to set up a strategy in order to target a market and select a &quot;must-have&quot; value proposition suitable to drive in a wedge. The most valuable part of the book, in my opinion is the advice on weathering the ongoing pressure of executive management reviews, which can constantly threaten to derail a bold yet workable plan.<br />This is must reading for anyone in the high-stakes technology market. It's an exciting game, and this book provides important strategies to win.ket and select a &quot;must-have&quot; value proposition suitable to drive in a wedge.

A party or restaurant? The cafeteria at work? Carry this miniature version of Dr. Shapiro's full version Picture Perfect Weightloss just for the most dangerous area; the dessert table.<br />I think this book is brilliant for dealing with temptations that occur when we go to social events. You can pull out this guide, sneak a peak and make a choice to fit in your weight loss plan. If you don't plan ahead, you end up rationalizing (it's just for today, I blew it so why not eat the entire eclair.) Instead you can look at the choices and decide to eat the tuile cookie with sorbet filling rather than the tiny but deadly chocolate mousse.<br />Some of the weekly diet meeting groups stress planning ahead for holidays and celebrations. This book lets you plan ahead by actually seeing the foods you are facing and letting you make the choice intelligently. And if you didn't get to plan ahead (someone brings a cake to work, you are hungry and want a sweet) you can pull the book out of your pocket or purse and quickly decide how to react. What a great idea.	2001-03-08

Most people absorb information best when it is visual (which is why television has such an impact.)  The photos in the book immediately communicate to you what you can have, how much of it you can have and what it's worth in relative food value. This is far easier than having to intellectualize what fat grams, carbohydrate grams or calories actually mean in terms of what goes into your mouth.<br />Some fad diets work because they trick dieters into reducing the total amount they eat by restricting when they can eat something(food combining) or by eliminating one entire group of foods (extreme low fat, low carb.) While the theory may be interesting, the net effect is people who follow these schemes just end up eating less. One of the effects of stringent diets that eliminate certain foods also is to cause the dieter to constantly focus on what they CAN'T have. This builds up tension, and when stressful situations hit, the urge to break loose and have a forbidden treat is hard to resist. Ultimately, boredom sets in, and it is almost impossible to maintain such a regime once the weight comes off. People naturally go back to eating the foods they miss and the weight comes back.<br />Now here is a refreshing idea. Shapiro uses pictures to illustrate the food value of fruits versus prepared snack bars, breads versus cereal snacks. He doesn't say &quot;don't eat the snack bar&quot;, instead he provides a visual comparison so you can make an informed choice quickly.<br />This system allows you to develop better eating habits by training you to grab bulky vegetables, fruits, whole grain breads instead of muffins, cereal bars and and high-sugar, low fat cookies. By getting more to eat, you can eliminate hunger. Allowing free choice means you can learn to control what you eat and not feel you are constantly deprived. This is a system for learning to live with food realistically and in a healthful manner. This book also fits in well with the commercial diet groups that meet weekly and stress lifetime eating habit changes.commercial diet groups that meet weekly and stress lifetime eating habit changes.	2001-03-08

And calling on decision-makers (VITO's) requires some real guts, and also some special know-how.<br />The problem with most sales trainings is that they say &quot;call on the decision-makers&quot; but neglect to teach you the right way to reach that person. Many large firms now have preferred-vendor programs and limit from whom they will buy; if you aren't on the &quot;A&quot; list, you won't even get in the door. So if you tend to call on the end user or the purchasing manager, you may find you have trouble making sales except to your established customers. Real explosive sales growth comes from developing new customers, and if you sell important services or capital equipment, or even supplies you should be talking to the decision-makers.<br />Important people have rings of handlers, gatekeepers and other systems to protect their time and attention. You might have just the product that will save their company money, streamline their production, solve a pressing problem and be just what they are looking for. But if you don't have the tools to get your message across to the man or woman who can make it happen, they may never find out.<br />Years ago, I had sales training done by a VP of a successful firm. He explained how to contact top decision makers by making yourself be seen as a mutually beneficial business partner. For example, the book explains how to write a value proposition in a letter that explains how you can provide mutual benefits, without trying to get an in-person sales call. It also explains how to deal with the gatekeepers--they've heard it all, seen it all, so you'd better be treating the VITO's admin assistant as if he or she were the top officer themselves. And it gives important info on using the phone--phone skills can be more effective than sales calls. This book is a tremendous resource for training people to break out of their habits and reach the customer who can really make things happen.is a tremendous resource for training people to break out of their habits and reach the customer who can really make things happen.	2001-03-08

She also wrote an incredibly good autobiography, Through the Narrow Gate, which describes her own search for God and truth. All her books are written for the general reader to get a good overview of these religious topics. Now she has written A Biography of Buddha, to continue the series on understanding the world's major beliefs.<br />It's questionable whether the Buddha himself would have sanctioned a biography; he definitely preached against the cult of personality. Instead his life and principles were devoted to avoiding authority cult figures and instead taking a personal path to develop enlightenment. However, his life as a teacher gives a good example about how he took his path to becoming the Enlightened One and it is also an important story for those who want to understand his influence over most of the East.<br /><br />Buddha was 29 when he chose to leave his comfortable home (parents, ife and new baby son) and take up a life of searching for truth. At this time in India, many people took up a life of asceticism in order to find the true meaning of life and even to this day this strong tradition continues; you can see holy men in India who own only a loincloth (or not even that much) who wander the land, seeking and teaching and getting their daily bread from donations. The search for spiritual enlightenment is deeply rooted in Indian tradition.<br /><br />After a period of time of self-mortification, which he found was ineffective in achieving enlightenment, Buddha took the middle path and sitting under the famous Bo tree, found enlightenment.<br /><br />As Buddha wandered, he developed his principles and began to teach them widely. He had followers and was friend to kings and noblemen. He taught 8 principles, some of which seem Christian in nature (ie compassion) and which he himself said were ancient teachings that he merely re-discovered and wished to teach.<br /><br />Armstrong explains the background of the times when Buddha lived and taught; this gives insight into his development. This is a good short biography to understand Buddhism in the light of its founder and the times in which it arose in India.ich he himself said were ancient teachings that he merely re-discovered and wished to teach.

So you can learn about knitting lace and then use this book afterwards to design your own things. So you won't outgrow this book. There is also some knitting history included in the book, for fun reading<br />There are designs for edgings and cloths. Edgings are great added to towels (makes a great gift--take a handtowel and sew on a handknitted lace edging or sew a lace insertion, which is knitted with two straight edges instead of one scalloped one and sew it onto the towel.) They are also a good learning tool for lace knitting, as they repeat a lot, and if you goof up on cotton edging yarn, you can just rip it out and begin again.<br />The author is also a designer of cross-stitch patterns. She has patterns for cross-stitch (no knitting) at her site ....	2001-03-05

This book has a Rose pattern that looks great knitting up in wool yarn for a shawl, as well as in thinner cotton for a table cloth. This book isn't really suitable for a beginner; if you are new to lace knitting, I recommend Martha Waterman's book first, then move on to this one.<br />These lace patterns make great baby christening blankets for an important gift, or a wedding shawl.<br />If you make a tablecloth, you can take a simple cardboard decorators table, drape it with a plain round of colored or neutral polished cotton and then put a handknitted tablecloth on it and have an accent piece that is incredibly beautiful (a decorator table has a cross-base and round top made of particle board or cardboard. You can put a glass round on top, but it isn't necessary. They are very inexpensive.) This is especially nice if you have Victorian or country decor.	2001-03-05

Shawls are very &quot;in&quot; right now, and nothing is more stunning than a lacy shawl in a great color. Martha Waterman's book is very unique in that it has a little something for every knitter; if you are new to lace knitting, there are some not-very-difficult but really nice-looking shawl patterns. Some are written out row by row if you don't like charts (I do like charts--the symbols are quicker to read for me, but some people do not prefer them.) If you are an experienced knitter, this book is like a toolbox with various shawl shapes (round, half-circle, square, triangle, oblong) and stitch patterns in a small but useful lace library. You can combine the stitches and shapes and make your own creations. So you won't outgrow this book.<br />If you like to follow patterns, the Kerry Blue Shawl is just terrific. It is a square shawl with various lace stitches, and is knit from the center outwards, with four diagonal &quot;rays&quot; at the corners. This is actually a very easy shawl but looks like an heirloom. It would work as a baby christening wrap also. The Kerry Blue Shawl is written out row by row, for those who eschew charts.<br />Because lace knitting doesn't need to &quot;fit&quot; you can use all kinds of yarns of various weights.  Find a yarn, test out how the stitch looks, and &quot;guestimate&quot; the yards you will need by comparing the yardage and gauge used in the pattern. If you run low, you can make the shawl a bit smaller.<br />I have quite a few lace knitting books, but I actually use this one the most.  I just love this book!	2001-03-05

Here's a book you will just love	I adore this book. It isn't hard to find lace patterns where I live (Europe) We have issues of knitted lace patterns on the newstands everywhere. But these patterns are just, well, WOW. The floral centers of the round knits are much more &quot;realistic&quot; and beautiful than the average doily.<br />Now, you can make doilies and tablecloths if you like from these patterns, but you can also make them in a fine laceweight wool  yarn and have a shawl that is absolutely stunning. The cover picture pattern actually would make an incredible wedding veil/shawl from very fine silk or merino wool yarn. And a baby christening blanket from one of these patterns would become a family heirloom (I've given handknitted gifts to my friends with new babies, and one of them washed the item and shrink-wrapped it so his son will have it when he grows up.)<br />This is NOT a book for beginners; if you haven't done lace knitting before, you should probably start with another book (I like Martha Waterman's book on lace shawls.) But after you get the hang of knitting lace, this book will feed the lace fever. It is a treasure.	2001-03-05

The amazing thing is how relevant the book still is to software product development. If you are involved in software, this book is a must-read.<br />The most valuable part of the book, I believe, is the &quot;plan to throw out&quot; prototype chapter. While the goal is always to make a bigger, better, fast whatever, it is almost an axiom that you WILL build something that has to be discarded and reworked. This absolutely happens every time, I can tell you from  first-hand experience. Therefore it is vital to plan to throw out so you can migrate your users to whatever will follow. If you dream that the first product is THE ONE, you risk abandoning them on a product that will inevitably evolve. Planning the throw-away also helps meet the schedule goals by setting reasonable milestones that can be met.<br />In my role as a product manager for a top-selling software product in its class, I found that the Mythical Man-Month was absolutely vital. However, some additional reading is recommended; Walker Royce's Software Project Management was published in 1998 and adds the dimension of software project evolution. This goes into more detail why you can't write all the specifications upfront, and even if you do, they are certain to change by the time the product is released.	2001-03-05

His matter-of-fact offer to buy Barry, a fat kid with a high IQ instigates a congressional inquiry.<br />Meanwhile, Jones skillfully garners support from every quarter in Pequod, from the pioneer-stock, six foot female principal of the elementary school and Barry's closest ally, to his own mother, a slatternly lower class housekeeper who's obviously the source of Barry's brains. Everyone has an opinion about Barry, usually not too good, ranging from jealousy, misunderstanding to just plain contempt (he's fat.) Meanwhile Barry and his street-wise blue collar friend seek to prevent his sale by a hilarious act of sexual misconduct.<br />What happens to the children purchased by U. Lymphomiloid is openly discussed by Wissy Jones during the trial. Yet despite the shocking revelation, Jones has manipulated the town to his side and even co-opts some surprising allies.<br />This isn't just an examination of an education system that strives to produce a bland mediocrity and mistrusts talent, it is the story of the intolerance of society for individuals and members of minority religions, race, anyone different than the mass average.

His method of putting out books was unscrupulous to say the least. Willy Villiers would gather a group of inpecunious writers and re-label their works as his own and then publish them. One day, he suggested to his young wife that she write a few &quot;juicy tales&quot; of her school days. Colette complied, but the work didn't suit Willy. He threw the manuscript in a drawer and forgot all about it. A few years later, he ran across it, read it, and exclaimed that he must have been a complete dolt. The book was published (under his name) and took Paris by storm.<br />Colette's somewhat (for those times) racy tale of schoolgirls in a provincial town was followed by the story of Colette's move to Paris and her marriage to a much older man. The books not only capture the flavor of the times but also create a very quirky French character, Claudine, who at all times remains true to herself and opinion be damned.	2001-02-28

She is &quot;unpicked and remade&quot; in the mold of a well-bred, well-educated Catholic young lady. However, Nanda is never quite one of the group; her father is a convert to the faith and middle-class. Most of the students are daughters of old Catholic gentry and Nanda feels the subtle discrimintation. <br />Yet Nanda loves the hermetic routine, her companions and the age-old routine of the school. She begins to feel very at home, and excels her studies when she makes a terrible mistake.<br />The sensitive treatment of a young girl's feelings and attitudes, the recreation of the rarified atmosphere of a convent in pre-war England make this book a fine piece of literature. Antonia White wrote 3 more novels, all semi-biographical and then a few other short works. She was afflicted by writer's block and her output is slim, which is a shame. She was a tremendously talented writer, and every word is crafted perfectly.	2001-02-28

The Linnet children sent to live with their grandmother after the death of their mother. Their father is off in Egypt, serving as an officer in the army. But the children can't accept the rigid rules and structured life that Grandmother lays down for them and they escape from the house in a stolen pony cart. The pony leads them to the house of a gruff but kindly old gentleman who grudgingly allows them to stay overnight. They don't know it, but the formidable gentleman is their very own uncle, who is a vicar and bachelor. And also a scholar and famous educator. They are allowed to stay only under the condition that they be educated. And here begins a magical adventure, with spells with the somewhat bewitching and ancient Emma Cobb, the folk-wise Ezra, who is the vicar's sexton and factotum, a mysterious hermit who can't talk and an old lady who walks in her mansion garden only by moonlight. The Linnet children absorb the difficult classical Greek education of their scholarly uncle every morning, and have adventures in the afternoon. Eventually, they unravel the mysteries that surround them and everyone lives happily ever after.<br />This is a lovely story and filled with love, good natured fun and a bit of fairy tale. If you like the Potter books, this story is one you will also enjoy with your kids.	2001-02-27

But if you don't want to open yet another jar of tomato sauce, you can grab this cookbook instead. That's what I do. I look in the fridge and take inventory of the vegetables, and then open the book and see what I can make. We end up eating a lot more healthy veggies and low-fat sauces because we use this book. I got it as a gift and I have to say, it's just about the most-used book in the kitchen.<br /><br />It happens to make a very nice present in a basket with some boxes of fancy pasta, a few decorative vegetables and a couple of nice, woven towels in an Italian theme. And a bottle of red wine, too.	2001-02-27

Contests were being held all over the US for best chili. Every weekend you could find a Chili Cook-off or Chili Tasting anywhere from hot-pepper-hating New England to 12-alarm-fire-chili-loving Texas. Even the Simpsons ended up doing a chili cook-off spoof (The Guatemalan Insanity Pepper episode is really great animation and very funny, too.)<br />I have made many of the chilis in the book, going so far as to buy the required chili pequenos, chili colorado and other special chilis in the recipes. Yes, they make a difference. And the book even has Cincinnati 5-Way Chili, which purists will scorn as &quot;not REALLY chili&quot; but which is addictive and great for guests who hate hot spices. (5-way chili is a slighty sweet, cinnamon spiced chili probably influenced by Middle-East immigrants in Cincinnati. It is served 2-way, 3-way or 5-way with onions, beans, cheese, and spaghetti. It's fun for kids, who can make up their own garnished dish.) The Texas Style hot chilis are really gorgeous. This is one of my all-time favorite books and I don't think in 20 years, anyone has really written a better book on chili than Jane Butel.	2001-02-26

This book is a story of her desert semi-nomad life, the story of the horrifying practice of Pharonic circumcision of women that she suffered, and Dirie's escape from several oppressive situations ultimately to a better life.<br />The practice of female circumcision or FGM (female genital multilation) is not well-understood by Europeans and Americans. The practice, though not ordained by the Koran, is common in parts of Islamic Africa. It may have had tribal origins before some of the lands became Islamic. Dirie gives a blunt description of the primitive practice that leads to the death of many girls and to constant pain and suffering for those who survive it.<br />In addition to the story of FGM, Dirie also tells how she escaped her engagment to a man she didn't know, how she got to London to live with relatives, only to escape virtual enslavement and ended up working at a MacDonalds. From there, fame and success.<br />This book is written well, in a plain but well-told style. In addition to enlightening people about FGM, it tells a story of great courage.	2001-02-26

While there isn't any reason not to make the Pasta Puttanesca or Lemon Chicken any old time, this book has recipes that seem to work really well for parties, including small dinner parties.<br />The desserts are especially sumptuous (carrot cake is always a hit, I like the apple tart with cider glaze) and the chicken dishes are especially fine. I like chicken for party dishes as it gets around the &quot;no red meat&quot; problem, can be as elegant as you wish (Cornish hen recipe here, for example) or can hold in the oven without damage.<br />In short, if you want to give an elegant party and are tired of your usual recipes, this book is really great.	2001-02-26

The Crystal Singer series by Anne McCaffrey is my favorite set of McCaffrey's novels. The story is imaginative and truly is sci-fi (not fantasy.) The story revolves around Killashandra, a failed opera singer who runs off with a Crystal Singer after failing her final exams to qualify as a performer (book one.) She becomes a Crystal Singer, or miner of Ballybran quartz, a special mineral with many uses and properties only found on the secretive world of Ballybran that is run by the equally secretive and powerful Heptite Guild.<br /><br />Book One centers on Killashandra's training and first success as a Crystal Singer. Book Two (Killashandra) continues her story and sends her to the world of Optheria. Optheria has a music festival once a year on their unique organ, a massive instrument powered by white crystal and that is found nowhere else in the universe. The main console of the organ, however, was destroyed and new crystals have to be installed. Killa has cut them and now is on the way to install them. But there is more to Optheria than just music. A complaint has been lodged against them, a serious one, and Killashandra is charged with the task to investigate what is going on there.<br /><br />I won't put in any plot spoilers but a lot of things happen to Killashandra, with twists and turns in the story that are quite enjoyable. The surprises continue right up to the end and set up the story for the final book (Crystal Line.)<br /><br />\\"Killashandra\\" also avoids what I call \\"middle of the trilogy syndrome\\" where the middle book of the three in a trilogy is the weakest one. This book vies with Crystal Singer for great plot and storyline.  The entire series is excellent and one of my utter favorites.	2001-02-24

Killashandra  astonishingly finds out that the reaction to the quartz is like the link shock (Book 1) when she assists the team investigating how crystal and the \\"Jewel Junk\\"--the nickname for the alien species, interact. Meanwhile, she also learns that the Guild (after many decades) is in decline.<br /><br />Their maturing relationship, Lars' career with the guild, and dealing with the memory loss that singers are subject to, plus wrapping up the story make for an interesting novel. It is not my favorite in the trilogy, but it is a fitting end to this very satisfactory series.	2001-02-24

She expanded the story in Crystal Singer,which is the first of a trilogy of novels.<br />Killashandra fails her final exam in music school and faces a life of second-billing as a choir soloist and not a top performer as she had dreamed. She will not settle for second place, and impetuously takes off with a mysterious companion for Ballybran, a forbidden planet with an alluring secret.<br />Ballybran is the home of Crystal, which is mined and used for vital starship drives, interplanetary communications systems and most other types of equipment. It is controlled by the powerful and secretive Heptite Guild. Killashandra applies for membership and is accepted. She goes through the intensive schooling and special adaptation to become a Crystal Singer.<br />But singing Crystal has not only its rewards (and they are many) but its heavy price. Killashandra learns about the price as she becomes a full-fledged member of the Heptite Guild and becomes involved with its enigmatic Guildmaster Lanzecki.<br />This is one of those wonderful kinds of sci-fi novels that can create an entirely new world, complete with its slang, customs and characteristics. It's sci-fi at its best.	2001-02-24

Benson	Tom Holt has moved Lucia to the days of Winston Churchill and WWII.  He wrote this sequel to the Lucia novels after E.F. Benson passed on, and I must say, he did an admirable job of catching the dialog exactly. You'd swear that Benson wrote this book.<br />The plot is predictably Lucia, who seeks to gain local social prominence, this time amongst the officers who are heading off to war. Their staff of servants (cook especially) are off doing important wartime work and Lucia and Georgie must fend for themselves. Georgie turns out to have a flair for the kitchen, even with wartime rationing and a surfeit of parsnips. He escapes from Lucia's domininance to shine on his own. Which leads to the triumphant end of the book, and a dinner for a certain cigar chomping notable.<br />Sad this is out of print, so seek one out. If you are a Lucia addict, this book will add to your enjoyment.	2001-02-24

Jethro Kloss ran santitaria (we'd probably call them spas or detox centers today) in Wisconsin and Minnesota. He lectured, wrote and founded a whole-foods manufacturing company in Tennessee.<br />If you read Back to Eden, you'll see that Jethro Kloss was way ahead of his time. He advocated a diet high in fruits, vegetables and grains and with minimal meat, caffeine, fat and sugars. Some of his treatments will seem dated (fomentations or hot packs) but some are still in use in holistic healing centers around the world today.  He also recommended living a spiritually healthy life, realizing again that health comes from a totally integrated lifestyle, where body, mind and spirit are in harmony.<br />This is a great book to have if you like reading Dr. Weil, Deepak Chopra or other current popular health authors. It gives perspective into health ideas that have stood the test of time. The home remedies are helpful, too. This is still a great reference for home health and has many good recipes for salads, soups and breads.	2001-02-24

Goats milk is naturally homogenized.<br />There are countless kinds of goat cheeses, but the most common kinds found in American grocery stores and specialty markets are excellent for many purposes. But since goats milk cheese (chevre) is different than cows milk cheese, this cookbook is a great idea to know how to use it. The Brennans are a mother-daughter team with experience raising goats, making cheese and writing for culinary publications.<br />Some of the great recipes in this book are Peppered Ribeye steak with goat cheese, Grilled Eggplant and Goat Cheese Rolls, and Poached Winter Pears with Sweet Goat Cheese--which is my personal favorite along with warm goat cheese salad. The book also has a short history of the cheese and a guide to the types of goat cheeses. Although a specialty book, I turn to it often for dinner parties because goat cheese adds such elegance to a menu and because it can substitute for a meat course if you are entertaining vegetarians who eat dairy products.	2001-02-23

One of the great secrets of watercolor painting is NOT to overwork a painting; hence, one hour (more or less) is enough. If you begin to overwork the painting, you run the risk of ruining it.<br />This book has no drawing instructions; if you are weak in drawing skills, pick up a drawing course book (they can really help) or use the suggestion in the book to project slides on a wall or to use an opaque projector. If that sounds like &quot;cheating&quot; be comforted that many professional artists use these tools to help, especially when doing large super-realistic paintings. Don't worry that this is &quot;tracing&quot; because the work of putting paint to paper takes skill and practice. It is NOT coloring book work.<br />This book also gives important advice about paper and paints; this is helpful as using the wrong paper will just frustrate you. In addition it helps to copy some of the exercises in the book and follow the stages of putting the layers of paint on. This again isn't &quot;coloring book&quot; copying; copying work is a very good artistic exercise to learn technique.<br />In short, if you are starting watercolor, this is an excellent book to try.	2001-02-23

Nevertheless, Le Guin can create new worlds and new cultures that are unsurpassed by any other science fiction author.<br />The Left Hand of Darkness is set on Gethen, or Winter, a planet that has arctic conditions most of the year. An envoy, Ai, from the Ekumen of Worlds is sent to explore whether Gethen would join the Ekumen and engage in intellectual exchange of ideas and technology.  Gethen is also unique in that the people are unisexual, changing to female or male form on a monthly cycle called kemmer. How Le Guin handles a unisex race is one of the amazing parts of the book.<br /><br />Ai sets out to live on Gethen, first in the country of Karhide. He attempts to convince the (somewhat mad) king of the value of joining the Ekumen, helped by a counselor of the King, Estraven. But Estraven is undermined by another court counselor and is  banished, and Ai is in terrible danger and doesn't realize it. As Ai explores the rest of Gethen and its varied societies, he is helped again and again by Estraven, whom he at first mistrusts. Their heroic trek across the Ice of Gethen reads like the best arctic explorers adventure from Earth.<br /><br />This is an exciting book, though the beginning is slow, as Ai begins to understand the strange society of Karhide and Gethen. As the adventure unfolds, you will not be able to put the book down. This is a classic that should be read by anyone who loves science fiction, and is a book that can be re-read many times with great enjoyment.	2001-02-22

Their founding philosophy is based on the writings of Odo, a woman who never sees the moon colony created on her ideas, which are based loosely on pure Communism. Odonianism tries to change human nature, by inculcating the principle of sharing and non-possesiveness, with the interesting twist of removing the possessive word &quot;mine, ours&quot; from language and substituting &quot;the one I use.&quot; The Odonians create a somewhat impoverished but vigorous society on the moon Anarres and for two centuries have been isolated from their Urras roots except for trade contact at the spaceport. In fact, Anarres is a mining colony for Urras and is left alone as long as valuable minerals are shipped back to the mother planet.<br />The Anarresti use a language created by a computer and using their philosophical beliefs. People when born are given a two syllable name from the computer. The society is free, all sexual activity is allowed as long as the partners agree. Marriage is not uncommon, but not the norm either. Children are raised communally, a bit like the first kibbutzim in Israel. Work is assigned from a labor pool with a computerized system of allocating assignments wherever they are needed. But anyone can choose any occupation that suits them, and is free to refuse a posting, or even work at all. Once in every ten days, an Anarresti participates in volunteer labor that's needed by the community.  Only a sense of responsibility, taught from birth, a conscience, keeps everyone working for everyone else and free from &quot;propertarianism&quot; or the desire to accumulate possessions and wealth. People are free to move around, choose their work, choose partners and do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt others.<br />This Utopia has seeds of destruction, however. Individuals are quashed by &quot;syndicates&quot; or groups controlling various occupations. New ideas are &quot;egoistic&quot; and suppressed. The main character in The Dispossessed, a brilliant physicist named Shevek, has suffered this isolation and discouragement from childhood on. His brilliance is fostered however, by two special teachers, one of whom is another such isolated and unappreciated brilliant mind. When he goes to Abbenay, the capital, to work at the central institute, he becomes aware of the jealousy, conservatism and backbiting that are undermining their utopia. He also embarks on a major discovery in physics, that is rejected by the institute, but greatly coveted by the physicists and industrialists on Urras. He's invited to finish his work on Urras and to accept a prize equivalent to a Nobel. No one from Anarres has gone to Urras in two centuries and a conflict of huge proportions erupts, against the backdrop of a heartbreaking drought and famine on Anarres.<br />How the conflict is ultimately solved, and how the Utopia is forever changed makes for some exciting reading. The book is a good examination of the question whether it is possible to set up a completely unselfish society and what the eventual outcome might be based on human nature. This is one of Le Guin's best books, and written in spare, beautiful language that describes the people, the landscape and the drama in a most memorable way.istic&quot; and suppressed.

Le Guin is a prize-winning author of science fiction novels. She runs writers workshops and this is a book of exercises such as you would encounter in one of her work groups. I love her fiction works, but this book is one of my favorites as it sheds a new light on what makes someone's writing really wonderful--without losing the magic behind the screen. I end up giving this book as gifts to friends who enjoy writing. Every one of them has said that they didn't know about this book but were very glad to read it.<br /><br />As for me, I re-read this all the time. It has a lot of interesting points--such as the rhythm of your writing. The examples Le Guin uses for good writing--such as Virginia Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse\\" shed new light on why great writers are great. Another chapter discusses \\"being gorgeous\\" or using the flow of adjectives. She gives another exercise in on being abstemious with the use of adverbs. (Ultimately, avoiding \\"Tom Swifty?\\" No, just tightening up writing and letting the action speak for itself. A great exercise.)<br /><br /> At the end of the book are ideas for starting writers' groups and workshops of your own. A friend who writes (whom I gifted this book to) said he has a critical reading group. They pass around samples of each's others recent work and go over the nuts and bolts: \\"Why did you have the character do this?\\" \\"Why is this word here?\\" He says it really improves your writing, and this book could really assist such a group, if you start one.<br /><br />If you like to write fiction, or want to, or just love to read great fiction, I think this is a must-read. One of my favorite books. Wish it were on Kindle.	2001-02-22

So when I started a garden in our New Hampshire backyard, even though I had a half acre to work with, I used this book and the square foot principles.<br />There is no reason to create a monster patch of garden if you are only going to have to give away those hundreds of zucchini (people in our town make sure to close their car windows in August, lest passersby fill their auto with their surplus squashes.)  The square-foot garden method uses square plots, starting with a 4-foot square, that's all.  This book gives you the right number of plants per square to put in each for a typical family. We love lettuce, so devoted more squares to lettuce; and you'd be surprised how few tomato plants you actually need. A married couple with no kids can actually garden in a 4 foot square, which is also helpful for those living in condos or doing terrace or balcony gardening. This method is somewhat related to French intensive agriculture, where a huge crop can be grown in a relatively small space.<br />Another reason to square-foot garden is to have enough compost to enrich the soil. I never ever have enough of this black gold, even though we compost all our vegetable scraps and grass clippings. (A friend went so far as to strike a deal with the local organic vegetarian restaurant for their scraps to have enough.)  And weeding is a lot easier in a small square than on a long, endless furrow.<br />This is one of my favorite garden books.

Here's why I always recommend Martin Yan's books; for some reason, his recipes will result in that authentic taste that is often missing from other Chinese or Oriental cookbooks. He gives techniques that really work, like marinating chicken or meats in a cornstarch-soy sauce mix that give the meat that succulent coating when stir fried. Yet most of the recipes can be made with ingredients found in a majority of American grocery stores that stock a foreign food shelf and some exotic vegetables like sprouts and chinese cabbage.<br />I learned to cook Chinese food as a kid from my Dad (he bought an enormous wok right from a restaurant in San Francisco in the 60's. It was so big we had to store it in the garage. But that was the only kind there was, no one sold them in the kitchen department until much later.) We used to make fried rice and Chinese egg omelets (egg fu yung) that tasted like the Chinese restaurants we loved. But it wasn't until I found Martin Yan's cookbooks that I found any book that could duplicate that flavor.	2001-02-22

I work and coming home to face a pile of raw ingredients that somehow must be converted into a dinner is pretty depressing sometimes. Besides, I'm hungry too!<br />Many people don't think of the pressure cooker as a tool for speedy cooking, but you can make delicious stews (try the one in this book, it's wonderful) and other roasts and one-pot dishes really quickly. I really love the steamed chicken; it's so digestible and really delicious.  It helps to have this cookbook because it isn't always easy to figure out how to convert a regular recipe to a pressure-cooked version. These recipes never fail. We got a T-Fal pressure cooker and really use it a lot. I even make desserts in it.	2001-02-22

While all the tumult of the sexual revolution, the Cold War, the Vietnam War seethed in the outside world, Karen was struggling with her difficult and almost medieval novitiate, her classes at Oxford, where her training as a nun conflicted with the scholastic world, and with her health. While Karen sought to cool the passions and desires of the world and become the perfect nun, her body rebelled and she suffered anorexia, fainting fits which were attributed to her emotions (but were diagnosed as epilepsy much later on.) Meanwhile, she achieved scholastic triumphs at Oxford, but at heavy price.<br />How Karen adjusts to live in the convent, and then to life at Oxford is an amazing story. Her autobiography is unsentimental and honest. This is a fascinating personal story as well as a rare look into a secret world that was forever altered by Vatican II and its reforms.	2001-02-22

However,when homesickness sets in and you want ribs, this book is a lifesaver. Let's face it, despite our reluctance to admit it, we all love some of the food from American chain restaurants (or why would they have proliferated across the country the way they have?)  And if you want to give an American-style dinner, this book is really fun to have.<br />In addition to the ribs (reason I got the book) there is a terrific cinnabon clone which is a great Sunday brunch item, as are the blinzes. This is not HAUTE Cuisine, but sure is fun.	2001-02-22

And during his heyday, we were getting back to nature, being hippies, reading the Foxfire books and re-acquainting ourselves with nature after the cosmic-rocket styles of the 50's.<br />This book is fun to read because of Euell's way of writing as if he were walking beside you in a field, pointing out the bounties of nature to you personally. His praise of the humble cat-tail, seen in any marsh or even in highway medians is nothing short of a miracle. I think he could survive on cat-tails alone for weeks.<br />Perhaps Euell felt so strongly about wild foods because as a teen during the Depression in the Texas dustbowl, he provided for the family during a particularly lean time, by gathering wild foods to supplement their diet of mostly pinto beans. He wandered many states later on in his life, finally settling in Camp Hill, PA with his wife Freda, but he never lost his love of wild foods and his feeling that, no one need be hungry if he is a friend of nature.<br />This book is especially poignant if you have read Into the Wild by Krakauer, the account of a young man who strikes off into the wilds of Alaska to test his mettle, and perishes from a fatal mistake in botany. I recommend all of Euell Gibbon's books, but especially this one, as it was written straight from his heart. After 30 years, it still never fails to enchant.	2001-02-21

Not your usual knitting book	Every knitting designer focuses on different techniques and style. Sasha Kagan and Kaffe Fassett are known for color work, Alice Starmore for Aran and Fairisle inspired design with an Scottish flair. Jean Moss' book is very interesting, in that it concentrates on texture and form, rather than color.<br />It is unusual to find knitting books with tailored, sculpted patterns. So this book stands out in that it has patterns that are a departure from the huge, shapeless bulkies of today's haute couture, or the classic jumpers that are featured in many other books.  If you love shape and texture in knitting, you will not be disappointed.<br />The best thing about this book is the use of Colinette yarns in some of the designs. These designer yarns are gorgeous, handpainted, textured, and matched for working together. It isn't always easy to visualize how to use them, and it's wonderful to have some patterns to show them at their best.	2001-02-21

Nobody but a character like Euell Gibbons could write such a downhome book that passed on folk wisdom and botany in a delightful way.<br />I actually prefer this book to &quot;Asparagus&quot; because it is a bit more useful. For example, if you live nearly anywhere in middle America, violet leaves pop up in your lawn and garden. They're readily available and easy to find. And he gives uses for cucumber-scented borage, which you can actually plant from seeds. This herb now is a top seller for its healthful oil-rich seeds that contain linoleic acid. If borage doesn't grow in your fields, you can put it in your herb garden. He gives great ideas for violets, borage, mint and other herbs either readily found or available to grow.<br />Careful however; some of the wild herbs look alike; most dangerously hemlock and parsley, angelica and other members of the carrot family look alike with their feathery fronds. Best to take a course in plant identification at the local community college if you are collecting these.	2001-02-21

I picked this one up on the recommendation of a friend, for a long plane ride.<br />Well, this book sure beats the inflight movie! In fact, I haven't seen the film made from it, but the book does read just like a film.<br />The plot is fairly simple; a jail break, and a fatal attraction between a cop and a suave criminal. This book is particularly fun to read in light of the recent jailbreak in Tennessee, where the criminals ended up on the lam for weeks.<br />These criminals are cut of a different cloth and the anti-hero is totally fictional; too intelligent and gentle to be real. But the characters are excellently drawn, the pace swift, and the book is diverting enough to keep you happy on any cramped flight. One of Elmore Leonard's better books, in my opinion and very enjoyable.	2001-02-21

It is, when well-made, surprisingly delicious. We served an excellent one to friends from Nova Scotia that we bought in Scotland, and our guests were delighted by its spicy richness.<br />Clarissa Disckon Wright, the witty co-host of the Two Fat Ladies cooking show, wrote this book with her wry humor but also with authority. It is an excellent work and fun to read. The illustrations are charming.<br />Be warned, however; making a haggis yourself is not for the faint-of-heart, nor is a detailed recipe included here--the initial stages of making haggis resemble a post-mortem more than a culinary exercise. Dickson Wright gently suggests you buy yours, as most people do. This is surprising, as she once described a recipe for beef tongue stuffed in sausage casing explaining, &quot;just as simple really as applying a condom, though, of course, less fun.&quot;	2001-02-21

A good intro to philosophy	I can tell you that this book is a lot more fun that sitting in a college or post-graduate philosophy class. I nearly choked on logical positivism in grad school, but this book makes Kant, Hegel and all the other greats of philosophy easy to absorb.<br />As a novel, I have some quibbles with the secondary theme; the mystery Sophie must solve seems a bit mean-spirited and manipulative to me. How she is treated by someone important in her life is, in my opinion, not how I would treat a child or anyone else, for that matter.  The entire tone is a bit teasing, like a superior college professor leading on a neophyte student. Not entirely good natured.<br />Still, this is an unusual book and very helpful for understanding a lot of western philosophy, which can be very DRY going at best. This creative book puts it in honeyed form, easy to take and smooth going down.	2001-02-21

Stranger in a Strange Land, Starship Troopers and Time Enough for Love are more familiar to readers than Tunnel in the Sky. But this novel of pioneering and coming-of-age is well worth reading.<br />Rod,who is a kind of &quot;everyman&quot; character, sets off for his final exam in a survival course. The students can take up to a certain weight of any equipment they want, from the latest model laser blaster, a German shepherd dog, and in one case, a saucepan and a deck of cards, and are dropped by star gate on an uninhabited planet. Objective; to survive until the pickup signal a few days later. But something goes terribly, terribly wrong. The pickup signal never happens and the band of survivors, from various schools' classes, must join and form a society for surviving the completely primitive planet.<br />How they band together and get over the natural personality frictions, use the little they have brought and how they survive all the unexpected challenges makes for exciting reading. The most appealing part of the book is that the protagonist Rod is NOT top dog, the big hero, but struggles along honestly and prevails.  This is a charming book and shows Heinlein at his best in handling some of the emotions of young men.	2001-02-20

Classic examples of marketing struggles such as the burger wars and cola wars are things we all can relate to, yet provide valuable examples of what to do and what NOT to do when marketing your products.<br />Reading these examples reminds you of what you already knew about marketing, yet probably forgot to use in your last marketing campaign. It never hurts to revisit these fundamentals--just as the great Larry Bird could be found practicing foul shots alone on the court many an evening.<br />Many people object to the military metaphor for business, but in this case, we're talking strategy and that's exactly what you need to employ to market products successfully. Basic principles such as knowing the leader's strength, finding the leader's weakness and hitting on a focused &quot;front&quot; are the offensive strategies. Defense (just as important to maintain market share) is discussed, as is &quot;guerrilla warfare&quot; or being the jeeps against the tanks.<br />&quot;Marketing Warfare&quot; is easy to read, enjoyable, understandable and applicable to anything you do in marketing. I consider it a MUST-HAVE for anyone doing business where a product is sold.	2001-02-20

We are introduced to Thorby as a scruffy young boy, being auctioned off as a slave on the planet Jubbelpore. He is so unpromising-looking that he ends up as the property of a one-legged resident of the Plaza and licensed mendicant (read, beggar) Baslim the Wise. Baslim drags Thorby home to his dwelling in the maze under the Plaze arena and thus begin the surprises in this very well-drawn novel.<br />Baslim feeds, then teaches the young boy, who is pig-ignorant, dirty and starving. He learns to read, then learns other surprising skills from Baslim the Wise, who is not only a beggar and wise man on the Plaza, but something more. Just how much more we don't find out til much later in the novel.<br />Thorby soaks up the rich lessons of the street and Baslim's teachings until one day he must flee for his life. He is assisted by the Free Traders, a society of space-faring traders who live on their ships and pay allegiance to no planet. This is a huge adjustment for Thorby--he must become a member of this insular group and follow their rigid customs and laws.  Thorby does adjust and is so well accepted he is about to be given (mostly without his knowledge) a bride, until....it's time for him again to move on.<br />Where Thorby does end up, and who he really is and how he finds out is the underlying story, but the real enjoyment is reading each distinct section of the book and savoring the different societies that Heinlein creates for us. This is rather like a sci-fi version of a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; --the genre of novel where a young man comes of age and finds himself, but in a really imaginative and touching way.	2001-02-20

So in addition to academic credentials, the author has lived the life he describes so well in this book.<br />While this is not a travelogue for those wishing a tour of Amish Country, it would be a very good thing to read before you go to Lancaster, PA or any of the other Amish-settled areas in the US and Canada. Dr. Hostetler describes attitudes to &quot;the English World&quot;, the religious and daily life, and how the Amish merge with their secular neighbors.<br />The book also describes a bit of the struggle the Amish faced in the 60's when they sought permission to have their own schools and end formal educatiion for their children at grade 8. While he says little about it, Hostetler's own life must have been affected by this attitude to what is required in education; he left the community to become a university professor, and subsequently lived with the Hutterites, another religious society in Canada and Europe.<br />This  is an enjoyable and  realistic book with no sentimentality or gloss. If you want to know more about the Amish, this is definitely the book to read.	2001-02-20

(Well, that was in the 60's, oof.)  I must say, this book holds up well against science fiction written far after it, and also after the technological surges of the 90's that made computers a household item and not just a device at work that spewed out yellow punchtape.<br />Heinlein attended Annapolis and was in the Navy; his experiences feed into many of his books (most famously, Starship Troopers.) And the theme of liberty, alternate marriage styles, animate computers also turn up in many of his works (Time Enough for Love.) Heinlein was kind of a libertarian; his ideas about society show up in many of his novels.<br />The endearing part of this book is the wonderful relationship between Mannie, jack-of-all-trades and computer technician, and Mike, the self-aware computer that runs everything on the Moon from the air systems and transport to accounting and telephones. The moon has been settled by various countries (Russia, US, China) and has been turned into a penal-colony and excess population dumping zone. The government is lead by the Warden, who views the post as a sinecure, and aside from keeping general order, does nothing. Since escape is pretty much impossible, the convicts and transportees have been left to set up a semi-anarchic society ruled mainly by common sense. (As long as you leave your neighbors in peace, they'll do the same for you.)<br />However, when Manny attends a Free Luna rally, he learns that the resources of the moon are being depleted and that without halting the one-way export of resources to the earth, the moon and its inhabitants will be soon be doomed to starvation. Manny joins an ad-hoc revolutionary cabal with his friend the Professor and blonde hot-head Wyoming Knott. Together with Mike the computer, who has an enviable insider view of everything that goes on and a puckish sense of humor, they found the Revolution with a novel cell structure depending on the savvy computer's abilities to remember everything and keep a secret.  Mike takes on the alter-ego as Adam Selene, the revolutionary leader (and bit of a stuffed-shirt) and the struggle begins. <br />How the Revolution is fought and won is an exciting tale. The end is bittersweet, as the moon must inevitably change and not everyone does survive the heroic struggle for freedom. This is a must-read science fiction book in my opinion, and one of Heinlein's best.	2001-02-20

I already had a copy of it at home, but this edition is so nicely done that I gave my old copy away and kept this one. The introduction of James Clavell is a nice touch.<br /><br />It is amazing to me that this book is not read in high schools or colleges in favor of Machiavelli's work (The Prince or The Art of War.) Sun Tzu's writing is clear and to the point. Unlike the popular Book of Five Rings by Musashi, this book is not metaphorical and poetic; it's downright practical. And it's not hard to read, unlike many classics.<br /><br />If you are doing business in China, this is also a good book to know. I mentioned some of the classic strategies while giving a course in China, and every member of the class had read it, knew it well, and gave me many examples from recent Chinese history where Sun Tzu's strategies were employed. This book is close to their hearts, and will give you insight if you are doing business in the East.<br />Of course, the most famous anecdote from this book is about gaining the obedience of troops; the emperor, wishing to interview Sun Tzu for the commission of general, asked if Sun Tzu's military principles could be applied to women. Sun Tzu replied yes, the principles worked for women as well as men. Accordingly, Sun Tzu was given the task of organizing the emperor's many concubines into an army. Sun Tzu lined up the concubines and set the two favorites as officers at the head of the columns.<br />He gave them a simple set of orders to march and drill (eyes front, right face, about face. The drums sounded and instead of following the commands, the girls simply giggled and blushed.<br /><br />He repeated the orders again, saying that if the orders were not clear, it is first the fault of the general. He repeated the commands, and the girls simply stood and giggled again.<br /><br /> \\"If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.\\"  Upon saying this, he ordered the two concubines at the head of the troop, favorites of the emperor, to be beheaded.<br /><br />The emperor hurriedly sent down the command to stop, he had no desire to see his favorites executed. The emperor said \\"We are satisfied that the general knows how to command.\\"<br /><br />But Sun Tzu said, \\"Once having received the commission, there are certain commands I am unable to accept.\\" And he ordered the two favorites to be beheaded. Once again, he gave the commands. The concubines marched, whirled about and drilled in perfect order.  The emperor appointed Sun Tzu general.hly understood, the general is to blame.

What Asimov lacks in character development, he makes up for in excellent plots with good surprises throughout. \\"The Gods Themselves\\" is an interesting book--it's later Asimov and it's not a robot novel nor a Foundation novel. It deals with a major discovery, the \\"electron pump\\" which looks to be a source of unlimited, free energy, and two groups of scientists in parallel universes who each have an agenda that threatens to obscure a dangerous truth.<br /><br />In this novel, Asimov creates a totally believable alien race, complete with three sexes (and he deftly handles their mating or lovemaking with amazing sensitivity and creativity.) A bridge between the alien universe and ours offers something for each side, seemingly for free, but scientists on both sides begin to sense that something is evilly wrong. How the wrong is righted is quite surprising and touching. The alien adolescents Odeen, Dua and Tritt are fascinating together. Dua shines as a conflicted, troubled and unusually intelligent person who turns out to be quite the heroine. (Incidentally the names are sorta-kinda \\"one\\", \\"two\\" and \\"three\\" in Russian)<br /><br />The third part of the novel is the weakest (where the people on the Moon figure out what's happening with the Proton Pump.) It has the worst of Asimov's attempts to write romance. And the first section can be a bit slow unless you have worked in academia, in which case, his characterization of professors and their internal wars is spot-on (you wonder, what was life like when Asimov was a professor at Boston University. Probably pretty acrimonious at some point.)<br /><br />I rate this one of my favorite novels of Asimov, along with The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun--leaving aside the Foundation books, which stand on their own as an achievement in a series form. Asimov deftly creates alternative worlds, and if his characters are sometimes a bit wooden, it's overshadowed by his amazing imagination. This novel may actually be his best, if not his most creative.  I'm not knocking off any stars for the saggy end portion, because the middle of the book in the alternate universe, and the plot is so good.<br /><br />The new audiobook narrated by Scott Brick is excellent.

Then in the early 90's they decided to go &quot;all-sewing, all the time&quot; and not publish articles on knitting. Meanwhile, they had a large collection of very excellent articles written with their signature hand drawn illustrations. Fortunately, Taunton Press, publisher of Threads has seen fit to reprint these articles in several books.<br />This book has the article on bead knitting, which has been responsible for getting MANY people addicted to this unusual form of knitting (and a vintage art, at that.) The article on fitting larger people is a classic, and relies on the Threads know-how on fitting. Some of the fashions now look a bit 80's, but even so, this is an excellent reference and well worth adding to the knitting library.	2001-02-16

Many of the other patterns are available in other forms or in improved forms in newer books (ie Faroese, Pi) But if you longed to have this issue and can't find it, this is really a good reference book to have.

The Taj is indeed magnificent; it's a long car ride out of New Delhi but worth the visit. However, near Agra are other sites listed in this book that are just as amazing, and worth visiting because they will round out your view of the history of the area. (Did you know a black marble version of the Taj was designed by the same Shah Jahan, to be built as his own tomb nearby? And that his son imprisoned him in the nearby Red Fort, with a view of the Taj from his luxurious cell?)<br />Actually, in Delhi we were even more impressed by the Qutb Minar, which despite its being called a minaret (Islamic Prayer Tower) was really an astronomical observatory. If you are lucky and get a highly educated guide (ours was a retired university professor who volunteers there) you will find out the interesting background behind the tower, the Hindu design of the temple, the mysterious iron pillar and more. But don't rely on getting a good guide; we were lucky. Better to have this book to make sure you know what you are going to see.<br />India has a fabulous wealth of World Heritage sites and some of the most impressive architecture and archeology in the world. If you get a chance to go to India, you should get this book to make sure you can visit some of these wonders.

It's hard to classify the tips and secrets in here; this is mainly a compilation of good knitting information that just doesn't fit into a single subject. For example, there is a pattern for a baby bootie that doesn't slip. I must have made dozens of these and every time the grateful parent comes back and says &quot;Wow! Those were the only baby socks that didn't fly off Junior's feet when he kicked.&quot;<br />There's plenty of information on finishing, always a sore subject. These tips were gathered by Taunton Press, the publishers of Threads Magazine. Threads used to print articles about knitting, but in the mid-90's they switched the magazine to a (very excellent) all-sewing format. They preserved their knitting articles and these tips in a series of books on knitting, which was a great idea. These knitting articles were each unique and very useful.<br />I have several of the Taunton books, but by far this is the one I use the most.

Because not only are these hats cute and flattering on nearly anybody, but they are terrific projects on which to learn color knitting technique. This book teaches you to make the traditional Fair Isle tam and has some lovely, flower-like patterns to knit. It's fun just to look at this book, but even more fun to make the hats. The moment you take the hat off the dinner plate where you are blocking it into a flat, circular shape, and put it on your head is one you won't want to miss as a knitter.<br />Tams are knit circularly, and use both circular needles and double point needles. A series of decreases shapes the hat. They use traditional Fair Isle patterns like OXO's or peeries (small designs of short repeating patterns.)  If you choose one of the many delightful shades of Shetland yarn available in 3 oz skeins, you can make a minor masterpiece of shading, color and pattern.<br />If you intend to embark on a fair isle sweater, or just love the look of Fair Isle but want a quicker project, this book is just invaluable.	2001-02-14

Mittens play an important part in courtship and marriage rituals in Latvian culture. The patterns are rich and decorative, with edgings of fringe or scallops and small patterns reminiscent of Fair Isle knitting.<br />Even though you probably won't want to make as many mittens as a Latvian bride should need for her dowry, you will be inspired by the variety. The patterns, colorways and edgings are quite useful for adapting to other knitting designs like sweaters, hats and vests.<br />All my grandparents came from Latvia, and I wish they'd been able to bring some of these wonderful folk handworks with them when they came to America. I would have loved to have seen some from the old country. The author has done a great job in documenting the patterns and the lore behind them.	2001-02-14

Ok, so chances are, you aren't going to be able to paint like John Singer Sargent just by reading this book. However, it is really interesting to read about Sargent's techniques and see the author do a painting in the style of Sergent.<br /><br />Turner, Cotman, and other masters of the watercolor medium are demonstrated as well. This is a beautifully printed book with lots in it for anyone who loves watercolors. You can develop your own technique by studying the masters; this is a time-honored tradition (you can still see people today in the Louvre, copying the works of the masters as an art exercise.)<br /><br />This is one of my favorite watercolor books. It's enjoyable just to read and look at the way the author tries to replicate an artist's method of painting, and the examples give you ideas of subjects you can try yourself (for example, a cherry tree by a barn, your kids at the beach, your garden.)	2001-02-14

It's a really good reference and instructional book on how to do gum bichromate printing for black and white negatives.<br />Normal photographic printing is done on silver bromide paper; the photosensitive silver crystals make the black of the print. In gum bichromate printing, chromate is used in a gum emulsion mixed with colored pigments to harden under light exposure. (I'm trying to stay away from the chemistry here.) After making a negative to use for contact printing, the negative and coated paper are exposed to light. Where light penetrates your negative, the gum-chromate-pigment mixture hardens and stays on the paper. Where not exposed to light, the solution washes away.<br />This isn't an easy technique, but is a very lovely one, and even more interesting when mixed with other techniques like cyanotype. It's also possible now to use laser printer to produce some of the contact negatives you need.<br />The only caveat I must add is that chromium compounds are TOXIC. So if you are not experienced at handling chemicals, this technique is NOT for you and your home darkroom. However, if you have experience in good lab technique and know your way around a darkroom, this is a very alluring technique to make some wonderfully, almost hand-colored looking prints. This fits in especially well with the current interest people have in handmade books and journals.	2001-02-14

The answer is well explained in this book. By the time you built such a car, it might be so heavy it couldn't move!<br />The real interest in this book are the analyses of various disasters that should have been planned for, but weren't.<br />The most terrible engineering disaster (and the reason I bought this book) was the collapse of the sky walkway in a hotel in Kansas City in the 1980's. I was just returning from KC when I heard the horrific news on the radio. The skyway collapsed during a dance, killing hundreds and injuring more in a dreadful disaster. I was very upset by this terrible event. Why did this happen?<br />The explanation in &quot;To Engineer Is Human&quot; is really brilliant; the walkway was designed &quot;properly&quot; with a bolt that went through the beam supporting it. But it could not be built as designed because the bolt couldn't be installed in the vertical support. Instead, the builders split the vertical support into two parts in order to install two bolts, and each part was then able to move independently, causing a shear force that eventually led to the disaster. A brilliant analysis and one that showed that despite correct design, the plan must be able to be implemented to work--or else the execution of the plan may doomed to disastrous failure.<br />That lesson is really important when you are engineering anything, even software. You may specify an important feature, but if the R&amp;D department cannot implement the plan, the product may fail to meet its goals, even be defective.<br />The book is a bit &quot;thin&quot;--I wanted more and wished it were longer and had more detail, but I will say it makes its point and memorably so. After reading it, your eyes will be opened to how things are designed, how things fail and how engineering affects our lives.	2001-02-14

A must-read	Although science is not everyone's favorite subject, the story of the sequencing of the human genome is of importance to every person on the planet.<br />The story of the Human Genome Project itself, which is an illustration of how the private sector can succeed where government funded projects have difficulties, is interesting in itself. Even outside of the medical and ethical implications, this story is worth reading for that information alone.<br />But where this book really provides important food for thought is in the medical and ethical arena. It is now possible to find the location and coding for diseases and potential diseases using this information. How will we use this information? To create cures for devastating degenerative diseases like Huntington's, to find cures for the incurable? Or will we use it to deny medical care to people deemed potential insurance risks.<br />One thing that came out of the study was the surprising small number of genes that comprise the genome--one third the number that had long been predicted. Clearly, the genome is an instruction set, and the blueprints to build a human, and the errors that create disease, are written in how the genes are interpreted by the biological mechanism.<br />How we should utilize this information, for good or evil, in years to come will surely be some of the most controversial and important discussions we will have. This book is an excellent place to start in order to understand the basis of this world-shaking achievement.	2001-02-13

I have two or three baby sweaters I love to make as gifts, and I customize them with appliques, and other ideas from Nicky Epstein's wonderful embellishments.<br /><br />For example, I made the Cottage Creations Babies and Bears Sweater yet again, this time in a beige wool, and put an applique faux pocket with embroidered initials on it, a contrast red and loden edging and I had a lovely Bavarian style sweater for a co-worker's new son.<br /><br />I also adore the section on what to do with I-cord. If your kids like to knit this by the yard, here's ideas to use the cord. For example, you can make stunning Celtic-style knotwork by applying the cord to a plain knitted ground on a pillow or afghan, or even the pockets or front of a plain pullover. (If you are just learning to knit and doing plain raglan sweaters, and can do I-cord, you can make some things that will make you look as if you are a master knitter.)<br /><br />This book is also fun just to browse.

Nanda Devi is indeed the story of a Himalayan mountaineering expedition that resulted in death and injury, but it is more a story of how people lead and follow each other, in this case, in a life-and-death situation. Business management is not life-and-death, but the same frictions, malfunctions and mistakes apply to everyday life. So this book is not only fascinating for climbing and exploration history, it is valuable for a study of human nature. It's a valuable study for anyone interested in the art of leadership.<br />Willi Unsoeld, an experienced mountain climber who had successfully conquered Everest, started this expedition along with his daughter Nanda Devi. Unsoeld had named his infant daughter for the most beautiful mountain he'd ever seen. Naturally, as a young climber and daughter of a prominent mountaineer, she was determined to climb her namesake.<br />Right from the start, the co-leaders of the expedition disagreed fundamentally on everything from climbing style to food. Neither leader would take control, preferring instead to let members of the group make their own decisions and run a &quot;mellow climb.&quot; The climb itself took place at a less-than-optimal time of year to accommodate one of the leaders, who had to wait for the end of the school year. The lack of strong, executive leadership split the entire expedition team into factions. Even simple decisions on evacuating members with altitude sickness became muddled and nearly ended in tragedy. This set the tone for the rest of the climb, and only the climbers who struck out for themselves or were extremely rugged ended up making it to the summit. Other members failed to summit or, in the case of Nanda Devi herself, lost her life on the mountain for which she was named.<br />The Roskelly version of the expedition in this book caused lasting rifts in the climbing world. John Roskelly, the author of this book, was one of the climbers who did successfully reach the summit. There was lingering bitterness long after the expedition and the publication of the book. Everyone involved had their own version of what went wrong and who was to blame.<br />Not only is this an exciting and well-told tale of an expedition, but the book highlights the behaviors that lead to the tragedy. While this book is one man's opinion of what happened, it is a good look into what can go deathly wrong when leadership is mishandled.<br />Other good books to read with a similar theme are Roland Huntford's Last Place on Earth, which contrasts the leadership styles of Scott and Amundsen in the race to the South Pole, and Krakauer's Into Thin Air, the story of another tragic Himalayan climb.ok, was one of the climbers who did successfully reach the summit.

Marina Vaizey is well qualified as an editor to co-author a book with Christo; she's a much-published art editor.<br />Christo's work struck me at first as just plain nuts. Wrap a bridge in cloth? Surround an island with pink, floating plastic? Run a fence for miles? Stack oil drums into a mountain? Then I saw the photos of the Key Biscayne islands, each emerald drop surrounded by a flamingo pink halo and I got it. This is art on a monumental scale. And the temporary nature of it makes it even more special; to see these works most people must rely on photos or sketches of the proposed concept by Christo; the actual work of art only exists for a short period of time and of course by nature, cannot travel to exhibitions. How I wish I could have flown over the Keys to see their complete transformation by this incredible artist.  Once you study the photos and drawings in this book, you'll have a great idea of Christo's unique genius and the role of his partner Jeanne-Claude (who only recently began to gain credit for her part in his work.)<br />There aren't enough books on Christo, so this is an important work.

Read this book	This is one of the most useful books for someone who is facing redeployment,downsizing, being laid off or whatever the current euphemism is these days for losing your job. It's also handy for finding a new job for yourself when you are dissatisfied with your current situation.<br />The book title says it all: today, you MUST view yourself as self-employed to control your career path. No one will do that for you. The heady days of the Dot-Coms and IT boom, when headhunters stopped taking corporate clients and couldn't find enough people to fill positions have evaporated almost overnight. Now those courted employees are being laid off and must once again, pound the pavement. Don't suffer a rude awakening. After the period when you feel anger and loss (understandable) you need to take control and steer your own career. This book is absolutely invaluable to help you do that, and to get over the nasty shock of loss, betrayal, feeling of failure, whatever you are experiencing from a temporary lull in your personal path.<br />This is not a how-to book. It's about changing your attitude and habits permanently to protect yourself in the corporate world, no matter what the climate.<br />Don't forget to re-read it from time to time, to remind yourself of what you need to do to stay on course. This is one of the best books on the subject and I think far, far more than &quot;What Color is your Parachute.&quot;	2001-02-12

Without this association to Lennon, she'd probably be relegated to the rarified world of conceptual art and never be a household name. But the fame came at a high price; she was villified for her influence on the pop-cult Beatles and blamed for their demise. This is unfair; the Beatles would have evolved and changed without any help from Yoko Ono or Linda Eastman McCartney. And then she suffered the cruelest blow of all, to have her husband murdered by a crazed fan.<br /><br />I became a fan of her art in the 60's when I read about some of her \\"performance\\" art; one favorite; she dressed herself in her best dress,gave scissors to members of an audience, sat down in a chair and encouraged them to take snips out of her dress. At first, people were shy to do so, then as one or another became bolder and snipped bits from the dress, the group became practically frenzied and she felt even worried they would go farther than just snipping a dress with the shears. A wonderful elucidation of human behavior and original; it gave new insight into ourselves and thus was truly a work of art. Other works that impressed me were photos of the bottoms of bare feet, from under a glass surface, and of course the film of buttocks, which I personally never did have a chance to see, but loved the idea of.<br /><br />This book is a tremendous resource of information into Yoko Ono's varied art including her music. (No reason why a CD can't be part of a book, great idea.) This book is a fine retrospective, and I only regret that Yoko Ono will never fully take her place in modern art because of the diluting influence of pop culture on her history, and because conceptual art still has not been given the same validity as other media.

Honestly, I have to admit, the first page I ever published was with an older version of HotMetal Pro (4.0) and I had no trouble at all using it. Then I switched to FrontPage (Microsoft) and found it a lot easier to use. HOWEVER, FrontPage can be a bit quirky with Microsoft's proprietary tags and some features only with its proprietary server extensions.  But SoftQuad hasn't exactly had a great track record with HotMetal Pro either (many service packs--service pack is a euphemism for a PATCH.)<br />HoTMetaL is not for people who want to create Web pages without learning HTML.  Actually, you won't find an HTML web page publisher that lets you get away with that. Due to the very nature of HTML (you are writing code that can be displayed on anyone's computer with ANY browser) you must understand the basics of HTML, annoying though it is. Many people swear by the HotMetal Pro product, because of the relatively trouble-free publishing. I guess to sum it up, it's easier to get started with FrontPage, but easier to finish up with HotMetal Pro because debugging is a bit easier. This does NOT apply to HotMetal Pro's CSS or DHTML. You still have to load to an external browser to preview these features, kind of a nuisance. And I can't say I love the WYSIWYG interface. I like FrontPage's WYSIWYG interface a lot more BUT...HotMetal Pro writes very good, clean, functional HTML code and that's worth a lot.<br />Software bundled with HotMetal Pro includes WS_FTP PRO 6.0, a good FTP client, and Ulead stuff, including PhotoImpact SE. These tools are nowhere near as nice as Adobe Photoshop and ImageReady, but then again they are free and not the bux that Adobe commands for their topnotch products.  For basic graphic design for the Web, these tools are adequate. I don't like Ulead much, but it works, and the GIF animator is good.<br />In summary, this is a popular choice as a web authoring software and will probably write cleaner code than (whisper it) FrontPage. So it's a good software to learn to use. Would I use it over FrontPage? You know, much as I like FrontPage, I just may switch.to learn to use. Would I use it over FrontPage?

How handy to have a lavishly illustrated book, organized from A to Z, to list all those techniques you need to look up,from various kinds of decreases and increases to cords, duplicate stitch, making up, more. It's beautifully photographed.<br /><br />Even though I'm an experienced knitter who has even knitted for a commercial designer in the past, I still have to look up certain increase techniques from time to time. I love the A-Z format. You don't have to depend on the vagaries of an index to quickly find what you need to know. The idea of including an inspirational gallery makes this book perennially useful, as you can read it for pleasure and to get design ideas and not just for reference. I used to list several books that, when added together, had all the elements this book has. Now I have a single source reference book I can recommend enthusiastically.	2001-02-12

This is the story of the medieval (in every sense of the word) Il Palio race around the walled town of Siena, Italy. Horse clubs (contrade) from the 17 wards of the city gather to form alliances against others, horses and jockeys evaluated and selected and a very strenuous and difficult race around the town plaza is portrayed. I can still remember the scene, banners of the contradas flying, their symbols (the Wave, the Snail) and the subterfuge and plotting to win this race, which lasts only a minute or two. Not only accurate, but a dramatic tale of a young jockey. Brilliant. I hope it is someday reprinted.	2001-02-10

It means that you can have the enjoyment of sharing the whimsical story about the quirky Rosie and the miraculous drawings of Maurice Sendak.<br />This isn't a saccharine kiddy book, or a gritty true-to-life drama of childhood situations. It's just a fine read and one of those books that kids ask for again and again. In our family, it was the favorite evening book of my baby sister, and I have to say, she has exquisite taste, then and now, 30 years later.	2001-02-10

First off, let me tell you that if you are updating your old PC and have bought a new one with Windows ME, or have updated your old PC with the new operating system, you need this book.<br />Windows ME is the home operating system (as opposed to Windows 2000 which is more business and network oriented.) It's sufficiently different from Windows 98 that you can get a lot of benefit by using a guidebook such as this. The online help and tutorials that come with Windows ME are just not enought.<br />The first part of the book deals with moving around the operating system at the basic level. While most things will look familiar to you, the browser-like Explorer is vastly improved. The first section of the book explains how you can have customized views for your pictures and graphics, helpful for the home digital photographer. After reading this section, you will be able to optimize your Explorer to suit the types of files you keep on the PC.<br />Realize that some of the power of Windows ME is that it was designed to improve how you interface with the internet. However, networking was totally redone in Windows ME and greatly improved. You'd be surprised how many people are using home networks, so this is an important development. There is an excellent section in this book dealing with networks, and this is probably worth buying the book alone for this information, if you intend to do any networking with Windows ME.<br />Windows ME is also designed for multimedia and there is plenty in here for learning how Windows ME is used with various peripherals. And lastly, internet access is another focus of the improved functions in Window ME, and there are topics to deal with the many changes that have been made to the operating system.	2001-02-08

I resisted buying this book at first, even though I admire Anna Zilboorg's work a lot. (see her books Fine and Fanciful Hats, Fancy Feet and Socks for Clogs and Sandals to see more of her creative, colorful designs.)  BUT...was I ever pleased with this book when I got it.<br />Turns out the value is not just for the mittens, which are in every sense magnificent, but also for the techniques she uses to embellish the cuffs, and for the color patterns and colorways.<br />The mittens themselves have HUGE deep gauntlet cuffs that make them suitable wear for dress coats. Could be good with a cape for dramatic evening wear if you are going out somewhere COLD. The cuffs are further enriched with fringe, embroidery, duplicate stitch, and other edgings. A method is given for lining the mittens with angora if you choose, to make them extremely comfortable and very warm to wear.<br />The patterns are based on Turkish color knitting, eye-teasing repeating patterns that are quite different than Fairisle or Norwegian knitting. These are related to Islamic art, where repeating, interlocking geometrics are used since Islamic art forbids the representation of anything from nature.  The colors are rich and exciting. In addition to the color and embellishment, Anna Zilboorg provides several ways of attaching the mitten thumb (on the palm or side &quot;sore thumb sticking out&quot; methods.)<br />BUT...even if you don't want to knit a single mitten, the techniques for fringe and edgings, plus the color patterns are useful for pillows, sweaters, hats, socks, and more. Either way, this book is a visual treat (wonderfully photographed and printed by XRX press) and a treasure to own for any knitter.	2001-02-08

Joyce Vedral is a very accomplished writer and also experienced in weight training (she is an English professor at Pace University) So she can write, and she knows about her subject.<br />Faced with a physique that tended to put on weight, Vedral took up weight training, fell in love with it, and has written quite a few books on the subject. Here she has done an excellent job of figuring out a weight program that can be done anywhere, by nearly anyone, with simple equipment, no gym and just a bit of time.<br />While this won't whittle your abs down to a washboard or create monster pecs, this workout will keep you fit when you are on the go. If you are stuck in hotel rooms with no fitness centers (most of the world) or at home with kids (rest of the world) you can do this with a simple set of dumbells and a chair and telephone book. (You can even get water-fillable, collapsible dumbells to take up no weight in your suitcase.)<br />The routine does work the entire body and while not as good as a full workout in the gym with free weights, treadmill and Nautilus, and won't bulk you up, it is a good fitness routine to keep you ever in shape, in a minimum of time. It is NOT easy (you will be pleasantly tired afterwards) but it is effective.	2001-02-08

My first impression of this newest Splash was &quot;Wow!&quot; I was impressed by the sheer gamut of paintings from super-realistic to abstract. I found the abstract selections particularly appealing and useful.<br />But at second glance, I was not convinced this would help my painting enough to justify keeping the book. I think I got more out of Jeanne Carbonetti's books (Tao, Zen, Yoga of ...series) and of Watercolor Bold and Free.<br />So, if you want a good selection of examples of art focusing on the use of texture, this is a good selection. If you have a wide library of watercolor books already, this may not be anything really that new.	2001-02-07

Here's a book with just the same idea, wonderfully done.<br />There are a bunch of other very useful patterns, too. The throw featured on the cover of the book (called &quot;Tribal&quot;) is gorgeous as designed, but this is also a great pattern to adapt with your own mixes of novelty yarns. The great thing about pillows and throws is that the gauge and size need not follow the pattern; it should just look pleasing and you can then knit it to any size you want.<br />Many knitters like to collect interesting yarns of various textures, with eyelashs and shimmering strands. You can use this same pattern adapted to mix in some of these yarns you collect in your &quot;stash&quot; and create an original design. In fact, the matching pillow is a good place to practice with some of your stash yarns to see how they'd look.<br />So for &quot;stash-busting&quot; (using up stores of yarn in your closet) or for creating some elegant designs following the patterns, this book has a lot to offer.	2001-02-06

Some of the projects here have been published elsewhere (the Zodiac throw was I think in a series of issues of Knitters.) As to weirder things like knitted ornamental fruit (?) and lampshades, I suppose they have a place in shabby chic, or even could be interesting knit in chenille. Knitted lampshades are not unusual in Germany; a common home item is a hanging shade on an octagonal wire frame, knit of lace in nice natural colors. Kinda cute.<br />However, I prefer Nicky Epstein's Knitted Embellishments book as a reference; lots of useful techniques with I cord to make Celtic Knotwork on afghans and pillows, fringes and tassels. You might also look at Erica Knight's Home Decor knitting book or Judith Shangold's Design Source Book of Home Decor, with an Amish inspired throw.<br />If you want some stunning intarsia throws, this is a great book to have. Otherwise, for knitting items for the home, I think you'd be better off with the other books mentioned here.	2001-02-06

The effect is far from simple; it's that stripped-down-to-the-essentials that makes watercolors so appealing yet difficult to learn. One or more strokes of the brush, and you've gone too far and the painting is overworked and wrong. This book will help you over that perenniel problem.<br />Mr. Cranshaw's book is full of examples on which you can learn, copy and base your own outdoor and studio painting. His sense of fun is never far away. I have other books from this author and I did some really great paintings of cattle immediately and easily after reading and trying his methods. If you want to simplify and improve your watercolor, get some good techniques for plein-air (outdoors) work, I can't recommend this book enough.	2001-02-05

(Is it a complete guide for idiots, or a guide for complete idiots?) And how can you be an idiot or dummy if you are bound and determined to learn something and willing to spend your good money doing it? Sounds smart to me. Nevertheless....<br />This book is very very useful. Photoshop is difficult! The more powerful the software, the more difficult to use. And some of the more arcane features of the software are important to get to know, like managing color (especially useful if you do web publishing or digital photography.) This part of the book is worth the price alone.<br />All in all, you can't go wrong if you want to learn Photoshop. If you don't mind the silly Idiot title (isn't this getting a bit old by now?) you'll have a highly useful resource to get started doing some great things.	2001-02-05

Make one of these blankets	I knit a lot of sweaters for BOF's (babies of friends) but the little tykes grow out of them in an instant. A baby blanket is a great project because it can grow with the baby. When Junior is ambulatory, he can tote it around like Linus and drag it behind him in the dust until the ridicule of his elder siblings or friends makes him finally give it up.<br />The patterns here are varied, and have different levels of difficulty. None are too tiring, because a baby blanket is just so much fun--you won't get afghan-itis and peter out because they are pretty small. And you can use fun colors you wouldn't dress a baby in. So have fun, and make one of these.	2001-02-04

The wool was carefully chosen, the designs modern and timeless, with that ineffable Scandanavian flair. Sadly the Bohus workshop has long been closed. All that remains are some treasured vintage sweaters and...this book to document their history. And not only does this book document the history of Bohus Workshop, it also has patterns so you can make some of the famous designs yourself.<br />This isn't knitting for the timid; many of the designs boldly go where color knitting isn't supposed to go; there are patterns with 3, 4 even more colors per row. The colors are subtle and varied, knitted in an angora/wool mix to create the &quot;shimmering&quot; effect the Bohus designs were famous for.  But if you embark on such a knitting adventure you will surely make a masterpiece you will wear or give with great pride.<br />A source for the kind of yarn that closely matches the Bohus mix is provided in the book, plus patterns for the famous fairisle-like yoke pattern models. Also included are jackets with matching designs to the yoke pullovers, mittens, and hats. You can certainly adapt the design to your own creations. Not all the designs require many colors per row; some are two color only throughout and some rely more on texture than color.<br />This book is worth reading for textile history, for history of women in clothing design, and for knitting history. And it's also a valuable knitting reference for people who like to knit their own designs as well as reproduce them from patterns. All in all, this book has a lot and is one of my great favorites.	2001-02-04

My first knitting book when I was a kid in the 60's was a 1948 book called &quot;Modern Knitting&quot; that featured comically out-of-date jumpers and weird weird hats. (A knitted fez. A knitted Robin Hood forage cap. Yes, really.)<br />But everything old is new again...and knitting is enjoying a rebirth. Oh boy, that's good news. So is this book.<br />It is very hard to find kid's sized ordinary patterns and useful baby things, plus men's work knits like mittens, gloves, scarves. I used to use my old vintage book a lot for these things because the patterns for new knits just didn't have what I wanted. So I am really glad this book was published with so many vintage patterns in a nice new binding. (my antique ones are crumbling!)<br />If you do historical recreations or theater, this book will also be of tremendous value.	2001-02-04

No indeed, though you'd be lucky to own such a heirloom and be even more lucky to decide to make one.<br />You can use these squares and edgings for so much more. For example, the squares can be made into frons of sweaters and tunics for very original textured effects. Of course they also make good afghans from thicker wool. Or pillows. You choose, there are so many options.<br />I like looking at the squares just for the inventiveness and incredible variety.

Kaffee Fassett is fascinated by overstuffed patterns and the huge flora of the Victorian age, plus the visual excitement of clutter and bric-a-brac. He has been able to translate his art into some very Victorian kittens, complete with sweet expressions and sugary pink bow. This design even makes my manly (but cat-loving) husband melt.	2001-02-02

The color photography is great, however. If you get used to the charts, however, the color pictures are great and stitch dictionaries like this stimulate your creative juices. I love charts, but I am so used to the standardized symbols that I find I'm a bit slowed down when I have to learn new ones.<br /><br />For that reason, I prefer the Barbara Walker series on knitting stitches, but for creative stimulation, the Harmony series is wonderful. The sheer number of stitches that can be made just boggles the imagination.<br /><br />I would say, I recommend this book because 250 stitches are a LOT, there are color photos and if you design your own knitting, you just can't have too many stitch dictionaries.	2001-02-02

What is better than a gorgeous afghan in colors you choose to suit your special friend? And afghans don't have to fit anyone. They are also valuable for using up stashes of yarn and for donating to shelters (check first to see your local shelter wants this kind of donation and if they want washable types of yarn.)	2001-02-02

Kaffe Fassett, a London-based artist, discovered that he could use a rainbow pallette of yarn as well as paint to express his particular artistic ideas. The rest is knitting history.<br />Kaffe also pioneered a new type of &quot;less technique, more design&quot; knitting. He uses cut strands of yarns to create wonderful repeating patterns of circles, tumbling blocks and multicolored stripes. The ends are woven in as he goes along --or not. Finishing on the back is not so important; getting a wonderful colorway and exciting visual pattern is the objective.<br />Likewise, the shape and structure of the garment is not the focus although I really like the swing of the long coat and the shape of the peplum-styled jacket. But Kaffee Fassett is first and formost a colorist and painter, not a designer of couture. So the patterns are better for inspiration and finding your own path than for being followed with the exact yarn and exact pattern. But these patterns can be made successfully, and most people who've made them report that it has been an exciting adventure.<br />In summary, I'd recommend this book if you like to design your own knitted garments, if you want color and pattern inspiration and new ideas, and if you just like to read gorgeous books. If you want couture and shaping, or knitting instruction this is not the best book on knitted garments.	2001-02-02

Many commercial patterns use yarns that are not available in every part of the world, or may be a bit expensive. Learning how to substitute yarn successfully expands your knitting options and allows you to make a special knitted masterpiece all your own (and maybe at a budget price, too.)<br />I can't recommend this book enough to people who want to extend their knitting skills. It's really great.	2001-02-02

Winston does deal with time robbers and emergencies--which are some of those uncontrollable things, and give good hints for organizing your day.<br />I think it is a bit ambitious to include job changing in such a book , but since this is a task that you must make time for and that many people find hard to schedule because of inertia or unwillingness or the unpleasantness of getting going on a job search, I suppose it is just as well that this topic is covered.  But for job hunting, you'd probably need a more specific book.	2001-02-01

Maybe you are like me and the one thing you DON'T want to face when you come home from the office is a pile of raw ingredients that somehow has to get converted into an edible state in less than 40 minutes. Not fun. Better to start your dinner in the slow cooker before you go to work and come home to the appetizing aroma of a nicely cooked meal.<br />Slow cookers aren't expensive(I got mine for less than $10 and they turn up at yard sales.) The electricity consumption is very low, something like a 60 watt light bulb. So what's not to like? Well, slow cooking isn't the same technique as cooking a stew or roast on the stove. If you don't know how to adjust a recipe, you will often get a raw or a watery mess. And you DO need hints on how to use the cooker (such as, don't keep lifting the lid, you'll dissipate the heat and your cooking times will be off.)<br />This book is full of the important basics of slow cooking you need to know, plus full of recipes. I like it a lot better than Mabel Hoffmann's very widely published book on slow cooking because it has a larger format --I don't like small format paperback cookbooks because they don't stay open on the kitchen counter. This is a great addition to any kitchen library and the recipes are adaptable enough that you can adjust them and create your own.	2001-02-01

His soup can and Marilyn Monroe took common icons and created pop icons instantly. This was one of the 20th Century's most brilliant comments on &quot;us&quot; and the world of art. The conflict between the rarified world of fine art and popular art is really fascinating, and this book hits the mark.<br />King of Kitsch Hemmingway does a great job here of describing various popular artworks and why they've made the transition from &quot;bad&quot; to &quot;beloved.&quot;  A fun book, and a great concept, complete with peel-off art for your very own.	2001-01-31

And I happen to know this book is the &quot;favorite child&quot; of this much-published author.  I read it with just as much, if not more pleasure than Anguished English and Get Thee to a Punnery, some of Richard's more famous works. Don't expect the usual mad romp through the English language; this book is more literary than light literature.<br />If you want to improve your writing, you will profit by reading the chapter on the beauty of using short words. The examples of student writings that employ only single syllable words are dazzling.<br />If you teach English, you might enjoy using some of the student writing examples in your classes to inspire your own students. In fact if you are an English teacher or just a lover of the English language, I don't see how you can be without this book. It is a treasure.	2001-01-29

A visual treat, inspiring and helpful	If you love watercolor (just to look or also to paint them) you may possibly adore this book as much as I do.<br />Lucy Willis is immensely talented. Her feeling for light and how to handle it with watercolor is nothing short of amazing. She does many of the paintings in this book &quot;a la prima&quot; or without pencil drawing first. This fact alone astonished me as her rendering is draftsman-accurate with a brush.  She also has a nice section on painting interior scenes. I hope she writes another book, so I can see more of her delightful work.	2001-01-29

Interesting!)<br /><br />I use this book as a guide, making my own color charts based on the mixes in the book.<br /><br />The section on mixing flesh tones is especially helpful.

Orenburg shawls look a lot like Shetland cobweb lace shawls (but which came first? Orenburg shawls are mentioned in writing at least back to the beginning of the 18th Century.) The technique starts with an edging, then corners are turned and the body of the lace shawl is knitted together with the side edging.<br />The best part of this book is the history and story of the life of the Orenburg knitters, who even today support their families by knitting gorgeous works of art out of handspun silky mohair yarn. This book is a must if you are a lace knitter.	2001-01-28

A complete, comprehensive test of colors from a wide range of major manufacturers of watercolor, this book lists the lightfastness and handling characteristics of each color. But that's not all. You get reflectance curves, mixing potential, transparency, lifting, staining, granularity and other properties of pigments. (But it is fun to read, as the information is presented in a very accessible form)<br />Never buy a horrid tube of chalky, weak, miscolored, fugitive paint again.

This isn't a pattern book, but a book about the craft of knitting with inspiration from women of myth and history. In fact it's three books in one: a very nicely written book on mythical and biblical women, a book on how to knit creatively, and a book with some practical garment diagrams like shrugs and turtleneck pullovers.<br />There are no pictures of the projects, but you can visit a website created by the author to view some of  the knitted examples from the book.<br />I think this book would especially be good for handspinners of &quot;designer&quot; yarns, and also for those of us who collect odd balls of interesting yarns and fibers but aren't quite sure what to do with them.  I didn't expect to like this book, but I really am impressed.	2001-01-22

Yes, it is a classic. Yes, it documents the wonderful, adventurous time of the clipper ship. But that's not why you should read it.<br /><br />Richard Henry Dana must have been a most extraordinary man. While attending Harvard as a young man, his eyesight became weak and his health declined. He decided that the austere prescription of salt air and plain hard work would be the cure. Not many would give up comfort and privilege, but for two years, Dana served as a common sailor, given no special treatment as the gentleman he was, and lived in the forecastle of the Alert, eating the mess of salt beef and common hardtack, risking his life and serving under a captain crueler than most.<br /><br />Dana was able to write in such a way as to re-create the life on board a sailing ship, down to the smallest details and that's what makes this book so real and touching. You can feel the cold of Tierra del Fuego, taste the salt beef, and feel the wind and damp.  What's  more amazing is that Dana's carefully-kept journal was lost along with his other mementos of his voyage when he landed back on shore in Boston, due to some tragic carelessness of someone he entrusted with his chest of belongings. Yet he was able to recreate his voyage in loving detail and in some very excellent writing.<br /><br />Dana's later life as a lawyer was far from happy, though he made some critical contributions to maritime law. He died a poor and disappointed man, but left us the richer with his book. I just re-read it again for the tenth time, and it is fresher than ever. Read it along side of Moby Dick. It's American literature and American history and culture at its very best.	2001-01-21

This is THE sock book	The title is misleading in a way; while the book really does have genuine folk designs (and lovely ones too, I might add) the real value of this book is the beginning pages. These pages catalog different sock heel and toe styles and tell you essentially how to design any kind of sock for yourself.<br />If you want to knit socks, or if you love knitting socks, you really should have this book. For me, this is my most essential and most used reference book on sock and stocking knitting. Gottahaveit!	2001-01-21

The comfortably upper-middle class family of Ved Mehta was faced with a dilemna; how to educate a blind child in India, where there were really no provisions for a handicapped child. Ved's father made the difficult but brave decision to send him to a blind school, where he'd be surrounded by other children from vastly different backgrounds and religions, a difficult situation in India.<br />The exciting thing about the book is Mehta's ability to describe, with incredible detail, the feeling, sounds, flavors and smells of his daily life, while portraying his growth and increasing self-reliance. A really touching memoir and one worth reading.	2001-01-11

So if you are stuck for ideas for a party, you have a list of recipes that the author thinks would compliment each other.<br /><br />The menus are interesting, seasonally appropriate and well-balanced. If you don't choose to do a full menu, there are a lot of good recipes to choose from. My mom often bakes the \\"rich baguette\\", a milk-based bread dough. I make the Golden Pear soup but substitute squash for the yams.  There are also recipes for everyday cooking such as stir fries and variants on pasta and ramen. A note on that; instant soup ramen is really not a good food product--the noodles are fried to make them quick cooking and the soup base is just a lot of salt and MSG. And this book, though it's vegetarian, is not vegan. That's because this book was originally published in 1988. There are many things in here that would not pass muster anymore in vegetarian communities. And the sweets are very sweet. The empanadas are essentially a water-flour noodle dough. Typically, an empanada would have lard or shortening in the dough. Some people use wonton wrappers. I would not use this dough recipe.<br /><br />It's hard to pick my favorite recipe from the book (pear soup? rich baguette? Lentil chili? Chocolate eclipse?) Not all the recipes are winners, but there are enough of them to make this a favorite cookbook. The illustrations are pleasing if you like oil pastels. No photos for those who work off pictures.	2001-01-11

Fragrant with memory and wonderful descriptions of exotic places, it's a fun read as well as informative--just a lovely, little book.<br />But the real worth of this book is the listing of coffee varietals, from Abyssinian (I mean Ethiopian, but that doesn't begin with \\"a\\") to Zaire. Roden's description of the flavor of these different coffees is surprisingly accurate; we had a Costa Rican brew and checked it against her listing and found it was right on the money. If you are tempted to try a new variety at your local roaster and don't know what \\"saucy, yet mild\\" means in terms of flavor, you should refer to Roden's book instead.<br />There are also recipes for coffee-flavored desserts and little \\"to be served with the demitasse\\" sweets like apricot balls stuffed with pistachios. Hard to resist. So, don't.	2001-01-11

Zilboorg is  a master of colorwork, not a surprise as she works as a hand dyer of wools.<br /><br />The book features the cast-on method for Eastern (Turkish) socks and it is a bit wierd; even after a lesson I had difficulty to do it. But this book explains it very well.<br /><br />I personally don't knit Turkish socks if I want a pair of utilitarian socks in a hurry. But I do use this book if I want a special pair for clogs or sandals, or a pair of slippers in bright colors. You can use the charts for other things, like vests. There is a companion book of mittens using similar techniques. If you love colorwork, this book is inspiring.	2001-01-10

And not every hat will work for everyone (I found the Toque too small, the onion too big, but gauges vary.) The best hat in the book is the pentagonal hat, which seems to look good on everyone. The textural additions to the colorwork are really something. You can develop your own hats from these ideas, and use some of the texture ideas on things like mittens, too. I use the toque pattern,modified, with boucle yarn to make a Dr Zhivago-style hat, for example.	2001-01-10

Inspired by French Impressionism, yet unmistakably American and bold, Maurice Prendergast's park scenes are lively and idiosyncratic, yet evoke the times and flavors of 19th Century Boston and New York.<br />The Public Garden watercolors in particular are worth study. Watercolors are exhibited on tour only infrequently, as the paper and pigments are so sensitive to light. So enjoy seeing an retrospective at home with this book. A worthwhile reference if you love watercolor and Impressionism.	2000-10-17

Also a very creative sort of book, with a companion poster that illustrates the socks. I am still not sure which one I want to knit,  however. Maybe none of them--just use the designs for inspiration.<br />If you  aren't au fait with the toe up knitting method, you'd be better off getting  the Magnificent Mittens book along with this book; the explanation of toe  up knitting is the same as tip-down-mitten knitting. The illustration and  explanation is better in Anna's mitten book. Plus you can adapt the mitten  patterns to the sock methods. All in all, this is a fun book that can  expand your sock knitting horizons. Anyway, get it as these books evaporate  into out-of-print land all too fast.	2000-07-27

Another great knitting book this year	This has been quite a year for great knitting books. And Cheryl Oberle's book on shawls is not to be missed.<br />The photography is really outstanding. Cheryl models her shawls in such a way to show the beauty of  the shawl and at the same time make an artistic statement.<br />The shawls  represented are quite varied; most are done, however, in sport weight yarn.  This is convenient for those who don't want to attempt a project in  cobweb-fine laceweight yarn. However, directions are given if you do want  to change the yarn weight to suit your tastes.<br />The schematics include a  layout of the shawl shape (oblong, diamond, triangle, etc) and the lace  patterns are charted in many cases.  There is a nice section on  techniques.<br />All together, a really fine volume in the folk series from  Interweave Press.	2000-05-31

Best  of all, it teaches all-important techniques such as choosing the right  yarn, the right sized needles for the yarn and blocking--stretching the  lace project when completed.

His writing is nothing short of miraculous; lyrical,  clear and touching. Jan Yoors also wrote a follow up book (Crossings) about  his years in the Resistance during WWII.

If this is true, then Stephen Beal is smitten. He translated his love of the subtly shaded colors of DMC embroidery floss into poems that bring up conflicted emotions of his childhood and sexuality. Some of the emotions are painful to read about. And that is the success of this book; the poems split open a life and show you the not-so-tidy parts that make it up. I've re-read this book several times and, just like an emotion, it is never quite the same each time it is experienced. I think this book is a success as poetry and an autobiography of the most intimate kind.	2000-01-09
