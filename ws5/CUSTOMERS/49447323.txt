Considering the world's collective madness involving the threat of nuclear war and having children cower under desks in schools, madness abounded in those days.  Ken Steele's was sadly adolescent onset pychosis as opposed to the mass hysteria that was the order of the day.  He was first hospitalized following that episode.<br /><br />Steele's mental illness included paranoia; he feared going out in public and thought others were talking about him.  When Steele's brother Joe was born in 1964, he felt further alienated from his family.  On January 2, 1966 Steele left his home for good.  Sadly, he served time in and out of hospitals for the next 15 years.<br /><br />In 1974, one door opened.  Steele, calling home from an institution out of state received his first invitation home in nearly a decade.  Sadly, this visit did not pan out and he was back in the throes of mental forces he could not control.<br /><br />In 1991, Steele's luck changed for the better.  He was well matched with a Brooklyn therapist named Rita Seiden who responded to him with compassion.  I like the way she explained his mental illness to him and treated him with respect at all times.  He was referred to a Dr. Casimir in 1994 who prescribed Risperdal.  Steele began taking it in November of 1994 and on May 3, 1995, his voices stopped.  For the first time since 1962 he was free of auditory hallucinations.<br /><br />While working with Dr. Casimir, Steele took up the banner of securing the vote for mentally ill persons.  His contention that \\"mentally ill does not mean mentally incompetent\\" was on target.  In late 1994, he began working tirelessly to secure that right for people with mental illnesses.  In the late 1990s, Steele became a publisher of \\"New York City Voices: A Consumer Journal for Mental Health Advocacy\\" and an editor of a monthly newsletter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and spoke on behalf of the National Mental Health Association's \\"Partners In Care.\\"  One thing that comes through quite plainly in this book is that Ken Steele was a truly good man.  A truly good man.  This book will touch many hearts.<br /><br />Sadly, Steele never met his brother's children.  His voice was stilled on October 7, 2000.  This book might make you cry, but Ken Steele will certainly inspire you.  His was a life etched in pain, emphasized by his compassion and his tireless quest to help others in his shoes.  Reading this book will leave an indelible impression on all readers.<br /><br />God bless Ken Steele.ehalf of the National Mental Health Association's \\"Partners In Care.\\"  One thing that comes through quite plainly in this book is that Ken Steele was a truly good man.

He is the only child of a bright couple and his best friend, Rise is one of his biggest influences.<br /><br />Jesse and Rise grew up together.  When Rise, 17 turns to crime and joins the Counts, a local street gang and insists on bringing Jesse in with him along with their friend C.J., Jesse starts to reassess their friendship.  He sadly realizes that he and Rise are traveling down different streets; the drive-by shooting of their friend Bobby, 14 has left the neighborhood shaken.  C.J., a musical prodigy who plays piano in their church also has his sights set on a different path.  It is C.J. and Jesse, a budding young artist who is quite talented at drawing who realize they have more in common with each other.<br /><br />Rise and the Counts are in for a Count-down; sadly, drive-bys claim more casualties.  The Counts were described as being on the tame end of street gangs; a warring faction called the Diablos were responsible for shooting a friend; killing a cabbie and later, some members of the Counts.<br /><br />Sidney, a kind and fair police officer takes the boys under his wing.  He is respected in the neighborhood and word on the street was that he was a fair man, which he was.  When Mason, 19 an older member of the Counts was busted for homicide, it was Sidney who took Rise and Jesse to the jail (\\"Iron City\\") to see the fate in store for their former friend.<br /><br />More problems crop up in the neighborhood; Rise, seeing a chance to leave Harlem wants to call Jesse and the Counts together for a final goodbye.  Sadly, that goodbye really was the end.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that reflects the city and street culture well.  The characters are fresh, cutting edge, serious and believable.  The drawings were excellent and a bonus to this book.  Jesse, an aspiring cartoonist created two West Indian charcters, a wise man and a bird.  The bird was a metaphor for Jesse and it is through this avian character that he asks questions in his drawings that Wise answers.

Jeff, 17 dreads the day his 21-year-old brother Troy is returning home.  Troy served 5 years in a New York State penitentiary for murdering a classmate.  Troy's infamy and history of violent, erratic behavior acted as a toxic substance in the family and Jeff suffered fallout from his brother's bad reputation.<br /><br />Troy's homecoming is somewhat anticlimactic.  Their father's friend, Walter Smith hires Troy as a bag clerk at his grocery store.  A genuinely kind and fair man, Smith believes in giving people chances and, in an amazing show of faith allows Troy access to the cash registers.  Smith's son, nicknamed \\"Smitty,\\" is much like his father - a big, gentle boy, he cries over the plight of loggerhead turtles, dolphins, fish and other marine life.  He has a heart as big as he is.<br /><br />Jeff has a lot to contend with.  After years of keeping Troy a secret, he reluctantly disclosed Troy's existence and the family secret to his girlfriend, Beth.  This results in her father forcing her to break up with Jeff.  Jeff's English teacher, a brilliant man whose scientific career was derailed by an insensitive professor encourages his pupils to ponder philosophical issues.  A progressive man, he insists his pupils shoot for the stars.  It is plain he cares a lot about his pupils.<br /><br />Jeff and his classmates play an especially cruel prank on a vulnerable student who never forgives them.  Once the cat is out of the bag, the boy who'd been tricked attacked the prankster, which resulted in an act of violence.  Jeff, too is targeted for violence when his teammates beat him in the shower after another classmate goes missing after a run-in with Troy.<br /><br />Troy, meanwhile is noxious gas in the family.  He brings suspicion into the house; he is at the top of everybody's short list when Jeff's classmate disappears.  The local police hound the family and finally, Troy moves to a neighboring town.<br /><br />In time, Jeff finally goes to visit Troy.  He unearths facets of Troy's personality that he never knew existed.  In spending a day with Troy with some hair raising experiences, Jeff decides that walking on the wild side is not for him.  As he leaves Troy yet again, he discovers clues that lead him down an very dangerous path.<br /><br />This is a very intense and serious book.  There are parts that might make you cry.

Kudos to Donna Williams for debunking the tired stereotypes about peopel with autism. I like the way she insists the \\"experts\\" be held accountable and gives in-depth, analytical reasons for problems that exist with many existing forms of treatment. Williams' suggestion of having different methods of treatment converge under one umbrella to serve the individual needs of the autistic population sounded very logical indeed.<br /><br />This scholarly work is detailed but not tedious; factual and direct. Each chapter is broken into subsections that focus on a particular issue, e.g. education, physiological \\"firings\\" in the brain; vitamins; medicines; sensory responses; information processing and developing langugage. The book also has an Appendix which includes good practical advice about working with people with autism. Her inclusion of national as well as international organizations is invaluable.<br /><br />Williams raises some excellent points in her book, e.g. exposing the myth of \\"hug/holding therapy\\" as being a panacea for neurological conditions. Many people with autism find hugs restrictive. The onslaught of sensory input during enforced hugs makes an unpleasant activity even more so. Insisting that people \\"hug on cue\\" is unnatural and does not engender love. People forced to suffer through this treatment will, as she rightfully points out, outwardly go along with it until they are released. It does not change the neurology or the feelings of the autistic person; this method is just a stop-gap approach that meets the hugger's need and not that of the person with autism. It also appears to be a very self serving form of treatment and one that should be called into question. It is also a form of manipulative control. Very little attention has been given to \\"unpleasant\\" hugs and the rights of people who don't want to be hugged in the first place. There are many people, autistic and neurotypical who are not overly fond of hugs and find them intrusive.<br /><br />I felt the book did an excellent job of providing a wide array of information about autism in a \\"reader friendly\\" format. A person with autism is by far and away the best authority on the subject. This book is like a magnet; readers will continue to be drawn to it and will continue \\"dipping into it\\" for information and guidance. This, as with any work cannot be all inclusive and cover every single item. Still, I feel it is exceptionally well done and one every educator, parent, person with autism should not be without.

For people who have AS or are directly involved with someone who does, make this book your best friend.  I like the way the author says that AS \\"does not become fatal\\" nor is it miraculously cured by the time a person turns 18.  AS is not limited to children; children with AS become adults with the condition.  Lovett's darts hit the description, definition and issues in re AS right in the bull's eye and punctures neurotypical (NT) myths about AS.  This book deserves a place of honor.<br /><br />The chapters are logically laid out and clearly identified with the subject matter being covered.  Helpful vignettes involving people with AS are included along with discussions about the vignettes and the issues involved.<br /><br />One of the greatest services this book does is to state that AS, which is the spectrum partner of autism is not a mental illness, but a neurobiological condition.  AS is NOT caused by poor parenting and neglect; there is no medication for it and stupid myths such as these have long been disproved as being the crocks of bull that they always were.<br /><br />Examples of interaction; discussion of accomodations being made for people on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum on jobs and parents with AS are included.  This is a book no adult with AS should be without.  It is also an excellent teaching tool for the neurotypical (NT) population as well.  This book has something for everybody and I can't recommend it highly enough.	2005-09-30

She decides to work her way up from the ground floor, literally.  When Lucy meets single mother Marie, her son Matthew, 4 and Matthew's helper, Maougo, she is determined to get to know Matthew better.  Matthew has autism.<br /><br />Marie explains autism as best she can; Matthew likes to spin himself as well as discrete objects; he had difficulty in pronoun usage; his verbalizations are sporadic and he quotes what he hears from television.  He is bound to routine and insists on listening to his favorite tape each night.  Maougo appears to have rapport with Matthew and lets him play with her hair, which seems to be one of his favorite activities.  Upon meeting Lucy, Matthew plays with her hair.<br /><br />I didn't like the way Bettelheim was quoted, calling autistics \\"empty fortresses\\" who are \\"trapped within their own walls\\" and don't communicate which simply isn't true.  Bettelheim was not a real psychoanalyst, as the author claims he was in this book.  The definition Lucy's seemingly impersonal parents give her for autism is also unsatisfactory as is the dictionary definition she finds, which said autism is a \\"pathological withdrawal into an interior world resulting in a loss of contact with reality and an inability to communicate with others.\\"  That is not true.<br /><br />Autism is a neurobiological condition that is NOT caused by one's parents, as Bettelheim claimed and is NOT an inability to communicate.  Marie was a good mother to her son.  It is true that autism affects communication, but it is a condition that primarily affects sensory processing and integration.  That in turn affects communication.<br /><br />I would have thought that by this day and age such misperceptions about autism would have long been disabused and permanently put to rest.abused and permanently put to rest.	2005-09-25

In 1957 when Jessy Park was born (called \\"Elly\\" in this book, but later identified by her mother in the sequel \\"Exiting Nirvana\\"), very little was known about autism.  Elly/Jessy presented behavior that Kanner described more than a decade earlier (1943) when he first coined the term \\"autism.\\"<br /><br />Elly/Jessy was largely nonverbal for much of her childhood and had difficulty connecting names to people.  She loved mathematics and could do complex equations and recognized many polygons.  She developed a fascination for counting that has since stayed with her.  In 1961, Elly/Jessy then nearly 4 was formally diagnosed with autism.  She was enrolled in special needs programs and made progress.  She also as is noted in \\"Exiting Nirvana\\" proved to be a very talented artist.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that chronicles in minute detail autistic behavior and a family's love and acceptance.  Elly/Jessy's three older siblings love her unconditionally as do their parents.  Theirs is an intellectual family whose literary pursuits are quite evident throughout this account.  It is one of the best early personal accounts of autism in a family.<br /><br />What makes this book unique is that when it was published, it rightfully challenged the parent blaming routine that was the order of the day.  Elly/Jessy had three neurotypical (NT) siblings which automatically flies in the face of the disproven and completely asinine parent blaming.  At no time was she neglected.  She was loved, nurtured, encouraged and accepted.<br /><br />Her special interests in counting and polygons are recognized as an asset, an ability.  Fortunately, she is not charged with \\"perseverating,\\" a harmful and damning word that has caused more harm than it ever helped.  It is an extremely judgmental, negative and destructive word in any tense that is best avoided.  At no time is that harmful word ever applied to the NT population and the behavior is not limited to the autistic population either.  That word is best replaced with \\"special interests,\\" \\"repetitive verbalizations / behaviors\\" which are more accurate and also speak to tolerance whereas \\"perseverate\\" simply does not.<br /><br />The book closes with Elly/Jessy at age 8, making progress in her way and at her speed.  She and her mother have blazed new trails that continue to weave throughtout autism awareness and acceptance today.cial interests,\\" \\"repetitive verbalizations / behaviors\\" which are more accurate and also speak to tolerance whereas \\"perseverate\\" simply does not.

An orphan living with her unnamed aunt, whom she refers to as Aunt throughout the book, she is brought to the institution in late 1962 and serves several months.  Her sentence ends in the winter of 1963.  The girl's parents were killed in an automobile accident on January 12, 1957.  Gwen witnessed their traumatic deaths.  One wonders if this early trauma led and fed into her later fear, beginning in 1961 about atomic destruction.<br /><br />Gwen has an unusual fear of atom bombs and the mass hysteria of nuclear bombing.  Although the reason or reasons for her sentence to the institution are never made clear, one can surmise that it is this heightened fear, bordering on hysteria that prompted the decision to incarcerate her.<br /><br />It is interesting that Alice, Gwen's closest friend and ally on the ward suffers from anorexia, a then-little known condition.  Alice refuses to eat; pockets her food or sneaks it into a napkin for disposal during meals and is described as \\"a skinny scarecrow\\" who fears becoming fat.  The other girls have a range of issues - one talks to imaginary people; another is delusional and the like.<br /><br />In June of 1963, Gwen sees a cherry-breasted bird with a key in her beak.  She sneaks off the ward and through the fallout shelter in the institution basement (that really heightened her fear about atomic destruction) and onto the grounds.  She finds the key the bird drops and hides it on her person, knowing staff will take the key if they find it.  A kindly grounds worker sees her and brings her back inside after smoothing things over with the redoubtable head nurse.  From there, Gwen is reassigned to a kind, progressive-thinking psychiatrist, Dr. Stone.  (This is strongly reminiscent of \\"The Secret Garden\\" when Mary Lennox followed a robin and discovered a closed up garden on her uncle's spacious grounds).<br /><br />Setbacks occur on the ward; Alice dies and Gwen grabs the head nurse to \\"shake the truth out of her.\\"  Straitjacketed and left for hours in the seclusion room (seems like an excessive punishment in this case), Gwen's prison is transformed into a forest.  Each time she rubs the key, the institution becomes a kitchen or a forest.<br /><br />A hazy, muted story not unlike the literary equivalent of a Monet painting, readers are left wondering if the kitchen and the forest exist or if they were the products of a young girl's imagination.  Sounds like a good survival tactic to me - in that environment, escapism, even if only in the mind is understandable.  It is interesting to note that Gwen's \\"return\\" from the earth kitchen takes place on October 9, 1963, John Lennon's 23rd birthday.  Her doctor, Dr. Stone was truly a delightful character and a kind, progressive-thinking man.<br /><br />Still, it is an interesting look at the pre-Beatle 1960s (by 1963, the Beatles were a household name in the U.K., but not America) and the issues of the day.jacketed and left for hours in the seclusion room (seems like an excessive punishment in this case), Gwen's prison is transformed into a forest.

When she returns, she discovers her favorite ribbon missing and accuses Lucille.  Miffed, Lucille defends herself and Rosie withdraws her invitation to her birthday party.  Since Lucille's hair looks like a chopped and cropped haystack, logic rules out her immediate use for ribbons.<br /><br />The party's a bust without Lucille and her chubby dog; even the kindly neighbor, Mr. Brown and his free treats at his store don't restore Rosie's spirits.

While the benefits of hugging have been proven and documented, there is the very real flip side of misapplied hugs and unwanted hugs.<br /><br />Dr. Welch has banged on the drum for years about what she calls \\"holding time,\\" but there are the very real needs of those for whom this treatment is undesirable. For example, many people with autism dislike hugs/holding because of a) the sensory onslaught, e.g. body and/or perfume odors; b) hugs can be too tight and therefore unpleasant and c) in many cases involving severely autistic individuals, hugs are often viewed as punitive restraint.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me about this is Dr. Welch has long advocated this \\"holding time,\\" but scant attention has been paid to the downside this can have. In Catherine Maurice's book, \\"Let Me Hear Your Voice,\\" she chronicles the problems with this method. In many instances, children as young as pre-school age were brought in for \\"holding,\\" all the while being shouted at and told how they [the children] placed unreasonable demands; wanted their way (who doesn't) and, in effect were hurting the family. That kind of thing made me want to run for cover! The premise of this being to choreograph anger (the parents were actually TOLD to be angry at their children and scream these kinds of things at them), all the while inflicting these restrictive hugs.<br /><br />Welch's method smacks of quackery to me. I was also repelled by people following the order to lick their children like dogs do their pups. Welch, along with the Tinbergens and Bettelheim claim that restraint and unnatural hugs will \\"cure\\" autism. That most emphatically is not true! Being autistic has nothing to do with unresolved issues in a parent/caretaker-child relationship. Autism is a neurobiological condition. All the enforced hugs in the world won't cure autism. The enforced hugs were bad enough, but in some cases, Dr. Welch had people \\"straitjacketing\\" their children by rolling them up firmly in blankets, further restraining them. That sounded atrocious and appalling to me. To add insult to injury, she all but blames parents for causing their children to have autism! Her \\"followers\\" sound like they've been sold a bill of goods.

While the benefits of hugging have been proven and documented, there is the very real flip side of misapplied hugs and unwanted hugs.<br /><br />Dr. Welch has banged on the drum for years about what she calls \\"holding time,\\" but there are the very real needs of those for whom this treatment is undesirable. For example, many people with autism dislike hugs/holding because of a) the sensory onslaught, e.g. body and/or perfume odors; b) hugs can be too tight and therefore unpleasant and c) in many cases involving severely autistic individuals, hugs are often viewed as punitive restraint.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me about this is Dr. Welch has long advocated this \\"holding time,\\" but scant attention has been paid to the downside this can have. In Catherine Maurice's book, \\"Let Me Hear Your Voice,\\" she chronicles the problems with this method. In many instances, children as young as pre-school age were brought in for \\"holding,\\" all the while being shouted at and told how they [the children] placed unreasonable demands; wanted their way (who doesn't) and, in effect were hurting the family. That kind of thing made me want to run for cover! The premise of this being to choreograph anger (the parents were actually TOLD to be angry at their children and scream these kinds of things at them), all the while inflicting these restrictive hugs.<br /><br />Welch's method smacks of quackery to me. I was also repelled by people following the order to lick their children like dogs do their pups. Welch, along with the Tinbergens and Bettelheim claim that restraint and unnatural hugs will \\"cure\\" autism. That most emphatically is not true! Being autistic has nothing to do with unresolved issues in a parent/caretaker-child relationship. Autism is a neurobiological condition. All the enforced hugs in the world won't cure autism. The enforced hugs were bad enough, but in some cases, Dr. Welch had people \\"straitjacketing\\" their children by rolling them up firmly in blankets, further restraining them. That sounded atrocious and appalling to me. To add insult to injury, she all but blames parents for causing their children to have autism! Her \\"followers\\" sound like they've been sold a bill of goods. Since there is no scientific evidence to support Welch's claims, the whole concept seems very dubious to me.<br /><br />I knew a boy who survived this treatment and hated it.

Ben has trouble accepting the diagnosis and in time the marriage dissolved.<br /><br />Instead of condemning Elijah to a life of labels and misperceptions about autism, Valerie Paradiz educated her small upstate New York community as well as the world at large in this book about her personal experiences with autism.  Her son and father are both on the spectrum and this book is one of many that points out the genetic basis autism has.<br /><br />Elijah was enrolled in special programs from the age of three and his greatest progress is made at home and with a friend he and Valerie meet.  Sharron, an independent artist is herself struggling with Asperger's, the spectrum partner to autism.  She recognizes in Elijah similar traits and experiences she contends with and finally receives a diagnosis.  She bonded immediately with the boy and was his regular sitter for some years.<br /><br />I like the way Valerie worked with Elijah; I like the way she taught him more appropriate ways of responding to peers, such as Trevor in the chess club.  Trevor came away with empowered with knowledge and a chance to be more accepting of someone he sees as being \\"different\\" and Elijah understands what he can do to regulate his behaviors and move more comfortably in social circles.<br /><br />I like the conversations mother and son had; I also like the outdoor programs for people on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum that are described in the book.  Best of all, having autism is CELEBRATED!<br /><br />I've banged on the different drum for a long time about how being on the a/A spectrum is something to celebrate.  People on the spectrum have novel perceptions and unique insights that many neurotypical (NT) counterparts do not.  One misperception is that people with autism all think in pictures, which simply is not true.  Ben Levinson, co-author of \\"Finding Ben\\" and Sean Barron, co-author of \\"There's a Boy In Here\\" are not picture thinkers and neither are many other people on the a/A spectrum.<br /><br />Meltdowns due to sensory overload are not uncommon among the spectrum.  Sadly, the NT world often looks askance at those on the a/A spectrum simply from a lack of understanding of what people with autism contend with on a routine basis.  Elijah, for example would vomit during thunderstorms as the noise upset him.  I like the way another reviewer said in re a/A, \\"Vive la difference!\\"  Wave that banner of interlocking puzzle pieces proudly - autism is NOT something to be ashamed of having!<br /><br />Two songs seem to underscore this book so perfectly - Herman Kelly & Life's \\"Let's Dance to the Drummer's Beat\\" and Linda Ronstadt & the Stone Poneys 1968 song, \\"(Beat of a) Different Drum.\\"  With more drums beating, you get quite a tune!  With more drums being beaten, you have different drummers!<br /><br />People on the a/A spectrum enrich the world tremendously.  The contributions are NOT limited to Temple Grandin, Andy Warhol and Einstein and other public figures.  People with autism also provide ample opportunity to learn acceptance and realize the world is for everybody and not just the NT population.  All too often, people on the a/A spectrum are expected to make all the concessions, especially social concessions to the NT world and try to keep track of the Tacit Social Codes & Rules, which always seem to change at the whims of the NT world.<br /><br />Now let's all march to our different drummers.ere\\" are not picture thinkers and neither are many other people on the a/A spectrum.

This is one of the best books on Asperger's I have ever had the pleasure to read.  The young author gives an excellent accounting for spectrum related behaviors and accompanying emotions.  I just loved it when she described her outre wardrobe - her individuality and wonderful gift for expression is what makes this book so good.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts was when Nita Jackson said how it was hard being happy for the good fortune of others.  While it is only natural to be glad things are going \\"terrifically well\\" for them, it IS difficult to keep envy at bay.  That is an excellent point - it is taxing to keep seeing others get the breaks, bonuses and benefits one also hopes to receive.  It makes me think of the 1964 Animals' classic, \\"It's My Life\\" where Eric Burden says, \\"it's a hard world to get a break in/all the good things have been taken.\\"<br /><br />I love this book.  I really do.  This is a book I wish I'd had all along and I can't recommend it highly enough.  It is not only an excellent explanation of life with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a neurobiological condition that shares a place on the spectrum with autism, it is a wonderful teaching tool for the neurotypical population.  If you have Asperger's, you will want to celebrate having it while and after you read this book.  Kudos to Ms. Jackson for reiterating the point that the world and acceptance is for all and not just the neurotypical population.  WE NEED THIS BOOK!	2005-09-15

This is an excellent teaching tool for families with children who have Asperger's Syndrome.  Kristi Sakai, the mother of three children with Asperger's provides excellent tips; explanations and vivid vignettes describing spectrum behavior. The book also includes funny little drawings that are clear and direct and people on the spectrum should have no difficulty decoding their expressions.  I love this book!<br /><br />Kristi Sakai was blessed with the gift of humor.  Humor is one impetus that keeps this book rolling.  I love her quick quips for judgmental comments people endure when their child is suffering during a meltdown or having trouble navigating on social territory.  This book really is a Godsend!<br /><br />One part that made me laugh was when Sakai wrote about a boy who disliked baths because of sensory issues and provided very real, very legitimate reasons for why he resisted enduring them.  I also like the way she provided an alternative approach to ensure his cooperation during an unpleasant activity.  The part that had me laughing was when she said her daughter Kaede, upon being needled about not liking to have her hair washed, said she didn't have to suffer that unpleasant activity - she poured the shampoo down the sink!  (Sounds like the kind of thing I would have done - only I poured shampoo in the toilet at that age or in the tub and said it was bubble bath).  In all honesty, hair washing is about the least favorite activity of many, myself included.<br /><br />Regardless of where on the spectrum you are, on or off or someone directly involved with people who do have Asperger's, you will get a lot of mileage out of this book and will often turn to it.  It is one of the best teaching guides I have ever come across.	2005-09-15

Dr. Henry lied to his wife, telling her Phoebe died at birth.  His nurse, Caroline Gill was instructed to leave Phoebe in an institution.  Caroline goes as far as the instution itself, but when she sees a nurse cutting a patient's hair short, telling her [the patient] that it \\"had to be done,\\" she fled.  She decided to raise the girl herself instead of sentencing her to an institution.<br /><br />The story is told from different perspectives; the most dominant voice is Caroline's.  Norah, Dr. Henry's wife pines for her daughter, but one cannot help but wonder why she does not question her husband or insist on visiting the grave.  The \\"loss\\" of this daughter negatively impacts on the Henrys' marriage; Paul, also suffers from the fallout of the deteriorating union.<br /><br />Although Caroline's assignment and her agreement to act in collusion with Dr. Henry are misguided at best, she does have Phoebe's interest at heart.  A friendly trucker she meets in a parking lot has a significant part in their lives as does the 1964 Ford Fairlane she drove to transport the child.<br /><br />Although parts of the story bothered me, it is a story that will resound in my memory.  That is the litmus test of good writing and good story telling.  It was a very riveting tale that covers several decades; it opens one month to the day after the Beatles' meteoric arrival in the U.S. and closes in the early 21st century.<br /><br />I was never able to like David Henry and his wife seemed a sad, pale ghost of a character.  I also didn't like the ending.  While one can cognitively understand why David made the decision to oust Phoebe from their family, it is impossible to support or condone it.  David in turn creates a Pandora's Box of sorts, again with Caroline's help of pictures of Phoebe that will, in time rock their world.  This is an author to watch out for - she is going places.e the decision to oust Phoebe from their family, it is impossible to support or condone it.

Sadly, the little hound suffers a trauma to her spine which renders her hind legs immobile.<br /><br />Surgery does not restore the hound's use of her hind legs, but she still gets around.  She drags herself with much effort.  Finally, her family orders a special dog cart that can be strapped to her chest.  Her buttocks rest in the cart and she can trot along, with her back end coasting on wheels.<br /><br />A delightful little book with comments, crayon markings and a beautiful little dachshund with a plucky, resilient spirit.  In fact, dogs who have suffered similar traumas as Gretchen who have been outfitted with such carts have been used as therapy dogs for people in hospitals, homes and nursing facilities.

In May of 1992, the then-12th grader was convicted of shooting one Mary-Jo Buttafuoco.  Buttafuoco's husband Joey had been conducting an affair with Amy during this period.<br /><br />Amy was convicted to a 5-15 year sentence; served time until 1999 and survived some seemingly insurmountable odds.  She was raped several times in prison in 1994; fellow cellmates hanged her publicly on television and even her lawyer was cited for sending her inappropriate correspondence.  Through it all, Amy stood tall; hung tough and survived hell.<br /><br />Mary-Jo Buttafuoco publicly pardoned Amy, which in turn led to her release from prison.  It takes a really big person to do what Mary-Jo did; it speaks volumes of good about her.  I actually cheered the day I read and saw the news of Amy's release.  During her sentence, Amy matured and did a lot of self-reflection - she realized that as a child, she had been granted more freedom than she was ready to handle.  Joey Buttafuoco betrayed her; he led her to believe he would be a loving and stable lover and instead was a statutory rapist with no regard for Amy at all.  In the years since 1992, Joey has demonstrated chutzpah and indifference in his interviews together with a complete disregard for his own family.  He and Mary-Jo parted company while he received a ludicrously light sentence of only a few months.  The hue and cry around this during that period resound to this day.  The statutory rapist gets a slap on the wrist and a wagged finger in the face and the young girl suffers a far greater hellish ordeal.<br /><br />Amy's book is serious, gritty and uplifting.  Her story is a lesson in forgiveness and not judging someone for a desperate act of poor decision making.  A skilled writer, she uses her talents for writing articles, including ones championing the rights of her fellow inmates.  At no time has she dodged responsibility for her actions; at no time does she lay blame on anyone else.  She even includes a list of suggestions of preventive measures to help people guide children away from making the kind of desperate decisions she made when she was in high school.<br /><br />In recent years, Amy has married and has 2 children, born in 2003 and 2005.  She has made a life for herself and has stood tall throughout.  She deserved a fair shake and I'm glad to see people were willing to give her that chance she deserved.  This is a book about redemption and hope and about the far reaching positive effects of extending a helping hand.a list of suggestions of preventive measures to help people guide children away from making the kind of desperate decisions she made when she was in high school.

Her older sister Abby, then 17 and home from boarding school brought with her a fully loaded computer.  Katie thrilled to the online world of cyber conversation.  It was in late 1995 that she met a cyber hawk/stalker who called himself Mark.<br /><br />Mark's influence was insidious; he seduces and lures Katie with blandishments and a seeming interest in her life and activities.  An accomplished pianist and nationally recognized swimmer from her school swim meets, Katie warms to the idea of someone taking an interest in her.  Her mother is more or less immersed in her job and her stepfather is not as involved with her life as one might think.  Her youngest sister Carrie, 4 years younger than Katie is the only one of the sisters who is the stepfather's natural daughter.<br /><br />Katie provides a rich description of her town; her school and the friends she has made.  Her writing is clear, direct and mature and her assessment of the decisions she makes sounds startlingly adult, especially so when one considers how young she is.  One unfortunate decision was when she agreed to meet Mark when he offered to fly from California to Texas to see her at a school swim meet.  He lures her with promises to come to his room where he seduces her.  Luckily, sexual contact was warded off when Katie's mother, coaches and hotel security come to the man's room after Katie's roommate wisely tipped them off.<br /><br />Sadly, Katie receives public censure for agreeing to meet Mark.  It was upsetting when her stepfather said that Katie \\"ruined a man's [Mark's] life.\\"  Not true.  Mark ruined his life by lying; by seducing young people, both girls and boys into taking trips with him in return for sexual favors.  After enduring some disastrous enforced therapy with therapists who were not well matched for her, Katie enrolls in a boarding school in a neighboring state.  That turned out to be a good move - her roommate was sympathetic to Katie's after-effects and agreed not to talk to any press should they arrive on campus.<br /><br />Katie faces her cyber stalker and her case became a landmark case in child safety and the Internet.  Katie met her stalker during the infancy of the Internet and it is through her tireless efforts; her family's support; her real friends including her very astute sounding roommate Penn as well as the agent from heaven, Agent Barndollar who not only successfully have \\"Mark\\" convicted, but who have helped pave the way for a safer internet.

It addresses the issues of behavior problems, e.g. meltdowns, routines, sleep and toileting issues and outlines behaviors that are often exhibited by children with autism.<br /><br />Neurotypical (NT) and people on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum alike will get a lot out of this book.  The clear, direct style of writing will certainly be appreciated by all readers.  It's just a good old common sense guide.<br /><br />To make a good thing even better, this booklet includes a list of helpful resources.  Soothing activities to ward off or help a child coming off of overload are given, such as a deep pressure massage and some soothing tapes.  George Harrison is ideal for musical relaxation.<br /><br />This book makes me think of the 1967 Beatle classic, \\"Getting Better All the Time.\\"  To this author's credit, no promises are made, but helpful approaches are suggested.	2005-09-06

This book touts the long disproved belief that autism is an emotional disturbance, which is a crock.  The interpretations have nothing to do with autism or the experiences of people with autism.  Autism is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing and integration and affects communication.  The condition varies among the indivuals who have it.<br /><br />Although interesting, do not, repeat, do not take this as gospel.  It is rife with fallacies and the holes poked into the discredited misperceptions are big enough to drive fleets of trucks through.  Read scholarly first person accounts such as the books by Edgar Schneider; Marc Fleisher; Temple Grandin and Donna Williams instead.	2005-09-06

Adam, 9 has Asperger's Syndrome and is not ashamed to admit it.  His good friend Josie understands that Adam's social blunders are more often than not part of the Asperger's Experience.  Adam has a very astute teacher who also understands Asperger's very well and does everything possible to keep Adam up to speed socially and make sure that he is fully included in all classroom activities.<br /><br />Every year, the school has Sports Day.  Adam dreads this because he is nonathletic and has no interest in sports.  Other kids make him the butt of their jokes, which intensifies his aversion for Sports Day.  The boy's teacher comes up with a wonderful idea - Alternative Sports Day!  Alternative Sports Day focuses on cognitive activities instead of physical prowess and the students are divided into small groups.  Adam has a turn at bat, so to speak because at last he is given a chance to shine!<br /><br />This is truly an outstanding book.  I like the way the cognitive activities are included so readers can also test their mental mettle.  A wonderful, very interesting story that will not only get one's mental juices flowing, but will remain in the minds of readers long after turning the last page.	2005-09-05

People so categorized tend to be highly talented in a specific area, e.g. music but display severely autistic behaviors.  Savantism affects less than 10% of people with autism, so its rarity makes for a more interesting study.<br /><br />This author observed people with savant talents and compared them with neurotypical (NT) counterparts and compares the different results.  Some of the people included in this book are gifted linguists; poets; musicians; painters; sculptors and mathematicians.  Respect for people with autism is paramount - the very term \\"splinter skills\\" is callously dismissive of real talent.  The NT population is always afforded the more accurate and gracious terms, \\"talented;\\" \\"gifted\\" and \\"expert\\" which recognize genuine talent and ability.  Splinter skill is only applied to the autistic population and its very connotation is that people to whom it is applied lack abilities in all other spheres.  Instead of viewing areas of expertise, e.g. artistic gifts as mental \\"splinters,\\" a more accurate and helpful description would be \\"gifted aspects of the mind\\" and \\"areas of talent.\\"<br /><br />Due to the stereotyping of the autism/Asperger's (a/A) population that the 1988 movie \\"Rain Man\\" has caused, the very term \\"Rain Man\\" is considered a slur among many a/A circles.  One fictitious character does not represent the a/A population and savantism, although rare, is as varied as there are individuals who have this form of autism.<br /><br />A very fascinating book indeed.	2005-09-04

Chelsea has severe autism; is nonverbal; has severe meltdowns; is devoted to routines and a gifted artist.  She loved doing detailed drawings of birds.<br /><br />Casey quotes long reams of facts; has memorized the Guinness Book of World Records; categorizes her geodes; kept her dolls lined up in alphabetical order based on the nationality they represented and knows the lines to many old movies.  She prides herself on not having autism like her sister.  She is in for a surprise!<br /><br />Casey had been homeschooled ostensibly to help her parents with her sister.  The twins had a home teacher during their early years; I did not like it when the girls' parents did not answer Casey directly when she asked why Chelsea's teacher worked with her as well.  At that time Casey did not know she had more in common with Chelsea than an identical genetic base.<br /><br />At 14, she is enrolled in the district high school and is paired with Scott in the Peer Mentoring Program.  Scott is very kind, patient and protective of Casey; he explains Social Codes &amp; Rules as best he can.  She takes everything people say literally and when told certain ice breaker comments upon meeting people, she uses them all.  She also tries to impress people with her chains of facts.<br /><br />Scott also helps Casey see that people who call themselves her friends while asking her to do their work for them are just taking advantage of her.  He also helps her learn to &quot;empathize&quot; by saying that she might ask how he's doing after he broke his arm.  He watches movies with her and turns the sound down and asks her how the characters might feel in given situations.<br /><br />In time, Casey realizes she has Asperger's, the spectrum partner of autism.  She is a wonderfully plausible character that people with Asperger's can relate to; like Chris of &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time,&quot; people with Asperger's will recognize themselves in Casey.  Her demand for order, e.g. insisting that her geodes and dolls be placed in a certain order; her social naivete and bewilderment over people's responses will certainly be recognizable.  It is through Scott's loving diligence that Casey learns that her father has Asperger's as well.  He is, by his own account &quot;a computer geek;&quot; his special interests include old movies and doing character voices.  Like Chelsea, he is bound to following a routine and does not like to deviate from it.<br /><br />Casey realizes that she shares a place on the spectrum with her father and sister.  One part that I just loved was when Casey, forced to endure a playdate as a young child pulled her playmate's hair when the other child wanted to play with her dolls.  Casey could not understand the rationale for &quot;talking&quot; for the dolls and wanted them to remain in the order in which she had placed them.  Since the playdate was more for the girls' mothers than the girls themselves, I just loved it when Casey asserted herself.  Even so, that gave a good example of spectrum behavior.<br /><br />This is an excellent book about acceptance; tolerance and understanding the confusion that people on the a/A spectrum contend with on a routine basis.  What makes this book all the more interesting is that it is about identical twins, who share an identical genetic makeup.  Scott even pointed out that in many cases involving identical twins and autism, only one twin has the condition.  All in all, an outstanding work.ey.

Nat Senator was born on November 15, 1989 just at the time more research and information was being done on autism and its spectrum partner, Asperger's Syndrome.  The oldest of three sons, Nat exhibited autistic behavior almost from infancy.  His language development was delayed; he sought comfort in sitting quietly, avoiding a noisy peer (\\"coming even\\" after sensory bombardment, a common behavior and coping mechanism among people with autism) and vigorously protesting noisy guests at a family Seder.<br /><br />At 8, Nat became a brother for the first time when Max was born.  Their yougest brother Ben was born when Nat was 14 and Ben was 6.  Max was described as the \\"peacemaker\\" and \\"trailblazer\\" who was able to interpret a lot of Nat's behavior.  Ben balanced out the fraternal temperaments with his direct, forceful approach.  He appeared to be Nat's counterpart as Nat was apt to retreat.  Max was also described as \\"wearing the mantle of the oldest brother\\" because of Nat's great needs.<br /><br />Nat was able to attend school with lots of support and made great progress.  The boy's mother wisely did not buy positive reports at face value; it was she who insisted that school staff place more emphasis on having Nat make eye contact and reduce his self-stimming behaviors.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Nat explained that his \\"silly talk,\\" as he called it which consisted of neologisms was his way of having something he did not have to explain to others.  He said that when people talked to him, their questions came at him too fast and he found that confusing and overwhelming, a common plaint among the autistic population.  His way of coping was to make soft sounds including neologisms because, as he said, that gave him \\"something he did not have to explain to others\\" and helped desensitize him to overwhelming sensory input.<br /><br />I like the way the family \\"made peace\\" with autism; at all times, Nat is accepted, taught and encouraged to make more strides.  The John Lennon classic, \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" could be the song that underscores the message of this book.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that includes good websites and addresses of organizations that work with people with autism and their families.

My chief complaint about \\"Rain Man\\" is that it has reinforced a stereotype. Savantism affects less than 10% of people with autism, so I admit to getting frustrated with the liberal application of the \\"Rain Man\\" term and description being so readily applied to people with autism. In fact, the very term \\"Rain Man\\" is offensive and considered a slur among many a/A circles. Many is the time I've wished I had an umbrella with the Autism Jigsaw pattern that said, \\"Rain Man Myth Busters.\\"<br /><br />To this author's credit, the issue of people with autism not knowing what their \\"undefined social differences were\\" and groping and coping with social cues that seemed elusive is valid. I like the author's claim that neurotypical (NT) people can learn from their autistic counterparts just how confusing the Tacit Social Codes & Rules can be. This knowledge can hopefully help children with autism today.<br /><br />However, I take issue with the stereotypes. Not ALL people with autism have avoid hugs. Not EVERYBODY with autism has a high threshold for pain or thinks in pictures. Applying these features to the entire a/A population is just as misleading as that tired image of Rain Man. These stereotypes are no less offensive. Saying that one knows about autism because they watched Rain Man, which is about one fictional character with a very rare form of autism is tantamount to saying they are a gourmet chef because they watched one cooking show.<br /><br />Autism, as with any condition is on a spectrum. There will be overlapping behaviors in people with Asperger's; that is, people at the higher end of the spectrum will exhibit behaviors that are readily identifyable as autistic. The assumptions this author makes are very misleading indeed.<br /><br />A generation ago, people with autism were often misdiagnosed and this in turn led to harmful treatments and inappropriate placements. How on earth can Shull support the claim that misdiagnosis and its resulting problems, e.g. inappropriate treatment ensured a better life is a mystery to me.<br /><br />Sadly, the term \\"autistic\\" often resounds a death knell to \\"normalcy\\" and a \\"fulfilling life\\" to the NT population. Low expectations are often placed on people labeled with autism which in turn leads to inappropriate treatments and placements. Each generation has its individual issues and problems, and this seems to be the unfortunate underbelly of this generation of diagnosticians.<br /><br />I am among the first to encourage people to work with the a/A population based on areas of strength as opposed to areas of opportunity and to his credit, Shull appears to do this in his fashion. While accounts of picture thinking are fascinating, it is misleading and just plain wrong to say that is the way all people with autism think. That just isn't true. Autism is as varied as individuals who have it and saying that one has to fit a certain paradigm hurts all and helps none.<br /><br />One size does NOT fit all. Shull's operational definition of success doesn't apply to all autistics OR to all NTs, either. I found myself wishing he'd give the \\"picture thought\\" concept a rest - not ALL people with autism think in pictures! The other part of this book that bothered me was that \\"picture thinking,\\" according to him is \\"abnormal,\\" which means any other type of thinking, e.g. language based is \\"normal.\\" I don't think one can measure such a thing. While there are people, most notably Dr. Temple Grandin, who has publicly described her \\"picture thinking\\" and even titled one of her books \\"Thinking in Pictures,\\" it does not mean that everybody with autism thinks that way. Donna Williams, another author with autism does an exemplary job of addressing the language interpretations of conversation and of language based thinking in \\"Autism: An Inside-Out Approach.\\" Many people I know with autism as well as NT will say that their thoughts are language based.<br /><br />I also did not like his claim that people who don't think in pictures can expect a better social outcome and are entitled to a \\"fuller\\" education, whereas picture thinkers do not. How does he explain Dr. Grandin, a self-admitted, self-avowed picture thinker?! How does he explain Georgiana Thomas, the daughter of Annabelle Stehli, who writes of Georgie's stellar progress in \\"The Sound of a Miracle?\\" Georgie, herself an author, has written \\"Overcoming Autism\\" which is currently available on her website. She is fluent in 6 languages including Arabic and she says her thoughts were always language based. How does Shull explain that? Georgie had severe autism as a child, but successful Auditory Integration Therapy (AIT) helped her progress to a point where her autistic tendencies had receded.<br /><br />Another thorn in my side was when the author said that people who don't fit his criteria are not autistic. Nobody would choose to be autistic, but for those who are, Shull appears to negate their experiences.

The gentle watercolor illustrations emphasize the gentle theme of this story.  However, the watercolors may prove distracting for some readers as people are given more of a blurred appearance and often seem to be part of the background scenery.  Many people with autism have difficulty decoding facial expressions and this \\"blurring\\" effect could add to that confusion.  Certain colors appear to be associated with certain emotions, such as the orange when one is angry.  I didn't like the orange shadings at all.<br /><br />While I didn't care for the orange faces, I loved the message and the subject of the story.  While Sammy appeared to fade into some of the scenery, I did not get the impression that the tired \\"autistic people prefer their own worlds\\" myth was being reinforced.  People with autism often have difficulty processing and responding to sensory stimuli and often find it overwhelming.  Responses can range from very intense to seemingly nonexistent, at which times the person is \\"coming even\\" after having endured an onslaught of sensory input.<br /><br />Sam's older brother is the narrator of this story and outlines the parallels of a routine day for him and for Sammy.  The boys' mother's unending refrain is that her younger son \\"is special.\\"  Even so, Sam's brother yearns for ways he can include him in their play and even wishes they attended the same school.  My favorite picture (probably because I feel it is the most accurate) is Sammy's look of intense concentration when he is watching the sand sift through his fingers.<br /><br />Sam's speech is mostly echolalic and his brother wishes they could converse.  Still, he is very accepting of Sam and very protective of him as well.<br /><br />I got tired of the mother's saying \\"because he is special\\" over and over and also wished more time was spent on describing autism and explaining what it is.

While there are people, most notably Dr. Temple Grandin, who has publicly described her &quot;picture thinking&quot; and even titled one of her books &quot;Thinking in Pictures,&quot; it does not mean that everybody with autism thinks that way. Donna Williams, another author with autism does an exemplary job of addressing the language interpretations of conversation and of language based thinking in &quot;Autism: An Inside-Out Approach.&quot; Many people I know with autism as well as NT will say that their thoughts are language based. <br />I also did not like his claim that people who don't think in pictures can expect a better social outcome and are entitled to a &quot;fuller&quot; education, whereas picture thinkers do not. How does he explain Dr. Grandin, a self-admitted, self-avowed picture thinker?! How does he explain Georgiana Thomas, the daughter of Annabelle Stehli, who writes of Georgie's stellar progress in &quot;The Sound of a Miracle?&quot; Georgie, herself an author, has written &quot;Overcoming Autism&quot; which is currently available on her website. She is fluent in 6 languages including Arabic and she says her thoughts were always language based. How does Shull explain that? Georgie had severe autism as a child, but successful Auditory Integration Therapy (AIT) helped her progress to a point where her autistic tendencies had receded. <br />Another thorn in my side was when the author said that people who don't fit his criteria are not autistic. Nobody would choose to be autistic, but for those who are, Shull appears to negate their experiences. There are many people with autism who have no common ground with the author's accounts and whose life experiences with autism just don't apply to the rules he has given. While this book starts out with a seemingly sound premise, it degenerates into sophistry and is very misleading.	2005-08-31

She had unusual fears, such as the color red, fruit skins and certain meats. Ann insisted on drinking from a bottle until she was 7, smelled foods to determine if she wanted to eat them and loved to aimlessly throw sand. She was also nonverbal until she was 8.<br /><br />Ann's father claimed he dreamed the word \\"violence\\" came into his mind in 1959 and that \\"violence\\" was the key to freeing Ann from autism. From that moment on, Ann, then 7 was slapped each time she screamed for no apparent reason or shied away from a usual object. For example, she feared the color red and was forced to wear red clothing and be bathed with a red sponge. Whenever she objected, she was slapped. The same held true for any other such bizarre fear she had.<br /><br />Ann had her tonsils removed when she was 8, the idea being that this would help her speak more easily. Her brothers were her best teachers and would protect her from the jeering she got from classmates in the special classes she attended.<br /><br />By age 14, Ann's autistic behaviors appeared to have receded to a much more socially acceptable level. By age 16, she appeared to exhibit no overtly autistic behaviors and even offered insights about what it was like having autism. She was officially prounounced \\"non-autistic\\" in 1968.  This remains questionable, as Ann's verbalizations were often quite naive and she played with dolls late into her teens.  She even went so far as to cut their hair to give them boyish appearances, yet insisted on giving them girl names.<br /><br />Many parts of this book bothered me, such as when developmentally delayed children in a special school were called \\"these poor deranged children.\\" I also think slapping is abhorrent. Nobody, not even the most self-flagellating of masochists will thank the slapper and say they \\"needed that.\\" How that false image got started is anybody's good guess.<br /><br />Slapping is painful and degrading and is just plain cruel. Ann's \\"recovery\\" is questionable; it sounds like she learned how to give the desired response so as to avoid further painful punishments. Donna Williams' brilliant work \\"Autism: An Inside Out Approach\\" does an outstanding job of describing autism, which is a neurobiological condition affecting communication and sensory processing as well as how certain \\"methods\\" just teach people with autism outward compliance so as to avoid further pain.

Trapped inside a body that he cannot control and a tongue that protrudes, Petey was committed to an insane asylum in Warm Springs Montana bearing the diagnosis of idiot. Once he is turned over to the state at age two, he never sees his family again.<br /><br />Petey's life is marked by a series of shift changes. Once admitted to the Infants' Ward where he resides for the first decade of his life, he meets an angel. The angel is a young ward worker named Esteban who responds to Petey and knows this child is no idiot. The two bond and Petey learns to nod his head and respond to words. Esteban brings Petey chocolates and sadly loses his job after he tells a group of visitors not to talk about the young residents in their presence or call them freaks. \\"They are NOT freaks,\\" Esteban tells them. \\"They are poor children!\\" Sadly, he is fired for taking this stand. That was in 1927.<br /><br />Petey languishes for a few years after Esteban's departure and, for the first time in several years is taken outside. This trip is his transfer from the Infants' Ward to the Mens' Ward where he will receive total skilled nursing care. Sadly, it is not an appropriate placement for this child as many of his ward mates suffer from a variety of mental illnesses.<br /><br />Fate intervenes; in the late 1930s a boy named Calvin was found freezing and abandoned outside the asylum doors. Admitted to Mens' Ward, he and Petey become good friends. Both wheelchair bound, the boys talk to each other with Calvin serving as Petey's interpreter. They even make pets out of the mice who come to eat scraps and crumbs. Their efforts are rewarded by their friendship with Joe, a kind ward worker who talks to the boys; gives them Christmas presents and takes a personal interest in them. Sadly, poor health forces Joe to retire, but he always sent the boys cards every year until his death.<br /><br />The next angel to enter Petey's life was a loving nurse named Cassie. Cassie's husband was in the armed services during WWII and she needed the job. Once at Warm Springs, she, too, is drawn to Petey and Calvin and takes them out on the grounds and lets them play with her infant daughter. Sadly, she leaves during the latter part of the war to join her husband, who has been stationed in New York.<br /><br />Life as Calvin and Petey know it becomes a metronome of monotony; they are ground into a routine until early 1965. An angel in a Chevrolet arrives at the gates; by then the asylum has been renamed \\"Warm Springs State Hospital.\\" Owen, a retiree and a widower picked up where Esteban, Joe and Cassie left off. He recognizes the bond between Calvin and Petey and he takes a special interest in the men. He even convinces the director of nuring to provide Petey with a better wheelchair.<br /><br />Owen retires in 1973 due to advanced age and poor health. He periodically visits his friends, but the pain of leaving them is great. Shortly after he retires, a \\"deinstitutionalization\\" takes place. Many of the residents are shipped to nursing homes and group homes based on their needs and level of care. During the winter of 1977-1978 Petey is admitted to a nursing home and Calvin a group home.<br /><br />Luckily, the nursing staff recognize Petey's intelligence and humor. They learn, as Joe and others before them to \\"translate\\" Petey's words. So does another friend Petey makes in 1990, an unlikely meeting with 13-year-old Trevor, a neighborhood child who protects Petey from bullies pelting him with snowballs. In time, the young boy and the senior citizen form a bond that is truly heartwarming. The friendship these two have takes them far and wide and -- back to old friends Petey made.<br /><br />This book makes me think of the 1965 Beatles classic, \\"In My Life.\\" The lyrics of that song underscore this wonderful book.<br /><br />This is one of the most moving stories I have ever read. This is a truly beautiful, uplifting, grim, serious, loving book. It might even make you cry. It is a testament to how love heals the spirit and is inclusive. I can't recommend this one highly enough. Please read this and share it with somebody.. This is a truly beautiful, uplifting, grim, serious, loving book. It might even make you cry.

83964:US	49447323	R1IWO5MMARWI0I	0060929596	316982155	As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl	Books	5	10	11	N	N	He's a Boy, He's a Boy, He's a Boy	This book makes me think of the Who classic, \\"I'm a Boy.\\" Studies have been conducted showing that male and female brains are \\"wired differently.\\" The male/female difference far transcends the external genitalia and chromosomes.<br /><br />Identical twins Bruce and Brian Reimer were born in August of 1965 in Canada. The boys suffered from a congenital genital condition called phimosis which made urinating painful. Their doctor recommended that the boys be circumcised. At 8 months, this procedure was underway. However, only Bruce was circumcised as the operation went horribly awry. The baby's penis was burned off, leaving a charred stump resting on his testicles. Brian, however was not circumcised.<br /><br />The Reimers' doctor directed them to a plastic surgeon at Johns Hopkins who performed a bilateral orchidectomy (removal of both testicles) on Bruce in late 1967. He recommended the child be raised as a girl and be given a girl's name similar to the one he was given. Bruce, renamed Brenda was raised as Brian's twin sister. Dr. Money consulted with the Reimers regularly for years and gave Brenda hormone treatments to increase his feminine appearance and development.<br /><br />Brenda never adapted to his forced gender reassignment. He never took to wearing dresses or being forced to play with gender biased girl toys. Brenda remained unaware of his forced gender reassignment until March of 1980. Ironically, prior to 1980, Brenda resisted his annual trips to Johns Hopkins for hormone treatment and therapy. Despite Brenda's obvious maleness and resistance to the enforced treatments, Dr. Money continued exploiting the family by writing erroneous claims that the gender reassignment went through flawlessly and seamlessly.<br /><br />Once Brenda learned the shocking truth behind his sexual identity, he point blank refused any more treatments with Dr. Money and refused to have additional surgery to create a more natural looking vaginal opening. He renamed himself David and began living as the male he was meant to be. Once off the hormone treatment, he grew facial hair; his voice deepened; he lost a lot of weight and grew.<br /><br />This is a fascinating look at the age old nature vs. nurture conundrum. Nature apparently emerged the victor as David was intended to be a male. I have long believed that nature is the guiding force and dominant determining factor. This book is a sympathetic, yet respectful look at proof of how nature is indeed the stronger imprint on sexuality and identity.<br /><br />The sheer arrogance of Dr. Money is indeed disgusting and upsetting; the Reimers were exploited by him for many years. Money even wrote books about how David, whose identity was concealed readily adapted to his new role as a girl. That was not true. David even said Dr. Money sexually abused him and his twin, Brian.<br /><br />In 2000 and 2001, David, his brother and mother appeared on TV interviews. They each refuted Dr. Money's claims that gender reassignment is a seamless process when performed on infants. This book includes accounts of other \\"intersex\\" children who were reassigned. One boy, now \\"Paula\\" and a person who had been gender reassigned, has to take hormone treatments for the rest of his life. One wonders if Paula's reassignment was even necessary. This is never explained.<br /><br />Bruce/David was 8 months old when his genitals were destroyed. Prior to when his testicles were removed, he had been raised as a male and recognized as one. The age-old gender bias can be found in how people react to children based on their gender. Tests have been conducted showing how people react differently to the same child when told the child is a boy or a girl. Money's claim that a baby's mind is a tabula rasa before age two is questionable; one can only wonder how he arrived at this false theory.<br /><br />Money's writings have done more harm than good and have led to truly asinine assertions, such as the \\"brain sex\\" theory that is currently being touted. The \\"brain sex\\" theory is to keep females from studying math and science and males languages and arts. Talk about deprivation! This is damaging to psyches as is the mutiliation of genitals that are malformed or people categorized as \\"intersex\\" gender.<br /><br />Clinical depression ran in the Reimer family; the twins' mother suffered from bouts of crippling depression and so did the boys.  One cannot help but wonder how much of their depression was caused by the trauma inflicted upon their family.<br /><br />Sadly, progress won't be enjoyed by David Reimer. He committed suicide on May 4, 2004, two years after Brian died of an overdose.udying math and science and males languages and arts. Talk about deprivation!

At 15, he has broken into a hardware store; damaged the place; bragged about his crime and severely attacked a schoolmate who turned him in.<br /><br />This is the latest in a series of violent and antisocial acts on Cole's part. Cole is quite familiar with violence; his own father, an alcoholic beats him at the drop of a hat while his impassive mother does nothing but reach for the bottle.<br /><br />Jailed and awaiting trial, Cole meets two unlikely allies. Garvey, a Native American parole officer and his partner. The two men suggest Circle Justice, an ancient Native American custom that recognizes the Circle of Life and the Circle as being a metaphor for the Continuum of Life. The first step is to have Cole, the Matthews, the parents of the boy Cole attacked as well as their son and other interested persons in their Minneapolis community. An Elder (or Keeper as she is known) starts the Circle off by insisting on full respect for the Feather; a person may only speak if he or she holds the Feather.<br /><br />Cole's start is anything but auspicious. The Driscals, whose son Cole attacked want him locked away for life; the Matthews appear disinterested in the boy while everyone else encourages the Circle Justice approach.<br /><br />Cole, Garvey and his partner leave Minneapolis for a remote island off the southeast coast of Alaska. There he is provided with a shelter and the men tell him they will check on him every few days and bring back supplies. Cole burns the shelter that first night and goes off on a tear. A 10-foot white bear lumbers over toward him and Cole is ready to kill it. No match against the beast, the bear mauls Cole, severely injuring him. The men return two days later to find Cole barely clinging to life.<br /><br />From there, he is transported by skiff to a mainland hospital and from there, to one in Minneapolis. After several months of intensive physical therapy, he is turned over to the juvenile justice system and locked away. Once again, his mentors go to bat for him, dispensing a tough love the boy had never encountered. They are somehow able to secure his release into their custody for Circle Justice, this time at the boy's request.<br /><br />Once on the island, Cole, quite humbled is ready to follow the instructions of the men and learn to live off the Alaskan wilderness. The men teach him the traditions of the Sacred Dances; to help him release his anger, they have him do an anger dance \\"but only when he is ready to do so\\" and to carry the Ancestor Stone up the mountain.<br /><br />Cole's redemption comes about with the Gift of Forgiveness. He extends himself to Peter Driscal, the boy he nearly killed at the beginning of the story. The road is a Long & Winding Road and the attempts at repair, redemption and recovery (the three R's) make for a very intense story indeed.

Kira Whitmore is a strong, intelligent woman who has her own business, an upscale resale shop in Los Angeles.  She is also a trained masseuse who is able to discern physical ailments in her clients and friends.<br /><br />Kira has trouble with one of her salesclerks, Adriana, who is still drawn to her previous life of prostitution and drugs.  Her other salesclerk is a smart, savvy lady who left an abusive relationship and is never at a loss for trenchant observations.<br /><br />Kira has major problems on the homefront.  The loss of an infant son to SIDS some several years earlier and an acrimonious divorce were two curveballs she had to catch.  An alcoholic mother who left her to be raised by her loving grandmother, called Ma Missy as well as the skip of a generation of mental illness to her daughter, Trina were crowning blows.  At 17, Trina suffered her first bipolar/psychotic break and was hospitalized several times.  Each time she was brought into the hospital, it was on a 72-hour hold.<br /><br />Trina's illness, like so many sufferers of mental illness occurs during late adolescence.  She is a National Merit Scholar with a scholarship to Brown and hopefully, a passport to a bright future.  During her manic phases, she becomes hostile and violent; broken windows, unflushed toilets and blows to her own mother are testaments of her violent side.  Trina refuses to take her medicine and often spends days away from home, self destructing into a vicious vortex of mental illness.<br /><br />Kira enrolls Trina in a \\"partial program\\" from 9-3 at the local hospital; if Trina were to suffer another break, she could be admitted directly.  The caveat is that Trina, having reached adulthood was legally able to keep hospital staff from disclosing her whereabouts or treatment to Kira.  Desperate, Kira seeks conservatorship and tries to enlist the aid of her ex-husband, Clyde Sr.<br /><br />Refusing to give up on Trina or, in the words of one doctor, \\"learning to love a stranger,\\" Kira will move hell and mountains to secure help for her child.  Support groups for parents and other relatives of mentally ill people offer little solace or sustenance; however it is through this group that Bethany, another mother of a severely mentally ill daughter provides Kira with a little known alternative.<br /><br />Disgusted with the Catch-22 of the Mental Health Services where people with mental illness have to display such violent behavior before they can be committed and with the 72-hour holds which just put patients out the door with little more than a \\"take your meds\\" directive, Kira begins seriously considering Bethany's suggestion.  Bethany puts her in contact with other parents who have had their children taken to a mental health site in an undisclosed location via underground methods.  Kira's analogy of the Underground Railroad is not only very apt; it provides an interesting historical perspective.<br /><br />The \\"Intervention,\\" or secret \\"kidnapping\\" and spiriting Trina and Angelica, Bethany's schizophrenic daughter away to parts unkown makes for some very intense reading.  It is impossible to tear oneself away from the book, especially when it reaches this critical point.<br /><br />A truly brilliant work about patients' rights, which is often at loggerheads with their best interests and the devastating affect mental illness has on families.  Trina's battle with psychosis and bipolar disorder is painful and heart-wrenching; Kira's desperation really touches the heart.  Campbell is a gifted author and the way she portrays a parallel between mental illness and antebellum slavery is nothing short of brilliant.  The shackles of mental illness; plantations and degredation are poignant and painfully vivid.  The diaspora of the mentally ill from institutions and hospitals onto the streets is a stark, yet vivid image that will stay with readers.<br /><br />Campbell provides readers with a look at how the legal system judges and responds to people with mental illnesses and what the legal ramifications, e.g. conservatorships involve.  Judgmental neighbors, relatives and others are called into question as they have pronounced far harsher judgment than any legal system.<br /><br />The characters are brilliantly created and believable; the dialog sharp and well defined.  This is a book that will no doubt leave indelible impressions on all who read it.

In 1992-93, the family moved from southern Minnesota to northern Minnesota. On a 1994 road trip, they crossed the Iowa border and it is there when Edward, seeing the long stretches of land and understanding the concepts of \\"borders,\\" says that they are nowhere and often told other children that he wanted to live \\"nowhere.\\"<br /><br />In northern Minnesota, Jack changes jobs and Rachel continues with her magazine work. Luckily her magazine has landed some lucrative accounts as the family had been in financial dire straits for a long time. Edward became nonverbal; his skin was described as pallid and ashy and his back had a series of strange looking marks that even the doctors could not explain. Edward's behavior became disruptive; at a story-time in a local library, the librarian roughly ousted Edward from the group and chewed Rachel out.<br /><br />Several years later, Edward explained his behavior by saying that when the librarian twirled a color stick, the colors hurt his eyes and distracted him. He would then look at the ceiling lights and play with the switches to \\"come even\\" after this sensory bombardment. What the boy described is not an unusal experience for people with autism.<br /><br />Edward somehow got through a public education with some support from the school and a lot of support from Rachel. He had a gift for math and could compute any multiplication and division problem he was given. He could also do very advanced math, much to the delight of his brother.<br /><br />Matthew understood Edward. When Edward had his tonsils removed at 5, he became verbal much to the delight of those who knew him. Matthew told Rachel that Edward's fear was \\"when people, smells and sounds get mixed up.\\" What an excellent description of the autism experience! Since autism is a sensory-neurobiological condition that does affect sensory integration and processing, Matthew's apt assessment of how frustrating it is for a person with autism who has difficulty in sorting out these various sensory modes.<br /><br />Matthew also taught Edward how to spell. When Rachel worked with Edward, then 6 on writing his name, Matthew was avidly paying attention. An early reader who was very bright and verbal, Matthew was ready to protect his older brother and keep him up to speed socially and academically. Matthew also accepted Edward unreservedly.<br /><br />Rachel does some family digging and learns that her maternal uncle Mickey, born in 1932 shared many behavioral traits with Edward. When Mickey's older brother Frank died from scarlet fever at age 12 in 1935, Mickey was devastated. Never very verbal, he retreated and spoke even less. His older sister, Eleanor, then 9 took Mickey under her wing and later, a younger sister, Susanna, born in 1936 watched out for her only brother as well.<br /><br />Mickey barely coped in school; was harassed by teachers and pupils alike; suffered from sensory overload and did not learn to read until he was 14. Luckily, he had a natural aptitude for baseball and that got him through his secondary years. He never qualified for a team after graduation and simply accepted that as he did not have the interest nor the desire to go into sports professionally.<br /><br />He served in the Korean War; discovered he had a flair for math and could mentally envision planes' aerial position; had a good job in the army; married in 1959 and had a son in 1960. He died shortly thereafter and his widow moved to Omaha with their son in 1967-68. Susanna relates this to Rachel. Every few chapters are about Mickey and his lifetime; to read these \\"Mickey\\" chapters interspersed throughout the book is effective in that readers have time to follow Edward's story as well as this historical perspective.<br /><br />A compelling book about love, loss, autism and acceptance. In 1997, Rachel's sister has her first child and Jack is facing betrayal and legal difficulties. The story closes in 2003 with Edward, then 15 surviving middle school in a world much more ready to accept him than his uncle knew decades earlier.s to Rachel.

The opening of this book really irritated me. The very statements that people on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum don't relate to others and that nothing registers are not only illogical, but are harmful fallacies. People with autism, which is a neurobiological condition have difficulty communicating and responding to stimuli based on the severity of the condition. Suggesting that nothing registers with people who have autism is a crock.<br /><br />I also didn't like the way people with autism were compared to Rain Man. Seriously, I wish that 1988 movie had never been made because I am really sick of the savant stereotype being dumped on the autistic population! The term \\"Rain Man\\" has become a slur in many a/A circles for this very reason. The irony of it all is that savantism only affects less than 10% of people with autism! I also wish I had an umbrella with the Autism Puzzle design, with the logo \\"Rain Man Busters\\" to ward off these tired misstatements. Saying one knows about autism based on one fictitious character is tantamount to saying that one has been to Paris when they've only been to Charles De Gaulle Airport!<br /><br />Tired, disproved myths about autism such as refusal to speak due to trauma and having no desire to communicate were rampant throughout this book.  Bull manure!  The desire to communicate is inherent in all people regardless of neurobiology and autism affects that part of people's lives.  The irony of it all is that Dr. Asperger, the man who first described this form of autism in 1944 wrote many works IN GERMAN about it as well as its spectrum partner, autism.

Dr. Asperger for whom Asperger's Syndrome was named recognized similar behaviors in 1944.  Those who specialized in treating people with autism more often than not relied on Kanner's, or Infantile Autism models.  Scant attention was given to Asperger's Syndrome, which is also considered to be a form of High Functioning Autism.  Sean, however was diagnosed at 4 with autism in 1965.<br /><br />Sean's behavior was indicative of autism from infancy.  He loved to drop things down the vent holes; self stim; throw toys up into trees because, as he later explained, he \\"liked to see things going up.\\"  Sean's mother developed a punitive relationship / response to Sean and, by her own admission was conditioned to respond negatively to him.  Sean later said he would not have been able to pick her out of a group of women until he was 5.<br /><br />Sean's sister Megan, born some 2 years later sounded like a really good influence on Sean.  I loved her aversion for dolls and displeasure over how too many books with female characters relegated them to gender biased activities.  Extraordinarily bright and verbal, Megan was Sean's biggest ally.<br /><br />Nonverbal until he was nearly 5, Sean's rigid eating habits and love for routine all pointed him closer towards the autistic end of the autism/Asperger's (a/A) scale.  Diagnosed at 4 and already medicated and in therapy, Sean's progress remained uneven.  One doctor actually spanked Sean after being told about how the boy screamed at restaurants whenever a glass of water was placed on the table.  I was thoroughly disgusted with the man and wondered why he was not brought up on charges.  He had no authority to so much as lay a finger on that child!  The boy's mother felt he was making some progress and continued with Dr. Rossi, which I just could not understand.  I was glad that Sean tuned him out.  I also loved it when Sean shook off his father and mother after he broke his arm in 1964-1965 so he could engage in his brand of play.<br /><br />Sean also tuned his own father out because, as he would explain later, he had a severe communication disorder.  Luckily for Sean, his father taught in their home district, so he was mainstreamed for the first few years.  His 4th grade year was traumatically interrupted when in February he was enrolled in an unsatisfactory boarding school.  He served 9 months there and was miserable.  I just loved it when Megan said she hoped Sean would forgive them for putting him that school.<br /><br />Once back in his home district, Sean continued to make acceptable progress in the class, but had trouble on the homefront.  In 1975-76, Sean's father, irate over the boy's seeming lack of responsiveness, snubbed him for 8 whole days.  Sean made every effort to get back into his good graces and it was so heartwarming when he succeeded.<br /><br />It was interesting that Sean knew he was autistic since he was 10.  He was lucky to have had this information.  Even so, social nuances remained a challenge; another setback occurred in February of 1976 when his beloved maternal grandmother died.<br /><br />Since autism and Asperger's are on the same neurosensory spectrum, there tends to be overlapping behaviors.  As Sean got older and cognitively learned social expectations, his behavior moved him closer toward the Asperger's end of the spectrum.  His poignant wish to \\"get a sense of humor\\" when he was in middle school was indicative of how subtleties, including humor are often learned \\"cognitively\\" by people on the spectrum.  He also had to be taught why jokes worked; how; and why timing and delivery were important.  Inane sitcoms such as his beloved \\"Gilligan's Island\\" was a very limited and restrictive portrayal of one type of humor.  Still, Sean made strides.<br /><br />More changes were on the way; he suffered through a megavitamin regimine and was luckily withdrawn from it.A group of bullies were called in on their cruelty to Sean; they were told that Sean had autism and one boy even apologized and never once harassed him after that.<br /><br />In 1978 the Barrons left Ohio for Los Angeles; it was there that Sean, largely thanks to his sister navigated through the tricky social terrain of his new high school.  He still had routines he had to follow; he often misread responses and had trouble understanding interactions.  In early 1979, the movie \\"Son-Rise,\\" based on the life of Raun Kauffman aired on television.  Sean instantly \\"recognized\\" himself in some of Raun's early behaviors; at the end of the movie he discloses that he is autistic and for the first time in his life had a heart-to-heart talk about autism and why he behaved the way he did.  Although the movie was overly maudlin and paled considerably next to the book, \\"Son-Rise,\\" the best thing about it was that it proved Sean a chance to speak for himself.<br /><br />The Barrons remained in California until 1984 when they moved across country to Manhattan.  Sean insisted on returning to Ohio because he felt he had to prove himself on his old home turf.  He graduated from college; worked in a nursing home and did more than just prove himself.  He soared like the proverbial falcon.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Fighting for Tony\\" along with this book.

It is a book that will evoke just about every strong emotion under the sun.<br /><br />The children featured in this book all suffer from varying degrees of Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, or CDD.  The children all reached normal developmental milestones within the first three years of their lives with the exception of one girl who began her downward developmental spiral at two.  The penultimate child featured in this book was described as being developmentally delayed and did not appear to suffer from CDD so much as developmental delays.  Two children appeared to have some form of psychosis.  One child benefitted greatly from the anti-psychotic Largactil.  The child's mother insisted on having a prescribed anti-psychotic agent for her child.  Risperidol failed whereas Largactil allowed the child to function at close to age appropriate levels.<br /><br />Whether or not these two children suffered from psychosis is a matter of conjecture; the bizarre ideation and equally bizarre verbalizations and seemingly disorganized thinking and inability to make contact in meaningful ways with others suggested this as a possibility.  Sadly, many people with autism have been misdiagnosed with psychosis, so it is strongly urged not to jump to that conclusion.  Many people with autism and not CDD often make utterances others find bizarre; in the case of people at the higher functioning end of the spectrum have provided the rationale for their statements, thus dispelling the question of psychosis.<br /><br />Autism, unlike psychosis is characterized by rigid thinking and is accompanied by craving for order.  People with autism tend to be highly organized, whether it is lining up like objects; sorting out objects by category or insisting that things be in a specific order.  People with autism are grounded in reality, but communication is impeded to varying degrees based upon the severity of the condition.<br /><br />CDD accompanied with autism is a very devastating form of autism in that the child loses acquired skills and often does not catch up.  In some cases, Landau-Kleffner Syndrome is at play which includes a form of epilepsy.  Theories have been expounded as to what, if any causal link exists between LKS and autism in children suffering from CDD.<br /><br />Most of the children featured in this book have traveled down the LKS treatment road.  LKS is given a 50% cure rate, so one can only hope the children in this book will make that recovery.  Although all made great strides, at the time of the book's publication, they were still in great need of support.<br /><br />Each chapter is written by a parent of a child suffering from CDD.  Actually, FAMILIES suffer from CDD as it affects every member.  The only thing I did not like was the heavy handed use of the word perseverate.  That cost this book one star.  The parent of one child said that highly damning word \\"was once again part of our vocabulary.\\"  In truth, it is a highly negative and destructive word that has hurt many and is best avoided.  \\"Repetitive verbalizations / repetitive behaviors\\" and, in the case of topic repetition, \\"special interests\\" or \\"intense focus/concentration\\" are far better replacements; are more accurate and speak to tolerance whereas that other word simply does not.<br /><br />Every personal account in this book is quite interesting; enlightening and thought provoking.  The hopeful note remains throughout the book and there are some funny moments, such as when one child refused to don his \\"beetle\\" constume and dance with his fellow \\"beetles.\\"  One can't help but smile and wonder if perhaps he was receiving some cultural exposure to the Beatles and a spoof of the Beatles.<br /><br />No doubt people will find some solace in that they are not alone; other families have and are still coping with this devastating condition.  Optimism still abounds; one child, atwin with an especially severe form of CDD was enrolled in what sounded like an optimal school program where his needs were being met.  Another child was followed in a diary format and one can pinpoint to the day when his transformation took place.  This in turn is helpful to others so as to be hyperalert as to what to watch for.<br /><br />Different approaches were used with the children from Lovaas' time tested behaviorist methods to holistic/natural alternatives.  Education and hospitalization were included; knowing what resources were available in Australia and New Zealand was invaluable information.<br /><br />This book seemed to serve a two-fold purpose:  1) it provided information and personal accounts of CDD and 2) it reassured families that they are not alone in coping with witnessing this devastating developmental descent in children who suffer from CDD.what sounded like an optimal school program where his needs were being met.

However, even as an infant he did exhibit overtly autistic behaviors.<br /><br />His sister Renee was born a year and a half later in August of 1979.  Tony, still nonverbal was by then enrolled in a special needs pre-school program.  He and Renee plainly bonded from the start and, upon returning from pre-school, Tony bestowed his sister with a spontaneous kiss.<br /><br />Problems with behavior management arose; Rich and Mary Callahan eventually separated for two years.  A chance viewing of the now defunct Phil Donahue show in 1980 led Mary Callahan to believe that Tony's problems were allergy based.  It was during this time that Tony was taken off certain substances, milk included.  While he showed improvements, milk was then not targeted as the culprit.<br /><br />Reading of how Renee and Tony interacted was heartwarming; indeed, these siblings were quite good for one another.  Once milk was identified as causing Tony's problems, he was switched to a soy product.  From that point on, he showed no trace of autism, which led Mary Callahan, a nurse, to believe the boy had a cerebral allergy.<br /><br />Tony's shadows were kept at bay until a family trip in 1983.  He had two cartons of milk in his class, which led to a sad backslide into autism.  Once he had a chance to sleep it off, literally, he showed absolutely no trace of autism.<br /><br />Renee and Tony were kept in the same grade because of Tony's auditory processing difficulties.  This turned out to be a good move because they looked out for one another and worked well together.  In fact, they worked so well together they staged a coup at a day care center!  That was so funny!  I just loved that part!<br /><br />It would be interesting to hear an update on Tony's continued progress and of Renee's work in a special needs center.  It sounds as if Renee had on-the-job training the first few years of her life.  This in turn, no doubt, I believe, made her more effective in her line of work.<br /><br />I recommend \\"There's a Boy in Here\\" by Judy & Sean Barron along with this book.  Sean, like Tony had autism and both young men were blessed with younger sisters who were extraordinary teachers who loved them unconditionally.her line of work.

The girls, born in November of 1952 have two younger siblings.<br /><br />In 1963, Pamela has her first psychotic break.  When her 6th grade class is interrupted with a special bulletin from their principal about the assassination of President Kennedy, she is convinced she killed him.  She believed that had she \\"not let the President go to Dallas, then he would never have been killed.\\"  This bizarre idea stays with her for several years.<br /><br />Somehow, Pamela manages to get through public school.  Problems arose when she broke her leg on a skiing trip in early 1964; by 1965 she stopped grooming herself and often wore dirty clothes for days.  Carolyn was understandably upset with this and beseeched her sister to take more of an interest in herself.  Carolyn told her sister that if she failed to groom properly, people might mistake her for Carolyn.<br /><br />1965 was a turning point for the girls.  For the first time, they spent their summer apart.  Carolyn attended camp and Pamela begged off going.  The following year, Pamela attended an art camp and had some minor breakdowns that she was able to keep under cover.  She also began verbalizing bizarre ideations and her thinking was becoming markedly disordered/disorganized.<br /><br />In 1970, the girls graduated from high school.  By January 1971, Pamela's condition can no longer be kept secret.  She had a severe breakdown and was subsequently hospitalized.  The next 3 decades of her life were a litany of commitments to hospitals; unsatisfactory treatment and therapists who were poorly matched to meet her needs.<br /><br />Carolyn married in December of 1981, had her daughter in 1983 and son in 1987.  Ironically, she became a therapist.  Sadly, she and Pamela went for years without contact; in another twist of irony, it was when Carolyn was working in a psychiatric hospital that she heard from and about her sister in years.  Pamela was at that time in another psychiatric hospital in a secure unit.<br /><br />In time, Pamela's medications were adjusted, but she still had the occasional relapse.  The sisters came together to write the book.<br /><br />What makes this book so fascinating is that it is about identical twins, one of whom develops a severe form of a devastating mental illness.  Since the sisters have an identical genetic baseline, it is interesting that one and not both sisters develop a mental illness.at time in another psychiatric hospital in a secure unit.

It provides interesting information about people involved with the Beatles.<br /><br />However, it is racked with glaring errors that are EMBARRASSING!  The worst ones are as follows:<br /><br />1.  George and Louise are listed as parents of the Harrison children.  NOT TRUE!  Harold and Louise were the senior Harrisons.  George, the father of his own siblings?  I DON'T THINK SO!<br /><br />2.  George's year of birth was given as 1944 when he was born in 1943.  His brother Peter's year of birth was given as 1943 when he was born in 1940!<br /><br />There is just no excuse for this kind of sloppy reporting.

In fact, Marohn's book PREDATES Kirby's work!  So does autism pioneer Dr. Rimland, who has long beseeched those powers that be to look into this possible tie-in.<br /><br />Many publications including \\"Rolling Stone,\\" \\"Time\\" as well as many national newspapers and magazines have run articles about mercury and autism.  Many town meetings have been held in re mercury, thimerosal and autism.<br /><br />In recent years, studies have been conducted about determining that link.  At present, there does appear to be a strong positive correlation between mercury and autism.  A recent study that has been conducted in Boston has determined that blood among people with autism is different from that of neurotypical (NT) counterparts.  Lead and mercury has been found in large amounts in the hair and blood of people with autism.  Marohn talks about this in her book and about chelation treatment which is used to correct this.<br /><br />On May 6, 2005 an article in the local paper reported how a study in Boston has determined that there is a difference in immune systems in the autistic and neurotypical (NT) populations.  People with autism were shown to have 20% more immune cells and over 100 blood proteins also showed differences.  Dr. David Amaral of UC-Davis said that the brains of people with autism show an increase in B-cells and natural killer cells.  According to him, this indicates an autoimmune condition.  At the time of this review, it is too early to prove that the Boston and California studies are conclusive.  Amaral and his team have said they are on the cutting edge of bioresearch and detecting neuromarkers in autism.  They also feel there is a causal relationship between mercury in autism.<br /><br />In India and Indonesia, there has been an increase in autism.  Recent studies have shown large amounts of lead and arsenic in people's hair and blood.  That does not sound coincidental at all.  Changes in the environment, such as increased traffic; air pollutants and the vaccinations are at the top of the short list of possible causes.<br /><br />It is shocking and upsetting that people were told that meetings about the pharmaceutical companies' role in this are to be \\"kept confidential.\\"  I don't see how it CAN be a confidential matter with the number of people with autism are increasing!  Robert Kennedy, Jr., who is an environmental lawyer and former disc jockey-now TV talk host Don Imus have joined forces to confront pharmaceutical companies about whether or not there IS a causal link between mercury-thimerosal and autism.  Kennedy, long an environmentalist has banged on the drum for years about cleaning the PCBs and mercury out of New York's famous Hudson River because fish were ingesting these substances.  People in turn were eating the fish.  The entire food chain was being adversely affected by this.<br /><br />Kirby has appeared on Imus' talk show as well as others.  On August 7, 2005 he was interviewed by Tim Russert and he, together with RFK, Jr. cited their sources.  Kirby said that in the 1980s, one in every 10,000 children had autism; those figures have jumped in the last 20 years to 1 in every 2500.  SCARY!<br /><br />Thimerosal is no longer used in the state of California.  Autism has SIGNIFICANTLY DROPPED in the state of California.  Coincidence?  I DON'T THINK SO!  Nearly half of the thimerosal preservative for vaccinations is mercury!  The EPA has determined in very recent years that children who have received vaccinations in recent years have received far in excess of the legal safety limit.  The Environmental Protection Agency is aware of this and RFK, Jr. is actively involved with this organization as well.  Too bad there doesn't yet exist a bumper sticker that says \\"I'm/We're autistic and I/We vote!\\"<br /><br />A September 2003 article in \\"Newsweek\\" discusses the rise in autism including a family with three sons, two of whom have autism.  The parents claim that the two sons developed normally until they were vaccinated.  This article predates this book and Kirby's findings!<br /><br />Many presses seem reluctant to touch this very serious issue as well as acknowledge the recent studies and reports.  The sad thing is, as Imus pointed out, there seems to be a real fear of reprisal from the pharmaceutical companies.  Kirby has said repeatedly that the cruelest irony of all is that the very people who depend on those pharmaceutical companies and who have entrusted their children's health to those companies are the ones now paying the piper with the rise in autism.<br /><br />It's long past time this information was made available to the world at large and hopefully class action suits will be brought against the pharamaceutical companies.  Sadly, the laws seem more angled towards protecting the pharamaceutical companies than providing protection for people with autism and seeing that preventive measures are conducted to ensure that substances that cause autism are being used.  The 3-year Statute of Limitations is calculated to protect those pharmaceutical companies instead of placing the rights, interests and needs for those directly affected first.  WHY?  Special interests have indeed obstructed the legal vision of justice and all at the citizen taxpayers' cost.  People with autism deserve the same rights and protection.  There are many adults with autism who are taxpaying voters.  Their rights, interests and needs are also covered under the same legal umbrella that the NT world has benefitted/profitted from.  There has to be a way to stop letting the Federal Government to act as enablers to the pharmaceutical corporations by contining to pass the buck of autism onto the taxpayers while ensuring the pharmaceutical industry reaps the billions in profits.<br /><br />Autism is a serious matter.  A very serious matter.  It is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and processing as well as communication.  It can range from very severe, such as Kanner's autism and there are many people with Kanner's autism who are nonverbal and unable to live independently.  Care and provisions have to be made for their needs.  This is all currently being done at the taxpayers' expense.<br /><br />Since the pharmaceutical companies are concerned with profits, just think of the money they will save in providing lifetime services to people with severe forms autism if such a link can be proved, prevented and corrected.  Think of the money that is needed to maintain good support services and intervention programs for people with autism of all ages.  It would be in the pharmaceutical companies' monetary interest to look into this since money seems to be their main concern.<br /><br />There are many people with autism that is moderate to mild, such as Asperger's.  It is the adult population with Asperger's (people with autism who got off easy) who vote; pay taxes; marry; own property and are actively involved in these investigations.  It is the adult population with Asperger's who, working alongside NT counterparts are banging on the drum about this and trying to force the government/pharmaceutical hand to do something about this.

The beautiful archival photographs will certainly delight all readers as well as the memorabilia.  Readers will certainly get a feel for early-1960s Liverpool (1960-62) and the environment in which the Beatles flourished.<br /><br />Thanks to this book, fans can actually see the club where the Beatles' fame was soon launched.  The world's number one band cut their musical teeth in the Casbah, owned and run by drummer Pete Best's mother, Mona Best.  The club opened in 1959 when the Quarrymen-Silver Beatles were coming into their own.  This underground rock club was the precursor to its American counterparts such as the Hard Rock Cafe and the Fillmore East and Fillmore West, to name three.<br /><br />This fresh perspective of Beatle history includes Mona Best's story as well as other members of the Best family.  Pete Best, the Beatles' first drummer was unceremoniously ousted from the band in August of 1962.  Ringo Starr replaced him and the rest is, well, history.  Fans will undoubtedly feel as if they are watching the Beatles evolve from relative local obscurity into the musical juggernaut they became and remain to this day.	2005-08-10

Their works including this one by Robinson are for the birds.  That term came from birds pecking seeds which horses passed in their manure.  The expression \\"for the birds\\" means of minimal value and from a very questionable source.<br /><br />As much as I love reading books about people with autism, this one upset me greatly.  I just cringed at the parts where Grant was held forcibly; struck, tied to chairs and given inappropriate medications.  Talk about abuse!<br /><br />What upset me the most was the total disregard for the boy's feelings and the tired old misperception that people with autism don't feel.  That is a steaming crock of horse manure.  Feeling is what autism is all about!  Suggesting otherwise is not only cruel, it is a blatant fallacy.<br /><br />Another upsetting part was when Grant made efforts to communicate his wishes and needs and was completely disregarded.  I am so sick of people expecting those on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum to make ALL the social concessions to appease the NT world!  Whatever happened to meeting one another halfway?  The brutality described in this book sounds like something straight out of a \\"How to Exacerbate Autism\\" to me.<br /><br />As a survivor of enforced hugging, which I absolutely detest and cannot in good conscience support, the parts where Grant's mother forces him to endure punitive and restrictive hugs with NO regard for HIS needs made me wince.  It was for HER and not for her child!  Speaking from experience, it is terrifying; painful; upsetting and shows a COMPLETE disregard for the one being subjected to this treatment.  How cruel to take what is purportedly a loving gesture and convert it into something punitive and dreadful!<br /><br />I knew a child with autism who hated hugs and ran from a relative who was notorious for swooping down on children with raucous displays of affection.  From the child's perspective, the hugger appeared to be an attacker.  From where that child stood, it can be extremely frightening to have somebody rushing and lungeing at you.  Donna Williams, author of \\"Autism: An Inside Out Approach\\" does a stellar job of addressing the very real problem of enforced hugging.  Indeed, Grant's older brother tries to get through to their mother that these punitive hugs are not in Grant's interests at all.  He even spoonfed her a taste of her own bitter medicine, but even that failed to register.  I was just disgusted with the way the mother subjected Grant to this treatment, knowing full well it was traumatic for him when it was just an emotional elixir for HER needs only.<br /><br />Deep pressure relaxation is one thing.  The best approach is to allow the person with autism to decide when to apply some soothing deep pressure massages.  Since autism is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and processing, it seems very stupid and counterproductive to expect people on the a/A spectrum to do a sensory about face when confronted with unpleasant and even painful stimuli.  Letting the person with autism make the decision as to when to have this done is key; force does not work nor does it engender love.  It can, in some cases sour people on hugs.<br /><br />Books such as the Tinbergens' smug treatises on autism; the \\"Hug Therapy\\" books and Allen's \\"Holding Therapy\\" make me want to run for cover.  The fallacy these books reinforce is that by continuing to enforce people to endure hugs, they will enventually cave in and like them.  Not true.  Donna Williams in \\"Autism: An Inside Out Approach\\" says this \\"emotional rape\\" just teaches the person with autism to \\"give the desired response\\" so as to be released from this.  It just teaches forced submission.<br /><br />I am sorry, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this book and haveused it as an example of what NOT to do and how NOT to treat anybody.  This is one of the worst books I have ever read to date on this subject.  Please, please, do not, repeat, DO NOT subject people to this form of treatment.  This book is just a manifesto of self-serving cruelty.  Too bad there does not yet exist a bumper sticker that reads, \\"Have you NOT hugged your autistic child / parent/sibling / friend / spouse / partner today?\\"<br /><br />I think Grant was a casualty of the \\"treatments\\" (sounded more like abuses to me) that he was forced to endure.

I have had the good fortune to know two music therapists and have watched them work.<br /><br />Kevin developed normally for the first nearly 3 years of his life. He suffered from earaches as a toddler and his language was severely delayed. His social difficulties were first noticed in his aggression with peers as a pre-schooler. His younger sister Megan was the only child with whom he had a mostly good relationship.<br /><br />Kevin was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome when he was six. Facial twitching; grimaces; involuntary swearing and bizarre comments and generally poor language skills were behaviors that were present. Kevin's parents divorced when he was a young child. He became more violent, erratic and out of control. At 10, he was hospitalized for three years. Still in need of a secure facility, Kevin spent several more years in state facilities. His father resumes custody of Kevin when the boy was 15.<br /><br />By that point, Kevin, medicated since the age of six to control violent behavior and Tourette-related outbursts had started running away. The boy's mother then resumed custody, but Kevin's problems continued. He was enrolled in special programs in high schools in his district; he rebelled as he chafed at the stigma of these educational placements. After years of fearing Kevin's violence and history of running away, the boy's mother has him placed in group homes.<br /><br />Once in the group homes, Kevin literally steps up his running away. An inveterate soda addict, he goes on soda binges, even taking soda from other residents. Since the sugar jolt has adverse effects on his behavior, he is gradually weaned off of soda. That was the first of many giant steps he takes.<br /><br />Luckily for Kevin, music therapy was included in the group home program. He responded immediately and everyone was soon singing the praises of the music therapists and music therapy in general. Kevin also became involved in his community, taking on several part-time jobs and even received an award for volunteering at an animal shelter.<br /><br />From the telling, Kevin will continue to need care and supervision. Hope abounds as he makes progress in socializing with the other residents and by making music his forte.

Asperger's Syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum is a sensory and neurobiological condition that affects communication, sensory integration and processing. People on the spectrum are affected in varying degrees.<br />Despite the few typos and errors in names, this is an excellent book. Lise Pyles takes readers on a Magical Mystery Tour of Asperger's as experienced by her older son, John. Born in 1984 when a dearth of literature on Asperger's existed, John showed signs of it from infancy. He loved visual stimulation and playing with lights; insisted on having his legs covered; insisted on wearing only soft clothing and hated loud noises. One delightful anecdote was when John, then a pre-schooler looked at an iron with fear asking if it would make a noise. It seemed perfectly natural to find loud noises aversive stimuli.<br />John found school overwhelming due to his sensory sensitivies. He was forced to leave 4 preschools and found kindergarten and the early grades nightmarish. Since he had trouble navigating the social territory with peers, he was an easy mark for bullies. His rich experiences in living in 3 continents (U.S., Europe [England] and Australia) provided him with enrichments that many people have never known.<br />March 4, 1992 was a banner day for John. That was the day he began his homeschool program which continued until the 1994-95 school year. John was also taken off Ritalin, which he hated. From 1988-1992 John was on the drug which made him easier for his teachers. The downsides to the drug was that it caused sleep wetting and migraines as well as added stigma. Once off and once homeschooled and provided with helpful cues from his younger brother, Jay, John was well on his way.<br />John had special interests which is part of Asperger's Syndrome. Luckily he was allowed to pursue his special interests which segued into real talents and developed skills. He had a myriad of interests over time and became a good source of interesting information.<br />I like the way this book includes practical suggestions; each chapter contains a list of approaches to take with a child who is on the spectrum. There is also a list of organizations which is provided at the end of the book which will undoubtedly prove invaluable to many people seeking guidance.<br />This book makes me think of the 1967 Beatles' classic, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; because readers take that magical mystery tour through Asperger's with two very proficient guides - John and John's mother, the author of this book. &quot;Roll up for the mystery tour!

Be sure to get the entire two-volume set.  You not only get songs the Beatles wrote, but also their versions of covers they did such as \\"Kansas City.\\"  The sheet music is clear and quite easy to follow, which makes learning the songs easier.

For those who are \\"multi-lingual\\" musically, chords, notes and tabulature is provided.  That way everybody who can read at least one form of music can really put this book to good use.  I am also delighted that the lyrics are included.  That way, people who either don't know all the words or who want to learn them can sing along.<br /><br />Another excellent feature is that the instrumental sections of the songs are included.  This book is a must have.  Be sure to check out the Beatles' Complete Scores and the finger pickin' guitar book of Beatle songs as well.  However, of the choices presented, this book is your first choice.<br /><br />Guitar players, make this book your best friend when you want to play and/or learn to play Beatle songs the Beatle way.

This is a brilliant work about being in an intimate relationship with a person who has Asperger's Syndrome (AS).  AS is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing/integration and is on the autism spectrum.  It also affects communication.<br /><br />Many people on the a/A spectrum don't care for hugs and find them intrusive and just endure them to appease others.  For many people with AS, hugs can be a sensory onslaught that can include an aversion for the feel of scratchy beards; perfume or body odor; the feel of the hugger's clothing and the feel of being enclosed in a seemingly \\"restrictive\\" fashion.  Many children on the a/A spectrum dislike loud displays of affection.  For neurotypical (NT) counterparts, the natural response when confronted with an adverse response to hugs is to draw the erroneous conclusion that people on the a/A spectrum are devoid of affection.<br /><br />The book takes its title from the Beatle coiffed character Mr. Spock of \\"Star Trek\\" fame.  The title character, Mr. Spock is clinical, analytical and seemingly devoid of emotion.  Sadly, a misperception that people with AS lack emotion still exists.  The term \\"Mr. Spock,\\" when applied to persons on the a/A spectrum was humorous.  People with AS often have a novel way of making assessments and that can be found in the following example.  I knew a Beatle fan, a young boy with AS who said of Mr. Spock, \\"He has a Beatle haircut and so do I.  He's like me because of that and because he can figure things out.  I read that the guy who made Mr. Spock up likes the Beatles.\\"  I like his reasoning.<br /><br />Since AS is a sensory condition, feeling is what underscores a/A (autism/Asperger's) behavior and responses.  Meeting the needs of all involved, the NT and the person on the a/A spectrum can be found in this book.  People on the spectrum have heightened sensory modes; sounds are amplified; odors are stronger; tastes are more pungent and tactile contact more intense.  The \\"Mr. Spock\\" syndrome comes into play because for many people on the spectrum, regulating emotions and \\"decoding\\" the facial expressions and responses of others is difficult.  \\"Coming even\\" after being bombarded with sensory stimuli often appears in a blunted affect which again reinforces the \\"Mr. Spock\\" syndrome.<br /><br />Still, this is an excellent book for adults on the spectrum and for those directly involved with them.

Sean, the boy with whom Cipolloni worked presented behavior that fit the category of Kanner's Autism.  I didn't like the way Cipolloni referred to autism as an emotional disturbance.  Many behaviors that appear to be rooted in emotional disturbance are more often than not coping mechanisms people with autism have taken on to desensitize themselves to overwhelming stimuli.  Autism includes sensory integration and processing difficulties and for those on the spectrum who are either nonverbal or whose speech is severely delayed, responding to stimuli and communicating often is expressed in behavior that is puzzling to others.<br /><br />I didn't like the way Cipolloni blamed Sean's parents and started that tired old \\"blame the child's mother\\" routine.  The long antiquated fortress metaphor is a judgmental and inaccurate portrayal of autism.  There are many who subscribe to the school of thought that the sensory and communication difficulties are what preclude many with severe autism from communicating in ways the neurotypical world can understand.  Suggesting that this is a \\"choice\\" and that the child with autism \\"kept others out\\" by building such an emotional fortress was something he wanted to do is doing a grave disservice to all.  I would have thought that by the time this book was published, greater strides would have been made.  Suggesting that anybody would cause their child to be autistic is not only preposterous, it is a downright fallacy.  Living with autism is a major challenge, so the suggestion that anybody would cause this is just plain ludicrous.<br /><br />I also didn't like the way Cipolloni dismissed scientific research and evidence that has proven time and again that autism is a sensory-neurobiological condition.  At no time does he acknowledge pioneers who have shared first hand accounts of living with autism, such as Donna Williams; James Williams; Raun Kaufman; Kenneth Hall; Luke Jackson; Temple Grandin; Georgiana Thomas;  Ben Levinson; Sean Barron; Elijah Paradiz and John Pyle, whose mother wrote about his life with Asperger's to name a few.<br /><br />Cipolloni is highly judgmental and condemnatory in writing of Sean's parents and the way they interacted with their child.  The book is rife with Bettelhemian fallacies such as blame the parents; the empty fortress and other tired cliches that have proven to be untrue.  Plainly Cipolloni does not have all the answers; the boy remains severely autistic throughout the book and at no time does Cipolloni offer any reasonable sounding approach in working with and understanding autistic behavior.<br /><br />In reading this book, one gets the feeling that Cipolloni is eager to blame the child's parents for his autism.  His own attitudes are negative and judgmental and he offers no room for them to defend themselves or to encourage them to feel that they are working on their child's behalf.<br /><br />The other thing that bothered me was Cipolloni's obvious view of himself as \\"saving\\" Sean and the other children with whom he works.  Save him from what?  Autism presents its major challenges, but it does NOT diminish a person nor can Cipolloni re-make and mold Sean into something he is not.  To suggest otherwise is not only cruel, but unfair and unrealistic.  Since Cipolloni closes by saying he does not see any of his young clients and has not for years, one wonders if he feels he has truly helped them.; Luke Jackson; Temple Grandin; Georgiana Thomas;  Ben Levinson; Sean Barron; Elijah Paradiz and John Pyle, whose mother wrote about his life with Asperger's to name a few.

Anne and her twin brother, Peter, born in 1954 become part of a large family.  Sadly, their mother dies in 1957 and Anne has trouble navigating in the hearing world.  Unable to remain in preschool because of her hyperactive behavior and inability to hear directions, her father, stepmother and paternal grandparents are ill-equipped to meet her needs.<br /><br />Misdiagnosed as retarded in October 1959 at Johns Hopkins, Anne then serves a five-year sentence at the Stoutamyre School.  The \\"school\\" sounds like a medieval torture chamber; the children are not educated in academics nor taught self-care.  Margie Stoutamyre, the school's director made, in the words of Anne's co-author, Adair N. Renning, Nurse Wretched Ratched of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" infamy look like Mary Poppins.  Dickensian workhouses pale in comparison to this place.<br /><br />Children were beaten by Margie at the drop of a hat; if one so much as looked at someone else being beaten, they, too received a beating.  Belts, whips and a board with holes were used; children could only use the bathroom three times a day and even then Margie allotted them a certain amount of time which she monitored with a stopwatch.  Illnesses did not exempt one from beatings.  In one memorable passage, Anne was forced to eat another child's vomit simply because she saw him vomit at the table.<br /><br />In addition to the beatings, children were locked in the root cellar for days; kept in a windowless seclusion room and even strapped to a chair.  Anne Bolander literally survived in hell.  Mealtimes were rigid affairs where one had to eat in a certain way and keep a straight spine at all times.  Failure to do so resulted in beatings.  Anne describes how some children were literally beaten to death and she even recounts how she saw a boy being pounded to death simply because he had diarrhea.<br /><br />Her grandmother was the only person who was kind to her.  In 1964 she takes Anne out of Stoutamyre for a few days to enjoy the World's Fair.  By 1965 Anne's father and stepmother have her discharged.  Anne, in her words has exchanged one Margie for another.  Pat, her stepmother treated her in the same brutal and erratic fashion that Margie did.  The only girl in a houseful of brothers, Anne concluded that being male was the way to survive and that \\"love\\" meant \\"being beaten\\" because she had been told by Pat how much Margie \\"loved\\" her.<br /><br />The one bright spot in her life during that period was the 1965-1966 school year she spent at St. Mary's.  Kind, loving nuns nurtured her and helped heal much of the harm that had been inflicted upon her.  Sadly, she is forced to leave the place because her father has been transferred to another state.<br /><br />Anne's secondary and adult years are marked by social unawareness.  She is easily mislead by those who are not well meaning and this pattern of gullible trusting follows her into the workplace.  She thinks the nickname \\"Retard\\" is an honor because she wanted a nickname \\"like the other kids,\\" not realizing the stigma attached.  She steals gifts so as to gain popularity and is willing to do anything to have people like her.  While understandable, the results are no less devastating.<br /><br />Anne graduates from high school in 1974 at the age of 20.  She spends a summer in a hospital training program at a college in N.Y., but finds that the adjustment was more than she was then able to make.  Anne exceeds her father's low expectations of her by not only graduating, but buying her own car and paying for the insurance herself after taking driving lessons.  She spends the next number of years living in her own mobile home and with friends, some of whom use her.<br /><br />Luckily, Anne meets angels, such as Ruth and Glenn, who help her navigate tricky social terrain.  Ruth encourages her to fix herself up; Glenn tells her what certain obscenities mean so she will no longer fall prey to the rude and mean spirited jokes her co-workers play.  In time, Anne learns these things.<br /><br />Setbacks occur, such as when Anne is raped by her father in 1979.  She spends December of 1980 in a hospital, sorting out the problems in her life, starting with Stoutamyre.  By the time she is released in early 1981, Anne is ready to put her life together.  She moves out of one bad household where she was being monetarily exploited; becomes active in the deaf community and reconnects with her youngest brother.  In March of 1984, her father remarries and Anne has by then realized that with the exception of her youngest brother, she has to cut her losses where her family is concerned.  The final blow was when her father and stepmother argued over her brother's surgery when her father said he was not going to spend any money on his son as he was no longer a child.<br /><br />A hard, intense and much needed book, Anne is the voice of inspiration.  She has survived in hell and, like the phoenix risen up out of the ashes.

About Time!	This is a book that everybody needs.  A good portion of Mr. Kirby's thesis is that pharamceutical companies continue manufacturing drugs that have caused harm.  The bottom line is dollars and cents as opposed to common sense.<br /><br />People who were born prior to 1988 have most likely been subjected to mercury in other medications, as well as tuna.  Again, that possible causal link.  Robert Kennedy Jr., a long established environmentalist has worked tirelessly to clean the Hudson River as contaminants that fish ingest also affect people who eat those fish.  Many articles and current studies and examples and accounts are showing a high incidence of autism after repeated ingestion of mercury.<br /><br />Kirby has found allies in the forms of Robert Kennedy, Jr. and former DJ, now morning TV-host, Don Imus.  Kennedy has appeared on talk shows, discussing the rise in autism in recent years, quoting this book.  According to him and other experts, the current statistics show that one in 166 children has autism whereas in 1960 one in 2,500 showed some form of autistic behavior.  California is one state that has discontinued the use of thimerosal in vaccines and the autism rate has dropped drastically.  That in and of itself supports the high positive correlation between autism and thimerosal, which contains mercury.  The question about mercury causing and/or exacerbating existing autism has also been brought to the forefront.<br /><br />Kennedy, Jr., like Imus challenged pharmaceutical companies in re thimerosal.  Their position is that thimerosal contributes nothing of a curative, preventive or preservative nature; therefore there is no need to include it in vaccines.  It has only been included in vaccinations since 1988.<br /><br />Many recent articles and documents citing cases have strongly supported Kirby's findings.  The FDA and the CDC cannot be counted on to present unbiased findings to the public nor can these giants be expected to act in the best interests of all.  Politics and money underscore these corporate behemoths and it is always at the cost of the individuals AND their children.  The children end up being sacrificial lambs in a manner of speaking because it is their very health, interests and quality of life that is being compromised at great expense.<br /><br />This empowering work includes lists of people who are part of the FDA and CDC including politicians who have received major contributions from huge pharmaceutical corporations.  That porkbarrel repast does not a healty balance make!<br /><br />While this book does not include more scientific components to back the claims stated herein, it is replete with many examples where it is so plain, so obvious and so clear-cut that the currently reported research and results have been slanted to favor the pharmaceutical giants.  The sad, cruel irony is that people have entrusted their very lives and those of their children to such organizations that purport to have everybody's collective health and best interests in mind.  Scary!  What is so frustrating is that studies that show what Kirby, Kennedy and others are coming forward with are NOT being made public and available.  That is why we need this book!<br /><br />Why on earth this information has not been made accessible to people, especially in the United States where the Freedom of Information Act exists is downright negligent.  The worst irony of all is that the very scientific organizations who claim to be reputable researchers have worked to alter the data and keep their findings from the world at large.  That is acting at cross purposes with everybody!  That is disgraceful!<br /><br />While California has taken a giant step forward by eliminating thimerosal from vaccines, hope springs eternal that thimerosal will no longer be used.  In recent months, TV-host Don Imus has banged on the drum about autism and said that since he doesn't have to answer to any pharmaceutical companies, he's going to say whateverhe wants about finding causes for autism.  Thanks to his tireless efforts, NBC newscaster Brian Williams has included segments about autism on his show throughout the summer of 2005.  The unending refrain in Imus' autism awareness talks is why on earth are so many people terrified of the pharmaceutical companies?!!  People who were born prior to 1988 have most likely been subjected to mercury in other medications, as well as tuna.  Again, that possible causal link.  His position has been that these companies take responsibility for conducting impartial research; making those findings accessible to the public and working on behalf of those they claim to be helping.<br /><br />After reading this book, one will certainly think there is indeed a causal link between autism and mercury.  Although this is not to say there is, evidence certainly leans in that direction.  Sadly, one sees how trust issues regarding the FDA and the CDC have been compromised.  Politics and corporate greed have infected the very agencies whom many have placed their trust regarding their health.<br /><br />This is a MUST READ for everybody.  It is an enlightening look at polictics; the health industry; autism and possible causes.

He backs each statement up with an appropriate illustration.  Caspian's mother adds more detail about autism, which is a sensory neurobiological condition affecting communication and sensory processing and integration.  Each page contains a sidebar with her input.<br /><br />This book makes me think of the Jimi Hendrix classic, \\"Are You Experienced?\\"  When you read this, you will feel you have gained a greater understanding of the autism experience.  If you are neurotypical, you will develop a greater understanding of what people with autism contend with and rationales for behavior that often accompany autism.<br /><br />All in all, a solid piece of work.  Make a place on the shelves and in your lives for this book.  A must read for all parents, educators and medical professionals.  This is for everbody!	2005-07-24

The collection is complete and will certainly help musicians re-create the Beatles' distinctive sound.  Different parts for other musical instruments are included as well as the vocals.  Tablature is also included.  This is a must have!<br /><br />Despite the complaints other reviews have made, I did not find that the print size was too small.  I also like the way the book showed which strings were being played on guitar for some of the chords for the music.<br /><br />Since NONE of the Beatles ever learned to read music, the inclusion of tabulature is most welcome.  Tabulature provides a \\"picture\\" of the guitar chord, the fret(s) and strings that are to be played.  It is an alternative method to reading music and is darned effective.  I can read music and I can read tabulature and am \\"bilingual\\" in that musical sense.  Providing both forms of musical language make this a much more inclusive work.<br /><br />If you want an outstanding, top notch book of Beatle songs with accuracy and good explanations, then you want this book.	2005-07-19

James, whose inspiring story is featured in &quot;Dancing in the Rain&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Falling Snow&quot; by Annabel Stehli offers further insights to having autism; coping with it and how families work together.<br />I was impressed with the way James explained how he developed an interest in learning to knit and how soothing he found this activity. He also developed an interest in the American Girls Series, bravely jumping the Gender Bias Barrier to emphasize how one group is usually treated as an underclass at the expense of another (or others).<br />I loved it when James addresses the very real problem of the word &quot;perseverate&quot; in any tense. He threw down the gauntlet on this harmful word in &quot;The Sound of Snow Falling.&quot; It is truly a damning, judgmental, negative and destructive word that is best avoided. &quot;Repetitive behavior / verbalizations&quot; is a preferable replacement and certainly shows more tolerance and is far more accurate. James rightfully points out that overtly autistic behaviors such as lining up items could be the precursor to a talent in draftsmanship and architechture and mathematics. Each &quot;special interest,&quot; by far a more tolerant and accurate term than the harmful &quot;perseverate&quot; ever was, can segue into a rewarding interest and possibly career. James speaks to hope and potential and his story is a strong beacon of hope.<br />James does an exemplary job of explaining how confusing the Tacit Social Codes &amp; Rules are. For many people on the autism/Asperger (a/A) spectrum, the rules seem to change on a whim, based on the needs of the neurotypical (NT) population.<br />What a wonderful bridge, a link, a meeting point for the a/A population and the NT population to meet each other half way and go the extra mile. This book truly deserves a place of honor and is for everybody.for everybody.	2005-07-09

I laughed so hard I wiped tears of laughter out of my eyes. One thing I caught was that although the story was set in 2000, the date &#34;Saturday, November 21&#34; was given and November 21 was a Saturday in 1998!<br />Wallace Wallace, the unfortunately one-named 8th-grade protagonist lives by the &#34;honesty is the best policy&#34; credo. Some of his honest observations, while insulting to the recipients are hilariously articulate. For example, he tells a neighbor that her &#34;light fluffy cake&#34; tastes like &#34;vacuum cleaner lint&#34; and the icing reminds him of antifreeze. His cousin's clarinet playing sounds like &#34;somebody strangling a duck.&#34; That was just TOO funny!<br /><br />So are his observations of the maudlin story about Old Shep, a story about the death of a German shepherd. Wallace tells his English teacher (and later play director) that he dislikes the story and that &#34;any book with an award medal on it and a picture of a dog&#34; always has a canine casualty. He and his classmates list several books, including &#34;Sounder&#34; and &#34;Old Yeller.&#34; Point made, Wallace is in the dog house with his English teacher. He has to serve detention, which means he cannot participate on the football team.<br />All right, Wallace grimly accepts that punishment. To cap it off, he has to attend rehearsals of the play &#34;Old Shep&#34; and write a review of the book. His review is scathingly honest and in true Wallace Wallace form, a riot. I laughed so hard at his reviews and observations!<br />Once committed to the play, Wallace makes many valid suggestions to make it more palatable and plausible. He insists on doing away with the stilted, somewhat implausible lines; he points out details that he feels a modern audience won't buy. His revisions include opening the play with witnessing a toy dog being run over by a motorcycle (a moped for safety's sake), rollerbladers; a punchy garage band and a believable, updated script. Even his nemesis, the redoubtable Mr. F., the English teacher/play director is reluctantly captivated by Wallace's progressive thinking. The clincher was when several boys, members of a garage band called the Dead Mangoes implore Mr. F. to play with them. Mr. F. and the boys, including the Beatle coiffed Myron &#34;The Void&#34; Muckenfusser have a rollicking good time jamming and getting some fun catchy tunes ready for the play. Beatle themes are subtly included, such as the description of Wallace's former best friend's hair as a Moptop and Myron's Beatle inspired locks. I loved that!<br /><br />Despite the fun, someone is trying to sabatoge the play. Wallace is at the top of everybody's short list, but is he really the one? There are actually other suspects and the list grows until the smash finale prior to the final curtain.<br /><br />This book is a keeper!updated script.

This one is not the riveting read or the trashy \\"good for a long plane trip\\" that some of her others were.  This didn't even serve the purpose of being a bad book that was simply a way to fill time like some of her others -- it was just plain bad.  This was the kind of book you could put down for a week and pick up at will.<br /><br />Her main character is Jess, a strident prosecutor who is also an inane whinebag.  She has some grounds for going from whinebag to strident screamer - her client disappears just prior to a major trial.  Her client is facing down a rapist in court and is expected to testify against him.  Her former husband defends the rapist and adds fuel to Jess' fire.<br /><br />Jess is just such an unpleasant character who was impossible to like.  She acted a fool with her brother-in-law, Barry.  She would hound and bait him and provoke him mercilessly.  She acted like a child around him.  She hounded and harassed her older sister, Maureen, who tabled a legal career to raise her young son and infant girl twins.  She also acted a fool with her father and his new family.  She just wasn't family friendly.<br /><br />Just about when everybody's collective nerves have suffered from Jess, she meets a shoe salesclerk and starts a relationship.  This is a step up from her inordinate attachment to her bird.  Naturally, we have to have a little mystery going, so the main mystery, aside from why would anybody endure Jess if they didn't have to is where the heck is her missing mother?  The woman has been missing in action for 8 years and Jess is high on her family's suspect list.  Prior to her mother's disappearance, she and Jess had a battle royal.  Jess was equal opportunity - she said vile, nasty things to anybody unlucky enough to cross her path.<br /><br />Jess is a tiresome whinebag who never evolves into a sympathetic character.  The ending was also a trite disappointment.  You feel let down after a big build up.  Yeah, this book will provide momentary diversion, but it is not up to Fielding's par.  \\"Grand Avenue\\" is her magnum opus and readers can hope she will write more books like \\"The First Time\\" and \\"Grand Avenue.\\"after a big build up.

It is good to get the voice of a man who has intimate, personal knowledge of a/A and explaining some of the sensory issues that accompany this neurobiological condition.  Since people on the a/A spectrum are expected to make concessions to the NT world just to get along socially, it is nice to have books like this that provide explanations of what people with autism contend with.

Ellen Tebbits is the only child of an overly fastidious mother who wants their home to look like a magazine layout.  She laments not having friends and being forced to wear one-piece winter woolen underwear during the cold season.<br /><br />Otis Spofford is her nemesis, a funny bully who loves nothing more than to play jokes on Ellen.  A big jokester, Otis' behavior seems more aimed at humor than malice.  Otis' mother runs a ballet class over the Payless Drugstore and Ellen is one of her pupils.<br /><br />Ellen finally gets her wish for a friend.  A husky, assertive girl named Austine moves into the neighborhood and the 3rd-graders are classmates.  Otis is also in their class.  They share similar interests, including walking past a garden with gnomes.  (Kind of makes you think of George Harrison and Friar Park).  The girls want to dress alike and even go so far as to pick out a fabric with red monkeys that they like.  Ellen's mother is a seamstress and makes a very nice dress; Austine's mother can't sew to save her life and poor Austine looks like she got her dress out of the Rag Bag.  This causes jealousy and a falling out.<br /><br />By the time the girls start fourth grade, Austine has snubbed Ellen until a chance to clear the air presents itself.  Although this book was written in 1951, it is a timeless classic.  The issues of friendship in the early grades and bullies and growing up have not changed.	2005-07-07

177147:US	49447323	R2M6CEELHGBS5E	0312199813	556115941	Get Back: The Unauthorized Chronicle of the Beatles' " Let It Be" Disaster	Books	5	9	15	N	N	Across the Universe	This is an excellent book that is well researched.  As an inveterate Beatles fan, I found it very interesting and was sorry to see a good thing come to an end.  I loved the glimpse behind the Beatle curtain during rehearsals and the details of each scene of the 1969 movie, \\"Let it Be.\\"  The movie was released in 1970 and has since been regarded as the end of an era.<br /><br />I was glad to see that there was no criticism of Yoko and I did not find her intrusive at all.  In fact, her original observations added to the appeal of this work!  Paul's family scenes with his wife Linda and daughter, Heather, then 6 lent a gentle touch to the movie.  Paul clearly was in his element with them and seeing him so loving and natural made a good thing even better.<br /><br />Over the years, Paul has been harshly criticized during this period.  Instead of refusing to allow the other Beatles room under the spotlight, Paul asked John repeatedly to bring in contributions so they can collaborate.  In watching the movie and reading this book, one is under the impression that John is reticent about working with Paul.  Since the Beatles allowed this film to be made of them in their natural state, dispensing blame is not only harsh, but counterproductive.  There is no way for anyone to know the motives and thoughts of the Beatles.  Speculation is one thing, but it does seem strange to declare those speculations as Gospel truth.<br /><br />In one well-known acrimonious exchange between George and Paul, George tells Paul that he'll \\"play [guitar] if Paul wants him to and he won't play if Paul does not want him to.\\"  Paul even said in the Beatles' \\"Anthology\\" that he was by nature a hard worker and he encouraged the other Beatles to work with him.  At no time did I ever come away with the impression that Paul was doing anything other than to create music as a group.<br /><br />The question of George's leaving is treated as a response to John.  The tapes that cover this period are missing in action, so there is really no way to prove this point either.  George has said over the years that it was friction with Paul that prompted his departure and this book does not address that fact at all.<br /><br />Paul was and remains a Class Act.  He is the ultimate entertainer, completely at home performing.  That is all to the good.  Paul has even said in more recent years that he was driven and is a workaholic.  Indeed, his dedication and hard work have proved successful as did the combination of his talents along with those of his bandmates.  Paul also has the ability to comport himself with dignity and aplomb which reflects well on him.  Even so, there probably have been times when Paul, in less than stellar moments made decisions and behaved in ways that upset others.  It is part of the human condition.  People are too complex to be confined to an image or set of consistent behaviors.<br /><br />Clearly, the underplayed Harrison-McCartney friction is addressed by George Harrison himself in reviewing this period.  He said he would never, under any conditions be in the same band with Paul McCartney, but he had no qualms about working with John Lennon.  Even in his autobiography, \\"I Me Mine,\\" Harrison barely mentions his former bandmates.<br /><br />Pointing fingers and saying one member is to blame and excusing another is neither accurate nor helpful.  Each Beatle directly involved, in this case Harrison, Lennon and McCartney have to take owership for his own actions.  Each one contributed in his own fashion to the strife and tension that was rippling through the group during this period.<br /><br />Each Beatle aimed darts at one or another; John's infamous dig at Paul was \\"How Do You Sleep;\\" Paul countered John with \\"Too Many People;\\" Ringo's dig at Paul was \\"Back Off, Boogaloo\\" and George's were \\"Wah-Wah\\" and his minimal mention of Lennon and McCartney in his autobiography.<br /><br />All in all, barring the subjective opinions, this is an excellent book thatwill provide rich detail about the Beatles' filming of \\"Let It Be\\" during January 2 - 31, 1969 and the wrapping up of the group.  You will also want to read the Beatles' \\"Anthology\\" and listen to bootlegs of the \\"Let it Be\\" period.

All aboard for the mystery tour!  Step right this way!  Take a Magical Mystery Tour into the sensory world of autism/Asperger's Syndrome!  And who better than somebody on the spectrum to act as a tour guide for the neurotypical population to understand autism!<br /><br />Tony Attwood is certainly one of the leading experts on Asperger's Syndrome.  This book is an interesting and easily absorbed collection of how several individual families interact with children on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) specrum.  Since these families had to sign consents to be included in the book, I somehow doubt they will find their input will come back to haunt them, although that is possible.  The people involved knew going in that their accounts would be included and hopefully, instead of feeling embarrassed about being at a certain point in childhood, the people featured in this book will see how they have moved far beyond that point and not be held accountable for previous times.<br /><br />I loved the accounts of how people on the a/A spectrum respond and what educational as well as socialization approaches each family used.<br /><br />The cartoon method in the chapter about humor and empathy are redolent of Carol Gray of her famous Social Stories - draw comic strips with appropriate captions to explain social exchanges.  I like the way the experts' work in some ways overlap and yet arrive at a reasonable explanation.  People on the a/A spectrum do not, repeat, do NOT lack the ability to empathize.  Rather, people on the a/A spectrum often have to be cognitively \\"taught\\" to perceive viewpoints from another person's stance.<br /><br />Having each child offer input in this book with the statement of trust makes for a very neurotypical (NT) and a/A friendly book.  The world is for everybody and not just the NT and this book does a stellar job of being as inclusive of all people.  Most people on the spectrum are keenly aware that they are \\"different\\" and want nothing more than to fit in and be indistinguishable.  The poignant pleas for acceptance and the explanations of a/A behaviors and sensory responses will certainly help propel the NT population further down the Long & Winding Road towards that Acceptance.<br /><br />No doubt people with Asperger's Syndrome will take this book to heart and learn a lot from it.  This is a book that is certainly worth reading and does a fine job of bridging the NT-a/A gap (\\"Sensory Gap\\").e poignant pleas for acceptance and the explanations of a/A behaviors and sensory responses will certainly help propel the NT population further down the Long & Winding Road towards that Acceptance.

Extensive coverage of the Beatles' 1964 appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show is given as well as the background of each Beatle.  The pre-Ringo years in Hamburg (1960-62) also receive fairly good coverage.  Although this book offers nothing new to inveterate fans, people just coming into the Beatles will undoubtedly find this book to be a good teaching tool.	2005-06-26

We Love You	I've said for the majority of my life that for any given occasion you can find appropriate Beatles' lyrics!  No doubt anybody who lucks into this book will enjoy it.  I love seeing candid pictures of the Beatles.  Any excuse to look at fab pictures of the Fabs taken by a Fab works for me!<br /><br />The Genesis edition was too expensive for most people, myself included.  I was beyond delighted when this became available.  Each Beatle on writing to other members in the band brought many smiles to many faces, including mine.  Readers got a sense of each Beatle and how he interacted with his fellow Fabs.  Paul, the family man included his kids in his closing signature.  That said a lot of good about Paul.  John had his inimitable style of writing, which is sure to bring some laughs your way.  George, with his clear, legible writing sent clear, direct missives.  George in paper and in person and on film did not vary - he was lovable, straightforward, droll, wry, clever George Harrison.  He also had a gift for natural expression.	2005-06-20

This is a Serious Read!	This book is an in-depth look at how the Beatles' arrival in America on February 7, 1964 (also known as Beatles Day) was generally met with great joy and rave reviews.  Arriving in the U.S. less than 3 months after President Kennedy was assassinated, the Beatles breathed new life and fresh fun into a grieving world.<br /><br />Stark examines Liverpool England, the Beatles' home town from a rather sociological standpoint.  While Ringo was the only Beatle who was raised by a single mother due to divorce, the premise of absentee fathers does not necessarily apply to the Beatles as a group.  On the other hand, the nod to \\"strong mothers\\" certainly applies to the Beatles, including John's mother Julia who had her sister and brother-in-law raise him and who also taught him to play stringed instruments.  John's maternal aunt Mimi was quite an indomitable lady indeed and John would say at different points throughout his life that the women in his family were very strong.  This would be revisited in each Beatle wife as each one was a strong woman in her own right.<br /><br />The Beatles did, through no design of their own encourage some gender-neutral, androgynous fun and fashion.  Their trademark Moptops are a rather unisex cut and added to their visual appeal.  The Beatles have indeed raised the musical and cultural bar and remain a timeless and permanent cultural fixture.  Their music and personal milestones had a strong influence on the 60s protest movements; e.g. lyrics and transcendental meditation in India in 1967.  Other groups of disenfranchised persons and the issues of the day are often tied directly to Beatle songs, e.g. 1968's \\"Revolution\\" and \\"Piggies\\" and 1966's Harrison gem, \\"Taxman.\\"<br /><br />Including trivia as well as long reported facts help round this book out and make it distinct.  Stark is a very astute man and his analyses of the Beatles' relationships with their spouses and each other provides much rich thought.  As for needing another book on the Beatles, as Stark asks in this book, the Beatles are a fascinating topic of conversation and having different input from more people proves once again that the group and the individuals who were part of that group can be discussed and intellectually explored from many different angles.  His inclusion of thoughts expressed by other Beatle experts supports this finding.sks in this book, the Beatles are a fascinating topic of conversation and having different input from more people proves once again that the group and the individuals who were part of that group can be discussed and intellectually explored from many different angles.

Duchenne's Muscular Dystophy (DMD), which is an X-linked trait runs rampant throughout her family.  DMD claimed several male relatives throughout the generations in her family.  Females are born carriers of this tragic condition and every male born in a family where this trait is present is at risk for developing it at some point in life.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed this book, there were two things that irked me: the constant references to sneakers and being Irish.  Even the tablecloth was made of Irish lace!  The O'Hagans' beagle was named Finney!  Sharing the traditions of Irish heritage was all well and good, but the constant references to being Irish did seem a bit excessive at points.  As for the sneakers, the symbol of mobility and childhood play and sports, the message could not have been made more plain.<br /><br />Christine's younger brother Richie Jr., born in 1957 showed signs of MDM early.  Poor coordination and balance and difficulty managing stairs were the tip-offs to his having MDM.  By 1966 Richie was no longer able to walk and remained confined to a wheelchair for the remainder of his life.  He died in July of 1979 at the age of 22.<br /><br />Some very touching anecdotes are shared; in 1961, Christine, then 11 would take her 4-year-old brother to the neighborhood church and pray for him.  That was really heartwarming.  I also liked it when the neighborhood boys took Richie under their wing and would hang off the back of his wheelchair, including him in their games.  I loved it when Richie would sing the Beatles' songs from 1967's \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" in 1967-68.  The Kehl children's Aunt Nelly's bizarrely quaint expressions involving hygiene and bathroom usage are sure to bring a smile; the unfamiliar term \\"kitty murphies\\" was made quite clear in the context and feline reference.<br /><br />Christine and younger sister Pam (born 1953) both had sons with DMD.  Christine's younger son, Jamie was diagnosed at age 7 on October 16, 1980.  He was tested in the hospital for DMD in December of 1980.  Her older son, born in August of 1971 did not inherit the condition.  Sadly, Jamie died on May 20, 1998 at the age of 24, one year after his maternal grandmother died.<br /><br />Pam's two sons, born in 1976 and 1977 also had DMD which ultimately confined them to wheelchairs as well.  I especially liked the descriptions of Queens in the 1950s and 1960s and the parts about family interaction and the way Jamie's brother went to bat for him and that they owned a beagle, although I disagree with the author's finding that the hound was homely.  Beagles are beautiful little hounds.  Luckily, during the roughest points and bleakest moments the family stayed together.  Christine's friends, Ruth and Tony sounded like genuine angels.<br /><br />The book ends on an upbeat note with the 1999 birth of Christine's granddaughter, Alanna Nicole.7 on October 16, 1980.

He suffers from mental illness and his behavior is erratic, bizarre and even dangerous.  In addition to the mental illness, he appears to have some autistic traits (autism is a neurobiological condition and NOT a mental illness) as well.  His obsessiveness; special interests; narrow focus on his special interest and his extreme devotion to minute detail are typical of people with Asperger's Syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum.  He is also one of the most unappealing characters in creation.<br /><br />The boy was close to a neighbor named Andy.  Doug and Andy were inseparable friends who shared a morbid interest in fire.  A fire in a treehouse shatters Doug's very existence and literally rocks his world.  From that point on, he becomes obsessed with Andy.  This obsession segues into other bizarre behavior, such as talking to himself.  This problem escalates to the point where a neighbor complains Doug is keeping him awake at night.  Doug coins the neologism \\"sigil,\\" for \\"signature/initials\\" where he encrypts his initals into Andy's in a picture form.  He insists on drawing this sigil on everything, much to the dismay of his art teacher.<br /><br />His English teacher tells him to expand his interests and write papers on topics other than his special interest.  Doug's attention to detail does have a plus side in that he has created a miniature village replete with a train made entirely out of matchsticks.  He even has the number of matchsticks he needs and the measurements of the imaginary town figured out to the last fraction of an inch.<br /><br />The boy's parents worry about him and have him seeing a psychiatrist.  The doctor does not appear to be overly helpful and prescribes medication that knocks Doug out.  He then stops taking the pills which didn't sound helpful in the first place.  The psychiatrist has the audacity to drop in on Dougie at his home after he skipped an appointment.  Who authorized that?  To make matters worse, she has the temerity to try to touch the town Dougie painstakingly created out of matchsticks.  He slapped her hand away and one feels that served the doctor right.<br /><br />Pills or no pills, his behavior becomes even more destructive and erratic.  His obsession with Andy worsens; he insists Andy tells him to do things that he would never have thought to do.  He stalks a classmate, even climbing a tree outside her window so he can watch her get undressed.  This continues until someone sees him.  This latest incident helps unravel him further, at home and in school.  Other kids shun him and a group of boys attack him to the point of severe injury.  Doug's delusions become even more inflamed and the results are tragic and reduced to ash.<br /><br />A very cutting edge book that will certainly remain in the minds of those who read it.matters worse, she has the temerity to try to touch the town Dougie painstakingly created out of matchsticks.

Her father forced her to have an abortion because he felt an out-of-wedlock grandchild would tarnish his reputation as an author of Christian themed books and his standing in the church he attends.  He is also a grade-A hypocrite.  Anna's mother is a shadow figure, an undeveloped character who seems to cling to the background and is merely an echo of the draconian father.<br /><br />Anna never reveals the identity of her baby's father - her photo teacher.  Sadly, she covers for him and after her trauma, he won't even give her the time of day.  It was a darn shame he wasn't brought up on statutory rape charges.  Anna, meanwhile spirals out of control.  She takes drugs; goes to all night parties with her boyfriend, Ryan.  After sneaking in her window during the wee hours of the morning, she is met with a horrible surprise.  Two men from Camp Archstone on Andros Island in the West Indies \\"kidnap\\" her at the behest of her parents.  They manhandle her; force her to say degrading things and drag her into their truck and from there, a plane to the island.  Anna tries to run away twice en route to the sea plane, but is captured both times.<br /><br />Camp Archstone can best be described as an idyllic hell.  The island is described as idyllic in its natural state, but the camp itself is hell, plain and simple.  The girls serving 12 weeks (\\"longer if we feel you need it\\") there were quasi military uniforms; line up and risk beatings; being locked \\"in the box\\" and other heinous punishments.  Even a simple softball game becomes an exercise in punishment; the \\"officers\\" tell the girls they have to give the game their all or risk severe consequences.<br /><br />One girl is punished for crying; another is punished simply for asking questions.  On a 10-mile hike, the \\"officers\\" tell the girls to know the geography and the terrain.  Naturally Anna hates every minute of it and the fact that during their enforced therapy sessions, the camp psychiatrist has been given full authority to prescribe medications.  Anna is very resistant to this.<br /><br />Nobody enjoys the hike and when one girl is injured, the director takes her back to the bunk/infirmary.  The others are expected to continue.  Their leader is a cruel, punitive man straight out of a military nightmare.  He slaps one girl, obviously relishing this and has physically abused the other girls.  His turn at bat comes up when he falls dead from a sniper's bullet.  The girls then have to fend for themselves and the next few days are a terrifying exercise of survival; finding snipers; drug dealers and other questionable types as they try to make their way back to camp.<br /><br />This book makes me think of a hybrid of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and some tired \\"Survivor\\" reality show.

Trapped inside a body that he cannot control and a tongue that protrudes, Petey was committed to an insane asylum in Warm Springs Montana bearing the diagnosis of idiot.  Once he is turned over to the state at age two, he never sees his family again.<br /><br />Petey's life is marked by a series of shift changes.  Once admitted to the Infants' Ward where he resides for the first decade of his life, he meets an angel.  The angel is a young ward worker named Esteban who responds to Petey and knows this child is no idiot.  The two bond and Petey learns to nod his head and respond to words.  Esteban brings Petey chocolates and sadly loses his job after he tells a group of visitors not to talk about the young residents in their presence or call them freaks.  \\"They are NOT freaks,\\" Esteban tells them.  \\"They are poor children!\\"  Sadly, he is fired for taking this stand.  That was in 1927.<br /><br />Petey languishes for a few years after Esteban's departure and, for the first time in several years is taken outside.  This trip is his transfer from the Infants' Ward to the Mens' Ward where he will receive total skilled nursing care.  Sadly, it is not an appropriate placement for this child as many of his ward mates suffer from a variety of mental illnesses.<br /><br />Fate intervenes; in the late 1930s a boy named Calvin was found freezing and abandoned outside the asylum doors.  Admitted to Mens' Ward, he and Petey become good friends.  Both wheelchair bound, the boys talk to each other with Calvin serving as Petey's interpreter.  They even make pets out of the mice who come to eat scraps and crumbs.  Their efforts are rewarded by their friendship with Joe, a kind ward worker who talks to the boys; gives them Christmas presents and takes a personal interest in them.  Sadly, poor health forces Joe to retire, but he always sent the boys cards every year until his death.<br /><br />The next angel to enter Petey's life was a loving nurse named Cassie.  Cassie's husband was in the armed services during WWII and she needed the job.  Once at Warm Springs, she, too, is drawn to Petey and Calvin and takes them out on the grounds and lets them play with her infant daughter.  Sadly, she leaves during the latter part of the war to join her husband, who has been stationed in New York.<br /><br />Life as Calvin and Petey know it becomes a metronome of monotony; they are ground into a routine until early 1965.  An angel in a Chevrolet arrives at the gates; by then the asylum has been renamed \\"Warm Springs State Hospital.\\"  Owen, a retiree and a widower picked up where Esteban, Joe and Cassie left off.  He recognizes the bond between Calvin and Petey and he takes a special interest in the men.  He even convinces the director of nuring to provide Petey with a better wheelchair.<br /><br />Owen retires in 1973 due to advanced age and poor health.  He periodically visits his friends, but the pain of leaving them is great.  Shortly after he retires, a \\"deinstitutionalization\\" takes place.  Many of the residents are shipped to nursing homes and group homes based on their needs and level of care.  During the winter of 1977-1978 Petey is admitted to a nursing home and Calvin a group home.<br /><br />Luckily, the nursing staff recognize Petey's intelligence and humor.  They learn, as Joe and others before them to \\"translate\\" Petey's words.  So does another friend Petey makes in 1990, an unlikely meeting with 13-year-old Trevor, a neighborhood child who protects Petey from bullies pelting him with snowballs.  In time, the young boy and the senior citizen form a bond that is truly heartwarming.  The friendship these two have takes them far and wide and -- back to old friends Petey made.<br /><br />This book makes me think of the 1965 Beatles classic, \\"In My Life.\\"  The lyrics of that song underscore this wonderful book.<br /><br />This is one of the most moving stories I have ever read.  This is a truly beautiful, uplifting, grim, serious, loving book.  It might even make you cry.  It is a testament to how love heals the spirit and is inclusive.

She also laments the higher standards at Crestwood High where she has to work harder to maintain the high grade point average she took for granted at Bryden.<br /><br />Within days of starting school, Dorry is approached by rich, popular Angela.  Angela takes Dorry under her wing and introduces her to a whole new group of people.  In time, Angela tells Dorry that the group is the Fishers of Men (or \\"Fishers\\") because they cast their nets far and wide to catch truth and weed out unbelievers.<br /><br />Dazzled with being part of a group, Dorry spends as much time with them as possible.  She receives social invitations such as to a Fishers' service in a local auditorium and to parties.  Initially friendly, the group's control over Dorry is insidious and frightening.  Angela calls her daily and insists that Dorry pray a certain way; she tells Dorry that the only the Fishers pray correctly and to pledge utter devotion to the group.  Dorry attends a fall retreat with the Fishers and sees people claiming to have holy visions and contact.<br /><br />Angela becomes more sinister and controlling.  She cuts Dorry off from contact with others; she or other Fishers call Dorry daily and they hound Dorry to \\"witness,\\" that is prosletyze and convert new members.<br /><br />In time, Dorry starts to question the Fishers and their motives.  Angela declares herself Dorry's \\"discipler,\\" meaning one whom Dorry will report to for all decision making.  Dorry even goes so far as to wipe out her life savings and give it to the Fishers at Angela's request.  Dorry also fasts on Thanksgiving, much to her dismay and her family's displeasure.

People with autism have trouble synthesizing sensory modes and have \\"hyper\\" sensitivity; that is, extraordinarily acute senses.<br /><br />James, whose mother wrote about his spectacular progress in Stehli's previous book, \\"Dancing in the Rain\\" describes his personal experience with autism.  A bright, well-rounded young man, James appears to be very accepting and open-minded.  I like the way he was avidly interested in the \\"American Girls\\" series and saw no reason not to learn knitting; it was a real skill he had and he found it a soothing activity.<br /><br />I loved it when James said, \\"...when you see your child lining up cards, for example, don't punish him for perseverating...don't see it as acting strangely.  See him as the architecht or draftsman he could become, designing the strongest buildings or drawing the straightest lines.\\"  James speaks to hope and potential.  He also addresses the very real problem of the word \\"perseverate\\" in any tense.  While many professionals and parents might find it a helpful \\"shorthand,\\" it is really just a negative and destructive word.  It is highly damning, judgmental and has hurt many and done far more harm than any good.<br /><br />James, like Stehli's daughter, Georgiana Thomas is an author.  Articulate and insightful, James focusses his chapter on the positive aspects of having autism.  Georgiana Thomas has written \\"Overcoming Autism,\\" about her personal experiences and at the time of this review, her book is currently available only on her web site.  Her book, together with James' work, \\"The Self-Help Guide for Special Kids and Their Parents\\" deserve places of honor along with this book.<br /><br />This is one of the most inspiring and uplifting books about autism that I have ever read.  Hats off to the people who shared their stories and for the Rays of Hope they have beamed each reader's way.  We need this book!have beamed each reader's way.  We need this book!	2005-06-04

This book offers a smorgasbord of honest views in re parenting teens/young adults and offered refreshing insights.  I was delighted to see two of my favorite authors, Joyce Maynard and Louise Erdrich among those included in this book.  Each author has helped shed even more light on an interesting aspect of their lives.<br /><br />The essay format personalized the accounts and made the reader feel included.  Joyce Maynard, a gifted writer included an essay about her son's girlfriend spending the night.  Her essay was unflinchingly honest; clear, sharp and direct as are all her works.  That is what makes them outstanding and effective.  I like the honest conversations she had with her three children and how she took a healthy and honest approach to sex and sexuality.  To her credit, she taught them the correct names for genitals instead of silly, infantile euphemisms.  One funny anecdote she shared was when her youngest child, then 4, sang about vaginas on a city bus, much to the consternation of his fellow passengers.  I like the way she responded and kept communication lines open for her children.<br /><br />Erdrich's account of her daughter's driving was touching and funny.  One can almost feel the snow and ice as they navigate the icy streets of Minnesota.  The inclusion of fathers' essays helped make for a nice balance and richer picture.  This book is a beautiful mosiac, pieced together by the brilliant works of each author.	2005-06-04

He rides his late brother's bike, knowing he \\"rides it for the last time.\\"  Immediately the reader is pulled into this very compelling, very intense story.<br /><br />Travis had an older brother named Richie who committed suicide in 1998.  Star athlete and favored son, Richie had been spoon fed a sense of entitlement from the beginning.  He graduates with the Class of 1997 with people singing his praises years later.  Indeed, Travis lingers in his shadow as his English teacher calls him \\"Mr. Ellroy\\" so as not to mistakenly call him Richie.<br /><br />The boy has a punitive father and a disinterested mother, so he is more or less left to his own devices.  The one thing that gets their juices flowing is when Travis sneaks into Richie's room, which is kept locked.  Richie is treated like a spectral saint in that household.<br /><br />Things take a toll on Travis.  A girl named Koryn whom he likes does not return his interest; his nemesis, classmate Jordan is hired as his manager at a local coffee shop; Travis lies and says he has been promoted; he throws rocks at cars after being punished and has the bad luck to crack the Sheriff's son's windshield.  P.J., the hulking thug never stops hounding Travis; he extorts more money from Travis to fix the windshield even after he has it repaired.<br /><br />Enter Daniel.  A cool, smooth, serpentine operator who slithers into Travis' life, Daniel grooms Travis to, in his words, \\"stand up for himself.\\"  He feeds off the latter's anger; he goads Travis into making some very deadly decisions.<br /><br />A very intense, riveting book that will leave readers thinking for a very long time.  The characters are well drawn; fully fleshed out and the story will indeed leave indelible impressions on readers.<br /><br />Nancy Garden's \\"End Games\\" is an excellent companion book to this one.	2005-06-02

A Godsend!	This is a much needed book for and about adults on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum. It is a Godsend! For adults with Asperger's and those directly involved with them, make this book your best friend. It provides a serious, honest and in-depth look at what Asperger's Syndrome is; how it affects behavior and relationships.<br /><br />An important issue that is addressed is that a/A behavior that is so often condemned is condoned when done by the neurotypical (NT). population. For example, tapping on things is a form of self-stimming that many NT people engage in. Swinging one's foot back and forth while seated is another form of self-stimming common among the NT population. Making dreadful exaggerated exhalation noises to indicate thought is yet another NT form of self-stimming. Jumping up and down and screaming with excitement is a common staple at sporting events. That is a form of overt self-stimming. Having an aversion for loud noises and rough fabric is not limited to the a/A population. People on the a/A spectrum are quickly condemned for bluntness, but many people with NT brains can be equally, if not more abrasive, judgmental and tactless. Just look at how so many people on the a/A spectrum are so harshly judged by NT counterparts!<br />The important issues to keep in mind is that double standards DO exist; what is tolerated among the NT population is frowned upon when committed by people on the a/A spectrum. One possible explanation for this is the manner and degree to which the behavior is done. The sensory responses by people on the spectrum are often accompanied by behavior that often appears bizarre to the NT population. However, many people with Asperger's CAN cover; compensate and learn cognitively to navigate in the NT world and mask strong sensory responses. Another possible explanation is that since so many people on the a/A spectrum have social difficulties, the behavior that is readily accepted among and by the NT population seems amplified and magnified when done by persons on the a/A spectrum.<br />People with autism/Asperger's cannot be browbeaten or humiliated into having NT brains or full NT understanding; excoriation and rigid demands on people on the a/A spectrum do not an NT brain make. The world is for EVERYONE and not just for the NT population, and yet apsies have been expected to make all of the concessions and all of the adaptations to suit the needs of NT people. This book does a fine job of addressing this important fact together with a plea for acceptance and tolerance. While no one method or approach works for everyone, this book looks at possibilities and explores options without making any promises.<br /><br />What a treat to find a book written specifically for and about adults with Asperger's. Asperger's is a neurobiolgical condition that affects sensory processing and communication to varying degrees, based on the individual. The book does a good job of providing explanations and offering good, practical advice. Hats off to this book!  We need this book!n done by persons on the a/A spectrum.

The 12th-grader is under a lot of pressure - financial reversals cause her to spend her secondary years in the public instead of the Catholic school she had previously attended and her college fund had been severely depleted to meet the family's financial needs.  Undaunted, Bernadette has scholarships and is ruthlessly driven to remain in the top academic stratum of her school.<br /><br />Her best friend, Nadine is also a high achiever, but lacks the ruthless self-discipline drive that Bernadette has.  The girls become friends in 8th grade after Bernadette is snubbed by a girl from a clique.<br /><br />The girls share a common romantic interest in their new English teacher, Mr. Frank Malory.  Newly arrived from England, he lends a touch of the exotic to their Michigan high school; his love for classic literature and flair for expression ignite a spark of academic interest among his pupils.<br /><br />His main interest is to see Wickham High School win the academic quiz.  Each year, Michigan high schools vie to qualify for eligibility in the competition.  Once he teaches at Wickham, the school's average jumps to an impressive 92%, thus qualifying them for the competition.<br /><br />Or does it?  Bernadette fears that foul play is afoot and is determined to get to the bottom of it.  She applies deductive reasoning to conclude that only by some deceptive reporting could Wickham have even become eligible for the academic quiz.  She, with some unlikely help works hard to unravel this possible mystery...and, at the end of it all, it is Bernadette who has earned that A+ honestly.<br /><br />This is an excellent, tautly written novel that provides a hard, objective look at cliques; social dynamics; school politics; administrative politics and the unfortunate results of same.  This is definitely an author to watch out for!	2005-05-30

This book is full of empty promises and is very misleading.<br /><br />Suggesting that autistic behavior is akin to bird behavior and the book's equally ridiculous theory of enforced hugging for people with autism is truly for the birds. There are enough holes in the theories presented herein to drive a fleet of trucks through. Enforced hugging is just an emotional elixir in some cases.  Donna Williams addresses this issue and rightfully so in her book, \\"Autism: An Inside-Out Approach\\" wherein she says that for many people with autism, enforced hugging meets the hugger's need only.  Hugging/holding then becomes a self-serving method that teaches force and compliance.  The rights of those who neither like nor want hugs deserve respect.  Williams has written several excellent books that address this issue, which has also been addressed in other recent works on autism.  Those forced to endure this outwardly comply, hoping it will end. It becomes yet another indignity people with autism are forced to endure.<br /><br />The Tinbergens compare people with autism to birds.  The main thrust of their argument is the negative and destructive \\"blame the mother\\" routine for failing to bond with the child with autism during the child's first year of life.  Baloney!  The book also claims that people with autism refuse to speak.  That is not true in most case.  There are some cases where there are physical limitations that preclude speech; some people with autism find it difficult to synthesize sensory stimuli and sort out sounds of speech into meaningful units; still others find just ordinary speaking tones too loud and confusing.  There are also many people with autism who are verbal and conversant. Communication is an inherent part of life; suggesting that anyone chooses to be autistic or makes their child(ren) autistic is to do a grave disservice to all.  It also isn't true.<br /><br />I really didn't like the grandiose claim that enforced hugging was a panacea for all behavioral and communication difficulties.  If that were the case, everybody directly involved with someone with autism would be doing this and basking in the 100% claim rate.  The sheer illogic and utter audacity of the entire premise is shocking.  Autism is NOT psychological, although the behaviors and responses to same often result in pyschological issues.  Autism IS a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing/integration and communication to varying degrees.  Not all people with autism are nonverbal and not all people with autism fail to thrive.  The same could be said of the neurotypical population.<br /><br />The topper for me was when mothers were told to vent anger at their children for not responding to them.  It sounds so cruel to turn what is supposed to be loving into something punitive and unpleasant.  I was thoroughly disgusted with people being told to yell at their children, level accusations at them and, in effect demand their children patch up their wounded egos.  That is not the responsibility of any child.  It is only natural for the children involved to view this type of hugging as a punishment replete with blame and restraint.  It is impossible to justify this as being \\"loving\\" when the outward behavior is anything but.  That literally made me recoil!<br /><br />The other thing that bothered me is that while mothers are being blamed for their child(ren) having autism, a similar burden is being lain across their shoulders.  The enforced hugging routine is purported to be a \\"magic bullet\\" cure and so by \\"embracing\\" this approach, mothers can miraculously \\"cure\\" their children.  In short, subject one's children to this method or they will remain autistic.  Tommyrot!  Just look at the title of this book!<br /><br />This smugly written book touting enforced hugging is indeed for the birds.  In fact, the expression \\"for the birds\\" comes from horses passing seeds through their manure.  Birds would peck at the seeds, and so the term \\"for the birds\\" has come to mean of minimal value and usually from a very questionable source.  Perhaps it would be best for all if the Tinbergens stick with ornithology., and so the term \\"for the birds\\" has come to mean of minimal value and usually from a very questionable source.

Kristy, the 13-year-old protagonist in this story baby sits Susan, whose autism is so severe that she does not communicate meaningfully. She has an extraordinary gift for music and can reproduce any song she hears on the piano. She does not play or interact with others.     Other kids soon learn of Susan's musical prowess and charge admission to hear her play. They exploit her talents until Kristy intervenes. Susan can also provide any given date and her mother explains that Susan once saw a perpetual calendar which sparked this interest.     Parts of the book reflected antiquated attitudes and misperceptions about autism. Kristy looks the word up in the dictionary and the definition provided was that it is a form of schizophrenia or withdrawal from reality. Autism is NOT schizophrenia and people with autism don't necessarily \\"withdraw from reality.\\" Indeed, people with autism often feel bombarded with outside stimuli and develop coping mechanisms to \\"come even,\\" that is to tone down the sensory onslaught that is so much a part of the autism experience. Suggesting that autism is in any way, shape and form related to schizophrenia has proved very costly to people with autism. Sadly, this kind of thing has caused many people with autism to be misdiagnosed. This in turn has led to many inappropriate treatments and placements being inflicted on people with autism! This kind of thing does not help anybody and has harmed many.     This book is not meant to be a diagnostic tool, but I wish autism had been defined in a more accurate way.  Rest assured, autism is NOT a disease but a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and communication based on the individual.  I for one am good and tired of seeing characters with autism being portrayed as having savant abilities. That only applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and I can't helpbut wonder if this story just reinforces those stereotypes of people with autism to the neurotypical population. Same old tired tune, just a different performer.     To the author's credit, no promises are made. Susan is by the close of the story enrolled in a residential program for autistic children. I did feel the story was extremely weak. I also wondered why Susan was sent to a residential school as opposed to a day program in her area.     Read Ann M. Martin's \\"Inside Out\\" instead. That is a much better book by this author about a child who has autism.  At least James is a Beatles' fan!	2005-05-28

At 15, he has broken into a hardware store; damaged the place; bragged about his crime and severely attacked a schoolmate who turned him in.<br /><br />This is the latest in a series of violent and antisocial acts on Cole's part.  Cole is quite familiar with violence; his own father, an alcoholic beats him at the drop of a hat while his impassive mother does nothing but reach for the bottle.<br /><br />Jailed and awaiting trial, Cole meets two unlikely allies.  Garvey, a Native American parole officer and his partner.  The two men suggest Circle Justice, an ancient Native American custom that recognizes the Circle of Life and the Circle as being a metaphor for the Continuum of Life.  The first step is to have Cole, the Matthews, the parents of the boy Cole attacked as well as their son and other interested persons in their Minneapolis community.  An Elder (or Keeper as she is known) starts the Circle off by insisting on full respect for the Feather; a person may only speak if he or she holds the Feather.<br /><br />Cole's start is anything but auspicious.  The Discals, whose son Cole attacked want him locked away for life; the Matthews appear disinterested in the boy while everyone else encourages the Circle Justice approach.<br /><br />Cole, Garvey and his partner leave Minneapolis for a remote island off the southeast coast of Alaska.  There he is provided with a shelter and the men tell him they will check on him every few days and bring back supplies.  Cole burns the shelter that first night and goes off on a tear.  A 10-foot white bear lumbers over toward him and Cole is ready to kill it.  No match against the beast, the bear mauls Cole, severely injuring him.  The men return two days later to find Cole barely clinging to life.<br /><br />From there, he is transported by skiff to a mainland hospital and from there, to one in Minneapolis.  After several months of intensive physical therapy, he is turned over to the juvenile justice system and locked away.  Once again, his mentors go to bat for him, dispensing a tough love the boy had never encountered.  They are somehow able to secure his release into their custody for Circle Justice, this time at the boy's request.<br /><br />Once on the island, Cole, quite humbled is ready to follow the instructions of the men and learn to live off the Alaskan wilderness.  The men teach him the traditions of the Sacred Dances; to help him release his anger, they have him do an anger dance \\"but only when he is ready to do so\\" and to carry the Anscestor Stone up the mountain.<br /><br />Cole's redemption comes about with the Gift of Forgiveness.  He extends himself to Peter Driscal, the boy he nearly killed at the beginning of the story.  The road is a Long & Winding Road and the attempts at repair, redemption and recovery (the three R's) make for a very intense story indeed.

He is violent; he smears feces on the walls; destroys his clothes; refuses to leave his room for meals; refuses to attend school or leave the grounds and destroys whatever is in his reach.  He is also electively mute and lashes out at others when provoked.  In reading Georgie's reasons for attacking his fellow inmates, one can see that his behavior was not without good reason.  Why institution staff don't appear to engage him more in activities or understand what he does seems rather odd.<br /><br />At the start of the book, readers \\"meet\\" Georgie in this institution in Wales.  Unable to cope with the boy, he is transferred by bus to another institution in the country.  Once there, Georgie meets angels.  The first angel is a teacher named Tommo who is instrumental in helping Georgie confront his memories of death and loss and provides him with books and a pleasant bedroom; the second angel is a student named Shannon who immediately likes Georgie and wants to reach him.  In time, the pair bond and Shannon takes Georgie under her wing.  Readers can't help loving the staff at this second institution.<br /><br />The other children in this home have a multitude of behavioral/mental problems and I like the humane way each child is treated.  Tommo really is an angel of sorts and one cannot help but feel encouraged about the nurturing environment in this Welsh institution.	2005-05-26

It helps dispel the tiresome cliche of \\"Rain Man.\\"  Sadly, many of the personal accounts show that many people's working knowledge of autism was confined to that fictional character with savant abilities.  Savantism applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and has ironically become a stereotype for people with autism.

Ms. Stehli, whose own daughter, Georgiana was labeled \\"autistic\\" is a shining beacon of success. Now married and a mother, Georgiana was nonverbal until the age of four despite having mastered all other milestones within normal age limits. She had hyper acute hearing and literally had to learn how to synthesize her senory modes. Fluent in six languages, Georgiana is an advocate of Auditory Integration Therapy (AIT) and is also an author on the subject.  Her book, \\"Overcoming Autism\\" is currently available on her web site.  It is one of the best books to date on the subject of autism.<br /><br />AIT is a science that is targets auditory processing challenges and, from all accounts, aims to work with clients to gradually integrate what they hear into manageable units; e.g., individual words and/or sounds at one time. AIT also helps people concentrate without being distracted by other sensory modes. A Dr. Berard has made AIT a recognized science and this book, \\"Dancing in the Rain\\" brings his work to the lay reader. This book is truly a song to the soul, a cheer to the conscience and a voice of encouragement. This book is the voice of hope for many.<br /><br />Autism and related neurological disorders such as Aspergers and PDD are fully explained in Ms. Stehli's works. Unfortunately for many, \\"autism\\" and \\"schizophrenia\\" have been used as \\"waste basket\\" or catch-all labels for persons who fit no defined criteria. One costly misperception that persisted until recent years was that autism is a mental illness, which it most emphatically is not.<br /><br />Another highly damning and judgmental perjorative is the word \\"perseverate\\" in any tense.  While many professionals, parents included might find it to be a helpful shorthand, it is  truly a negative and destructive word that has hurt many.  The terms \\"repetitive verbalizations and/or behaviors\\" and \\"special interests\\" are preferable as they speak to tolerance.  This book helps to undermine labels and focus on integrating people with a myriad of behaviorial as well as neurological challenges back into the mainstream.<br /><br />Based on Dr. Berard's writings, autism and its related behaviors are often a curious response to an overload of sensory input. Georgiana describes AIT as literally saving her life and the stories chronicled in this book make a very strong case for AIT indeed. In reading Dr. Berard's writings, one can see that his findings certainly do appear valid; other persons once thought of as autistic such as Raun Kaufman (\\"Son-Rise\\") seem to share the challenge of sorting out sensory input.<br /><br />I feel this book is quite helpful and I cannot recommend it highly enough.fully explained in Ms. Stehli's works.

(Horn Book Fanfare List (Awards))	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Gentle as a Lamb	Sheep are appealing creatures, known for being gentle.  Indeed, our very lexicon includes the expression, \\"gentle as a lamb,\\" so it comes as no suprise that many delightful books for pre-schoolers involve sheep in some form.  The ovine theme works like a charm in this book.  It takes its place among other good ovine literature such as \\"Sherman the Sheep\\" and \\"Sheep in a Jeep.\\"<br /><br />This book does a nice job of blending fact and fantasy.  Sheep are drawn in pastoral settings, happily eating daisies, grass and clovers as well as being anthropormorphized and engaged in human activites such as fixing a car; sleeping in a bed; taking baths and dancing.<br /><br />Young children will find that this book will keep their attention.  The language is clear and direct without overdoing; the point is made right off the bat.  Cognitive concepts such as color, up, down, in and out are included.  One can also interpret the sheep of many colors, blue, red, etc. as being a metaphor for diversity and acceptance.  The Quest for the Green Sheep makes for very humorous reading indeed.<br /><br />The writing, together with the excellent illustrations make for a very nice package indeed.  Regardless of level of degree in matters ovine, readers and listeners alike will enjoy the pure fun of this book.  People of all ages will laugh at the ovine antics and get a charge out of finding out the whereabouts of that green sheep!	2005-05-25

Orphaned at 7 and losing her sister to an adoptive couple who refused to take her, Lucy's life is a litany of one group home after the other.  She fears the dreaded last stop, \\"Rabbit Island,\\" a hospital/hell called a treatment center.  Lucy rightfully calls it on this misnomer as people are locked in their rooms; kept under surveillance cameras and restrained in their beds.  The place sounds like a genuine hell.  The young survivors call it \\"Eat Your Young\\" Island because rabbits have been known to do this in some cases.<br /><br />Once at Kindle, the new group home, Lucy learns the rules in short order.  The Baseball Rule of Three Strikes is in effect - 3 strikes and a resident is shipped off to Rabbit Island.  The place has a zero tolerance for violence; drugs; sex and running away.  Meltdowns and some violence are sadly a part of the lives of these young people; one boy is shipped off after his third meltdown and violent attack.  The Sword of Damocles swings over all their heads - the fear of serving time on Rabbit Island; the redoubtable group home therapist and the very real fear Kindle could be closed due to a lack of funding.<br /><br />Lucy finally meets an angel at age 16.  The angel is a counselor named Leon who sees through her aggressive veneer.  He literally puts his reputation and career in jeopardy to defend her.  He goes to bat for her when her principal tries to expel her for fighting on her first day; he explains to the man why Lucy defended herself and that \\"according to the Rule Book, ALL persons involved in the fight have to suffer the same consequences.\\"  The principal comes up with an appropriate punishment - he has Lucy and the boy she beat up clean up the school grounds after hours.  They bond during this period and their relationship evolves into a very close friendship.<br /><br />While Lucy's romantic fire is being lighted, other fires are also being lighted.  A series of fires in her neighborhood have called her group home under question; every child in the place is viewed as a suspect.  For several nights in a row, cars have been set ablaze and Lucy is determined to save the group home's reputation and find out just WHO the arsonist is.<br /><br />The list of suspects is quite long and the allies who go to bat for Lucy are quite unexpected.  Kind of reminds me of Andy & the Lion when Andy, thrown into the arena supposedly to his death is spared by the lion who remembered the boy who removed a thorn from his paw.  The point being, help and support came from the least likely places.<br /><br />Like the famous 1967 Beatle song, Lucy really shone in the Sky with Diamonds, in a matter of speaking.other fires are also being lighted.

Thanks to previous works by Frith and others, by 1985 spectrum behaviors were starting to receive more recognition.<br /><br />Ryan was first considered autistic at the age of 3.  He preferred shifting grains of sand and dirt through his fingers than playing with peers; he loved watching oscillating fans from infancy and had special interests over the years.  Some of the special interests, such as the color blue and any object that was blue limited his ability to converse with others; on the other hand, his love for early 1980s club music provided him with a conversational entrance to others.  I found it interesting that Ryan said his feelings were not hurt when another child told him she was tired of a subject he had exhausted.  I have known many people with Asperger's who take umbrage when told this by others.<br /><br />Ryan showed high reasoning and analytical skills.  When he was in the early grades, another child falsely accused him of breaking a blue ruler.  Since Ryan adored the color blue, the idea that he would damage something that color was highly unlikely.  Both sets of parents were called in and the culprit confessed.  I liked it when Ryan pointed out quite logically that falsely accusing someone to save your own hide is \\"what you would do to an enemy and not a friend.\\"  I thought Ryan's assessment was accurate and well thought out.  It surprised me that the adults involved were nonplussed by his response, but I felt it was good that Ryan pointed this fact out to his accuser.<br /><br />Sensory issues are a large part of spectrum conditions.  Ryan, like all people on the a/A spectrum had strong responses to sensory input/stimuli.  One glaring example was when Ryan would vomit during luch hour when he disposed of his lunch sack in the waste area.  I wondered why Ryan didn't just bring his lunch in a lunch box so he would not have to walk past the trash room and endure the stench.  Learning coping methods, e.g. avoiding \\"bad\\" stimuli and compensatory techniques is an excellent navigational guide for people on the spectrum.<br /><br />Ryan was fortunate in that he was more or less mainstreamed from the beginning.  He was also very fortunate to know what his diagnosis was.  I like the way Ryan's parents told him that he had a different form of autism when he asked why another autistic child was nonverbal.  Ryan sounded as if he accepted Asperger's as being a part of his life.  I like that.<br /><br />Ryan's parents fought tirelessly on his behalf and their check lists at the end of each chapter as what resources and options are availabe was invaluable.  That is what made this book more helpful and effective.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the word \\"perseverate.\\"  That is a damning, harmful, judgmental and highly charged word that has hurt many.  While many parents and professionals may feel it is a helpful shorthand, it is still an intensely destructive word.  \\"Repetition/repetitiveness; special interests\\" are much more accepting and much more tolerable.  The excessive use of that word cost this book one star.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job of debunking speculations. For example, when Ryan was 5 he liked sleeping on a low shelf in his closet.  The assumption that was made at the time had nothing to do with Ryan's reason - he explained he did this because an uncle whom he loved lived in a small apartment and Ryan used the closet to \\"play apartment.\\"ast the trash room and endure the stench.

Lucy is still in diapers and her language appears to be behind that of her peers.  Sarah's husband is an ineffectual boorish oaf who becomes addicted to cyber porn and even leaves Sarah for a cyber porn model.  He was previously married and has adult twin daughters from that first union.<br /><br />Todd:  The only likable adult character.  He is married to a ruthless, driven woman who hounds him to take the Bar exam.  He appeases his wife by pretending to take the exam.  To his credit, he finds joy in spending time with his son, 3-year-old Aaron.  Todd's son and Lucy's daughter are developmentally on the same plane.  In time, Todd and Sarah become lovers after Sarah boldy flirts with and kisses Todd on the playground in plain sight of the other playground mothers.  This comes as no real surprise to readers.<br /><br />Mary-Ann was truly for the birds and was just so impossible to like.  A ruthless barracuda, she schedules intimacy with the impersonal precision of a board (or in this case bored) meeting.  She is a gold digger, having married Louis only for his bank account, stocks and portfolio.  I didn't like the way she had her pre-schoolers go to bed at 7:30 just so as to make HER life easier.  She did not appear to be interested in her son and daughter and had all the loving warmth of a clinical report or financial statement.<br /><br />Larry - a thuggish boor of a cop who started an evening football team.  He also hounds the town misfit, Ronnie and, like Sarah's husband is the father of twins.  Unlike the boor/bore Sarah married, Larry's twins are boys and he is not fully divorced.  He makes horrific blasphemous comments about the Catholic church and Scripture which made his character all the more disgusting in my eyes.  He was a crass, boorish oaf.<br /><br />May - Elderly mother to Ronnie, a known pedophile.  The only truly sympathetic character in this book.<br /><br />Naturally you have to have an odd duck, so enter Ronnie.  A confirmed pedophile who has been released from prison, he lives with his elderly mother and is made the town target.  As reprehensible as pedophilia is, hounding and abusing people is no improvement.  It just perpetuates a harmful cycle.<br /><br />I found the way Todd's friend, a football wannabe just as reprehensible for targeting Ronnie, because what he was doing was harming the pedophile's mother.  He gets Todd to join in a night football team and after games, he takes Todd on runs to harass Ronnie.  They leave a sack of burning dog droppings on the man's stoop; they harass him verbally and whenever they see him in public, they hound and grill him.  Naturally this takes a toll on May, Ronnie's mother.  I was just repelled by what those bullies put her through.<br /><br />The book is rather bland and predictable.  Todd and Sarah become a couple; Sarah's bored husband finds life on the internet and in the arms of his porn models preferable to marriage in surburbia and the other playground moms limp through this tired tale.  One can only feel bad for May and these literary children as they are the ones who get shafted in this story.nown pedophile.  The only truly sympathetic character in this book.

Golden in the late 1990s.  She is a divorce lawyer living in the very real and very tony Manhattan suburb of Scarsdale, N.Y., together with her 11-month-old daughter, Zoe.  Colleen's husband leaves her after a decade-long marriage because he did not want to raise their child.<br /><br />Colleen's first husband is a shadow figure at best and a literary nonentity at worst.  Colleen is just as spectral because the book she purports to have written was actually penned by a ghostwriter.  Eric foolishly trusts her implicitly; Colleen is ruthless, unlikable and very selfish and demanding.<br /><br />Eric, on the other hand welcomes and accepts Zoe unconditionally; he delights in the child calling him \\"Daddy\\" and says he sees no harm in that and that if the child's natural father re-enters the picture, then they'll work something out.  He is equally delighted when daughter Sarah-Rose is born in the new millenium.<br /><br />Eric puts his profession and reputation in jeopardy when he accepts a client who has used Colleen's services regarding a rather acrimonious divorce.  In short order, Eric is taken from his home in handcuffs and serves time.  Real streets and towns such as Fenimore and Cooper in Scarsdale and the penitentiary in Valhalla, New York add to the locale's authenticity.<br /><br />Colleen is a she-wolf; a barracuda and a slithering serpent all rolled into one cruel, predatory creature.  She manufactures an image by lying about her past and trumps up false charges against Eric.  That leaves Eric to unravel the tangled webs of deceit this creature has woven and save his career, children and reputation.  The 1980s Duran Duran classic \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" fits Colleen like dental patterns and DNA testing.<br /><br />Colleen was so odious that it was a delight to see her dethroned and Eric's good name restored.	2005-05-19

Set in 1980, the year John Lennon died, the story is one of death, loss, coping and art.  It seems sadly a propos that the story takes place in 1980.<br /><br />The protagonist, Star (not Ringo Starr) is a Lennonphile who identifies strongly with Beatle lyrics, most especially those penned by John Lennon.  The 16-year-old copes with the death of her mother and with a psychiatrist as well as bullies and a father with a love for motorcycles.<br /><br />Star, per her therapist's request writes a song for her mother.  In so doing, she finds a letter her mother wrote to John Lennon in 1965 (the year before she, Star was born); a guitar and an obvious love for the Beatles among her personal effects.  Star has the guitar repaired and identifies with John's 1968 Beatle classic, \\"Julia\\" and solo work, \\"Mother,\\" both of which are about John's mother Julia.  Star takes John's maternal history to heart; she uses this as a springboard to writing the lyrics to her song.

I love it!<br /><br />Paul McCartney is not only an extraordinary showman, but serious and dedicated to his musical Muse.  He is a musical purist in the truest sense of the term in that he respects the art of being able to create and perform musically.  He paints musical murals with his words; he has a full range ability in performing many different musical styles which makes him musically versatile.<br /><br />I like the feeling of cooperation that appears to underscore the people directly involved with this show...it sounds like the entire crew had a wonderful time and enjoyed the fruits of their success in technically enabling Paul McCartney to do a spectacular show!  Paul McCartney acknowledges this which speaks highly of him.  He also accepts the outpouring of love from his audience with grace and aplomb, never losing his humorous approach.<br /><br />To this book's credit, Paul is not put up on a staged pedastal and fawned and spoonfed obsequious flattery.  The people who were directly involved in the production and execution of the concert were serious about doing their jobs well and that was reflected in the actual performance.  They were doing their jobs and not currying favor from anybody.  It is only natural to be enthusiastic at such a performance and no doubt making any contribution toward the show could only prompt enthusiastic delight.<br /><br />The photographs are delightful - readers see Paul having fun on and off stage; his lovely wife Heather and the crew who made it all possible.  The book speaks to professionalism on the part of the crew; the performers and those photographing and writing about the concert.<br /><br />This book is truly beautiful and there are many funny, touching, endearing and serious parts.  It is Gestaltism - the whole IS greater than the sum of its parts because it is the whole, that is the performer, the crew, loved ones, audience and all who had a part in the production who made the whole show/experience/book as wonderful as they are.

Nick Schaffner has done a superb job of sharing his personal love for the Beatles from both an objective and subjective standpoint.  Not only does he make personal references in re the Beatles, he also details the history of the band and the recordings they had released up until this book was published.  Certain references, such as the Beatles' hair length being comparable to then-president Jimmy Carter (1976-80) are what \\"dates\\" this work; other than that, this excellent book is a timeless classic.<br /><br />When I was in the 9th grade, I wrote a paper on the breakup of the Beatles entitled \\"The Gestalt Beatles:  The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts\\" and smile today as I think of how much I wanted to be a paperback writer.  There is no doubt that Mr. Schaffner has inspired countless hordes of fans in this manner.  I think of my old term paper because the writing in this book is greater than the sum of its parts - the combination of objectivity and subjectivty make for a very well rounded presentation indeed!<br /><br />I had the pleasure of meeting Nick Schaffner at a Beatles' convention and he graciously autographed my copy of this book.  He also shared stories about the Beatles and offered words of solace to fans still mourning John's death.  This book deserves a place of honor and is a must-have for the avid Beatles' fan.  Please read this book and share it with somebody.  You will be glad that you did.	2005-05-17

The cover photo was taken on Saturday, July 6, 1957 (just seven years to the day before the Beatles' first movie \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" hit the theaters, Monday, July 6, 1964) of the then-nearly 17-year-old John Lennon with his band, the Quarrymen.  The Quarrymen took their name after their school, Quarry Bank High.  Paul McCartney, then 15, was one of the boys in the audience who met John during this period and their musical union proved to be quite cataclysmic, indeed.<br /><br />This author has researched the subject well.  Not only are dates and places accurate, but so are the historical descriptions of Liverpool, a sea port town in the North of England.  Readers get a sense of England and the world at large in the late 1950s when skiffle bands captured the hearts and ears of the young British audiences and how these skiffle bands would, in turn, influence the world's greatest band, the Beatles!<br /><br />This is a must-have for all avid Beatle fans and historians in general will appreciate this book for its richly detailed, well reseached history of the times and place.	2005-05-17

The Hamiltons' oldest child, Ryan, was born in 1992 with no overt signs of autism.  He did not display classic or overt autistic behaviors until he was a year old.<br /><br />The Hamiltons were religious missionaries and spent the summer of 1993 in Russia with Ryan.  It was in Russia that that Ryan's language became depleted; his behavior consisting of more self-stimming than of actual playing and his developmental lags were glaring among his peers.  After that missionary period, the Hamiltons returned to the U.S. and began making the round of specialists.<br /><br />In late 1994, their daughter was born and Ryan's autism was all the more marked alongside of her neurotypical (NT) development.  Luckily for all, the Hamiltons began a megavitamin regimine for Ryan; ABA (formerly behavior modification) therapy and intensive training sessions for the boy.  By the fall of 1998, Ryan, then 5 and starting kindergarten was described as being \\"indistinguishable\\" from his NT peers.<br /><br />I like the way Lynn Hamilton includes scientific/physiological explanations for what takes place in the body when taking certain vitamins and medications; her knowledge of nutrition and her inclusion of world wide sites and agencies geared for individuals with autism.  I also like the chapter Lynn's husband Roger wrote, sharing his insights as the father of a child with autism.  One crucial point he made was to include the other children in the family, in this case their daughter when pointing things out to the child with autism and to take time to make little fun trips between therapy sessions.  An excellent point that was made throughout the book is that by providing services to children with autism will be cost efficient in the long run because follow up work with adults with autism can prove to be quite costly.  From a monetary standpoint, rehabilitation services such as housing and job assistance and also a purely human standpoint- the sooner services are provided to families who need them, the less likely the individual with autism will need extra help in the long run.<br /><br />Autism is presented in this book as a Rubik's Cube.  Like that famous cube, you can turn the many facets in any direction, yet to find that elusive full match.  Many different perspectives are given, e.g. physiological; economic; therapeutic and each interlocks with the others.<br /><br />As a Christian, I loved the way her faith sustained her; the inclusion of passages from Scripture were very moving indeed.

Agents and scouts court him; he has a bright future in baseball, so it seems.<br /><br />Todd's career is sidelined when he is hit in the eye by a baseball.  The eye trauma is so extensive that he loses the eye and, he believes his future in baseball.<br /><br />His friend Paulie won't let him give up.  He sticks by Todd through thick and thin, even when Todd's depression leads him into making rash decisions such as drinking at unsupervised parties.  Todd loses his abrasive girlfriend Melissa during his long convalescence and the pair re-evaluate their relationship.<br /><br />Todd has plenty of time to think.  Baseball was the focus of his life and Paulie's, too.  Paulie is the satellite who revolves around Todd; it is in fact Todd's encouragement (and trickery) that got Paulie on the baseball team.  An avid Tabletop fan and baseball statistician, Paulie's relationship with Todd appears to be only focussed on one thing - baseball.  As Todd recovers mentally and physically from his traumatic injury and psychological repercussions, he encourages Paulie to be more than his personal go-fer.  Paulie also copes with some major decision making and evaluation.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that attests to the power of friendship; the love of baseball; team cooperation and taking that team cooperation off the diamond and far beyond.  This is an author to watch out for!	2005-05-13

Zoe Hayes is a divorcee living in the Queen Villiage section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with her adopted daughter, Molly who is five. She loves her neighborhood as she knows most of her neighbors and Molly, an extraordinarily bright child has playmates at her ready access.<br />The story starts off at a climactic point when Molly finds a dismembered finger in the snow. The finger is an intact woman's finger with a manicured and polished fingernail. The local police believe that the finger might have come from one of the nannies who has recently disappeared.<br />One detective, Nick Stiles makes this case his personal challenge. Zoe, an art therapist at a psychiatric institution agrees to lend her artistic perspective to the police efforts as she feels she just might have some further insight as to the identify of that finger.<br />This is an excellent novel replete with appealing characters. Molly, an aspiring gymnast has a body as lithe and agile as her sharp brain. I just loved it when she asked Zoe if the Tooth Fairy was &quot;somebody you just made up&quot; and that &quot;Santa Claus is just a fake. Everybody knows Santa is really the parents.&quot; I love that! How lucky Molly was to know this at five and not run the risk of sounding naive by expressing belief in these myths at a much later age.<br />Nick is a delightful character and one that fits in nicely with the story.

One thing that bothers me that there are people who view DID as an exotic condition and who go to great lengths to try to convince others they are hosts to other personalities.  Instead of being exotic, it is a devastating condition that has cost people their jobs, families and in some cases their lives.  Cases have been reported where one personality was out to kill another and as a result, the \\"host\\" or \\"core\\" personality was the casualty.<br /><br />The author, who is identified as \\"Jane Phillips\\" started this book as a suicide note.  A survivor of fraternal incest and neglectful parents, she makes her way through therapists and treatments until one therapist, with whom she has established rapport finally realizes through researching DID that she does indeed have this condition.<br /><br />To this book's credit, Phillips is nothing like the stereotypes that currently exist about DID.  She does not have any extraordinary artistic ability that \\"surfaces\\" in other personalities; she is a college professor; she is somehow able to keep herselves in check while at work.  Embarrassing moments do crop up, such as when she has no recollection of someone her alters have met.<br /><br />One part that I really loved was when Jane went toy shopping at the behest of her child alters.  They implored her not to buy \\"some dumb bear with a dumb expression on his face\\" and \\"no dumb bears, ever!\\"  As one who also dislikes bears, that made me smile.<br /><br />Sexual abuse is often the taproot of DID.  Jane was raped by her older brother; when she was in college, she became involved with a violent man named \\"Jack\\" who raped her when she insisted that he move out.<br /><br />Like the famous (or infamous) Sybil before her, Jane had \\"fugue\\" states that she dated back to middle school.  She finally, at age 30 enlists therapy after suffering from migraines and panic attacks.<br /><br />Her childhood was paradoxical.  On the one hand, she was cherished as she was the only daughter and girls were a rarity in her family.  On the other hand, she was penalized for her feminity.  Jane's mother bought her a doll one Christmas that Jane didn't want and insisted she play with it; whenever Jane left it alone for long intervals, her mother would hound her to play with it, all the while telling her how lucky she was to have such a thing.<br /><br />Jane's growing feminity was measured and recorded by her mother; her breasts, hips and cycles were duly noted and she was not given any privacy regarding these very intimate matters.  When Jane makes decisions for herself, such as going into therapy in adulthood, her parents systematically and symbolically cut her out of their lives by having pictures of her removed.  Her mother makes irrational comments such as Jane's silver baby cup \\"is none of her business.\\"  That sounded completely illogical.<br /><br />I didn't like this book and felt it \\"glided\\" through some of the more harrowing aspects of DID.  This book is like bare bones compared to many other excellent, well-rounded works on this subject.  I recommend \\"First Person Plural,\\" \\"Katherine It's Time,\\" \\"Shatter,\\" and all the books Chris Sizemore, aka Eve has written about her own experiences with DID.age 30 enlists therapy after suffering from migraines and panic attacks.

Shawn, whom readers met in STUCK IN NEUTRAL has severe cerebral palsy.  He cannot walk; talk; swallow independently nor apply any self-care skills.  Unknown to all, Shawn is very bright, but cannot communicate that.<br /><br />Paul is a time bomb waiting to explode.  An accomplished student and athlete, the one thing Paul cannot fight is Shawn's condition nor his growing anger at their father.  Paul denounces the man; limits his contact with him as much as possible and is especially bitter over their father's winning a Pulitzer Prize with a poem about Shawn's condition.  Paul feels that their father deserted the family and exploited Shawn.  His anger comes out in the fights he picks and the dangerous risks he takes, such as threatening two bullies with immolation for attacking his brother.<br /><br />It is just a question of time before Paul crashes into self-destruction.  Time, a supportive coach, mother and basketball team help Paul put the brakes on the anger that threatens to consume him.  One line I especially loved was when Paul's mother tells him, \\"I'm your mother too, not just Shawn's mother.\\"<br /><br />Many of the anecdotes Shawn shared in STUCK IN NEUTRAL are revisited in this novel.

Shawn has a killer wit; a wicked sense of humor and an auditory memory that is off the charts.  He also has cerebral palsy.  Shawn cannot talk; swallow independently; walk or do any self-care skills.  He is incontinent and has seizures.<br /><br />The only really sad thing about this story is that Shawn is a bright young man trapped in a body that doesn't work and who cannot communicate so that others are aware of his inherent abilities.  Shawn learned to read by watching his sister sound out words; he learned to count and add in much the same way.  Most of his knowledge came from observation and listening.  Shawn is a very deep thinker.  He is also funny.<br /><br />His well meaning family and other caregivers treat him like an infant.  It is upsetting that many people assume that a person who has limited physical capacity and who cannot speak is also unable to think, feel and reason.  Sadly, many people in Shawn's shoes are treated as incompetent and are not taken seriously.  One especially poignant part of this novel was when Shawn was attracted to a girl at his sister's sleepover, knowing that nothing would ever come of his infatuation.<br /><br />Shawn, whose parents are divorced sees his father occasionally.  He fears his father will kill him (euthanasia, a word Shawn learned) and his fear escalates when Cindy and their father appear on a trashy tabloid talk show, discussing a man who killed his severely disabled son.  Their father is sympathetic to the man, showing his human side and discussing why he chose to \\"end his son's life of pain\\" instead of condemning him as a filicidal monster.  Other sides of the issue are explored.  Paul, who has a bad relationship with their father refuses to be part of the show, but he does watch it with the family the day it airs.<br /><br />Shawn's description of the self-contained class he attends at the public high school is funny.  Instead of feeling bitter at having to be fed, changed and endure infantile routines such as nursery rhymes and watching his peers put nonedible objects into their mouths, he views his situation realistically and with humor.  It is what it is.  He finds one of the aides attractive and jokes about a male aide.  I loved the way he described his class and was impressed with how tolerant he was of those working with him.  It begs the question of respect:  upon meeting a group that requires skilled care, it is generally best not to discuss the people as if they were not there and had no feelings.  Although not all people with severe physical limitations have Shawn's intelligence and insight, there is no way to prove which ones don't.  As a general rule of thumb, talking in normal tones of voice and not pushing infantile projects onto students such as Shawn's classmates to see what areas can be tapped seems like a good approach.  The best form of damage control is preventive measures and assuming people understand what is being said and done is far better than assuming they do not.<br /><br />This is a shining gem of a book and one that I cannot recommend highly enough.  I also recommend the companion book to this one, \\"Cruise Control\\" which is written in Paul's voice.<br /><br />*Note: In INSIDE OUT, the protagonist is Zach McDaniel Wahhsted.

Her older brother Brian is just as eagerly anticipating starting his senior year as Gina starts 6th grade.<br /><br />Middle child Elaine is going through a terrible adolescence.  She is rude and hostile; attacks Gina and on one occasion leaves her in the mall so she could shop and ogle boys with her friends.  Gina has the presence of mind to ask for help and finds Elaine and her friends.  I like the way she confronted Elaine and Elaine was rightfully punished for that one.  I didn't like the power struggles or spitting matches Elaine and her mother had.<br /><br />Elaine is like a toxic cloud.  Her venomous hatred infects the well being of the family.  Elaine steals money from Gina; she is defiant to the point of being out of control.  Finally, the girl's father tells her he will find help for her even if it means sending her to a hospital.<br /><br />Sadly, Elaine never receives this help because she is killed in an autombile accident shortly before the school year ends.  Gina is left with a lot of residual anger at her older sister and Brian offers the voice of reason.  Gina acts out much more subtly, including stealing a toy dragon from a store.  She returns the dragon and Brian helps her see why doing this could only lead to future problems.<br /><br />Sixth grade is not the cakewalk she envisioned.  An antagonistic teacher and a nasty classmate who jokes about Elaine's death make for a very ugly mix.  Things come to a head literally with a bang.<br /><br />This is a well written and highly recommended book that looks at death, loss and anger and adult foibles realistically and honestly.	2005-05-01

This book together with Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time\\" make for some excellent adult literature about autism.<br /><br />The protagonist of this story, Lou Arrendale, is a man who has autism.  He works for a large company as a systems/patterns analyst.  His cubicle is adorned with mobiles and other sensory treats that provide patterns for him to focus on when he goes on sensory overload.  Visual patterns can be very soothing and this finding is not limited to people on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum.  Many neurotypical (NT) people love watching fish in aquaria, for example.<br /><br />I loved the way physics was included in this story; Lou's co-worker, Linda, who has severe autism and loves astronomy wonders if light as a speed and if its inverse, darkness does as well.  Linda poses an interesting question: if light has a speed, would it not be pulled into a black hole by gravity?  I think that light probably has a METAphysical speed, just as time is a metaphyiscal gauge and its counterpart space is a physical measure.  I love that sort of thing.<br /><br />Lou, while clearly autistic sounds closer to the Asperger's end of the spectrum.  He is bright; verbal; independent and able to grasp very abstract concepts.  His autism is manfested in his slavishness to routines, even when those routines are not practical.  He does his grocery shopping on Tuesdays regardless; he does his laundry at the same time on the same day of the week; there are certain programs he watches and computer contacts he makes when he is home and these activities are generally performed at the same time.<br /><br />Lou is also a fencer.  His fencing coaches, Tom and Lucia, take him under his wing and commiserate with his dissatisfaction over the Center and an especially  unpleasant client named Emma there.  Emma is rude and hostile; she makes personal attacks on Lou one Tuesday when he is shopping.  She tells him that his crush on Marjory, a fencing partner will come to nothing as Marjory is NT and only sees Lou as an experiement or charity case.  I didn't like the way Lou naively defended Emma, even when it was plain to all and sundry just how hateful she was.<br /><br />Someone else has targeted Lou.  Three attacks have been made on his car.  His tires are slashed; his windshield broken and later, a bomb is found under the hood.  Unmasking the culprit and subduing the culprit is where Lou demonstrates his pattern analytical skills; the legal penalty for malicious mischief is to have a computer chip embedded in the brain so as to rewire/reprogram the brain from future violence.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written.  One humorous thing I caught was in Chapter 12, when Lou, says \\"Mr. Arendale (meaning Mr. Aldrin, his company supervisor) looks worried.\\"  Lou IS Mr. Arrendale!  A piece of political humor can be found as well in a text Lou is reading by an author named Clinton whose co-author has the middle name of Rodham.  Clever! I like that.<br /><br />Lou and the other people in his unit, all of whom have autism are given the option to undergo an experimental treatment to restructure their brains and \\"cure\\" them of the neurobiological condition.  Naturally there are questions; their angel of a supervisor Mr. Aldrin goes to bat for them and is able to rescind a previous order the company's CEO, Mr. Crenshaw, who is an autistophobe and wants to eliminate Lou's unit from the company.  Mr. Aldrin is able to go through the legal channels to ensure job security and to make this a voluntary and not a compulsory decision.<br /><br />A masterpiece of a book that recognizes the sensory responses and concerns of people with autism.  My favorite part was when Lou dispells a tired myth aboutpeople with autism not caring what others think of them.  That is not true.  People with autism as do NT people care very much about how others perceive them.  \\"What will people think of me\\" has long been a plaint among many people in deciding whether or not to disclose having autism.<br /><br />As Lou said in the book, NT people self-stim and engage in repetition and other behaviors that they are highly critical of when done by people with autism.  Lou does an exemplary job of pointing out this double standard.  I really like the way Lou ruminates over Scripture; the beautiful description of a Catholic mass and his assessment of very esoteric concepts.  This is light years and full speed ahead of the cliche Rainman routine!<br /><br />This book deserves a place of honor!t is not true.

The deeper her involvement with the Pack, as the young hate group is known, the more blurred her sense of morality becomes.<br /><br />Things come to a head when she shaves her head and has a tattoo of a swastika on her skull.  Her younger sister Shelby, 10, looks up to Lexi and wants to join the pack.  She even starts dressing in all black like Lexi down to a pair of Doc Marten boots.<br /><br />The Pack roams their neighborhood, demanding a \\"pure white\\" race, the \\"Aryan Nation once again\\" and call themselves Hitler's grandchildren.  They turn headstones over in a local cemetery; spraypaint racist words on a synagogue; beat up a child simply because he cannot see and congregate in one member's home because he provides beer and a place for them to plan their next attacks.<br /><br />Things reach a critical head when they meet Ursula Zeidler, an elderly woman living alone in their neighborhood.  Impressed with her involvement with the Hitler Youth during WWII, they ply her with questions and try to obtain any Nazi paraphrenalia.  Ursula Zeidler forces them out of her home, but not before they attack her, causing her to fall and break her hip.  Only Lexi tries to help; she tells the Pack not to hurt the woman and even calls 911 anonymously from her home.<br /><br />Ursula Zeidler's memories of WWII are interwoven throughout the story; one part that was especially sad was how a family with whom she had made friends and who included her in their Sabbath services were turned over to the Gestapo by her and another girl.  The thought of these good people being rounded up for death might make you cry.<br /><br />Things spiral out of control from that point on.  The police trace the 911 call to Lexi's private phone and that leads to her first session of questioning with them.  Ursula Zeidler's memories of the Hitler Youth and how she betrayed a girl she made friends with haunt her and she feels she has \\"failed as a human being.\\"  When Lexi visits her after the attack, she implores her to leave the Pack.  Lexi's hatred is fueled further by the fact that the rabbi's daughter is also visiting and that the nurse is black.  When she meets them, she has to try to justify her bigotry.<br /><br />The Pack meanwhile has their own problems.  A secret about a Pack member leaks; Shelby shaves her head and joins in some of their hate crimes and the story comes to a tragic, incindiary conclusion.<br /><br />A good look at how hate can distort the mind and how one who lived through the atrocities from a participant/witness viewpoint can move beyond hate instead of being a casualty of it.w she betrayed a girl she made friends with haunt her and she feels she has \\"failed as a human being.\\"  When Lexi visits her after the attack, she implores her to leave the Pack.

His older brother Daniel is already a man of the world at 8, providing Joey with 3rd-grade wisdom.  Even still, nothing can dampen Joey's excitement as he will be walking to school regularly with his older brother.  After all, Daniel can show him the ropes around their elementary school.<br /><br />First grade is nothing like Joey imagined.  A classmate named Ronald taunts him over his name; Joey does not walk out the door the first day knowing how to read as he originally expected; a classmate named Madeline who has a congenital visual impairment proves to be a good friend to Joey.<br /><br />As much as Joey likes school, he dreads dealing with Ronald and his bullying.  Madeline takes him in stride; after all, her older sister knows Ronald and his brother and she lets Joey in on a little secret - Ronald was repeating first grade.<br /><br />Ronald steps up his bullying of Madeline; during art class, Madeline was so stressed out over not being able to see how to draw she wets herself.  Joey walks her to the nurse's office and acts as her protector.  To make matters better still, Joey's mother arranges to have him walk her home on the days her sister has intramural practice.<br /><br />These walks turn out to be good for both children.  Joey learns that Madeline has musical talent; she can read and that she fears losing what little vision she has as her eyes \\"keep getting worse.\\"  Madeline is very matter-of-fact; she is extraordinarily bright and independent.  In a delightful conclusion, it is Madeline who indirectly helps Ronald \\"see\\" her in a new light.<br /><br />This is truly an excellent book.	2005-04-29

That is what caught my attention.<br /><br />When Andy Fleck's natural parents declare him a ward of the state, the boy, then 12 is placed in a Boys' Home.  The place sounds more like a hospital/institution than any kind of home.  The \\"school\\" the boys attend is, in Andy's words \\"a pretend school\\" where they are not given age appropriate activies nor work commensurate with their ability levels.  There is even locked seclusion rooms for out of control moments.<br /><br />Andy's natural parents drank and fought; Andy even says he remembers them throwing things at each other over his crib.  He had the crib until age 5 because \\"they didn't have money to buy me a real bed until then.\\"  Although he voices loyalty to them, each memory he shares about them paints a very bleak life indeed.  Andy responds by lying, stealing and truancy.  He also has Attention Deficit Disorder and takes two medications.<br /><br />Once at the Home, Andy goes on trial foster homes, none of which work out.  Some of the homes, such as the one with \\"Dumb Donald and Weird Joan\\" were abusive.  Each time, Andy manages to get returned to the Home.  His angel of a social worker, Alison, works tirelessly on his behalf to find him a suitable placement.  Andy also, along with the other boys gets to meet prospective adoptive parents.  It is during one of these Sunday gatherings that he meets the Sizeracys.<br /><br />A kind, loving couple, the Sizeracys agree to take Andy for a trial.  Andy, despite his man-of-the-world exterior, still is attached to his stuffed toys and loves being read to at night.  He appears to thrive at the Sizeracys, although he continues his pattern of lying, stealing and truancy.  Each time the Sizeracys go to bat for him and in an especially touching scene, the boy's foster father gives him the benefit of the doubt when Andy is accused of stealing $20.00 from a teacher.<br /><br />Despite the bumpy road and the predictable ending, it is still an  entertaining read.

I can think of nothing more cruel and counterproductive than to withhold diagnoses and direct requests for information from a person.  It always seemed so stupid to keep vital parts of a person's life from them and does not appear to have served anyone well.<br /><br />There is no one answer.  Adolescence is a time of identity quest and for those on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum, it is an act of kindness and honesty for them to know if they have Asperger's.  It is up to the individual to decide whether or not they want to disclose that information with others.  As for professionals who are in direct contact with adolescents on the spectrum, I think they are the ones who most need to look beyond the label.	2005-04-26

Diagnosed as schizophrenic, Zach lives with his illness and discusses it honestly, openly and frankly wit everyone he encounters.  Zach has classic psychotic symptoms such as the difficulty in sorting out fact from fiction; auditory and tactile hallucintions; minimal social skills; poor judgment; bizarre ideations; bizarre verbalizations and suicide attempts.  Each chapter opens with clinical notes and excerpts of letters about Zach.<br /><br />Zach suffered from adolescent onset psychosis.  His first episode with the illness occurred when he was 14 and found wandering the streets barefoot.  From there, he is taken to Clearwater State Hospital where a benevolent pyschiatrist, Dr. Calvin Curtis (\\"Dr. Curt\\") takes over the boy's care.  He is honest with Zach's mother; the boy has an especially severe form of schizophrenia and at best, can hope for remission through medication.  Since Zach experiences a crawling sensation on his skin when his meds wear off, the doctor warns that this signified a poor prognosis and and that young men who suffer this side effect often commit suicide.<br /><br />The story opens with a rush as Zach enters a local coffee shop in Spokane.  His sole goal is to get maple bars and his meds.  Zach tells all and sundry that at 3:30 he \\"takes his medicine\\" and Zach's mother has agreed to meet him at the shop with his medicine.  A robbery is taking place and each patron and employee are held hostage by two teenage robbers.  Zach talks to the boys, Joey aka \\"Stormy,\\" 14 and Alan aka \\"Frosty\\", 17 and discusses his illness in an open, childlike way.  He plainly has no concept of privacy.  He also makes very personal comments to the other hostages, such as when he told one elderly woman with kind eyes that she had pretty eyes like a dog.  He thinks a child who is understandably immobilized with fear is a zombie.  Zach is not at all hesitant about sharing these observations.  The boys don't know what to make of him and the other hostages shy away from him.<br /><br />After a long stand-off, the boys finally release the other hostages save for Zach, who insists on calling his doctor.  Zach and Dr. Curt become heroes after they talk the boys into doing the right thing.  Once released, Zach's main aim is for those maple bars.<br /><br />The story reminds me of the 1968 Beatle song, \\"Yer Blues\\" as the lyrics of that song could easily underscore this book.

This is a brilliant work about being in an intimate relationship with a person who has Asperger's Syndrome (AS).  AS is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing/integration and is on the autism spectrum.  It also affects communication.<br /><br />Many people on the a/A spectrum don't care for hugs and find them intrusive and just endure them to appease others.  For many people with AS, hugs can be a sensory onslaught that can include an aversion for the feel of scratchy beards; perfume or body odor; the feel of the hugger's clothing and the feel of being enclosed in a seemingly \\"restrictive\\" fashion.  Many children on the a/A spectrum dislike loud displays of affection.  For neurotypical (NT) counterparts, the natural response when confronted with an adverse response to hugs is to draw the erroneous conclusion that people on the a/A spectrum are devoid of affection.<br /><br />The book takes its title from the Beatle coiffed character Mr. Spock of \\"Star Trek\\" fame.  The title character, Mr. Spock is clinical, analytical and seemingly devoid of emotion.  Sadly, a misperception that people with AS lack emotion still exists.  The term \\"Mr. Spock,\\" when applied to persons on the a/A spectrum was humorous.  People with AS often have a novel way of making assessments and that can be found in the following example.  I knew a Beatle fan, a young boy with AS who said of Mr. Spock, \\"He has a Beatle haircut and so do I.  He's like me because of that and because he can figure things out.  I read that the guy who made Mr. Spock up likes the Beatles.\\"  I like his reasoning.<br /><br />Since AS is a sensory condition, feeling is what underscores a/A (autism/Asperger's) behavior and responses.  Meeting the needs of all involved, the NT and the person on the a/A spectrum can be found in this book.  People on the spectrum have heightened sensory modes; sounds are amplified; odors are stronger; tastes are more pungent and tactile contact more intense.  The \\"Mr. Spock\\" syndrome comes into play because for many people on the spectrum, regulating emotions and \\"decoding\\" the facial expressions and responses of others is difficult.  \\"Coming even\\" after being bombarded with sensory stimuli often appears in a blunted affect which again reinforces the \\"Mr. Spock\\" syndrome.<br /><br />Still, this is an excellent book for adults on the spectrum and for those directly involved with them.  It brings to mind June Carter Cash's beautiful words of loving fairness, \\"I'll meet you halfway.\\"  We need more books like this.play because for many people on the spectrum, regulating emotions and \\"decoding\\" the facial expressions and responses of others is difficult.  \\"Coming even\\" after being bombarded with sensory stimuli often appears in a blunted affect which again reinforces the \\"Mr. Spock\\" syndrome.

Bright and musically endowed, she entertains herself by playing the harmonica when she isn't helping her parents run their Bed & Breakfast.  Money is often hard to come by, so she learns to scrimp and save and enjoy the visiting travelers.  She also has good friends in the area.<br /><br />One visitor makes a surprise splash into Megan's life.  Ten-year-old Sylvia presents behavior that is classic or Kanner's autism.  She does not speak nor show any discernible response to anything or anybody in her environment; much to Megan's dismay, Sylvia shows no interest in her black poodle.<br /><br />Determined to find a window of interest, Megan plays the harmonica for her.  Sylvia takes an immediate interest, so Megan gives it to her.  That is the most interaction she can elicit from her summer guest.<br /><br />When Sylvia and her family depart for Boston to keep an appointment they made with an autism specialist, they thank Megan for her gift and are astounded as Sylvia teaches herself how to play it.

One day she sees a boy her age calling for his cat.  A police officer named Mr. Kilpatrick, who is a regular in Carolyn Haywood's stories finds the cat and the children introduce themselves.  The following day Vickie meets Donald's twin brother Ronald and his cat, who is the twin to Donald's cat.  Fun and hijinx ensue with Vickie coming up with hilariously resourceful ways to keep from mixing the boys up.  She paints a D on Donald's forehead and an R on Ronald's forehead and when rain washes the paint away, she accidentally paints the wrong letter on each boy.<br /><br />The boys are staying with their grandmother while their parents are away on a news assignment.  Vickie is delighted with having these long term playmates and in one especially hilarous episode, Donald gots prickles and burrs in his hair which ensues in a crop job.  Not to be outdone, Ronald deliberately puts burrs in his hair so he can receive a baldy cut like Donald.  Once bald, the boys are once again identical, which create even further funnier hijinx!<br /><br />This is a book I've enjoyed since I was a child.  It is very funny!	2005-04-19

Katarina, 14 lives with her beloved aunt and uncle.  They are hiding from the Nazis who have been rounding up Jewish families and sending them to work camps.  This family is able to dodge the Nazis for some time prior to devising escape plans.<br /><br />They return to Slovakia in 1943, believing their home to be safe from impending Nazi attack.  Katarina's aunt and uncle tell the girl they are leaving the country for a safe house.  Katarina is then packed off to stay with friends whom the aunt and uncle pay for her board and care.  Months elapse and the couple receives no pay for Katarina's board and hope for her aunt and uncle coming for her ebb.  Forced to leave the home, Katarina romas the country side from one peasant town to another, seeking food and shelter.  (Parts of this book call to mind Kozinski's \\"The Painted Bird.\\")  After months of roaming, Katarina returns to her home village where she is reviled for having red hair.<br /><br />Desperate, Katarina beseeches a maid who had worked for her family to help her.  Anka, the maid, secures the girl's safety at a Christian rooming house as her aunt and uncle's friends refuse to take her back.  Reviled for being Jewish by the other girls, Katarina flees the rooming house.  Once again, Katarina roams the countryside, never losing hope that her aunt and uncle will come back for her.  She also never loses hope in her faith and the Catholic doctrines which she has learned from Anka.<br /><br />This is an excellent book about Eastern Europe during the Second World War.  I also like the way a pronunciation guide is included at the beginning of the book.	2005-04-19

She even renames her impoverished neighborhood in Canada \\"Pauper's Park\\" which would have been a more apt description of the place.<br /><br />Her penchant for renaming others is extended to a homeless woman in a neighborhood park whom she calls X.  She brings her food and chats her up when she is babysitting her younger brothers.<br /><br />Her twin brothers, David and Daniel, 5 have infantile or Kanner's Autism.  Both boys wear diapers and are nonverbal.  David was named after former Monkee Davey Jones because their single mother is an avid Monkees' fan.  I thought that was adorable and funny.<br /><br />Khyber is not without challenges.  She and her single mother learn to dodge social workers and other professionals who insist the boys need more care; she is the brunt of school bullies who torment her for being the youngest in her grade and worst of all, taunt David and Daniel.  That is the one line Khyber won't allow anyone to cross.  She defends her brothers like a tigress, attacking anyone who dares criticize them.  The one funny part in this book was when David ran up to Khyber when she was in a school play.  When her nemesis makes cruel comments about him, Khyber delivers her line with a swear thrown in for good measure prior to stomping off stage.  I thought that was funny.<br /><br />Things take a down turn when their mother decides to enroll the boys in a residential program.  Khyber is accused of vandalism.  She runs away and a group of female Elvis Impersonators come through so she doesn't serve time in Jailhouse Rock.  She learns the lesson of \\"don't be cruel\\" and it is a return to Heartbreak Hotel with a rather bizarre ending.<br /><br />I thought this book was just mediocre.

Richard D'Ambrosio, a psychiatrist describes the work he did with a young client called Laura.  Maimed and burned by her natural parents, Laura is raised in a boarding hospital.  D'Ambrosio spends long periods working with the girl, gradually drawing her out.<br /><br />D'Ambrosio had his own Long & Winding Road to travel.  Misdiagnosed as retarded as a boy, he served several years in what was then called a CRMD (Class for Retarded Mental Development) program.  He spoke Italian and the language barrier led to the ill-suited classroom placement.  An angel of a math teacher called Mr. Scott recognizes his pupil's intelligence and potential and encourages him, even pleads with him to show the school administrators just how inappropriate a placement the CRMD is.<br /><br />Once mainstreamed, D'Ambrosio's academic star continues to shine.  He in turn passes that kind of gentle encouragement on to Laura and one can take great joy in the progress she makes.  The horrific abuse she suffered during infancy and unsuccessful visits by her natural parents cause her to endure some set backs.  Once again, angels come to the forefront in the form of a surgeon who removed her scars and another who straightened her spine at no cost.  Mr. Scott set the wheels in motion.  Had he not encouraged his promising young pupil, the kindness passed on to Laura might not have occurred.<br /><br />This book is serious, loving and might even make you cry.  It is well worth the read, if for no other reason than to reinforce the message of kindness - pass it on.	2005-04-15

Edith is an unfulfilled housewife whose husband ignores her, whose son Clifford is a fat, indolent no-account and whose infirm relative George takes up a good portion of her time, ruling from the limited kingdom of his room.<br /><br />Edith's cat, Mildred is renamed Mildew by Clifford. This seems especially significant as Edith's life appears to be decaying and the infirm George is described as a singularly foul man despite his illnesses.<br /><br />Her other cat, Nelson appears to be a symbol of her own rapidly deteriorating mental health. Nelson circles the periphery of a place, just as Edith circles the periphery of madness before finally taking the plunge. An unemotional divorce, an ineffectual son and the pressures of maintaining a normal facade get to be too great for Edith. Her husband's departure appears to be somewhat anticlimatic, as does the start of his second family. Clifford, too, remains on the periphery of life. He does not appear to have any interests or apsirations.  Never an able student, Clifford seeks refuge in fleeting relationships and is dismally disappointed by every woman he ever tried to woo.<br /><br />Edith finally plunges into fantasy. She writes of a fictious life, one she wished she had. Edith starts by creating a fictional university background for Clifford, although the boy barely got through high school. She invents an engineering career for him and a brilliant career in that field. She creates an imaginary wife for Clifford, an imaginary wedding, imaginary children and equally imaginary lives involving all of them.<br /><br />Things take a drastic turn when she begins knitting for her imaginary grandchildren, making clay busts of their heads and fully retreating into her diary. The line between reality and fantasy finally merge for Edith and she cannot turn back to reality.  On April 12, 1975 she becomes a casualty of her fantasies.<br /><br />This is a very sad, gritty book about how one woman succumbed to madness. It is well written with very sympathetic characters and one cannot help wondering what if Edith had had that fictitious life she wrote about in her diary.s is a very sad, gritty book about how one woman succumbed to madness.

He insists that the students in the high school history class he teaches stand and salute when responding; he teaches them the credo \\"Strength through discipline!\\"  \\"Action through Discipline!\\"  The students quickly respond and one boy who had previously neglected his stuides and personal grooming transformed into a serious diligent student under this new approach.<br /><br />In time, the students are so pulled under the Wave, as the movement is called.  They insist that other students salute them; they conduct Wave rallies and even attack a boy because he is Jewish.  Parents pressure the principal to take some action and it is only the teacher's clever way of bringing the experiment to an end with the help of two students who had their own brushes with danger involving the Wave to show just how fascism can be encouraged and developed.<br /><br />This was based on an actual case in California in 1969 and it illustrates the power of group mentality.

These stories cannot be recommended highly enough. Dr. Rubin clearly cares about his patients and the characters he has based on them. His compassion shines through like a beacon. These books are not to be missed.<br /><br />This story set in the years 1959-1960.<br /><br />David, 15, a gifted boy whose behavior is described as obsessive neurotic and compulsive meets the psychotic Lisa in a residential treatment center. He masks his obvious attraction to the girl by claiming to be clinically interested in her. She speaks in rhyme to suppress her \\"alter ego,\\" identified as Muriel. David unlocks the riddle of why Lisa speaks in nonsense rhymes and from that point on, he makes incredible progress. His psychiatrist, Dr. White and Lisa's teacher, John are compassionate characters one can't help but love.<br /><br />Jordi really touched my heart. I first read \\"Jordi\\" when I was 11 and it remains a favorite book to this day. Jordi was a very bright boy who lived in Brooklyn. He knew all the train and bus routes in the tri-state area and at 8, had not learned any academic skills. Jordi is clearly schizophrenic and his mental illness makes him confused about what is real and what is fantasy. He fears garbage pails because he thinks the opening is an ear that can hear him. He fears rain forests because he thinks trees will land from the sky onto him.<br /><br />Jordi did not fit into any mainstream program and he was lucky his parents had the foresight not to commit him to an institution. That was just too inhuman. Luckily for Jordi, a day school opened in his area and he was admitted. I loved the way he and his teacher, Sally, worked with each other. Lisa makes a guest appearance in this book with her teacher, John. They, too, help Jordi in that he learns that he is not the one being hurt when he sees Lisa kicking John in anger one day. Sally helped Jordi shed many of his misperceptions and I loved the way she and Jordi demolished a garbage can. She encouraged Jordi to identify anger and to vent it onto that can. By doing this, she allowed Jordi to explain his fear and she, in turn could tell him that garbage cans are inanimate and can't hear. She helped Jordi over many hurdles including academic work. It warmed my heart to read about Jordi's rapid progress in reading and in acquiring advanced mathematic skills. I loved the way Sally helped orient Jordi by showing him that he would always be Jordi regardless of which seat he occupied or what coat he wore or what changes occurred in his routines. She clearly accepted this boy and it is through their good work together that Jordi was able to break from the bond of psychotic confusion into health and social/world participation.

Forcing people to put up with hugs does not endear them to this; it is just another way of disregarding their needs.  Another problem with forcing people to endure hugs it that it only meets the hugger's need.  It is also a blatant disregard for the feelings and needs of those who don't want to be hugged in the first place.  However, hugs CAN be wonderful if the parties involved are comfortable with each other, like and want this.  There are benefits to hugging, and this book does outline them well, but there is also the flip side of the coin which is very rarely discussed.<br /><br />Hugging is NOT a panacea for all ills.  This review is NOT to discount the very real benefits hugging has in  many cases, but to address the needs of those who feel differently.  How unfortunate that something that has traditionally been perceived as loving and positive can be misapplied into something unnatural and forced.<br /><br />There are many reasons why there are people who are uncomfortable with and/or dislike hugs.  For example, there are some cultures where privacy is encouraged and people are not overly demonstrative.  In the cases of many individuals with autism, hugging can be highly unpleasant due to a) onslaught of sensory input and b) it can feel very restrictive.  In some one case, a child actually hid from a relative who would sweep down on children with loud displays of affection.  From the child's perspective, the hugger looked like a potential attacker and was just too loud.  Aversion for hugs is not limited to the shy and autistic population.  Not EVERYBODY is demonstrative.  Other conditions can also factor into this: being forced to hug and/or endure hugs from people one does not like or know; being told to hug someone \\"on cue.\\"  That makes for a very unnatural response/behavior indeed.<br /><br />Again, hugging is something that is often one-sided: it meets the hugger's need only and does not address the very real issue of people who don't want hugs under any conditions.  I didn't like the bear costumes and felt that undermined the premise of the book.  I also didn't like the assumption that when someone initially turns down a hug, they will eventually cave in and go along with it.  Donna Williams does a superb job of addressing this very issue in her book, \\"Autism: An Inside-Out Approach.\\"  She outlines the problems that this method CAN have and why it is really not a sure-cure for everybody.hugger's need only and does not address the very real issue of people who don't want hugs under any conditions.

However, hugs are and can be wonderful if all parties involved like and want them and are comfortable with each other.  That is the heart of the matter.<br /><br />In some cases, hugs are viewed as restrictive and punitive.  I knew a child who used to flee a relative who was known to swoop down on children with raucous displays of affection.  The child thought the hugger looked like an attacker and would run.  Many people with autism find hugs unpleasant and just another way of being forced to endure something unpleasant.  Hugs can also be intrusive.<br /><br />Very rarely has the very real issue of people who dislike hugs and don't want them in the first place been addressed.  Their rights should be honored.  Donna Williams does an outstanding job of discussing this in \\"Autism: An Inside-Out Approach.\\"  Having an aversion for hugs is not limited to the autistic population.<br /><br />Some cultures encourage privacy and hugging is not the cultural \\"norm.\\"  There is also the very real issue of individual tastes and needs.  Not all individuals find this a desirable method.  Being forced to endure hugs or being coerced to hug and/or be hugged by somebody one dislikes and/or does not know well is a disservice to all.  Hugging on cue seems scripted and unnatural.  How unfortunate that something which has traditionally been touted as positive can be used as a way of making people compromise their wishes and submit to appease others.  In the examples provided above, hugging appears to be a self serving act that just meets the hugger's needs.<br /><br />I didn't like the bear costumes the people were drawn wearing in this book.  That just reinforced the need to be covert when forcing hugs on people who'd rather not have them.	2005-04-01

Sam's mother Philippa wants to return to her native New England, so she and Sam leave Indiana and Sam's paternal grandparents and the farm Sam where Sam grew up.  Once in New England, Philippa throws herself into restoring the old house they live in and inspiring a love of literature to Sam and area youth.<br /><br />Sam's first friend is an elderly ornithologist named Gus Early who has carved out a career photographing eagles.  Gus tells Sam of the terrible floods during the 1920s that have wiped out four small communities.  This in turn has caused a reservoir and many families were forced to relocate.  Sam researches these communities along with the help of Philippa, who supports the boy's interest.<br /><br />As expected, Sam becomes fascinated with the eagles, the environment and their safety.  He confronts Gus' impending death and sadly accepts the inevitable.  He also has some other issues to contend with, including Lucy.  He meets Lucy while she is out on a nature walk with a group of children from the town's Home for the Homeless (what a depressing name for a place)!  She exhibits behavior that fits the classic profile of Kanner's or infantile autism.  She does not speak; make eye contact or interact in any way others can find meaningful.  Sam is drawn to the \\"mysterious girl\\" and visits her at the Home.  One thing that I had trouble buying was how the staff openly disclosed Lucy's diagnosis and history with Sam who himself was a minor and in no way related to Lucy.  Also, the definition of autism that was provided is incorrect - autism is NOT a \\"mental disorder;\\" it IS a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing and communication to varying degrees, based on the individual.  I also did not like the way the staff talked to the girl and moved her about as if she were an object.  Whatever happened to client confidentiality?  For Pete's Sake!<br /><br />In time, the pair bond and Lucy takes Sam through the world of the eagles, the mystical, magical, mysterious \\"time traveling\\" through their bond with the eagles.  Although it made for a fairly interesting premise and the descriptions and information about the eagles was first rate, I thought this was a rather weird story.  Time and space were fluid and not clearly defined; the way the time travel sequence was portrayed was a tad confusing and did not quite blend as well with the other parts of the story.  The other objection I had was that it was never really clear which time frame Lucy originated and the way her life history seemed to change on a dime.  I also did not like the fact that Lucy was \\"cured\\" of autism and showed no traces of the condition and how she was predictably adopted by Philippa.  That made for too predictable an outcome.<br /><br />The book was tediously written in parts and what weakened an otherwise good effort was the fantasy element.  That dragged in places and the fluid boundaries that time was given (a property that time really does NOT have - time is rigid and immutable) and the death and reinstatement of life in some of the characters made for a bizarre and somewhat confusing story.

I did not like the illustrations, finding them overly large and the colors gaudy and garish. I didn't like the way the characters were drawn at all and found them physically unappealling.  Mean Jean was especially unappealling with her oversized head and perpetual sneer.  I also disliked the nonsense rhymes, e.g. \\"lollapaloosh,\\" \\"kitz and kajammer.\\" What saved this from receiving a one-star review was the good faith effort to tackle the issue of playground despots.<br /><br />\\"King of the Playground\\" by Naylor, et al. is vastly superior to this book.  However, this is a good effort.	2005-03-30

Playground politics; office groups; clannishness among classmates; internet discussion board coteries/cliques - they do exist. Cliques don't end in childhood. Adults also encounter cliques on a routine basis, on line and in person, e.g. jobs and social organizations. Cliques and cliquish behavior are reinforced by constantly praising the same people and, in the case of the internet, posting on and/or starting threads that publicly laud and applaud the same people.<br />I like the way this book explains clique creations and dynamics. I have always wondered how cliques get started; who calls the shots and how one rises to social power in order to start a clique and how to be more than just a satellite if in a clique, but not the leader of one.<br />Kind of reminds you of Dobie Gray's 1965 song, &quot;The In-Crowd.&quot; That song's lyrics describe clique behavior to a certain degree.	2005-03-30

This book is an excellent navigational tool in decoding the Tacit Social Codes & Rules.  Asperger's Syndrome, which is in the autism spectrum includes a lack of intuitive knowledge of these Social Codes & Rules and their accompanying skills.  This book reaches people on the spectrum on the cognitive level and helps many to compensate cognitively for what is lacked intuitively.<br /><br />I like the way it empowers parents and educators to realize that not everybody can just approach a peer and make an instant friend.  Instead of relying on tired cliches such as constant reassurance at best or criticism/blame at worst, this book acts as a \\"how to\\" guide in order to improve social skills.  No promises are made and encouragement is given instead.  Had this book existed when I was a child, much sorrow and shame might have been avoided.  Compassion is the tone of the book and I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />If I could give this book a higher rating, I would cheerfully do so.	2005-03-27

Even the TITLE made me wince!<br /><br />Hugging is NOT for everybody.  For people with autism in particular, hugs can be viewed as restrictive and unpleasant and a form of sensory onslaught.  Enforced hugs do not engender love; for those who dislike this form of treatment, merely suffering through it until it is over has become the natural response.  People who are forced to tolerate unwelcome hugs outwardly go along with it, hoping it will soon end, never to be resumed.  Many people with autism dodge hugs because of unpleasant stimuli, e.g. the feel of the hugger's clothing; a scratchy beard; smells such as perfume or cologne.  Body odor can also be an issue.  Enforced hugs can also feel like a painful form of restraint and a punishment.  It seems cruel to make what has traditionally been considered a loving gesture into something distasteful.<br /><br />Many nonverbal people with autism find hugs intrusive and unpleasant.  Forcing them to endure hugs meets the hugger's need only.  That makes it seem like a self-serving method.  It is merely a stop gap approach that does not help everybody.  In one case, I knew a child who ran from a relative who was known to swoop down upon children with loud displays of affection.  From the child's perspective, the hugger came on too strong and appeared to be an attacker.  Having someone rushing/lungeing at you and making lots of noise can be frightening and extremely annoying.<br /><br />Donna Williams does a superb job of addressing these issues in her book, \\"Autism: An Inside-Out Approach\\" wherein she outlines problems with this particular brand of \\"treatment.\\"  She even rightfully challenges it by calling it on its insincerity when one is ordered to \\"hug on cue.\\"  That rules out sponteneity.  She also addresses the very real issue that this treatment, when misapplied just teaches those enduring it to \\"give the correct response\\" so they will be released.<br /><br />One issue that I wish would receive more coverage is the legitimate grounds for people who dislike hugs and honoring their rights.  Forcing people to endure hugs really does not help anybody in the long run.hen misapplied just teaches those enduring it to \\"give the correct response\\" so they will be released.

Acquitted of murdering his girlfriend, Emily and beating her brother Greg, David's parents help usher him out of their home state of Maryland to the home of his maternal aunt and uncle-in-law in Boston.  David had to repeat his senior year and hopefully start anew in Boston.<br /><br />Once there, David literally walks into a house of secrets.  His Aunt Julia barely acknowledges his presence and has been at swords points with her sister for years.  David's mother admits that Julia makes one want to rebel; when Julia cracks the whip, one wants to do the opposite of what she says.<br /><br />David agrees with her.  Vic, a gentle man appears to be at a loss as how to cope.  The death of his daughter Kathy at 18 has never really been addressed and was written up as an apparent suicide.  He and Julia rarely speak and use their 11-year-old daughter Lily as an emissary.<br /><br />Lily is a truly malevolent force to be reckoned with.  She trashes David's attic apartment in the family home; she destroys his things; she spies on him when he visits an artist friend who occupies the 1st floor apartment in the house.  Neither Vic nor Julia are aware of her behavior and propensity for cruelty and nothing David says will convince them.<br /><br />David's school, St. Joan's has an interesting group of people.  The headmistress, Ms. Walpole is a very bright no-nonsense lady who teaches his senior English class.  She gives the class a very interesting assignment which is to choose a person from the Middle Ages, real or literary and act out that person/character for the remainder of the year.  Each student will have to research the part and provide information about the time period and meet certain standards.  David meets a boy in that class whom he describes as a skinhead.  Frank, the bald boy is quite well read and clearly has a flair for the creative.  He is also extremely bright and insightful. (A generation earlier, boys grew their hair in rebellion.  Frank took the opposite approach by shaving his head).<br /><br />Over time, more set backs involving Lily occur.  In time, more truths are exposed and untruths put to rest.

I don't like the way the book leans heavily on the tired old \\"stranger danger\\" routine.  Statistics have shown time and again that in the majority of cases, children know their abusers.<br /><br />I agree with a point made in the review below about how children risk their own safety if they tell a predator, \\"No!  Stop or I'll tell!\\"  All well and good, but predators usually cannot be kept in check by a child's warning.  Children don't have the physical strength to fend off a predatory adult, so the premise seems a little shaky there.  I still wish the book would address the issue of what to do if abused by people one knows.  The \\"candy-bearing\\" stranger lurking on the playground, offering gifts of money, rides and other treats has long been dispelled, if indeed he ever existed.  In recent years, much has been done to help empower children and their families with knowledge of what to do if faced with such a situation; how to respond upon discovery and what steps to take to ensure protection for the child or children.<br /><br />Read \\"Your Body Belongs to You\\" by Cornelia Spelman; \\"My Body is Private\\" by Linda Walvoord Girard and \\"The Right Touch: A Read Aloud to Help Prevent Child Sexual Abuse\\" by Sandy Kleven instead.

One major message that cannot be overemphasized is that abusers are NOT always strangers.  Very young children are provided with tools of empowerment in this book and I like the direct way this serious topic of improper touching is addressed.  While the illustrations are somewhat bland and lacking in color, that still does not detract from the book's main message.<br /><br />I like the examples of unwelcome nonsexual touches such as enduring hugs and kisses from somebody the child either dislikes or does not know; unpleasant variations on \\"acceptable\\" touches, such as a hug that is too firm.  Good or acceptable touch is explored, such as holding someone's hand and kissing someone you like/love.  A good point about doctor examinations is given - although check ups are never pleasant, it is important to discuss with children why the doctor needs to examine every part of their bodies to ensure good health with no intention to hurt.  That is a special case, but it still needs to be openly discussed.<br /><br />Many children love to test out their new-found powers and in reading this to a group of young children and telling them to practice declaring refusal is very effective.  It is also very empowering.  Being loud with an abuser will undoubtedly get them to back off as predators do not want to attract attention to themselves.<br /><br />The drawback is that it can be somewhat awkward to explain to a relative or other trusted adult such as a neighbor why your child refuses a hug and expresses dislike for it, but honoring the child's wishes is paramount.  For example, there are numerous cases where children with autism find hugs too overwhelming because of  sensory stimuli.  The onslaught of sensory stimuli can be the feel of the hugger's clothing; cologne/perfume smells; feeling constricted and scratchy beards can make hugs far from pleasant or welcome.  Many nonverbal autistic children who flee hugs can have this behavior explained in this manner.  I knew one child who ran from a relative because the relative was loud and booming and known to swoop down on children with raucous displays of affection.  The child found the noisy display frightening and annoying.  From that child's perspective, the hugger's behavior looked like an attack.  Although hugs have gotten good press over time, scant attention has been given to \\"unpleasant\\" hugs and  the rights of people who don't want them.  Then again there is the child's personality.  There are people who are not overly fond of hugs and find them restrictive, and intrusive.<br /><br />The words of David Crosby from 1969, \\"teach your children... give them a code which you can live by...\\" is a good summary of this book.<br /><br />This is indeed an excellent book to help people protect their children from possible abuse, sexual or otherwise.  It is non-threatening and having the child/children participate by adding their voices to the work make it all the more effective.<br /><br />In addition to this book, I highly recommend Linda W. Girard's \\"My Body is Private;\\" Sandy Kleven's \\"The Right Touch: A Read Aloud to Help Prevent Child Sexual Abuse\\" and Cornelia Spelman's \\"Your Body Belongs to You\\" and Peter Alsop's excellent collection of songs entitled \\"Songs on Sex & Sexuality,\\" most particularly the song entitled \\"My Body.\\"  These are all family geared and outstanding teaching tools that will certainly go far in creating a safer environment.xplained in this manner.

This is a book I wish I had when I was a child.  The mother and child featured in this story are beautifully illustrated and I like the intelligent conversations they have about improper touching, whether or not it is sexual.<br /><br />The book respects readers' intelligence by using the proper terminology for genitalia and the generic term \\"bottom\\" to mean the buttocks.  I like that.  Too many works are weakened by silly euphemistic or babyish names for the anatomy that do nobody any real service.  This book is a good teaching tool and an excellent forum for discussion of a serious topic.  It is one that all ages would find beneficial.<br /><br />Another reviewer made the good point that boys also can be sexually abused and this is never addressed in this book.  I agree that this already excellent work would have been even more effective had the discussion included a brother as part of the discussion.  While it is only natural to want to preserve a child's innocence, it is still very vital to empower children with information about what constitutes desired (non-sexual) and \\"good\\" touches and what doesn't.  This in turn will help families build a more safety-savvy world.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job of defining \\"privacy\\" replete with examples, e.g. \\"private parts\\" are the parts of one's body that is generally covered by their underwear or a bathing suit.  The girl featured in the story declares that nobody can touch her private parts in ways she does not want and then goes on to describe other kinds of touching she doesn't like, such as sitting on her uncle's lap.  On the flip side, \\"good touches\\" are highlighted, such as loving cuddles and dancing and an arm around the shoulder.  The distinction could not be more clear and for that I salute this book!<br /><br />Gray areas such as tickling are explored.  Tickling can be fun, but it can also go too far where the one being tickled is not enjoying it.  That is another example of when to demand that a certain \\"touch\\" or tactile activity be stopped.  The children are well within their rights to do so at any time.  Hugs and kisses are described as generally being welcome and acceptable, but children should not be forced to kiss or endure being kissed by someone who makes them feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />The literary mother is very wise; she makes it plain to her daughter that it is the child's feelings that are paramount and not to worry about hurting somebody's feelings if she tells them not to touch her in ways she does not like.  Genital touching including being forced to touch someone else's private parts is discussed; the girl is also told not to take photographs of somebody's private parts or willingly allow anyone to photograph hers.  My favorite part was when the mother tells her daughter that the predator is NOT always a stranger and can be someone the child knows very well, including a relative.  That point CANNOT be stressed enough.  The child is told to try to escape as soon as possible and tell an adult she trusts what happened.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that there is a dearth of stories like this for boys as boys also can be the recipients of sexual abuse.  Since the girl has a brother, one wonders why he was not included in this safety talk since part of the discussion involved him.  His safety has to be considered as well.  Another good point is made by having the mother tell her daughter that it is never acceptable for \\"older children\\" as opposed to \\"other children\\" because that could be misleading.  Those few things notwithstanding, I feel this is one of the best books I've encountered on this very serious subject.<br /><br />I also recommend Sandy Kleven's \\"The Right Touch: A Read Aloud to Help Prevent Child Sexual Abuse,\\" Cornelia Spelman's \\"Your Body Belongs to You\\" which is ideal for the preschool set on up and Peter Alsop's collection \\"Songs on Sex & Sexuality,\\" most particularly the song, \\"My Body.\\"  All of these works address a very serious issue in gentle, direct and intelligence complimenting ways and are geared specifically for families.s a very serious issue in gentle, direct and intelligence complimenting ways and are geared specifically for families.	2005-03-24

It veers off into fantasy and that could be confusing for some children.<br /><br />I didn't like the way a lion helps a \\"gender-neutral\\" child disclose sexual abuse.  I felt the lion added a touch of the whimsical and detracted from the very real concerns surrounding the issue of child molestation.  On the plus side of the ledger, the feelings that accompany sexual abuse are not limited to either gender but are universal and that point is made in this book.  Even so, I would not have found this book helpful at any age.  The rationale the lion gives the child as to why predators target children was worded in a way that sounds as if predatory behavior was being condoned.  I agree with another reviewer that the reasons stated herein are NOT valid reasons for child molestation.<br /><br />As a child, I was led to believe that \\"bad touches\\" were only recognized as such if done by strangers.  That made me wonder if one had recourse when  \\"bad touches\\" were NOT executed by strangers.  Although I never bought the theory that only strangers were predators, the issue of \\"bad touches\\" being done by somebody one knew was not addressed.  Had I read this book during those years, I would have wondered why the lion \\"was telling that kid it's [bad touches] okay\\" for the reasons provided.  I would also have been angry and thought, \\"I don't like that [bad touches] and even if it's somebody you know, it is STILL bad.\\"  I amend my earlier stand to state that if it is somebody the child knows, that is far worse because trust issues are severely impaired.  One has no reason to trust or distrust a stranger, but in the case of someone a child knows, that makes for a more threatening environment.<br /><br />I agree with the good point raised in another review that the book appears to be more sympathetic towards predators and downplays the serious repercussions predatory behavior has.  I would think that by 1987, when this book was published, stupid myths such as this would have long been dispelled.<br /><br />I cannot in good conscience recommend this one.

Until fairly recent years, most children were warned about the cliche stranger, but very seldom was the issue of predators children knew ever addressed.  When I was a child, I honestly thought a double standard existed - improper touching was only frowned upon by one's caretakers if done by strangers.  During those years, I wondered why nobody ever said if children had any recourse if they were confronted with \\"bad touches\\" by people they knew.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully empowering book.  It also dispels the myth of the candy-bearing stranger, lurking on playgrounds and parks if indeed he ever even existed.  Statistics have shown that \\"bad touches\\" are very rarely done by strangers!  The text is gentle and simple without being overly so; it is something I would happily present to every child from 2 on up as well.  It is timeless; the message of assertiveness and respect for boundaries and the human body at large can never be over emphasized.<br /><br />I also like the way the book encourages children not to keep secrets if they are approached and touched inappropriately or made to touch someone else against their will.  Private parts are rightfully defined as the parts of the body one's underwear and bathing suits cover.  My favorite point the book stressed was what to do if the touch is neither wanted nor welcome and that it is perfectly all right not to want to be touched in certain ways.  The most important service this book does is distinguishes \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" touches and that for the most part, hugs and kisses are perfectly fine and acceptable.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Moose's 15-year-old sister Nat has severe autism (the term autism was not coined until 1943) and her behavior fits the classic profile of Kanner's, or classic/infantile autism.  She is preoccupied with her button collection; she counts objects and creatures in her environment and has memorized page numbers in book indices and tables of contents.  Devoted to routine, she has meltdowns when unexpected changes are introduced.  Her speech is primarily echolalic.  She also has a flair for numbers.<br /><br />Their father accepted a job as an electrician and sometime guard at the infamous prison and their mother keeps insisting Nat is 10 so as to stave off the encroachment of time.  The rationale for this is to ensure the girl a place in a special school that has recently opened in San Francisco.<br /><br />Moose, despite his challenges on the home front appears to have adjusted well.  He takes the daily ferry with the other children who live on the island to the public school in the city.  An avid baseball enthusiast, Moose falls in with a group of boys who love the sport as much as he does.<br /><br />Moose's second biggest problem after minding his older sister is the warden's daughter, Piper.  A sneaky snitch, she has a bizarre attraction to notoriety and will do just about anything to meet Al Capone, notorious gangster and probably the most infamous prisoner in Alcatraz.  She hatches a scheme to have the prisoners launder her classmates' clothing; the catch here is that she sells this service as \\"having your clothes washed by Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly.\\"  She alternately bribes and blackmails Moose to help her launch these schemes; she even uses his sister as part of her underhanded conniving plots.<br /><br />Despite some rather funny, touching and serious issues and set backs, Moose soldiers on, surviving Piper and the aura among his \\"city\\" classmates of living on the island once known as The Rock.  He and other kids look for baseballs the cons have hit over their highly enclosed baseball diamond as these baseballs carry the \\"aura\\" of having been a part of a prison game.<br /><br />This brilliantly written book is historically accurate and I like the way this author cleverly included Al Capone's mother in the story.  This was done so naturally and so plausibly that readers don't even question this.  Choldenko also includes a bibliography replete with notes about Alcatraz Island, citing sources and explaining where history \\"meets\\" fiction.  I found the early treatments for people with severe autism interesting and the descriptions of the woefully inadequate provisions that were made for people in need of services, especially during the Depression.<br /><br />A truly, brilliant work.  I can't recommend it highly enough and I will certainly recommend this author to the local elementary and middle schools.smates of living on the island once known as The Rock.

Although I was never a fan of the science fiction/fantasy genres, I loved this book.  The young wizards were appealing characters who reside in very real Nassau County New York communities.  Each wizard is introduced to readers, so people who have not read the previous works in this series won't feel like they have to play catch up to understand the flow of the story.<br /><br />Kit, the wizard who is featured most prominently in this book discovers his beloved dog Ponch has some wizardlike properties.  Boy and dog are able to communicate in ways they had never previously been able to do.  Nita, another young wizard in their midst is still grieving over the death of her mother, whose life was prolonged thanks to Nita's magical prowess.<br /><br />Enter Darryl.  A boy with severe autism, Darryl faces severe communication challenges and is enrolled in a self-contained program in a local Nassau County School.  Kit finds himself in the mind of this child, whose speech is limited at best, sporadic at worst.  He discovers Darryl mulls things over from different perspectives; changes his mind frequently; is highly imaginative as his mental imagery will attest to.  Along with this information, Kit learns of the dark powers of the challenging forces of the Lone Power who threatens their very safety.<br /><br />Darryl has prescient dreams; this is a characteristic many of Stephen King's characters have.  Darryl's autism is presented in a plausible and sympathetic fashion; although this book does not purport to be any kind of a diagnostic tool, it is delightful to see a wizard with autism and to see autism portrayed in a very different genre.<br /><br />Kudos to Duane for presenting autism in a logical and accurate fashion.  This book is beautifully and brilliantly written to include autism in a very different context.  I really like the way Kit's mother provided him with reading materials about autism and described it as best she could.  I thought it was a lovely act of grace on her part to allow Kit to take a day off from school so he could study autism with the idea of helping Darryl.ake a day off from school so he could study autism with the idea of helping Darryl.	2005-03-23

James has severe autism.  He does not converse;  he repeats whole passages of things he has heard; he has an aptitude for music and he sadly lacks self care skills.<br /><br />James' brand of autism is so severe that social contraints do not keep his behavior in check.  He strips in public; grabs any object that catches his interest and sings when the mood moves him.  I loved the parts where he sang Beatle songs; that spoke to cultural appreciation as well as excellent taste.<br /><br />The other children are adversely affected by James' behavior.  Liz has low esteem because she fears other kids will think James reflects badly on her and she is unhappy with her hair.  Jon does not know how he will be received in the neighborhood as well or how to explain James to people who don't know him.<br /><br />I like the earnest conversations the children have with their parents and how no promises are made for James.  He is accepted, but expectations are placed on him.  By the book's close, the young Beatle fan is enrolled in a special program to meet his needs.	2005-03-21

Red flags are first noticed at his third birthday party.  Other behaviors indicative of autism become more glaringly apparent as well.  Nathan makes his round of the specialists and special education programs.  He makes spectacular progress and later becomes a vital member of a basketball team.  He is also elected class president.<br /><br />This book is beautifully accompanied with photographs of Nathan; his family; people he works with such as teachers and therapists as well as his many peers.  Readers are treated to Nathan's trip to Jamaica to visit other family members.  Nathan's joy in his family and his pleasure in the trip will undoubtedly warm the hearts of all who read his story.<br /><br />I just love this book.  I also like the way things that are part of Nathan's life are photographed and identified such as the white Honda Accord.  Nathan's story is presented in a gentle and accepting way; in fact acceptance is underscored throughout this book.  Not only is the need for accessibility for Nathan described, but its inverse, accessibility to the neurotypical world is also provided.<br /><br />You will root for Nathan the whole way through and be so delighted to be part of his team.  Way to go, Team Nathan!	2005-03-21

The second of three girls, she is the opposite of her older sister, Elizabeth, 14 and younger sister Kate, 8.  Elizabeth looks down on Ant and Kate keeps a notebook of Ant's misdeeds and blackmails Ant out of her allowance.  Ant looks nothing like her sisters who are pampered into ultra-indulgence by their mother.  I admit I could not stand their mother at all and derived a wicked pleasure that Ant didn't like her either.<br /><br />At the story's opening, Ant is called into the principal's office after she tells her art teacher she is adopted.  Naturally Ant squirms at being called on the carpet, but even more so at having her mother present.  I thought it served the mother right when Ant kept insisting she was adopted.  I just loved the way Ant interpreted that tired, cliche story of the boy who cried wolf.  Her principal told her to relate that story and asked her what lesson the boy learned.  Ant's logical response was \\"Nothing.  He's dead.\\"  I thought that was an excellent answer.  When asked what the boy should have done, Ant said that he was stupid for expecting people to help in the first place and that had she been in his shoes, she would have handled that wolf by herself.  Ant's interpretation of this shopworn story was logical and delightfully perceptive.<br /><br />In fact, Ant does more than handle a wolf by herself.  She saves her dog's life by sneaking him to a vet and lying about her address so as to dodge the bills; she, along with her art teacher and best friend Harrison (probably named for George Harrison) spend Saturdays at a local zoo as zookeepers' helpers where she bravely saves her chihuahua mix from becoming lion food.<br /><br />I didn't like Ant's sisters or parents at all.  When Ant's father, an errant insurance salesman who lies about where he has been working praised the oldest and youngest daughters for their ballet, he stumbles offering predictions of Ant's future.  When one of the snotty sisters suggests Ant will become a juvenile delinquent, they all laugh at her.  I didn't like that.<br /><br />I loved it when Ant and her friend Harrison switch report cards because she wanted him to get better grades.  A bright, artistic boy raised by a loving, widowed father, Harrison and Ant form a strong allegiance that includes their art teacher.  When Ant's mother discovers the switch, it was hilarious because naturally she did not expect Ant to earn top grades.<br /><br />Ant's mother is a real thorn in everybody's collective side.  She makes it plain she'd rather attend one of Elizabeth's many dance recitals than Ant's Mathathon wherein Ant won the district trophy; she even tells Ant that she prefers the other girls and closes with \\"who wouldn't?\\"  No wonder Ant could not abide her.  I also didn't like the way Ant's father didn't even try to attend her Mathathon or even realize why it would be important to her to have somebody there regardless of what she said.  I loved it when Ant challenged her mother when she told Ant she could not attend the Mathathon by saying that of course she could not be there and that she was \\"just agreeing\\" with her.  After all, the mother said she had to attend Elizabeth's recital.  I also loved the art teacher and thought she handled Ant's mother with grace and charm.<br /><br />An excellent, tautly written work for all ages, this book will leave readers thinking for a long time.  This is an author to watch for - I hope she'll be turning out more books..  When one of the snotty sisters suggests Ant will become a juvenile delinquent, they all laugh at her.

It is an excellent and empowering tool that helps readers develop esteem and assertiveness skills.<br /><br />For me, there are fewer things more irksome and distasteful than brown nosing.  Taking command of oneself and being assertive, that is declaring one's needs without infringing upon the rights of others is a major accomplishment and does a lot to keep one's nose from becoming brown and clogged with wasteful residue caused by sycophantic servility.<br /><br />This book provides excellent examples of developing assertiveness skills which feed and lead into higher esteem and is helpful for ALL ages.  There is a strong positive correlation between assertiveness and esteem - that is, the more assertive one is, the higher one's self esteem is and the more positive their self image is.<br /><br />I wish I could rate this work even more stars.  It is a book for everybody!	2005-03-21

Beth lives in an undisclosed institution in Pennsylvania and derives pleasure in taking city buses conversing with the drivers.  The compassion many of these drivers displayed is deeply moving.  I like the way Beth is accepted by her community at large.<br /><br />Beth is brave.  She fearlessly strikes up conversations with all, drivers and fellow passengers alike.  She lives by the credo of being somebody who has never met a stranger.  She throws down a challenge - she insists that Rachel commute with her for one year on a Fantastic Journey.<br /><br />It is only natural that Rachel would have misgivings about doing this as her job precludes her from devoting a lot of time to traveling the city by bus.  In time she sees that Beth's early bird schedule of rising at 5:30 and riding those busses is deeply meaningful and significant.  She sees how Beth has managed to find fulfillment in her life.<br /><br />\\"Every day I wait in the queue, too much magic bus/to get on the bus that takes me to you\\" could be the song that defines the bonds between these sisters.	2005-03-21

His maternal grandmother is near death and he does not relish the thought of spending the summer in her house instead of home.  Joshua's mother insists he join her on this mission as Joshua's older sister Maggie and father have prior commitments.<br /><br />Joshua literally walks into a house of secrets.  He learns that he had an uncle named Patrick who supposedly died the late summer of 1959.  His Uncle Paul and mother Joanna have little information to share about this mysterious uncle.  Joshua however discovers a box and a trail of clues.  He finds a series of old comics drawn by his uncle; he finds a crawl space in the attic where his uncle liked to get away from it all.  From a series of enigmatic notebooks and brilliantly crafted drawings, Joshua learns that this mysterious uncle was an avid astronomer and had a keen interest in anything to do with UFOs.<br /><br />More clues come from a computer game Joshua receives as a gift and also on files chronicling the summer of 1959 on Joanna's computer.  Enlisting the help of a neighbor girl, the pair unravel a series of interlocking clues that lead them to...Joshua's uncle!<br /><br />This is a wonderful book that incorporates several genres.  It is a delightful, brilliantly written novel that is part mystery, part science fiction and horror.  I also like the way the author gives an excellent definition of Asperger's Syndrome and the affect AS has on behavior; communication and sensory responses/processing, as was evidenced in Joshua's Uncle Patrick and his paternal grandfather.  Indeed, many of the behaviors the grandfather was reported as having fit on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum.  The grandfather ruled with an iron fist and after 1959, nobody was to mention Patrick in any way, shape or form.  He became a virtual memory.<br /><br />Thanks to a series of letters the grandmother saved dated 1992-1997; a dogged lawyer; an angel of a doctor; neighbors and an enigmatic computer game and the work of the two Computer Sleuths, mysteries are solved and old ghosts and misperceptions are put to rest.nd the work of the two Computer Sleuths, mysteries are solved and old ghosts and misperceptions are put to rest.	2005-03-19

I wish I could give it a rating in the negative numbers.<br /><br />I am sorry, but this book was truly a stinker.  I didn't like the protagonist, potty mouthed shrill shrew and screamer Cindy Carver at all. I also thought the story was ridiculous and implausible.<br /><br />Cindy does some remarkably stupid things, like allowing her 19-year-old daughter Heather have her boyfriend set up residence in the family home.  She also attacks and accuses people she suspects have abducted her 21-year-old daughter, Julia.  Cindy was such an asinine character.<br /><br />1.  The only time Cindy remembers Heather is when she mistakes her for Diva Julia, who has been missing for several days.<br /><br />2.  Cindy levels ludicrous accusations at people.<br /><br />3.  She has an annoying mother and equally annoying whinebag sister who charge and barge their way into her home.<br /><br />4.  She all but has an affair with her ex-husband who is truly a boorish oaf.<br /><br />5.  The ex-husband plays a very sick and macabre trick that made an already bad story even worse.<br /><br />The only likable characters were Elvis, the Diva Daughter's wheaten terrier and a trusting accountant named Neil, who endures that odious Cindy well beyond what the average person's tolerance level would have been.  I also disliked the stupid and implausible subplot with the next-door neighbors and their infant son.<br /><br />Skip this book.  The only things lost will be your money and/or your time.

At nearly 14, she has a twin brother who has severe autism and is an easy mark for a bully named Harry Roth.<br /><br />Alison's life changes when a great-uncle she barely knew died at age 93.  Her father decides that to honor his uncle's memory, their family will become regular attendees at their local synagogue.  Harry Roth's father is the Rabbi at that synagogue.<br /><br />One's heart goes out to the Rabbi.  Harry is openly rude to him; insults Alison and her family; ridicules Adam and storms out of the synagogue.  Rabbi Roth is at a loss as how to cope with Harry; a widower who mourns for his late wife, Rabbi Roth has no idea of how to bridge the communication gap with Harry.  He is devastated that his own son refuses to observe the Sabbath and attend Temple.<br /><br />Alison remains at sword's points with Harry; an accident Harry sustains at a summer camp has a drastic impact on them both.  The day of Harry's accident, Alison's mother storms into Rabbi Roth's office with Alison in tow to blast him out for not accepting Adam in the local Hebrew School.  She wishes him ill; she wishes his child were more challenged than Adam.<br /><br />When Harry returns from camp paralyzed from the waist down, it is Alison and the Rabbi who join forces for Harry.  The Rabbi offers to tutor Adam in Hebrew for his impending Bar Mitzvah; Alison offers to spend time with Harry and brings him books.  Their relationship remains thorny until Harry acknowledges why he has been tormenting the Shandling twins and just what his Jewish faith really means to him and to his father.<br /><br />Alison has a parallel issue of parental communication; she feels that the only thing that stands in her favor is that she does not have the severe autism her brother has.  After some soul searching on her part; the Shandlings' part and even that of the Rabbi and Harry, bridges are built and gaps are filled.

Like the Beatle book by Mojo, this one includes a myriad of magazine articles spanning the Beatles' careers as well as musical analyses, comprehensive biographies and analytical dissections of each Beatle.<br /><br />One drawback the book has are some inaccuracies, e.g. that George Harrison did not contribute in a musically significant way until 1969 with the release of the Abbey Road album.  That just isn't true.  George Harrison was a gifted guitarist and extraordinary lyricist who had been writing songs for years prior to 1969!  Just LISTEN to the 1966 stellar gem \\"Revolver\\" which has 3 songs by George Harrison.  The intensity of his lyrics and his unique guitar playing helped define the Beatles as the extraordinary band that they were.  Suggesting otherwise is counterproductive.<br /><br />On the plus side, this book digs quite deeply into history and provides fascinating accounts of the inception of the Beatles; Pete Best's dismissal from the group in 1962 and his replacement Ringo Starr; personal accounts from Best himself; Beatle manager Brian Epstein's first encounter with the boys in 1961.<br /><br />Each Beatle and the influences that helped shape and guide him down his individual Long & Winding Road are discussed in depth; their philosphies; political ideologies and core values and beliefs are explored as well.<br /><br />If you are on a quest for buried treasure, you will find plenty of it in this book.  You will uncover anecdotes about Beatle conventions; Murray the K, a New York disc jockey who followed the Beatles around during their first trip to America in 1964; his views on John's wife Yoko in later years; John's and George's tragic and untimely demise as well.<br /><br />Even with the death of two Beatles (at the time of this review), the book does an excellent job of portraying their staying power and how they continue to influence music and other art media.<br /><br />All in all, a solid job.  I highly recommend this one, yeah, yeah, yeah!, a solid job.  I highly recommend this one, yeah, yeah, yeah! <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-12

Some of the most glaring have been included below:<br /><br />1.  John's mother Julia remarried and she abandoned her son and never saw him again.<br /><br />2.  Paul was right-handed except when learning guitar because he was a left-handed guitar player.<br /><br />3. George Harrison soon realized that he had no talent for the guitar...it took him years before he could keep up with Lennon and McCartney who were \\"gifted musically.\\"<br /><br />4.  Ringo's first appearance on a Beatles album was on 1966's Revolver.  His face was superimposed on that of his predecessor, Pete Best.  In late 1965 when Rubber Soul was released, Best asked John Lennon why his [Pete's] nose looked so large.<br /><br />5.  George Martin won George Harrison in a poker game because the youngest Beatle played in the Dave Clark 5, another popular British Invasion band.<br /><br />There are more, but you get the general idea.

She assigns her students the task of keeping a journal with the clear understanding that their privacy will not be violated.<br /><br />Jennie Quint, an over-achiever, pressured by driven parents to succeed at all costs is the leader of a clique called \\"The Awesome Threesome.\\"  Bright and talented, she has written a musical and scores of music and is in the accelerated academics program.<br /><br />Hillary Lang is also an only child.  She shares some of Jennie's classes and over time, her adoration of Jennie starts to ebb as jealousy and resentment set in.<br /><br />Emily Weinstein has one younger brother and is determined to catch up to Jennie.  Dubbed \\"the Star of the East,\\" in part a nod to the Christmas musical she has written and also in part a mocking nickname for her high academic ranking on the East Coast, Jennie comes under scathing attack from Emily.<br /><br />The fall of the Threesome is an insidious, gradual progress that accelerates during the months of December and January.  The three girls and two classmates try to ferret out the screts of a new boy in their grade, a boy whom they nickname Paul Classified.  Paul in turn has a journal rife with tragic family secrets, such as a mentally ill stepmother and a sister who left home.<br /><br />In time, the students develop a startling awareness of themselves and the words of George Harrison seem sadly apt in this book, \\"it's easier to see the books upon the shelf than it is to see yourself.\\"  Jennie sadly discovers that in her household, she is viewed more as a trophy than as a daughter.  Hillary confronts her resentment and makes some startling self discoveries as well and Emily realizes that she has let anger erode her part in the Threesome and that of the three, it is her daring to step up to the plate for Paul that expands the Threesome to include other students.

Cassandra, 9 was kidnapped by her father when she was 5. Two years after being kidnapped, she was found foraging in garbage cans outside of a small store. She was then returned to her mother, sisters and stepfather. Violent outbursts and erratic behavior led to her being admitted to an in-patient unit. While on the unit, Cassandra's behavior includes lying. She was also described as being able to identify others' weak spots and use them. Her behavior had reached such a critical point on the ward where she was spending much of her time in \\"lockdown\\" or seclusion, especially after she accused staff of sexual molestation and harped on molestation themes to another child who had no known history of sexual abuse. Efforts to separate Cassandra from the other child became part of her treatment, as did identifying feelings; naming the real abusers; defining boundaries and setting limits and helping her piece her memories together lead Cassandra to greater progress.<br /><br />Gerda, 82 suffered from a stroke which affected her ability to speak. When she did speak, it was of her memories of living during the early 20th century; the loss of several siblings and the countryside as she remembered from her peripatetic travels in girlhood. Records from the local census bureau confirm her accounts; Gerda's progress is spurred even further by this additional interest.<br /><br />Four-year-old Drake also has speech issues. Like Gerda, his condition is purely physical. A congenital vocal cord condition affects his ability to produce words and use his mouth muscles for activities such as blowing bubbles and licking ice cream. A hit in pre-school and described as having no behavioral issues, Drake comes equipped with his ubiquitous toy tiger. After evaluating and observing Drake's progress in preschool, it was decided that he be evaulated at the same hospital where Cassandra is a patient.<br /><br />Unlike Cassandra, Drake is not described as presenting psychiatric issues and he seems to adapt to his surroundings. On one occasion, he gets to leave the hospital for an afternoon to visit Gerda, whose speech accelerates upon her delight at his visit. Gerda's accounts of her youth are especially touching and reading of this senior's progress alongside of two very young clients makes for a very pleasant bond indeed. Regardless of age, these people all shared the common thread of good humanity and the basic desire to communicate.<br /><br />In time, Drake's medical condition is revealed, along with it family dynamics and well guarded secrets. In time, more walls are knocked down as Drake's family confronts the truth about his vocal condition. Learning sign language and being discharged from the hospital accelerates his progress and readers can take delight in the gains he and his family have made.<br /><br />For these three clients, the sound of silence was broken.sandra is a patient.

Sarah, the young author of this book draws a rich portrait of her day-to-day life with her brother, Evan.  She provided all the illustrations for the book and her family is a rich portrait of love and acceptance.  The bright colors Sarah uses suggests hope and understanding.  I like the way she explains and understands Evan's behavior; she knows he likes to chew on frozen foods and uncooked pasta because he likes the crunchy consistency.  She understands Evan's way of communicating; e.g. she identifies the sounds Evan makes in response to certain circumstances, such has his happy humming when he is in water.<br /><br />I loved the way Sarah used technical terms she learned from Evan's team intervention specialists.  When she uses them, she says quite matter-of-factly, \\"All I know is we have fun.\\"  I like the way she interacts with Evan and accepts and loves him unconditionally.  All of the things they do together and all of the socialization she unwittingly teaches him through natural example, she is doing it for love and because it's just plain fun.  Get this with SUNDAYS WITH MATTHEW.	2005-02-15

Meyer...	...for this fund of invaluable information.  I highly recommend this book along with Meyer's other stellar gem, \\"Views From Our Shoes,\\" which addresses the needs siblings of people with special needs have.<br /><br />This book lends the voice of hope, confidence and clarity to the experiences many people whose siblings with special needs have.  It not only sheds light on many questions that often crop up, it also provides a safe forum to explore any and all sibling related issues.<br /><br />I like the way Meyer respects his readers' intelligence.  It is so critical, in fact paramount for people to be informed about the special needs their siblings have.  That is a good way to foster honest relationships and inclusion within the family.  That also promotes acceptance of the members who have special needs.<br /><br />Meyer's book serves as a medical, legal and educational advocate.  It provides much needed information about services in these areas.  I especially liked the part where people are strongly encouraged and rightfully so to make provisions for their children with special needs and to keep the other children without special needs informed of these decisions.  People with special needs are vital members of their respective families and each person impacts upon the lives of others.  That is still another reason why it is so crucial to have frank, open discussions with all the family members so as to keep the lines of communication open and to prevent secrets and fear.  The fear of the unknown and the lack of communication causes problems and helps no one.<br /><br />I wish this book had existed a generation ago!  I can't recommend it highly enough and it is a book for everybody, parents; all children; educators; medical professionals and the world at large.  I love this book!	2005-02-15

Siblings Paul and Judy Karasik tell their life stories as relates to their brother David, who has an especially severe form of autism.<br /><br />Born in 1948, David appeared to meet developmental milestones within normal limits during the first year of his life, save for speech.  In beautifully, brilliantly drawn comic-style illustrations, his younger brother Paul depicts family scenes with David and then only sibling, younger brother Michael going to a doctor's office while David awaits his verdict.  David receives a multitude of antiquated diagnoses given the times including aphasia.<br /><br />Judy and Paul, the two youngest Karasik children chronicle the parallels of their neurotypical development alongside of that of David.  Unable to stand changes to his routine, David insists on \\"putting on TV shows\\" wherein he \\"interviewed\\" politicians and copied the format of televised interviews.  When crossed, he would self stim and even hit his own head, screaming out names of television characters.  He also liked to list the names of the neighborhood barbers and seemed to derive comfort in anticipating his haircuts at their shop.  The barbers had established a bond with the Karasik family and would step up to the plate for their father when he suffered his final illness in 1992.<br /><br />Other challenges crop up in their family.  The Karasik children's maternal grandfather and his daughter, their aunt move into their home in 1969.  Their aunt, severely debilitated and profoundly retarded after suffering from a cerebral hemorrhage in infancy is installed in one room and their grandfather has the study.  An angel of a nurse named Dorothy White cares for the pair as well as the Karasik children.<br /><br />To ease Dorothy's work load, a night nurse is hired.  When Judy comes home one night and finds the nurse watching television, ignoring her grandfather's anguished cries and dismissing them, the first person she calls is Dorothy.  Like the Cavalry, Dorothy rushes over to the home to resume caring for the pair.  The night nurse's departure is expedited and rightfully so after her callous inattention to the patients' needs.<br /><br />Dorothy again steps up to the plate for her ailing charges.  She insists on having them move into her home where she and other members of her family can care of them.  This arrangement worked well until a fire destroyed her home in March, 1978 killing both patients, another relative who lived in the home and injuring Dorothy's husband.  An electrical short from a television in an upstairs bedroom caused the fire and sadly, the patients perished from smoke inhalation.  Luckily, the Karasiks were able to rally around Dorothy and her husband's side and continue a circle of love.  Dorothy sounded like a genuine angel.<br /><br />The professional and personal Long & Winding Roads of each Karasik are gently chronicled.  Readers come away with an enriched sense of life with multiple challenges - severe autism; sibling questions; elderly relatives' needs and sadly, the death of a parent.  The comic illustrations by Paul Karasik add much to the book and some are such beautifully moving accounts, such as the early one about David's diagnosis and later, the death of their father that they might make you cry.  The final comic strip in this book is also quite moving indeed.  Dorothy's kindness is also extremely heartwarming.<br /><br />There are funny parts.  Paul's middle school prank, as he drew many years later; Paul and David going to the Three Stoogeathon in their neighborhood theater and the HILARIOUS story Paul drew about that movie trip might make you laugh.  I love that!<br /><br />Judy describes watching the movie \\"Rain Man\\" on television.  Although the movie is never mentioned by name, it is plain that it is the movie she references.  In her words, it is a movie about somebody \\"with an autistic brother\\" who lives in a residence; can tell how many matches are in a box and who is taken out of his residential facility to travel the countryside with his neurotypical brother.  Although I didn't care for \\"Rain Man,\\" I found her comments about it in relation to her brother very interesting.<br /><br />David was enrolled in residential facilities that were unsatisfactory and day programs with varying degrees of success.  In 1995 when their mother, then widowed 3 years decides to sell the family home and move into a smaller place, the sad and frightening truth about David's then current placement emerges.  Mother and siblings band together and find a good program that will meet David's needs.<br /><br />This book really touched my heart.  I hope other readers will enjoy it and find it as moving as I did.the countryside with his neurotypical brother.

Curious, they investigate the source of the sound and find a newborn girl wrapped in a sleeping bag and left in a bundle of snow.<br /><br />Father and daughter bundle the foundling and rush her to the hospital to report an abandoned and endangered infant.  After enduring a grueling interrogation, Robert Dillon packs Nicky for their long trek home.<br /><br />The baby's mysterious arrival and placement under the tree haunt the fictional rural community of Shepherd, New Hampshire; local news coverage thrust the Dillons into an unwelcome spotlight.  Fearful of most social contact since the loss of his wife and infant daughter Clara in an automobile accident two years earlier, Robert leaves New York State with Nicky in the hopes of starting afresh.  Finding the baby in the snow throws all of his protective armor into a tailspin.<br /><br />Nicky, also is starting to spread her wings.  Resentful at being forced to move from her comfortable home in New York State and live in an insular community, she asserts her independence.  She challenges her father's quasi-hermit lifestyle.  Their home has no television; Robert does not have a subscription to the newspaper and only very reluctantly had a telephone installed in the home some six months prior to finding the baby in the snow.  He shuns most outside contact and Nicky's main source of socialization comes from classmates and the few neighbors in her area.  Never has her mettle been so tested as when she meets the foundling's mother.<br /><br />There are no heroes or villians in this story.  Meeting the baby's mother forces both father and daughter to confront some daunting truths about themselves as well as what forces drove the desperate young woman and the father of the baby.  No promises are made and all emerge sadder, but wiser.	2005-01-18

An accountant with rather conservative tastes, Harry decides to take the bull by the horns and act on his attraction to a woman named Lainie.  Lainie is an exotic dancer at a casino and the single mother of a gifted 4-year-old son named Dexter.  Harry decides that the way to Lainie's heart is via Dexter.<br /><br />Dexter!  An ideal emissary to spread his message of love.  Harry offers to babysit the boy, playing chess with him and enjoying serious conversations with the child.  While he disapproves of Lainie's job, he makes the child's safety his priority.<br /><br />Enlisting the help of his astute mother Rona, Harry brings Dexter to his home to meet her.  He chafes at how Lainie has virtually ignored the boy, yet he loves her.  He comes up with a scheme - he will pose as her husband while they take a trip to Sedona, New Mexico.<br /><br />Dexter also serves a rather questionable purpose.  A shady character named Joey wants to use Dexter as a \\"front\\" to prove that he, Joey is a good father.  Harry and Lainie catch wind of Joey's nefarious scheme and yet, Lainie wonders if the boy would be better off with his natural father who is rich.<br /><br />Joey and his equally unappealing girlfriend are eventually crunched at their game by a number cruncher and a chess prodigy.  Although Lainie tells Harry she felt no romance during their affair, she is delightfully proven wrong.<br /><br />Harry is a truly delightful character and you just want to cheer when he and Lainie find love.  Although I usually don't care for the romance genre and find most romance stories trite and predictable, I enjoyed this book.  It was funny; it was different and it gave a fresh slant on the plethora of cranked out romance novels.  This one featured a very different, delightful cast of characters.  Readers may find themselves thinking, \\"I'm so wild about Harry!\\"<br /><br />Yeah, the revenge of this nerd was worth every page.	2005-01-18

People with Asperger's are empowered with knowledge of what this neurobiological condition entails and how to act as their own advocates.  For people on the a/A spectrum, please make this book your best friend.  It will certainly pave the way down the Long & Winding Road to social acceptance.<br /><br />Tacit Social Codes & Rules are often ambiguous and confusing to those on the a/A spectrum.  This book does an excellent job of demystifying those rules.  Another road block people with Asperger's face is being misinterpreted -- what seems clear and direct and perfectly a propos to somebody on the spectrum sometimes comes over as a social faux pas.  George Harrison explained this aspect very well in his 1966 classic, \\"I Want to Tell You,\\" with the lyric \\"but if I seem to act unkind, it's only me, it's not my mind.  That is confusing things.\\"<br /><br />One of the major challenges people with Asperger's contend with is determining whether or not to disclose this diagnosis and if so, to whom.  This book helps clarify many of those questions and serves as a link to communicating with the neurotypical (NT) population.<br /><br />I love this book!	2004-12-30

People with Asperger's, which is a neurobiological condition on the autism spectrum experience social difficulties including communication.

This sterling work helps decode and identify tacit Social Codes & Rules.  For many people on the a/A spectrum, learning these nonverbal subtleties is a major challenge.  a/A related conditions are neurobiological and affect sensory processing and integration as well as communication.  People on the a/A spectrum encounter a wide range of social difficulties, many of which are addressed in this book.<br /><br />This work gives good advice on how to make and maintain eye contact; how to position oneself when talking to and listening to another; how to appear natural in practicing these skills.  This book also gives a good explanation of how to \\"read\\" people socially and how to learn to anticipate possible seeming changes in the Tacit Social Codes & Rules.  People with neurotypical (NT) brains already know these Rules and NT readers also can benefit from this book by seeing what people on the a/A spectrum contend with.  Rather, people on the a/A spectrum learn these behaviors cognitively as this is not intuitive knowledge among the a/A population.  Once the Rules are learned, the next step is understanding when and how and to apply them.<br /><br />Make a place for this book.  It is every a/A navigator's best friend when it comes to improving social skills and interpreting human behavior.  It is a bridge from the a/A population to the NT population and moves all, a/A and NT readers alike onto neuro-neutral ground.  The information found in this book makes communicating in the NT world so much easier and so much more logical!	2004-12-24

AS is a neurobiological condition that is on the autism spectrum.  People who have AS confront any number of sensory processing and communication issues.  Adam gives good, factual explanations for how and why people with AS run into social road blocks.  The best part of this book is that Adam appears to accept himself and the AS part of himself.  That is what makes this book so outstanding.<br /><br />This book will no doubt prove helpful to adults on the spectrum in helping to approach the subject of being on the a/A (autism/Asperger's) spectrum with NT (neurotypical) relatives, co-workers and other peers.  It is a wonderful introduction to a/A and bridges the chasm between a/A and the NT population.  It brings all readers onto neuro-neutral ground.<br /><br />How I wish I had had this book when I was Adam's age.  How lucky Adam is to know what his \\"undefined differences\\" were at a young age!  This book is definitely worth reading and I can't recommend it highly enough.

In many instances, people on the a/A spectrum have difficulty in understanding metaphors and certain idiomatic expressions.<br /><br />I like the way Anglo, American and Australian expressions are included.  While the suggestion of separating each set of idiomatic phrases and metaphors by country is a good one, that is not to overlook the validity and need for this book.  Even if one's child or anyone else on the a/A spectrum uses phrases from other countries, it speaks to inclusion and cultural awareness.  I think that speaks to having goals for those who would most benefit from this work and it also is a fascinating look at idioms.  It just might make the work of neurotypical (NT) translators lighter; people on the spectrum can consult this book for some of the more ambiguous-sounding expressions.<br /><br />I recommend \\"What Did You Say? What Do You Mean?: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding Metaphors\\" by Welton, et al. and feel the Welton book does a much more thorough job of clarifying idioms and metaphors.<br /><br />All in all, a solid work.	2004-12-20

It is also a fascinating, fresh look at history.<br /><br />I like the way Ledgin explains autism and autism-spectrum behaviors.  To his credit, he recognizes autism as the neurobiological condition that it is and provides examples taken from Jefferson's own life to illustrate the claim Jefferson was on the spectrum.  Autism and its related condition, Asperger's Syndrome affect sensory integration, communication and social skills.  A lack of social intuition is also part of a/A spectrum behaviors.  Ledgin used his son's behavior as an example to show the glaring similarities between the child's behavior and that of the late president.  I found that a very interesting premise that sparked the writing of this book.<br /><br />Many people with autism, adults in particular will feel a bond with Jefferson and find that having a place on the a/A spectrum is not a stigmatizing life sentence.  While autism presents a series of major challenges, it does not mean individuals who have it are incapable of major accomplishments, professionally, romantically and even socially.<br /><br />Autism consists of compensations.  One major example given is Jefferson's mastery of the written language.  He was not a noted speaker, but his extraordinary writing skills more than made up for that.  He also appeared to celebrate and embrace his own individuality and recognize this as an important part of himself.  That is what celebrating the Autism Experience is all about.<br /><br />Ledgin has served multi-purposes with this book.  It is well researched and documented.  Ledgin also looks at Jefferson from a very different perspective and provides a bird's eye view of autism in his explanations and descriptions of spectrum behaviors.<br /><br />And yeah, he masterfully instills pride in readers with autism who come across this book.	2004-12-19

Autism and Asperger's are neurobiological conditions that affect sensory processing; communication and often impede social development.  The very suggestion that the a/A spectrum is a disease is just not true and is patently ludicrous.<br /><br />While I can't give this work a ringing endorsement, I can say that if it has helped others, particularly in intrafamilial relationships understand what people on the autism spectrum contend with, then it has served a good purpose.	2004-12-19

To say I truly love this book would be a vast understatement.  Instead of presenting one theory or the \\"Procrustean Bed\\" approach of painfully forcing people to support a certain finding, this book provides a myriad of insights into autism among women.<br /><br />I am good and tired of the Rain Man stereotype that protrays people with autism has having savant abilities and no viable social skills; I am equally tired of the \\"rocking and staring\\" stereotype of autism as well.  Sadly, stereotypes are so often applied to any population and this book unfortunately has passages wherein other groups are painted with the Stereotyping Brush.  That is the only drawback.<br /><br />Since this book contains a myriad of descriptions, it provides the much needed service of explaining that autism and its related neurobiological condition Asperger's is as unique as there are individuals who are on the spectrum.  As  the NT (neurotypical) population recognizes and claims individuality, the same applies among the a/A population.<br /><br />How wonderful to find a book by people with autism about people with autism.  This is the only work I am currently aware of that is concentrated on women who have autism.  The fact that the authors come from all walks of life is representative of the multi-cultural/multi-ethnic world we all, as people live in is a very powerful statement.  Autism does not discriminate.<br /><br />I also like the way the authors describe their individual needs in coping with a largely NT world; the voice for accessibility can be seen, heard and felt throughout this work.  The authors are not reluctant to challenge stereotypes and make individual claims describing how they are personally affected by having autism.<br /><br />What makes this book so unique is that it is connects feminism and autism.  NT issues are also addressed in this work as well.  At no time did I feel these roads diverged; rather I felt the NT and a/A road converged frequently throughout this book.<br /><br />A wide range of issues are discussed such as the spiritual aspects of people's lives; their core values and beliefs; their work experiences; things they do on a routine basis.  Indeed, it is just this wide range that speaks even more to the diversity of the Autism Experience and encourage people to celebrate that part of their lives.  Readers will come away wanting to wave the Autism Banner with Pride!<br /><br />This book is a masterpiece.  Like the Autism Ribbon made up of multi-colored, interlocking pieces, this book puts together a beautiful mosiac of the Autism Experience among a diverse group of women.  The image as a whole, prose and poetry combined with each individual voice makes for a very unique work of art.<br /><br />This book is for everybody.  NT readers will come away with a greater understanding and appreciation for autism; readers on the a/A spectrum will feel this book speaks to some aspects of their lives.  It contains a fresh set of perspectives about human lives and how autism is a part of those lives and not the sole focus.  This is a book I'll keep banging on the drum for because I think the messages it imparts need to be heard by all, and not just the seemingly intended audience.<br /><br />A good companion book to this one is [[ASIN:193256540X Asperger's and Girls]]<br /><br />This is certainly a book that will leave readers deep in thought for a very long time.k.<br /><br />A wide range of issues are discussed such as the spiritual aspects of people's lives; their core values and beliefs; their work experiences; things they do on a routine basis.

I like the way she breaks down behaviors; describes possible triggers and offers reasonable, practical approaches to responding to socially unacceptable behaviors.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary work that deserves a place of honor among professionals.  I like the way she discusses other conditions and ways to provide accessibility.<br /><br />The only thing I admit I didn't like was the word perseverate. That is a highly charged and extremely damaging/judgmental word that many people find offensive.  While many professionals and other \\"neurotypical\\" people use it as a short hand or descriptor, it is still a very negative, stigmatizing word.<br /><br />One thing that is so readily apparent about autism is that it is chiefly a sensory condition.  Autism is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing and in some cases sensory integration; in very rare instances \\"linked\\" senses or synesthesia, i.e. \\"seeing music,\\" \\"tasting words\\" and \\"hearing colors.\\"  Since autism is so plainly rooted in the senses and expressed in sensory terms, it is patently ridiculous to wonder if people with autism feel things.

Adam, the younger brother has concerns about Jeremy.  Jeremy is one year older than Adam and is partially mainstreamed in the local school the boys attend.  Jeremy's social development is quite delayed and his behavior is described as having autistic overtones.  He is also behind his peers academically.<br /><br />Adam sometimes finds Jeremy's behavior embarrassing, such as when Jeremy pitched a fit in a restaurant after Adam did well in a baseball game.  One can feel Adam's justifiable resentment and shame and also Jeremy's anguish at not being able to fit in with his peers.<br /><br />One child accepts Jeremy.  Tommy, a 3rd-grader in the neighborhood, looks up to Jeremy and the pair enjoy imaginative role playing (not a behavior readily found on the autism spectrum); joking and sharing a love for gardening.  Jeremy is also a Beatles' fan, which I think speaks to excellent taste and cultural appreciation.<br /><br />Tommy sounded like he was good for Jeremy and I was really disgusted with Jeremy's mother for threatening to punish him for playing with a younger child.  Tommy was the one person who accepted Jeremy and enjoyed him, so I think it would have been beneficial to all to allow those boys to enjoy their friendship.  I thought it was a good thing that Jeremy did not obey this draconian edict and continued his friendship with Tommy.<br /><br />Adam is having problems with a boy on his team.  Eddie, a rather rough boy takes his anger out on his peers.  Unable to confront his abusive father, Eddie makes baseball a blood sport.  Eddie also creates other havoc and it is up to Adam to go to bat for Jeremy when Jeremy is being charged with vandalism.<br /><br />In the end, fraternal love proves strong and will leave readers cheering and rooting for the Krasner Brothers, the baseball fan and the Beatle fan.	2004-12-16

Autism and its related condition, Asperger's Syndrome are neurobiolgical conditions that affect sensory processing and communication.  The range is as great as there are people on the a/A spectrum and there are often overlapping behaviors.<br /><br />People with Asperger's, or the \\"milder\\" form of autism often have special interests.  These interests are often referred to as \\"obsessions\\" by the neurotypical population.  The term \\"special interests\\" is much kinder and much more apt.  In most cases, people who live or work with people who have special interests understandably try to limit the amount of time the person spends on the special interests.  This is a rather stop-gap approach because it merely meets the needs of the neurotypical population and denies the person on the autism spectrum that much needed pleasure and release.<br /><br />I love the way this book encourages professionals and other interested persons to use special interests to engage people on the spectrum.  This is a very effective teaching method and will pay dividends.	2004-12-16

Instead of lamenting over people who have autism and applying the tired Rain Man stereotype, this book encourages people, neurotypical and autistic alike to celebrate in the Autism Experience.  The lovely photograhphs help to reinforce this message.  Readers look at the people directly involved and see people and not labels.  I really like that.<br /><br />Autism and its related condition, Asperger's Syndrome are neurobiological conditions that affect sensory processing and communication.  Autism is as varied as there are individuals and the behavior reflects that individuality.  I like the way this book gently illustrates that and invites readers to sing and dance in victory, celebrating the Autism Experience!<br /><br />Please read this with [[ASIN:1843108372 Autism Heroes: Portraits of Families Meeting the Challenge]] and share these books with someone.

The handwritten font was the least of my objections regarding this work.  It is easy to see where and how the pictures could cause some confusion.  One of the challenges many people on the autism spectrum have is being able to decode facial expressions.<br /><br />My chief complaint about this book is the title.  I think the 1988 movie \\"Rain Man\\" has done more to reinforce stereotypes about autism than it ever did to foster understanding.  The term \\"Rain Man\\" is considered highly offensive in many autism/Asperger's circles and is best avoided.<br /><br />I am good and tired of people with autism being portrayed as rocking; staring fixedly at something; spinning objects or watching anything that rotates; demonstrating savant abilities and having no viable social skills.  That stereotypical behavior simply does not apply to the entire autistic population.  Savantism applies to roughly a little less than 10% of the autistic population.  Autism is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing and communication.  The range and variations are as great as there are individuals with autism.  Seriously, I rue the release of the movie \\"Rain Man\\" and sincerely hope the term and image of \\"Rain Man\\" will not be so liberally applied to people with autism.  That hurts all and helps no one.<br /><br />I didn't think this one was helpful at all and would recommend \\"Autism Through a Sister's Eyes,\\" \\"All About My Brother,\\" \\"Views From Our Shoes: Growing Up With a Brother or Sister With Special Needs,\\" \\"Ian's Walk\\" and \\"My Brother Kevin Has Autism\\" instead.  These are excellent books that explore sibling issues and foster understanding and acceptance of autism.<br /><br />If this book helped others understand the underlying rationale for behaviors associated with the condition and provided understanding, that is to the good.	2004-12-16

His \\"carrot minus the stick\\" approach in helping people on the autism spectrum perceive benefits in social interaction is an invaluable insight.  I like the way he concentrates on building strengths and providing explanations for more severe autism-spectrum behaviors.<br /><br />He uses what appears to me a very reasonable approach.  For many people with autism, sequencing or breaking tasks and interactions down into process-friendly steps has proven helpful.  He also explains how people by nature crave socialization and that people on the autism spectrum do not have the intuitive social knowledge, such as how long and when to maintain eye contact.  To his credit, he does not lapse into a tired \\"Rain Man\\" stereotype; instead, he focuses on how to encourage people with autism to develop nonverbal as well as other interpersonal social skills.  In just about every case, people with autism learn these behaviors cognitively and often by repeated efforts.<br /><br />This book certainly deserves a place of honor among professionals and families.  It is for everybody.	2004-12-16

She naturally wants to know why she cannot communicate with him consistently and what prompts him to behave and respond as he does.  Emily's parents acknowledge Emily's anger, concern and other feelings and allow her to explore.  I like the conversations they had.  I also like the way Daniel is accepted and how some of his more outlandish behavior is explained and not condoned.  Reasonable expectations are set for Daniel, always with the hope of contant, continued improvement.<br /><br />The dynamics among this family are what makes this book so strong.

Autism, which is a neurobiological condition is often called an \\"invisible\\" one in that many people with it display no physical needs.  Sensory processing and communication are the spheres most noticeably affected by autism; challenges in social skills are also part of the package.<br /><br />I like the way Louis' very wise, astute teacher explains to the other children why Louis responds and behaves as he does.  She makes it clear that although the same behavior would not be acceptable from the other children, certain allowances have to be made in order to meet the boy's needs.  At no time is any child short-shrifted; at no time is any child's natural curiosity about Louis' behavior hushed up or criticized.  Instead, Miss Owlie provides a round table where the children can explore their own feelings and come to a better understanding of Louis and be more accepting people as well.<br /><br />Another excellent book exploring this topic is Andreanna Edwards' \\"Taking Autism to School,\\" which is a wonderful story about inclusion.<br /><br />I can't recommend this one highly enough.  It gently reinforces the precept that we are our brother's keeper.  This book is for everyone!	2004-12-16

Betsy's mother said that Betsy developed and spoke within normal limits until she was a year old.<br /><br />Betsy's behavior fits the classic profile of Infantile Autism.  She \\"self-stims\\" by rocking, squinting and engaging in other singular motor activities; she does not speak nor interact with anybody.  School personnel tell the girl's mother that they can make no promises and will do what they can to help Betsy adopt more socially appropriate behaviors and self help skills.<br /><br />Brownie, a male beagle mix and a dove are the ones who catch Betsy's attention.  She is first captivated by the dove and by watching this free bird, she begins exploring her surroundings and interacting in small increments.  She initially ignored Brownie, but he was determined to get her to play with him.  In time, she befriends the lovable hound.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like in this book was when the author described autism as \\"a cold gray autistic world.\\"  Not necessarily.  That neurotypical misperception cost this book one star.  For a person with autism, the world is not necessarily bleak.  Autism is a neurobiological condition that impedes communication and social skills to varying degrees, based upon the individual.<br /><br />By the book's end, Betsy finds her way of soaring.  To the author's credit, Betsy is not miraculously cured.	2004-12-02

Articles that were at one time not as readily accessible outside of the U.K. have been presented in their fresh, crisp form.  The book picks up where the articles left off and includes plenty of bonus material that covers the pre-Beatle era, e.g. the days of John Lennon's group, the Quarrymen, the precursor group to the Beatles.  Inclusion of material about early musical influences such as Elvis and Buddy Holly are given good coverage as well.<br /><br />What makes this book stand out from so many others is the myriad of articles and personal perspectives about the Beatles, their work and their cultural influence.  This work treats the subject with in-depth reporting ranging from the humorous, light-reporting of \\"trivia\\" to the more serious issues about the Beatles themselves.<br /><br />I like the way individuals who had previously received little coverage are honored and recognized.  A good example of this is Raymond Jones, the man who encouraged Beatles' manager Brian Epstein to check out their work.<br /><br />Another aspect that I really like is the way a Beatle chonology is given of activities, concerts, recordings and song releases.  This is the book every Beatle fan must have!<br /><br />This is such an exceptionally high caliber work.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2004-10-23

Huntley does a good job in covering the life, art and times of former Beatle George Harrison.<br /><br />The youngest Beatle who was often reported as a man who cherished his privacy would probably endorse this book wholeheartedly.  The writing remains general and objective and the author appears to view George with respect.<br /><br />I think this is a work people ranging in mild interest in the Beatles to avid, inveterate fans will enjoy this book and think about it long after having read it to the finish.	2004-09-30

A former executive, she married Ned Jensen, a free lance artist whom she met in the mid-1980s while still a graduate student.  She shared an interest in art with Ned, which led to a lasting relationship.<br /><br />Their daughter, Kate, was conceived prior to their marriage and Rachel's mother, whom I found domineering and annoying did everything possible to try to control the young couple's lives.  The Jensens moved from New York to rural North Hawthorne, New Hampshire so Ned could continue with his art and they could raise Kate in a small town.<br /><br />In late 2001, Rachel joyfully discovers she is pregnant again.  Saddened over Kate's deteriorating behavior, Rachel views the new baby as a hopeful promise.  She and Ned hold off on telling Kate and plan on telling her together, but Rachel's mother upsets that apple cart as well.  I didn't like the way Rachel's mother snooped each time she vistited her daughter and son-in-law; I didn't like the way she bossed Rachel around even after Rachel was herself a mother!  I actually cheered when Rachel said to Ned, \\"Call a cab for my mother.  She's leaving now,\\" and Ned responding by saying he would drive her to the airport himself.<br /><br />More unrest with Kate ensues.  She witnesses the birth of her brother, Joshua and is traumatized when she believes Rachel's life is on the line.  An ugly scene with Ned ensues and Kate flees into the night.  More problems with her crop up and a devastating accident Kate has while caring for her brother send her into a tail spin.<br /><br />A devastating series of accusations throughout the Jensen family take place and the family becomes an armed camp.  Instead of the cheerful portraits Ned painted and photographs that grace their home, the Jensens become militants, armed against Kate.  As her behavior deteriorates further, she is forcibly enrolled in a secure facility.<br /><br />No promises are made and this book is not a \\"quick fix, feel good\\" formulaic series of plots and ending.  Instead, it is a good hard look at actions, consequences and the very real no man's land of questions without answers.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book and would happily read more works by this author.  I also like the book list included at the back of this book and Dani Shapiro now has me as an avid follower.is not a \\"quick fix, feel good\\" formulaic series of plots and ending.

This book is composed of essays by university students who provide personal accounts of what living with autism/Asperger's means and how they have coped and made giant steps forward.<br /><br />I like the passage about synesthesia, that is linked sensory  modes.  One contributor explains how numbers and letters have colors; henceforth the title \\"Aquamarine Blue 5.\\"  She explains how certain sounds can have colors; this sensory condition has until very recently received little press.<br /><br />Synesthesia can take on many forms.  For certain people on the a/A spectrum, synesthesia is part of the sensory package.  Some people can taste and smell certain words; colors can have an auditory component and in some cases, people have reported being able to see music.<br /><br />How I wish I had this book when I was a university student!  This sterling gem of a book helps clarify so much of what the Autism/Asperger's experience is all about for so many people.<br /><br />I wish I could rate this one even more stars.

The Beatle Box Set is a must have for all Beatles' fans and anybody with an interest in the Beatles. Clayson does intense, in-depth reporting on each Beatle and offers many interesting facts and fresh information. He provides footnotes for his sources and his work is indeed scholarly and impressive.<br /><br /> I like the way he focusses on each Beatle individually and how each Beatle's life circumstances helped create the unique, distinct and very individual style that each one had. One gets a &quot;sense&quot; of each Beatle; Clayson does an admirable job of covering cultural/musical as well as other influences each Beatle said impacted on his life and music.	2004-07-26

This has been one of my favorite books for many years.<br /><br /> She juxtaposes prominent events of the Sixties with her own developmental milestones and personal observations. Her descriptions of her home town in New Hampshire and the businesses and history, e.g. using all 7 digits for local calls as opposed to only dialing 4 add a touch of Americana and a sense of history. Her rich descriptions of people in the community and the town's history also make this a very effective work.<br /><br /> I found the way she wrote of herself very interesting and ironic. A veteran reporter from an early age, Maynard, when writing of herself appears to take a somewhat impersonal tone for the most part. This \\"impersonal\\" voice when speaking of oneself and chronicling developmental points in their lives contrasts with the rich descriptions of other people and events that were taking place. Maynard's discussion of then-popular TV shows and the prevailing attitudes toward same offer yet another view of the Sixties; her synopses of certain shows and the conclusions she later drew paint a vivid picture of the era in very bold strokes, much like an anthropologist or sociologist studying the customs, mores and folkways of an era.<br /><br /> This is an outstanding book and I highly recommend it.	2004-07-26

Many of the children who had a place at this table had parents who were in jail or were deemed legally unable to care for them.  Each child came equipped with major emotional baggage.<br />The love and acceptance and diligent, dogged efforts on behalf of each child in this home have indeed raised the bar.  Instead of being a stark and grim account akin to Dickens, this work instead is uplifting and hopeful.  One can only feel that each child who found a place at this table was very fortunate indeed.<br />This is a book that belongs on our collective bookshelves; in our collective hearts and libraries.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.	2004-06-17

She remains cold and indifferent to her son Kevin who was born on April 11, 1983. Her treatment of Kevin was deplorable.<br /><br />Problems with Kevin are evident from the start. He insists on wearing diapers until he is six; he willfully destroys property and has no attachments to any object or person. He does not play with toys and shows no interest in initiating interactions. Why this child was not in therapy remains a mystery to me. After all, Eva could afford it.<br /><br />Eva's long suffering husband Franklin tries to take logic where it had never been with Eva. He chided her for blaming Kevin for everything that went wrong in their home and in Kevin's class; he rightfully challenged her by saying, \\"Kevin doesn't play right, meaning the way YOU did. He doesn't treat the toys YOU make him like museum pieces. He doesn't pat YOU on the back every time he learns to spell a new word.\\" Way to go, Franklin! I thought he was right.<br /><br />I did not like Eva or her teaching methods, which I found vain and self serving. I also thought it served her right that Kevin learned to read and count and add in secret without her. Her comment about \\"never being treated to a 'Eureka!' moment\\" of witnessing the child learn something she taught sounded very self serving indeed. I also felt it served her right when Kevin destroyed and disposed of her handmade toys. All of her efforts hollered, \\"Look at how good I am. I make an effort by making him toys. I try to teach him basic skills and it turns out he already knew them.\\" It was all about her and Kevin, as Franklin rightfully pointed out never once entered in. Her efforts were really for herself and not for Kevin.<br /><br />There were several discrepancies in the book. One journal entry dated November 8, 2000 was heralded as \\"one year and eight months to the day\\" after Kevin's final acts of cruelty when in fact it was \\"one year and seven months to the day.\\" Early in the book, Eva calls Franklin \\"Jim\\" and that was never explained. Eva breaks Kevin's right arm in July of 1989 after he went on a major soiling campaign and a few pages later, Kevin, still cast-bound catches a ball with his \\"good right hand.\\" That was the one she broke! I thought it was disgraceful that she was never held accountable for breaking her son's arm.<br /><br />Another mistake was about Luke Woodham, the boy who killed his own mother prior to going on a shooting ramapage at his high school in 1997.  Woodham had a female dog named Sparkle whom he tortured to death.  In this book, Sparkle was misidentified as \\"Sparky\\" and was referred to as a male dog.  That was inaccurate.<br /><br />Several things bothered me, including Kevin's covering for Eva when she broke his arm. When he is rushed to the hospital, he insists that Eva wait outside for him. I have never heard of any hospital that would treat a child without a parent or other responsible adult being present. I never understood why Eva, upset with Kevin for allegedly enticing a kindergarten classmate to scratch her eczema encrusted skin never questioned him or the other child directly. I was also baffled as to why the teacher did not question both children about what Kevin was whispering to the other child before she scratched herself. Why Franklin, understandably upset with Eva for accusing Kevin of \\"seducing\\" and \\"enticing\\" the other child into scratching herself never asked Kevin about the incident sounded equally remiss to me. At that time, Kevin was a child in kindergarten, not Svengali! I think Eva was a singularly atrocious parent.  She also impressed me as a phony, wanting to \\"walk briskly and talk in low adult tones\\" and \\"play grown up\\" in her new study.  Eva was all brisk, military metaphors and was a completely unlikable character.<br /><br />Since Kevin did not enjoy having down time and Eva admitted that he needed to have his minutes regimented, why not enroll him in a summer camp program?  That would have at least been an effort at helping him develop social skills and would have provided him with a routine.<br /><br />I also didn't understand why neither parent asked local sitters why they refused to watch Kevin a second time or ask the neighborhood mothers why they created a play group deliberately excluding Kevin.<br /><br />When Kevin's sister Celia was born on June 14, 1991, he stepped up his malicious behavior. He ties her to her booster seat and forces her to eat inedible concoctions; he binds and gags her in a game of \\"kidnapping.\\" Celia was foolish, clingy and fatuously docile to a fault. Eva even contradicts herself by saying that stupid Celia was \\"not an outright masochist\\" upon finding Celia victimized by Kevin's idea of \\"playing.\\"  Celia sure sounded masochistic to me!  Why neither parent protected her more is anybody's good guess.  Eva, never at a loss for military metaphors equates Celia to \\"a trusting young girl as a military ally\\" is \\"worse than useless.\\"<br /><br />Eva does some remarkably stupid things like buying Celia an elephant shrew for Christmas.  She admits that she bought the pet \\"as much for herself\\" as her silly daughter and that she knew \\"an unhappy ending for the animal was inevitable.\\"  Why buy that foolish girl an exotic pet in the first place?  Why not buy her a turtle which at least has much more durability!<br /><br />Celia was a literary foil in that her character was the polar opposite of Kevin's.  That sounded very calculated and contrived to me.<br /><br />When Kevin allegedly puts Celia's eye out in February of 1998, I could not understand why Eva would leave her in the same house with Kevin. I thought that was the height of dangerous negligence.  Although I didn't like Celia, I also didn't like Eva's low expectations for the child; \\"Celia was a doormat\\" and one who could count on being exploited by the world at large.  Franklin admittedly did not, as Eva pointed out \\"think Celia was very smart\\" which was understandable.  Celia was racked with a multitude of irrational fears, including the sight of mildew on a shower curtain or moldy yogurt.  Her masochism was just too contrived.  Celia was not an appealing character and it was easy to see why Franklin was annoyed with her and Kevin all but dismissed her.<br /><br /> Kevin's twisted pathology culminates in devastating acts of cruelty and violence on April 8, 1999.

This work traces George Harrison's life from his youth in Liverpool to his meteoric rise in fame as a musician and his tragic demise in 2001.  People who knew George Harrison as well as the backdrop of events and issues of the times are richly expounded upon, thus making this work exceptional.<br />I like the way many details are included in this work because it gives readers a multi-faceted look at the man who would set new standards among lyricists and guitarists.  This unique individual, George Harrison stood out among his peers including the other Beatles.  Clayson does him justice in portraying him in his natural state.  He has a rich supply of sources and is able to account for each documentation.  I really like the chapter Clayson included about George's 1963 trip to America to visit his sister, brother-in-law and their children.  The impact the young Beatle had on the people he met in Benton, Illinois is well chronicled in this work.<br />This is work well worth the read and I am the proud owner of it.

Instead of focussing on the former Beatle's achievements and accomplishments, it appears that this author is criticizing and scorning other artists such as Eric Clapton.<br />The irony of it all is that Clayson has written a biography that was of extraordinary caliber on George Harrison, the 1/4 of the box set.  This work, on the other hand is a real bust.	2004-05-10

The one thing I take issue with is the high-functioning person with autism or its closely related spectrum condition Asperger's as not having autistic symptoms.  That is a question that remains to be proven and mere behaviorism does not explain autism.<br />As an inveterate, lifelong Beatles' fan, I had to smile when I read about Andrew, the brilliant young boy with Asperger's who had an avid love for the world's Number One Band.  A gifted artist, Andrew would draw the Beatles at different points in their careers and kept abreast of any news relating to them.  I like the way he was able to use his vast knowledge of the Beatles as an entree to conversation - how well I understood that!  Asperger's and Beatles - two specialized areas that I have a vast amount of knowledge of myself.  I love the way the authors say that because of Andrew, they listen to the Beatles and appreciate them all the more.  How well I understood that!<br />I would have rated this 3 stars, but the description of how the Beatles played and continue to play an important part in the life of a young boy on the spectrum raises this to 4.	2004-05-05

She has a twin brother named Noble (sounds more like a lion's name or a winning race horse's name than a boy's), a controlling, manipulative  and obviously mentally ill mother who has a lot of New Age superstitions and a father who is the only likeable character in the book.  He doesn't have a backbone, but he is at least likable.<br /><br />The children are home schooled; they are taught to believe their dead relatives appear to them in spirit form and that they can communicate with them.  Their mother buys them amulets and insists that they and their father wear them as well.  The household is more like a cult.  Arthur, the children's father is the one voice of reason.  He tries to convince his crazy wife to let the children mix with other kids and to develop social skills, all to no avail.<br /><br />Arthur joins many other VC Andrews/Andrew Neiderman parents in death by automobile accident.  That's a quick and easy way to finish a character off.  After Arthur's untimely death which his widow taxes on his refusal to wear his amulet, she isolates the children further.  To make matters worse, Noble breaks his leg at 9 and is not allowed to go to the hospital.  Instead, he is treated at home with a home made cast and Celeste is blamed for every jam her brother gets into.  She is also brighter than Noble which their mother resents.  She wants Noble to have all the mental endowments and advantages.<br /><br />Add to it Noble's untimely demise in a fishing accident.  Naturally Celeste is blamed and to make a stupid story macabre, morbid and sick, their mother buries Noble in Celeste's clothes and forces Celeste to take on Noble's role.  Her hair is cropped; she is forced to wear her brother's clothes and act as much like Noble as possible.  All photographs and objects belonging to Celeste are buried.  Her mother lives in a state of constant denial, even when Celeste is raped by a neighboring boy and becomes pregnant.  Even after the baby is born, Celeste is forced to be her daughter's &#34;big brother.&#34;  I didn't like that crazy mother at all and her punishments of starving and locking up the children and following nonexistent voices repelled me.<br /><br />I also don't like the way many of Andrew Neiderman as VCA's characters call their mothers &#34;mommy,&#34; which sounds very babyish.<br /><br />I didn't like this book at all.  The sequel could ONLY be better, which isn't hard to do.  I'm not overly optimistic about that.  Naturally, anything with the name &#34;V.C. Andrews&#34; and an attention grabbing cover will attract readers for any number of reasons and the cliff hanger endings will keep readers wondering what happens to the weird cast of characters.  Good marketing skills.  I would not wish this book on anyone and it is just literary junk food suitable for reading on a long plane trip.a neighboring boy and becomes pregnant.

It is written in a plain, straight-forward style that clearly describes the behaviors that are often associated with a/A.  I like the way the authors don't make light of meltdowns and explain what often triggers them.  I also like the straight-forward direct approach they take in helping others cope with, and, in cowpoke parlance, head meltdowns off at the pass.

Although I found the love between Linda and Paul lovely and highly moving, I was displeased to see how harshly John was described.  It was like a yin-yang balance - the tone used in describing Paul was one of fawning deference and on the other hand, John was described in an almost condemnatory fashion.  I didn't like that.<br />On the plus side, the lighter moments such as Paul and Linda's trips to New York were cheery and loving.  I also enjoyed reading about the final Beatle movie, &quot;Let It Be&quot; which is more or less a chronicle of the dissolution of the group.<br />I found this work to be mediocre.	2004-04-07

It is indeed as is noted in the editorial reviews a rough-hewn and crudely carved sequel of &#34;The Other Side of Midnight.&#34;  Sheldon does not deviate from the routine trashy forumla replete with cliche bedroom scenes and a plethora of ruthless characters.<br /><br />Set in the late 1940s right after WWII, Catherine, wife of pilot Larry whom readers first encountered in &#34;The Other Side of Midnight&#34; regains her memory.  She remembers how cruel Larry was to her and how he jilted her for his mistress, Noelle Page.  Indeed, Noelle was the kept mistress of one Constantin Demiris who was written to sound like an ersatz Ari Onasis.  Demiris, like a magician can make those in his disfavor disappear.  Exit Larry and Noelle in the first installment.<br /><br />In this book, Catherine, the long-lost heroine is restored to glory and is swept off her feet by a man who is loosely based on the cliche Cavalry men.<br /><br />A psychiatrist and an eclectic mix of patients are thrown into this story; just how they are directly tied into the main plot has never been addressed.  One character who is clearly written as an autistic savant displays some of the more prominent autistic behaviors.  He is echolalic; he recites long chains of information and he knows the number and type of vehicles he passes in route to the doctor's office.  His activities are solitary and few; he does not voluntarily interact with others.  I am really tired of stories like this that portray characters with autism as automaton-like savants with isolated abilities that are far removed from the social world. That is bad enough, but I just hated it when Catherine wondered if the man could actually have feelings.  That is a very dehumanizing fallacy about autism.  I think stories like this do a grave disservice to those with autism and for others who come across autistic characters because it is just perpetuating a stereotype.<br /><br />This book does not really contain much of a mystery.  It's just ruthless people getting even with each other.  Even good old Demiris' wife Melina enters this story after having been relegated to shadow figure status in the original.  Same old fare.<br /><br />An attorney who was directly involved in a trial engineered by Demiris re-enters the picture.  Some fancy manuevering, and he runs away with the show.  Literally.mystery.

Asperger's is a sensorineuro condition that is on the spectrum with autism and is often regarded as high functioning autism.  Since Asperger's IS on the spectrum, there are behaviors and sensory responses that overlap.  As with any condition, autism and Asperger's are as varied as there are individuals who have it.<br />Although Chris does not have language delays or other cognitive issues, he DOES present sensory and social difficulties.  He cannot stand to have his food touching other foods on his plate; he is rigid about giving his EXACT age; (\\"I'm 15 and 3 months and 3 days\\"); he is gifted in mathematics and has a far reaching knowledge of prime numbers and mathematical properties; he has trouble interpeting nonverbal cues, e.g. facial expressions as well as verbal cues such as tones of voice.  His social challenges are what he feels set him apart more than his natural intellectual and academic gifts.<br />Chris is also a problem solver.  When a neighbor's beloved poodle is found killed and Chris finds the animal's remains, he vows to find the REAL killer.  A neighbor places Chris at the top of her short list of suspects and the boy is later taken into custody.  Agains the wishes and advice of parents and other concerned parties, Chris pulls the mask off of the real dog killer.<br />I love this book.  I am so delighted to see a book told from the autism/Asperger's point of view.  I am good and tired of stories like \\"Rain Man\\" that portray characters with autism as echolalic stereotypes who have concentrated areas of knowledge and no viable social skills.  I want more stories like this; Chris is a delightful, appealing and VERY plausible character.  Readers who are on the spectrum will certainly feel a literary bond to Chris.  Readers who are closely involved with people on the spectrum most likely will be captivated by the appealing boy with the resourcefulness to think of novel approaches.<br />Hats off to this book!f novel approaches.<br />Hats off to this book!	2004-03-05

Her connection to Dr. Delaware  other than a heated verbal exchange is that his then live in love Robin built a guitar for her.<br />Several more people are murdered - a ballerina in Boston; a musician in Southern California; a homeless woman and possibly others.  A young writer whose whereabouts cannot be accounted for seems a likely suspect; his e-magazine is rife with nihilism and 1980s style punk fueled venom some 20 years later.  Delaware, his friend LAPD Homicide Detective Milo Sturgis and two Sturgis' colleagues, Petra Connor and Eric Stahl make for a very unlikely quartet indeed.<br />The quartet work in separately and in pairs (Delaware/Sturgis and Connor/Stahl) tracking down all possible leads.  What if any connection could there possibly be to a homeless woman and a group of artists living in different parts of the United States?  The e-magazine leads the sleuths to a small private university where its creator graduated; a trip to the university fails to uncover any possible leads or links.<br />Who killed these people and why?  Once again, Jon Kellerman has presented a masterpiece of a mystery with plenty of plot twists to keep readers riveted.  His use of names and descriptions is clever; for example, a minor character aptly named Christian BANGSley is described as &quot;Beatle mopped.&quot;  I loved that.  I also liked Dr. Delaware's new girlfriend Allison.  Robin more or less was relegated to a minor role and I didn't like it when she tried to seduce Dr. Delaware when he came to see how she was doing.  I also found it interesting that Robin wound up with the French bulldog she and Alex Delaware had owned.  I still don't care for Robin.<br />I loved Elizabeth Martin, the brilliant department chair at the mysterious Charter College.  A committed academic, she is interesting and believable and I really found her to be a strong character who made a good story even better.ved Elizabeth Martin, the brilliant department chair at the mysterious Charter College.

By her own account, she had an \\"atheist epiphany\\" while reading the Bible at age 12 or 13 wherein she dismissed it as being implausible and declared herself to be an atheist to the world at large.  In yet another stroke of irony, O'Hair enrolled at Ashland College where chapel was mandatory.  She graduated in 1948.<br /><br />At that time she moved to Texas from her native Ohio and enrolled in law school.  She graduated with a law degree in 1952, but failed the Bar exam.  She by then had a son out of wedlock named William Joseph Murray III.  He was born on May 26, 1946.<br /><br />In 1954, she had a second son whom she named Jon Garth.  She never identified Jon's father by name, but described him in extremely bawdy terms.  She raised both sons to be atheists and on October 12, 1960 she was irate when her older son's principal told her that all pupils had mandatory prayers in school each morning.  By November 2, 1960 her older son publicly refused to pray.<br /><br />William seemed destined to follow the atheistic path laid out for him and in early 1964 he married a woman from a Jewish family.  Naturally that did not sit well with Madalyn Murray O'Hair and marital discord soon ensued.  The discord escalated to domestic abuse.  When Madalyn's only grandchild, Robin, was born on February 16, 1965 her son's marriage was more or less over.<br /><br />During 1964-1965 the O'Hairs moved frequently.  William was arrested in 1964 because his wife Susan was under the legal age for marriage.  Madalyn Murray O'Hair fought with the arresting officers and she herself faced charges.  On May 26, 1964 William's father-in-law filed criminal charges against him.  The irony of William's being busted on his birthday was not lost on the irate Madalyn Murray O'Hair.  It was during this period that she was described as one who \\"craved to induce chaos.\\"<br /><br />Shortly after his release, William, his wife, brother and mother fled to Hawaii where Madalyn found her niche there on Atheist Radio, spewing out her inflammatory brand of atheism.  The program prided itself on granting \\"free time to opposing viewpoints\\" under the Fairness Doctrine.  By August of 1964 the O'Hairs were extradited to Maryland.<br /><br />By early 1965, O'Hair had found an offshoot to express her atheism.  She became involved with a Reverend Rhinehart who was an avid mystic.  In May of 1965 she flew to San Francisco to dodge law enforcement and by that summer was involved in the disastrous Blake College project.  By August of 1965, her older son bought an exit letter to leave Mexico where he was then staying.  O'Hair was busted during this period and was sent to San Antonio, Texas and was later extradited to Maryland.  She served 31 days and was released by an atheist judge.  On October 22, 1965 the charges against O'Hair were dropped.<br /><br />On November 6, 1967 she appeared on the popular talk show hosted by Phil Donahue.  She became infamous for her liberal use of expletives, blasphemy and invectives.  During commercial breaks, she shocked the audience with her incindiary diatribes against religion.<br /><br />A shrewd person, O'Hair had managed to convince a number of people to will all of their worldly possessions to her.  Larry Flynt, an infamous porn mogul described her as being the most brilliant person he knew and gave her $300 million.<br /><br />In yet another stroke of irony, O'Hair's oldest son had a religious epiphany and became a Christian in the 1970s.  He claimed to have had a vision of an Angel with a sword and Bible.  In 1982 he wrote a book about his road to Christianity.  Jon, however, remained an atheist.  Ironically, Robin remained an atheist as well.<br /><br />On February 2, 1993 a David Waters answered an ad in a Texas newspaper for a job as office manager of the Atheist Headquarters.  A man with a criminal background, Waters allegedly skimmed funds and O'Hair's son Jon received a New York bank notice that $70,000.00 bearer bonds had been issued, but were missing.  By March of 1994 all of the Headquarter's accounts were liquidated and Jon tracked a trail of forged checks Waters had cashed.<br /><br />The last known photograph of O'Hair was taken on August 11, 1995 and a notice was sent throughout the Atheist community that O'Hair would return on September 15.  For three years the Atheist community claimed O'Hair was returning.  Legal authorities felt differently and on October 2, 1998 an auction was held in the O'Hair home in Austin, Texas.  Diaries Madalyn Murray O'Hair had written from 1959-72 were found.  A series of diaries covering the 1989-95 period were missing and on January 31, 1999 an IRS auction was held to conclude the dispersal of her possessions.<br /><br />O'Hair, son Jon and granddaughter Robin were found on January 27, 2001, charred in a field.  David Waters was sentenced for their murders on March 30, 2001.<br /><br />As a Christian, I could not support O'Hair or anything she stood for.

Any book with the V.C. Andrews name and requisite attention-grabbing cover picture is sure to rack up sales.  V. C. Andrews books are good for reading on a long plane trip.  Still, I would not recommend them.<br />Robin - an Ohio girl whose country-singing mother uproots her from her grandparents' farm and pursues her Grand Ole Opry dream.  Robin falls in with a bad crowd, robs a store and is busted.<br />Teal - a poor little rich girl in upstate New York who is neglected in her own home steals a piece of jewelry worth over $10,000.00 and runs away with a boy who lives in poverty with two younger siblings.  She has a history of drinking in school.<br />Phoebe -  an Atlanta girl whose mother leaves home to pursue a singing career and whose salesman father can't be home to raise her.  Turned over to a punitive maternal aunt and disinterested uncle, Phoebe becomes out of control.  She is caught sleeping with a boy in the school nurse's office.  She is busted when she attacks that same boy at a party where she was set up by a pair of vile, catty girls.<br />Each of the girls is drugged and transported by plane to an undisclosed school after their guardians are convinced the girls need to be in a supervised setting.  A Dodge car picks Robin up and transports her to a small plane where she will be flown to this mysterious school.  Teal is taken by family limo to the plane.  Phoebe is subdued by guards driving an ambulance where she was drugged after the guard says she is having a seizure to ward off curious onlookers.  She is the only one to arrive by ambulance to the mystery plane.<br />Each girl awakens to find herself the sole passenger on a plane bound for Arizona.  Each girl awakens to find herself dressed in a rough burlap sack, diapers, work boots and her clothes gone.  Harsh martinets gather the trio into a dark warehouse for their introduction to Dr. Foreman's &quot;school.&quot;  In order to leave the warehouse, the girls have to write about their lives in notebooks under the derision of the guards.  From there, they are transported by bus to the &quot;school&quot; after being indoctrinated by the guards to declare their worthlessness and how they owe everything to Dr. Foreman.  Sounds like a twisted version of the &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; to me.<br />The girls are forced to sleep in the barn; do long chores during the day and fight for what little dignities they are allowed.  Progress is being allowed to wear underwear and overalls instead of diapers (&quot;you are infants and must be treated as such,&quot; is the rationale for this twisted, degrading decision according to Dr. Foreman).  Pillows and blankets have to be earned; food has to be earned; the girls have to make their own pottery or eat off the table.<br />The punishments were inconsistent and implausible and made no sense.  Teal and Robin are bound in blankets and forced to spend the night outdoors in coffins that are partially buried (&quot;bury the bad part of you,&quot; as Dr. Foreman explained.)  The girls' few assignments were random and haphazard; at no time did they attend classes.  Cruel guards and a sinister Dr. Foreman make the place all the more heinous.  Dr. Foreman's &quot;therapy&quot; consists of pitting the girls against each other so that enmity instead of amity will prevail and that she will maintain control over them.  The hateful guards were former students of this bizarre excuse of a school.<br />Only one person befriends the girls.  Natani, a Native American healer lives on the grounds and he does what he can to help the girls.  When the guards plan to leave the girls in the Arizona desert to die, it is Natani who tells them how to survive should they ever be in the desert.<br />A fire and the end of the school mean liberation for the girls.  Two other inmates, Gia and Mandy have become more or less resigned to the punitive, illogical environment they are in.  Gia talks of a former inmate named Posy whom Dr. Foreman insists is a product of Gia's imagination.  Whether or not there was a Posy in that Chamber of Horrors is never explained.  Readers are never sure if Posy was somebody Gia made up or if she was an inmate there.  The Ice Room is another Chamber of Horrors where the inmates endure virtual reality of the things they fear most.  Mandy caves and is subsequently institutionalized and Gia plans a daring escape for them all.<br />V.C. Andrews books are sore disappointments and I certainly cannot in good conscious recommend this one.  I read it because I was curious to see what this undisclosed school was about, but believe me, it wasn't worth it.  Natani was the only likable character in this atrocious book.a talks of a former inmate named Posy whom Dr. Foreman insists is a product of Gia's imagination.

One comes away with a \\"sense\\" of John, the natural and environmental forces that molded and shaped this highly gifted and articulate man.  One can smile at the bright, high-spirited child who reached developmental milestones early and was also an early reader; one can smile at the artistic boy who created complex drawings at a very young age; one cheers for the talented young boy who proved to be quite adept at things musical.<br />Coleman does an admirable job of portraying John's natural parents, half-sisters and the indomitable aunt who raised him in realistic lights; one gets a good sense of how each one of these people influenced John and how his life experiences were expressed by his early experiences.  In a very touching description of John reconnecting with his natural father, one feels John's anguish at having been promised a life with him and denied; one feels John's devastating maternal loss when his natural mother Julia is killed in an accident when John was in his teens.<br />John takes those experiences and fleshes them out musically; his songs \\"Mother\\" and \\"Julia\\" are songs that come straight from his early loss.  His interpersonal relationships with the other Beatles, his first wife Cynthia and their son Julian and his second wife Yoko and their son Sean are fully examined in this work.  John describes the \\"strong women\\" in his immediate family and how he drew strength from their examples.

I was highly disgusted with this book and didn't like most of the characters.<br /><br />The story opens in the late summer of 2002 with divorced mother Cindy Carver.  Cindy is a strident screamer who has an argument with her Prima Donna daughter Julia.  At 21, Julia is an aspiring actress and is at sword's points with Cindy, her 19-year-old sister Heather and Heather's live-in boyfriend, Duncan.  (How many parents would permit their daughter to install her live-in lover in their homes?)  Prima Donna manages to get everybody's juices flowing and even refuses to walk her wheaten terrier, Elvis.  She leaves in a huff for an audition with a well known director.<br /><br />When Julia fails to turn up for a fitting for her cousin's wedding, her equally strident aunt Leigh and her strident, domineering grandmother Norma all have the collective hissy fit.  Finally she is declared a missing person and Cindy, a foul-mouthed shrew will leave no stone unturned to find her.  Julia left her to move in with Tom in 1995 and only just returned to Cindy.  Cindy vows she will never lose her again.<br /><br />The list of possible suspects is longer than one would expect.  Julia's father Tom, an entertainment lawyer might have some insight.  He is also a cruel, boorish oaf and plays a sick, macabre trick.  An unstable neighbor and her husband are also possible suspects.  The director for whom Julia auditioned is yet another.  Cindy's silly, twittering movie pals are not to be crossed off the suspect list as well.<br /><br />Cindy's domineering mother and strident, bossy younger sister barge their way into her home during Julia's absence.  There are times when one wants to smack Leigh because she is such a whiner and cries about childhood slights.  She came across as intrusive and abrasive.<br /><br />The ending was a bust and a dismal disappointment.  The only character that was likable was Cindy's new boyfriend, a gentle accountant named Neil.  He should be called Saint Neil for putting up with her.  I didn't like the way egregious cruelty was covered up and unpunished.<br /><br />Cindy does some remarkably stupid things.  Like idiot Gail Walton of \\"Life Sentence\\" infamy before her, Cindy takes police investigative matters into her own hands and actually attacks somebody she suspects of abducting her daughter.  It is also interesting to note that Gail Walton lost a daughter named Cindy and in this book, the role is reversed - a Cindy is a parent of a missing child.  Whereas Cindy Walton was murdered, Cindy Carver is a raving ninny.  I also didn't like the way she nearly agreed to having an affair with Tom while Julia was missing.  I found the subplot involving the neighbors stupidly implausible and that weakened an already bad story.<br /><br />This is not a book that I would ever recommend.gregious cruelty was covered up and unpunished.

The other children provide their insights on their brother's behavior.<br />Autism is not clear cut nor is it black and white as the photographs in this book.  It is a neurosensory condition replete with behaviors that appear to have a sensory basis, e.g. aversion for loud noises and certain smells.<br />I felt the effort was good and the intentions were good, but I was disappointed in the book.  I felt it emphasized Russell's seeming isolation and did not explain that this was an individual account and not a general overview of autism.  Although the photographs would most likely make that point, I felt the book didn't quite get that across as the writing appeared to generalize autism when it is a spectrum condition that is as varied as the number of individuals who have it.	2003-10-15

Autism and its related neurobiological condition, Asperger's are spectrum conditions.  Common spectrum behaviors include a myriad of sensory issues such as strong aversions for loud noises; strong reactions to certain smells and tastes and distinctive speaking styles.  Many spectrum behaviors overlap and Asperger's, while considered at the higher end of the autism spectrum does indeed share common neuro-sensory ground with autism.<br />This book does a heroic job in explaining and addressing these issues to young children.  It is a good way of empowering children on and off the spectrum with knowledge that will in turn pave the way to greater acceptance.	2003-10-14

This is a sterling, high caliber first rate work.<br />Larry Kane, a veteran news reporter/broadcast journalist shares anecdotes of his year traveling with the Beatles.  He covers the concerts from 1964 and 1965 and gives in-depth analyses of each individual Beatle.  Kane's voice, the voice of a newsman rings pure and clear; he not only provides an objective reporting style, but he effectively includes his subjective feelings regarding the events and people he has covered.<br />This book contains material that is new even to inveterate Beatle fans; this book is a treasure trove of historical information.  Kane covers incidents as seemingly humorous as George Harrison aiming his drink at an intrusive reporter to events as serious as the safety and personal observations of each Beatle.<br />Kane's writing style is very inclusive; in covering the issues and events, he skillfully draws his readers in so that one feels a part of what is taking place in the narratives.  He is also quite adept at portraying the individuality of each person mentioned in the book.  I like the way  he has interviewed fans and included their input as well as updates on them.  I was also delighted that Kane included a list of Beatles' concerts, dates and places during 1964 - 1965.<br />I have had the pleasure of hearing Larry Kane speak several times; he has a real gift and a real flair as a raconteur and this book is proof positive of that.  A CD of interviews comes with the book and it is a bonus treat.<br />This is such a worthwhile book.  I can't recommend it highly enough.	2003-08-29

Asperger's Syndrome is a neurobiological condition that is on the same spectrum as autism and the accompanying behaviors are as varied as there are individuals who have it.<br />Daisy, the young protagonist is fully aware that she is on the a/A spectrum.  She is easily distracted by noises; a classmate's hair-chewing annoys her; certain sounds, tastes and smells upset her.  A grade-schooler, Daisy enters the story as a newly-mainstreamed pupil from a self contained program for persons with autism.  Her previous school carries the sad name School of Social And Developmentally Delayed, which automatically screams stigma.  Instead of being a helpful program, Daisy's previous school does not appear tailored to meet her academic and social needs.  At Ocean Vista, where she is mainstreamed, she has a very understanding teacher who explains her behaviors, e.g. hand flapping, noise sensitivity, verbal outbursts, uttering non sequiturs as well as esoteric words to her classmates.  Daisy often tended to use stilted utterances such as \\"powers of darkness\\" when describing bullying and her spontaneous display of affection when her principal sympathizes with some of her social difficulties.  Daisy also makes good use of the Resource Room when stimuli become too overwhelming.<br />Even with good back up, Daisy is targeted by a group of bullies, some of whom are her classmates.  In time, she learns to defend herself and makes friends with a boy named Cody who had also attended Daisy's former school.  A girl named Lauren takes Daisy under her wing and is amazingly accepting of Daisy's explanation of what it means to have Asperger's.  Indeed, a very funny exchange occurs between the girls when Lauren mispronounces Asperger's, thinking Daisy was making a rather rude joke.  That part was truly hilarious!<br />In time, as the girls bond with Cody, Daisy demonstrates her skill at animal training.  She had been working with the class rabbit Buster and had trained him to perform tricks.  It is through her work with Buster and with her two new friends that Daisy becomes empowered to act as a friend and step up to the plate for someone who really needs her help.<br />This is a wonderful book and a treat for all ages.  Please read this and share it with someone.  The acceptance of the principal, Daisy's teacher and Resource Room teacher point up to just how important inclusion really is.  I also like the resorces that the author lists at the end of the story.  Hats off to this book!orking with the class rabbit Buster and had trained him to perform tricks.

He also slept days and wailed nights. He accomplished developmental milestones within normal limits.<br /><br />Jimmy showed distinctive behavior from early toddlerhood. When he received a stuffed Big Bird toy for his first Christmas, that segues into an obsessive interest in collecting all Sesame Street Figures. Thomas the Tank soon followed, along with Woody, the cowboy marionette from \\"Toy Story.\\" Jimmy appeared to be upset by any changes; when Ringo Starr left \\"Shining Time Station\\" in 1992, it took Jimmy weeks to reorient himself to Ringo's replacement so he could continue watching his beloved Thomas the Tank Stories.<br /><br />Noises upset Jimmy; he could hear sounds from great distances. He did not play easily with other children and his nursery school teacher suggested that Jimmy be tested. It is during the battery of tests that it is discovered that Jimmy's special brand of speech, e.g. quoting whole passages from favorite videos and using excerpts of recorded dialogs as a method of communicating; his way of approaching people; his tenuous concept of ownership; his extreme adherence to routine; his general inability to shift focus or direction or position and difficulties in taking turns pointed to a possible diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome. In time this diagnosis was confirmed and Jimmy spent years in a special program for communication challenges. It was in this program that Jimmy made progress in learning how to demonstrate empathy, deciphering nonverbal cues, e.g. body language and facial expressions. Using examples from favorite TV programs helped Jimmy learn how and why people reacted the way they did. In one especially poignant exchange, Echo asks Jimmy if he remembers how \\"Terrence the Tractor\\" helped Thomas the Tank when he was in a jam and to apply that \\"help others\\" concept to his sister Caroline.<br /><br />Jimmy also learned to follow a set routine by breaking each task down into steps. That is not uncommon for people on the spectrum. He went through a period where he would \\"talk\\" to Echo through a puppet. Mother and son bonded during these bedtime chats and in time, Jimmy no longer relied on the puppet.<br /><br />Many people with spectrum issues display an extensive knowledge of certain esoteric matters. Jimmy was quite conversant on matters concerning artists and their works. Like his paternal grandfather, James Sr., Jimmy found the touch of certain fabrics unbearable. As a result of this, he would only wear certain types of materials. His grandfather was described as having these same clothing preferences and from the telling, it does indeed sound as if Jimmy's grandfather was on the spectrum as well.<br /><br />Jimmy would also have meltdowns in public places such as amusement parks because he found the stimuli intense and overwhelming; certain sounds also set him off. Family outings often came to a grinding halt because Jimmy found the bombardment of stimuli painful to the point of severe meltdowns.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me was the way Echo talked to Jimmy. I didn't like the infantile way she referred to herself as \\"Mommy\\" and spoke of herself in the third person. It really bothered me that she was still talking to Jimmy in this babyish fashion even after he reached the age of ten!<br /><br />I also didn't like Caroline's nickname of \\"Girly,\\" which sounded as if she was merely being reduced to her gender. I just loved it when Jimmy called her a butthead.<br /><br />Jim Jr. lamented Jimmy's seeming lack of affection toward him. In time, Echo pointed out that Jimmy did not like \\"loud and grabby\\" and overly demonstrative displays and found them overwhelming. I like the way she observed this and explained this to Jim Jr., who later told Jimmy he would not be \\"loud and grabby\\" and would, like Echo, allow Jimmy to approach him quietly in his own fashion. He could still indulge in the loud, demonstrative displays with Caroline, who loved them.<br /><br />Jimmy's behavior, while plainly indicative of the austistic spectrum sounded as if he operated closer to the autistic end of the spectrum. His social naivete and tendency to flap his hands indiscriminately point up to this. Jimmy had to be \\"taught\\" to flap his hands (a typical spectrum behavior closer to the autism end) in private due to social constraints. Another good example of autistic behavior was his extreme rigidity and adherence to routine. Still another was his litany of repetive questions over routine activities.<br /><br />The few parts I liked was when Echo explained to Jim, Jr. why their son fled hugs and that Santa was \\"just a fairy tale parents make up to bring Christmas joy\\" to their children. Jimmy's response of anger for \\"having been lied to\\" was certainly understandable.<br /><br />The \\"artichoke\\" comes into focus when one thinks of peeling back the thorny layers of an artichoke to get to the \\"heart\\" or edible part. Echo uses this analogy in the book. Peeling back layers of Jimmy's behaviors reveal a bright boy whose behavior certainly did justify a diagnosis of Asperger's helped empower them to understand spectrum behaviors and how to cope with them.<br /><br />All in all, a less-than-mediocre work. The inclusion of Tony Attwood's gems of wisdom was the one thing almost kept this from receiving a one-star review. His input was the best part of the book. I didn't care for this book.indulge in the loud, demonstrative displays with Caroline, who loved them.

Naturally Robin resents leaving the strict moralists; once in Tennessee she runs around with a questionable crowd; shoplifts and gets a stupid fat girl named Kathy to cover for her when she shoplifts.  She also gets involved sexually with an older man and goes joyriding.  Her antics finally land her in court and a judge remands her to a special school in an undisclosed location.  A Dodge car picks her up and deposits her minus her belongings to this undisclosed place.<br /><br />Teal, another birdbrain who is named after a bird (teal duck) is the classic, stereotypical \\"poor little rich girl.\\"  Unwanted by her disinterested parents and ignored by her adult brother, Teal steals and runs with a wild crowd.  She will do ANYTHING for affection and attention and when she steals a bracelet costing some $10,000.00 she is placed under house arrest.  She has an affair as do most GW/VC Andrews girls and this Mary-Sue character has an affair with a boy on the other side of the economic tracks.  He at least seems like a nice guy.  They run away together with his younger sister and brother in tow, but reality forces them to return and Teal is placed on a plane to an undisclosed location.<br /><br />Phoebe, also an avian namesake lives in Georgia with her salesman father.  Phoebe's mother, like Robin's (birds with singing mothers) cherishes a dream to sing in jazz bars.  She deserts her family, leaving Phoebe to her overwhelmed father.  Phoebe is barely literate and, like the other Mary-Sue characters in this book runs with a wild crowd.  When her father is killed in an accident (so many of GW/V.C. Andrews' characters are killed off in car accidents - at least ONE car accident claims at least ONE casualty in just about every V.C. Andrews series), her aunt and uncle take her in.  The aunt, a stern and moralistic sort grudgingly does her Christian duty and her uncle Buster, a dour soul lays down some more laws.  Their two children do what they can to be thorns in Phoebe's side.  Once in this affluent suburb of Atlanta, Phoebe is enrolled in a local school where she is placed in a self-contained class for children with learning disabilities.  It is there she learns she has dyslexia.<br /><br />Like the other Mary-Sues V.C. Andrews books are INFAMOUS for, Phoebe has an affair with a rich boy named Ashley.  They are caught in the school nurse's office.  Phoebe STILL doesn't get the message and she runs away, this time to find her mother who is in a hospital.  Once there, she is captured and brought back to her Uncle Buster who arranges to have her transported by ambulance under sedation to the mystery school.<br /><br />This ain't great, but it'll do for reading on a plane.  It makes you wonder when the very last GW/V.C. Andrews will be written.  The sex scenes are trite; the characters are almost always Mary-Sues and the same themes keep cropping up.

This book is truly a masterpiece and will delight all readers, from the inveterate George Harrison fans to people just becoming familiar with his works. Leng has a real flair for written expression and research. His extensive knowledge of Eastern music and how Harrison incorporated Eastern styles into his music enrich this work. Leng offers extensive coverage to people who influenced the late guitarist such as Klaus Voorman, an artist who had known George since the inception of the Beatles and who later drew the 1966 album cover for \\"Revolver,\\" pianist John Barhman and Ravi Shankar, the man who taught George to play the sitar.<br />Leng plainly respects the intelligence of his readers and his writing is clear, clean and crisp. There is no extraneous matter. Leng has a gift for piquing the interest and curiosity of readers. In reading this, one wants to know more about John Barham and the other people who influenced George Harrison. Leng's work is expansive; he excites interest and curiosity in an almost \\"ripple\\" effect form; each person named in his book \\"interlocks\\" in the way they influenced George Harrison. It is this approach that maintains readers' interest. Leng has researched his information well and his respect for George and the many people who influenced him and his art comes through plainly in this work. I like the way Leng accepts and acknowledges George, warts and all and the musical analysis he provides in this work.<br />The writing's on the wall - try some, buy some and please try and buy this book! This is a superior work!	2003-06-28

Asperger's Syndrome or AS is a neurological condition that is on the spectrum as autism.  It is NOT a mental illness.  Luke Jackson, the young author of this sterling work gives a clear and pure voice of what &quot;undefined behavioral/sensory differences&quot; mean in terms of coping on a routine daily basis.  Heightened sensory modes in addition to many of the behaviors that often accomopany AS such as rigid adherence to routines and/or ideas; social difficulties and literal interpretations of statements often stand out even more during puberty.  This brilliant young man has presented a good case for nutrition and autism/Aspeger's; (a/A) several of his siblings exhibit varying degrees of spectrum behaviors.<br />Dr. Tony Attwood, an author and Asperger's specialist has contributed to this book.  Dr. Attwood gives the Voice of Hope and the Stamp of Validity on Aspeger's.  He provides clear, logical descriptions of spectrum behavior as well as clear, logical definitions of Asperger's and its neurological relationship to autism.  Hats off to Dr. Attwood!<br />This is a book that will be cherished and used by parents, professionals, people with spectrum differences and people who are interested in spectrum differences.

She made all developmental milestones within normal limits as did her older sister, Dotsy. Speech was the only major milestone that Georgie did not make during her early years. She was nonverbal until she was 4.<br />Georgie's mother had many overwhelming issues - a divorce when the girls were quite small; Georgie's aversion for any sound, music included and Dotsy's being diagnosed with leukemia at age 4.<br />Annabelle naturally has Georgie tested and sent to early intervention programs. The only place where Georgie appeared to have thrived was at Bellevue Hospital because, as Georgie explained years later, \\"it was quiet there.\\" Dotsy's health plummets and she dies at the age of 8 in 1971. Georgie, then 6, was sent to a residential facility identified as \\"Childville.\\"<br />Childville sounds like a genuine Chamber of Horrors. Georgie complains about the noise and staff dismiss her complaints. She is overmedicated and complains about how the medicines make her feel. She becomes hostile and displays aggression because she cannot tolerate noise. A social worker who sounded cruel and incompetent from the telling, identified as \\"Judith\\" seems determined to block and undermine any and all progress on Georgie's part. When Georgie shows an unusual balancing ability and begs for a skateboard, Judith refuses, telling Georgie's mother that Georgie is \\"overcompensating a fear.\\" Fortunately Georgie gets her skateboard and is quite proficient on it.<br />Georgie is fortunate enough to have summers free of that institutional wasteland. Luckily for all, Annabelle marries Peter, a gentle, loving man. That union produces a brother and later a sister for Georgie. Peter has grown daughters from a previous marriage and it is in this loving, blended, extended family that Georgie blossoms.<br />Annabelle decides that Childville is just not the answer and withdraws Georgie in 1976. Peter had accepted a job in Switzerland, and naturally Georgie wanted to join her family. Childville staff threaten to keep Georgie by refusing to release her (how could this legally be done). Judith invokes just about every Freudian cliche possible to block Georgie's withdrawal from Childville. Fortunately, Peter and Annabelle withdraw Georgie and move to Switzerland. The medications are discontinued and for the next several years Georgie flourishes in Switzerland. She learns to ski, is mainstreamed and explains that her aversion for sound is due to having a heightened auditory sense. Luckily, she has been treated by several very humane doctors specially trained in Auditory Integration Therapy (AIT) and this treatment is continued during her years abroad. One can't help but cheer when Georgie dances in the rain, explaining that the rain \\"doesn't sound like a machine gun anymore.\\" Georgie said AIT literally saved her life.<br />After several years abroad, the family returns to the United States. Georgie's records \\"mysteriously vanish\\" because the cruise ship she was on met with a disaster and several cartons had to be discarded. The disaster turned out to be a blessing in disguise.<br />Free of previous baggage, Georgie attends a public school in Connecticut. She graduates as class valedictorian in 1984 and is currently happily married. She is now fluent in 6 languages including Arabic; is a gifted artist and very spiritual. Georgie is also an author. She has chronicled her life story in \\"Overcoming Autism,\\" in which she promises readers that upon reading her book they will have a very clear understanding of what it means to have autism.

Andy loves to play with his yellow frisbee.  This is an activity he prefers to using the playground equipment or playing with other children.  His sister Rosie keeps a watchful eye on Andy, especially when she sees another child eyeing him curiously.<br />Instead of ridiculing Andy who has autism, the other child goes over to meet him.  Disarmed, Rosie begins chatting with the girl, explaining Andy's behavior and about autism in general.  Andy's frisbee spinning is extended to spinning plates and other objects; his strong reactions to sensory stimuli e.g. loud noises are addressed.  Rosie acts as an advocate for Andy; she includes him in what she is doing.<br />This is truly a lovely story that makes no promises and does not gloss over the sensory and social and developmental challenges that people on the autism spectrum routinely contend with.  I like the way Rosie accepts Andy unconditionally and I like the way the author includes resource information about autism.	2003-06-06

It is written in a clear and direct fashion.  For many people with Asperger's, having instructions and/or information broken down into manageable portions is a very effective approach.<br />I like the way this book explains behaviors that are common among many people with Asperger's.  Since this is a neurological spectrum condition that is on the autism spectrum, many of the challenges people with Asperger's face are sensory ones.  People with Asperger's often have heightened sensory modes and have extreme reactions to stimuli, e.g. strong adverse responses to loud noises.  Meltdowns are gently explained; sometimes they are the result of sensory overload.  Sensory overload makes me think of the 1967 George Harrison classic \\"It's All Too Much\\" which explains sensory overload so well, \\"it's all too much for me to see...it's all too much for me to take.\\"  I also like the way coping mechanisms are described in this book.<br />Another challenge many people on the spectrum face is difficulty in the subtle nuances of communciation, e.g. facial expressions and use of certain idiomatic expressions.  Many people on the spectrum see issues as \\"black or white\\" with no gradations in between.  Sadly, comments perceived as \\"blunt, rude or hostile\\" by others are often faux pas on the part of the person with Asperger's and if the objection to the comments in question are explained, persons on the spectrum become cognitively aware of what constitutes social savvy.  The 1966 George Harrison classic \\"I Want to Tell You\\" is a good description of the communication challenges many people on the spectrum face:  \\"but if I seem to act unkind, it's only me, it's not my mind.  That is confusing things.\\"  So often misinterpretations are the result of verbal meanings being misconstrued.<br />Since Asperger's IS a spectrum condition, it varies from individual to individual.  It can range from severe and closer to the Autism end of the spectrum to mild and barely discernible to most people.to mild and barely discernible to most people.	2003-06-06

It had high and low points.  The high points were the voice of acceptance that was being given to explaining Asperger's, which is a neurological condition on the autism spectrum to children.  It is a good starter book for sharing with children on the spectrum who continue coping with \\"undefined differences.\\"<br />One thing that bothered me was that the writing suggested a \\"uniform, one size fits all\\" approach and description of Asperger's.  This can be misleading to readers.  Still, it was a good faith effort and one that can be used to empower children on the spectrum and explain their \\"differences\\" in a clear cut, humane and frank way.	2003-06-06

Many people with Asperger's, which is a neurobiological condition that is on the same spectrum as autism often miss social cues.  Facial expressions, expected responses and nonverbal nuances are often not readily obvious to people with Asperger's.  Many people with Asperger's Syndrome find having tasks broken down into a sequence of steps a helpful approach in processing information.<br />Carol Gray's book does accomplish this.  This work also covers \\"empathy,\\" a concept that many people with Asperger's find challenging.  Empathy, or the ability to mentally and emotionally put oneself in the place of another person is something that many people with Asperger's have to be taught cognitively.  This is not to suggest that people on the autism spectrum do not care about people; such is not the case at all.  Empathy or being able to \\"see\\" from the vantage point of another is yet another skill that is broken down into manageable steps in this book.<br />Adults on the spectrum might find this a helpful tool.  It provides a clear picture of how people navigate through social territory and often find mountains and road blocks instead of a clear path.	2003-06-06

He naturally feels protective of Matthew and in so doing, forms a bond with his brother that is truly heartwarming indeed.<br />This is an excellent book for families and educators.  In fact, this book is really for everbody and is a good bonding as well as teaching tool.  Readers of all ages will be able to relate to David's feelings and see how he and his brother flourish.	2003-06-06

Books	5	35	44	N	N	An Excellent "TEACCHing" Tool	How I wish I had had this book as a child.  This is a good teaching tool for helping children with Asperger's understand their \\"undefined differences,\\" make peace with them and explain them to other people.  I like the way the book emphasizes the  point that \\"different\\" does not necessarily mean stigmatized.<br />This work does a great service in making efforts to remove the stigma often associated with Asperger's.  Although Asperger's is a neurological \\"difference\\" that IS on the Autism spectrum, it is not \\"autism,\\" per se.  Many argue the point that it is a form of autism, or a \\"milder form,\\" but that question remains open.  What IS known about Asperger's is that it is INDEED a spectrum condition and that it DOES share some autistic properties.  Sadly, \\"autism\\" is such a highly charged term that it often eclipses the different challenges people with Asperger's contend with.  This book does an admirable job of addressing this issue.<br />I highly recommend this one for all people whether or not they are on the spectrum.  It has good information and paves the way to acceptance.	2003-06-06

A gifted artist, Kevin provides the rich illustrations in this book and lends his \\"voice\\" to describe the world he confronts on a routine daily basis.<br />Autism and its related condition, Asperger's Syndrome is a series of sensory related issues.  Sounds are amplified; strong aversions for vaccuum cleaners are not uncommon.  One can feel Kevin's pain every time he has to endure the vaccuum cleaner and other painful sounds in his environment.  Sensory modes are often heightened, people with spectrum conditions (autism/Asperger's) find coping mechanisms in facing sensory onslaught.  This book provides good descriptions of these issues.<br />This is an excellent work that will attract all ages.  It is something for all educators, parents and other interested parties to use and learn from.  It is an invaluable work in seeing the rationale for the behavior of many people on the autism spectrum.  Routine often provides security and changes or disruptions can often make one feel threatened.  This book provides examples of this.<br />Richard and Kevin will remain permanently in the hearts of all who read this book.  Please read this.	2003-06-06

Shunned by most children because of his propensity for non sequitors and his heightened sensory modes (e.g. strong aversion for loud noises and certain smells and tastes), Ben launches on what becomes a wonderous adventure.  Other boys join in Ben and Andy's digging quest and when they unearth a mysterious blue bottle, each imagines the bottle is inhabited by a genie.  Each boy makes a wish individual to his needs and let's just say the results will make you smile.<br />Ben is a delightful character and his description of the ongoing challenges he has with Asperger's Syndrome is a welcome voice for many.  Asperger's Syndrome (AS) is a neurological condition that is on the same spectrum as autism.  Ben's undefined differences that impede social development were due to AS; Ben gives excellent descriptions of AS and the challenges and yet, the bonuses it has to offer.<br />This is a must read for everyone.

Kenneth Hall, the young man who wrote it provides a candid inside view of Asperger's Syndrome or AS.  AS is a neurological condition that is on the Autism spectrum.<br />A brilliant young man, Kenneth Hall discusses his early school experiences; his current home schooling curriculum and the people he works with; his sensitivity to loud noises and tastes; his heightened sensory modes and his loving family.  I love his sense of humor.  He describes his behavior program where he says he has learned to break tasks down into a sequence of steps in order to follow through and not lose his place.  I love the way he describes the jokes he pulls and the games he enjoys.<br />This gifted young man is truly a gift.  His deep spirituality and his acceptance of himself all speak to hope, empowerment and a positive face on Asperger's.  A spectrum condtion and NOT a mental illness, Asperger's Syndrome is often considered \\"undefined differences\\" and many persons with AS are not diagnosed.  This book will provide good clear explanations and descriptions of it.  How wonderful it would have been had this book existed a generation ago.

At 18 months, he taught himself to read from watching Sesame Street. At 19 months, Ben's family relocated from New Jersey to southern California. Ben remembers that trip and his first bedroom when he lived in the northeastern United States.<br /><br />A distinctive personality, Ben showed a high level of comprehension for most abstract concepts. He could navigate just about any place he was and he had a fondness for maps. He was inordinately attached to his \\"Child's History of the World\\" and \\"Child's Geography\\" books and avidly read them each night. Nonathletic, Ben compensated by memorizing Dodger ball games he heard on the radio. A brilliant mimic with an extraordinary memory, Ben could repeat long passages from TV programs, conversations and written material. In childlike role play with peers, he always insisted on being a television or radio and he preferred reading to playing with other children. He also spoke in a formal style, not unlike an adult (\\"hello, my name is Benjamin and I am very pleased to meet you.\\") He had a high sensitivity to sound; when he was as young as one year old, he would implore his parents not to fight because \\"it's too loud and I don't like loud.\\" I like the way Ben's father Steven was honest with him about the marital discord and told him that yes, they were indeed fighting. I also like the way he reassured Ben after the decision to get divorced was made.<br /><br />Ben's problems were not confined to the obvious challenges of having Asperger's. Ben's mother Barbara LaSalle admitted being unable to accept Ben for years and lamented Ben's inability to make friends from the time he was a pre-schooler.  When forced into enduring a playdate at his home, I thought the playdate was really for the parents and not the children.  That's why I just loved it when Ben, seeing an out, left the other boy alone so he could race off to his room and read.<br /><br />The other thing that puzzled me was when Ben's mother said that \\"baking cookies is something you do when your child has a playdate.\\"  That is not a social rule.  Why not serve fruit to the kids instead?  Making cookies was a voluntary decision, not a compulsory one.  My feeling was why not just have store bought cookies ready to serve instead of leaving those two young children alone to bake?  As I read that passage, I couldn't help wondering why the boys were left unsupervised.  In retrospect, it seems like one approach would have been to be involved in what the boys were doing; to suggest alternate activies, e.g. \\"I'll set the timer and for 10 minutes will play outside doing something Greg wants.  In 10 minutes Greg can pick a story and Ben can read to all of us,\\" which encourages fairness, sharing and taking turns.<br /><br />Ben would try to appease his mother by telling her what he thought would make her happy, e.g. a movie date with a peer or being a member of a football team when his school had no such team. Divorced from Ben's father when Ben was 5, the two coped as best they could until she married John, a gentle loving man in 1975. Ben's brother David was born that August.<br /><br />One thing that really bothered me was the \\"motor therapy\\" his preschool teacher recommended. Since Ben's eyes worked independently and he disliked physical activity and contact sports, he was immediately stared on motor therapy at age 3 together with eye exercise therapy with another doctor. This method seemed rather questionable to me and I was extremely disgusted with \\"Ms. Reed,\\" the motor therapist. I didn't like the way she forced her player piano on her young clients. Ben and Barbara had no sooner arrived for Ben's first session when Miss Reed eagerly ushered them into her living room to show it offto Ben. Ben made it plain from the first session that he destested it, found it terrifying and implored her not to make him sit in the living room with it. I didn't like the way Ms. Reed talked to Ben or Barbara; I also didn't like the way she kept insisting that counting backward (what was that supposed to accomplish), jumping on a trampoline or spinning in a revolving basket would be fun when Ben made it plain otherwise. He even said he found her house frightening. The topper for me was when she made Ben sit in her living room with that oversized music box. Ben screamed in abject fear and a neighbor wisely called 911. I cheered the neighbor! After Ms. Reed forced him to endure it, I wanted to dispose of it myself. I really thought that was sadistic and I thought it served her right that the neighbor called 911. She plainly couldn't wait to get Ben alone so she could force that noisemaker on him, ostensibly to help him overcome his fear of it. That oversized music box reflected HER needs and had nothing to do with Ben or any projected goals for his physical progress. I didn't like the way she downplayed Ben's fear when telling Barbara about it and the way she said, \\"either he gets it now or never...be afraid the rest of his life...\\" when she caused that problem in the first place. I also could not understand why Ben was forced to endure her for years after that disastrous experience. That bothered me.<br /><br />Ben remained true to form. He had trouble organizing his work in school; he had trouble making friends and sports were just not his area of interest. John helped Ben over the worst of his distaste for physical activity by teaching him to climb the jungle gym and ride a bicycle. Although these were never favorite activities of Ben's, he at least had the satisfaction of mastery. John accomplished what the \\"experts\\" did not.<br /><br />Ben suffered another set back during the 1980-81 school year. That year Ben was sent with his father who enrolled him in an Arizona boarding school. Ben, suffering from a then undiagnosed Crohn's disease suffered from fecal incontinence. He was abused by other boys and lost 40 pounds his first month. Husky from a young age with a rigid adherence to certain foods, Ben was literally shrinking away that year. Barbara reclaimed custody of Ben and withdrew him from the school at the close of the year.<br /><br />Ben's high school years were a litany of challenges. He changed schools more than once and suffered severe social set backs. By 1987, Ben, then 18 expressed feelings of violent anger and was hospitalized. He became quite husky during this period and the asthma he had since age 3 had worsened. He served time in hospitals over the next few years.<br /><br />In April of 1989 came the crowning blow. On April 29, 1989 Ben threatened another resident at the half way house he was living in because he was upset by the noise the latter was making. He dropped his weapon and allowed to be turned in. Over the course of that week, Ben was forced to endure degrading treatment in the local jail. Only one trusty, a man named Rocky stepped up to the plate for him. (note: April 29, 1989 was a Saturday. Each day in the first week of May, 1989 which was chronicled in the book was set one day ahead and this makes one wonder if this was a psychological device to speed up a horrendous week). It was Rocky's tough love that helped Ben survive the legal difficulty he was in.<br /><br />Thanks to Rocky, the \\"bald angel with the tattooes\\" and Doris, a caring worker in a hospital who helped Ben learn to \\"play the game\\" so he could be released and the very astute Dr. Mark DeAntonio, Ben's story is now something everyone can take proud delight in. By the early 1990s, one of Dr. LaSalle's friends directed her to Dr. DeAntonio. A sensitive, direct and no-nonsense man from the telling, Dr. DeAntonio reviewed Ben's records and provided mother and son with the answer -- autism. I like the way Dr. LaSalle was finally ableto accept Ben and realize that Dr. DeAntonio was not there to reassure her, but to provide some clear answers for Ben's social difficulties. Ben's undefined differences were on the autism spectrum and Dr. DeAntonio does a wonderful job of explaining what Asperger's really means and how it has a place on the autism spectrum.<br /><br />Upon reading this sterling work, I think of Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz saying in effect that everything you are seeking is really right at home. Finding Ben -- he was there all along.<br /><br />This book will empower persons on the spectrum and others who work and/or live with people on the spectrum and will serve as a voice of hope. Ben and Dr. LaSalle are now advocates for people with Asperger's. I can't recommend this book highly enough.<br /><br />The world is finally catching up to Ben, but I think he's ahead.iagnosed Crohn's disease suffered from fecal incontinence.

Asperger's Syndrome (AS)is on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum and has long been regarded as the \\"high functioning end of the autism spectrum.\\"  Because this IS a spectrum, the behaviors and experiences and manifestations are as varied as there are individuals on the spectrum.  However, there are certain diagnostic criteria that have to be met in order to determine if someone has Asperger's Syndrome or a place on the a/A spectrum.<br />Tony Attwood validates the behavior of people on the spectrum; he writes in a plain, straight forward style that reaches ALL readers from professionals to persons just learning about Asperger's.  I like the way he encourages people with Aspeger's embrace and accept this aspect of their lives.  Tony Attwood makes it plain that a diagnosis of Asperger's is NOT a death knell or a mental health condemnation; on the contrary, he describes a place on the a/A spectrum as a baseline for behaviors that had previously caused \\"undefined differences.\\"  Asperger's is not a mental illness and this point is underscored throughout the book.  Tony Attwood's voice is one of gentleness and acceptance; he describes behavior and sensory issues including synesthesia (linked sensory modes) in a way that invites and opens the door to discourse.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.  Tony Attwood not only validates Asperger's, he explains it in a thoroughly logical and accepting way.  This book deserves a place of honor among educators, medical/psychological/psychiatric professionals, parents whose children are on the spectrum and people who are on the spectrum.  In fact, this is a book for everybody.  THANK YOU, TONY ATTWOOD!	2003-05-09

The protagonist, Terry, rents her cottage to a young woman named Alison Simms. Terry has been unlucky in love, unlucky in childhood and unlucky with tenants. Alison offers fun and friendship and introduces Terry to a rather questionable crowd.<br />Terry is not a likable character. A bitter nurse, she pins her hopes on having a romantic relationship with the son of one of her geriatric patients on the terminal ward. This starts off promising, but ends up a bust.<br />Parts of the story made no sense.  Alison and her friends are a bizarre, eclectic bunch.  A Thanksgiving celebration with them and Terry takes on a surreal tone; when they meet Terry at her job for New Year's, that is just too unrealistic.  The sequence of events that take place near the ocean are stupid and implausible.  In fact, all of the holiday scenes and beach scenes are ludicrous to the point of surreal.<br />Masks come off and villains change roles and places. The questions are is Alison who and what she claims to be, a newcomer to Florida in need of a place to stay and friends? Is Terry what she claims to be, a bitter, lonely nurse? And what of Alison's friends and Terry's former borders?<br />There are no winners here. My favoite part was when Terry sang \\"She Loves You\\" along with the Beatles when she heard the song on the radio.  If that's the best this work has to offer...The ending is a bust and is a major disappointment. Skip this one.

I was extremely disappointed and highly displeased not only with the overall content, but with the author's treatment of other artists mentioned in the book. I didn't like the way other artists such as Eric Clapton, Elton John, Billy Preston, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney and others appear to be casually dismissed at best and lampooned at worst. Although the book does come with the disclaimer \\"a strictly personal view,\\" it still raises the question of whether or not there were axes to grinde in the way it was written.<br />The book follows a somewhat choppy sequence; it starts with George's post-Beatles career, tracks his life and untimely death in November, 2001. I also disliked the way the author appeared to dismiss Eastern philosophy, which does a great disservice to George's core beliefs and ideologies.<br />The song reviews appear to be sadly shallow and lacking; the chief complaint here is that the songs do not appear to have been researched. The digs at other artists are hearsay; the sycophantic tone used where George Harrison is concerned stands in almost ludicrous contrast to this.<br />This book is a complete waste of time and a major disappointment. Read \\"Harrison\\" by Jason Fine instead.	2002-12-30

Books	5	25	25	N	N	THE ROOT OF BEAUTY	The narrator of this tale is a bright, beautiful little girl who is proud of her naturally thick curly Black hair. She, like most folks find combout sessions quite painful, but her very wise mother tells her why she is lucky to have such beautiful, thick, naturally curly hair.<br />Keyana, the child narrator describes the care her hair requires; her mother rubs coconut oil into her scalp to help the comb glide through it. Her mother applies rich poetic descriptions to Keyana's hair; she tells Keyana every time she corn rows it, it is like planting a beautiful garden; when she combs it out into a big, beautiful Afro, it is a globe as round as the world that contains everybody; she tells Keyana she can spin it like silk the way their ancestors spun silk on a loom. Each description is accompanied by a lovely picture showing the mother's vision; for example, when she applies the silk comparison, Keyana is drawn with her beautiful hair being spun on a loom.<br />Keyana herself celebrates her natural beauty, hair and all and takes pride in the myriad of hairstyles her thick, curly hair will allow her to try. I like the way she said that the hair styling sessions were a time of mother-daughter bonding and the illustrations are first rate.<br />This is a book all parents and educators will want to use to promote self pride among all children, particularly children who are black. This book celebrates the beauty of being human.  It is for everybody.  I love this book!	2002-10-18

It is sure to delight all readers from inveterate Beatles' fans to people becoming familiar with the indelible stamp the Beatles left upon the world at large.<br /><br />The illustrations add to this masterpiece.  The interviews by people who knew George Harrison personally are what makes this book so effective in reaching its intended audience.  Each individual's voice rings clear and pure; one gets a sense of each person and how they were touched and influenced by George Harrison.<br /><br />To the editors' credit, this book does not languish during the Beatle years; instead, it picks up speed immediately and maintains an even keel throughout the late artist's life.  I like the way the songs are discussed and the influences that guided and created them.<br /><br />This book is a sterling work.  I highly and heartily recommend it.	2002-10-18

As a Beatles' expert, there was little if any new material in this work for me, but I did enjoy it from a \\"teaching\\" perspective.<br />This is not meant to be a scholarly or comprehensive work about the Beatles nor is it a \\"Dick & Jane\\" format of merely simplifying their works to the basic \\"Hear/See the Beatles Play. ....\\" To describe it from either extreme is to do it a grave injustice; to view it is a harmless teaching tool that also has humorous passages is indeed, I believe the more accurate approach.<br />I enjoyed it. This book is a good resource tool for the person who is \\"newly\\" coming into the Beatles.	2002-10-18

Long dubbed the Quiet Beatle and other similar cliches, George Harrison does indeed offer his voice and reflections in this work.  Always a private man, George's wordings here can be described as almost cryptic.<br />This work provides readers with a &quot;glimpse&quot; of George growing up; the former Beatle describes his working class roots in Liverpool, his musical muse and later, his work as a gifted composer, guitarist and lyricist.  Indeed, George Harrison has expanded musical horizons; in 1965 he became enamored of the sitar and included it on several songs on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and later collections.<br />His lifelong quest for spiritual knowledge and core belief system are explored; indeed, it is in his own words he explains that he does not follow an &quot;organized&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; religion, but rather bases his spiritual feelings around his internal beliefs.<br />I like the input the artist's wife Olivia offered; her words are a welcome and added treat to this work.  Indeed, it is Olivia's contribution that make the reissue of this work even better and more effective in touching readers.	2002-10-16

Venus rarely speaks and goes into attack mode when jostled by other children on the playground. Venus remains a silent observer in the class she shares with 9-year-old Billy, a gifted child with a minor case of dyslexia and a propensity for impulsive behavior; 8-year-old Jesse, a boy who has Tourette's Syndrome; 6-year-old twins Shane and Zane who have the congenital condition of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and part-time resource pupils 8-year-old Gwennie, a bright girl whose behavior and verbalizations are described as autistic and 8-year-old Alice, also given to frequent non sequitors interspersed with very poignant comments.<br /><br />This group finally unites after a series of setbacks. Early in the year, fighting broke out contantly among the boys; Venus, too displayed a fair share of aggression whenever she attacked someone who bumped into her. The tension among the pupils was paralleled in Torey Hayden's differing educational approaches with her aide, Julie.<br /><br />Matters reach a critical head when Venus is placed on homebound instruction for 2 months after she severely injures another child. During her absence, the boys team up by forming the poignantly ironic named group, \\"the Chipmunks\\" as a way of helping one another and gaining positive reinforcement. When Venus returns, she literally has to start from scratch. A chance encounter with a 1980s comic figure, She-Ra, sparks her curiosity; from there, Venus and teacher Torey Hayden knock down yet another wall. Venus expresses her wishes for a better life and for power and a \\"magic sword\\" like She-Ra has; she begins to inch her way into the group.<br /><br />More walls are knocked down; Julie is transferred to another school and an aide named Rosa takes her place. Rosa and Venus bond instantly; the love between them is truly heartwarming. The boys make remarkable strides as well. In one especially touching exchange, Billy tells Jesse how he has overcome his bigotry towards other races because he personally knows Jesse, who is a member of a different race than Billy. Major issues are explored; each child has good insights and heartwarming observations. During such round table discussions, even more walls come tumbling down.<br /><br />As Venus develops more confidence in herself and relies less on She-Ra and her magic sword, she develops friendships in the class. Alice literally takes Venus under her wing and insists on \\"being best friends\\" with her. A good placement in a loving, nuturing home after having endured years of abuse and neglect also accelerates the progress Venus makes. I like the way the book provides updates on the progress of each pupil.<br /><br />John Mellencamp's 1983 smash \\"Crumbling Down\\" could be the soundtrack of this book along with David Bowie's famous cover of Hunky Dory's 1971 hit \\"Changes.\\"<br /><br />I can't recommend this one highly enough.lly touching exchange, Billy tells Jesse how he has overcome his bigotry towards other races because he personally knows Jesse, who is a member of a different race than Billy.

The children assigned to her resource room featured in this book are a 12-year-old girl who is pregnant; an 11-year-old boy who witnessed the murder of his father; a 7-year-old girl whose father battered her during her infancy causing severe brain damage and a 7-year-old boy whose behavior is described as autistic.<br /><br />In the interest of fairness, there is really no way for readers to \\"know\\" or declare how \\"pretty\\" any of the pupils are; this is not the place to proclaim \\"favorite pupils.\\"  Responding to the individual gifts each pupil had to offer is the underlying theme of this book.  \\"Somebody Else's Kids\\" chronicles the lives of real people that most readers don't even know.  In the interest of fairness, without personally knowing the teacher assigned to Lori, the 7-year-old, it is very easy to make a strong case against her based on her response to this child's academic needs.  Early in the book, Lori's teacher, identified as \\"Edna Thorsen,\\" is described as being an excellent teacher with a long standing in conventional teaching methods.  Although her treatment and response to Lori is indeed shocking, again, in the interest of fairness, it is simply the way the events are portrayed in this book.  This is not to overlook her long established career.<br /><br />Tomaso, the boy who witnessed his father's death and Lori form a strong bond in that class that is indeed heartwarming.  They appear to be mutually good influences and accounts of the progress they make are truly inspiring.  Claudia, the 12-year-old girl and Boo, the youngest child make incredible strides as well.  Indeed this group is proof positive of human resilience and the sterling examples of kindness that were extended to them.  Their story is one about fairness.	2002-08-24

Linda, most known for her photographs of famous rock stars of the 1960s and, later for marrying former Beatle Paul McCartney fully emerges as a person in her own right in this book.<br />Born to an affluent family having roots in the Manhattan suburb of Scarsdale, New York, Linda's trek down her long and winding road is carefully followed.  Her stellar success photographing famous rock stars is well chronicled as is her later commitments to causes such as environmental isses as well as children's rights.<br />Linda is indeed a success story.  She has pioneered and championed causes with singular determination; her four children are her best successes of all.  In the 1990s, Linda launched frozen vegetarian dinners and had even released a vegetarian cookbook.<br />This book is such a treat.

They are no longer able to attend the private school where they had established peer relationships; at the public school they now attend they often feel slighted.<br />Caroline's fortune appears to change at a chance encounter in a park.  A casual conversation with a seemingly interested person  leads her literally to love.  She is soon introduced to Tony Fleming, a sophisticated gentleman who lives in Central Park West in a building many describe as being haunted.  Shortly after their wedding, the family of four settles into the &quot;haunted house&quot; and frightening events become the norm.  Only Ryan appears to be aware of the senior population and how they appear to be rejuvenating; even a portrait on the ceiling appears to reflect the ages of the established occupants.<br />The quest for youth appears to be the priority of the building's residents.  Children disappear and the question is who and what is responsible.  Is Tony what he seems?  And does he really know Caroline and her children before he married her?<br />This chilling story will certainly keep readers engrossed until that last page is read.	2002-08-08

One is her mother who is Japanese and the other is her paternal grandmother who is black.  She draws beautiful contrasts and cultural bonds between the two women; for example she describes the Japanese dinners her mother makes and the soul southern cooking she enjoys when she eats with her grandmother.  Her mother is delicate and petite; her grandmother is husky and stout.  Her mother is known for her quiet anger whereas her grandmother has a booming voice that she also uses for singing in church.<br /><br />Both women encourage the young Toyomi to explore her rich ancestry; her mother has kimonos tied with obi sashes for her to play dress up in and her grandmother has a wide collection of hats she wears to church.<br /><br />Although the two women look nothing alike and have contrasting expressions, they both love Toyomi and her father.  [[ASIN:1847800343 My Two Grannies]] is a good companion book to this one.

The exotic breed is known for not shedding, cleaning themselves like cats, laughing and yodeling.  Small and lithe, the clean-limbed dogs run like antelopes and glide when they walk.  Their foreheads are deeply wrinkled and they have doubly curled tails which ride on their backs.  They are indeed unusual.<br />The basenji has a long reaching history.  Ancient Egyptians used basenji shaped footstools and featured the exotic hounds in paintings.  Anubis, the God of the Underworld was depicted with a basenji head.  The dogs were the cherished pets of the noble gentry.<br />In the 1930s, basenjis were imported to Europe, Canada and the United States.  They have quite a following and many basenji organizations and publications have sprung up as a nod to this delightful breed of dog.	2002-06-25

No two ways about it.<br /><br />The protagonist is a fatuous girl named Sydney. She is a foolish girl who convinces herself and tries to convince other people that her natural father is a famous rock star, a member of the Australian group, the Boomerangs.<br /><br />The Boomerangs are a thinly disguised ersatz version of the Beatles. Since the story is set in 1988 and John Lennon was at that time the only Beatle who was no longer living, naturally the Boomerangs had to have a deceased member. The Beatles had Ringo with the trademark nickname, so the fictitious Boomerangs had the fictitious \\"Pudge\\" as Ringo's imaginary counterpart. Jamie, George's imaginary counterpart is silly Sydney's Boomerang of choice and she does some really stupid things. She writes a letter to the local paper saying she is Jamie's daughter; when she comes across an article about the death of Jamie's mother, she cries over the death of her grandmother.<br /><br />Sydney's mother is another ludicrous charcter. The only thing she has told silly Sydney about her father is that he was Australian; Sydney invents the rest. They live in an apartment with a nosy landlord who has the audacity to question the mother's social life. Since when does an adult have a curfew or have to report to a landlord?!<br /><br />The ending is as stupid as Sydney. I didn't like Sydney at all and I really didn't care for this stupid story.

She suffers from a complex regarding her appearance all of her life and after a traumatic encounter with some boys during her kindergarten year (1976-77) and an attempted rape by her employer some 15 years later prompts her to act.<br />Like Sleeping Beauty, Charlotte revels in her new image in the mirror.  Like Cinderella, she meets a prince from California who literally sweeps her off her feet.  Like the Ugly Duckling, she feels as if she has developed into a beautiful duck (cygnets are young swans).

She literally has to make a decision that not only will affect her career, but her life.<br />I did find the story a tad implausible.  I found her whirlwind success as an actress rather hard to believe and the story did follow a nice little formulaic pattern.  It was also easy to figure out the true identity of some of the characters and the \\"surprise\\" ending was really not a surprise to me.<br />Even though it was a nice little forumlaic package, it was an entertaining read.

I did not feel it ranked among the better Beatle biographies. The selection of photographs were good and I liked the few tidbits about Olivia Arias, the late artist's widow.<br />Since this book came out just a scant few months after the late Beatle's demise, one cannot help but wonder if the timing of its publication is yet another way to cash in on the Beatles' fame. Since George Harrison is no longer living in the material world, his input remains unknown. This work is certainly not one I would give a ringing endorsement, but it did hold my interest because of the subject.<br />At best this is a good starter book for people who want a \\"quick fix\\" in learning the basics of George Harrison's life.

I was sadly disappointed.<br />This tired story is the classic good twin/evil twin.  Meg, the good twin lives in Crawford Corners, Connecticut (how's THAT for alliteration)? and only just discovers she is one half of a set of twins.  Candra, the twin, lived in Jamaica until her adoptive grandmother's employers moved to Connecticut.<br />Naturally there are some mix ups and embarrassing encounters involving Meg and Candra.  Meg's foolish mother, punitive stepfather and out of control half sister add to her list of woes; Candra's appearance and determination to take over Meg's life does not improve things.<br />I thought the character of Rosamund, the adoptive grandmother was implausible as was the character of Dahlia Parker, the psychic.  I was really disappointed in the story and thought it was just a flat caricature and a heavy reliance upon stereotypes.<br />In a way, it's kind of too bad \\"Possession,\\" the sequel was never published.

She just happens to have Mayor Stratford's 7-year-old son Brian as her pupil and she just happens to be especially fond of Brian.<br />Mayor Stratford is not without his share of challenges.  A compulsive gambler with a cruel, highly powerful father and a loving younger brother named Connor who bails him out of every jam he has ever been in, the mayor is indeed an appealing and believable character.  Shady business dealings and questionable characters all are a part of this story; the mayor's own weaknesses or &quot;hubris&quot; come to the forefront nicely.<br />Julia Talbot is really the star of this story.  When Brian is kidnapped and the mayor is blackmailed, Connor Stratford begins dating her ostensibly to keep her from prying into the Stratfords' lives.  Her interest in Brian does put her in a political high risk category.<br />Villians change faces and players assume different positions in this highly compelling story.  The characters are all richly drawn and are quite credible, even the ending which makes for a &quot;sweet&quot; story indeed.	2002-04-05

A bright, athletic girl, Liba left behind an unpromising life in Czechoslavakia and an abusive mother and her younger sister in 1969.  Liba, then 20, was chafing under years of oppression and maternal abuse and the rigid border patrols in post-WWII Czechoslavakia.  She seizes the first chance to leave the country, seeking asylum in Norway with a touring group.  She marries the man she travels with so as to declare citizenship in her new country.<br />Shortly after arriving in Canada, the marriage falls apart.  As Liba beomes fluent and proficient in English and her trade, drafting, her first husband becomes more possessive and controlling.  Liba leaves him by moving in with friends.  It is there that she meets her second husband, Alois Delojs, Jr., another immigrant from her home country.  In time, the pair marry.  Their first child, Paul, was born 4/10/74 and daughter Gabriela was born 7/24/76.  Alois (&quot;Al&quot;) becomes abusive to Liba, beating and berating her and trying to impose a house arrest upon her.<br />Liba summons up her nerve to stand up to Al; it is his singular abuse of Paul that strengthens her resolve.  Whereas Al was cruel to Paul, he adored Gabriela, (&quot;Gabi&quot;), although he neglected her as an infant, leaving her untended and unfed for hours while Liba worked, moving up the ranks in drafting.<br />Paul and Gabi were extremely bright, verbal, loving and protective of Liba.  The brother and sister bonded immediately; it is truly heartwarming to read of how the pair loved each other and played easily and naturally together.  They both appeared to have wisdom and maturity far beyond their young years.  Both read early and were bilingual in Czech and English.<br />Matters reach a critical head when Liba insists Al leave and takes legal action.  Al retaliates by killing the children on July 27, 1986.<br />This tragic story underscores how ill equipped the legal system was in affording protection to families in need.

Let was for the birds.<br />Set in 1994, this tale of teenage wasteland and angst opens with Let describing the cataclysmic disasters that landed her in a hospital with serious injuries.  Let and her older brother, Logan, a time bomb waiting to explode have been given a large dose of freedom.  Both were given cars on their 16th birthdays; Logan ended up trading his late model Pontiac Firebird for a heap of a 1971 Plymouth Duster the junkman wouldn't want.  Let is given a beautiful black 1995 Honda Accord.  Sadly, shortly after receiving this wonderful gift, Let damages it.<br />Let runs with a fast crowd.  Her quasi-boyfriend Henry is bad news; he is older than Let and pushes her into sex and drugs.  Logan eggs this on; he has his own bizarre tattoed girlfriend (nicknamed \\"Tat\\" by Let) and issues to contend with.<br />The marital discord between the Hitchcocks reach a head in late 1994.  The father walks out (and one honestly couldn't blame him) leaving the chain smoking mother to try and cope with their unruly duo.  The mother is seemingly detached and is the childrens' emotional peer.  One does not read \\"adult\\" into her character.<br />The story plunges toward a free fall with everything to lose and nothing to gain.  That poor Honda was a casualty of irresponsibility and excess.  It was stupid to give Let a car, especially a top notch brand new car and a Honda at that in the first place.	2002-03-25

A local furniture store in my area has a female basset hound named Isadora Duncan (&quot;Izzy&quot;) hop onto a sofa to prove how soft it is (the couch, not the hound).

He does not disclose what took place during that agonizing last day they had together.<br /><br />Laf's middle brother, Charlie, has become more distant and angry. He burns all but two pictures of their mother. He joins a street gang and ends up serving time in jail. Once released, Charlie has become harder and meaner. The brother Laf remembered as having cared about animals and their mother has been replaced by this hostile stranger.<br /><br />Ty'ree has turned down a chance to attend M.I.T. in order to raise his brothers. He and Laf are closely bonded and they share a common loss -- Ty'ree was present when the boys' father died and his experience is a sad parallel to Laf's experience when Milagro (Miracle) died.<br /><br />Miracle's Boys each find their own voice and way of coping. The boys discuss their rich racial heritage and how others interact with them based on this. The boys' mother was from Puerto Rico and their father was black. Early in the book, Charlie discusses the racial hierchy of street gangs in their New York neighborhood.<br /><br />This is a gritty, loving and very serious book that will leave an indelible impression on all who read it.

Torey Hayden has truly raised the bar in working with children and has, in pioneer fashion, blazed new trails and set new standards.<br /><br />Sheila, a 6-year-old girl living in grinding poverty and raised by her single father faced some daunting odds when she entered Torey Hayden's special needs class.  Abandoned by her mother, beaten by her father and facing a court ordered sentence to a hospital after a particularly violent episode, Sheila was extremely aggressive and wary.  Since she had no bathing facilities in the home she shared with her father, Sheila was often dirty and underfed.  It is a true testament to her courage and Torey Hayden's belief and persistence that Sheila began confiding in her within 3 days of her classroom placement.  I like the way Torey Hayden started a grooming routine for Sheila, which positively impacted her behavior and interactions with others.<br /><br />Sheila entered that classroom under very inauspicious conditions.  The court ordered that she at least be educated until the state hospital opening was available.  In that class, Sheila flourished and even made overtures to her classmates, some of whom functioned well below age level.<br /><br />Luckily for all, Torey Hayden was able to to have the court recind the commitment order.  Sheila stayed in that class for the remainder of the year and made quantum leaps and bounds.  During an early testing session it was determined that Sheila had an IQ of 182.  This highly gifted little girl was able to express herself eloquently.  Quick to assess people and situations, Sheila had developed a survival mode early.  In that class she used her natural endowments to her advantage.<br /><br />The gifts this child had to offer and the gifts she received in that class are a song to the soul.  There is a poignancy about her courage.  She is, to a large extent, accepting of her life conditions and makes the best with available resources.<br /><br />This is a book that will evoke just about every possible emotion, from sadness to anger to cheering gladly.  The close of the term is indeed bittersweet; the parting of teacher and pupil is very moving indeed.  One sees the progress Sheila has made and marvels at what this child unknowingly had to give.just about every possible emotion, from sadness to anger to cheering gladly.

One Halloween, the girls, then in their teens make a stop at their neighbors', the Biddles, home on 10 Summer Street.  Kristin apparently witnesses an apparition that terrified her to the point of silence.  She would never disclose the sight that terrified her in that home.<br />Years later, Kristin has died under mysterious conditions, leaving behind a boyfriend and 6-year-old daughter, Dulcinea (Dulcie).  Themes of vision are rampant throughout the book; Dulcie is blinded after a bout with meningitis at age 3.  She can \\"see\\" Kristin and other spirits who have passed; once she and her father, Paine, return to Lily Dale from California Dulcie is the receipient of many strange visions indeed.<br />Even Dulcie's name reinforces the visual theme.  Dulcinea is the vision of the ideal woman in literature; her very spiritual sensitivity and heightened awareness suggests that her name is very a propos indeed.  Lovable, bright and verbally precocious, Dulcie manages to find a permanent place in the hearts of most people who encounter her.  Yet...<br />Was Kristin killed?  If so, by whom?  And who killed Iris, the former owner of 10 Summer Street?  What REALLY brought Paine and Dulcie to Lily Dale from California?  Who can they trust?<br />This masterfully written book is very compelling indeed and the characters will remain in the memories of all who read this book.  The series of mysteries are interlocked; each one segues into the next.  The writing is brilliant and one is always left several steps behind in trying to figure out just what will take place.	2002-03-20

This book is mainly about Jadie, who, at 8 is (s)electively mute, walks hunched over and expresses fears that initially seem bizarre.<br />At the opening of the book, Torey Hayden meets Jadie and her classmates after half term break.  Within a short space of time during that first day together, Jadie broke her self imposed silence and spoke softly when asked a direct question.  From that point on, Jadie's verbal progress is remarkable.  A bright, expressive child, Jadie described a bizarre life outside of the classroom that certainly makes for a strong case for ritual abuse.  Luckily Jadie was provided with a classroom environment in which she felt safe.<br />Jadie feared spiders because she believed they could hear her and \\"tell on her\\" if she divulged anything that could be construed as a breach of confidence.  She explained her posture as a means of \\"keeping her insides from falling out;\\" she fears the number 6 and worries about her younger sister surviving her sixth birthday; she said adults she knew told her how at six one gains power and how people can hurt others with impunity; she describes drinking blood as \\"oily\\" and \\"slipping down.\\"  Ghosts and themes of death are trenchant; many of Jadie's early drawings are of ghosts and she said that she and her little sisters were ghosts at night.  She also believed that a playmate who had allegedly died had become a ghost and that that child's ghost had gotten into her, Jadie.<br />Each fear she expressed can be traced to ritual abuse.  In many cases, ritual abusers claim that spiders as well as insects spy on children and report anything the children might tell.  Imbibing blood and other body fluids is often a cult activity and the number 6 has a long history of having dark magical properties attributed to it.  Jadie's fear that her sister would not survive past that age appears to underscore this belief.  Her strong aversion for Halloween is another good case in point as Halloween is considered a high holiday in cult circles.  Jadie wanted no part of it.<br />Another point that leans towards ritual abuse was Jadie's sexual precocity and acting out.  She described adult acts and even said how she and her sisters were so abused.  Although Jadie had a good command of language from the telling, the question remains as to what really took place.<br />This is a very chilling book that will certainly leave indelible impressions upon the minds of all who read it.  It is easy to make good cases for ritual abuse, but that is remains an open question.  Jadie was a very brave and soldierly little girl who tried to protect her sisters and explain a part of her life that can at best be described as hazy and shadowy.for Halloween is another good case in point as Halloween is considered a high holiday in cult circles.

They do reconnect after a series of &quot;lucky flukes&quot; some seven years later.  Sheila, then in middle school has more or less discarded any memory of her past; she is contending with living in a different town and is coping with her father, with whom she seems to have a better relationship.  In &quot;One Child,&quot; readers are made aware that both father and daughter had been wronged by the Social Services system.  This book helps readers to see how they survived the bureaucracy and made the best with what they had at the time.<br />Torey Hayden opens new doors for Sheila; she even recommends Sheila for a job in the clinic where she works one summer.  Sheila bonds with a young boy there because both share a common history of maternal abandonment.  The relationship between former pupil and teacher is certainly a roller-coaster ride; Sheila, now in the &quot;terrible teens&quot; is clearly feeling her way out towards independence and self identity.  She expresses these feelings eloquently and in action; she dyes her hair extreme colors and puts together exotic outfits.<br />Over time, as Sheila matures and contends with bad placements and more moves, she is able to come to terms with her past.  To both of their credit, no promises are made and one can more or less feel and see the process involved in helping Sheila cope.	2002-03-18

The protagonist, Lesley is at the opening of the story a 12th grader who has an unusually high level of maturity. In fact, she seems more believable as someone upward of age 25 than a minor still in high school!<br /><br />Lesley has plenty of issues to mature her. Her mother, Mara, a Hungarian WWII Holocaust survivor slips into a hazy state between delusions and reality; her sister Megan, then 9  whom I found spoiled and obnoxious is an added major challenge. I found Megan irritating, most insufferable and unpleasant and just could not like her. The girls' father, O'Malley, is a gentle, loving man who tries to smooth things over for his family.<br /><br />Mara, always a tad unstable, relives the atrocities she survived during the war years. Captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in a breeding farm, Mara loses the two sons she bears while in captivity. Her second son dies shortly after birth and her first son, Klaus, is whisked away never to be seen again. Mara never accepts losing this first child; once released, she spends the remainder of her life searching for him.<br /><br />Matters reach a critical head when Mara spies a neighbor's child and insists that he is Klaus. He goes along with her because he enjoys the attention and gifts he receives. Lesley tries to monitor Mara and balancing Mara and Megan (I thought Megan was just plain loathsome) is a juggling act that proves daunting.<br /><br />Mara is never able to accept the reality of her life and is ultimately consumed by her fantasies. The family sadly picks up the pieces after her death and Lesley decides to visit Wales, the place her parents talked about so fondly. Shortly after graduation, Lesley travels to Wales and is taken in by a young Welsh family. She learns that the place Mara spoke about so longingly, The Sunflower Forest was yet a distorted form of beauty. Although the Sunflower Forest is nothing like Mara's accounts, Lesley is still able to see beauty in the most daunting of conditions. It is in Wales that she accepts Mara, warts and all and even forgives her. It is in Wales that she learns about a side of her parents that had previously been undisclosed. It is in Wales that Lesley redifines beauty. It seems from the reading that Lesley learns that beauty can be wishes or feelings as opposed to what traditionally appeals to the eye. Her response to the mountains is similarly symbolic; the mountains, solid, grounded, seemingly insurmountable are naturally beautiful. Lesley metaphorically scaled many a mountain in the face of dauting odds and appears to identify with them. The mountains can be interpreted as a contrast to Mara; whereas they are fixed and grounded, Mara was sadly far from stability.<br /><br />Armed with this added wisdom, Lesley is able to feel more acceptance of others and share what she has learned.<br /><br />Despite Mara's mental fragility and the havoc she has caused, she unwittingly helped Lesley develop a more inclusive sense of \\"beauty.\\"s in Wales that she accepts Mara, warts and all and even forgives her.

Dorrie's big goal is to ride the bus with Robin on their first day of 8th grade.<br />Dorrie is not a likeable character and the story itself is not a plausible one.  This book certainly won't make any friends among anyone who reads it.  The ending doesn't make sense.  It is absurd and the only characters you can like are Robin and Dorrie's brother's dogs.<br />This book belongs in the wastebasket.	2002-03-09

She is in the 4th grade, has an older sister in college and another sister in middle school.  Helen, the middle girl was the only one I liked in this Saga of Sillyness.  Bright and independent, Helen is the only realist in that household.  The girls' dad was a shadow figure.<br /><br />I could not stand the girls' mother.  She was clingy and needy and singularly intrusive.  I didn't like the way she thought she could patch up Jessica's rift with another girl and literally buy her child friends.  I also didn't like the way she pretended to like Jessica's suggestion to do her room in a patriotic theme while subtly steering her away to what she, the mother wanted the room to look like.  Forcing that flokati rug on Jessica while pretending to let her make decisions really tore it for me.<br /><br />I also didn't like the way she would call Jessica for a hugfest while the child was getting ready for school.  It seemed to me that she could have at least waited until Jessica came home, rather than calling her over just as she was about to leave for school.<br /><br />Jessica does a lot of stupid and inane things.  She writes herself notes signed from &#34;a friend&#34; with the idea of luring other kids to like her.  Jessica was infantile and foolish and impossible to like.  A pie in the face for Jessica!	2002-02-27

Once he gained access to the boys, he chained them to a piece of plywood and subjected them to sundry atrocities before killing them. He prided himself on being a traveling mortician; he buried most of the boys in a shed nowhere near his property. Others were buried in secluded spots.<br />Corll's sick, twisted career is believed to have started in 1970 with the disappearance and subsequent deaths of Jerry and Donald Waldrup. Between 1970-1973 some 25 boys were discovered to have been killed by Corll. Two young men, Elmer Wayne Henley, Jr. and David Brooks were used to procure the boys for Corll. The depraved candy man even bought David a car for his efforts.<br />Matters came to a head when Henley allegedly shot Corll to death during the summer of 1973.

They worked tirelessly on their client's behalf and it is through their efforts that Ashley ended up in a hospital across country instead of in prison.<br />This tired story with its routine sexcapades (all Sidney Sheldon books have graphic sexual encounters), trashy story and tritely written plot is vintage, standard Sheldon.  Since it is about MPD/DID, it is not meant to be a diagnostic tool.  It is simplistic and surfacy and skates around this condition.

She is constantly compared to Cynthia and the emphasis placed on both girls is academic and later career success.  It is only in the horse world that Janet feels at home.

I didn't like the way her mother accused her of helping a boy humiliate Cynthia after he told Cynthia not to startle the animals.

She recounts a girlhood of music and dance lessons, all of which came to a grinding halt due to financial set backs.<br />She marries a gentle, self effacing man who, from the telling sounds ill equipped to cope with her hostility and demands.  When daughter Karen is born in late 1953, Helene is in for a rude shock.  Deaf, retarded and diagnosed with cerebral palsy, Helene is told to give Karen up.  One doctor encourages her to keep Karen; she ends up taking this advice.<br />The ensuing years are challenging ones.  A son was born a year after Karen and learned independence at an early age.  Helene's marriage ends and she blames Karen for everything that has gone wrong in her life.  Karen's early years were a round of physical therapy treatments, several months at Bird S. Coler Hospital on Governor's Island in N.Y.C. where she was left by herself for long periods of time, tied to a wheelchair.  Karen's life improves when Helene finds a residential school for her.  Karen, then 8, leaves home for the first time.  She thrives in the Pennsylvania school where she is toilet trained and taught sign language.  She remains in the school for several years, until she outgrows the programs there.<br />On the plus side, Helene strove to have Karen learn independence.  It was impossible to like Helene, but to her credit, Karen did surpass many expectations early experts held out for her.<br />Helene seeks jobs that emphasize beauty.  She takes temporary jobs in the interior decorating/design field until she finally becomes a designer.  Helene was the ultimate window dresser.  She dates frequently and even blames Karen for bringing one relationship to an end.  One memorable relationship with a man identified as \\"Alan,\\" is notable for its bizarre dynamics.  Alan, an infantile and dependent man feeds Helene lies about how a \\"Dr. Wolfe\\" is helping him work through his issues.  As that relationship deteriorates, Helene meets with Dr. Wolfe who tells her that Alan is a very dangerous man.  He also disclosed other personal tidbits about his former client.  This does not sound ethical at all.<br />During the years Karen was thriving in Pennsylvania, Helene's mother died.  When Karen sees her crying, instead of sharing her grief and bonding, Helene tells Karen to \\"forget her.  She has gone away\\" and whenever Karen cries, she tells her, \\"forget about crying.  You only smile.\\"  It was cruel to shut Karen out at such a time.<br />I didn't like the emotional blackmail she used on Karen.  When Karen was in her teens, Helene enrolled her in a large residential school.  Karen appeared to like the environment and was attached to the headmistress, but lived for her brief trips home.  Every time she asked to stay home, Helene would invariably respond with, \\"Don't you love your school?  How could you learn there if you were home?  How do you think that would make the others [at the school] feel?\\"  That was cruel and manipulative.<br />She admitted that she did not enjoy Karen or spending any amount of time with her.  During one of Karen's summer visits home, Helene went into a rage and beat Karen, then 20, and dragged her by her hair and held her over a window sill with the intention of dropping her.

He also disclosed other personal tidbits about his former client.  This does not sound ethical at all.<br />During the years Karen was thriving in Pennsylvania, Helene's mother died.  When Karen sees her crying, instead of sharing her grief and bonding, Helene tells Karen to \\"forget her.  She has gone away\\" and whenever Karen cries, she tells her, \\"forget about crying.

When Karen was in her teens, Helene enrolled her in a large residential school.  Karen appeared to like the environment and was attached to the headmistress, but lived for her brief trips home.  Every time she asked to stay home, Helene would invariably respond with, \\"Don't you love your school?  How could you learn there if you were home?  How do you think that would make the others [at the school] feel?\\"  That was cruel and manipulative.<br />She admitted that she did not enjoy Karen or spending any amount of time with her.  During one of Karen's summer visits home, Helene went into a rage and beat Karen, then 20, and dragged her by her hair and held her over a window sill with the intention of dropping her.

Cathy, an 11-year-old teetering on the brink of the \\"terrible teens\\" has learned to juggle some issues. She tilts at windmills and looks for excuses to rebel, such as insisting on riding a bike on the sidewalk instead of in the park.  She has a loving father, stepmother and stepbrother who is a year her senior. Her biggest ally is her paternal grandmother, who is a very astute woman.<br /><br />Cathy is very silly and infantile, even for eleven. She believes that her mother is dead and has no memory of her. Every year she leaves Manhattan for the bucolic tranquility of rural Maine, the home of her grandmother. In Maine she reconnects with her boy-crazy, irritating, not too bright friend Marianne. Marianne is really for the birds.<br /><br />Once ensconsed in Maine, Cathy meets a woman summering there. The woman has rented a cottage and asked Cathy if she would pose as a model for a children's book she is illustrating. Cathy jumps at the chance to model and earn money for a bicycle she wants to buy.<br /><br />The summer appears to drift along up to a point. Cathy's stepbrother Andrew and his delinquent friend Donny arrive towards the latter part of the summer. Marianne hooks up with Donny and entices the other two to eavesdrop on an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. It is there, in the darkness of a church parish hall that Cathy recognizes the woman she thought was just a summer resident in Maine. Masks come off and the results are...well, somewhat of a revelation.<br /><br />It is Cathy's wise grandmother who puts the pieces together for them all. She was the most appealing character. I like the intelligent conversations she had with her spoiled, silly and very immature granddaughter.  I also didn't like the way she playacted at \\"being a woman with a past\\" (talk about a very bad cliche) and quoted trite lines from old movies. Cathy was a very annoying, unappealing and tiresome character.  A pie in the face for Cathy!  Although I didn't like Cathy, I liked the way her extremely articulate grandmother brought truth and logic in where it was sorely needed.<br /><br />The wise, well-spoken grandmother was what kept this book from receiving 1.5 - 2 stars.brought truth and logic in where it was sorely needed.

Her older brother Tony, 16 and over-indulged cousin Brenda, 10 and indomitable mother, hound her mercilessly about her weight. To them all roads lead to Rome and Dinah baiting has become rather a cruel sport for them. Dinah has a loving father and younger brother, Jack, 9 as allies.<br /><br />That touchstone year Dinah develops other allies. She adopts a pug from a traveling shelter, she meets two elderly \\"husky\\" women and creates an imaginary world called \\"the green fat kingdom\\" where everyone is green and fat and thin is undesirable.<br /><br />Indeed, Dinah does need some inner reserves. She has a perfectionistic mother who makes life miserable for her. One of her more memorable blunders was to spring a nasty surprise on Dinah. She makes her attend a nutrition program which is conducted at a special school in their town. Dinah is simply told to take the town bus there and was given no advance warning. Another nasty trick was threatening to take her pug away if she eats any desserts during a 3-month period. Brenda is allowed to get a cat and keep it in the room the girls share. Brenda skates by with murder and does everything she can to make problems for Dinah.<br /><br />I didn't like the way Dinah's mother would lace into her in front of Brenda and constantly sing Brenda's praises. Dinah begs to move out of the room the girls share because she cannot stand \\"perfect Brenda\\" and her cat.<br /><br />My favorite part was when Dinah, sick of Brenda and her mother's hounding and brother Tony's razzing finally stood up for herself. She let this trio of jackals know just what they were doing to her before rushing out of the house with no intention of returning. \\"I could find the cure for cancer and it wouldn't matter because I'm fat...the only thing that matters to you is being thin...Maybe he's trying to get away from her...And I don't blame Brenda's father for staying away this year. If I were him I'd stay away forever.\\" Jack defends her and I cheered Jack!<br /><br />I also like the way Jack said that their mother's hosting a dinner for Brenda was \\"a stupid idea.\\" Brenda's father, an engineer had written her telling her he would be out of the country for one whole year. Since the girl's mother was dead, she was technically a ward of her aunt and uncle. The dinner is a bust, with everyone hounding and heckling Dinah save for Jack.<br /><br />Dinah runs to the home of the \\"husky women.\\" She has made friends with their nephew, who is her age. He attends the school where her nutrition counseling sessions are held; he has cerebral palsy. It is the three of them who convince Dinah she has to \\"go back home and fight it out\\" and that running away is no solution. Dinah reluctantly gives them her number and it is her father who comes to get her. During their long walk home, they clear the air between them. Once home, Dinah once again confronts her seemingly indomitable mother who finally relents and admits her behavior was reprehensible.<br /><br />Dinah is allowed to move into her own room and leave Brenda behind. She is also allowed to keep her pug. \\"I should never have held that over you. It was terribly stupid and terribly wrong,\\" Dinah's mother says after Dinah said she took her dog with her to protect him from being returned to the pound. It is during a \\"confessional\\" of sorts with her seemingly impossible mother that Dinah is empowered to make her own decisions and take charge of her own weight and weight related issues.<br /><br />Dinah is a lovable, sympathetic character whose pleas for respect and acceptance will certainly reevaluate one's response towards the weight of others.cheered Jack!

She travels to the North Pole and asks to pull the sled.  Santa wisely notices that the little Jack was not a reindeer and that working on his team was very important to her.

They share developmental milestones and secrets.  The gentle illustrations show the bond between the two; in one picture, the boy, then barely more than an infant mounts a toilet seat while his dog tinkles on the floor.  The parallel between the two and their developmental milestones from pup to dog and from toddler to older child are beautifully chronicled.<br />As Elfie ages, she is no longer able to romp and play.  Her stiffened joints and fatigue are taxed on her advanced age.  She is taken to a kindly vet, who says that he cannot treat her, but the best thing to do is make her happy and comfortable.<br />Elfie eventually dies and the boy sadly buries her after openly sharing his grief.  He vows that he will tell every pet he owns that he will always love that animal.<br />A wonderful book of healing and bonding; truly the best book dealing with the death of a pet that I have come across.  I think the message of telling a loved one, human or pet that you will always love them is a lesson worth learning.<br />Thank you, Mr. Wilhelm!	2002-02-09

Juliet is married to a playwright who provides a creative foil to her serious side.<br />Indeed, Juliet is never at a loss for creative energy and activity.  After failing to get Ruby accepted at a prestigious nursery school, Juliet literally walks into a mystery.  The school's founder and director is found murdered days after Juliet's encounter with her and Juliet is determined to crack the case.  The list of suspects is quite long -- a former husband, a current husband, an irate parent with questionable connections whose child did not get accepted into the school are likely suspects.  The internet offers clues to solve a seemingly interlocked set of mysteries.<br />I absolutely LOVED this book and can't wait for Waldman's next!

Bright, high spirited and wonderfully creative and original, the red haired moppet literally shakes up the Swedish village she lives in.  Blessed with incredible physical strength, Pippi lives alone and fends for herself.  Indeed, her strength comes in handy when she throws would be robbers into the air like pizza dough.  That part still makes me laugh!<br />She is a delightful, independent foil to her more timorous peers, siblings Tommy and Annika.  When they invite Pippi to their school, she dazzles all with her creative, hit or miss spelling, her misprounciation of \\"multiplication\\" (she insists on calling it \\"plutification\\") and her wild stories.  Indeed, Pippi has had her share of adventures.  Her seafaring father travels the 7 seas, often leaving Pippi to her own devices.  It is a good thing others are invited to travel along with Pippi!	2002-01-29

Astrid Lindgren always had strong, female characters that I could readily identify with and cheer and Meg is no exception.<br /><br />Bright and spirited, Meg is never at a loss for concocting well intentioned mischief.  She fashions a parachute out of an umbrella and jumps off the roof.  She suffers from a concussion and has to endure the gloating of her bratty little sister and the foolish housekeeper who gloatingly insist that it is not Meg who gets into trouble; rather, it is the mythical imp, \\"Sebastian Loki.\\"  The pair taunt poor Meg into a frenzy with their Sebastian stories, which I thought was mean.<br /><br />Meg rebounds and is back with a BANG!  In fact, she cuts her own bangs, defaces a picture of the Queen in one of her history books and blames her recent spate of mischief on a classmate named \\"Richard.\\"  As you have already guessed by now, there was no Richard.  Meg was just being..well, bright, irrepressisible, high spirited MEG!  I love her!<br /><br />I also loved the cultural enrichment this book provided.

Named for an apple, Annona Blossom Swope is described in almost feral terms.<br /><br />Matters come to a painful head when Woody is kidnapped from the  hospital.  The boy's parents and sister also disappear, and Dr. Alex Delaware is immediately in pursuit of this mysterious family.<br /><br />Dr. Delaware and his long time friend, Officer Milo Sturgis travel down some very seedy and unsavory roads in Southern California.  A cult called the Touch is high on the list of suspects.  Members of the cult would visit Woody's family in the hospital and were bringing fresh, organic fruits.  A doctor who sympathized with the Touch was high on the list of suspects as were a disgruntled male model/escort who worked with Nona at a messenger/escort service.<br /><br />The clever detective work and the chapters detailing Dr. Delaware's expose of the Touch and their compound, a converted monastery in the fictitious border town of La Vista make for very compelling reading.  The theme of bearing fruit is rampant throughout the book and is very effectively used.  Dr. Delaware's live in girlfriend, the selfish and tiresome Robin is barely mentioned in this story, which is also good.  I never cared for her.<br /><br />Questions still abound.  Where are the Swopes?  And what of Woody?  How was the Touch involved?  And what of the doctors who worked at the hospital where Woody was being treated?  A well crafted mystery that will certainly leave a lasting impression.	2002-01-29

Ray Coleman has written an objective, factual account of the late Beatle.  To his credit, Mr. Coleman does not languish during John's years as a Beatle; on the other hand, Coleman's book picks up steam and speed after the Beatle years have been explored.<br />Ray Coleman has plainy done his homework.  This work is well researched and explores the psyche and personality of John Lennon in all his humanity.  He does not make John to be anything other than human; he does not hammer home the point that as a human John had feet of clay; he does not enlarge John beyond his own artistic talents.  <br />The passages concerning John's murder in 1980 are handled in a factual and tasteful manner.  Coleman has done a good job in tracing the movements of John's assassin and the series of horrible events that culminated in John's untimely death.<br />This book will certainly leave readers with much to think about and has something to offer everybody.	2002-01-20

Books	5	14	25	N	N	Nothing to Kill or Die For	This well researched book explores a possible political component to the 1980 murder of John Lennon.  Outspoken and involved in political causes, the late former Beatle had a dossier by the FBI.  He was considered an insurgent rebel by many politicos of the day.<br />Bresler's book does an excellent job of following the man who killed John Lennon.  He accurately chronicles the assassin's movements during the latter part of 1980 and his boyhood overidentification with the former Beatle.  Bresler does not skip a beat, his work takes his readers along that sad, psychotic trail Lennon's killer took in late 1980.<br />The assassin, caught in a love-hate obsession concerning John Lennon appears to be confused about his own identity.  A former Beatles fan, the killer would, by 1966 turn against them because of John Lennon's comment that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus.  Irate and confused, the killer appeared to try to suppress his natural love for their music while justifying his hatred of John.<br />It is indeed the killer's behavior that calls attention to his desire to emulate the late Beatle.  The assassin marries a woman who is Japanese; he expresses an enjoyment for the same types of art and music that Lennon publicly endorsed.  By late 1980 the lines between reality and fantasy blurred; on his last day of work, the killer signed out of his company log book as &quot;John Lennon.&quot;  He then left Hawaii where he was then living for New York.  An extremely confused man, he overidentifies with Holden Caulfield, the young protagonist of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; infamy.  He, like Holden declares a moratorium against &quot;phonies&quot; and in his mind, John Lennon is one of those phonies  His fantasies ultimately consume him and the results are...devastating.<br />Bresler does an excellent job of chronicling the series of events that took place when and after John Lennon was murdered; he also does an excellent job of debunking many of the tabloid biographies of the day, e.g. Goldman and Guiliano's biographies of the late Beatle.  John's youngest son, Sean, for example comes down hard on the Goldman book which portrays John as punitive and uncomfortable around children as a &quot;total lie.&quot;  He said that John did indeed enjoy being kissed by Sean and his older half brother Julian and that Goldman's statement otherwise was untrue.<br />I was impressed with the accuracy and objectivity of this work.  It will certainly hold a reader's interest and is an invaluable source of information.  I'm lucky to have this.

Stripping the songs of the melody and notes, one can imagine the rhythm and flow of the words.  A master communicator, Paul McCartney writes poetry in the manner of the true virtuoso.  He plays upon the full range of senses and his work elicits the full range of emotions.  One poem in particular about a good friend who was born the same day as he was and who died young stands in poignant contrast to many of the other works included in this collection.<br />This is truly a rare and valuable gem.

It is interesting that Geoffrey Guiliano has managed to have each work he has submitted about the Beatles published.<br /><br />I think this book was poorly written and riddled with inaccuracies.  My chief complaint about it is that Mr. Guiliano appears to have an axe to grind where each Beatle is concerned.  This book is little more than tabloid journalism and a thinly veiled excuse to smear Yoko Ono.  What this author fails to realize is that Yoko also served as John's inspiration and who was a very strong and nurturing influence in his life.<br />I think most people are savvy enough not to waste their money on this book.  It is really the subject matter (John Lennon and John Lennon with the Beatles) that lures in readers.  I read this at the library and only wasted my time and not my money.<br /><br />It appears that one purpose of this book was to compete with the Beatles' own &#34;Anthology,&#34; which is truly a treasure and a delight.  How this author can purport to compete with the Beatles themselves and serve as their voice is questionable.<br /><br />Skip this book.  Instead of having this kind of tabloidesque work play mind games with you, read something of substance like Ray Coleman's biography of John Lennon, the Beatles' own &#34;Anthology&#34; and Fenton Bresler's &#34;Who Killed John Lennon&#34; instead.  Coleman and Bresler give good, objective and well researched accounts without relying on hearsay, e.g. &#34;someone told me,&#34; or &#34;this person told that person who told another person&#34; format.  This work by Guiliano is certainly not for the Beatle literati.	2002-01-17

The third of four children, young Clark was killing animals and abusing others in childhood.  He claims he committed his first murder at age 14 of a young boy in 1965.<br />Hadden's murderous appetite literally escalates.  His older brother Brad, also seriously disturbed did not show signs of his mental illness until he had reached adulthood.  In 1986, Brad had killed two women and cannibalized their remains.<br />Geoff, Hadden's second oldest brother abused his wife and children.  Once divorced, Geoff appeared to settle into a more mainstream lifestyle.  Alison, the youngest appeared to be the most stable of the four in adulthood.  Repeated episodes of running away from home and subsequent hospitalizations literally drove Alison away from her family.<br />That left Hadden.  Hadden, the overlooked.  Hadden, the cruel to animals and violent with peers.  Hadden of the bizarre non sequiturs.  Hadden, who had found no real niche.  An unsuccessful stint in the Navy did lead to what could have been a successful career as a chef.  Trained at one of America's top cooking schools, Hadden did secure good jobs only to lose them within a few weeks after a display of bizarre and/or violent behavior.<br />By 1986, Hadden, then 35 had literally divorced himself from reality.  At or around the time his older brother faced legal consequences for the brutal murders he had committed, Hadden appeared to be following suit.  He abducted and killed his niece's playmate because he was angry at his niece.  He trashed a landlord's home by stuffing rotten fish heads in the piano and furniture in retaliation for some imagined wrong.  He even went so far as to steal his landlord's daughter's Chinese language books.  Even when confronted with evidence, he maintained his innocence.<br />By 1992, Hadden was homeless.

The Michelangelo of Mysteries has once again crafted a superb, tautly written mystery.<br /><br />Dr. Alex Delaware comes in contact with a former client.  At one time, he treated Lauren Teague, then 15 and her parents.  Lauren was belligerent and performing poorly in her classes.  She appeared flippant and nonchalant during her two sessions with Dr. Delaware.  He feels he has made no inroads nor has he tapped into her psyche.  After two sessions, the girl's father terminates treatment.<br /><br />Some five years later, Dr. Delaware attends a bachelor party for a doctor he works with.  An adult party is being held replete with women staging a lesbian love show.  One of the girls is...Lauren!  Mortified, both doctor and former client try to pretend they don't recognize one another.  One day after the stag party, Lauren pays a visit to Dr. Delaware with a sketchy update of the direction her life has taken.<br /><br />Which direction DID Lauren turn?  Shortly after her reunion with Dr. Delaware, her body is found in a dumpster.  Who killed her?  Her roommate, Andrew, professes not to know about her career in prostitution.  Her professors claim to have minimal memories of her, yet her transcripts show high marks and a goal oriented approach.  Her mother and stepfather beseech Dr. Delaware and his friend, Officer Milo Sturgis to try and find her killer.  Lauren's father, remarried with young daughters, claims Lauren had always been hostile to him and it came as no surprise she turned to prostitution as a career.<br /><br />Lauren's death takes Dr. Delaware and Milo down some very strange roads.  A character bearing a close resemblance to Hefner of Playboy infamy and his family also appear to have an interest in Lauren's murder.<br /><br />A girl from a small town bore a personality resemblance to Lauren; a bright, attractive girl, the former Miss Olive Festival enrolls in a large university in Los Angeles and dedicates herself to her studies.  Within weeks of enrolling, Shawna, the former pageant winner disappears.<br /><br />Are the girls' disappearances linked?  Did Shawna and Lauren know one another?  What of Tony Duke, the skin mag mogul and his family?  Do they have any part of the girls' disappearance?  Who kills several people who knew Lauren?  Is this the work of one person?  As usual, Jon Kellerman manages to stay several steps ahead of his readers and the conclusions will catch readers off guard.<br /><br />I like the maturation and full literary development of his characters.  I also liked the fact that Robin, Dr. Delaware's long time lover had more or less receded to the background because I never liked her in the first place.  I found her irritating and selfish and I plain didn't like her.  She's nothing but a table companion and sex partner.  In all of the books where she and Dr. Delaware are together, the majority of their time revolves around food.  They go out to eat; they are at a restaurant; they are preparing a meal.  There is the occasional cliche sex scene.  Jon Kellerman writes with a keen sense of humor; his descriptions of people and his characters' impressions of one another are witty and very cleverly done.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece.dies.

Stowers.<br /><br />The author's life with Jana, the mother of his sons got off to an inauspicious start when he first realized Jana was pregnant. Anson was born in May of 1963 and developed normally the first few years of his life. When his brother Ashley was born in January of 1967, Anson, then nearly 4 appeared to take his brother's birth in stride. He also appeared to be unphased by his family's numerous moves within Texas and New Mexico due to the author's job offers.<br /><br />Problems arose first with Jana. Shortly after Ashley was born, she began writing hot checks, overspending on clothes and lying to the author about the origin of her purposes. She told flimsy lies about a \\"friend\\" buying clothes and deciding to give them to her, replete with tags. Bank notices and other embarrassing business problems helped weaken the already deteriorating marriage. By 1973, Stowers had moved out. Anson was then 10 and Ashley 6. The years 1973-74 were marked by numerous court wranglings in custody disputes. By early 1974 Stowers eventually gained custody of his sons after Jana insisted he come get them as she had packed all their belongings.<br /><br />In 1973 the male Stowers moved to the small Texas Hill Country town of Comfort, where they would be invited to sit on stage with singer Willie Nelson when he performed there. It was in this close knit community that the boys thrived. Anson became active in his school band and even made friends.<br /><br />By 1976 problems cropped up again. An ugly confrontation with Jana and her father over bad checks, Anson's shoplifting and Stowers' second marriage all served to strain the interpersonal relationships among them all. Stowers' second wife Sandy was an interesting paradox. On the one hand she is described as fiercely independent with her own interests, one of which was ornithology. On the other hand, she is described as highly infantile, prone to tantrums and door slamming sessions. One memorable episode had me cheering for Stowers when, tired of Sandy's babyish behavior and demands that he take care of her garden, took a stand. I like the way he went out to a farmer's market and purchased large quantities of produce so he \\"would never have to set foot in that doggone garden again.\\" I was irritated with Sandy's behavior.  Anson was openly defiant to her because she sang Ashley's praises and made negative comparisons between the boys.<br /><br />Anson responded to the 1976 custody hearing and his parents' marital discord by taking drugs and running away. It was during this period that Stowers moved the boys to Cedar Hill, a Dallas suburb. Some peace was achieved when he was awarded custody of the boys on June 15, 1977.<br /><br />Anson's life continued spiraling downward. He was expelled from 9th grade and a traumatic episode at a private school soured him on further education. More brushes with the law ensued and by 1979 Anson, then 16, stole a truck. On September 9, 1980 he received a 10-year sentence for car theft. He escaped from jail and his life became a litany of convictions and arrests.<br /><br />Sandy, too, spiralled out of control. Her standard response when crossed was to throw tantrums, hurl objects and break them. By late 1980, Stowers divorced her.<br /><br />By early 1981 Stowers' life was looking up yet again. In March of that year, he married a gentle, loving woman named Pat. Her sons and Ashley blended nicely; they were all loving and supportive of Anson and the bad road on which he traveled.<br /><br />Anson had never been able to really find his niche. On November 25, 1981 he stole another car; by 1984 he was released from jail. His swan song crime was the November 16, 1988 murder of his wife, Annette whom he believed set him up for a drug bust.<br /><br />Stowers appeared to do everything he could to help Anson. He counseled him, punished him, clearly explained the problems Anson was creating for himself. He offered a stable, loving home to both sons and was the one stable parent Anson and Ashley had during most of their boyhood years. His third wife, Pat, too, offered love and stability. Sadly, Anson remained on a crash course to self destruction.to both sons and was the one stable parent Anson and Ashley had during most of their boyhood years.

The author does an excellent job of bringing the black neighborhoods of Liverpool to the world's collective attention.  He also had the unique advantage of having an indirect connection with a Beatle -- his father and Ringo were coworkers!<br />The influence of black musicians on rock and roll has been well documented.  Spirituals and the blues segued into rock and roll.  In a recent interview, Paul McCartney himself said had it not been for the black musical pioneers, he and most other musicians would never have achieved the level of accomplishment they have today.<br />A riveting, well researched book.  The Beatles and their music brought people together and were certainly a unifying force among the masses.  I think this is something that will be treasured by all.	2001-12-04

It brings back memories of a fun cartoon that aired on Saturday mornings from 1965-69.  I remember when I was a very little girl, loving the cartoon.  My favorite part was the sing-a-longs because I could read the lyrics while the real Beatles (a recording of a song) sang.<br />This book is a treat any Beatles fan will love.  The stories behind those who created the cartoon, the input the Beatles themselves offered and the rationale for using American actors to do the Beatles' voices (&quot;American kids would find American voices easier to understand&quot;) and the individual characteristics of each animated Beatle.<br />Mr. Axelrod has done a wonderful service in providing us with this book.  It will not only bring back memories for those who enjoyed the cartoons, it will make everyone yearn to watch these cool cartoons and bring smiles to faces of all ages.  I agree -- I would have liked to see more color cells.  I am not disappointed; I am DELIGHTED.  This book is a wonderful gift and something that will bring joy to anyone lucky enough to receive it.<br />I give it two thumbs up, a round of applause and a hearty YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

John Lennon was not a martyr nor was he a demon.  Goldman appears to have an agenda; he appears to look for any possible way to demonize the late former Beatle.<br />John Lennon was not without his problems.  A highly gifted, high spirited and expressive boy, John's boyhood behavior can be described as hyperactive.  In today's world, John would most likely be categorized as ADD/ADHD.  Artistically gifted and creative, John appeared to be a right brained learner.  His behavior appeared to fit the classic profile of ADD/ADHD.  It is to his credit and the world's fortune that he had many artistic outlets to channel his energy and talent.  Merely reducing John's work to &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; records as another reviewer noted is to do all a grave disservice.  John the man was much more complex and multifaceted than any type of music can describe him.  In many ways, John defied description.  His talent and how he developed it throughout his life is something that many find interesting.<br />John was neither demon nor saint.  However, he was a deep and complex man and his talent spoke volumes.  Goldman appears to have nothing positive to say about the late Beatle; rather he appears to seek ways to tarnish John and reduce his life and career to the level of tabloid journalism.<br />My chief complaint about the Goldman book are the inaccuracies regarding dates and times.  The section covering John's untimely death in 1980 is choppily written; the dates covering John's assassin's movements during late 1980 are inaccurate and Goldman's account of John's death are at variance with other sources.<br />Skip this book.  Read Ray Coleman's biography of John Lennon instead.  Coleman is fair and objective and he did his homework concerning the late Beatle's life and times.  You might also want to read newspaper articles covering John at various points throughout his life until his tragic death in 1980 for accurate, objective information.	2001-12-03

Abbey Harmon (called \\"Hanover\\" the back of the book cover), 17, her parents and 10-year-old brothers Peter and Paul spend a summer in the sleepy Massachusetts town of Seacliffe.  Rife with history pertaining to the infamous Salem witch trials, Seacliffe remains enshrouded in mystery as does the house.  It has a history steeped in history related to the Salem trials; the illustrious Crane family built the house and supposedly their daughter Felicity was hanged for witchcraft.<br /><br />Abbey, a Manhattanite detests the summer home immediately.  She and her younger brother Peter sense something wrong in the summer house and sense the presence of spectors.  Her summer is brightened when a pen pal in Liverpool mails her a Beatles' single and pendant to match; she meets the shy, somewhat silly and immature Katie Kennedy and her older brother, Riley.<br /><br />Abbey is determined not to like anything or anybody in Seacliffe.  Her defenses get chipped away by the cheerful Katie and when Abbey discovers her steady in Manhattan has been seeing other people, she realizes that maybe Riley isn't so bad after all.<br /><br />The other discovery Abbey makes is in the history of the house.  It seems to have a link to the 1690s.  Katie knows about a closet in the \\"keeping room\\" that is really a link to that era.  Abbey goes through the closet, not unlike Lucy in \\"The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe\\" and uncovers some startling secrets.  The worlds of the 1690s and the early 1960s collide almost painfully, yet the author pulls it off with finesse.<br /><br />Questions remain.  Can history be changed?  Can Felicity be spared the hangman's noose?  What of those who knew Felicity?  And will Abbey return?  What parts do Riley and Katie play?  All in all, a masterfully crafted book that will certainly hold readers' interest, regardless of age.	2001-11-19

Bright, high spirited and irrepressible, Kate describes taxis and telephones, things her aunt and uncle and cousin have never seen.  She refuses milk, she climbs up on the stove (\\"that big beehive,\\" as she called it because of the shape) to hide up on the rafters, eating the sausages that hung there.  Her poor uncle is up in arms with his spirited young niece; Jansci, on the other hand is captivated by her.  Active, agile and daring, Kate is fearless.  She takes to horseback riding and encourages her more timorous cousin to ride across the Hungarian plains with her.

The story opens in 1985 when the then 15-year-old Nancy tires of conforming and presenting a seemingly wholesome image.  She adopts the punk trappings of the 1980s, yet she offers a softening contrast to the hardened, nihilistic 1980s look with her love for 1970s rocker, David Bowie.

Katie is the one friend Nancy feels she can depend on.  But can she?  Katie's cutting escalates to an extreme level and Nancy has to recognize what coping mechanisms she has.

He lives with his almost nonexistent mother and his adopted brother, Mark.  An accomplished car thief (\\"nothing to hot wiring,\\" according to him) and lover of fights, Mark is bad news.  Byron describes him in an almost feral way; Mark had leonine coloring and features and his most outstanding feature is his amber colored eyes.  Being with Mark is like a roller-coaster ride.  Byron enjoys the excitement  that living on the edge with Mark can bring.<br /><br />The characters are sharp and richly drawn as is the Oklahoma town of the mid-1960s where the story takes place.  One gets a strong, compelling sense of the characters and the dividing line in their immediate community.  The \\"Greasers,\\" so called because of their love for Elvis and tendency to use hair grease are looked down upon because they live on the \\"wrong side of the tracks,\\" the east side of town.  The Socs, (short for \\"Socialites\\") on the other hand are their affluent West Side counterparts.  Byron falls hard for a socially mobile girl and takes her little brother, nicknamed M&M under his wing.  The girl later ends up dating Byron's friend, the weirdly named Ponyboy who is in Byron's social circle.<br /><br />The kids in this work, as in all of S. E. Hinton's works are highly independent.  Adult characters are peripheral at best.  The story is really about the young people in the Oklahoma community and their issues, confrontations and interactions.  S. E. Hinton's books during this time period tend to be juvenocracies, that is ruled by youth.<br /><br />Guns, drugs and violence are all part of the story.  The conflict between the Socs and the Greasers is like \\"West Side Story\\" with bite, punch and gritty attitude.  I love it!<br /><br />S. E. Hinton is a highly gifted writer.

Hinton Collection: The Outsiders & That Was Then, This is Now	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A TIMELESS CLASSIC	I have loved this book since I was a child.  It is one I treasure today.<br />Ponyboy Curtis and his equally weirdly named older brother, Sodapop live with their oldest brother, Darrell.  The boys' parents are dead and Darrell scrapes by at a minimum wage job to make ends meet.<br />The brothers live in Oklahoma during the mid-1960s.  Called &quot;Greasers&quot; because of their love for Elvis and hair grease, these boys are socially defined by their residence.  They are considered &quot;from the wrong side of the tracks.&quot;<br />The &quot;Socs,&quot; short for &quot;Socialites&quot; are the more affluent kids who look down on the greasers.  Ponyboy is friendly with a Soc girl, thus crossing social boundaries.  He is equally friendly with other greasers, including Byron, a very bright and literate boy and his adopted brother, Mark.  Mark ends up in jail and Byron graduates from the large high school he attends with Ponyboy.<br />Both boys share the love a quasi-soc girl.  Her brother, called M&amp;M is a brilliant boy who falls prey to drugs and hard street living.<br />The characters are sharp and well defined as is their neighborhood.  The story is indeed compelling and many of these same characters are revisted in &quot;The Outsiders.&quot;<br />S. E. Hinton's books make me think of &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot; with attitude.  I love her works.	2001-11-01

One-year-old Cassandra Brooks has been hospitalized repeatedly.  She appears to be thriving in the hospital, but once she is returned home, problems crop up.  Her loving mother dotes on her and almost never leaves her side.<br /><br />The question of Munchausen by Proxy is seriously investigated.  Is baby Cassie being injured and made ill by her mother so she, Cassie, will receive extra attention from hospital personnel?  Is someone in the hospital harming the baby?  Is Cassie just naturally susceptible to illnesses?  These are the questions that keep the story moving and readers riveted.  Cassie is an interesting baby; her father is an heir in a family known to have acquired their wealth by hard work.  She is a member of the \\"nouveau riche,\\" and money is certainly a possible motive regarding her frequent hospitalizations.<br /><br />Dr. Delaware and his partner in crime busting/crime solving Milo Sturgis are back in force, this time to find answers to the baby's mysterious illnesses.  Sadly, Dr. Delaware is still saddled with his tiresome lover Robin Castagna.  I never liked Robin and I'm tired of how the majority of her time with Dr. Delaware is spent eating, going out to eat or preparing a meal.  Despite her job as luthier to the stars, she also is a very inane, irritating and shallow character.<br /><br />Dr. Delaware once again makes the rounds to crack the Case of the Sick Baby and related cases.  This is truly an excellent mystery and avid Dr. Delaware fans won't be disappointed.  I know I wasn't.  I highly recommend this one.	2001-10-30

She scrapes to make ends meet for her two daughters, Beth 3, and Tina, 2.<br /><br />Her luck seems to change when she meets the charismatic Erich Krueger at an art gallery where she works.  She is literally swept off her feet by Erich and subsequently marries him.  They leave Manhattan for Erich's ancestral home in Granite Springs, Minnesota.<br />Once in Minnesota, alarming facets of Erich's personality appear.  His relentless obsession with his dead mother, Caroline and his constant references to her are alarming.  It is interesting that he applies no maternal name to her; she is always &#34;Caroline.&#34;  Caroline at the start of this story has been dead for over 25 years, having died in 1956 when Erich was then 10.  (The story is set in 1981-83).  Erich insists Jenny dress like Caroline; wear Caroline's aqua colored gown to bed; use the same pine scented soap Caroline used and in general, replace the mother he lost at 10.<br /><br />More cracks appear in Erich's seemingly flawless armor.  Mysterious deaths are part of the Granite Springs home.  A young woman disappeared some 10 years earlier and is presumably dead; dogs also were presumably killed and Jenny and Erich's baby dies a mysterious death.  Jenny's daughters say that Jenny killed their brother, that she &#34;covered his face with a blanket.&#34;<br /><br />But did she?  Jenny doubts this.  She also has doubts in Erich, who kidnaps the girls and hides even more terrifying secrets on and around the property.  Life with Erich, as Jenny was to discover was a chilling portrait etched in terror.<br /><br />Definitely worth 10 or more stars.  This is my favorite book by Mary Higgins Clark.	2001-10-29

The clinic itself is a rather gothic institution, replete with guards and other questionable personnel.

The housekeeper nurses her own son William and Page's younger sister as they are close in age.<br />Page prides herself on not being a bigot. Loved and nurtured by her housekeeper and playmate to William, Page feels that she does not discriminate against people who aren't white. She marries Jackson Lucien Yarbrough, a powerful southern politician. Their daughter Cindy is born in 1994 and son, Jackson Adams (\\"Adam\\") Yarbrough II, named after Lucien's father is born 10/6/01.<br />Adam, a beautiful healthy baby is indeed a surprise bundle of joy. He is black, beautiful and full term. Lucien and Page claim they cannot possibly be the parents to this child. Lucien storms into the nursery and demands that the nurses on duty disrobe each child so he can \\"find his white son.\\" After several weeks and DNA tests are conducted, Page is genetically determined to be Adam's mother. Lucien is not the father, so the curtain rises on the mystery stage. Who IS Adam's father? How could Page give birth to a black child when the only man she was ever with was Lucien?<br />A cruel, vindictive and even racist man, Lucien divorces Page, humiliates her publicly, strips her of her belongings and even secures custody of Cindy. The town bigots unceremoniously drop Page from the genteel southern organizations she belongs to such as the Garden Club.

Bloodlines, blurring of colors along racial lines and some surpise witnesses and references to related cases make for a brilliant and highly satisfying book.<br />I can't recommend this highly enough.

A bitter sister of one murdered woman; a strange boy in the neighborhood who has an even more bizarre hobby; a jealous husband; any number of possible relatives and acquaintances of the murdered women.<br /><br />The characters are richly drawn and believable; the descriptions of interactions between parent and child was refreshing and delightful and the conclusion, while not surprising was very satisfactory and masterfully crafted.<br /><br />I'm so glad I have this book!	2001-10-16

The Darts and Valiants set new standards and certainly raised the bar in automotive production.  It is also a real treat for people who like muscle cars.

Lynn Johnston has raised the bar in cartoon standards and her realistic strip with sympathetic, believable (save for April) characters remains nonpareil.<br />I never liked April.  She has a very fresh mouth and a nasty attitude.  A sneaky, spoiled brat April never helps around the house, destroys her sister's property and has never once taken responsibility for her behavior or been punished.  Her babyish speech long after infancy (e.g. &quot;gots&quot;) does not make her an appealing character; the lastest April themed story line involving her and a bully named Jeremy further point up how nasty April really is.  She makes up a vile, mean spirited song about Jeremy and in effect is asking for it.  She has yet to be held accountable for her behavior.  April is just a brat.  I just can't like her.	2001-09-08

Born 7/1/66, Noah never really mastered verbal communication, his toileting remained hit or miss and he could not really be engaged in any social activity.  Noah's older brother, Karl (b. 11/64) is, in the author's word, &quot;wonderfully unremarkable,&quot; a normal foil to Noah's challenges.  Karl understandably wants a normal, healthy brother and vacillated between anger at Noah and affection for Noah.  In one poignant entry, Karl, then 6, tells Josh not to institutionalize Noah because he loves Noah.<br />The Greenfelds leave the suburb of Croton, New York for Southern California in search of a helpful program for Noah.  Josh, a screenwriter and his wife, Foumi, also a writer find their niche in California and Karl forges out a group of friends.  Noah endures the gamut of programs from operational conditioning to short term instituitionalization, which is outlined in &quot;A Client Called Noah.&quot;  Irate over the poor treatment Noah went through, the Greenfelds have their son removed from the institution and a round of searches begins anew.<br />Prior to this drastic decision, Foumi begins an after school program for developmentally delayed children in their community and Noah is one of their pupils.<br />This book covers the years 1972 - 1977 when Noah was nearly 6 until he had just turned 10.  The time period shows the woefully inadequate plans and the overall lack of knowledge in austism with multiple challenges.	2001-08-21

Noah, born 7/1/66 exhibits behavior that can best be described as severely autistic; he functions well below age level and has been labelled brain damaged in addition to autistic.<br />The first book in the trilogy, &quot;A Child Called Noah&quot; is a chronicle of hope transformed into despair over the lack of progress and rapid deterioration in Noah.  This book covers the years 1966-1971 and one shares the anguish of this family who cannot reach this boy.  Karl, Noah's older brother (b. 11/64) serves as a &quot;normal foil,&quot; for Noah; from the author's own descriptions, Karl stands in stark contrast to his unchanging, noncommunicative, multiply challenged brother.<br />In the second installment, &quot;A Place For Noah,&quot; the author vents his rage at Noah's condition, at the professionals with whom they have come in contact with and at Noah himself.  He is irate over Noah's lack of progress and the unsatisfactory programs where Noah was then enrolled.  His anger is palpable; one feels the rage he poignantly expresses.  He lashes out at Noah; on 6/4/73 he says that by that time the following year, Noah will definitely be placed in an institution because it will be the best thing for him, Josh and that he &quot;has to get rid of him.&quot;  In his 5/19/76 entry, he angrily raps Noah's knuckles when the boy tries to take his toast; he kicks him from behind when Noah is not looking.  His anger flows throughout this book.  He stops &quot;chasing doctors&quot; for Noah; he fights valiantly for both sons to have good, appropriate educational programs.  His battles have borne some fruit; by 1976 his wife Foumi runs an after school program for developmentally delayed children in their area.  This book covers the years 1971 - 1976/7.<br />In &quot;Client,&quot; which opens in January of 1977 and closes in 1980, the author finally says that he is able to accept Noah.  Noah is briefly institutionalized.  Irate over the poor care Noah is receiving, the Greenfelds withdraw him and their search for a satisfactory program begins anew.  By the early 1980s, the Greenfelds purchase a second house where Noah resides with a battery of caretakers.  For some years this arrangement appeared to be helpful.  Karl runs into his share of problems, including brushes with the law in 1979.  He resented the chronicles, telling the author that he cherished his privacy.  It is for Karl's sake the book ends in 1980, with a very sketchy update of the intervening years 1980 - 1986.<br />What makes the &quot;Noah&quot; trilogy so poignant is that it is told entirely from a parent's hard wrought experience; Josh Greenfeld was actively involved in all phases of parenting Karl and Noah during a time when very few men did, e.g. custodial/infant care.<br />Noah, from all accounts did not show significant progress in any social, cognitive or affective sphere; by 1990 he was institutionalized in a state hospital in Orange County.

His story, told from the pages of his own father's diary, is a chronicle of heartbreak and sorrow over watching this child deteriorate in his development.  Noah does not walk until he is 27 months old; his speech, seemingly normal the first year of his life virtually comes to a grinding halt before he stops walking; he engages in bizarre, self-stimulating activities such as lint-chasing, curtain chewing and finger flexing.  Josh laments that for every accomplishment Noah makes, another skill is lost.  Noah is nonverbal for the  most part during the years 1966-1971, the period this book covers.<br />He is not fully toilet trained, does not engage in activities with others and remains an enigma to his parents, the professionals and his brother Karl who was born 11/64.<br />The author of this book is also a screenwriter.  One of the things that make his &quot;Noah trilogy&quot; so unique is that he was a father who was actively invovled in taking care of the boys as a stay at home parent during a time when that was extremely rare.	2001-08-21

He loved making up stories and playing with dogs. Creative and artistic, Eric loved to draw and was quite adept at drawing detailed cowboys. He enjoyed a good joke on his brother Michael who was 2 years his senior. In short, Eric (nicknamed \\"E\\") was a normal boy.<br /><br />At 4, Eric was diagnosed with leukemia. His distraught parents and brother sought ways to make the treatments Eric underwent more palatable. One clever method they devised was to tell him that his medications were like \\"superheroes\\" that warded off the evil illness. Michael, to his credit continued treating Eric like a healthy sibling and the pair displayed refreshingly normal bouts of sibling rivalry.<br /><br />I didn't like the way Terry Pringle would brush Michael off when Michael expressed resentment over the extra attention Eric was receiving. In one memorable scene, the author tells the resentful Michael to \\"shut up\\" and that he went outside to get away from the boy. Ouch! I also didn't like the way he criticized Michael for describing a nightmare he had had shortly after Eric's death in October, 1981. Nightmares were a normal response to the tragedy and trauma this child had undergone. A bright, imaginative child, it was only natural that this young boy's subconscious would conjure up frightful images after losing a brother.<br /><br />Just after moving from Austin to Abilene, Eric got in the habit of saying, \\"That's it, I'm moving back to Austin\\" whenever displeased. That got old fast and what helped move it from cute to tiresome was when Terry Pringle kept that one going.  I felt that line was over-praised.<br /><br />It bothered me when Terry Pringle told a story with Eric as the hero and Michael as the villain. Although Michael outwardly took it in stride, one could not help but wonder what message such a story sent to Michael. I didn't like it when Terry Pringle made Michael the villain in the story.<br /><br />This book was moving. One kept hoping Eric would pull through. Still, one couldn't help but feel guilty at being angry with the father throughout the book.

This is ghastly and appalling and slander, plain and simple.  It is bad enough that the author neglects to do his homework.  Inaccuracies regarding dates and other documented facts abound; slanderous attacks against Paul McCartney's wife Linda are numerous.<br />Although I am an inveterate Beatles fan, I do not regard the Beatles as &quot;sacred cows.&quot;  It isn't so much that the author has thrown negative items into the mix.  It is his approach.  He appears to be looking for anything he can to smear the McCartneys.  This is disgraceful!  I am so glad I borrowed this from the library instead of wasting my hard earned money on it.<br />What this author fails to realize is that Paul and Linda have contributed so much to the world at large.  Paul used his artistic talents and natural intelligence and Linda her love for children, animals and environmental issues.  They were clearly a rock solid couple and loving parents to their children.  Theirs is truly a story of love, commitment and respect for one another.<br />The author appears to have a real axe to grind and one cannot help but wonder why.

Those are the KINDEST words that can be applied to Cathy.  She is truly a villainess.  She is Olivia's granddaughter, all right.  The same unquenchable thirst for revenge and the same cruel streak that colors her personality.<br />Her oldest son Jory is a goody two dancing shoes and is boring and clueless for the most part.  Jory's wife is a tired, pathetic cliche.  She is a weak character who is very foolish like Alicia before her.  Cathy's brother and lover Chris is a good man who allowed himself to make bad decisions, such as having a long standing incestuous relationship with his disgusting sister.<br />Cindy, 16 at the opening of the story which is set in the late 1990s is Cathy and Chris' adopted daughter.  A spoiled little tart, she takes advantage of anything and everyone and does some really stupid things.  One singularly stupid act was for her to entertain a lover in the house where her \\"parents\\" and \\"brothers\\" were.  Why she didn't check into a motel with the guy or at the very least lock her door remains a mystery.  Of course we have a shadowy figure from the past.  Bart is the only main character one could like.  Cathy still treats him like dirt.  The best part was when Bart spanked Cindy after she tried to spoil his party by dressing like a tart and humiliating him.  She taunts him and Bart shows incredible restraint with this silly brat.  Cindy was truly loathsome and odious, like Cathy.  The best exchange was when Bart tells odious Cathy that \\"you all see what's wrong with me, but you close your eyes to the sins of your favorites!\\"  He was right.  Cathy was a monster who belonged in the compost heap.<br />The attic again.  The issues that launched the horrendous \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" play a \\"swan song\\" appearance in this last book.  Fortunately, Cathy sang her swan song.  She was for the birds.	2001-07-29

She doesn't take into consideration that Malcolm rapes Alicia and this act results in the birth of Alicia's daughter, Corinne.  Malcolm insists on naming his baby Corinne after his dead mother.  During Alicia's pregnancy, Olivia keeps her away from her son Chris (who would later, with Corinne, become the parents of the Dollanger 4) locks her away in the attic (the attic again)!<br />Alicia is a fool for allowing Olivia to spirit Chris away and even more foolish for letting Olivia keep Corinne in that malignant household.

To make a bad story worse, Cathy locks Bart in the attic (again with the attic)! until Chris frees him.<br />I was glad when Bart cut Cindy's hair and I loved the way he stood up to that disgusting Cathy.  Too bad the Child Protective Services couldn't have freed him from that loveless monstrosity.

Louise has founded the Beatles' Museum in Illinois where she had lived for some years and her contributions of Beatle facts and memorabilia is invaluable and greatly appreciated by many.<br /><br />In September of 1963, George and his older brother, Peter visited their sister who had by then emigrated to the U.S. At that time, George was the only Beatle to have made a transatlantic trip. His sister Louise provides a fresh voice, humor and delightful additional input about her famous brother and the people such has herself and their brother Peter who, undoubtedly helped influence George. I like the way she included a map of the Benton area and a list of places George got to visit during his trip. I also like the way she encouraged local radio stations to play the Beatles' then current hit, \\"She Loves You,\\" which is one of MY favorite songs.<br /><br />What adds to the appeal of this book is the loving tone in which it is written. The youngest of four children and the youngest of four Beatles, George was plainly well loved. One feels drawn into a loving vortex when reading this work. This book is very soothing and delightful; it is a book that will engender good feelings when read. This delightful book will be treasured from the inveterate Beatles' fan to people becoming familiar with their musical, artistic and cultural influence.

Just knowing this makes one respect Gracen all the more.<br />Please read this book.  The photographs are outstanding.  You will be very glad that you did.	2001-06-26

However, I didn't like the protagonist, a sulky 20-year-old named Jessica who is mourning the loss of her summer due to a required make up course in order to graduate.  She opens her door to a former school counselor and, in a very implausible series of events has an intimate relationship with the man.  It turns out his wife had recently died and he was checking up on Jessica.  The events leading up to the affair are almost ridiculous, including the scene where Jessica cuts his hair.<br />To make a bad story even worse, Jessica's mother had had an affair with the man many years before and he still carried a torch for her.  It seemed imprudent and ridiculous for him to disclose this fact to her.<br />I didn't like Jessica and I found her quasi-irreverant comments about Catholicism highly distateful.  In fact, Jessica was distasteful and I hope this is a self contained story.  Jessica was for the birds.	2001-06-18

Kennedy	Books	5	14	15	N	N	HISTORICAL MISSIVES - A PEEK BEHIND THE CURTAIN	Famed patriarch Joseph Kennedy Sr.'s granddaughter, Amanda Smith (she is the daughter of Jean Kennedy Smith) did an extraordinary job of collecting missives written by various family members over a period of nearly half a century.  The years 1914-1961 are meticulously laid out in militarily neat precision; it is through these letters that readers glean insights into the dynamics of a famous family.<br />My favorite parts in the book were the letters to, by and about the late Senator Robert Kennedy.  Third son and seventh child of patriarch Joseph Kennedy, readers are treated to witness his growth and development, almost from the beginning.  A composition he wrote at age 13 describing himself and his preferences is enlightening.  One can smile at the boy who strove to keep up with his older siblings revisited in the man who achieved leadership status.  From all accounts, Robert Kennedy was a diligent worker; the boy who sought to make himself heard by his siblings and by Joe, Sr. became the man who served as the voice for many.  In adult life his voice was one that was very much heard and resounded throughout history. In reading this, it was impossible not to cheer his progress and feel encouraged by what he accomplished in his lifetime.<br />This is a delightful &quot;peek behind the curtain&quot; into the dynamics of generations of Kennedys.<br />I loved it.	2001-04-19

He had an impressive resume -- mafia prosecutor, Attorney General 1960-1964, Senator 1964-1968 and presidential candidate, 1968.<br />Edelman contrasts the fiery idealism of the 1960s with the seemingly more jaded approach towards political issues in recent times.  To his credit, Edelman treats Robert Kennedy with respect.  During his career in public office, Robert Kennedy was the advocate of disenfranchised persons.  He encouraged people to work together as a community and seemed to feel that group efforts towards a common goal would ameliorate many societal ills such as poverty and bigotry.<br />While Edelman praises the late Senator, he appears to take a rather condemnatory posture with President Clinton, whose tenure in office (1992-2000) came some 30 years after the incindiary activism of Robert Kennedy's times.  Edelman does not appear to take into account that due to the different issues and questions of the times, the approaches that seemed to work in one era might not work in another.  It is just an opinion.  Times usually dictate the responses and approaches that are made toward issues.  Although Edelman knew both Robert Kennedy and President Clinton, he seems to view them as a study in contrasts.  The former was a passionate activist and the latter a jaded politician.  Edelman seems to take the position that persons currently in public office take a more opportunistic approach than those who held high public office in the 1960s.<br />All in all, this is a very well written book that will leave readers thinking about it for a long time.	2001-04-19

He plainly cared about Robert Kennedy and treats him with respect.<br />This book covers the 1968 campaign when Robert Kennedy, then a senator ran for the presidential election.  The best part of this book was the way the late Senator's supporters mobilized and are described in detail based on the groups they represented, e.g. ethnic groups, political groups, youth, etc.<br />Readers who encounter this book do come away with the feeling that the late Senator certainly did care about people and was sincere in his efforts.  His desire to share his vision of a more unified nation, to blend barriers of divisions are covered.

The author provides information about the man's background, all but complimenting him on becoming a self made man with requisite leadership abilities.  Hoffa is clearly intelligent, but he is also underhanded and wily.<br />Enter Robert Kennedy.  A hard working, driven man who will stop at NOTHING to see Hoffa indicted.  He feels Hoffa is the living definition of evil and that organized crime is social malignancy. He moves in on Hoffa with the skill and precision of a fencer, waiting to make that final jab.  He scores points in the courtroom interrogating Hoffa, et al. and incurs the wrath of the mafia.<br />The heat is on...the tension is felt on both sides.  Spectators are, thanks to the sympathies portrayed by the author, rooting for...Robert Kennedy!  One cheers his harsh questioning of Hoffa and other mafiosi; one smiles at how he and Hoffa feuded over picayune things such as who left the lights on in their offices longer.  Both men engaged in spitting matches such as this.  The spitting matches escalated as the &quot;blood feud&quot; between the Teamster/mafioso and the attorney became more public.<br />I rooted for Robert Kennedy.	2001-04-10

All aboard!  The train will be making nationwide stops.  It's the Equal Opportunity Train!  Join Robert Kennedy and supporters as he makes stops across country during his 1968 Presidential Campaign.<br />Tagged by detractors as being ruthless, the Senator's supporters lighten the charge by doing a parody of the &quot;Wabash Cannonball,&quot; called the &quot;Ruthless Cannonball.&quot;  Robert Kennedy, then a senator, had lived with the charge of ruthlessness since his days as a young attorney prosecuting Teamsters and mafiosi.  In fairness, the Senator does not appear to be ruthless.  He appears to be a very determined, committed, goal oriented, compassionate and often driven man.  He was the man who was credited with helping unify groups of disenfranchised persons; he was the advocate and voice for many.<br />Witcover's clear, precise writing literally places his readers on board that 1968 campaign train.  In reading this book, one almost wants to cheer, &quot;Hop on board the campaign train!  Next stop, VICTORY!&quot;<br />Sadly, the last stop was in Los Angeles the night of June 5, 1968 when Senator Robert Kennedy was assassinated.  This book does an excellent job of discussing the tragic aftermath of the Senator's assassination and yet the question will always remain -- what would this truly good man have accomplished had he lived to be elected president in 1968?	2001-04-10

The fresh start in Maine appears to be the change Creed yearns for.  A bad relationship with his father-in-law, the redoubtable Irwin Goldman and soured on city living, Maine appears to be the answer to his questions.<br />Set in 1983-1984, Creed appears to be the picture of the 1980s YUPPIE (Young Urban Professional).  Established in his career with the ability to relocate also point up to this very positive, professional image.<br /><br />Each character is drawn with realistic words; each character becomes vivid and believable, again evidence of a master storyteller.  My favorite part in this book was Creed's \\"last happy day, 3/24/84,\\" the day he spent flying kites with Gage, then just 2.<br /><br />Once settled in Maine, life and death appear to shift and the line dividing the two becomes blurry and indistinct, thanks to King's superb storytelling.  A graveyard for pets dating back to the early 20th Century is near the Creed home and a very chilling secret lurks there.<br /><br />Death appears to lurk in every corner of the small town.  First, the Creed cat is killed by a truck on the truck infested roadway near their home.  Gage is killed in May of 1984 after he darts away from Creed and into the path of an oncoming truck.  Rachel describes the agonizing death of her older sister Zelda in 1965 when Zelda was 10 and Rachel 8.  Rachel's fear of death causes her to lash out at Creed when he gently explains the death of the cat to Ellie; she refuses to attend a neighbor's funeral and barely gets through Gage's.<br /><br />Creed uncovers the mystery of the Pet Sematary (so spelled by local children who have buried their pets there) and uses what he has learned to make the dividing line between life and death questionable and indistinct.<br />This is one of King's best stories!	2001-04-06

Schlesinger knew him personally and was able to offer many enlightening insights on the man's character.<br />Robert Kennedy was a man whose core appeared to be diligence.  An intelligent, intense and often serious man, he often appeared to be driven.  His driving intensity was readily apparent in all aspects of his life.  He appeared to take recreational activities seriously, e.g. football which he played with great zeal.  He takes that same zeal and applies it to his interrogating and pursuing Teamsters and Mafiosi; he is equally zealous and driven during his tenure as Attorney General (1960-1964) and later as a Senator.<br />Schlesinger chronicles the man's life from the beginning; he describes Robert Kennedy's academic career, which, too was marked by laborious effort.  Letters from and to him from various family members are included; these missives do point up to a strongly developed person.<br />In many ways Robert Kennedy was a self taught man.  The boy who really had to apply himself as a student became well versed in classic literature by adulthood.  Robert Kennedy could quote long passages from authors such as Aeschylus, Camus and Sophocles by heart; he was able to draw from a myriad of esoteric sources.  The man who admitted that for most of his life he &quot;did not lie awake nights concerned about the plight of minorities,&quot; would later become a strong advocate for the disenfranchised.  He educated himself in civil rights related issues and served as the voice of many.<br />His death leaves a painful void in history.  Schlesinger appears to stop short and gives a very minimal account of the Senator's death.  In reading this particular work, one cannot help but feel that Schlesinger just could not bring himself to recount the Senator's death in 1968.<br />Indeed, the death of Robert Kennedy has left many gaping questions unanswered.  This, as with any work on his life makes one wonder what might have been had he lived to win the 1968 Presidential Election.

This particular work focuses on the last years of Robert Kennedy's life and his career in politics.<br />Elected N.Y. Senator in 1964, Robert Kennedy was literally coming into his own.  Prior to his successful senatorial election, he was the Attorney General during his older brother's tenure in office.  Fortunately Robert Kennedy is not eclipsed by his brother, President John Kennedy in this work.  Halberstam shows how Robert Kennedy came into his own.<br />Confronted with making decisions without his brother's input was a big and bitterly painful adjustment the Senator had to make; indeed, winning the 1964 election had to be an impetus that pushed him into a more visible position.<br />This particular work follows Robert Kennedy during his 1968 presidential campaign; readers travel with the Senator from state to state, immersed in the issues of the day.  The final campaign curtain descends in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968 the night Robert Kennedy was assassinated.  This book stays a step behind that final curtain; instead of revisting the horrendous night of June 5, 1968, Halberstam stops short and appears almost timid to move beyond a certain point.	2001-03-31

To his credit, he treats the late Senator with respect and presents an objective, yet sympathetic portrayal of the man who would be President [in 1968].<br />Newfield takes a middle ground approach in describing the late Senator; he does not whitewash the Senator's shortcomings nor does he put him on a pedastal.  Through Newfield's eyes and voice it is easy to feel as though a full image of Robert Kennedy has been captured as opposed to fleeting ones.  His professional/political career is closely followed; his extreme determination have led many to describe him as ruthless.  Indeed, there appears to be some truth to that statement.  In viewing the then future Attorney General's dogged pursuit, interrogation and prosecution of Teamsters and Mafiosi, it is all too easy to draw that conclusion.  By 1964 and a Senator, the same qualities that had gotten him branded as &quot;ruthless&quot; were viewed by many in a more tolerant light; many supporters viewed him as driven, dogged, determined and very committed to his visions.  Civil Rights and supporting the disenfranchised endeared him to many.  Sadly, this man has been compared to and eclipsed by his brother, the late President Kennedy in many works.  As Attorney General during the [John] Kennedy Adminnistration, Robert Kennedy worked behind the scenes, often  promoting his brother.<br />By 1964 Robert Kennedy had literally come into his own and in finding his voice, became the voice of many.  He was a changing, growing, developing person.  He appeared to keep an open mind and be receptive to knowledge.  The former hawk of the 1950s would become a dove within a decade.  The man who admitted that he never stayed awake nights worrying about minorities became a very strong advocate for minorities.  He was a very complex and interesting person and it is a grave disservice to him to portray him entirely in one type of light.  Newfield is one author who does an excellent job of discussing his subject objectively.

This book raises the issue yet again of a possible conspiracy regarding the 1968 assassination of Robert Kennedy.  The authors, to their credit treat the late Senator with respect; they do a good job of providing information about the Senator's professional and political career.  In reading this particular work one comes away with a sense of the man who was killed in 1968; Robert Kennedy was considered by many to be Everyman's Advocate.  He certainly was a man of strong convictions who appeared to be quite committed to his visions of a &#34;more gentle&#34; world; he was a man with whom many, particularly the disenfranchised could identify with.<br /><br />The issue this work is concentrated on is the identity and motives of the assassin or assassins.  The authors present a very strong and convincing argument of why they feel Sirhan did not act alone nor did he fire the fatal shot; the mysterious &#34;girl in the polka dot dress&#34; allegedly seen with Sirhan, and later allegedly seen fleeing the hotel minutes after the assassination, shouting &#34;We shot him!&#34;  Did such a girl exist?  If so, who was she and what was her involvement?  As for Sirhan, there appears to be little doubt that he was involved to a certain extent in the death of Robert Kennedy; just how great that extent was and who else was involved remain open questions.<br />The biggest open question of all never knowing what Robert Kennedy would have accomplished had he not died.

Acrophobic his entire life, he would, in 1965 climb a previously unscaled mountain in Canada with two professional climbers out of love for his slain brother, the late President.  This single act is very inspirational because he tabled his biggest fear and was able to act out of love.  From all accounts, this man felt displaced among his older, more outgoing siblings.

One can actually feel present during the growth and development of the young Robert Kennedy.<br />Schoor writes in a way that compliments the intelligence of his young audience.  He is clear and straightforward and his use of language is as well.  He includes such information as the late Senator's report cards, his arduous academic career and his political professional career.  The young boy who showed such zeal on the football field was revisited in the man who pursued Teamsters and Mafiosi zealously.  The 4-year-old who flung himself into Nantucket Sound, determined to learn to swim became the man who, 35 years later and a Senator, would climb a previously unscaled mountain named after President Kennedy in Canada.  Acrophobic his entire life, Robert Kennedy would, in March of 1965 confront his worst fear and climb a mountain out of love for his slain brother, the late President Kennedy.<br />I also liked the way Schoor included the late Senator's interactions with his children.  One especially adorable story is one where he and daughter Kerry go sledding together and Kerry tells him not to put snow on his cut head because she didn't want him &quot;using up all the snow!&quot;  The Senator was clearly a man for everyone; in adult life he became the voice of the disenfranchised.<br />Schoor does an excellent job of remaining objective about the Senator; he also treats him with respect.

Kennedy	Books	4	17	18	N	N	An Honorable Man	This beautifully written biography of the late Senator Robert Kennedy does an excellent job of focusing on not only the man's career, but the issues and questions he was confronted with, such as civil rights, poverty and the disenfranchised citizens.<br /><br />Robert Kennedy had a very impressive resume -- father of 11, an undergraduate degree from Harvard, a law degree from University of Virginia, attorney, Attorney General, Senator and lastly, presidential candidate for the 1968 election.<br /><br />This was a man who apparently set high standards for himself throughout his life.  The seventh of 9 children, he fought to prove himself among his siblings.  As a boy, he strove to develop his physical prowess.  One can smile at the young Bobby, then 4 trying to teach himself to swim despite his older brothers' chagrin.  The same small boy who kept jumping in deep water would, 35 years later climb a previously unscaled mountain.  Robert Kennedy, by then a senator suffered from acrophobia his entire life, yet pushed himself to climb that mountain.  In March of 1965 he would table his fear and, with veteran mountain climbers Jim Whittaker and Barry Prather (both of whom had scaled Mt. Everest in 1963) ascend Mt. Kennedy in Canada.  He climbed that mountain out of love for his slain brother, the late President.  This particular event is inspirational; this man faced his biggest fear and acted out of love.<br /><br />As a boy, Robert Kennedy grappled with a mild form of dyslexia.  Although by all accounts he learned to read within normal limits and was certainly an intelligent man, he learned early to combine his intelligence with diligence and very hard work. In adult life he would seek solace in classic literature; by 1964 he was able to quote long passages by authors such as Camus and Aeschylus by heart.

This book shows the cultural blending, the introduction to the western world at large a musical instrument that was, for many years, not well known outside of the middle east.  George, under Shankar's tutelage masters the sitar and the Eastern influence can be heard in many of his later works as well as post-Beatles works.<br />John Lennon, of late 1965 &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; fame is not as entranced with the eastern world and eastern philosophy as his bandmate.  John, from all accounts, keeps an open mind, yet maintains his own established values and beliefs.  His approach to the Eastern experience appears to be that of an intellectual curiosity; he does not appear to embrace it on a personal or philosophical level.  He seems to remain outside, yet looking in with the idea of learning more about what he is witnessing.<br />I think most Beatles fans will appreciate the book.  It does a rather thorough job of covering the Beatles' 1967 trip to India and the influences their trip east had on them for the remainder of their careers together as a band.  It is, in some ways a refreshing peek behind the Eastern curtain into a part of their lives that many other works do not cover as fully.	2001-03-25

Apparently wanting more of a paternal relationship with his oldest son, John tries to make up for this by being a full time father to his second son, Sean (b. 10/9/75).  His love and seemingly dependent relationship with Yoko is also discussed; in reading this work as with many others on John Lennon one gets the feeling that he is rather dependent upon her.<br /><br />Towards the end of his life John learns to sail; this single accomplishment appears to symbolize a step towards independence.  He takes to this new ability immediately and wants to share all he has learned with Sean.<br /><br />Inclusion appears to be the theme of this latter period in his life; he includes Yoko on many of his songs; some of Yoko's works appear on his albums.  On the 1980 &#34;Double Fantasy&#34; collection, John does many self-revealing songs, such as his poignant &#34;Beautiful Boy,&#34; a song he wrote for Sean and &#34;Clean Up Time,&#34; a song about the roles he and Yoko have in running their business.  Yoko's &#34;Beautiful Boys,&#34; which was written for John and Sean is a very peaceful song.  It really is a good song and it is interesting that the title is very similar to the one John did for Sean.<br /><br />This book describes and reveals a very complex man, a very brilliant man, a very tortured man and at core a very private man.  Who knows today what John Lennon would have created had he not died in 1980?  The death of John Lennon on 12/8/80 remains one of the worst days in my life and a day that will be etched in infamy for time immemorial.<br /><br />Imagine John Lennon today.  Imagine John, Sean and Yoko now.  The world will always wonder and Imagine.	2001-03-25

Artist including poet, writer, musician, composer, philosopher, author, revolutionary, father, husband, voice of the world...he was all of these things and more.<br />&quot;Lennon Remembers&quot; is an especially poignant after Lennon's untimely death in 1980.  In reading this book, one gets the feeling that Lennon is baring his soul.  He calls 1965 his &quot;fat Elvis period,&quot; 1965 being the year &quot;Help!&quot; was released.  Lennon calls &quot;Help!&quot; one of his few &quot;real songs,&quot; and admits that the entire &quot;Help!&quot; collection was done while he was under the infuence of marijuana.<br />His confrontations with his fellow bandmates over Yoko Ono is painful; his hurt at their refusal to accept her comes through loud and clear.  Lennon makes no pretense that to him the Beatles were a band, a concept, a period of time...in one memorable passage in the book, he declared he'd be a fisherman if the opportunity had so presented.<br />Intelligence and creativity are a part of John Lennon's discourse; throughout the interview those characteristics are glaringly apparent.  A brilliant, creative man, Lennon makes no apology for his perceptions.  An outspoken, often blunt man, Lennon tells people exactly what he thinks and always has reasons to support his arguments.<br />This book is really a treasure chest.  It is sure to spark one's interest in this gifted, talented man and for veteran fans, it will be a bittersweet experience.  Had John Lennon not died at such an early age, one wonders today how this interview would be conducted.<br />There'll never be another John Lennon.  He raised the bar and set new standards in music and his loss was a very painful one.	2001-03-25

Jamey Cadmus, 17, was part of a pilot project of highly gifted adolescents 5 years earlier and Dr. Delaware was a consultant for that project.<br /><br />Jamey, disoriented and confused, calls Delaware from a private hospital in the California Canyons.  He is kidnapped from his room and it falls to Dr. Delaware to investigate the hospital and Jamey's tangled family tree.<br /><br />Set in 1987, Dr. Delaware makes numerous references to the university project that accepted Jamey in 1982, when the boy was nearly 13.  He uncovers a questionable family history, a web of murders and corrupt developers in the canyons.  Jamey, by now found and incarcerated in the County Jail, tries to, in his own incoherent fashion tell Dr. Delaware what he knows about the series of cases.<br /><br />Robin has a more prominent place in this story.  Although I never cared for her, the one thing that annoyed me in this book was one scene where Delaware greeted her, \\"shushing her with a kiss.\\"  To me, the \\"shushing her with a kiss\\" was simply a way of shutting her up.  That act sounded as if he had no use for her opinions or anything she ever said and smacked of chauvanism.  Notice his shushing her with the standard kiss came on the heels of providing food.  Robin and meals can always be found in the same place and that is really old.<br /><br />Delaware was plainly far more cerebral than Robin ever was and I felt that single act was to underscore his mental superiority to her, not unlike Jamey's mental superiority prior to his breakdowns.  The theme of glass houses is revisited throughout this story.<br /><br />This is truly an outstanding work.  Readers are taken on some very painful, bumpy roads through the seamy, seedy parts of Southern California and encounter some equally seamy, seedy characters.  Bikers, corrupt developers, questionable family ties, persons not involved with the cases -- each appears to be a likely suspect.

Assuming a fake name and identity, Delaware is installed in an apartment Sharavi set up for him.<br /><br />In his new undercover identity, Delaware discovers a Nazi propaganda bookstore, a woman with a twisted mind and an equally twisted agenda, more murders and a final confrontation.<br /><br />Dr. Delaware is also a victim.  He's a victim of bad judgment in relationships.  His tiresome live in lover Robin Castagna is nothing but a sump on everyone's collective time.  Her only purpose when she's not at work as a luthier for rock stars is to be a sex partner and a meal companion for Dr. Delaware.  Their relationship outside the bedroom revolves around food - buying it; going out to eat; meal preparation and eating said meal.  That got old fast.  It was already old in the first book in the series.<br /><br />Although I felt the conclusion was a tad disappointing, it still nevertheless showed the complexities of human nature.  Nothing is ever so cut and dried and satisfactory in real life.<br /><br />I think this is a first rate thriller.	2001-02-14

A whole new season.<br />The four Season sisters, Jillian, Robin (called Birdie), Rosie and Meredith (Merry) are a literary example of how blood really is thicker than water.<br />The sisters, different in temperament and interest were the daughters of a high powered judge and an alcoholic mother.  Jillian, b. 1955 is the rebel, the runaway.  She has an affair at 16 and a child at 17.  She is taken to a Catholic maternity home where she is forced to relinquish the custody of her daughter, b. 5/17/73.<br />Birdie is the high powered doctor.  A driven woman, she takes charge of everything and everybody.  Her 15-year-old daughter, Hannah, a fat, insecure girl resents being ordered around and so does her long suffering husband, Dennis.<br />Rose is the caretaker, the homebody.  She remains in the family home to care for their retarded sister, Merry.  A near drowing episode in a pool at 2 cost Merry the full use of her lungs and mind.  Her sisters carried a guilt complex over her condition.<br />The story opens with Merry's death.  The family attorney, a truly wonderful man makes a video of Merry prior to her death when she states that she wants to find &quot;Spring,&quot; the name she gave Jillian's daughter.  Spring, the one season that none of the Season sisters was born in.  Spring, the time of births and beginnings.<br />The three surviving sisters confront old family demons and with the help of their angel of a lawyer, embark on a quest to find Jillian's daughter.<br />This wonderful story is about forgiveness, acceptance and a whole fresh beginning.  Birdie is able to reconcile with her husband, daughter and sisters; Jillian, the alcoholic model, the rebel is finally more grounded and Rose, the caretaker finds romance.<br />The story is really about births and beginnings, Springs and fresh starts.  I highly recommend it.	2001-02-14

Alex Delaware is called in to determine the psychological aspects of the murder of author Hope Devane.  A veteran of the talk show circuit, brilliant psychologist and scholar, Hope Devane was the survivor of maternal abuse.  Married to a remote, aloof scholar who is not too different in temperament from herself, Devane continues teaching, writing and appearing on talk shows.<br /><br />One of Devane's latest capers may have been the catalyst for her murder.  She created a kangaroo court in a local college ostensibly to protect women from date rape.  She badgers the girls to come forward and one stupid girl named Cindy protects and declares love for her attacker, one Ken Storm, Jr. He threatens her, pushes her out of his car and forces her to fend for herself one night.  Even after Storm becomes involved with prostitutes and other violent behavior, silly Cindy defends him. The other women involved in the kangaroo court hearings demand that the men in question be prosecuted.  In reading the transcrips of the hearings, one can't help noticing how Devane and her panel of \\"kangaroos\\" press the women to press charges and show an antagonism towards men in general.<br /><br />Delaware probes deeper, and, like a carbuncle, discovers many festering layers beneath the surface.  He uncovers an abortion clinic, shady family connections, murder, extortion and theft.  Each mystery is a segue to the next and the multiple conclusions are always several steps ahead of the reader.<br /><br />Sadly, Dr. Delaware is still hooked up with his tiresome live in lover Robin Castagna.  I never liked Robin and her only purpose when she's not crafting instruments for the rock stars is to serve as a bedmate and a meal companion for Dr. Delaware.  I am beyond tired of how the bulk of their time is spent on meals or food prep.<br /><br />I thought this was an excellent thriller.	2001-02-14

Her mother died when she was a child, her brother became a drug addict and her father, a disgusting, vile recluse was an aging 1960s flower child.  He is singularly foul in appearance, hygiene (he is incontinent and wheelchair bound) and speech.  He lives a reclusive life with a private nurse, bitter about having to provide skilled nursing care.<br /><br />A serial killer invades Lucy's life.  A disgusting creature, not too different in temperament from her father, the killer mutilates people and befouls their bodies.  Lucy had to sit on the jury of this case.<br /><br />She has recurring nightmares about these issues and Dr. Delaware is called in to investigate.  He unearths a series of murder, extortion and mistaken identity cases.  Each mystery is a segue to the next and in this book, the conclusion is plausible and satisfactory.  Another positive note is that Robin, Delaware's live in girlfriend has more or less receded to the background.  I never cared for Robin and never felt she contributed to any of the Alex Delaware stories in any meaningful way.  Her main contribution is to serve as a bedmate and provide food.  Passages about her almost ALWAYS involve food in some form and that got quite old from the start, from the first book in the series.	2001-02-14

His twisted psychopathology is revealed throughout the book; memories and background of this predator or interspersed throughout the story.<br />Investigator (Pakad) Daniel Sharavi is introduced. This is the one book that is NOT about Alex Delaware. Sharavi, like Delaware possesses a street savvy and a keen insight into human nature. Kellerman maintains his readers' interest in Sharavi; one is never quite sure of Sharavi's next move.<br />The descriptions given of Jerusalem's weather, flora, fauna and cities are vivid and realistic. Readers can see alongside of the author and those familiar with the terrain the scenes being described. One can also feel the simmering tension, the cauldron of tension that is turned up high. One can feel the ancient history, the political unrest, the beautiful ancient traditions of this historic city. The contrast between the ancient traditions and the current values is effectively drawn.<br />I did not detect any note of racism in this story. The fictitious characters were given their own racial views, but again, this was part of the development of the characters in response to the times they were living in and the issues they were confronting.<br />Sharavi is an interesting blend of the Western World's white hatted cowboy and a man with his own agenda. He clearly has a mean streak. In one chilling scene, Sharavi verbally baits and slaps a prisoner. The prisoner, Anwar, born with malformed genitals was arrested after he beat and nearly strangled a prostitute who laughed at his misfortune. When Sharavi questions him in jail, he tells him his \\"manhood\\" is \\"worthless\\" and slaps him when he tries to retaliate. That was disturbing.<br />Anwar's congenital deformity is a parallel to the killer's deformed psyche. Sharavi makes for a very interesting character and I was delighted to see him make a guest appearance in \\"Survival of the Fittest.\\"<br />This is one of Kellerman's best works.ery interesting character and I was delighted to see him make a guest appearance in \\"Survival of the Fittest.\\" <br />This is one of Kellerman's best works.	2001-02-14

Bright and highly resourceful, Melissa calls Dr. Delaware describing her seemingly irrational fears.  Her biggest fear is that of her mother's safety.  In 1969, Melissa's mother, then a young model was attacked by a man who threw acid in her face, thus disfiguring her.<br /><br />Melissa comes from an extremely wealthy background and is often brought to her appointments by a chauffer who drives a 1962 Cadillac. She becomes quite interested in Dr. Delaware's beautiful Dodge Dart which he had during his undergraduate years.  To her, the beautiful Chrysler was a novelty.<br /><br />Dr. Delaware once again comes into contact with Melissa, by now grown and entering college.  He works with her in uncovering the identity and motives of not only her mother's attacker, but those involved with the man.<br /><br />On the plus side as well, Robin has moved in with another man.  I never liked Robin and  make no bones about it.  Alex Delaware has continued his romance with Linda Overstreet, a smarter and much more appealing character than Robin ever was.  Each time Dr. Delaware and Robin split up, one hopes it will be the last time.  Robin is an inane drag and her purpose when she's back with Dr. Delaware is to serve as a sex partner and a table companion.  She does not match him intellectually.  Darn shame he went back to her as she appears to be nothing but a millstone.<br /><br />One thing I really didn't like was the patronizing attitude Dr. Delaware takes with his tiresome lover Robin.  I didn't like it when he \\"placed a finger over her lips\\" and then \\"kissed her cheek.\\"  In  [[ASIN:034552148X Over the Edge: An Alex Delaware Novel (Alex Delaware Novels)]],  he \\"shushes her with a kiss\\" instead of listening to her.  In this book Delaware in effect does the same thing here.  I didn't like that at all.<br /><br />This is truly a taut, gripping story.  The characters are richly drawn so that one gets a pyschological as well as a physical impression of them.  The mysteries neatly overlap; there is no extraneous material here.  To make a good thing even better, Robin is more or less ushered out the door.  I hoped that she would be because I never really cared for her in the first place.  Her main role in this book was to leave readers with the question of whether or not she and Dr. Delaware reconnect.characters are richly drawn so that one gets a pyschological as well as a physical impression of them.

He accepts an invitation to a party and reconnects with a former flame, one Sharon Ransom.<br /><br />Sharon has a backlog of mystery in her life.  Her story is by far and away the best telling of the cliche good/evil twin theme.  It did provide a refreshing approach to the tired good/evil twin routine. To add even more mystery into the pot, Sharon is one third of a set of triplets!<br /><br />It is up to Dr. Delaware to locate the other two sisters, one of whom was severely developmentally delayed and institutionalized. In tracking down Sharon's elusive past, he uncovers a Howard Hughes-like figure, a black market baby ring, scandals galore including murder.  This book is layers of mysteries -- for each mystery discovered, several more lurk beneath the surface.<br /><br />Also on the plus side, Dr. Delaware's tiresome sex partner and meal companion Robin is a minor character in this story.  I never liked Robin and I am beyond tired of how her time spent with Dr. Delaware revolves around meals with an occasional tawdry sex scene thrown in.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, although I did feel the story was implausible.  I thought the Howard Hughes like character, the conclusion and the early lives of Sharon and her sisters was unbelievable.  The conclusion was rather unsatisfactory.  One was never really quite sure who the guilty party in the final confrontation really was.	2001-02-11

The attacker's father enlists the aid of the duo, requesting that they do a psychological portrait of his slain daughter.  As the men delve deeper into their work, they uncover a Pandora's box of ugly secrets and are left with the question of who was REALLY a victim the day of the shooting?<br /><br />On the plus side, Alex develops a new romantic partner, principal Linda Overstreet.  A tough Southwesterner, she provides more class than Robin ever did.  She also appears to be much brighter.  She has an interesting psychological background including \\"cops and music.\\" It would have been wonderful if Robin had been ushered out the door for good.<br /><br />As usual, if there is food, kisses or wine you can find Robin.

An overmedicated child, Melody lives with her single mother in a run down apartment with a ban on children.  Fearful of being evicted, Melody's mother feeds her tranquilizers and reduces Melody into a druggy stupor.<br /><br />Dr. Delaware is called in to consult with Melody and take the first step in cracking a Chinese box of mysteries.  His detective trail takes him from Southern California to Washington State.  He and Sturgis discover a child-porn ring, murder, deception and extortion.  The end is a tad anticlimatic because all the loose ends are neatly tied up with a perfect bow.<br /><br />I didn't care for Dr. Delaware's live in girlfriend, Robin.  An accomplished luthier, Robin is described as fiercely independent.  Her role is primarily as a meal mate and bed warmer for Dr. Delaware.  One gets tired of all the time they spend on food.  That's the pin on which their relationship revolves when they're not sleeping together.  She does some pretty inane things, though.  I didn't like it when she wore a picture of Lassie around her neck to atone for offending Alex.  I thought that was stupid.  I never really cared for Robin in the first place.<br /><br />Note the names:  Handler, for the psychiatrist.

An academic and social leader, Ann demonstrated an empathy for the disenfranchised at an early age.  Born in 1952, Ann became caught up in the social awareness theme of the 1960s and early-to mid 1970s.<br />Trouble became apparent in her life in 1975, the year she was supposed to graduate from Brown University.  An incomplete thesis, a break up with a boyfriend, a relationship with an older man and increasingly bizarre and erratic behavior were the problems Ann exhibited.  She hid in her closet and slashed her arms.  Powerless, Ann's mother could no more force her into a hospital admission than her psychiatrist or the admitting physician.  Ann finally agrees to hospitalization and received inpatient treatment at Austen Riggs Hospital in Connecticut.  Patients are given almost complete freedom of mobility and decision making and it is there Ann deteriorates, becoming an incoherent refugee of yard sales and the detritus of other people's lives.  After spending 1975-76 there, Ann's mother has her admitted at the hospital in Yale.<br />Ann's life spirals downward as does her mother's.  Ann's parents divorce after four children and many years of marriage.  Ann, too, splits &quot;off&quot; and her life becomes a litany of hospitals, delusions and a nomadic existence on the streets.  She contracts AIDS and sadly becomes a casualty of this illness at age 34.<br />One especially moving part of the book was when the author called an AIDS hotline and spoke to a very caring, empathetic man.  He then referred her to a doctor specialized in treating persons with AIDS who was a very empathetic man.  It is this doctor and this unknown phone volunteer who offer a touch of humanity in the AIDS community and beyond.<br />Her survivors include her parents, a gentle stepfather, her two brothers and sister and several step siblings, an extended loving family.  Her nephew coined the term about the moon being broken.  It is an apt metaphor for the tragic last decade of Ann Craig's life.or the tragic last decade of Ann Craig's life.	2001-01-28

Her mother fights like a soldier for her and refuses to institutionalize her and protects her from gawking strangers, intrusive strangers who misinterpret her muteness as evidence of abuse.  One intrusive little boy and his ill mannered mother make trouble for Rainey and Sasha when Sasha ignores the boy's entreaty to play on the see saw with him.  The boy's mother meddles, makes inappropriate comments and later reports Rainey to Child Protective Services.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, the villians stand out in stark contrast to the other characters.  In the old west, they'd have a show down in Dodge City and wear hats that identify their good or bad guy status.<br /><br />Hope comes in the form of a neighbor named Emma.  A lady from Scotland, she recognizes Sasha's intermittent speech as Gaelic.  She points Rainey, Sasha's mother in the direction of a Gaelic professor with the idea of reaching Sascha.<br /><br />Rainey heeds her gentle advice and the rest of the book is filled with misty, starry skies, Gaelic flavored history and the identity Sascha has claimed as hers.  A cliche romance ensues, and Sasha is on the road to recovery.  She travels a long and bumpy road from California to Scotland, where she reconnects with the soul of a dead Scottish princess.<br /><br />Replete with Celtic legends, language and flavor, this book is much more interesting than most romance novels.

NURTURE CONTROVERSY	Margaret and Arthur Crawfield are devastated to learn from a doctor that their terminally ill son, Peter is not really their child.  Blood tests have proven that Peter cannot possibly be related to the Crawfords.  Since Peter was born in a small clinic, they set upon a quest to find the one other baby boy who was born at the clinic the day Peter was born.<br />Their search leads them to Laura and Bud Rice, an affluent couple with two sons.  The younger son, Tim is chronically ill like Peter.  Tom, the older of the two is involved in a clandestine chapter of the KKK with Bud.  Tom's girlfriend, Robbie is an ardent Nazi and believes &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; to be gospel instead of hateful propaganda.  She and Tom share bigotry and she declares that she &quot;went political&quot; at an early age; being &quot;political&quot; is her euphemism for espousing bigotry and hate.<br />The two families meet, Tom's confusion reaches a head...the Crawfields are Jewish!  Tom has to accept his natural heritage and yet, he isn't sure about the bigotry that Bud taught him.  This story emphasizes the nature v. nurture controversy.  Bigotry is not a congenital condition.  It is a learned condition.  As for Tom, which side does he choose?  His natural Jewish heritage or the learned bigotry?  And Robbie?  Where does she fit into this?  The plot does thicken and the story is compelling.	2001-01-06

The Michaelangelo of Mysteries has created yet another masterpiece.  The trademark of Kellerman's work is the psychological profile of each of the characters.  He also provides in-depth descriptions so that his readers have a full sense of what his characters look like and what makes them tick.<br /><br />Dr. Eldon Mate is known as \\"Dr. Death\\" because of his work in euthanasia.  He calls his clients \\"travelers\\" and prepares them for their final trip.  At the opening of the story, Dr. Mate is found mutilated and bound to his own apparatus, thus reinforcing the old adage of whoever lives by the sword, dies by the sword.  It is up to Dr. Delaware and Detective Sturgis to crack this case.<br /><br />Their list of suspects is quite long and any or all of them quite likely candidates.  One real estate developer, seemingly devastated over the loss of his wife is a suspect.  His children possibilities.  The decedent's widow and son more possible suspects.  An FBI agent with an agenda of his own and several \\"Angel of Mercy\\" killers in hospitals are being considered.<br /><br />Dr. Delaware is still saddled with his tiresome lover Robin Castagna.  I admit that I never liked her and found her a boring albatross around Dr. Delaware's neck.  Her main purpose is to serve as his bedmate and table companion.  The majority of their time together revolves around meals.  Occasionally her career as a luthier is mentioned, but it does seem they spend an inordinate amount of their time together fixated on some meal.<br /><br />Kellerman takes his readers through some rough terrain to crack this case.  He throws out some interesting symbols. For example, the name \\"Mate,\\" can either mean \\"to reproduce,\\" or it can be interpreted as the Spanish imperative form of \\"matar,\\" to kill.  A twisted artist paints a picture of Mate hooked up to his own machine with a second Mate figure preparing the traveler.  Mate as traveler and travel agent -- this lends further support to the double edged sword of the name \\"Mate.\\"  Mate's widow is Latina, so it is possible Mate picked up some Spanish, including the Spanish meaning of the name \\"Mate.\\"<br /><br />This is a first rate mystery and thriller.

She walks hunched over, she yells at her friends to &quot;just stop it&quot; when they were innocently dancing at a party; she whispers her answer in the teacher's ear instead of speaking before the class.  Her verbalizations become increasingly bizarre and her behavior more erratic and unstable.  She tells her parents and 12-year-old sister that she is going crazy, but they brush her concerns aside.  In one memorable blunder on her parents' part, they send her to a nursing home in Florida during winter break with the idea of sweeping her bizarre behavior under the rug without &quot;the neighbors finding out.&quot;<br />Several girls who know Lisa band together to form what they call &quot;group therapy.&quot;  They sit and talk to her and try to uncover the root of her illness.  They urge her to tell them what is on her mind.  She makes light of their efforts, but does form an attachment to a girl named Elizabeth.  It turns out Elizabeth is a survivor of a mental breakdown and her father enlists the aid of her former psychiatrist to treat Lisa.<br />The critical point of this book is when Lisa gets up from the couch and walks through a sliding glass door.  Alarmed, the girls notify her parents who by then have to confront the truth.<br />The narrator of this story is a 14-year-old who is delighted to have an &quot;in&quot; place with these older girls.  For the most part she was appealing, but I did get annoyed with her &quot;wish for a cigarette&quot; so she &quot;could do something with her hands.&quot;  I didn't like that part.  I also didn't like the silly way she mentally mouthed, &quot;Paul [Newman]!  I'm back!&quot; as if the actor would have even known.  She has a silly little schoolgirl crush on Elizabeth's former doctor, which did not contribute at all to this story.<br />It is also interesting to note that the school the girls attended did not get more involved.  It does seem very unrealistic that school personnel did not notify Lisa's parents about the girl's erratic behavior and strange utterances.his story.<br />It is also interesting to note that the school the girls attended did not get more involved.

His affect and linguistic development was way below age level and Smith responded to him as if he were a much younger child.<br />Over time, Alex began confiding in his foster parents about his horrific life with his natural family.  A group of cultists, they subjected the boy to ritual abuse and holidays for him took on sinister overtones based on his early life experiences.  Suffering from DID/MPD, Alex begins to inch his way towards recovery.  He does have some serious set backs and spends time in a hospital.  His psychiatrist, Dr. Steven Kingsbury appears to be a very bright and progressive man with insights on treating Alex's disorder.

Marcia's mother beats her, starves her and on one memorable occasion, knocks the 9-year-old's front teeth out with a hammer.  She threatens to give Marcia away to &quot;the gypsies;&quot; she enlists the aid of her sons to further demean their sister.<br />Marcia masters the art of disassociating; she fragments herself into several distinct personalities to cope with her mother's special brand of torture.  These personalities are different ages and some are even male.  One personality, called Camille is blind.  They each have specific roles to play and specific duties to fulfill.<br />Like many persons suffering from DID/MPD, Marcia is artistically gifted.  She makes an impressive showing despite her &quot;loss of time&quot; in school and even functions as a wife and mother.<br />As her behavior becomes more erratic and time more elusive and questionable, Marcia finally seeks help.  It is through her hard work and her therapist's dedication that she finally conquers the demons of her childhood.  She is somewhat infantile during therapy; she envisions herself approximately half the doctor's height and turns him into a father figure.  She becomes quite dependent upon her doctor and it is to his credit that he keeps the sessions on a professional level.  One can speculate that Marcia is going through a symbolic &quot;rebirth,&quot; or &quot;renaissance&quot; in treatment because her own real life was so horrendous.<br />This is a book about hope, loving and healing.

Elizabeth Katherine Meyer survived extreme physical, mental and sexual abuse in childhood.  Her father was an especially cruel man who would often taunt Katherine and set her up to be ridiculed by others.<br />At an early age, Katherine perfected her &quot;retreat&quot; skills.  She had somehow created seven alters to go to bat for her at various points in her life.  They were different ages and two of the alters were male.  One of her male alters, &quot;Michael,&quot; was described as an ISH, or Inner Self Helper.  It is Michael who ironically helps Katherine to bring her other alters together. Liz and Me-Liz were twin alters who coped with pain.  The Liz personality was the weakest, so Katherine's other alters conducted a &quot;meeting&quot; and banished her.<br />It is through a painful divorce, losing custody of her twin daughters and her 1965 Dodge Coronet that Katherine finally confronts her condition.  Her soldierly efforts with her therapist prove fruitful and ironically, it is Michael (perhaps he was named after the Archangel, known for his protection against evil and a brave warrior) who really brings the healing process together.<br />The book's title, &quot;Katherine, It's Time&quot; has been shortened to &quot;Kit,&quot; the name the author currently uses.	2001-01-04

A brilliant, highly accomplished man, Dr. West takes his readers on a harrowing journey through maternal abuse and neglect.  Dr. West describes the denial other family members had in re his mentally ill mother and maternal grandmother; hostility and secrecy appear to be the common themes throughout his immediate family.<br /><br />His wife, Rikki, is truly an exceptional woman.  She does not succumb to the temptation of an available affair when Dr. West's condition places a strain on their marriage; she really gives Dr. West ballast and a loving voice of reason throughout the book.<br /><br />Their son, Kyle is delightful.  A bright, expressive boy, Kyle relates in detail the challenges and blessings of having a parent with this unusual condition.  He is the one who keeps a loving eye on both of his parents; it is Kyle who asks Rikki about her \\"boyfriend\\" during the period she was contemplating having an affair.  It is Kyle who, in effect, helps reel Rikki and Dr. Cameron West in and it is he who has connected them.<br /><br />In February of 1998, Dr. West and his family appeared on the Oprah! show and listening to each family member speak of their own personal involvement with multiple dissociative disorder was quite an eye opener.  I was quite impressed.<br /><br />I like the way Dr. West gives the names, ages and descriptions of each of his individual and very distinct personalities.  That helps the reader keep track of them and how they play an important role in his life.  Dr. West is like a diamond; he is multifaceted and radiates light and beauty in the face of daunting challenges.  This book is like a diamond.  It is a highly valuable voice of insight into a very curious condition.<br />This is a book I would highly recommend.	2001-01-04

He was inordinately facinated with penmanship, which ties into Rhoda's surname - Penmark. The object of Rhoda's unerring interest is a medal for improvement in penmanship - again, a tie-in to March's interest.<br /><br />Racism was flourishing in the 1950s. At that time black characters were generally relegated to crooks and stereotypes and Leroy the custodian is no exception. Although the actors who played Leroy in the tepid 1956 movie and abominable, barely watchable 1985 remake were Caucasian, the speech patterns; description of his home and the names of the Jessups, \\"Thelma and Leroy\\" suggest that the character was intended to be black.<br /><br />Rhoda Penmark, the protagonist of this dark tale which is set in 1952, is an 8-year-old murderer. She has quite a resume -- pupil with perfect attendance, perfect deportment, top grades and -- murder. Her hangman noose braids lend a note of the sinister to her - she is a very dark character, a malign presence among the unwary.<br /><br />Rhoda's mother Christine knows that something is amiss with this child. Rhoda appears to have a limited range of emotions and is much more interested in securing honors and possessions than she is in people. Her teachers, the redoubtable Fern Sisters of the elite, exclusive private school they run notice Rhoda's alienation from her peers and singleness of purpose. Elderly women appear to love Rhoda; her neighbor, Mrs. Breedlove and a benign \\"Miss Jessie,\\" another resident of Rhoda's apartment building are charmed and beguiled by her.<br /><br />Leroy, the gardener admits to \\"being in love\\" with Rhoda because she stands up to him when he bullies her and the children in her building. His persistent pestering of the child is described as a \\"perverse and frightening courtship\\" and his wife begs him to stop bothering Rhoda and \\"those rich people's children.\\" Leroy's pursuit of Rhoda and her continual covering up for him seems implausible. He accuses her of killing her classmate on her school picnic because the classmate won the coveted penmanship improvement medal. Rhoda, of course denies this, even though she did in fact kill the boy. Leroy hounds her mercilessly and even gives her a box with a dead rat inside as a gift. Why Rhoda didn't tell on him and gain some sympathy for herself and throw off any suspicion about her classmate's death and the firing of Leroy never made any sense to me. She could have blown the whistle on Leroy, painted herself in a sympathetic light and deflected further suspicion.<br /><br />Christine's suspicion mounted every day after Rhoda's school had their annual last day picnic. Rhoda's classmate Claude Daigle was drowned, his hands and face bearing odd, crescent shaped scars. These scars were made from the cleats on Rhoda's shoes. She forced Claude off the dock, beat him with the shoes until he gave her his medal. Taking his life was secondary to her; she wanted it known once Christine confronted her with killing Claude that she did NOT TAKE the medal.<br /><br />Christine uncovers other deaths -- at 7, Rhoda killed an elderly neighbor for her glass ball with opal flakes. At 8, she kills her classmate Claude and later, Leroy.<br /><br />The death of Leroy leads to a painful, unsatisfactory ending. The movie and play were cop outs with a weak, sanitized ending to pacify the audience of the 1950s. The execrable 1985 remake is barely watchable and is almost a parody of the book. The book is a dark, macabre tale of a sociopathic child whose killing streak is blamed on a homicidal maternal grandmother. Although that premise seems rather shaky, it does lend itself to question.frightening courtship\\" and his wife begs him to stop bothering Rhoda and \\"those rich people's children.\\" Leroy's pursuit of Rhoda and her continual covering up for him seems implausible.

Angelo intensely detests his maternal Aunt Alice, who recognizes his social disorder from the start.<br /><br />Although this is not a diagnostic book, I did feel the description of a psychopath was quite poor. The time sequence is off. For example, the book opens in 1957 with the then 4-year-old Angelo and closes with an epilogue set at the end of 1964. In Chapter 5, the boy's Aunt Alice tells Mark, the boy's father about a pupil named Kennie she had whose father killed his wife with their son as a witness two years prior to her teaching him. Since that was in 1959, how could the father have killed his wife two years prior and then been executed prior to killing her? In Chapter 10, Kennie's father was reported to have killed his wife on June 5, 1959 and was executed on January 5, 1959. How can his death predate his crime and conviction?<br /><br />At the opening of the story, Angelo, then 4, expresses deep rage at Alice and this rage is manifested in bouts of wetting accidents. He then attacks Alice by smashing the contents of her purse; he destroyed her sunglasses; used her handerkerchief as toilet paper and flushed some of her money down the toilet. His loving, but foolish mother Katherine condones his actions by insisting it was just a childish prank. Mark, however, punishes Angelo.<br /><br />Over the years, Angelo's cruelties become more subtle and clever. At 6, he discreetly kills a pet dog (which Alice discovers when she visits her sister's family at their summer place in 1959); he frightens away the birds and woodland creatures, viewing them as \\"weak enemies,\\" and he nearly kills Alice by pushing her over a cliff. Luckily, she is saved, but does not testify against her nephew.<br /><br />Alice has a crush on Mark which comes as no surprise. (Can't you just hear 1959's \\"Theme from a Summer Place\\" playing in the background?) During that summer of 1959, she tells him about a pupil she has who is Angelo's overdrawn literary opposite. Kennie, the orphan whom Alice endorses has been placed with a couple after the boy's father killed his wife in 1959. Alice tells Mark that the boy became an orphan two years earlier, which meant Kennie would have been orphaned in 1957.<br /><br />Angelo is described as physically large for his age, stunning in appearance and mentally gifted. Despite his natural endowments, he is rather primitive and immature, still given to uncontrollable outbursts of rage and physical attacks on Katherine.<br /><br />At 10, Angelo has perfected the dark art of subtle cruelty. He nearly poisons a housekeeper because she senses he is not the \\"Angel Saint\\" (as Katherine calls him) after all; he hounds a classmate out of his prestigious prep school (yes, Kennie which should surprise no one); he pit people against one another and broke a teacher's arm \\"accidentally\\" during a school football game. He uses charm to get out of every difficulty and has all, but these few, whom he has hurt fooled.<br /><br />Angelo thinks of how easy it is to fool \\"weak women,\\" and the thought of being sent to a military boarding school per Mark's suggestion is abhorrent to him because \\"strong men\\" would make him toe the line. Overindulged and fed with a sense of entitlement, Angelo is incredibly immature. He does not appear to be sophisticated and relies on childish guile to charm people.<br /><br />When Katherine becomes pregnant with a second child in 1963, she senses that it is wise not to tell Angelo. He pesters her for information about why she is going to the doctor and once he discovers her secret, kills the unborn child, Katherine and later perishes. Even his death is bizarre -- he trips down a flight of steps only to land on his head on the marble floor below. Katherine later dies in the hospital, confiding to Alice that she really knew what an evil son she truly had.<br /><br />The cliches that bothered me was the boy's name, Angelo Saint. This is obviously a contradiction of his character, which was truly evil. As bad as the misaligned time sequence was, I also disliked the obvious coincidences, like Angelo and Kennie (Alice's protege) ending up as classmates and Mark later meeting Kennie with Alice.<br /><br />There were some unrealistic parts to the story, such as Angelo being able to gain access to Kennie's records and copy them for the class to read. I also didn't buy an employment agency for maid service giving Mark the address of the family where one of his former maids was working. What about confidentiality? That doesn't sound ethical or realistic. I also didn't like it when the maid lied to Mark about checking on a roast. It was a very weak and transparent dodge.<br /><br />The time misalignment was bad enough, but I really didn't like the sexist comments, e.g. \\"he screamed like a girl.\\" I also didn't like the way Katherine's second pregnancy was criticized because of her age. Alice was a little too straitlaced and overdrawn and, at times, seemed insincere. She mouthed inanities, such as \\"Mark's clever hand.\\" Since when is a hand clever? I also didn't like it when she said \\"don't laugh\\" after she complained to Mark about inadequacies in the education field. Mark was NOT laughing - he was listening to her and taking her diatribe seriously!<br /><br />Katherine was overly effusive in her expressions and was singularly foolish. Mark and his friend, Dr. Whiteside were the only real sympathetic characters save for Angelo's victims.<br /><br />This book seemed quite sexist even by 1965 standards.she really knew what an evil son she truly had.

I also didn't buy an employment agency for maid service giving Mark the address of the family where one of his former maids was working. What about confidentiality? That doesn't sound ethical or realistic. I also didn't like it when the maid lied to Mark about checking on a roast. It was a very weak and transparent dodge.     The time misalignment was bad enough, but I really didn't like the sexist comments, e.g. \\"he screamed like a girl.\\" I also didn't like the way Katherine's second pregnancy was criticized because of her age. Alice was a little too straitlaced and overdrawn and, at times, seemed insincere. She mouthed inanities, such as \\"Mark's clever hand.\\" Since when is a hand clever? I also didn't like it when she said \\"don't laugh\\" after she complained to Mark about inadequacies in the education field. Mark was NOT laughing - he was listening to her and taking her diatribe seriously!     Katherine was overly effusive in her expressions and was singularly foolish. Mark and his friend, Dr. Whiteside were the only real sympathetic characters save for Angelo's victims.     This book seemed quite sexist even by 1965 standards.	2000-12-23

She is poised on one leg and he feels an instant bond.  He has found another one-legged toy and believes this to be love.<br />The steadfast tin soldier has a series of mishaps.  He falls off the window sill into a stream.  From there, he is transported to a rat infested sewer.

A gust of wind lifts the paper ballerina up and she flutters into the fire place, winding up a charred heap of ashes.  Devastated, the tin soldier joins her.  The remaining metal that was once the tin soldier is a charred piece of heart shaped metal.<br />I still think this is a very sad story.

I loved it because it was an excellent introduction to Senator Robert Kennedy.<br />The book is beautifully illustrated with very realistic looking drawings.  The drawings of the Senator as a boy makes him a child other children can relate to.  One can laugh with the little Bobby, watching his friend making a crash landing with a homemade parachute.  (Luckily HE didn't try this stunt!  Good thing he used a stunt man for this one)!  One can cheer for the grown man, the Senator who reached the top of a Canadian mountain in 1965 after a lifetime of acrophobia.<br />The last part, covering the Senator's assassination is handled delicately, since the book targets a young audience.  I enjoyed it as a child.  It is not a comprehensive book, but a good introduction to Robert Kennedy is really all it is.  It's just a nice little starter book.	2000-12-17

Students are being expelled for being just &quot;a little bit behind,&quot; one child who has an auditory disorder is shown the door while a third is being expelled ostensibly for not paying attention.  It turns out this child is the daughter of a high powered Manhattan judge who will stop at nothing to see that justice is done.  Charging into the headmaster's office, the judge demands answers for why her Rachel is being expelled.  In demagogic fashion, the headmaster says he is doing an &quot;ethnic sweep&quot; and names several other students he feels aren't up to par.

I actually laughed so hard it hurt!<br />Beth-Ellen, Harriet's shy and retiring friend is the perfect foil to the outspoken, brash, wonderfully assertive Harriet of Harriet the Spy fame.  Both girls have summer homes in Water Mill, Long Island, their families' retreat from Manhattan when school gets out.  Beth-Ellen lives with her kindly grandmother, who has some rather neanderthal ideas about imparting information concerning puberty, but who is a nice sort after all.<br />Harriet has not put down her pen and notebook.  Seems that somebody else has taken up writing that summer.  Quotes from the Bible and parodies of Scripture are seen throughout the Water Mill community.  Naturally suspicion turns to a summer girl named Jessie who aspires to be a preacher when she grows up.  Chock full of Biblical knowledge, Jessie has a morbidly obese mother and twin brother and a cute preschool sister.  There is no mention of a father.<br />Beth-Ellen, on the other hand becomes reacquainted with her mother.  Seems that Beth-Ellen's mother was a society lady, preferring parties and travel to raising a child.  Beth-Ellen's natural father left some years earlier.<br />The reunion is a bust.  Beth-Ellen's mother, Zeeney, is just as flighty and superficial as ever.  Her stepfather just says &quot;hup&quot; and loves martinis.  They try to make Beth-Ellen over, straightening her hair and choosing her clothes and insisting that she leave her grandmother and come with them.  Beth-Ellen refuses, wins her case and Harriet cracks THE case -- the identity of the Secret Writer!<br />This book is a riot!	2000-12-14

She described her life as a young wife during the Depression Years when money was hard to come by.  She saw a beautiful, very ornate menorah in a shop window and wanted it.  Unable to afford it, her husband went into his shop, and, using assorted scraps around the place built a makeshift menorah.  That way, they could celebrate the ancient, wonderful traditions together with something he had made.<br />Rachel is understandably moved by the menorah's history.  She decides it is beautiful because it was made by love.  When her mother comes to pick her up and comments on how ugly she thinks the menorah is, Rachel tells her it is NOT ugly, it is beautiful!<br />Rachel was right.

Bright and dyslexic, she finds reading time the biggest hardship in her life.  She has to contend with the cruelty of her peers and her constant doubts about her own intelligence and place among her family of avid readers.<br />The year Tricia was in 5th grade, she moved out of state.  Eager to make a fresh start, Tricia entered Mr. Falker's classroom.  Once again, she was made the object of cruel jeering among her peers because she was not able to read.  One especially cruel boy named Eric seemed to derive sadistic pleasure in taunting her.<br />Tricia's teacher, Mr. Falker decided to take the bull by the horns once and for all.  He declared his classroom had a zero tolerance for taunting; he encouraged Tricia in every effort she made.<br />Tricia soldiered on, but still had trouble reading.  Matters reached a critical head when Mr. Falker found her crying in a broom closet in an attempt to hide from Eric.<br />From that day on, he worked with Tricia and a reading teacher.  Mr. Falker and the reading teacher were positive, gentle and very encouraging.  They cheered every progress, regardless. Between the two professionals, Tricia took off like the proverbial jet plane.  Basking in the glow of her success, she would, as she said, in later years embark upon a writing career.<br />This book will make you sad, mad, cheer and maybe even cry.  It is a sterling example of a success story and is a salute to every kind teacher who really made a positive difference in somebody's life.

It is the story of the prophet Elijah, nephew of St. Peter and friend of Jesus.<br />The child Elijah and his widowed mother work hard to make ends meet.  Elijah sells the bread his mother bakes and fishes for their supper.  His cousin, whose father is St. Peter, talks about the Teacher/Rabbi, the man named Jesus who talks of love and fairness.  Elijah is excited and begs his mother to let him hear the Rabbi Jesus speaks.  Her usual response is that if Jesus is who He claims to be, no gift is too small.  Before she lets him join his cousin to hear Jesus, he has to clean their home and help her with the household chores.  Once he finishes his chores, he joins his cousin, his Uncle Peter and others to hear Jesus.<br />Saddened by the dearth of food and shelter to offer Jesus, Elijah asks his mother what they can give this gentle teacher.  She tells him yet again that no gift is small to Jesus.  Pondering this, Elijah offers Jesus the basket of fish he caught that morning.  Jesus thanks him and says how lucky it was the boy caught them because the crowd had grown in number and the people were hungry.  They just might like some fish.<br />Reaching into the basket, Jesus manages to feed the crowd a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fish.  Elijah, Peter, and the others watch with amazed delight.  That night, Elijah talks about Jesus in great length to his cousin and mother.  Elijah's mother smiled and imparted her message yet again that no gift is small to Jesus.<br />This is such an outstanding book with first rate illustrations.  It is an excellent teaching tool and a wonderful reminder of the message Elijah's mother imparted.  Each time one gives to God, that gift is welcomed wholeheartedly and is never small to Him.<br />I really love this book.	2000-12-04

It is to Max Lucado and his daughters' credit that the story does not end with the predictable healing of Joshua's game leg.

As Greg watches Michael, 4 years his senior, descend further into madness and the negative impact Michael has on the rest of the family, he sees the desperation in Michael's illness.  He pinpoints Michael's illness as classic -- adolescent onset psychosis at age 14, heavy drug abuse and violent behavior.  As Greg chronicles Michael's deteriorating health and each account of the latter's behavior becomes even more frightening and bizarre, one cannot help but feel pulled into Greg's world.  As an observer witnessing the horrors mental illness can wreak on a family, one fights Michael's mental demons with Greg; one hears the anguish, shame and desperation in Greg's harrowing accounts. It is devastating to learn of Michael's ballooning into obesity after years of lean, physical health; it is horrifying to learn of Michael's life on skid row, living a life of violence, pyschosis and danger on the street.  Michael's illness culminates in a tragic act of violence that leaves lifetime repercussions.<br />Greg Bottoms has written a first rate account of living with a mentally ill sibling.  In this book, his voice serves as not only as an advocate for the mentally ill, but for the families of people who suffer from mental illness.	2000-12-02

Blind and deaf since infancy, Helen had no ready access to communication.  Enter Annie, a Perkins School for the Blind alum who strives to teach her rebellious young charge the manual alphabet as well as rudimentary table manners.  As well as this work is written, it, like so many other works on Helen Keller, lags at that darn water pump where Helen finally learns that all things have a name.  The momentum that pushed the story along comes to a grinding halt at that tired water pump scene.<br /><br />It is a let down that this play stalls at this point because Helen and Annie had such an interesting impact on history based on their work and lives together.  I would have rated this 5 stars, but the play lags and drags at that darn water pump and gives minimal attention to Helen's linguistic/cognitive progress from that minute forward. It seems kind of sad that so many works about Helen get lost at the water pump, never to move forward.	2000-12-02

A BOOK THAT WILL RESONATE IN YOUR MEMORY	This beautifully illustrated book and equally beautiful story will touch everyone who is fortunate to read or hear of it.<br />The Star of David, the symbol of the Jewish faith took a prominent place in history during the Second World War.  King Christian X, an especially beloved monarch had made a commitment to all Danes:  he would protect them in every way possible.<br />During the early part of the war, Nazi soldiers replaced the Danish flag with a Nazi flag.  King Christian had the flag replaced with the Danish flag.  Nazi officials interrogated the king, who declared that if any Nazi carried out the threat to shoot whoever removed the Nazi flag, then that assassin would be guilty of killing the king because he, King Christian X would remove that Nazi flag himself!  Seeing how imprudent challenging this king would be, the Nazi officer declared that all Jewish people in Denmark had to identify themselves by wearing a Star of David emblazoned on their clothing.<br />King Christian X, after long and hard thought, came up with a solution.  He decreed that ALL Danes would wear the Star of David and the Nazis wouldn't be any the wiser as to who was Jewish.  He called for unity and solidarity among his Danish subjects.<br />This is such a moving, heartwarming story of how love and solidarity faced up to evil and cruelty.

We really do need this story.<br />I really love this book.	2000-12-01

Joe and Marcy's friends, Clarence Sr. and his wife complain about how people &quot;act stupid around them&quot; because they are an interracial couple.  Joe tells them, &quot;friend, they aren't ACTING.&quot;  Translation:  If folks can't accept interracial families, then the stupidity is NOT an act.  I LOVE THAT STRIP!<br />The Jump Start kids, Sunny and baby Jojo are adorable.  I love the way Sunny remains bilingual -- fluent in English and baby talk.  Baby Jojo acts like a crib sized executive with his day care pal Benny his faithful partner/employee/man Friday.  It is so hilarious to see the way the kids interact!<br />I love all the strips when Sunny runs from the comb.  One can almost feel her pain during these feared comb out sessions.  Is there a child in the world who likes to have their hair done?  I sometimes doubt that.  I love the one where Sunny thinks dreadlocks will save her from the comb.

She survived a litany of therapists, some of whom appeared to use questionable judgment where she was concerned.<br />Throughout it all, one gets the sense that the author is laughing at the &quot;mockery&quot; of the institution of therapy.  It is possible that the &quot;mockingbird&quot; she identifies with is really  mocking those who treated her.  It is also possible that she identifies with the mockingbird because of Atticus' famous statement that all a mockingbird ever did was make nice music and never harm anything.  One wonders if she feels as innocuous as that bird as well as skilled at mimicry.  These are interesting ideas to explore.<br />I liked the book and feel this author did an excellent job of injecting humor into a very serious subject.

He is a most welcome addition to the regular cast.  He is truly a treaasure.<br />Edgar, the dog and Mr. B., the bunny are a riot!  I love the way that rascally rabbit chases the dog!  He bites Edgar on the nose and makes a shambles out of that living room.  I love that rabbit!<br />April is the one exception.  I find her a fresh mouthed princess.  Instead of helping Elly when she goes through &quot;the change,&quot; Princess-pie demands a raise in her allowance.  I have never once seen her pitch in around that house and everybody caters to her.  She wears babyish overalls and has past the age where one can realistically say &quot;gots&quot; and expect others to find it cute or acceptable.  Her long-suffering sister often takes the blame for April's misdeeds and the nasty brat has never once owned up to anything she has done.  She provokes other kids and gets away with sheer murder.  I really don't like her.<br />I love the suporting cast.  Gordon is my favorite.  He has matured from a geeky kid who was retained a year into a successful businessowner, husband and father.  He is the cartoon version of a success story.  Hurray for Gordon!	2000-11-27

Unable to see, hear or speak, Helen communicated by a series of rudimentary signs and showed great precocity in learning to fold clothing and recognizing her own.  She was also unruly and given to fits of temper, which was understandable considering her lack of access to ready communication.<br />When Helen was 3 months off 7, her now famous teacher, Annie Sullivan was hired to work with her.  The redoubtable Ms. Sullivan taught Helen the manual alphabet and from her stellar progress at identifying familiar objects, taught her Braille as well.  Helen's progress is nothing short of spectacular and she makes an impressive academic showing at the Perkins Institute for the Blind in Boston.<br />I liked the fact that this book did not dwell on that now tired scene at the water pump when Helen learns after having &quot;water&quot; spelled onto her fingers that &quot;all things have a name.&quot;  Instead of gasping and losing speed after the now overworked water pump scene, this biography picks up speed and the reader is treated to following Helen's academic progress at Perkins and later as a Radcliffe alumna.<br />This book glosses over Helen's radical socialism during her adulthood and also glosses over the challenges she and Annie faced as they matured together.  It's a nice biography, but you do end up wanting more.	2000-11-26

This is one of the best biographies of Robert Kennedy I have read to date.  This author not only treats him with respect, but has the foresight and good sense to stay with factual information and not speculations and sensationalism.<br />Mr. Sidorenko does an excellent, probing in-depth analysis of Robert Kennedy.  What makes this book such a welcome contribution is that it focuses on the late Senator's spiritualism.  A devout Catholic, Robert Kennedy took his faith seriously from all accounts.  He is the only one of the sons who wears the stamp of Rose Kennedy.  Religious and reclusive, the redoubtable matriarch left an indelible stamp on this penultimate son.  His face is the face of Rose; the physical resemblance is quite strong.  His faith was inspired by  her own; he was the altar boy who would, later in his life travel with his Bible and admit how important Catholicism was to him.<br />A man of strong convictions, Robert Kennedy let himself be pushed into public service in early adulthood.  He admitted his own self doubts on numerous occasions, but never once shirked a duty.  He was the man who pushed himself in all areas of his life; as a boy, he tried to teach himself how to swim.  Some 35 years later, he would work with top mountain climbers to prepare to climb a Canadian Mountain that was named after his late brother, President Kennedy.  Robert Kennedy suffered from acrophobia, yet he was able to table his fear and climb that mountain!  Once atop Mt. Kennedy, the then new Senator made the  Sign of the Cross and did, throughout the remainder of his life make spiritual references to the late president.<br />Robert Kennedy was a self-educated man; he would, in adulthood make himself aware of Civil Rights related issues.  He would also develop a strong knowledge base of classical literature.  He drew on a myriad of references and, from all accounts kept his mind open to receiving new information.<br />This is such a wonderful book.  I highly recommend it.	2000-11-21

A survivor of paternal abuse, abandonment in a poorhouse with her terminally ill brother and a nearly-lifelong battle with trachoma all hardened Ms. Macy's armor.  She was so bright and determined that she made a good academic showing at the Perkins Institute for the Blind and it was through this noted institution that she was assigned to work with Helen Keller, who suffered the dual challenges of being blind and deaf.<br />One admires her gritty determination; she survives the poor house, which was a genuine Chamber of Horrors; she survives being relegated there with her terminally ill brother as no other relatives were willing to take her in; she survives the painful loss of her brother and the subsequent losses of others she came to know in the poor house.<br />This is a good starter book and provides interesting information about Anne Sullivan Macy's life.  The one drawback is that it does get stuck at the water pump where Helen learned, from Ms. Macy's constant spelling into her hand that all things have a name.  This &quot;watershed&quot; landmark in Helen Keller's life is, in her words, &quot;her soul's birthday.&quot;  Helen, then nearly 7, learned at the now famous water pump that all things can be identified by name.  For her, that singular lesson served as her lifelong key to communication.<br />I admit, I do get rather tired of that water pump scene because many otherwise good works seem to get stuck there.  Many books that cover Helen Keller, this one included, languish at the water pump and with what little speed the book has left gives scant attention to the many accomplishments these women made and their indelible stamp on history.	2000-11-21

Deaf and blind since the age of 1 1/2, Helen communicated by a means of crude signs.  Desperate to reach their child, Helen's parents hired a young &quot;teacher,&quot; named Anne Sullivan.  Nearly blind herself, Annie spelled words into Helen's hand in order to impress upon her the concept of identifying all objects and people.  This book does a good job of not remaining stuck at the water pump where Annie's lesson reached its mark.<br />I like the way the book follows Helen's progress and follows her down the road beyond that water pump.  She becomes a fund raiser for other deaf-blind children and is a supporter of the Perkins Institute for the Blind, where she is a student.  She embarks on fund raisers and sends numerous letters to newspapers banging on the drum for persons both deaf and blind.  Tommy Stringer, a young boy from the Philadelphia area becomes Helen's first &quot;charge.&quot;  Once having raised the money for Tommy's entrance to the Kindergarten for the Blind at Perkins, Helen's quest to do even more for other children in need snowballs.  More deaf and blind children are admitted to Perkins through Helen's soldierly efforts and this takes place when she is not quite 12!<br />This book does an admirable job of making Helen Keller accessible to younger readers.  It is a book I would recommend.	2000-11-21

Any information that people can acquire to help children facing special needs is welcomed and appreciated.  This book is such a teaching tool.  Sadly, many lay persons' knowledge of autism has been confined to the cliche character of \\"Rain Man.\\"  Savantism applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and sadly, \\"Rain Man\\" has become a negative stereotype for people with autism.<br /><br />This is one of the most heartwarming, uplifting litany of successes I have had the good fortune and pleasure to read.  Ms. Stehli, whose own daughter, Georgiana was labeled \\"autistic\\" is a shining beacon of success.  Now married and a mother, Georgiana was nonverbal until the age of four despite having mastered all other milestones within normal age limits.  She had hyper acute hearing and literally had to learn how to synthesize her senory modes.  Fluent in six languages, Georgiana is an advocate of Auditory Integration Therapy (AIT) and is also an author on the subject.<br /><br />AIT is a science that is targets auditory processing challenges and, from all accounts, aims to work with clients to gradually integrate what they hear into manageable units; e.g., individual words and/or sounds at one time.  AIT also helps people concentrate without being distracted by other sensory modes.  A Dr. Berard has made AIT a recognized science and this book, \\"Dancing in the Rain\\" brings his work to the lay reader.  This book is truly a song to the soul, a cheer to the conscience and a voice of encouragement.  This book is the voice of hope for many.<br /><br />Autism and related neurological disorders such as Aspergers and PDD are fully explained in Ms. Stehli's works.  Unfortunately for many, \\"autism\\" and \\"schizophrenia\\" have been used as \\"waste basket\\" or catch-all labels for persons who fit no defined criteria. One costly misperception that persisted until recent years was that autism is a mental illness, which it most emphatically is not. This book helps to undermine labels and focus on integrating people with a myriad of behaviorial as well as neurological challenges back into the mainstream.<br /><br />Another highly damning and judgmental perjorative is the word \\"perseverate\\" in any tense. It is a truly dreadful word.  While many professionals, parents included might find it a helpful shorthand, it is still an extremely negative, highly charged and destructive word that has hurt many. The terms \\"repetitive verbalizations/behaviors\\" and \\"special interests\\" are preferable as they speak to tolerance.<br /><br />Based on Dr. Berard's writings, autism and its related behaviors are often a curious response to an overload of sensory input. Georgiana describes AIT as literally saving her life and the stories chronicled in this book make a very strong case for AIT indeed.  In reading Dr. Berard's writings, one can see that his findings certainly do appear valid; other persons once thought of as autistic such as Raun Kaufman (\\"Son-Rise\\") seem to share the challenge of sorting out sensory input.<br /><br />I feel this book is quite helpful and I cannot recommend it highly enough.s book helps to undermine labels and focus on integrating people with a myriad of behaviorial as well as neurological challenges back into the mainstream.

He revisits this period in his life by playacting &quot;baby&quot; and &quot;baby bear&quot; with Dr. Rogers playing &quot;mama bear&quot; who saves &quot;baby from the forest fire.&quot;  This no doubt is a reference to when Ben was abandoned in a burning building at age one.  He is finally adopted by a loving couple who have sought all types of treatment for this boy who was only recently toilet trained prior to his admission at Glenwood.<br />During Ben's sessions, the themes of &quot;baby&quot; and &quot;fires&quot; are re-enacted.  In one memorable session, Ben arrives in an angel suit to show the doctor his innate goodness.<br />As they progress further in treatment, Dr. Rogers unearths her own traumatic past.  She retreats into silence and is ultimately  hospitalized.  She is also devastated by the refusal of another professional to maintain contact with her.  This professional, identified as &quot;Melanie Sherman&quot; appears to be singularly callous in cutting all ties with Dr. Rogers.  Like Ben, Dr. Rogers uses nature themed metaphors to describe her displacement.  She identifies with the lone bird, circling above the city, sad-eyed and searching.<br />It is to her great fortune that she is treated by the gentle, gifted Dr. Blumenthal.  Dr. Blumenthal treats her with respect and at no time does he challenge her when she expresses a delusional concept.  He takes her seriously and also tries to soften the blow she feels about Melanie's loss.  (One wonders if Melanie was really worth it).  Dr. Blumenthal helps Dr. Rogers piece her pysche much like a mental quilt; in reassembling her shattered image, she is able to see her abusive mother with clarity instead of in fragmented short steps.<br />Dr. Blumenthal is truly an angel and a shining, sterling example of humane treatment in therapy.  Dr. Rogers, once discharged and back at Glenwood, can use his techniques with Ben.<br />This is a very powerful book of how parallel the lives of doctor and patient are and how similar their boundaries really were.sembling her shattered image, she is able to see her abusive mother with clarity instead of in fragmented short steps.<br />Dr. Blumenthal is truly an angel and a shining, sterling example of humane treatment in therapy.

This author, to her credit, provides a rich source of information and introduces the readers at large to Helen the student, Helen the writer, Helen the adult and Helen as one third of a strange triadic relationship when her beloved &quot;Teacher&quot; marries a gifted editor named John Macy.<br />Helen and Annie had a rather symbiotic relationship and this was never made more apparent than when other educators as well as Helen's mother tried to prize them apart.  John Macy, Annie's long suffering husband tired of having to include Helen in every aspect of his married life and felt that Annie was making Helen &quot;more of an institution than a woman.&quot;  He further charged Annie with being a self serving promotor and felt that Helen was being exploited.<br />This work does indeed raise some very interesting ideas.  Annie does indeed have a punitive streak, no doubt influenced by her abusive, alcoholic father and the lost years she spent in the alms-house.  The alms-house was, by all accounts a genuine Chamber of Horrors and no provisions were made for children.  Annie survived the gritty horrors, including the death of her beloved baby brother, Jimmie.  Hardened and determined after years of battling poor vision due to trachoma, she makes a fine academic showing at the Perkins School for the Blind prior to her assignment with Helen.<br />During the early part of their symbiotic relationship, Annie would slap Helen into submission.  The now infamous Battle Over Breakfast was a case in point.  Annie slapped Helen each time the child tried to take food off Annie's plate.  She also slapped Helen each time she pinched her in rage.<br />Annie would use similar exacting methods on Helen in later years.  When Helen learned to type, Annie would have her redo a page many times until it was picture perfect.  Indeed, this too, presented problems in Annie's marriage.  When she and John Macy split, the letters he received from &quot;Helen&quot; had hand written corrections and were rife with expressions that were plainly Annie's.  One can only speculate that John was correct in his assessment of Helen being exploited to a certain extent.<br />This book takes into account Helen's concept of spirituality and her fascination with Swedenborgianism, a faith rooted in &quot;a perfect afterlife where nobody is handicapped.&quot;  Helen clings to this faith and later to an especially inflammatory branch of Socialism.  She becomes quite political and writes numerous articles expressing her beliefs.  In so doing, Helen remains fixed in the public eye as the Crusader for persons both deaf and blind.<br />This is truly an excellent biography that explores the sensual side of Helen, the spiritual, the political and the personal make up of this quite extraordinary woman.

Helen Keller, blind and deaf since infancy depended on Annie since the age of 6 when the latter was hired to teach her.<br />This comprehensive, fascinating and completely riviting biography does an excellent job of separating the two women's lives and analyzing each woman in her own right.  Helen takes giant steps beyond the water pump where Annie first impressed upon her the concept of language.  It is to this author's credit that the reader does not languish at that water pump, but follows these women throughout their lives.<br />The true symbiosis is fully described when other teachers as well as Helen's own mother Kate, try to separate her from Annie.  Feeling that her maternal authority had been usurped, Kate understandably wanted to wean Helen from Annie.  Each attempt by any person to effect such a change resulted in disaster.  Even Annie's marriage to a gifted editor named John Macy ended in an acrimonious split because he felt Helen took up too large a portion of their lives together.  From all accounts, Macy seemed to feel that Annie used the same domineering methods she had used on the child Helen with him.  He also described Annie as &quot;manipulative and controlling,&quot; which certainly seem like apt descriptions of her approach.  Resentful of Helen's constant presence and feeling like an odd member of an equally odd triadic relationship, John retreats further from the marriage.<br />When Annie dies, Helen is disconsolate; she feels she can't survive without her &quot;Teacher,&quot; although she, by that point had been at Annie's side for nearly half a century.  A bright, progressive woman named Polly assumes the role of &quot;Teacher,&quot; and Helen flourishes under her gentle tutlage and interpretation.  Polly is clearly accepting of Helen's challenges and appears to make a sincere effort to see that Helen is fully included in all conversations and activities which she [Polly] is part of.  One does not get the sense that Polly is a martyr.  One gets the impression that Polly is loyal and determined with no agenda of her own.<br />Helen's relationship with Polly does appear to be much healthier than her relationship with Annie.

I have read it several times in the intervening years, the most recent time being within the past one year.<br />Helen Keller, blind and deaf since the age of 1 1/2 has offered, in her own words an accounting of her life experience.  It is incredible to imagine how this woman, unable to see or hear can give such a strong voice to descriptions of nature.  The book is replete with beautiful, articulate metaphors that draw the reader into the world as Helen knew it.  One wonders how a person with no language can &quot;think,&quot; and Helen provides some clues.  During these &quot;dark days,&quot; prior to the arrival of her &quot;Teacher,&quot; Annie Sullivan, Helen's life was a series of desires and impressions.  She could commnicate by a series of crude signs she and her parents had created.  She demonstrated early on that she could learn.<br />I like the way Helen herself takes her readers past that water pump when she learned that &quot;all things have a name.&quot;  Instead of getting stuck there, Helen takes her readers on the journey of her life to that point.<br />In addition to having a good linguistic base, Helen also demonstrates having a phenomenal memory.  When she was twelve, she wrote a story she believed to be her own.  Entitled &quot;The Frost King,&quot; it bore a strong resemblance to one written by a Ms. Canby called &quot;The Frost Fairies.&quot;  Many of the sentences are identical and a good number of the descriptions are paraphrased.  In relating this devasting incident, Helen and Annie recall that Annie had exposed Helen to the story some three years earlier and Helen had somehow retained that information.  This plainly shows intelligence.<br />Both the &quot;Frost&quot; stories are reprinted in full, thus giving the reader a chance to see just how amazing being able to remember such a work really was.<br />Helen describes her work raising money for other deaf-blind children to attend the Perkins School for the Blind in Boston and in so doing, embarks upon her lifelong mission as a crusader for multiply challenged individuals.l for the Blind in Boston and in so doing, embarks upon her lifelong mission as a crusader for multiply challenged individuals.	2000-11-12

This book had no depth and offered no real information about the care, breeding and history of this unique breed.  Instead of focusing on beagles, the owner describes a beagle mix.  I admit I was a little dismayed that the book did not focus exclusively on the pure beagle. People who own pure beagles or folks who are considering becoming owners of beagles would find more information in any of a number of books on the subject or by traveling on the internet.  This book really offers no information and its &quot;bark&quot; is worse than its &quot;bite.&quot;	2000-10-31

This comprehensive book is a real treat for serious, die-hard Beatles fans.  It has a myriad of previously unpublished photographs and all of the photographs in the book are first rate.<br />The book does a real service by covering each band member.  I really enjoyed the &quot;updates&quot; of each surviving Beatle.  The interviews of the three surviving Beatles throughout the 1990s was refreshing and certainly provided unique insights into the (I think) world's number one band. John was quoted extensively throughout the book and the inclusion of John's comments was vital to the construction of the group.  Hailed as the &quot;Chief Beatle,&quot; John, now deceased was certainly a central figure and input by and about him was vital.  These updates provided the reader with a sense of each Beatle; one came away feeling that they had a relatively accurate portrayal of the input and interpersonal relationship of each member.<br />On a lighter note, one smiles at the adolescent hijinks of the Beatles in their pre-glory days.  The &quot;Fab 4&quot; are portrayed as normal kids engaging in typical teenage rebellion and mischief.  In reading a description of George's &quot;sexual rite of passage,&quot; one can almost smile at the sheer adolescence of it.  Ringo, the lovable basset hound eyed drummer describes of a harsh life in the rough Dingle section of Liverpool and of the crowd he ran with in his salad days.  Paul appears to be &quot;prematurely mature,&quot; and John was a natural comic.  John had a WICKED sense of humor and a DELICIOUS gift for the satirical.  He was a riot!  This book does justice to John's work and the compositions he and Paul shared with the world.<br />I loved this book and I would certainly recommend it.  This is a work to be treasured and taken seriously.	2000-10-30

Salinger's daughter has written an in-depth psychological biography of her famous (or infamous) father.  Margaret (then called &quot;Peggy&quot;) drills the Iron Curtain surrounding her reclusive father and her life in his shadow.<br />Margaret has a gift for finding joy in many things; her account of her kindergarten class is singularly moving and one feels that the &quot;circle&quot; she lovingly described during this activity was a symbol of the &quot;circles&quot; she would later move in -- as daugher of a famous author, as a literati in her own &quot;write,&quot; as her own identity.  She manages to wring joy out of her horrendous boarding school years; she manages to infuse her readers with her naturally hopeful outlook.<br />J. D. Salinger's &quot;signature&quot; book, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is an adult version of Peter Pan; Salinger's infamous protagonist Holden Caulfield is a self-admitted adultophobe who refuses to take responsibility for his actions or identify with adult persons.  I didn't like Caulfield as a child and I certainly have not been able to like that character as an adult, either.  In reading it in adulthood, one cannot help but wonder how much of Holden is really J. D. Salinger.  Margaret provides some very interesting insights.<br />Salinger's treatment of author Joyce Maynard when the later was 18 was disgusting.  He tried to control Maynard's life and it sounded as if he was generally taking advantage of her.  In reading of this part of his life, one again sees glimpses of Caulfield.  Salinger sought the company of a woman young enough to be his daughter and his treatment of her was singularly disgraceful.<br />This book is truly an eye-opener.  It is a well researched biography and well worth the read.	2000-10-02

Charles Higham has done a thorough job of researching Rose Kennedy, her forebears as well as those of Joe Kennedy, Sr.  This book takes a daring peek behind the curtain of Rose's outward gentility; one is forced to confront the adulterous Joe through her eyes; one feels sympathy for Rose as she, by many accounts, those of her children included, becomes even more religious and reclusive.<br />One feels her anguish over Joe's decision to have poor Rosemary lobotomized without at least consulting her; one feels her anguish over the violent, devastating deaths of three of her four sons.<br />I liked the parts that detailed some of the interactions Rose had with her many grandchildren; I especially loved the parts about her son Robert, the then future Attorney General and Senator.<br />I found the dynamics of intrafamilial relationships quite interesting.  In many accounts, the indomitable matriarch and Jack locked horns and had many personality clashes.  In all accounts, she and RFK had a unique bond.  The resemblance between Rose and Robert is quite strong; indeed, the matriarch left her stamp on this penultimate son who would later comfort her in her old age and invite her to accompany him on his 1964 senatorial campaign.  This pair has been described as being extremely devout and loyal to their children; again, this similarity is emphasized in the bonds the future Attorney General had with his own children.<br />I felt this was a very well researched and well written biography.  For anyone who is seriously interested in Rose Kennedy, I would recommend this book highly.	2000-09-29

She leaves Boston to join the woman she recognized as her mother all of her life only to be told that she and her brother are not related to one another nor to the mother!  These children were bought from a black market doctor in Oklahoma who literally lives by the credo of &quot;you came in the doctor's black [market] bag.&quot; Devastated that she cannot donate blood or bone marrow to the man she had long believed was her brother, Jaye sets off on a mission to discover her real identity and that of her &quot;brother's&quot; as well.  She returns to the insulated town of Cawdor, Oklahoma where the black market doctor's influence is prevalent and insidious.

Sharyn McCrumb is a gifted author with a real flair for creating voice, character and setting.  In this case, the setting is a science fiction convention and the characters range from the scholarly Dr. James Owen Mega (aka &quot;Jay Omega&quot;) and Marion, a professor.  These two literati encounter an ecelectic group of students, people dressed as sci-fi characters, authors and other interested parties.  Appin Dungannon, a man small in stature and long in chutzpah and crudity dominates the convention.  An angry little dynamo, he manages to deliberately rile everybody at that convention.  He ends up dead and the REAL mystery is WHO DID IT?<br />I have never read such a hilarious mystery as this.  As good as its sequel, &quot;Zombies of the Gene Pool&quot; is, this book is still the better of the two.  The characters who have actually crossed over and believe they ARE the sci-fi characters and good old Appin himself will leave you laughing.  One singularly hilarious part in the book is when Appin refuses to autograph his books.  When pressed by an autograph hound, Appin signs the name of another very well known author, thus enraging the autograph hounds.  This book is a work of comic art.  I loved it!	2000-09-29

It is a great story, but impossible of course.  In this account of the late Senator's life, his story becomes a fictionalized account of being allowed to return to earth as a moving man.<br />I love the way the fictionalized Senator/Moving Man fits in with the 9:00 - 5:00 crowd, perfectly at ease with politicos and blue collar workers as well as the folks he goes on runs for.  He is the man for everyone; the regular guy who gives his job his fullest effort.  One can imagine the Senator whom we remember seeing with shirt sleeves rolled up, hard at work on the campaign trail or poring over work in his office on a moving run, sleeves up, sweating and grunting while moving somebody's heavy sofa or living room set.  Robert Kennedy was nobody's slacker and this fictionalized portrayal of him will certainly bring smiles to many faces.<br />Just think -- the next time one of your moving men gives his job his best effort without an occasional glance at the clock, you just might think of the late Senator.	2000-09-27

One of my fondest memories was watching the then Senator on the evening news and my mother telling me that &quot;Senator [Robert] Kennedy is a man who cares about people. That's why we voted for him.&quot;  I believed that fully.<br />This is a book I would have LOVED as a child.  This is a book I respect as an adult.  I feel it gives young readers a good overview of the Senator's life and character and makes him somebody they can relate to.  We follow the progress of little Bobby, 8 and 10 years younger than brothers Jack and Joe respectively determined to keep up with them.  We smile at the small boy who was so determined to teach himself to swim that he flung himself into the ocean at age 4.  Some 35 years later, we see that same little boy, now a Senator, determined to climb a previously unscaled mountain in Canada.  He was a man who suffered from acrophobia, but he tabled his terror and climbed that mountain out of love for his brother.<br />Robert Kennedy is a hard worker and his life is a litany of hard won successes.  He had to live with people comparing him to his brother Jack, who was elected president in 1960.  He had to contend with the feeling that he was still trying to keep up with Jack.  It is only in the tragic aftermath of Jack's death does the full adult face of Robert Kennedy emerge -- the man who had previously worked behind the scenes promoting his brother becomes a KNOWN force to be taken seriously.  He is the man who in addition to pursuing teamsters and mafiosi (&quot;bad guys who break the law&quot;) finds his own voice, his own interests and his own identity beyond the shadow of his brother.  He is the man who, in the last half decade of his life became the voice for many.  He was better than a great man.  Robert Kennedy was a good man.<br />That same caring side is brought out on issues concerning minorities, poverty and civil rights.  The man who would be president in 1968 comes across as serious and sincere in his efforts.  As we track him on the campaign trail in 1968, we are left with the painful question of what the intervening years would have been had he lived to win that presidential election.as serious and sincere in his efforts.

She gives an excellent, in-depth accounting of the man's early life, the experiences that shaped his character as a man.  We see young Bobby, at age 4, hurling himself into the ocean, determined to teach himself how to swim.  That experience follows him throughout his life and it is that single determined approach he appears to take on most stands.  As an undergraduate, he doggedly pursues a place on the football field and as an adult, he doggedly pursues Teamsters and Mafiosi.  In reading of his interrogation of the men he regarded as &#34;foes,&#34; one can almost imagine a little Bobby superimposed on the face of the future Attorney General, flinging himself headlong into the ocean determined to swim.  And swim he does in the face of the Rackets Committee (aka &#34;Get [Jimmy]Hoffa Squad.&#34;)<br /><br />In 1965,  Robert Kennedy, then a Senator undertakes another grueling challenge.  A self admitted acrophobe, he along with Mt. Everestt climbers Barry Prather and Jim Whittaker scale Mt. Kennedy, a previously unscaled Canadian Mountain.  One tracks his progress as he makes his way up that mountain, only to emerge victorious on March 27, 1965.  The boy who taught himself to swim was revisited in the man who climbed that mountain.<br /><br />Robert Kennedy was my very first hero as a child and this is a book I would have LOVED! (I STILL have my 1968 copies of &#34;Life&#34; in re the assassination).  His work with civil rights issues, Farmworkers, minorities and other disenfranchised persons certainly makes for interesting reading.  This book does him a big service by portraying him in a very sympathetic light.  Readers do come away with the feeling that the man was sincere in his efforts and the question is always left hanging -- what would the outcome of this world today be had this man lived to be elected president in 1968?	2000-09-27

During the Camelot years, the public was fed a bill of goods.  The mythical Camelot of musical fame had a mythical counterpart during the JFK administration.  This book covers the president's position on issues and, unfortunately some of the more questionable decisions he made regarding his private life.<br />Robert Kennedy, on the other hand was the man who worked behind the scenes.  From all accounts, the young lawyer and later Attorney General sublimated his own interests, needs and identity so as to push his brother forward.  Robert Kennedy was the clean up man, the one who from many accounts shielded his brother to the best of his ability.<br />When President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, people mourned the loss of Camelot.  Sadly, what I think people during that era were really mourning was the loss of the illusion of the &quot;picture perfect&quot; White House world.<br />Robert Kennedy literally came into his own following his brother's tragic death and, it is he who inadvertently &quot;left the lights on&quot; in Camelot.  He was the man who, in his own inimitable fashion exposed the myth of Camelot to the light of day during the LBJ White House years.  It was Robert Kennedy who actively campaigned for Civil Rights issues and who, along with Johnson (interestingly, these men were at sword's points) forced the world at large to confront some harsh societal ills that the illusion of Camelot omitted.	2000-09-27

Your heart goes out to Chloris, whose father committed suicide some eight years earlier when she was eight.  He squandered her inheritance, so unfortunately her bratty younger sister gets the lion's share.  Chloris has a mother who shouldn't happen to a buzzard and her life is miserable largely because of these two wretches.<br />Chloris could never accept her step father, Fidel Mancha.  In this installment of the &quot;Chloris&quot; trilogy, her mother has divorced Fidel and she and her bratty sister Jenny are living with this shrew.  I could not stand their mother.  She would go on slapping sprees and hurt Chloris.  I wish JENNY had been slapped!  She is such a phony.  To add insult to injury, that nasty woman would snidely refer to Chloris as &quot;she&quot; and &quot;your sister&quot; to Jenny.  She was never nice to Chloris and in one memorable section of the book, she calls Chloris a &quot;mean, rotten child&quot; who does not deserve any tears or sympathy because she took off for a fun weekend with friends sans permission.  I hated Jenny and the way she attacked Chloris and cut her lip upon the latter's return home.  That stupid mother put everything before Chloris -- her love life, her friends, Jenny and even inanimate objects.  I would never wish a mother like that or that disgusting sister Jenny on anyone.  This book belongs in the wastebasket.	2000-09-24

A favored, bratty younger sister, a father who committed suicide some three years earlier and a mother who shouldn't happen to a mongrel dog. Chloris' father squandered all the insurance money that she was supposed to inherit, but leaves bratty Jenny well off. What a bummer. Chloris has a vain, spoiled, immature mother who craves the attention of men.  After remarrying a man named Fidel Mancha, Chloris rebuffs Mancha and refuses to  let him adopt her or her favored brat of a sister.<br />I hated the way that disgusting mother would go on slapping sprees to Chloris.

Rose Kennedy was clearly a very intelligent and literate woman from all accounts and this shows in her memoir.<br /><br />My favorite parts of this book are the parts outlining the growth and development of Robert Kennedy.  We watch him remain in character.  His progress is tracked from the time he doggedly tried to teach himself to swim at age 4 to some 35 years later, in 1965 when the then Senator, an acrophobe, climbed a previously unscaled mountain in Canada out of love for his slain brother.  Robert Kennedy was a stubborn, determined hardworking person and these traits showed up early in his life.<br /><br />From all accounts, Rose and Robert Kennedy were close.  In looking at pictures of the mother and the son the physical resemblance is quite strong. Robert Kennedy was the only one of the sons to have the \\"Fitzgerald\\" face.  Like his maternal grandfather who, in Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, \\"the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,\\" Mayor John Fitzgerald took up a rigorous physical regimen to develop himself into a runner and augment his physical strength.  We see this same characteristic in Robert Kennedy, the boy who tried to teach himself to swim, the undergrad who was determined to show his mettle on the football field and the man who would, in 1965 climb that mountain.  Both mother and son shared a deep devotion to Catholicism and both were consistently described as serious and committed to following their social consciences.<br /><br />This book is such a treasure chest of memories and is well worth reading time and again.	2000-09-23

As bad as one felt for the author, her love life really had nothing to do with Bibi.<br />It is to Ms. Thernstrom's credit that she cared so much about Bibi that this book was ever written.

It is written entirely in the 3rd person and each character is profiled throughout the book. The story is mainly focussed on several young mothers, all of whom have babies under one. Sandy, the only mother who has a son is the group's unofficial &quot;leader.&quot; She is an appealling character who does some remarkably endearingly foolish things such as having a five month old birthday party for her son, Mark Jr. (She is the only married girl in their group.) Mark, Sr. and Sandy show some affluence among their carless peers by being the proud owners of a beautiful 1966 Plymouth Valiant (the sister to the Dodge Dart).<br /><br /> Tara is a laughably, lovably naive girl who claims she doesn't know any songs. In true hippie fashion, she names her daughter Sunshine and to escape her tyrannical mother, she later runs away with a group of hippies, Sunshine in tow.<br /><br /> Wanda, the only morbidly obese member of the group has a sickly daughter named Melissa. The baby's paternal grandmother is a weird bird who has the bizarre twin obsessions of ducks and blueberries. She feeds the baby &quot;Blueberry Buckle&quot; baby food, and makes a big production out of knitting duck sweaters for Melissa and other babies in the neighborhood. Ducks and blueberries. What an eccentric character.<br /><br /> Joyce Maynard is a gifted writer whose works remain timely and topical. She has a real gift for pulling things into sharp focus and this, in turn, keeps readers focussed on her work.	2000-09-23

First off, I don't like the  way she seduces Bart, Sr.  I also don't like Julian Marquet or his pushy  mother.  They are a pair of dancing fools.  Cathy was a fool to marry  Julian and an even bigger fool to take up an uxorial role with her brother,  Christopher.  V.C. Andrews (this was the REAL V.C. Andrews and not the GW)  has run that tired theme of brother-and-sister incestuous relationships  underground.  The stories are all more or less predictable.<br />The V. C.  Andrews has never been at a loss for monstrous females, starting with the  grandmother Olivia, the shallow, stupid mother Corinne who locked the  children in the attic for over three years and killed her youngest child,  Cory, and of course, Cathy the Fiend. Cathy is singularly horrific.  Forcing Carrie to leave Paul's comfortable house where she was loved and  happy, was the height of stupid and unfair.  It was too bad Carrie didn't  just point blank refuse to go with Cathy when the latter insisted they head  north, near the Foxworth estate.  When Carrie commits suicide, one can  easily feel that Cathy was to a large extent responsible for Carrie's act.  If she hadn't pressured Carrie to leave Paul's, Carrie would have been  spared the horror of revisiting the Foxworth years.  Cathy belongs in the  toilet with the other sewage.	2000-09-19

One can bet she has a Roy, Jr. or a  girl with a nature themed name.  The Rain series would have been good if  Rain and Roy had kept their relationship fraternal as they were raised like  siblings.

I read it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Mr. Thomas gives a very  credible, in-depth analysis of Robert Kennedy and, to his credit, treats  him with respect.  One thing that I neglected to mention in my first review  is Mr. Thomas' trenchant view on Robert Kennedy's pursuit of mafiosi.  The  late Senator's father was reported to have had mafia sympathies.  Whether  or not he did, Joe Sr.'s third son was the only one determined to quell the  mafia.  Suggesting that Robert Kennedy, then a man in his 30s was showing  an albeit delayed rebellious side to the old patriach was indeed thought  provoking.  Most accounts of the late Senator's life describe him as being  a &quot;dutiful&quot; son, an &quot;obedient&quot; and even  &quot;deferential.&quot;  It is a refreshing viewpoint on the part of Mr.  Thomas and certainly a valid one.	2000-09-13

Whitney book with this title is reviewed below.<br /><br />I am going to break this to potential readers gently. This is a pathetic story and a tired, frayed cliche. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />Lindsay Phillips is the protagonist. Half-Navajo and half-Anglo, she chafes at being born out of wedlock and being raised by her stepmother and half sister. Her father, Jed is killed at the opening of the story and he sounded like a thorough rat. Lindsay's mother dies at or shortly after childbirth, so Jed takes the girl to his wife to be raised with his other daughter, Sybil. Lindsay has a maternal half sister named Alice, whom we meet later in the story.<br /><br />Sybil is a cliche literary sociopath. Resentful of Lindsay from the outset, she torments the girl, cuts up her doll clothes (Lindsay's interest in making doll clothes led to a career as a clothing designer in N.Y.) and throws a pair of scissors at her, narrowly missing her face. Sybil is the classic spoiled antagonist who, unlike wine, does not improve with age.<br /><br />Jed favors Lindsay and all but ignores Sybil. This is not good for family relationships. It is interesting that the stepmother, who has no name and is only mentioned in passing, readily accepted Lindsay and her father's open admission of adultery. Was she a saint or a martyr? That is never answered.<br /><br />Sybil is consistently described as cruel and ill tempered. She does, however, marry one Rick Adams and move to Arizona. Out of this union is a daughter named Marilla. Lindsay has had a crush on Jed since she first met him at age 17. (She and Sybil were 8 years apart).<br /><br />When Jed dies after a wild life in Arizona (Sybil and Lindsay were raised in Connecticut), Lindsay flies to Arizona to trace her heritage. Once there, she learns from her brother-in-law that her natural mother died shortly after her birth and that she, Lindsay, was born in Arizona. Lindsay was so clueless about her own history and Rick filled in the blanks. Interestingly, Jed was Rick's mentor. Sybil springs the news of Lindsay's half-sister, Alice on Lindsay.<br /><br />Marilla keeps a safe distance from Sybil, who as we can guess by now, frowns on idealism, dreams and artist. Sybil resented Jed for rejecting her all of her life and dismisses his art as worthless. When Marilla shows artistic talent in pottery, she has to keep it a secret from the slithery Sybil.<br /><br />Rick and Lindsay, as one could readily predict inside of 5 minutes end up as lovers. Sybil is killed after she plans to recreate the meal and the setting where Jed was killed. The list of possible suspects is rather long as nobody was sad to see her go.<br /><br />Lindsay and Alice connect, Sybil is out of everyone's way and Lindsay and Rick become the cliche couple.

Bright and  beautiful, Jeremy spoke early and made all developmental milestones within  normal limits.  However, shortly after turning a year and a half, his  speech seemed to freeze in mid-developmental track and he began exhibiting  rigid ritualistic behaviors.  Luckily, the author had him enrolled in  preschool and had early intervention specialists working with Jeremy.  It  is through this loving effort that Jeremy was able to detour the more  traditional trappings of autism and enjoy a healthy, regular lifestyle.<br />I  loved the stories Jeremy told, especially the one where he would &quot;wait  for the Red Baron.&quot;  Beth Kephart, to her credit, joins Jeremy in this  wishful flight of fancy.<br />I did get a little impatient with the author  when she wanted to ram stories of her skating career down Jeremey's throat.  Jeremy was antsy and did not want to listen to this seemingly long drawn  out account.  I liked it when Jeremy was interested in his great  grandfather's car, a green 1969 Dodge Dart.  (I love Dodge Darts and for  me, the critical part of the story was answered -- the year and color of  the Dodge Dart).  Although that seems like a minor peeve, I did feel that  the author just wanted a forum to brag about her skating and forced this  story on Jeremy, ostensibly to help the boy increase his attention span for  listening skills.<br />All in all, it was a delightful read.  Jeremy walks in  the Sun of Health and really is a bright light.  I would highly recommend  this book.	2000-09-10

You  just can't like her.  She is hateful and selfish.  She is hard and unloving  as well as unlovable.  Her husband Steve, on the other hand, is a  sympathetic doctor.  He's the only likable character.<br />Meredith lives on  the fast corporate track.  It comes as no surpise that she meets Cal (Cal  from California -- if he was from Florida, would he be &quot;Flo&quot; from  Florida)? and as we can well predict, they ultimately have an affair.  One  is almost relieved when Steve and Meredith (&quot;Merrie&quot;) get  divorced.  Meredith was for the birds and I truly disliked her.<br />I agree  with the other reviewers who expressed extreme disgust for this book.  It  is truly a waste of time.  It is a complete bust.  Adultery is NOT romatic  and this book appears to condone the act.  That is a bad message. Meredith  is a cliche whiny yuppie barracuda who has not a single thing to recommend  her.  Steve is her opposite number.  He is a humane doctor to her ruthless  corporate career.  Why he puts up with her is anybody's guess.<br />I didn't  have to wait until I hit page 241 (as noted by another reviewer) that this  book was a complete bore.  That came through loud and clear from the  beginning.<br />Don't waste your time.  This book is a pathetic effort and I'm  sorry I borrowed it from the library.

Brendan threatens everyone there with imminent death by bomb.  The question nobody wanted to trigger was whether or not there was a bomb someplace in the building.  Readers will stick with this to the last page to see if the boys claim any casualties and whether or not the bomb threat is just a bluff.<br /><br />This is an excellent, cutting edge book that will give readers much to think about long after they have read the last page.  It is an excellent companion book to ENDGAME, THE LAST DOMINO and DARK ANGEL.  Each one of these books looks at how the life of a young person was twisted and distorted into that of a person capable of extreme cruelty and violence.	2000-09-06

Cassie was clearly a bright and  vibrant girl who had a lot to offer.<br />A few years prior to her tragic  death in Columbine, Cassie had dabbled in witchcraft and associated with a  very questionable element.  These young people ditched school, denounced  and renounced Christianity and sought power and popularity instead.  Cassie  listened to heavy metal with dark, hateful lyrics.<br />Her behavior so  alarmed her Christian parents and younger brother that they sought  immediate action.  Cassie's parents sold their house and moved to Columbine  to get her away from her witchcraft pals; they grounded her and read her  journals and watched her like hawks.  Naturally Cassie chafed and rebelled  against these newfound restrictions.<br />Her life detoured for the better  when she met a girl who belonged to a &quot;Christian&quot; group.  The  girl convinced Cassie to join her in a Christian camp and prevailed upon  the Bernalls to let her go.  Cassie went and, from all accounts, the trip  changed her life.<br />Cassie, a self proclaimed Christian admitted that prior  to meeting her new friend had been pulled by a dangerous force; it was the  force of Jesus and the Christians she met in the camp that put her on the  right track.<br />Her school work improved.  She participated in  extracurricular and community projects.  She wrote about God and described  how Jesus saved her from evil.  Her loving tributes to Jesus are very  moving and so worth reading.<br />It is this strongly rooted faith that Cassie  clung to and gave as her ultimate gift.  When her killers asked her on that  fatal day of April 20, 1999 if she belived in God, SHE SAID YES.<br />May God  bless Cassie and the Bernalls.<br />This beautiful book is one of Christian  bravery, sacrifice and generosity.  God bless Misty Bernall for having the  Christian courage to write this book.  It is very moving and will only  serve to reaffirm the importance of saying yes to God.y moving and will only  serve to reaffirm the importance of saying yes to God.	2000-09-06

Rachel Scott's family bravely  agreed to be interviewed on &quot;Dateline.&quot;  The anguish of this  family is too great for words.  They opened their hearts and souls to the  public about their devastating loss.  They also opened Rachel's  diaries.<br />Rachel was a deeply Christian girl who wrote poetry of an  extraordinarily high caliber.  Her poems about God, Jesus and the Holy  Spirit and how They shaped her faith are masterpieces.  This little girl,  like Ann Frank before her, unwittingly sheds light on the horrors of the  world.  Like Ann Frank, Rachel sees things in a hopeful light.  In turning  to Jesus, she reasons, many social ills will abate. In reading Rachel's  work, one can, only after her tragic death, imagine Rachel feeling  optimistic and bright in a time when she probably was exposed to the doubts  of many.  Rachel writes of her very strong beliefs and in sharing her work,  one can share some of those feelings.<br />The world was crying for Rachel.  &quot;Rachel's Tears&quot; are really the world's tears.<br />God bless  Rachel.	2000-09-06

A cyanotic baby, she screamed  incessantly.  She was an extremely active young child and seemed to be  chronically restless.<br /><br />Nancy's short life was marked by her own inner  torment, her restlessness, violence and self destructive behavior.  She had  good parents who did everything they knew possible to help their child.  By  the time Nancy was 10 in 1968-1969, she and her parents were receiving  regular treatment at a neighborhood clinic.<br /><br />One is shocked at the  callousness of clinic staff.  Deborah's therapist verbally attacked the  people in the group; Nancy's therapist appeared to be patronizing and self  serving. The director seemed especially dispicable.  He refused to provide  the Spungens with a diagonsis or even his own honest opinion.  It was stupid to say Nancy's behavior was normal when it was obviously everything  but. The Spungens obviously needed help and guidance, not dodges and  ploys.  It was also inexcusable and cruel for the staff to blame them.  That served absolutely  no real purpose whatsoever.<br /><br />One inconsistency occurs in this book during Nancy's first and most devastating breakdown at age 11.  Deborah writes that Nancy at 10 was bright eyed and functioning, but a year later Nancy's deterioration presented a thunderous contrast.  Events of 1968 and 1969 were transposed; for example Nancy, then 11 insisted on staying in NYC to see the musical \\"Hair,\\" but was reported as being aged 10.  The event took place on April 29, 1969 when Nancy was 11.  That was one alarming event that preceded one that was even more horrifying.  Shortly after disappearing into the crowd to see the musical, Nancy tried to stab a neighborhood babysitter, but was reported as being 11.  Readers can't help but think that the horrific changes in Nancy's overall behavior in 1968-69 made those years almost interchangeable in Deborah's mind.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was when Deborah overused the word begged in lieu of asked, as in, \\"David, what's wrong?\\" I begged.  \\"How?\\" I begged.  \\"Nothing?\\" I begged.  I felt using the word \\"begged\\" instead of asked in these cases stuck out like a very sore thumb.<br /><br />Like Tony Wilson of [[ASIN:0451113012 This Stranger My Son]], Nancy's deteriorating turning points took place when she was 10 and 11.  Her behavior and Tony's were not too different and their life experiences, although Tony and Nancy were roughly a decade and a half apart in age were eerily similar.  Both were the oldest children in their respective families.<br /><br />Matters reached a critical head the fall of 1969 when Nancy was 11.  She walked out of school during the first week and was subsequently  expelled. (One wonders why her therapist was so adamant that she attend  school the day in question.  From Deborah's account, Nancy was plainly in  no condition to go). She attacked her mother with a hammer when the latter refused to take her to a museum as it was near time for the place to close for the evening.  Nancy later served Thanksgiving and the Thanksgiving 1969 weekend in a hospital.  Deborah spent the months September 1969 - January 1970 finding a special needs boarding school for Nancy.<br /><br />Fortunately for the Spungens, the  Devereaux Institute accepted Nancy in February of 1970.  She made  extraordinary progress the first term there, but when she returned that fall [1970] her behavior became a litany of runaway episodes, self injurious  behavior and terrorizing her parents and siblings.  She began abusing hard drugs  during this period and sold her mother's jewelry to support her  habit.<br /><br />Nancy's behavior deteriorated in Devereaux.  Two memorable  blunders on the part of school staff was shocking.  Nancy  performed a self-abortive act at 14 even though she wasn't pregnant; cut her wrists and ran away numerous times.  School  staff suggested graduating her at age 15. Deborah insisted that the school keep Nancy another year,which enraged Nancy to the point of further self-destructive behaviors.  How could the school even consider graduation for a 15-year-old who lacked the maturity and stability for college or a regular job?  One also wonders why Devereaux refused to let the Spungens hospitalize Nancy for a month to seek a \\"vitamin treatment  program\\" in 1973.  Why would any instition bar parents from trying  different approaches to help their child?  Aren't they on the same  side?<br /><br />Nancy was graduated at age 16.  She enrolled in a college in Colorado and was expelled during the fall of 1974 for drug dealing and theft.  Devasted, Nancy  retreated into further drug use and self abuse.  Unable to control her,  Frank and Deborah arranged to have her move to Manhattan where they covered  her rent and groceries.<br /><br />Nancy spent the next year and a half clubbing and go-go dancing to make ends meet.  She was also abusing drugs.  In 1977,  Nancy decided to join her club pals in London, where she met Sid Vicious of  the Sex Pistols.  There they had a rather questionable relationship.  Sid apparently abused Nancy and on one occasion nearly severed her ear.<br /><br />During the fall of 1978, Nancy and Sid returned to the U.S.  They  stayed in the Spungeon house, where they were clearly out of their element.  Zonked and emaciated, they were clearly at the tail end of their game.  Sid appeared to be unable to participate in conversations and he spent his  time drunk and wasted with Nancy.<br /><br />The pair left for a hotel where Sid  stabbed Nancy to death with a hunting knife on October 12, 1978.  The  cruelty of the press and of entertainers about the pair's death was sickening and appalling.<br /><br />Nancy had good parents who clearly loved and cared about  her.  They got little help from the \\"experts\\" and were often left  to box shadows and fend for themselves.  Deborah's account is a loving,  gritty, heartwarming and heartfelt one; it is an entreaty to really care  about people who are obviously suffering from internal travail.<br /><br />A good companion book to this one is [[ASIN:0451113012 This Stranger My Son]]<br /><br />Each time  I read this book, I pray for the Spungens.ive behaviors.

Born to teenage parents, Cinnamon early on became a &#34;daddy's girl.&#34;  Her  parents divorced when she was small and so her time spent with her father,  David Brown was limited.<br /><br />David Brown was a ruthless, cruel, cold and  calculating sociopath.  He was married a total of six times (twice to the  same woman) and appeared to be unable to sustain adult relationships.  His  wives were put to pasture before they hit 25 and it is his wife Linda who  suffers most of all.<br /><br />David used psychological pressure on Cinnamon to  kill Linda.  Cinnamon, then 14, does so.  She is arrested and serves time  in a California Youth Authority center.  Meanwhile, David is living the  good life by marrying Linda's younger sister and making a good living in  the computer industry.<br /><br />Fortunately, David's crimes are brought to light.

Bitter over an unhappy past with a cruel and controlling father, Diane literally jumped into marriage with the  unsuspecting Stephen Downs in 1972.  That union produced two daughters and  a son.<br />Daughter Cheryl Lynn, born in 1976 was Diane's scapegoat.  Photographs of the girl reveal a somber, unsmiling face and quotes  attributed to Cheryl Lynn point out a very sad life with the demented  Diane.<br />Diane was truly demented.  She burned down the family trailer with  the idea of raising insurance money.  She wanted to start a surrogate  mother clinic and has a daughter for a couple.  (That lucky little girl  need never have to worry about having contact with Diane)!  Her lack of  ability to bond with the newborn and being able to just let her be taken by  others underscored her lack of ability to love or feel bonded to  anybody.<br />Her son and daughters knew that all too well.  In May of 1983,  Diane shot the three children in her car.  Cheryl Lynn died, Christie was  partially paralyzed and son Daniel remains paralyzed from the waist down.  Diane played &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; by Duran Duran, a song that  appeared to describe her accurately.  When Diane and her children are  rushed to the hospital, she claims a shaggy haired stranger (a classic  cliche) shot them all, herself included.  (Diane had a superficial arm  wound).<br />Her behavior during and after the shootings is disgusting, to say  the least.  She has an affair.  A daugther is born of this union and  fortunately, the child was raised by a family who refused to have any  contact with Diane who was on trial at the time of the baby's birth.  Over  the years, I have prayed for all of her surviving children and hoped that  they would have good lives.<br />Diane sang, joked and laughed during her  trial.  That behavior brought back tones and echoes of the infamous  1970-1971 Charlie Manson trials when Manson's co-defendants sang, danced  and drew pictures of Charlie during their trial.  Diane was truly  evil.<br />It is interesting to note that Diane's song of choice was the early  1980s Duran Duran hit, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf.&quot;  Like a lone Alpha  Wolf, Diane appears to hunt her prey, always choosing prey that cannot  fight her off and ends up consuming her prey.

This novel does not fail to hold the readers'  interest.<br />As sympathetic as the central adult characters Claire and Tim  are, they show a serious relationship from all angles.  We see the love,  the strong sexual attraction and lastly, the lack of judgment when they are  loud enough to awaken Tim's daughter during a romantic moment.  One cannot  help but wonder if Claire and Tim wanted to get caught, at least on a  subliminal level.  Claire seems to keep wearing the hairshirt about her  sexuality and feels it is disloyal to her children if she becomes involved  with a man other than their father.<br />Claire is an adult, she is no  longer married and therefore has no conjugal responsibility to her former  spouse.  Their relationship has changed because of this.  Tim is her lover  and as an adult who is in the prime of her life, sexually and otherwise,  there is no reason to believe that a healthy normal woman would not want to  be involved in a loving, romatic relationship with a caring partner.  That  is not implausible.  It is that very need that makes the average reader  able to identify with Claire and Tim and hope that their relationship will  work out.<br />The book is tasteful, thought provoking and extremely well  written.  It is one that will leave you with bittersweet memories and is  well worth the read.	2000-09-03

An alcoholic father, the death of her mother and the  living from brother to neighbor during her early years clearly had sad  effects in Anne Marie's life.  Gentle and trusting, she was easily  susceptible to Thomas Capano's sociopathic charms.<br />The son of a  construction baron, Thomas was the picture of wealth and power.  The idea  that this rich and powerful person took an interest in her had to be a  major ego stroke for Anne Marie.  Capano used her, took the confidences she  shared with him and used this information to Anne Marie's  detriment.<br />Other women who loved Capano romantically were similarly  mistreated.  Debby McIntyre, another gentle, hopeful woman who had been in  a bad marriage was equally susceptible to Capano's charms.  Capano's wife  also was beguiled and seduced.<br />Ann Rule does a marvelous job of detailing  the lives, chronologies and make up of the central characters.  The  portrait of the Capano men is especially chilling.  Thomas and his three  brothers appear to have no regard for women at all.  They seem to feel that  women are merely &quot;chattel&quot; and that women have no right and no  place in the business world.  Their mother appears to have set that  &quot;floor mat&quot; example by letting their father make all the  decisions and claiming to have no business knowledge.  That is sheer  irresponsibility for ANY adult not to have business savvy and it is  disgusting how the Capano men seemed to regard women.<br />This quintet of  Archie Bunkers points up the absurdity in chauvinism.  I was not sad to  learn that they had to own up to their actions in time.<br />This book is  extremely taut and well written.  It is quite riveting and one that is  unforgettable.	2000-09-03

Debora's behavior  grew even more alarming and erratic and at one point, she had to be  hospitalized.<br />Debora did not appear to have any concept of how children  and adults differed.  For example, she would confide in her oldest child,  Tim adult concerns and issues.  She would enlist Tim's support to undermine  Mike's positions.<br />Their youngest child, Kelly, appeared to have an  adult savvy into Debora's problems.  Bright and empathetic, Kelly would  make overtures to Debora when the latter was lost in a volatile rage or off  on a bizarre tangent.  A poignant display of Kelly's empathy occured when  Kelly, then 6, offered to brush Debora's hair &quot;so she would look nice  in the hospital.&quot;  Kelly was described as bright and affectionate and  seemed to be able to cope with Debora's bizarre mood swings.<br />The one  thing nobody could cope with was Debora's adultery and pyromania.

She hopes to be accepted at Berkeley. Her father, a cruel, domineering problem drinker appears to have some rather paleolithic views of women in general. He verbally and physically mistreats his wife and Tanya's younger brother and sister. He snoops in Tanya's room, roots through her drawers and reads her mail. Tanya spends as little time as she possibly can at home, preferring the company of her fat friend Cindy. Cindy is described as Tanya's opposite number. Noncerebral and not academically inclined, Cindy appears to be more interested in the dating scene and is perfectly content to remain in a community college.<br />Tanya's aspirations are much greater. She takes a cultural dance class at Berkeley where she meets a student from India named Prosenjit Poddar.<br />Poddar, an Indian native and grandson of an Untouchable sees California as the Golden Dream. He falls into an obsessive love with Tanya and demands every minute of her free time. Tanya is plainly not interested in Poddar and involves herself in a number of sporadic flings. She falls in love with a boy identified as \\"Jeff\\" in a health food store and is crushed by his refusal to see her again after they have sex; she has a relationship with a boy during the last summer of her life and becomes pregnant. Tanya does not appear to have any sexual responsibility and she does not sound like she treated other people very well. One gets the feeling that Tanya likes using Poddar and having the superior position. She appears to like manipulating Poddar by acting like the brass ring; maybe, just maybe he can win her love if he plays his cards right. Of course, this is impossible and Tanya remains out of his reach at all times.<br />Poddar's obsession takes a dangerous tone when he stalks the girl, making recordings of their conversations and even buying her an Indian sari. He demands that she go out with him and chastises her like a stern parent when she does not show up at the appointed time. His controlling attitude towards her probably reminds her of her father's controlling attitude towards women in general.<br />Her father extends that controlling philosophy towards his only son. Beaten and browbeaten too many times, Alex leaves home and takes an apartment in the Berkeley area. Poddar learns of this and rooms with Alex. Alex is described as being a lot like the father -- he is cruel, explosive and completely contemptuous of Poddar. He dangles Tanya in front of Poddar's face like a treat. If Poddar will fix his Dodge Charger, he will repay the favor by telling him about Tanya. Tanya does not like Poddar and wants him out of her life.<br />Other Indian students who room with Poddar in the International House (I-House) insist that he seek counselling. His running obsession with Tanya is frightening and alarming. They successfully get him in therapy where Poddar further reveals his obsession with the Russian-American girl.<br />He hounds Tanya by telephone, sends her gifts and waits for her at her home. Tanya's repeated entreaties that he leave her alone go unheeded. Fortunately for Tanya, she had an aunt in Brazil who had been encouraging her to visit. Tanya's parents endorsed the idea, so Tanya spent the entire summer of 1969 in Brazil. Poddar deteriorated mentally and mourned the loss of having Tanya.<br />When Tanya returns to California in early August, Poddar appears to be at least trying to put her out of his mind. His doctors are alarmed at his choosing Tanya's brother as a roommate. One wonders why Poddar disclosed that fact. That was asking for more intervention, which was sorely needed by that point.<br />Poddar never really is able to release his obsession with Tanya. He resumes following and telephoning her. When she takes her firstcourses at Berkeley that fall of 1969, Poddar is waiting for her and stalking her. Tanya has made plans to move in with her fat friend, Cindy. She voices her concerns about the stalking to Cindy and at one point tells Poddar she is not interested in him. Refusing to get the message, Poddar's obsession escalates and buys a gun to finish off his unfinished business. He kills Tanya at her home in late October of 1969.<br />In a landmark lawsuit, Tanya's parents sued Berkeley and Poddar's treating psychiatrists for failing to disclose their real concerns that he was indeed a very dangerous patient.t courses at Berkeley that fall of 1969, Poddar is waiting for her and stalking her.

It is high time somebody gave a sympathetic and well researched account of  Sharon Tate's life.  As tragic as this is, another reviewer aptly noted  that she might not have achieved the level of fame she did had she not been  killed by the Manson Family.<br />Sharon Tate was a warm, real person who had  long held out hope for securing a place in the movie world.  She did  receive plaudits for her role of the (ironically) terminally ill starlet in  1967's &quot;Valley of the Dolls.&quot;  How ironic, painful and extremely  sad that she receives star billing in death related stories (one  fictionalized, the other all too painfully real).<br />The book does not gloss  over the psychotic cruelty of the Manson Family.  It gives a gritty, hard  look at how the dementia of one truly evil man had long lasting  repercussions.<br />To his credit, the author focuses the book on Sharon.  It is a fresh, new look at the horrific events of 1969 as the attention is  rightfully turned on the unfortunate casualties of madness.	2000-09-03

Lonely, alienated and feeling rejected when Trang told her she no  longer wanted to room with her, Sinedu exacts deadly revenge.  The murder  takes place in Harvard University.<br />I had read Ms. Thernstrom's article in  &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and was very eager to see a more detailed  accounting of this tragic incident.  Ms. Thernstrom has done an outstanding  job of researching the customs and cultures of Ethiopia and Vietnam; it is  this cultural information that helps shed light on what prompted Sinedu to  act as she did.<br />The one question that came up for me was the ethics of  Sinedu's psychiatrist in discussing his patient with the author after she  died.  Maybe it is not unethical to discuss deceased patients.  That is  never explained in the book.  It would have been good information to have  since the author criticizes the university for its woefully inadequate  treatment and recognition of dangerously mentally ill students.<br />This book  is a social service.  It is an alarm clock waking up the world at large by  ringing out the message that it is TIME to act, it is TIME to use mental  health services when available and it is TIME to stop pointing fingers of  blame.  If nothing else, I hope people came away having learned something  after reading this book.	2000-09-03

I WISH EVERYBODY THOUGHT LIKE ALFIE KOHN!	I have stated in a previous review how I feel about prizes/awards and the  punitive tone I feel often accompany them.<br />In 1965 the Queen of England  presented the Beatles with the MBE Award.  John Lennon refused his and some  several years later, returned it to the Queen.  He felt that he could not,  in good conscience accept an award that had previously been given to people  who had killed others in combat.<br />I was so impressed by John Lennon's  brave stand against the award.  It showed a real strength of character and  convictions and it showed not compromising one's standards.  I even cheered  John's stand on this and his refusal of the award.<br />In my earlier review,  I criticized what I call &quot;lollipop&quot; awards.  Lollipops are simply  uniform prizes given to all participants.  I hate the lollipops because  they are patronizing and insulting.  The message contained therein is,  &quot;Don't count on being able to earn a real prize.  Just be content with  a lollipop.&quot;  I could never, at any point in my life accept a  &quot;lollipop.&quot;  The three times I received &quot;lollipops&quot; as  a child were three occasions those lollipops were promptly disposed of.  I  remember even then consciously thinking that &quot;if I don't get a REAL  prize fairly, then I won't get one.&quot;  I just could not accept a  lollipop.  Receiving such an ersatz prize can really hurt one's pride and  undermine confidence.  Although lollipops are usually dispensed with good  intentions, it often backfires.<br />John Lennon set a good example.  He did  not accept something he did not feel he earned.<br />I like the way the  author brings home the point that people are NOT a series of conditioned  responses.  Behaviorism is very restrictive and very limiting in addressing  human responses and issues.  Alfie Kohn has done a tremendous service in  his presentations of this lesson and his arguments are right on target.<br />I  wish everybody agreed with Alfie Kohn's position.  This book is one I would  highly recommend to anyone.  It is well worth reading.n's position.  This book is one I would  highly recommend to anyone.  It is well worth reading.	2000-09-03

Rosa is a spirited little dog who looks mostly like an anvil headed English bull terrier.

When Rosa swallows one of her rubber squeaky toys, her  owner has her admitted to a pet hospital where the dog undergoes surgery to  remove the rubber toy.<br />Hospitals are frightening places for anybody of  any age.  To her credit, the author helps keep some of that fear at bay by  having a dog patient as opposed to a human patient.  Using this distancing  technique makes it easier to laugh at the notion of a pet hospital (such  places do exist) and cheer for the recovery of the avaricious little dog.	2000-09-03

Pat Allenson was undoubtably a sociopath. No two ways about it. From a child she exhibited demanding, ruthless behavior. Her maternal grandmother adored her and placed Pat's interests and needs over her own large brood. Pat was indulged to the point of excess.<br />When Pat was 5, her mother married a career army officer named Clifford Radcliffe. Pat, resentful of having to leave the charmed life her grandmother gave her and share any part of the limelight with her half-brother, Kent, was forced to move out of state and move into a new lifestyle.<br />In true sociopathic form, Pat, like the proverbial rat, could survive just about anywhere. Radcliffe's career took the family to different countries where they were warmly received. Pat, blessed with physical attractiveness, used this to charm people into indulging her.<br />Kent, on the other hand was a gentle, mild mannered boy. A hearing loss in infancy appeared to exacerbate his shyness. He was easily eclipsed and dominated by his bullying sister. Never able to find peace with himself, he committed suicide in 1966.<br />Pat married at age 15 and had three children. Like her mother, she married a career officer whose assignments led to distant travel. Pat's oldest child Susan remembers that when she was 4, Pat crushed her hand while the family was in the Phillippines. This incident seemed to set the tone for Susan's future relationship with Pat. She did not want to see Pat when her hand was injured and this sentiment seemed to remain consistent throughout their lives together.<br />Pat's middle child, Debbie, appeared to be her mother's daughter. A child bride, Debbie would later embark on a series of affairs, become involved in prostitution and work with Pat in drugging and robbing elderly patients.<br />Ron, Pat's youngest child seemed most like his uncle Kent. Never able to find his place, he became a drifter and had a series of unsatisfactory relationships. In 1980 he eventually had a daughter named Ashlynne who was the apple of Pat's mother's eye.<br />History repeated itself. Pat's maternal grandmother adored her. Ashlynne's maternal grandmother adored her. Pat resented her mother lavishing love on Ashlynne. To compensate for this, she showered gifts upon Susan's children. A Southern Belle wannabe, Pat remarried a very gentle man named Tom Allenson. They had a \\"Gone With the Wind\\" themed wedding and Tom appeared to care very deeply about his new wife. He, too, had some disastrous marriages and was crushed at having no way to contact his children.<br />Pat, ever the seductress, devised newer and more frightening methods to command center stage. A possible victim of \\"Munchausen's Syndrome,\\" she inflicted deep wounds on her body, reinfected one to the point she had to be hospitalized and sought ways to make people care about her. She resented the attention and time her grandchildren required and saw them as intrusions. She was especially antagonistic towards Ashlynne.<br />Pat was a ruthless sociopath who would stop at nothing to secure her goal. Susan's third child, Adam, was seen as a threat by Pat. She extended the hostility she felt for Ashlynne to Adam. She kept Susan drugged and poisoned and refused to let Susan have Adam. She insisted on keeping the mother and child apart, knowing full well how miserable she was making them.<br />Susan finally recovers and bravely blows the whistle on Pat. Having served jail time for a previous murder attempt, Pat once again entered the system.

She teams up with the lover, his friend and a lonely,  overweight girl who has not found her niche among her peers.<br />Suzanne  did some incredibly stupid things.  For example, she videotapes the kids  hanging out at her house after her husband is killed; she has sex with the  young boy while the girl waits downstairs.

As a child she is afraid of toast, bread crusts and has an array of bizarre verbal expressions.  A veteran of  clinics and later, hospitals and psychotropic medicines, Lonnie appears to  accept her mental condition from the start.  Her oddities stand out in  stark contrast to her younger sister.<br />Lonnie's sister narrates the  story of their voyage into mental illness, one as the unwilling passenger  and the other as the conductor, trying to make sense out of a bizarre  existence.<br />Lonnie exhibits glaringly masculine behaviors from an early  age.  She sneers at her little sister, dismissing her as a &quot;prissy  pink princess&quot; and has no use for dolls, dresses or anything even  remotely approaching gender bias towards feminity.  When she is  hospitalized during her early puberty, she pretends to like dresses so she  can convince her parents to have her released.<br />Never able to comfortably  find her niche, Lonnie's verbalizations and behaviors grow alarmingly more  bizarre.  Her parents split up and her younger sister fights for her own  independence.  Lonnie seems to accept her mental condition, e.g., she says  upon seeing her little sister enter high school, she admits that she,  Lonnie, can't go to high school.  She crops her hair, adopts glaringly  masculine appearing behaviors and, at the close of the book, is living a  lesbian lifestyle in a half way house.<br />Lonnie's sister provides the voice  of reason, the voice of explanation and the voice of hope.  She holds out  hope for Lonnie by describing her originality and spark of creativity and  humor.  She sticks by Lonnie.  During the turbulent 1960s, during which a  good portion of this story takes place, she points out Lonnie's behavior is  not too outlandish given the climate of their times.<br />This novel gives a  gentle, humane look at how mental illness affects an entire family and not  just the person unfortunate enough to have the condition.	2000-09-02

Fluent in several languages and able to navigate his way throughout Europe and Asia, he remained an  enigmatic figure and certainly one of the most interesting.  He has been  regarded as the worst serial killer in Asian history.<br />Sobraj was an out  of wedlock child born to a young Vietnamese mother and Indian father.  Rejected by his natural father and only minimally accepted by his natural  mother, Charles showed problems at a very early age.  A sleep wetter until  his early teens, Charles showed a calculated, vicious side almost from an  infant. He would cut his mother's dresses to shreds so she could not go out  at night; he learned early to fend for himself with a group of street  children; he had no respect for authority figures and used foul language.  When Sobraj's mother remarries, she takes Charles' younger sister (they  were full siblings) and leaves Charles with his reluctant father.  Sobraj,  Sr., now remarried and well stocked with mistresses has provided Charles  with a passel of Indian and Indio-Asian half siblings.

Feeling displaced, Charles is left  to try to sort out his sibling relationships.  As the oldest of his French  half-siblings, he exudes an aura of mystery and the younger children adore  him.  He would, years later, repay their adoration by stealing from them  and in one memorable instance, framing a younger brother for a crime that  he, Charles had committed.<br />In adult life, Charles distinguishes himself  as being able to move and blend into the culture of whichever country he is  in.

Speech  was the major milestone that Georgiana did not make during her early  years.<br /><br />Georgie's mother had many overwhelming issues -- Georgie's unusual  aversion for any type of sound, music included and Dotsy's being  diagnosed with leukemia in 1967 when she was 4.<br /><br />Annabelle naturally has Georgie  tested and sent to early intervention programs.  The only place where  Georgie appeared to thrive was at Bellevue Hospital because, as Georgie  herself said many years later, \\"it was quiet there.\\"  Dotsy's  health deteriorates and she dies at the age of 8 in 1971.  Georgie, then 6,  is sent to a residential facility identified only as  \\"Childville.\\"<br /><br />\\"Childville\\" sounds like a genuine  Chamber of Horrors.  Georgie complains about the noise and staff dismiss  her complaints.  She is overmedicated and complains that the medicines make  her feel funny.  She becomes hostile and acts out because she cannot stand  any type of sound.  A rather incompetent social worker identified as  \\"Judith\\" seems determined to block and undermine any and all  progress on Georgie's part.  When the girl shows an unusual balancing  ability and begs for a skateboard, Judith refuses, telling Georgie's mother  that Georgie is \\"overcompensating a fear.\\"  Fortunately, Georgie  gets her skateboard and is quite proficient on it.<br /><br />Georgie is fortunate  enough to have summers free of that institutional wasteland.  Luckily for  all, Annabelle marries Peter and that union produces a natural brother and  later a sister for Georgie.  Peter has some grown daughters from a previous  marriage and it is in this loving, extended family that Georgie  blossoms.<br /><br />Annabelle decides that Childville is not the answer and  withdraws Georgie when the girl was 11.  Peter had accepted a job in  Switzerland, and naturally Georgie wanted to join her family.  Judith tries  to keep Annabelle and Peter from withdrawing Georgie, invoking the name of  and cliches from Freud.  Fortunately, Annabelle withdraws Georgie,  discontinues the medications and for the next several years, Georgie  flourishes in Switzerland.  She learns to ski, is mainstreamed and explains  her aversion to sound.  Luckily, she has been treated by several very  humane doctors specially trained in AIT (Auditory Integration Therapy) and  this treatment is continued during her years abroad.  One can't help but  cheer when Georgie dances in the rain, explaining that the rain  \\"doesn't sound like a machine gun anymore.\\"<br /><br />An interesting  expression that Annabelle coined is \\"hig,\\" meaning \\"hostile  inadvertent gesture.\\"  One can't help wondering why it isn't  \\"hostile INTENTIONAL gesture\\" because Georgie would sometimes  deliberately inflict physical pain on people who had crossed her.  Annabelle devised the acronym \\"hig\\" to subtly call Georgie on her  behavior in these instances.<br /><br />After several years abroad, the family  returns to the U.S.  Georgie's records \\"mysteriously disappear\\"  because the cruise ship she was on met with a disaster and several cartons  had to be discarded.<br /><br />Free of previous baggage, Georgie attends a public  school in Connecticut.  She graduates as class valedictorian in 1984 and,  at last count, is happily married.<br /><br />Georgie appeared on \\"Sally  Jesse Raphael\\" in 1992 and drew a map of Africa, all countries  included from memory.  Bright and now quite verbal, Georgie is a strong  advocate of AIT.  She said it literally saved her life.<br /><br />She is now fluent in 6 languages including Arabic; is a gifted artist and very spiritual. Georgie is also an author. She has chronicled her life story in \\"Overcoming Autism,\\" in which she promises readers that upon reading her book they will have a very clear understanding of what it means to have autism.

At 10, she  undergoes surgery and follow-up treatments to remove a cancerous jaw.  This  unfortunately alters her appearance and Lucy  has to live with the hostile  stares, cruel comments and stupid remarks made by insensitive  people.<br />Although Lucy uses the word &quot;disabled,&quot; it is the  opinion of this reviewer that Lucy was disabled in ACTION.  As unfortunate  as her health and appearance altering condition is, Lucy remains true to  her core self.  Bright, witty and extremely verbal, Lucy reminds the world  at large of how character all too often is eclipsed by appearance.  Lucy  also inadvertently reminds all who have read this book that  &quot;able&quot; is the core part of &quot;disable&quot; and that  &quot;dis&quot; is simply a prefix.  Therefore, she is more ABLE that  disabled.  That is a very affirming thought.<br />Lucy is truly an inspiration  and gives a good reminder to ALL persons never to judge somebody based on  physical appearance.  In this book, Lucy is truly beautiful.	2000-09-01

I was one of the countless hordes of children who grew up on the Brady  Bunch. I still remember reserving Friday nights at 8:00 p.m. EST, channel 7  (ABC) and looking forward to the next installment of the Baby Boomer's  favorite TV family.<br />Barry Williams' book is a real treat.  He first  describes his interest in acting from an early age and the doors that were  opened to allow him to pursue his dream.  I loved Barry's behind the scenes  descriptions of the auditioning for the parts and the ultimate selection of  the cast.<br />Barry has a wonderful, evilly delicious gift for satire.  I  love it!  On just about every page, Barry has a very logical point couched  in satirical terms.  For example, he challenges the absurdity of a 1970  episode where a visiting doctor diagnoses Cindy with tonsillitis simply  because she sneezed.  He also points out the illogic in many episodes that  viewers were happily oblivious to during the 1969-1974 Brady years.<br />Barry provides very interesting portraits of his fellow cast and  creators of the show.  His &quot;glimpse behind the curtain&quot; makes for  some very interesting AND very funny accounts!  I love the inclusion of  actor Robert Reed's scathing memos.  Articulate and well versed, Reed makes  no pretense of liking the show in his writings.  Since he felt so strongly  against the show, it is ironic that he plays his role of Brady patriarch so  well.  Too well, in fact.  I recently saw on &quot;Time and Again&quot;  (msNBC) a profile of the creation and the staying power of &quot;The Brady  Bunch&quot; and one woman was identified as a &quot;Bradyologist.&quot;  The show has even added to our lexicon!	2000-09-01

Fern Kupfer writes with a clear, clean,  crisp and very direct style that is sure to reach all readers.<br />In more  recent years, her severely developmentally delayed son's progress has been  updated in this book.  It made the reader feel somewhat bonded to the  Kupfers (Fern Kupfer has written some delightful fictional stories that  have appeared in &quot;Redbook&quot; and other magazines) and all the more  interested in the approaches used to teach and raise this perpetual  infant.<br />Zachariah's older sister, Gabi, provides comic relief.  Bright  and verbal, Gabi possesses a savvy that shows up at a very early age.  Wonderfully original, Gabi is never at a loss to express herself and her  mixed feelings about her brother.  One does sense that Gabi feels a real  loss.  Her brother is on the developmental plane of an infant and most  likely will remain an infant for the rest of his life.  She is funny,  lovable and unflinchingly honest in her assessments.  It is through Gabi  that one gets an even clearer picture of life with a loved one who is  severely developmentally delayed.<br />Some years have passed since the latest  update on Zachariah's progress.  The residential program in Iowa where we  last checked in with Zachariah sounded like a wonderfully humane place and  one where persons living as perpetual infants got good, loving care and  full protection.	2000-09-01

I didn't like the trite formulaic romances like &quot;Fine Things&quot; or the ones about couples  dealing with family/pregnancy issues.  Those stories always seemed like  &quot;cookie cutter&quot; formats and often I didn't like the characters.  I remember a recent book about a highpowered doctor and attorney couple who  battle incessantly over her refusal to have kids because of her career as  being a spectacular disappointment.  I disliked that book and everyone in  it.<br />This book is a refreshing change of pace.  Richly drawn,  sympathetic, easily recognizable characters and a believable story.  Liz  and Jack Sutherland, both lawyers are blessed with 5 children, ranging from  9 to 18.  Jack is killed by an irate client and Liz is left to cope with  her officious mother, her loving housekeeper and her five children.<br />They  band together admirably.  Liz holds down the fort, changes branches of  legal specialty and spends more time than ever with her children.  She  coaches her youngest son Jamie in Special Olympics where he wins his first  prize.  She and her family take trips together.  They talk openly about  Jack and use their time wisely to heal.  When her oldest child, Peter, is  injured in a diving accident, Liz literally walks into romance with the  attendding physician.  After some requisite ups and downs and bumpy roads,  they have been cleared for take off.<br />Jamie, at 9 and mildly retarded,  takes to the new man in Liz' life and when he breaks his arm, it is the  knight in white surgical scrubs who comes through yet again.<br />I actually  liked this book.  It was a pleasant departure from the formulaic style and  I liked the characters.  The writing style was crisp, fresh and held one's  interest.	2000-08-30

She  radiated class, elegance, poise and style.  From all accounts, Jackie was  an excellent mother and the successes of her children and their loving  accounts of her is proof positive of her success.  One gets the feeling  that Jackie felt somewhat out of place among the more boisterous members of  the extended family.  For all of her fierce independence, there is a  poignancy about her.  Jackie was a woman who commanded respect.<br />Joan, a  gentle, self effacing woman had some overwhelming challenges of her own.  An alcholic mother, her own drinking problem and her oldest son Ted, Jr.'s  leg amputation at age 12 appeared to hit her all at once. Demure and  loving, Joan relates how she told Ted Jr. he could let his feelings out; he  was a child, not a man and losing a body part at any age was traumatic.  Joan insists on marching to her own drummer and her drummer plays a very  poignant tune.  Daughter Kara goes through a rebellious stage and youngest  son Patrick (now a representative) has been treated for depression.  Joan  is crushed by Ted Sr.'s adulterous affairs and their combination of  problems ultimately ends in divorce.  For the first time in her life, Joan  is forced to confront herself and decide on the tune her drummer will play.  She is a very sympathetic person and one can only keep hoping and praying  she will find peace.<br />Ethel is wonderfully gregarious, funny and outgoing.  She is Jackie's opposite number in that she is perfectly comfortable in  expressing herself without restraint.  Known for her love of spontaneous  practical jokes, Ethel distinguishes herself within the large clan.  An  accomplished equestrienne, Ethel appears to derive equal satisfaction in  aggressive touch football games and tennis matches.  She has a wonderfully  zany side that brings a smile to the face as her antics are recounted.  She  also appears to be a good counterpart to Robert Kennedy; the serious,  sometimes brooding Attorney General/Senator has these characteristics  balanced by the irrepressible Ethel.<br />Ethel, too, has her share of  hardships.

Mr. Kohn presents an excellent argument against the &quot;carrot and  stick&quot; methods traditionally found in behaviorism.  In fact, he  appears to challenge the entire philosophy and behaviorist approaches  because humans are not just a set of conditioned responses.  Mr. Kohn's  argument appears to be focused on helping people develop an intrinsic gauge  to determine and develop their own standards and to take pride in what they  are reasonably able to accomplish.<br />Mr. Kohn's theory is well-researched  and is for me, 100% believable.  His use of language and examples are  effective in communicating his message.  He appears to have a genuine  sympathy for humankind in general and seems to feel that people will do  their best provided they are encourged to do so for their own growth and  development and not at the expense of others.<br />I have always believed that  COMPETITION KILLS COOPERATION and that creating rivalry among people often  undermines the outcome in the long run.<br />Dispensing what I call  &quot;lollipop&quot; awards, that is, uniform awards given to all  participants is wasteful.  Nobody's performance is being distinguished, so  therefore an award is asinine and meaningless.  Although  &quot;lollipops&quot; are awarded with the best of good intentions, they  are unrealistic.  They fly in the face of what awards really stand for --  noting exceptional performance.  Lollipops are not a panacea for one's  basic desire to do well and be recognized for an outstanding performance.  No playing field can ever be level and merely passing out  &quot;lollipops&quot; is patronizing and insulting.  I, for one, abhor  &quot;lollipops&quot; and I could never accept such an award/prize in good  conscience.  For me, it has to be earned/won fairly and honestly or it just  doesn't count.  It has to be a REAL award that was justly earned.<br />I have  always wished that prizes and awards would cease to exist.  All they do is  breed rivalry and negative competition.  I feel they often undermine  cooperation and in many cases preclude cooperation or motivation.  I  personally find my motivation plummet at the mere mention of prizes.  Prizes make me not want to perform because of the negative competition  involved.<br />Mr. Kohn does an excellent job of defining the  &quot;intrinsic&quot; rewards.  Such inner gauges allow a person to feel  good about their accomplishments and receiving positive feedback is always  a critical element.  My favorite uncle was a master at intrinsic rewards --  just knowing he felt you had done a good job was a major ego booster.  His  method was one of gentle encouragement and his philosophy was that if one  expects the best, then on can reasonably believe that they will get the  results they want.  My uncle did not dispense any awards and he had a very  strong sense of self and ethics.  This highly gifted man has imparted a  REAL gift -- the gift of hard work and taking pride in it.<br />This book is  an excellent statement to the above.

Her older brother Daniel, a brilliant boy,  showed signs of psychosis in early adulthood.  He somehow managed to attend  Harvard and upon leaving the renowned university, succumbs to his illness.  He marries a woman from his halfway house and they have a daughter.  The  brother commits suicide and the baby remains unheard from.  Clea was in  college at the time of her brother's death and her parents curiously give  her a false account of how her brother killed himself.  That is never  explained.<br /><br />Clea's sister Katherine/Althea appears to be the most unstable.  She,  too, started showing signs of the illness in late adolescence and was  barely able to fight her psychosis and finish high school.  She lived from  hospital to halfway house, never really finding her niche.  Her erratic  behavior precluded her from staying at halfway houses and in one memorable  account in the book, a landlady requested that her parents come and collect  her after she defecated on a mattress.  She remained a  \\"living\\" casualty of mental illness; at the close of the book,  Clea did not even know where she was.<br /><br />Clea is a strong voice, a strong  advocate for the families of the mentally ill.

Like a prism,  the mind refracts information (as a prism does light) into distorted  processes during an active phase of psychosis.  One can almost imagine the  many facets of this illness as it is so individual; &quot;Sylvia  Frumkin's&quot; chronic battle with psychosis is told with a touch of  humor.<br />The author follows this actively psychotic woman for a 17 year  time frame.  Sylvia's first onset with the illness took place in 1964.  Mentally distorted and confused, Sylvia's life is spent in and out of  hospitals and treatment centers.<br />As devasting and tragic as mental  illness is, the author injects notes of levity into some of Sylvia's more  outlandish behavior.  This softens the stark reality of Sylvia's illness  and offers a lighter side to a very dark illness.  It is hard not to smile  when Sylvia declares herself to be Paul McCartney's wife.  It is also hard  not to smile when Sylvia explains in great detail why her delusions are  justified and grounded.  The incongruity of reality and Sylvia's delusions  provide an almost light touch of ironic contrast.  This tone is very  effective in presenting Sylvia in a very humane and sympathetic light.  It  also helps readers (and hopefully others) feel affection for, and hope for  the &quot;Sylvias&quot; who need a chance and people who genuinely care  about them.	2000-08-28

Prior to the accounts  of &#34;Eve&#34; (Chris Sizemore, the world's most famous person to have  survived with this disorder) many misperceptions  about the illness were touted as fact.  For example, many experts  discounted the existence of multiple personality disorder and often saw it  as a form of malingering.<br /><br />Dr. Cornelia Wilbur, who died in 1994 made  psychiatric history with Sybil.  In fact they used one another to reach psycho-literary fame in this fictitious account of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).  In this novel, together they work to pierce the  &#34;Clock Incomprehensible,&#34; fugue states where Sybil cannot account  for her whereabouts or actions.  During their several years of hard work  together, doctor and patient uncover a total of 16 separate and distinct  personalities. Born in 1923, Sybil's various &#34;selves&#34; were  &#34;born&#34; over 20-year time span, from 1926 to 1946. Vanessa is the  only personality who is able to play the piano.  Mike and Sid are her male  personalities.  Vicky is her cosmopolitan, cultured personality.  Vicky and  Vanessa appear to be the most appealing personalities and all 16 were  created to cope with Sybil's allegedly psychotic mother.<br /><br />According to Shreiber and Wilbur, &#34;Hattie,&#34; Sybil's mother was described as being angry and dangerously  mentally ill.  They gave her a history of sexually abusing children.  In this book, Sybil remembered seeing the mother naked and bouncing a naked neighbor's baby boy between her legs.  The mother would also defecate on neighborhood lawns.  She reportedly inserted objects into Sybil's body almost from the time Sybil was an  infant; she forced the girl to drink laxatives and refused to let her  release solid waste; she suspended her from the ceiling; she choked her;  left her in a corn crib to smother; beat her with an array of sundry  objects and permanently scarred her body with a button hook.  Sybil's  father appears to be singularly ineffectual; he dodges the mother and years  later claims to have had no knowledge of the woman's extreme cruelty.  Again, this is from the telling in this book.<br /><br />Sybil's acceptance of the personalities takes time as well.  Dr. Wilbur uses hypnosis to fuse the personalities and after several hypnotherapy  sessions, Sybil agrees to accept all of the personalities and their  abilities be merged into one, herself.  By 1965 Sybil is an  &#34;integrated&#34; unit.  That is how this fraudulent account of DID is neatly summed up in this book.<br /><br />ETA: However, Sybil has since been exposed as a fraud.  The real &#34;Sybil&#34; (Shirley A. Mason), Dr. Wilbur and Ms. Schreiber all profited from manufacturing a woman with DID and crafting a childhood replete with maternal abuse.  Debbie Nathan's excellent book, [[ASIN:B004T4KQXY Sybil Exposed]] blows the smoke and mirrors of deception away to reveal a tripartite fraud: Dr. Wilbur, Ms. Schreiber and Sybil herself.  This book and the 1976 and 2008 movies have reinforced a fraud that had been in the works since Ms. Mason entered treatment with Dr. Wilbur in the 1950s.  Over time and with the involvement of an author, the manufacturing of these resulting &#34;personalities&#34; and the false memories were well underway, with Dr. Wilbur aiming for fame and recognition and book deals.<br /><br />A gifted artist, Sybil drew and painted.  In the book, her manufactured &#34;alters&#34; were credited for being artists.  Sybil was living in Kentucky during her later years and when she died, the man who bought and moved into her house found her artwork and discovered and uncovered her identity.  As another reviewer on Amazon's US boards posted is right - read this book as a cautionary tale.  This book is just a fraudulent claim.  James Frey, anyone?  The real Sybil died in 1998 and her  profession was listed as &#34;artist.&#34;  Again, you will want to read Debbie Nathan's book, [[ASIN:B004T4KQXY Sybil Exposed]].Debbie Nathan's book, [[ASIN:B004T4KQXY Sybil Exposed]].	2000-08-28

At each stop she wonders what place exists for her and her child.<br /><br />This author provides a calming voice of reason to  Crystal's plight.  To her credit, she does not villify or condemn even the  harshest of people and conditions.  She writes in a tone of respect and  even acceptance.  If nothing else, this book is a reminder of each person's  duty to care about the needs of others.	2000-08-28

The classic  middle child, Janie is overlooked by her older siblings and her baby  brother Timmy is everybody's darling.  Naive, immature and a little silly,  Janie is often given to flights of fancy.  This unfortunately has hurt her  credibility.<br />Janie's godmother takes a keen interest in the girl.  Sympathizing with &quot;Middle Child Syndrome,&quot; the girl's godmother  invests in some island property which she gives to Janie.  Delighted, Janie  rushes home to tell her parents that she now &quot;owns an island.&quot;  Nobody believes her until her godmother defends her and reminds other  relatives of times when THEY &quot;embroidered&quot; the truth.  Janie's  credibility is restored and all is well until she meets a new peer named  Lisa.<br />Lisa is a sneaky, mean and a complete phony. The classic &quot;poor  little rich girl,&quot; she invites Janie and another girl to her home.  She stands the guests up and it is to her godmother's credit that she  suggests to Lisa's guardian not to tell her that the girls came while their  host was absent.<br />Lisa lies like a rug.  She tells other kids that her  father is a famous musician and whenever a particular song comes on the  radio, she claims it is his composition.  When Janie asks her older brother  about it, he scoffs and tells her who the REAL artists are.  Once again,  nasty Lisa is caught in a lie.<br />The conflict is finally resolved when  Janie's godmother invites Lisa and Pam (the child who was also stood up) to  the island she bought.  Janie and Pam form an alliance and for once Lisa is  left to fend for herself.  She is exposed to the light of day and Janie  matures somewhat.	2000-08-27

They had it ghostwritten and whoever their ghostwriter is has a poor command of  language.  The sentence structure is weak and as a reader from Huntsville  noted, the book is chock full of run on sentences.<br />It is cruel to  ridicule any place as somebody will always be offended.  Huntsville is the  home of NASA and is a very up to the minute high tech engineering  mecca.<br />This book only has flattering pictures of the girls to recommend  it.  The book is yet another cranked out money maker for those who have a  monetary interest in the Olsen girls.  As beautiful and talented as these  girls are, they did not create the &quot;Dual Star&quot; enterprise or any  of the sundry money making machines to which they have been enslaved since  infancy.  This is just another way to market the girls for financial  gain.<br />Oh, pu-leeeeease!	2000-08-27

Set in 1939-40, Anna Solden, the central character in \\"From Anna,\\" makes a reappearance in this book. Anna, now 15 is in high school. It is the height of the Second World War and Anna has outgrown her Sight Savers class and has entered high school. Unfortunately, her good friend Isobel who stuck by her throughout their elementary school years together attends a different school.<br /><br />Anna's life has certainly improved since her early days in Canada. Her Sight Savers teacher has married her (Anna's) doctor and they have named their daughter after Anna. Anna finally connects with the redoubtable oldest brother Rudi after Rudi is blinded in an accident while serving active duty. (As Germans in Canada, the Soldens face all kinds of discrimination because of the anti-German sentiments that stemmed from the Holocaust atrocities). This gently written, beautiful book helps remind folks that prejudice of any kind does not work and only exacerbates existing problems. Rudi tries to prove that point by serving in the Allied Forces. Once he is blinded and shipped home, it is Anna who nurses him back to health.<br /><br />She reminds him of how his cruel taunting of her during her early years hurt her to the point of retreat; she reminds him that his cruel nickname for her (\\"Awkward Anna\\") was a painful memory she'll never be able to shed. She forces Rudi to confront his newly altered lifestyle; she forces him to learn Braille and to work with their father in the store. Anna encourages and reinforces Rudi every step of the way and literally forces her brother out of his self-imposed shell. During the Braille sessions, Anna learns alongside of Rudi because of her own very low vision.<br /><br />Near the close of the story, Anna said when birds were out she would \\"listen for the singing,\\" even if she couldn't see them. What a positive and affirming life statement! I found myself using that very same expression from time to time. Anna is truly a classic character and one who will remain part of one's heart.

I really liked this installment.  Jessi, the narrator describes Kwanzaa, the African holiday and the history and traditions about Kwanzaa.<br />Jessi's redoubtable Aunt Cecilia is just as overly punitive as ever,  until her father intervenes and reminds her that as long as she is living  in HIS house, she will have to abide by HIS rules and not try to enforce  her own.  He defends his children and reminds his sister yet again that  Jessi and her 8-year-old sister are still children and to cut them some  slack.  Chastened, the girls' aunt vows to do an about face and once again  takes them Christmas shopping.  Instead of chewing them out for being  hungry or clowing around, the aunt bites her tongue.  The only thing I had  trouble with was her allowing the girls' baby brother to ride outside of  his car seat when he becomes restless and fussy.<br />Unfortunately, they are  involved in an accident and Squirt (John, Jr.) has to be hospitalized.  Distraught over the baby's injuries, the parents chew the aunt out for her  sheer irresponsibility (why would any ADULT allow a baby to ride in a car  without being properly harnessed)?  The Kwanzaa gatherings with other  members of Jessi's family are strained and everybody is up in arms over the  harm done to poor Squirt.<br />The subplot is excellent.  Ann Martin has a  real gift for creating dialog and scenes.  The other members of the BSC  plan a Kwanzaa skit and the BSCers and charges alike all get into the  spirit of Kwanzaa and actually learn a few things.  I laughed at the  hilarious story of Malindy's Soul, the story the group put on.  It was a  delightful farce and really quite well woven into the story.<br />Fortunately,  Squirt recovers and everybody has a wonderful holiday.  Instead of Santa,  everybody follows the Kwanzaa celebration.  This book is really good.	2000-08-26

This is truly the best book featuring a character with cerebral palsy.  Sarah (Sally) is the central character in this story.  At 9, she has  attended a school for children with physical challenges for the past five  years.  The Canadian province she lives in has no such school, so her  parents arrange to have her admitted to the school in America.<br />Finally, a  rehab center opens in her town.  Sally's parents move closer to the center  so Sally can live at home.  Her father flies her back and works like a  soldier helping Sally to feel integrated into her rather large  family.<br />Sally has an older, bossy sister named Mindy, a brother close in  age named Kent and a sister in kindergarten named Meg.  She gets to know  Meg because Meg was the sibling she spent the least amount of time with due  to her years in America.<br />Sally's father is truly a rare gem.  He is  clearly a very intelligent and articulate man and he provides intelligent  explanations for things.  For example, when Sally, understandably fearful  of starting out in public school asks why she was sent out of the country  in the first place, her mother flares up.  That was needless.  Sally needed  sympathy and a good explanation, which her father provided.  He told her  that at Meg's age, Sally could neither speak clearly nor feed herself; she  could not walk; she could not dress herself.  He summed it up nicely by  saying that he thought she would want to do these things for herself.  He  was truly a delightful character.<br />Once enrolled in public school, Sally  makes friends with classmates Jon and Elsje Jansen and another girl who  immediately takes her under her wing.  Sally learns that Elsje's brother  Pieter had a heart condition that precluded him from attending school for a  year.  Nursed at home, Pieter nurses a grudge against his illness and  insists on only speaking Dutch, thus further isolating himself.  It is  Sally, his sister and his friends who get Pieter to leave his self-imposed  shell to help them with their dog training project.<br />This is a wonderful  book that I have loved since I was a little girl.

As one reviewer aptly noted, was their  &quot;feud&quot; really one that defined the 1960s?  That point is  questionable at best, doubtful at worst.  The very position these men  occupied during that period (Attorney General and later Senator/President  respectively) certainly does command the world's interest and  attention.<br />Both men are drawn in stark relief to each other. One point I  think is worth mentioning is that they really did have a lot in common.  Both men were very bright, very aggressive and very determined.  Both men  had strong convictions and personalities to match.  As has been duly  recorded over time, one major point of contention was the Vietnam  War.<br />I agree with one reviewer who questioned the harsh description of  Johnson's character.  I happen to believe that Johnson was a good,  effective administrator.  As for the Vietnam War, he inherited that  headache and as an unfortunate consequence, followed bad advice about that  war instead of bailing out sooner.  RFK seemed to feel LBJ was wholly  responsible for the war escalation.  He neglected to note in his arguments  and criticisms of President Johnson that the Vietnam conflict began in the  late 1950s! (ca 1957, under Eisenhower's administation).  During President  Kennedy's tenure in office, the Vietnam conflict was well underway, but it  is interesting to note that this author does not really point out that  fact.<br />In this reading, one gets the feeling that Robert Kennedy was  still working to protect the interest and reputation of his late brother.  Since President Johnson assumed office after President Kennedy's death, one  could sympathize with the Attorney General's resentment of anyone assuming  that office.<br />The whole description of the &quot;feud&quot; is really a  clashing of ideologies; it is really the parting of ways over issues.  This  author, to his credit does a thorough job in researching this subject and  portrays historical events accurately.<br />It is hoped that in time, the  general perception of LBJ will be softened; LBJ was by far and away the  most progressive administrator on domestic issues since FDR.  LBJ had more  bills enacted during his tenure in office than any other president to date.  He took a strong stand on environmental, education and civil rights issues  that have positive impacts to this day.  He was the president who  negotiated and succeeded in securing public/subsidized housing, Head Start  programs for underprivileged school children; MediCaid/MediCare and the  1965 Voters' Rights Acts which have today a positive impact on the large  number of minorities who vote today.  It is the opinion of this reviewer  that President Johnson was a good and decent man whose many bills, budgets  and proposals have had many positive impacts on the world as we now know  it.<br />Robert Kennedy, the tireless worker who actively became involved in  Civil Rights after the death of his brother, provided a parallel view of  the work Johnson was already immersed in.  Both men shared a vision and a  quest for a better world with more advantages extended to all persons and  with the rights of all persons more fully protected and enacted.<br />Robert  Kennedy was in many ways not too different from President Johnson in  objectives.oes a thorough job in researching this subject and  portrays historical events accurately.<br />It is hoped that in time, the  general perception of LBJ will be softened; LBJ was by far and away the  most progressive administrator on domestic issues since FDR.

This work is sheer brilliance.  Mr. Kohn makes a very good and very  unshakable case against dispensing awards.  I have long believed that  COMPETITION KILLS COOPERATION and that creating rivalry among people often  undermines the outcome in the long run.<br />I have always had a  constitutional aversion for &quot;lollipop&quot; awards; that is, awards  passed out like lollipops to every participant.  In some instances all  participants receive a uniform prize.  Nobody's performance is being  distinguished, so therefore a prize is asinine and meaningless.  As well  intentioned as this is, no playing field can ever be level and merely  dispensing such uniform &quot;lollipops&quot; flies in the face of what  awards are really for.  I personally detest the &quot;lollipop&quot; awards  and I, for one, would not ever be able to accept one in good conscience.   For me, it has to be earned fairly and honestly or it doesn't count.<br />If I  had my way, there would be no prizes and awards.  All they do is breed  rivalry and negative competition.  I feel they often undermine cooperation  and in many instances preclude cooperation.  I like &quot;intrinsic  rewards&quot; wherein a person feels good about their accomplishments and  receives positive verbal feedback.  My favorite uncle was a grand champion  at intrinsic rewards -- just knowing he felt you had done a good job or  that he was pleased with something you did was a major ego booster.  His  way was to offer words of gentle encouragement and his motto was simple:   if one expects the best, then one can reasonably believe they will GET the  best performance.  He did not pass out any type of award and he had a  strong sense of self and ethics.  This highly gifted man has imparted a  real gift -- the gift of hard work and taking pride in it.<br />This book is  an excellent statement to the above.  I would highly recommend it to  anyone.  People are more than conditioned responses and rewards often feed  into behaviorist thinking.	2000-08-25

Barry Neil Kaufman, his wife Samahria (then Suzy) and their daughters have shown just how strong and potent love really is.<br /><br />The Kaufmans' third child is a bright, beautiful little boy named Raun. Raun develops an ear infection early in infancy and from that point on develops autistic behaviors. He does not talk, he rocks and spins objects and only rarely looks at people or responds to his name.<br /><br />Refusing to give up on their child, the Kaufmans devise a one on one program with Raun. They choose the bathroom as their classroom because that is the one room that \\"has the least amount of distractors.\\" Raun's parents and sisters all participate with him in whatever he is doing, all the while talking to him about the activities. They turn Raun's solitary stimulation into a group activity and little by little Raun emerges from the shadows of autism.<br /><br />This is truly an outstanding book. You will not only come to dearly love the Kaufmans, you will come to see that they have provided a gift to all -- the gift of a healthy child.<br /><br />Note: Raun, born in 1973 is currently a CEO of the Autism Treatment Center of America in Sheffield, Massachussets and author of [[ASIN:1250063477 Autism Breakthrough: The Groundbreaking Method That Has Helped Families All Over the World]] and a beloved lecturer on the subject of autism.

Joanne is a much more appealing protagonist than  some of Joy Fielding's other characters.<br />It's decent, but as noted by a  few others, it is not what you would call a spine tingling thriller.  Joanne has to contend with a husband who walks out on her (a lot of  unfaithful husbands appear in Joy Fielding's works), two daughters who at  least are nice people, and a best friend who is a few planes short of a  squadron.  The poor woman is so distraught over not being able to carry a  baby to term that she becomes a hypochonrdriac.  She goes to doctors of  every branch under the sun and during one doctor's appointment, Joanne  connects with an old friend.  It seems the good doctor's receptionist is  sick and the place is in a state of chaos.

I couldn't do that now.\\"  My favorite  part was Raun's second grade assignment, which was to draw a picture of  himself.  His picture was of a beautiful pregnant woman.  When asked why he  drew a pregnant woman, he said, \\"That's my mother.  There is a little  boy inside her spinning a plate.\\"  That is a lovely story about how  this child was able to chart his own progress and development.<br /><br />The  Kaufmans and their dedicated team of loving people have proved time and  again the strength of love and hope. The case histories that are included  in this book are very interesting and thought provoking.  The Option  Program is indeed one of empowerment and helping people to recognize what  decisions they can make about their lives.<br /><br />This is definitely a must  read.

In one chapter, he describes a concentration-camp  like institution for autistic children where the kids are cattle prodded  into compliance. One weird task is to get the children to &quot;hug their  instructors.&quot;  Barry throws down the article in disgust, saying that  autism is a communciation disorder.  Why were the children in this place  treated this way and referred to as &quot;it&quot; instead of a boy or a  girl?  And why would anybody want to hug their instructors if their  instructors treated them like Holocaust prisoners.  Barry is a very astute,  loving, kind, intelligent and humane person.  He has my unflagging respect.  So does his wife, Sumitra (formerly Suzy) and their three children, Bryn,  Thea and Raun.  They are truly sterling examples of what love is really all  about.<br />God bless the Kauffmans!  God bless the Sotos!

It is very touching and you might even cry if you read it.<br /><br />Anna Solden is the youngest of 5 children. There are the 11-year-old twins, Fritz and Frieda, older sister Gretchen, 13 and brother Rudi, 15.  Anna and her family leave Germany and emigrate to Canada in 1933. Anna, then 9 wonders why she can't draw or knit like her sisters or help her brothers shovel snow or do any of the sundry household chores that need to be done. Anna's father is a very kind man who recognizes Anna's potential and encourages her every step of the way.<br /><br />Once in Canada, the Solden children are given a routine physical. The doctor, aghast to learn that Anna suffers from low vision works like a soldier to get Anna enrolled in a Sight Savers class. Once there, Anna flourishes. Outfitted with eyeglasses, she sees just what she had been missing all along. She develops confidence in her newfound abilities and makes friends readily with her classmates.<br /><br />Anna, still determined to prove her worth is desperate to come up with Christmas gifts for her parents and siblings. Her teacher, a very wise woman suggested that the class weave wastebaskets. They do and Anna's basket is the one that stands the straightest without even the slightest hint of a bend. Stroked further by her teacher's praise, Anna sets to work finding ways to get gifts for everyone. She writes a beautiful poem for a classmate who defended her (\\"Benjamin Nathaniel/Braver than Daniel\\"), writes a hilariously illustrated dictionary of new words she learned for another classmate and, on Christmas morning presents her parents and siblings with the basket. Shock abounds and her siblings jeer at her, saying she could not have done that basket without help.<br />Ever ready to fight for her, Anna's father chews out the other four children reminding them that had they not had the help and input of others, they, too, would have turned up empty handed on Christmas. Everyone relents, and Anna's gentle father springs a lovely surprise for all -- Anna had invited some guests for Christmas and he heartily endorsed her request. The guests -- Anna's teacher and doctor!<br /><br />This is a masterpiece. It is a classic.Anna's gentle father springs a lovely surprise for all -- Anna had invited some guests for Christmas and he heartily endorsed her request. The guests -- Anna's teacher and doctor!

Bright and highly verbal, Nick  demonstrated rare talents from a very early age.  At 6  months, he greeted  people with, &quot;I'm incredible!&quot;  And indeed he was.  He spoke in  full sentences by age one and his first birthday party brought a smile to  my face when Nick insisted on having &quot;disco music and a clown&quot;  (remember folks, this was 1979). As a toddler, Nick talked about &quot;when  he was big&quot; and he &quot;was here before.&quot;  I was sorry the  author was terrified by this and did not wxplore this further as it would  have been interesting to know Nick's perspective.<br />Nick abosbed languages  early and was fluent in Spanish and Italian before he was three.  He made  fine distinctions in language and this was apparent in his refusal to learn  French.  For some reason, Nick never liked French and objected strenuously  to hearing it spoken in his presence.<br />I loved Nick's strong stand on  everything.  He refused to wear certain things (&quot;that has a giraffe on  it! You expect me to wear that! &quot;) and showed a maturity that one does  not readily associate with toddlers.<br />Problems showed up early in Nick's  life.  Slow to toilet train, Nick wet and soiled himself and the bathtub  until he was four.  Pictures were done in harsh, black crayon.  Nick showed  sexual precocity by pinching women's bottoms and talking in quite an adult  sounding manner about &quot;loving the ladies.&quot;  This from a  pre-schooler!<br />Nick's flair for the original marked his entire, short  life.  He methodically collected and sorted baseball cards, he loved lip  synching in costume at his school's annual show, he loved writing poetry  and singing.  It came as no surprise to learn that Nick got his own rock  band together while still a teenager and that his poetry was of an  unusually high caliber.<br />Nick's mental illness appeared to show up early  in his life, but it was not until he was in middle school that it was  formally recognized.  He reverted to soiling the bathtub at age 11 and the  death of a classmate seemed to set his development back further.  On the  one hand, Nick was very much a child, rebelling about clothing and on the  other hand he exuded an adult aura that was at times, frightening.  A good  example of this was how he convinced the daughter of a friend of his mother  and adopted father that he was really in college and that he was really 21.  (He was about 12 then). It was incredible, (yes, Nick's word) that this  child was so precocious in adult sexual behavior and very convincing in his  presentation.  He clearly had a gift for acting from all accounts and was  wonderfully original and creative.<br />During his teen years, Nick suffered  breakdowns and was hospitalized.  Whenever he toured with his band, he had  a medical attendant tag along to supervise him and be sure he had his  regular dosages of medication.  Nick seemed to accept his mental condition  and seemed to feel he would just have to cope with it.  In typically  sounding Nick fashion, I couldn't help smiling at the author's description  of how Nick was mentally on a par with adult patients, but nothing like  them as far as life experiences.  He had never had to confront day-to-day  issues of adult life, e.g. raising a family, paying taxes, job hunting,  buying a home and the like.  Intellectually, Nick could hold his own and do  so admirably.  He was one of the most interesting people I have ever read  about.<br />Sadly, Nick was like a comet.  Bright and beautiful, a gifted work  of art, Nick was so consumed with depression and mental illness that he  ultimately took his life.  Like a comet, the likes of this bright light  will never be seen again.up early  in his life, but it was not until he was in middle school that it was  formally recognized.

In this book, Cook opens with the topic of the Salem Witch  Trials.<br />One of the things I like about Robin Cook's style is the way his  prelude covers a different era and is neatly entwined with the main body of  the story.<br />This book is about how the Salem Witch trials were most  likely drug induced, the culprit being rye used for making rye bread.  People unknowingly ate the drug and as a result were under the influence of  a very potent substance.<br />The protagonist is a likable, believable and  very sympathetic character.  Kim is an avid student of the Salem Witch  trials because she had an ancestor named Elizabeth who was hanged during  the trials.  Kim's home is a treasure trove of Salem memorabilia including  letters that were written by zealous, misguided magistrates during that era  and by Elizabeth and her children.  Eight generations later, Kim uncovers a  portrait of Elizabeth and is astounded at the physical resemblance.  Immediately feeling bonded to her ancestor and receiving no help from her  parents who feel threatened by Salem and feel this is a skeleton in the  family closet, she sets on her own quest for truth.  In so doing, she  uncovers a group of medical professionals who use a similar substance with  devastating results.<br />Dr. Cook brilliantly entwines the disparate studies  of Salem and medical experimentation in a convining fashion.<br />Great work!	2000-08-24

But are these pastures greener?  The step daughter becomes mouthier and more out of control and claims a  &quot;monster&quot; climbs into her window at night and on one memorable  occasion, crops her crowning glory.<br />Emily, to her credit takes the girl  to a local psychiatrist as her regular doctor is not in the area.  Rachel  starts improving her conduct and her fresh mouth, but the question remains  about the monster.<br />Turns out the monster is a challenged young man who  just happens to be abnormally large and from the author's descriptions, not  too cute.  His features are irregular and his speech is limited.  The  question is, why didn't Rachel call the police when this guy climbed into  her window?

I liked Carol and felt  she was at least making a genuine effort.  She was not getting a prize in  the deal -- who would want Dawn for a step daughter?  Who would want Dawn  period?  She is a spoiled, selfish jerk.<br />I also got impatient with Jill.  She's an infantile character who is barely out of the carriage and I smiled  at the description of her -- &quot;13 going on 11.&quot;  She was an  airhead with nothing to say and I found myself really not liking her.  I  didn't like her in the &quot;California Diaries&quot; series either.<br />The  wedding scene was truly funny.  So was the description of each character.  I liked Jeff, creepy Dawn's brother.  He was funny and believable.  He knew  what a knucklehead Jill was.<br />I liked the part when everybody got  together on the end, as one could easily have predicted.

Robert Kennedy was the brother who exemplified  fraternal loyalty in his tireless efforts to promote Jack and to serve him  during his tenure as president.  Robert Kennedy was the man who, to some  extent worked behind the scenes to promote his older brother.  It has been  said that a more devoted or more dedicated show of brotherly love in public  office has yet to be found.<br />The one down side to Robert Kennedy's efforts  is that he often sublimated his own identity, interests and needs so as to  promote his brother.  It is only in the tragic aftermath of President  Kennedy's death does Robert Kennedy fully emerge as his own person.  The  same hard work ethic he applied behind the scenes is shown to the public at  large.  Robert Kennedy does indeed find his voice and his forte, which is  commanding the interest and attention of his public.  The man who would be  president in 1968 becomes a symbol of hope -- he is the voice representing  the disenfranchised, the minorities and those living in poverty.  He is the  man who becomes personally involved with a large segment of the population  that had, up until recent history been excluded from many public fora.  It  is to Robert Kennedy's credit that he makes himself aware of such issues.  Indeed, this book treats the brothers with respect and as with any work  about Robert Kennedy, one is always left with the question of what would  have been had this man lived to be elected president in 1968.	2000-08-23

I like the Stacey character and find her level and mature and very believable.  Ms. Martin  has a real gift for creating characters with staying power and her natural  flair for dialog and conversation is phenomenal.<br />In this story, Stacey's  school has a series of &quot;short takes&quot; classes.  Professionals  offer to teach a class in their area of expertise for part of a marking  period.  Movie making was one such class and Stacey eagerly agreed to  participate in that one.  She is grouped with a compatible bunch of kids  and, armed with camera and notebooks, learn a lot about how their class  mates really feel.  My favorite parts were Claudia's confession about her  strong distate for school and Emily Black, the school editor's adept  dodging of any discussion of herself.  Turning the question around to the  asker is a very effective dodge and I loved that part.  I also liked seeing  a more mature version of Mary-Anne.<br />This one is one that I think most  readers will enjoy.

She's bright, attractive and she is coping  with a life threatening illness.  She has been very soldierly about her  diabetes and the Stacey books have been helpful in explaining and taking  stigma out of the condition.<br />Stacey understandably wants to eat like a  non-diabetic.  She craves sweets, and this unfortunately throws her insulin  off the charts.  She helps her favorite charge Charlotte and Charlotte's  friend Becca bake brownies and is overcome with temptation.  She sneaks the  brownies and this aggravates the down cycle her diabetes has taken.<br />Stacey's father invites her to spend a weekend in Manhattan.  Tired and  sick, Stacey reluctantly agrees.  To add to her stress level, her father  makes pointed comments about her mother and grills her about her mother's  social life.  Stacey in turn has to go through a similar interrogation from  her mother when she returns from a visit to Manhattan.  Her divorced  parents fight over her and Stacey handles this maturely.<br />Once in  Manhattan, Stacey is so ill that she is almost immediately admitted to a  hospital.  Her BSC friends from CT visit and the one time Stacey convinced  both parents to visit her together ends up a major disaster.  The parents  scream at each other until Stacey finally tells them to leave.<br />After a  seemingly long recovery period, Stacey is discharged.  Once back in safe  Stoneybrook, she tells her mother that she will no longer be &quot;the  monkey in the middle&quot; by delivering nasty messages from one parent to  the other.  She points out the unfairness and cruelty in this and to the  mother's credit, she supports Stacey and recognizes the mature way Stacey  approached this.  Stacey then calls her father with her stand.  She has  stood her ground and she has succeeded.<br />Stacey is here to stay.	2000-08-23

I loved the descriptions of the places across the country that the girls got to see.  I do agree with the reviewers who  wonder when the girls will be promoted to 9th grade and it is a tad  unrealistic that these same girls would keep having adventures.<br />Clock  issue:  How can they have fitted the European vacation in with this cross  country jaunt?  Calendar issue:  How many days were involved on both trips?  Add to this question the trips these kids have taken in previous books,  such as the cruise in the first super special, the island disaster and the  Manhattan excursion.  Where is the clock and the calendar?<br />I liked this  book because it showed the girls maturing.  Despite her detractors, I like  the Stacey character.  Dawn is the only one I don't like.  She has a big  mouth and she keeps putting her foot in it.  I wish she would keep her foot  in her mouth because a closed mouth gathers no feet.  Mary-Anne finally  grew a back bone and told Dawn's dad not to dis her dad and grandmother.  I  was glad because I felt the man was way out of line to talk about  somebody's dad that way.  Regardless of what one may think, it is usually  not a good idea to criticize somebody's parent(s) to them.  Mary-Anne  raised a good point -- Dawn's dad's kidding had a hostile, barbed edge.  When people kid around, they don't always know how their audience is taking  it.  I loved the part where Mary-Anne told him how out of line he was.  I  also liked her grandmother and I would like to see her in more  stories.<br />Bring Shannon back!  She's been lost in limbo! I liked her!	2000-08-22

She is  especially gentle with the terrier and Charley, the rescue dog appoints  herself Jess' companion.  When Jess whelps in the pantry, Charley helps her  clean off the newborn pups. Mandy jokingly calls Charley the puppies'  &quot;aunt&quot; because she helps take care of them.  Jess remains the  enignmatic, funny little dog and her puppies are simply adorable.

It is also very effective.<br />Jessi, one of the more appealing characters  has a new teacher for a limited period named Mr. Trout.  He wears retro  clothing, a badly fitting, poorly styled wig and is the subject of cruel  teasing by his pupils.  During a Teachers' Parody show, Mr. Trout leaves.  Jessi, remorseful at having been part of the razzing of Mr. Trout, writes  him a really nice letter apologizing for her part in it and asking him to  return to Stoneybrook.

Mr. Bellafatto is a smart, stern, no nonsense  type and he commands respect.  The students know not to push his buttons!  He does not beg the kids to like him by letting them walk all over him.

That speaks  to sensitivity and creativity.<br />Betsy Sobak, Claudia's young charge is a  virtuoso in the fine art of practical jokes.  Her jokes are hostile and are  always at the expense of another person.  During Claudia's first sitting  stint with Betsy, she falls from a tire swing and breaks her leg.  Luckily  for Claudia, her trio of sitting pals come through like the Cavalry by  out-joking Betsy (in a safe way, of course) to teach her an object lesson  in how to treat people in a humane fashion.  Lesson:  It is only kidding or  funny if all sides are enjoying it, but if one side is not having fun, it  is no longer kidding, it is mean.<br />I liked Betsy.  The description given  of her sounds like a cute kid with a vivid imagination.  Ann Martin has a  real gift for descriptions, dialogs, character development and I like the  way the charges have a parallel plot running to the central plot the  sitters are contending with.

Mary-Anne's dad marries creepy Dawn's mother.  They are polar  opposites -- he's fastidious and fussy, like Felix Unger whereas she is  casual and cavalier, like Oscar Madison.  I thought some of her misplaced  items were actually funny, e.g. socks in the refrigerator and the  like.<br />Mary-Anne has to contend with the pushy, overbearing Dawn.  (Poor  kid)!  She is a gentle, somewhat naive girl who has a good heart and would  not even so much as swat a mosquito.  Dawn, on the other hand would walk  over her own brother and mother in a second.  She is brash and  inconsiderate and in general is a brat.  The parents each support the step  child in the interest of furthering family harmony and luckily it all gets  resolved in the end.  Each girl gets her own room and luckily the house was  big enough to provide this nice solution.	2000-08-21

What better job for her than babysitting?  She has twin  nephews right there in her Full House!  She somehow cons a naive mother  into letting her babysit with disastrous results.  Not to worry, smart,  cute, savvy and clever Stephanie comes to the rescue and not only finds the  baby but bails Michelle out of diaper duty.

Beau, despite  his unfortunate name runs into some major fortune in his temper management  class.  Mr. &quot;Nak&quot; of &quot;Nak's Pack&quot; is a delightful man  who appears to have his challenging charges under his wing.

I have never come across a story about a dog I have loved nearly as much as Shiloh (and Daisy, the mama dog of author Kopper fame). Shiloh really is a continuum of love.  Christian themes such as love, forgiveness and taking  the challenge to rebuild lives are visited in this gentle conclusion to a  first rate trilogy.  Mere words do not do this book nor its author justice.  The best suggestion one could possibly make is to encourage others to read  the &quot;Shiloh&quot; trilogy.<br />A nod to the author -- beagles have  always been my favorite breed of dog.  I adopted an abandoned, hurt beagle  at a local shelter.  Her name is Falcon.  In recent years, Falcon has  become a pet therapy dog in a local nursing home where she delights the  senior citizens there.  One of the nurses fell in love with Falcon.  Since  she said her dad was getting her a dog for her birthday, she picked a  beagle because she loved Falcon.  She could not think of a name for her  hound, so I suggested &quot;Clover,&quot; after the real dog who inspired  the &quot;Shiloh&quot; trilogy.  Within a few days, she told me that her  hound was named &quot;Clover.&quot;  This Clover delights the seniors in  that home as well.<br />Falcon is a fixture in her neighborhood and community.  There is a large female beagle in the neighborhood named Shiloh because  her young owner loved the &quot;Shiloh&quot; trilogy so much he wanted to  be like Marty and have a cool dog like Marty.<br />This author, to her credit  has created a continuum of love.  We love Marty, his family and his  delightful hound, Shiloh.  They are here to stay!	2000-08-19

The  only part that really bothered  me was when Jenn's mother, learning she was  pregnant with a third daughter, said she'd give the child up for adoption.  That was stupid.  I think it would have been best to keep the baby and get  rid of her no good father and to have protected the two older girls.

Sarah Byrnes, the title character had her face burned by  her sadistic father during a drunken rage.  Her mother fled and so the girl  was left with the monstrous father.  Sarah Byrnes confronts her  disfigurement by insisting folks call her by her full name, &quot;Sarah  BYRNES.&quot;  Her best friend is a boy who will go to bat for her and then  some.  He stays by her side and even helps her get admitted to a hospital  so she can escape her father.<br />Luckily for Sarah and her friends, they  find hope in an angel of a teacher who goes to bat for them all.  This  teacher figures out Sarah is planning to flee her father and the town and  figures out how to find her and foil her escape.  The girl has plastic  surgery to restore her looks and her young friends flock to her side yet  again.  This is a delightful book with very sympathetic characters.<br />I  also like the way the author deals with very serious, adult topics ranging  from sexuality to political misconduct.  He treats each subject seriously  and intelligently and his books are always a thought provoking pleasure to  read.	2000-08-19

I liked Sunny, Maggie, Ducky and Amalia.  They were much more appealling and much more sympathetic  characters.<br /><br />Although I didn't like the infantile Jill, I felt sorry for  her.  She was one step out of the carriage and clearly did not fit in with  the others.  I thought it was rotten of nasty Dawn and the others to use  her as a means to attend a drinking party.  They insulted their hostess,  Jill and made it clear they were using her.  All right, I didn't like Jill  or her stupid teddy bears either, but that still does not excuse the  behavior of those other girls.<br /><br />I wish Dawn had been taken to task for  sneaking off to that party.  I am sorry her dad and step mother Carol never  learned about the party and that the school counselor let her off the hook.  That was not fair to the other students who DIDN'T attend the party, but  were penalized anyway for the damages incurred.  (The principal of their  high school called a special assembly and declared that each grade had to  kick in $400.00 to cover damages the party caused to the house, which just  happened to be that of the school counselor).  I wish that selfish brat had  been exposed to light and made to answer for what happened at that party.  It would have been great if her dad or step mother had given her a stern  dressing down about being a gracious guest.  Something like, \\"I can  appreciate how friendships change and people move in different directions.  You don't have to accept every invitation you get, but when you do, at least be  gracious.  Never make your host or hostess feel bad for inviting you.  You  all went out of your way to make Jill feel bad and the message was quite  obvious -- you didn't want to be bothered with her.  Even if you didn't  like the activities she suggested, at least turn them down politely.  Suggest something else.  I can understand why her party might have been too  young for you, but there was just no excuse for your behavior or the way  you all treated her.\\"  Dawn needs some strict discipline -- she keeps  getting away with things that aren't good.r the way  you all treated her.\\"  Dawn needs some strict discipline -- she keeps  getting away with things that aren't good.	2000-08-17

That was when I was first introduced to her works and I can honestly say I have  never once been disappointed. The characters are richly and vividly drawn  and the story lines overlap and mesh together well.  The family patriarch,  Oliver Grey has a major flaw -- he is a pedophile.  He not only has abused  his granddaughter, Tina, he has also abused a niece many years earlier.  Sally, the mother of Tina and the daughter-in-law of Oliver, wisely  believes Tina when the child finally discloses what her grandfather had  been doing to her.  The only thing I had trouble with was when Sally told  Tina that she [Tina] \\"mustn't let anybody touch her\\" if she  didn't want them to.  For pity's sake, a child cannot fend off an adult  predator and to even suggest the child let her grandfather touch her  improperly smacks of blame.  This was a five-year-old, not an adult  contemporary.  She did not want, welcome or like what the man did to her  and it is never the child's fault.  Children don't LET adult predators hurt  them.  That was the only part I had trouble with.  I also wondered why  Daniel and Sally didn't talk to Tina first when they had reason to believe  something was amiss.  It seemed that communication was a long time coming,  but it was wonderful once it did.<br /><br />I liked the way the reader was kept  guessing.  One never knew which way the family business would turn.  Would  environmental or business interests be chosen?  A combination?  And who  really killed Oliver Grey?  This is an excellent book and I would highly  recommend it. I loved it.	2000-08-17

Phyllis Reynolds Naylor draws very real, believable characters that one can  readily recognize and relate to.  Her protagonist, Marty, exemplifies true  Christian values when he is able to forgive Judd Travers. Villianizing Judd  and making him a ready scapegoat would have been easy.  It is to this  author's credit that she protrays Judd as a tragic figure who has fallen on  hard times and who has let the shadows of his past dictate the decisions he  has made in his life.  Making a hero out of Marty would have been too easy.  Instead, the author shows a realistic, lovable boy who takes on major  responsibilities.  Marty grapples with the twin challenges of hatred for  Judd and wanting to do the right thing, which is to help the man when he  clearly needs it.  He acknowledges these feelings and works hard to  overcome them as he does now own Judd's hound, Shiloh.  The beautiful  little hound has a near-miss with death and Judd Travers saves his life.  It is in the bond, this common love for the beagle that Marty is able to  forgive Judd his cruelties and lesser foibles and Judd can start making  peace with his life.  There is nothing pat or simplistic about this story  -- it will resonate in one's heart and conscious long after the last page  is turned.  It is a continuum of love -- Marty's love for his family and  Shiloh, his acceptance and forgiveness of Judd Travers and Shiloh's  unconditional love for the men who saved his life.  It is a joyous moment  in literature to see Marty own the delightful little beagle once and for  all.<br />Please read the &quot;Shiloh&quot; trilogy.  You'll be very glad  you did.	2000-08-17

She saves  every letter from Travis and the recordings they did in smoky coffeehouses  (were there any coffeehouses in the 1960s that WEREN'T smoky) and college  circuits.  Alone and confused, she comes to the quiet community to regroup.<br />Sheriff Arrowood, a town fixture takes to Peggy.  Attractive and blessed  with a beautiful voice, she provides a spark of interest into the small  community.  Arrowood's brother was a casualty of the war and he feels  immediately bonded to the enigmatic Peggy.<br />Peggy leans on Arrowood when  she becomes the target of a series of threatening letters, seemingly  written by Travis. Since he has been dead for 20-odd years, she wonders who  knows Travis well enough to ape his writing style.<br />Pix-Kyle, a Vietnam  era Rambo wannabe, latches himself onto Peggy.  A high school misfit with a  weird name, he has an unflagging obsession with anything related to the  Vietnam War.  He riles Arrowood with his incessant questions about the  latter's brother, who died in combat.  He riles other male adults in the  community by asking them to revisit the horror of Vietnam War atrocities.  Once he learns Peggy's former flame/collaborator Travis is a war casualty,  he turns his war obsession onto her.  He breaks into her house, reads her  letters and apes the writing style Travis used in them.  He sends Peggy  letters, trying to make it sound like Travis is not really dead, but  somewhere in the area watching her.<br />The story is intense and  unforgettable.

He calls the boy &#34;Dummy&#34; and  uses him as a subject of an English composition.  His teacher naturally  calls him on his cruelty and insists that he get to know the boy he calls  Dummy.  Comstock, the protagonist does and in so doing learns that that boy  has a truckload of problems -- an autistic sister, a mother who works for  crumbs in a bakery and no other adult or back up to be found.<br /><br />Comstock  has horrible parents.  They compare him to the ghost of his dead brother,  crab at him when he accepts his $2.00 allowance instead of demanding more  (what a weird parental wish) and constantly hound and belittle him and his  sister, Susie.  Susie is the only character one can like.  She accepts  everyone including the boy called Dummy.  Her stupid parents think the boy  is dangerous and forbid her or Comstock to have any further contact with  them.  The mother mocks the boy and tells Susie he is bad.  Susie laughs at  the sheer madness of anyone thinking that boy is dangerous.  The stupid  mother slaps her and turns on Comstock, saying, &#34;By rights, mister, I  should have given that one to you.&#34;  That mother belonged in the  wastebasket.<br /><br />The end was simply unfinished business.  The boy called  Dummy was accused of killing a little girl (that was never explained) and  he is subsequently killed by folks who just have no sympathy for anyone  whose just a tad different.  As for Comstock, he suffers a mental breakdown  and ends up in an institution.  The story closes with Comstock saying that  he needs a new chest because he thinks he outgrew his old one.<br /><br />Now that  I've provided you with this information, do you STILL want to read this?	2000-08-17

The brat at 6  lies and smokes and sets Kelsey up to be blamed.  Kelsey finally gets her  to admit she was the one who smoked.  Kelsey also has an unloving mother  who seems so conditioned to respond negatively to anything from Kelsey.  I  hated that woman.  Kelsey's father seemed like a shadow figure without much  input and Kelsey's older sister was decent. Kelsey  has to survive that  wretched mother and little sister.  I was glad when Kelsey's knuckleheaded  mother finally admitted that she misjudged Kelsey after Kelsey saved her  bratty baby sister from drowning.  It is then that the brat admitted she  set Kelsey up to get in trouble and the stupid mother finally sees the  light.  I didn't like the moronic mother or the obnoxious baby sister one  bit.	2000-08-17

She is a California cliche -- blond, surfer, health food hound.  That is all just a stereotype.<br />In this  book, she rams her environmental interest (obsession, really)down  everybody's throat.  It was good that she was able to organize a recycle  team at her middle school.  It was good that she encouraged others to get  involved.  What was NOT good was the way she wanted credit for the whole  shebang.  That pitiful girl was so greedy for credit it was sad.  I liked  it when Stacey, a fellow sitter complained that Dawn was driving everybody  bananas by taking her environmental issues to an extreme.  She all but put  out a citizen's arrest on folks who weren't vegetarians or who threw away  paper, glass, plastic and metal products.  I think this girl needs to be  recycled.  I was glad when she moved back to the West Coast.	2000-08-17

I loved Max, the central character.  I thought he was so lucky to have  a wolf suit and later, a crown.<br />This charming classic is about a young  boy named Max who runs around the house threatening to eat everybody up.  He dons a wolf suit to complete his frightening image.  Max's mother who  has had enough of the boy's antics, remands him to his bedroom without  dinner.  Once alone, Max creates a wonderful fantasy about sailing far  away, for a year and a day, to where the wild things are.  The gently  illustrated cast of wild things will serve to delight all ages.  There is  nothing frightening about these gentle beasts and they all bear strong  familiar characteristics, e.g., one looks like a giant rooster and anther  creature has a buffalo head.  Max makes himself the star of this fantasy by  crowning himself King of the Wildthings.  Homesickness intrudes and Max  tells the gentle beasts he has to return home.  Using Max's threat, they  vow to &quot;eat him up, they love him so.&quot;  Max stays tough and  leaves the wildthings and heads home.  Once safely ensconsed in his room,  he finds dinner waiting.<br />It was still hot.<br />A nice welcoming for Max and  a welcome treat for all ages.  Even now, many years later, I still love  this book.	2000-08-17

It is a very sad story, to say the least.  Roger Baxter is the protagonist of this tale.  At 12, he has a speech problem that precludes him from relating to peers.  He is understandably embarrassed about his inability to pronounce  &#34;R&#34; and rues having &#34;Rs&#34; in his name.  Roger has a  mother nobody would wish for and a disinterested father, who ultimately get  divorced.  At the opening of the story, Californian Roger has traveled  across country to Manhattan with his wretched mother. Flashbacks are  interspersed throughout the story and in each one, Roger relates yet  another horror story of maternal abuse.  At 6, he is verbally flayed and  locked in his room because he was too scared to order a hamburger at the  UCLA cafeteria; at 3, he remembers the mother's &#34;mean mouth&#34; when  he injured his tongue chewing on a styptic pencil.  In New York, he makes  some friends, among them the cute Nemo Newman and a French citizen,  Monsieur Roger Tunnel.  Tunnel and a school speech teacher are the only  adult characters one can like. They both take Roger under their wings and  try to nurse him through the mental breakdown he suffers at the close of  the book.  Poor Roger is committed to Bellevue and his stupid mother won't  even be bothered with him.  All that vapid, vain thing wants to do is  travel to Florida where she can get some sun and sees the institution as a  place where Roger can be safely deposited.  Roger's speech teacher  rightfully cleans the mother's clock when she walks in on the mother  haranguing the boy shortly after his discharge from Bellevue.  She deftly  punches Roger's mother in the jaw, which she richly deserved.  Poor Roger  is left in the limbo of mute mental illness. Roger Tunnell is a treat -- he  actually cares about Roger.<br /><br />Now that I've told you this story, do you  really still want to read it?  Read something else instead.  Gently put,  this is a downer..	2000-08-17

Daisy, the anvil-headed English bull terrier brings smiles to the faces of all with her clever antics. She, like her human counterpart takes pride and pleasure in her offspring and she is clearly a ringleader in humorous mischief. Daisy and Shiloh, (the literary beagle Phyllis Reynolds Naylor immortalized in literature) are the most appealling fictional dogs. I love the way Daisy aligns herself with the baby's mother, which makes for a funny parallel to an earlier book where Daisy imitates the baby. Daisy appears as a delightful, fun-loving spontaneous little English bull terrier who will find herself permanently wedged in the hearts of all who encounter her.<br />WE LOVE DAISY!	2000-08-17

This book was a tad better  than most vintage Andrews/Ghostwritten stories.  Cat was a sympathetic  character who didn't have the requisite artistic talent and who didn't have  a sibling with whom she had an incestuous relationship. (Her stepfather  brought incest into this installment, folks).  The one thing that bothered  me was why on earth did Cat's natural mother give her to her stepdaughter  to raise?  The stepdaughter was a bitter, iodine like woman who treated Cat  shabbily.  The stepfather raped and terrorized the girl for years.  The one  breath of fresh air in this series is that Cat and her fellow  &quot;Wildflowers&quot; (Jade, Misty and Star) meet at a psychiatrist's  office where they heal and bloom. I'm not an avid Andrews/Ghostwriter's  fan, but I will say that the &quot;Wildflowers&quot; series is the best of  the bunch.<br />All V.C. Andrews books are a lot like broth or plain pudding.  They're light and bland and will sustain the interest of the reader.  They  are not too different from inane sitcoms or a bowl of broth.  These books  are light and will help you pass the time.  The best place for all V.C.  Andrews books is in any waiting room.  They're light, quick reads that will  help you pass the time in the check out line or in a waiting room very  quickly.	2000-08-17

I did like the Barrett trio and their lovable basset hound, Pow.  (I just love basset  hounds).<br />Dawn always seemed like a self-involved character who just  can't accept much input from others gracefully.  Although she bossed the  kids' mother into being a little more organized (that was good), she tried  throwing her weight around with other kids and that was not so good.

Robert Sr., the husband of the protagonist is a spouse batterer.  He also verbally abuses  their daughter because of her weight problem.  The protagonist  unfortunately and unwisely stays with this verbally, physically and  mentally cruel man because she sees no other options for herself.  The  daughter wisely runs away after her father has belittled her one too many  times.  She travels out of state, which makes her a more affluent and  resourceful runaway than many.  I loved Bruce and despite what another  reviewer has written, was glad the protagonist found a loving man instead  of settling for that beast Robert, Sr.<br />I was sorry she did not protect  her children sooner and I also wish she had not named their son after his  cruel father.  I wouldn't have named a donkey after him!<br />Belva Plain's  books are a treat for me.  Unlike another reviewer notes, I am glad she  steers clear from tired, cliche bedroom scenes replete with graphic  descriptions of physical intimacy.  Hers is the gentle allusion to physical  contact and her books are, in my estimation, entertaining, thought  provoking and extremely well written.	2000-08-17

Armed camps square off -- it's Abby, Stacey and Kristy vs.  Claudia and Mary-Anne.  Don't worry, folks, it all gets sorted out in the  end. Kristy in typical fashion runs off at the mouth and insults everybody.  By the penultimate chapter, apologies are abound and the story is neatly  concluded with everyone being friends again.  (And yes, Abby, Stacey and  Kristy  DO travel abroad while the others remain stateside).  A light,  entertaining read.	2000-08-15

Why the  Board of Health hasn't come after these folks for housing all these animals  is anyone's guess.<br />I loved the way the girls all stood up to that  dictator, Kristy.  It was long past time somebody challenged her and I  didn't like the way Kristy ran roughshod over everyone.  I also didn't like  that stupid Baby Sitters' pledge Kristy made up and I thought Mary-Anne  looked like a fool for crying over it and saying how beautiful the pledge  was.  Horsefeathers!

The story centers around Rozzy, who suffers from a psychotic break at age 11 in a 6th grade  classroom. The girls' mother, Bea, is a miserable excuse for a mother.  She  is sneaky, childish and deceitful.  For example, instead of telling Rozzy  not to lick herself clean as does a cat, she cooked up some stupid story  about &quot;a little girl down the street&quot; who had &quot;hairballs in  her stomach.&quot;  Ben, the father was truly monstrous.  He stopped loving  Rozzy as soon as she suffered from psychotic symptoms.  He cut her out of  his life and rebuffed any overtures on her part. They seem to have  relinquished their roles as parents by insisting the girls address them as  &quot;Bea&quot; and &quot;Ben&quot; instead of by parental appellations.  That is bizarre. Then again, who would want those two miserable excuses for  parents?  Even rats take better care of their own.<br />As for the sister  Bess, she is a back stabbing, two-faced phony.  She is a hypocrite  extraordinaire.  She criticizes Rozzy for answring ads for sex in  &quot;Boston After Dark&quot; and accuses her of advertising her  promiscuity, yet Bess gets her friend Hilly to advertise her own sexual  escapades with a boy in her classes.  Bess is nobody to throw stones.  She  is disgusting.<br />The girls' mother is ineffectual and the father is  completely addlepated when it comes to caring about others.  It does not  surprise this reviewer that Rozzy's nasty sister is a lot like him.<br />The  protagonist delights in Rozzy's misfortune, such as when she was expelled  from high school and sent to a special school out of state.  She flaunts  her sexual relationship with the simian-obssessed David, who really is a  monkey's uncle and lets that stupid Bess make a monkey out of him. I was  glad he finally had enough sense to jump Bess' ship.<br />Rozzy, her  boyfriend/husband Stewey (he was an ANGEL extraordinaire) and their cousin  Trina were the only ones I like.

How did she just happen to be kidnapped and taken to an  Egyptian tomb?  Although this doesn't seem realistic folks, that's ok.

Psychiatrist Kate Sinclair is a master at helping strangers straighten out their issues, but she has quite a few on her plate.  She is also untrustworthy.  I didn't like Kate at all.  Kate is yet another loathsome female protagonist - to wit, we have Gail, who was truly loathsome from \\"Life Penalties\\" and Jess of \\"Tell Me No Secrets\\" and Nicole of \\"The Other Woman\\" infamy.<br />Her half sister, JoLynn has taken up with a murderer. Her older daughter Sara goes through the worst of adolescence and bratty younger daughter Michelle is a favored, pampered little queen. (I didn't like Michelle). I felt Kate was unfair to Sara and I didn't like the way she just took it for granted that Sara would go along with her [Kate's] just taking her room to install her terminally ill mother. Poor Sara must have felt displaced. I also hated it when she slapped Sara. I was glad Sara hit her back! It was unfair of her to threaten to throw Sara out if she ever struck Sara again. I wish snotty Michelle had been slapped. She was phony and two-faced and every bit as loathsome as Kate. I actually breathed a sigh of relief when nasty Michelle took up smoking (a singularly VILE vice) and Kate wised up to the kind of obnoxious liar Michelle really was.  Kate was singularly odious.<br />I had trouble with JoLynn's murderous lover. Instead of a cliche ending, the lover steals JoLynn's Toyota Camry and kills her. That made for a tragic ending, yet it was good this book did not become yet another cliche. It was \\"tolerable\\" in spite of Kate and Michelle.	2000-08-15

I think she is vapid, vain and self centered.  That notwithstanding, this whole story was completely  implausible. What was the point of School Spirit Week, anyhow?  Ditzy  Dawn's sensible stepsister Mary-Anne had enough sense to bail out of the  ludicrous middle school tradition. I agree, the whole stupid thing should  never have been compulsory, but why was it?  Nobody could have EVER paid ME  to wear p.j.'s to school or do any of the other stupid things the kids in  this book did for School Spirit.  I also didn't like the way the adult  community acted like idiots about it and all that did was point up just how  divisive and needless the Spirit Week really was. It was just plain  stupid.<br />I was glad that the compulsory standing was rescinded and that  the students could elect to participate or not, as they saw fit.  I also  didn't like the way it undermined what School Spirit was really about.  Instead of these stupid pranks, why not have the kids do community work,  such as visiting folks in nursing homes, bringing food to the inbound and  doing clean up work on the school grounds?  That shows an interest in  others and real spirit by being a part of a community, whether it be a  school community or the public at large.	2000-08-15

Whereas I can see why some folks might see her as being self centered, I don't.  She's trying to cope with her mother's impending death  and by filling her mind and time with other things she can table the  inevitable. I like Sunny, but I just can't abide that ghastly Dawn.  I  think Dawn is a pushy bully who tries to boss everyone around.  I hated the  way she tried to take over Sunny's mother.  The little wretch had never had  to experience losing a parent to death, so she was in no position to try to  keep  Sunny away from her pregnant step-mother, Carol.  Sunny needed a  stable adult female and was lucky to have found that in Carol. Dawn made a  big issue over that stupid stew pot Sunny accidentally burned.  All right,  Sunny should have been watching it instead of flirting with a guy.  Even  so, I think stupid Dawn and that housekeeper made a volcano out of a  molehill.  Carol could walk and if need be, could certainly  have turned of  the stove. Good grief.  I think Dawn was a jealous witch and tried to cause  friction between people.  I think she was the catalyst in the Sunny-Dawn  rift.  Dawn really is for the birds.  Buzzards, that is. As for Sunny, she  rocks!  She keeps it together by making bad decisions and learning from  them.  She's not a shallow airhead like Dawn.  She's lucky she has a real  friend in Ducky who sticks by her and understands that when she lashes out  at him, she is really lashing out at her mother's illness.  Sunny is here  to stay.	2000-08-15

Suburban mom Jenny Meade spends a lot of time carpooling her 4-year-old Linnea and her Matthew, 10-year-old Patsy and her big mouthed friend Crista and 14-year-old Philip from school to swim meets to home. Jenny is a semi-retired pilot anxious to get back into the wild blue yonder. Berlie, Jenny's husband has some neo-Neanderthal ideas of what he expects of his wife -- he wants her to get a ghastly station wagon instead of keeping the spiffy 1979 Honda Accord (to her credit, Jenny keeps the Honda) and tries to ground her airplane aspirations. To her credit, Jenny gets back into the cockpit at the end of the story.<br /><br />To throw some adult themes into the mix, we have a suicide (actually it is a murder, but Jenny won't rest until she finds the killer), and her kids' doctor is an adulterer about town. It ain't great folks, but it'll entertain you when the computer is down and you finished all your other pleasure reading.	2000-08-15

I have been an avid Jon Kellerman fan since 1986 when I first read,  \\"When the Bough Breaks.\\"  This book delivers a neat punch with  its myriad of twists and subplots.  Kellerman is a master at his craft, a  gifted mystery writer and his characters are all given full, realistic  descriptions.  His dialogs remain impeccable and he certainly knows how to  keep his readers on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />I admit that I never liked Alex Delaware's tiresome live-in lover Robin Castagna.  It seems that her main contribution is to serve meals; be a restaurant partner and a sex partner.  Occasionally her career as a luthier to the rock stars gets a nod, but the better part of her time is spend on food preparation or having meals with Dr. Delaware.  I am sick of how 98% of the interaction between Robin and Dr. Delaware, who is far more intelligent than Robin relates to eating.<br /><br />The description of the  central character, a mentally ill man called \\"Monster\\" because he  is accused of committing a heinous murder is very vivid.  Monster has been  committed to an institution and the author literally takes his readers into  that terrifying place that houses the dangerous mentally ill.  Questions arise as to if Monster is involved and if so, to what extent.  Many questions surrounding Starkweather crop up.  (Starkweather gets a nod in Kellerman's [[ASIN:0345505719 Victims: An Alex Delaware Novel]].  A highly verbal, seriously mentally ill man of immense height and strength might know something.  Other inmates and people the psychologist-law enforcer question raise one's interest.<br /><br />Despite his obvious mental illness, Monster is an interesting character and one who  will remain in the memory of most readers.  This book is excellent.	2000-08-15

I have thoroughly enjoyed all of his books, but this one left me a tad cold.  On  the one hand, he does a thorough job of indicting the meat packing industry  and managed health care.  It is very interesting to see how neatly he  intwines these two industries and shows the relationship between them. On  the other hand, I did not like the protagonist, Dr. Reggis or his brat of a  daughter. I felt Becky was rude to adults and had a very fresh mouth.  The  only thing I did like about her was her realistic view of figure skating --  if she went pro or went national, it would spoil the fun.  I also liked  Kim's estranged wife.  I felt she was level and together and had a lot on  her plate having to put up with him and cope with the subsequent death of  their daughter to E. Coli from bad meat.<br />One character I really liked was  David, the doctor who called Kim on his bad behavior in the waiting room  when Becky was first admitted. He was stern, he was adult, he was  reasonable.  I really liked him and felt he was thoroughly professional.<br />I agree with other readers that the ending is a bust.  Does Caroline,  Becky's skating peer develop the E. Coli?  If so, does she survive?	2000-08-15

Her husband jilts her and the husband of the woman who is having an affair with Lynn's husband becomes Lynn's lover. In short, they switch partners. Lynn's lover is a nice person, where as her husband paired off with a barracuda.<br />Renee Bowers (I agree with another reader -- I wish her name was pronounced like Renee, rhymes with day instead of Renee, rhymes with beanie) is the divorce attorney. Her husband is a cold, unloving and very cruel man who bears a mirror image to Renee's tyrannical father. His daughter Debbie from a previous marriage is no prize, either. Debbie is her daddy's daughter, all right.  She is a step daughter to beware of! I didn't like Debbie from the start and she and her nasty father Philip deserved each other.  Renee was a fool to put up with their tyranny and cruelty.<br />Debbie was sneaky, spoiled, spiteful and mean. For example, early in the book, 16-year-old Debbie cries about a nightmare she allegedly has about Renee killing her father in a car accident. It is hard to believe that a 16-year-old would wake up crying about a stupid dream. I, for one, don't believe she dreamed it. I was also disgusted with Philip's allowing himself to be taken in by his wretched daughter. All Debbie did was cause friction and try to pry Renee and Philip apart. I actually cheered when Renee finally slapped the loathsome, nasty girl good and hard across her face and told her where to go. I was glad that Renee appeared in a later book (\\"See Jane Run\\") and had the good sense to jump her father's ship, Philip's ship and disgusting Debbie's ship once and for good.	2000-08-15

I STILL LOVE IT!	My mother bought me this book for my 8th Christmas and it remains a favorite to this day. In it I found a sympathetic character in Elizabeth, the protagonist of this story. I could well sympathize with her inability to make friends easily (I had that same challenge) and agonizing over her small stature. I had the opposite problem -- I always thought I was abnormally tall until I reached my maximum height at 12 and am NOT tall for any adult!<br /><br />It was an interesting coming together of these two loners, Elizabeth and Jennifer. I think the whole \\"witchcraft\\" thing was to a large extent, childhood wishful thinking and playacting and the natural wish to distinguish oneself among one's peers. I loved this book and delighted in the antics of the two girls.<br /><br />Elizabeth's nemesis, the phony, duplicitous Cynthia is easily recognizable. I had to endure my share of \\"Cynthias\\" growing up and I can remember thinking how laughably clueless adults were to the phony, smarmy charm such creeps like Cynthia oozed. I thought it was mean of Elizabeth's mother to make her attend Cynthia's birthday party and to constantly sing Cynthia's praises to her. People who praise Other People's Children to their own make me tired.  That certainly did not help Elizabeth's esteem. I could relate to that because my mother used to sing the praises of other people's children to me. I can remember telling her time and again, \\"She's/They're just pretending to be nice because YOU'RE here. I can't just walk up to kids and make friends.\\" It was only after I had become an adult myself that I realized that my mother and her peers were not as susceptible to the smarmy Cynthias as I had been led to believe. It was in recent years that she has told me that she knew all along what sneaky, miserable little wretches those \\"Cynthias\\" were and that she was \\"friendly to them in the hopes they'd be nicer to me\\" whether she was present or not. How wonderful it would have been to have told me that in the first place! I would have known she was an ally then instead of easily misled by other people's children! This book is an eye opener for all ages.<br /><br />I still laugh uproariously over the way Elizabeth ate a raw onion per Jennifer's direction for a week. Her bizarre eating habits paid off -- I loved it when her onion breath scared nasty Cynthia who ran off the stage during a school play. I also loved the way she fixed Cynthia's wagon at Cynthia's birthday party by challenging her phony charm. Each time Cynthia oohed and aahed over a gift and asked who it was from, Elizabeth would call out the name of the giver, thus spoiling Cynthia's fun. I cheered when Elizabeth stepped on nasty Cynthia's foot when the latter stuck her tongue out at her when she left the party. I remember at 8 thinking, \\"Elizabeth, you don't need Cynthia.

This book, like his most famous book, &quot;Broken Cord,&quot; (his 1989 magnum  opus about his adopted son's challenges with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) gives  insight and voice to Native American traditions. His beautiful &quot;rite  of passage/naming ceremony&quot; brings to mind the parallel naming  ceremony of his son in &quot;Broken Cord.&quot; It is hard not to see some  parallels.  Mr. Dorris describes natural phenomena with love and respect  and that is resonated throughout this book.<br />In recent years, Mr. Dorris  was involved in a controversy and subsequently committed suicide.

Stupid.  Stupid, STUPID!  It is the cliche of twins who are obverse sides of each  other -- one good, one evil.  Madrigal, the evil twin naturally wants to  dispose of Mary-Lee, the goody-goody.  She convinces their naive parents  into sending Mary-Lee to boarding school, where the girl is miserable and  wants to come home.  Interestingly, Mary-Lee has no idea of how evil  Madrigal is until after Madrigal dies in a skiing accident when she  [Madrigal] comes to visit the boarding school. Mary-Lee was relegated to  the background while everybody flocked to her evil sister. Madrigal, in a  seeming change of heart (if she had one) suggested that she and her twin  switch snow suits when the group goes on a ski trip.  Madrigal dies, and  naturally everyone thinks it is Mary-Lee who is dead.  The girl's parents  enter into the charade only to admit that they knew Madrigal died all  along.  They admitted that they wanted to protect Mary-Lee and that sending  her away was to keep Madrigal from harming her.  Mary-Lee overheard them  saying in an earlier chapter that they regretted having twins and that if  one had to die, &quot;better it be this one,&quot; meaning Madrigal.  Don't  worry folks -- it all gets sorted out in the end.  There is no way for  those foolish parents to justify pretending that they thought Mary-Lee was  the dead twin.  That charade was not only stupid and unbelievable, it was  insulting to the readers' inteligence.  Madrigal's evil boy friend, Jon  Pear is a very unbelievable character - he eats Mary-Lee's tears, he swears  to be her twin in evil and the kids at the high school they attend all shy  away from him. Jon Pear is a completely laughable, ludicrous charcter that  adds nothing to this story.  It is like adding water to the soup - you have  more to consume, but are really taking in less.  He does nothing to  contribute to this stupid story.  Mary-Lee is laughably clueless to a  certain extent.ain extent.	2000-08-09

It is  and will remain a timeless classic.<br /><br />A salute to the author -- in recent  years I adopted a beagle from the shelter.  She, like Shiloh, had been  beaten and left to roam the streets.  Shiloh was loosely based on a dog  named \\"Clover\\" who, like Shiloh, was adopted into a loving home.  (There is a large female beagle in my neighborhood named Shiloh.  She's  beautiful).<br /><br />My beagle has been a pet therapy dog for senior citizens in a  nearby nursing home.  She has been great medicine for the folks there and  one nurse said she had gotten a beagle because she liked my dog.  She  couldn't think of a name for the dog, so I suggested \\"Clover,\\" in  honor of the literary Shiloh's real counterpart.  \\"Clover, like in a  good luck charm,\\" I said at the time.  I was delighted to learn days  later she named her hound  Clover.  Shiloh is a continuum of love.  It's  great.	2000-08-08

The  speeches give an excellent overview of the times and issues Robert Kennedy  was living in and his responses to same.  His frequent references to  classical literature not only serve to augment his points, but to include  the listener/reader in his knowledge base.  Robert Kennedy was a man who  was universally recognized as a diligent worker and one who not only set,  but met personal goals.  His determination was evidenced from the football  field (where he played with a broken leg in college to secure the coveted  Harvard letter) to the presidential platform, where he held his own with  some rather formidable competitors/opponents.  His knowledge of and  appreciation for classical literature is a true nod to his intelligence.  He became self-educated in adult life classical works.  He also became self  educated and personally involved in the lives and issues of minorities and  persons living below the poverty line.  The contrast between these areas of  his self education further emphasize the complexity of this man.  Robert  Kennedy  comes across as sincere in his efforts and his work record will  certainly support that finding.  Robert Kennedy was by far the most  interesting of the brothers of his generation and his work record was  exceptional in his tenacity and dogged determination.	2000-08-04

Hilty does a very thorough job of  portraying Robert Kennedy, the dedicated, hard working, determined brother,  warts in all in a fair and impartial way.  Throughout this book, one sees  the &quot;metamorphosis&quot; of Robert Kennedy.  He is the man who works  behind the scenes, protecting his brother's interests to his maximum  extent.  He is the man who pushes his brother forward while sublimating his  own interests, needs and identity. It is only in the tragic aftermath of  the President's death does Robert Kennedy, in full adult form emerge -- the  man who immersed himself in classical literature, the man who became a  personal crusader for civil rights related issues, the man who made it his  business to know minorities and persons living in poverty.  It is during  the last nearly half-decade of his life that the full face of Robert  Kennedy is shown to his constituents -- the man who doggedly pursued  Teamsters and Mafiosi in the 1950s takes that same dogged persistence to  the political arena where he runs on his own right.  He is a voice for the  disenfranchised, a voice for those who share his vision.  He was a man who  provided hope during a very turbulent period in history marked by war and  national violence.  It is the opinion of this reviewer that Robert Kennedy  is certainly the more interesting of the brothers.  His personal, political  and personality development is very interesting to watch and track.  He was  certainly a man who came across as very sincere in his efforts and one  cannot help wondering what the outcome today would be had this man lived.<br />This is a book well worth reading.	2000-08-04

He really does care  about people!&quot;  The man's unusually high level of committment is  readily apparent in his words.  He was obviously somebody who set and met  personal goals throughout his life -- in 1965 he climbed Mt. Kennedy,  although he was an acrophobe; in adult life he educated himself in  classical literature, thus increasing his knowlege base; he became  personally involved with minorities and persons living in poverty and made  these issues his own personal quest.  He made himself accessible to his  constituents and his works today serve as a model of a very committed man.  This is something worth having.	2000-08-03

Kennedy	Books	5	22	24	N	N	AN INSPIRATIONAL MAN's SOURCES OF INSPIRATION	Robert Kennedy was one of the most fascinating public figures in recent history.  He was clearly an intelligent man and he had the foresight to  combine that with hard work and effort.  It was only in adult life that he  became interested in classical literature and he used this interest to  become self-educated. That is one mark of high intelligence and  motivation.<br /><br />In reading the quotes that moved and motivated Robert  Kennedy, one can see the character development that was taking place during  his life during this period.  It was late in his life when he publicly  admitted that he \\"did not stay awake nights\\" worrying about  poverty and minorities.  Unlike so many public figures of that era, Robert  Kennedy personally got involved in these issues and as a result, developed  a very wide following.  A large part of his appeal lay in his sincerity --  one really got the feeling that he spoke straight from his heart, his gut,  his instincts.  My mother would  say that \\"Robert Kennedy is a man who cares about people.\\"<br /><br />I  became a history major and Robert Kennedy was the subject of my senior  project.  I read Camus, Tennyson, Sophocles, Plato and other literary  figures Robert Kennedy popularized in his speeches.  In so doing, I not  only gained a greater appreciation of classical literature, I also applied  that knowledge to my history paper. Indirectly, Robert Kennedy shaped my  academic career -- I have more than a pedestrian knowledge of classical  writings.  My senior sponsor loved the paper and it remains the thing I am  most proud of during my senior year.  Robert Kennedy was a realist, a man  for everyone and I honestly believe his hard work and awareness of human  rights have indeed left indelible stamps for the better in this world.<br /><br />(Just for the record, Douglas H. Kennedy was the Senator's youngest son  and not Matthew Maxwell Kennedy, the author).	2000-08-03

That poor girl lost her father to  suicide when she was eight and has a spoiled, goody-goody of a sister and a  mother who treats her like dirt.  I hate the way that stupid woman would  slap Chloris and talk against her to Princess Jenny.  I thought it was  disgusting the way that foolish woman told Jenny that &quot;Chloris was a  mean, rotten child&quot; when Chloris took off on a ski trip with some  friends without permission.  I didn't like Jenny from the get go, but my  dislike for her increased when she attacked Chloris when Chloris returned  from the trip.  The stupid mother put everything and everyone before  Chloris &quot;her friends,&quot; &quot;her house,&quot; and of course,  stupid, spoiled Jenny.  Poor Chloris had nothing to build esteem on.  No  inheritance, a father who committed suicide, a disgusting sister and mother  -- even rats take better care of their own.  This book is a real let down.	2000-08-03

Kennedy	Books	2	16	23	N	N	A Step Above a Tabloid	I bought this book thinking I was adding to my library of Robert Kennedy  materials.  Instead of being a serious critique or serious historical  analysis of his political career, it was little more than a tabloidesque  telling of his alleged adulterous affairs.  When a person is elected into  public office, that person is, in effect, being hired to do a job.  That  person's private life is not being hired.  I see no real purpose in  disclosing these alleged affairs and see nothing useful or constructive in  this. If the author's purpose was to discredit the work of Robert Kennedy  or trivialize him personally, he did not succeed.  I have always believed  Robert Kennedy was a man of strong character, a hard worker, sincere in his  efforts and committed to his visions.  I was really hoping for a serious  portrayal of the man who would be president.  Instead, I get what can most  gently be described as &quot;adult entertainment for those at the tabloid  level.&quot;  It really was a big disappointment.	2000-08-03

Andrews/Ghostwriter series do hold one's interest.  The books are like cotton candy -- appealing to look at, but leaving little of  substance. The formulaic Andrews is as follows:  1) Shadowy, sinister adult  females  2) Protagonist is always a young female with an  artistic talent (in Rain's case, acting)  3) Sooner or later  the protagonist has sexual  relationships prior to reaching  adulthood  4) a plethora of nature related metaphors  5)  a stupid expression in the books that has come  to irk me  personally -- &quot;putaway heart&quot;  6) Twins appear in most  of the Andrews/GW books  7) Incestuous relationships between  brother &amp; sister,  or people raised as brother and sister  --  (Cathy &amp; Chis), (Dawn &amp; Jimmy), (Heaven &amp; Tom  --  luckily they didn't take their relationship to  a sexual level), (Ruby &amp; Paul) and now Rain and Roy.

Chloris, the title character is a then 11-year-old coping with the suicide of her father some three years  earlier, a selfish mother who isn't even nice to her and her pampered  princess of a sister, Jenny.  Jenny narrates all the Chloris stories and  the favoritism the mother showers on Jenny is sickening.  Poor Chloris had  to contend with the fact that her father squandered her inheritance,  leaving her nothing while spoiled little Jenny gets it all.  The stupid  mother slaps Chloris and treats her like dirt whenever she is angry at her  which is frequent.  She never seems to relate postively to Chloris and  appears to be conditioned to disapprove of anything connected with her.  A  must miss.	2000-08-03

Ms. Shriver does a  superb job of reassuring and reaffirming the art of claiming one's  identity.  I like the way she underscores her point that external  credentials does not a good or successful person make and that one's real  gains are made are in meeting self improvement goals. Ms. Shriver has  successfully managed to bypass the &quot;commas&quot; in her life identity,  e.g., wife of/daughter/cousin/niece/granddaughter of and be what she really  is: Maria Shriver, successful news reporter, mother, wife, author, human  being and realist who knows how to compartmentalize her life and meet  reasonable goals.  This book is especially comforting during major set  backs in one's life as well, e.g. changing jobs or moving. It is truly a  book that I would recommend to ANYONE.  It helps raise one's awareness and  it encourages empathy. Kudos to Maria Shriver!	2000-08-03

He has drawn a very real, very strong  portrait of a man who set and met many personal goals in his personal and  professional life. Robert Kennedy was, in my opinion the most interesting  of his brothers.  Mr. O'Donnell does an excellent job of describing the  aura of sincerity Robert Kennedy exuded.  He helps bring a man into focus  who has been dead for many years by describing the consistencies of his  character.  Robert Kennedy was clearly a very driven, very determined and  very  hard working man.  He was also a very caring, very committed and very  compassionate as well.  He was a central figure in world history and I  think the late Senator's works have certainly influenced the world for the  better.  This book is definitely worth reading.	2000-08-02

Kara, the central character in this story is a large, powerful falcon.  He is a predator by nature, devouring  smaller creatures. During one attack, he swoops down on a dove.  The dove  begs for her life and when Kara looks into her eyes and sees her fear, he  relents and releases her.  From then on, Kara changes his priorities.  He  learns to eat berries and vegetables because he can no longer bring himself  to kill another living creature.  The gentle dove in turn, welcomes Kara  into the woodland creatures' community where they bond and welcome even  more animals of all species.<br />Kara is a symbol for St. Paul, the former  Saul known for his persecution of Christians.  The gentle dove is a symbol  of the Angel who appeared to Paul and who helped him rethink his priorities  and become a Christian.  (The dove, long recognized as the symbol of peace  is often referred to in Scripture). The woodland creatures could be the  Disciples or as a Christian community of caring.  The end of the book  reinforces the Christian theme beautifully by describing Kara's ultimate  sacrifice -- he eats Manna (communion, perhaps) and takes a swan song  (falcon song) flight into the sun.  At the end of his life, he is  transformed into a myriad of beautiful colors that his woodland friends  know as being him.  It is one of best books in Christian literature.  It is  a heart warmer.  Please read it.  It will really touch your heart.	2000-08-02

Prior to reading this book, I did not know about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effect (FAS/FAE).  Mr. Dorris gives a  good overview of this tragic condition and his references throughout this  book certainly augment the points he makes.  I like the lyrical tone Abel's  (called \\"Adam\\" in the book) story takes when the author includes  references to nature and natural phenomena.  This book is also culturally  enriching by providing glimpses of Native American traditions, e.g. Adam's  naming ceremony and the gatherings the Dorris family takes later in the  book.<br /><br />Two things saddened me deeply about this book in addition to  Adam's congenital condition. The author was involved in a very unfortunate  controversy and committed suicide in 1997. In 1991 Adam, then 23 was run over by a  car and killed.  It made for a very tragic postcript to the lives of the  Dorris family and to all those who cared about them personally.	2000-08-02

I found myself much more interested in Robert Kennedy, the  Attorney General - Senator. Since he worked closely with his brother, it is  impossible to write about him without including President Kennedy and his  input.<br />Robert Kennedy was, in my opinion the more interesting of the two.  In addition to having a more extensive legal background, he was plainly a  man who set and met personal goals.  He was dogged and determined and his  hard work yielded success.  From football to ferreting out teamsters and  mafiosi, Robert Kennedy exemplified the meaning of persistence.  He was  certainly a very sympathetic figure in history and I have always believed  that he sincerely cared about people.  I remember when I was a very little  girl I would see him on the evening news with a group of neighborhood kids  who were drawn tho him like metal filings to a magnet.  I remember  thinking, &quot;he really does care.&quot;  My mother took me into the  voting booth when he ran for office and I am proud to say that I am the  youngest person who voted for him.  She used to say that &quot;Senator  [Robert] Kennedy is a man who cares about people.&quot;  I believed that.  From elementary school to college, he was the historical figure I chose to  research and write about when given the chance to decide.  My college  senior project was &quot;Robert Kennedy:  A Contemporary Figure&quot; and  it was the best paper I ever wrote. My then senior sponsor lauded it and I  think today that it was my interest in the subject and my beliefs that made  it a good work.  In response to the paper I wrote then, I still say that  Robert Kennedy is a prominent figure in history who is certainly relevant  now.  This book is a keeper.	2000-08-02

When I was three years old, my mother took me into the election booth to vote for him when he was running  for Senate. &quot;Push the button that says 'Robert Kennedy'and then pull  the lever,&quot; she instructed me.  I did and she told me that I had just  voted.  Whenever we saw him on the evening news, she would say proudly,  &quot;And YOU voted for him.&quot;  It was one of the proudest moments of  my life.  As a very young child, I remember my mother telling me that  &quot;Senator [Robert] Kennedy is a man who cares about people,&quot; and  would then relate his work with minorities, the poor and with children in  particular.  I loved Robert Kennedy!  I thought he was sincere, brave (he  dared to care about others) and the account of his climbing Mt. Kennedy in  March of 1965 remains a favorite story to this day.  Robert Kennedy was a  man who was described as &quot;acrophobic,&quot; but he tabled his terror  and climbed that mountain out of love for his brother. (I think it should  be called &quot;Bobby's Mountain&quot; as he was the man who claimed it).   Upon reaching the top of the mountain, Robert Kennedy gave credit where it  was due by  making the Sign of the Cross.  That is one of the most  inspirational stories I have ever come across and I have actually used that  story (&quot;I call it 'Bobby's Mountain'&quot;) when I've had to give  certain types of talks before the Toastmasters.  I was a history major and  my senior project was on Robert Kennedy.  He was truly a man of integrity,  personal strength and character.  He is an excellent example of how  persistence pays and is a very prominent figure in history.  I have the  deepest respect for this man.	2000-08-02

In &quot;The Broken Cord,&quot;  which was about his son, Abel (called &quot;Adam&quot; in this book), the  horror of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effect is brought to light.  This book is  typical Dorris.  It is lyrical, beautifully written and includes a nod to  the wonders of nature. It is not so much the biography of an otherwise not  well known person, it is an awareness of that person and his place in the  environment.  As upsetting as the controversy and subsequent death of Mr.  Dorris was, he was still an exceptional author and this book, like his  others is proof of it.	2000-08-02

I have loved this book since I was a child. It is a fascinating portrayal of life in Holland during the Second World War. It is replete with Dutch customs, such as the significance of the different positions of windmill blades. I really enjoyed the description of the Dutch Christmas with \\"Sinterklaas.\\" It helps to put a human face on those who suffered during the war. The central characters take in a child whose family was captured by Nazis and raise her along with their children. The description of how Trixie's foster mother teaches her to respond to her natural mother when they are reunited at the end of the war will warm one's heart. The real heroes are \\"Kees Kip,\\" who might be loosely based on Wallenberg, a humanitarian now famous for saving the lives of many during the war. It is a wonderful book. Please read it.	2000-08-02

One laughs with Peter and Patsy, who seem more like  twins than siblings 2 years apart and I like the way they formed their own  unit.  Joan brought a voice of &quot;youthful maturity&quot; which  certainly brought a smile to my face.  This is really a wonderful book.  I'm glad I have it.

He was a good man and his track record in minority work certainly underscores this point.  I have  always believed he was sincere in his efforts and that he truly cared about  people.  He was of an usual caliber and his loss was certainly one that was  keenly felt.  I can to this very day remember those two horrendous days in  June when he was assassinated and later died.  It was the first death that  ever affected me personally.  I was then a child and I remember saying that  &quot;I hate the man who shot Senator Kennedy!  I hate him and I hope they  throw him in jail forever and I wish Rosey Grier had broken his [the  assassin's] head!&quot;  My mother gave me some sound advice that I  remember today. Her exact words to me on June 6, 1968 were, &quot;Senator  Kennedy would not want you to hate anyone.  Instead of hating the assassin,  pray instead for an end to violence and pray for his family.&quot;  It took  me some time before I was able to do that, and I am glad to be able to say  today that I can.  Over the years, I have prayed for David, the son who  watched his own father die on television and was so consumed with his own  grief that he, too, became a casualty. One of my all time favorite stories  about Robert Kennedy was his success in climbing Mt. Kennedy in Canada in  March of 1965.  He was a man whom many described as acrophobic, yet he was  able to table his terror and climb that mountain out of love for his  brother. (I think the mountain should have been named after ROBERT Kennedy  -- he claimed it).  He wisely gave credit where credit was due upon  reaching the top of that mountain -- he made the Sign of the Cross.  I just  love this story so much that I have told it before the Toastmasters.  I  think it is very inspiring and just underscores the character,  determination and hard work of a man who worked hard to meet personal  goals. Robert Kennedy was in my eyes a success story.

In addition to being one of the saddest books I have ever read, it is also one of the most beautiful books I have ever read.  Dave has consistently  survived the most extreme forms of abuse (his story makes Dickens'  fictional accounts of abuse sound tame by comparison) and come out a  winner.  He is truly a Godsend, a gift and the voice of inspiration for  many.  He is living proof that abusive cycles can be broken.  That  hackneyed excuse about abusers having been abused themselves is a dodge and  a cop out for irresponsible behavior. Not all abuse survivors perpetuate a  defeatist cycle.  Dave didn't and I don't think Dave is unique.  Common  sense, a conscience and pleasure in enriching people's lives certainly  occupy the forefront of my mind.  Dave appears to have made that same  priority heard and felt in his works. Dave wisely made that decision and it  has really taken him far.  As for Dave, KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!  It would  be an honor and a pleasure to hear this incredible person speak.	2000-08-02

These stories cannot be recommended highly enough.  Dr. Rubin clearly cares about his patients and the characters he has based on them.  His compassion shines through  like a beacon.  These books are not to be missed.<br />David, a gifted  neurotic, compulsive boy meets the psychotic Lisa in a residential  treatment center.  He masks his obvious attraction to the girl by claiming  to be clinically interested in her.  She speaks in rhyme to suppress her  &quot;alter ego,&quot; identified as Muriel.  David unlocks the riddle of  why Lisa speaks in nonsense rhymes and from that point on, he makes  incredible progress. His psychiatrist, Dr. White and Lisa's teacher, John  are compassionate characters one can't help but love.<br />Jordi really  touched my heart.  I first read &quot;Jordi&quot; when I was 11 and it  remains a favorite book to this day. Jordi was a very bright boy who lived  in Brooklyn.  He knew all the train and bus routes in the tri-state area  and at 8, had not learned any academic skills. Jordi is clearly  schizophrenic and his mental illness makes him confused about what is real  and what is fantasy.  He fears garbage pails because he thinks the opening  is an ear that can hear him.  He fears rain forests because he thinks trees  will land from the sky onto him.<br />Jordi did not fit into any mainstream  program and he was lucky his  parents had the foresight not to commit him  to an institution.  That was just too inhuman.  Luckily for Jordi, a day  school opened in his area and he was admitted. I loved the way he and his  teacher, Sally, worked with each other.  Lisa makes a guest appearance in  this book with her teacher, John.  They, too, help Jordi in that he learns  that he is not the one being hurt when he sees Lisa kicking John in anger  one day.  Sally helped Jordi shed many of his misperceptions and I loved  the way she and Jordi demolished a garbage can.  She encouraged Jordi to  identify anger and to vent it onto that can.  By doing this, she allowed  Jordi to explain his fear and she, in turn could tell him that garbage cans  are inanimate and can't hear.  She helped Jordi over many hurdles including  academic work.  It warmed my heart to read about Jordi's rapid progress in  reading and in acquiring advanced mathematic skills.  I loved the way Sally  helped orient Jordi by showing him that he would always be Jordi regardless  of which seat he occupied or what coat he wore or what changes occurred in  his routines. She clearly accepted this boy and it is through their good  work together that Jordi was able to break from the bond of psychotic  confusion into health and social/world participation.

There is not a single character you can like except for the peripheral adult characters. Emlyn is a thoroughly obnoxious, unpleasant and completely implausible character.  She is a stupid girl who has a stupid  fantasy -- stealing the mummy.  The kids who join her in this museum heist  are equally detestable -- they not only threaten Emlyn, but they insist on  sharing the booty they feel the mummy will yield.  It has a slightly  macabre twist -- the concept of grave robbing is always daunting at best,  revolting at worst and yet the young marauders get off scot free. I wish  Emlyn had been punished to the fullest extent of the law and her band of  accomplices along with her. I hated Emlyn and found her to be a very  unsympathetic character.  I didn't like the book and felt the story was a  complete bust.  I'd like to see Emlyn entombed, never to be resurfaced.	2000-07-31

It gave an excellent description of physical therapy and the different types of CP. It was a very informative book and I was impressed with the author's strong knowledge base and  literary references.<br /><br />However, I was perturbed by the author's saying she  would rather have Jimmy (the husband) than the two girls (Marie and infant  Karen). The other thing that bothered me was when the author told Karen,  then 6, who understandably was tired during one of her intense therapy  sessions that &#34;God loved her so much he wanted her to suffer like  Jesus.&#34; As a cradle Catholic, I just can't let that go unchallenged.  God does not want anybody to suffer, His own begotten Son or any of His  other children.  Karen unfortunately suffered some sort of brain damage in  utero (most likely) that resulted in cerebral palsy.  She was well provided  for -- she had a literary mother who made her famous, she had superior  intelligence, she had loving siblings and a passel of pets. She was lucky  in that she had a doctor who went to bat for her at an early age by  recognizing her intelligence and telling her parents that she &#34;needed  help and a great deal of it&#34; and for providing the Killileas with  options to have Karen treated for C.P. (God bless that doctor)! I<br /><br />In response  to Karen's understandable displeasure with the button boards and her  physically grueling routine, instead of telling her God wanted her to  suffer (which certainly does a major disservice to God), it might have been  better to say something like &#34;God is working with you and you have made a lot of  improvements.  Let's pray together for more improvement,&#34; or &#34;let's pray  together for good work,&#34; or &#34;God is cheering you on!  He had  helped you come this far. Keep up the good work.&#34;  That one part notwithstanding, it was a well written book. I recommend [[ASIN:039444342X Run Away, Little Girl]] instead of this book.  The Siegels don't portray themselves as saints, martyrs and masochists.  They show their real faces, warts and all in raising 5 children.  Debbie Siegel, 20 years younger than Karen is their youngest child and fortunately had doors open to her and options that were not available during Karen's formative years.  What  makes Debbie's story so much more effective although it did not get the accolades that the Karen books did is that it is a book people can relate to.  It is about how a family experienced and explored feelings and options without resorting to moralistic platitudes.  I much preferred Siegel's book.ay themselves as saints, martyrs and masochists.

This is one of the most beautiful collection of stories I have ever read. I first read &quot;Lisa &amp; David&quot; when I was 11 and I thoroughly enjoyed the poetic description of the residential treatment center these  young people were in and the way they reached each other. David, a gifted  boy was instrumental in reaching Lisa. He was the one who figured out why  she spoke in rhymes -- she did that to suppress her alter ego, Muriel. (She  was a schizophrenic girl who believed she had a second personality).  David  and her teacher John were the ones who were able to recognize glimpses of  intelligence in the girl and David's pyschiatrist, Dr. White was an  unusually kind man.  He and David were good for each  other.<br />&quot;Jordi&quot; was a book that completely bowled me over.  I  first read it at 11 and was captivated.  The only real complaint I could  make is that it is too short.  I LOVED THIS BOOK!  It gave a lyrical voice  to the inner torment of Jordi's psychosis.  Jordi was a very appealing boy.  He was certainly very bright in that he knew all the train and bus routes  in the tri-state area and he learned to read and to calculate complex  mathematical equations quickly.  I was so glad Jordi's parents were too  smart to leave him in an institution.  That would have been just too  inhuman. Jordi was lucky in that he was accepted at a day program wherein  he found an unusually gifted teacher, Sally.  I like the way they worked  together and I really loved the way Sally and Jordi demolished a garbage  can together to prove to Jordi that garbage cans &quot;did not really have  ears&quot; and that they were simply inanimate objects.  I love the way  they related to each other. Sally helped Jordi define his own boundaries  when she explained to him that when another teacher was being kicked by an  angry pupil, he, Jordi was not the one who was being hurt.  She further  helped Jordi recognize himself when she proved that he was still Jordi, no  matter what seat he sat in or whose coat he wore.  I really love this book.

This book is a very disturbing story about sheer irresponsibility and its dire consequences.  The victims and families of the perpetrators are the only sympathetic characters. I detested Remy and found her to be an overly  dramatic, irresponsible and self centered character. I didn't like her  mother and felt those two deserved each other.   I also was quite perturbed  about Remy's brother having never been named. That really bothered me. That  is another example of a lack of regard for human life, human identity and  sheer irresponsibility.  Remy and her foolish mother were two dodo birds of  a feather that flew together.

Any follower of VC Andrews knows that her protagonist always has a talent (Cathy Dollanger, the dancer, the aptly named Melody, the musician and now Rain, the actor).   I thought it was good having an interracial character  to help add a new element to the tired themes of incest, of sexual  relationships with persons raised as sibligs only to learn they are not  true siblings (Heaven/Tom, Dawn/Jimmy and now Rain/Roy).  I had hoped Rain  would have better sense than to sleep with Roy.  It has been a cheapened,  tired cliche.  I really hoped for something a little different.  If  anything, this series is equal opportunity -- looking on the bright side,  it shows that irresponsible sex and tired cliches apply across the board.  Rain was a let down like the disillusioning Cathy before her.   VC Andrews  books are soap operas that hold one's interest, yet offer little of  substance.  I sure hope Rain end up another cliche like all of VC Andrews'  other characters with the exception of the Runaways.  That was her best  series (the Runaways).	2000-07-25

Although I enjoyed to some degree the psychological portrait of the man, I was very perturbed by the author's contention that the Attorney General in any way engineered his  brother's death.  To suggest such a thing is to suggest pure madness as RFK  was absolutely devoted to his brother and often sublimated his own identity  during his Attorney General years so as to better serve his brother.  I  found that concept preposterous and completely without merit.  Robert  Kennedy was the only one of the brothers that I liked and I believed he had  a lot of personal integrity, moral conviction and certainly a brave one.  He met personal goals and was an extremely hard worker who had a lot to  show for his efforts.  In some way I feel this book trivialized his  political career. Robert Kennedy is an interesting man in his own right and  I think much more interesting than any of his brothers.  I really felt  somewhat disappointed in this book.	2000-07-25

I didn't like her irrational behavior, e.g. renting fleabags, sleeping in the park on Halloween and the way she treated Jennifer. She would deliberately do dangerous things like hitchhinking. I hated the way she talked to Jennifer. Gail had such an inappropriate way of relating in general. I think it served her right that Jennifer left to move in with her dad.<br /><br />I think buying a BIRTHday cake for a DEAD person is sick and macabre. Gail actually bought a BIRTHday cake for Cindy after her death. That was stupid and sickening and I didn't like that part at all. Gail was sick and macabre.<br /><br />I also disliked Gail's shallow, self-centered friend Nancy.  That character was irritating, vain and cared only about herself and her inane palaver was as annoying as she was.<br /><br />I didn't like the way Gail treated Cindy, the daughter who was killed during her music lessons. I also didn't like the way she sank to Cindy's level when she played dolls with her. Destroying the \\"happy plates\\" Cindy liked seemed stupid because one would think she would want something to remember that the child enjoyed. I also did not like the way she told the psychiatrist (he and Jack were saints) she would not let him help her. I hated the ending and thought Gail was for the birds.	2000-07-24

There is nothing to sustain an adult's interest and I am not the only  child to have found it very frightening.  It was upsetting that the kind driver did everything he could for that personified hunk of junk (on page one, he stopped so he could  get water for it).

He has barricaded himself under a table and his voice had been unheard since his admission to the place when he was seven.<br /><br />In time, Kevin is drawn out from under the table and begins using materials provided during therapy sessions to free himself from his internal torment.  Kevin, described as a skilled artist, used drawing to present events that took place early in his life.  In time, Kevin begins to speak and he discloses an early life replete with brutality and horror; he and his sisters were sexually abused and beaten by their stepfather and one younger sister was beaten to death.  Kevin and this sister were especially close and it is through dogged determination that the child's school, death and social services records are unearthed.  The girl had been \\"buried\\" twice: the first time when she was killed and the second time when the social services bureaucratic agencies involved in Kevin's case felt that disclosure of the child's murder would preclude him from being viewed objectively.  This reasoning seems bizarre and is never explained.<br /><br />Kevin's natural expression was often poignant; in one passage, he talks of \\"mirror-ghosts;\\" people who have, in his words died of \\"heart rot\\" because they have never been loved.  The song \\"Where is Love\\" from \\"Oliver!\\" would be the song to underscore a good portion of this book.<br /><br />Kevin's progress accelerates; he learns to swim over the summer after some setbacks; he works with another child who is part of the Big Sister/Big Brother program and the pair appear to work well together; by fall of that year, Kevin was given a clean bill of health and promoted to a group home.  Sadly, this is a short lived success after Kevin breaks a worker's arm after the latter tells him he can never be normal.  The boy then serves the better part of 10 months in a hospital.  Once released, he is assigned to a boys' ranch, which did not sound like the place to meet his needs.<br /><br />Over time, after contending with inappropriate placements and setbacks, Kevin is welcomed into a group home where he can serve as a mentor to his dorm mates.

It is truly a work of art and I love the way you can &quot;suspend&quot; reality by e-mailing the characters!  I love the &quot;interactive&quot; forum of the strip and I really love the character of Jim, a savvy senior citizen who brings in some sharp insights.  It is past time for seniors to get positive press and I'm glad to see it happen in this book!  THREE CHEERS FOR THIS BOOK!  END	2000-07-12

She is by far and away the best illustrator and story teller ever to hit the funny pages.  She's great!  Her courage in portraying homosexuality, death, and adult themed issues,  e.g. divorce and business is to be applauded.  Her characters are all  convincing and believable, and with the exception of obnoxious, spoiled  April, truly delightful.	2000-07-11

This book has yielded a rich crop of great stories. The cast is certainly a convincing one.  They are all folks one can recognize from real life counterparts, from funny, savvy Mr. Jim Patterson to the spoiled, unplesant  April. She's the only one I have never been able to like.   (I don't know  how she gets by with her mouth.  I'm surprised nobody ever put their foot  down to her and she takes advantage of everybody.  April is the weed  growing in the garden)!  It was good reconnecting with Gordon, who is a  sterling success story (from the poor boy who was often picked on and who  lived with domestic violence to the successful entrepreneur -- you go,  Gordon)! Lawrence, too, was an added treat as his orientation has helped  pave the way for acceptance of gays among his &quot;real&quot;  counterparts. Love the book!  It was great, as I expected it would be.	2000-07-11

This delightful collection of a very high caliber strip does not disappoint.  The strip boasts of a delightful cast of characters with the exception of obnoxious April, who is the sole weed growing in the comic's  Garden of Eden.  This book will not disappoint loyal FBOFW followers,  myself included.	2000-07-10

Nobody in cartoon history has created such delightful (save for April with her fresh mouth) and believable characters. Nobody else has been brave enough to confont issues like breast  exams, death of family members and loss of pets as well as homosexuality.   It is a brave new look at a superior caliber of comics that is more than  just a comic.<br />HATS OFF TO LYNN JOHNSTON!	2000-07-10

It is one of the best drawn books I ever read. Nobody is anywhere as good a cartoonist as Lynn Johnston.  I wish somebody would put a muzzle on  April. She has a big  mouth and I wish  she'd keep her feet in it because she keeps saying the wrong things at the  wrong times to the wrong people. April is a Pest with a capital P-E-S-T.   She's the weed that is in the title.  It's time to call the gardener.	2000-07-08

A GENTLE PORTRAYAL OF LIVES	This absolutely delightful book gives a very interesting overview of the  development, thought and care that went into creating these high caliber,  sympathetic and very believable characters.  I have known Lawerences,  Gordons and Sharons. I am so delighted to find their &quot;cartoon&quot;  counterparts vividly portrayed in this book.  Lynn Johnston is not only a  very gifted artist, but she is a wonderful realist and is truly skilled at  maintaining her readers' interest.  There is no cartoonist I have read to  date who is in her league.  Like the title of the 1992 baseball movie, she  really is in a &quot;league of her own.&quot;  Kudos to this wonderful book  and it was the very first book I ever bought on line! (I bought all her  other books at the store). THREE CHEERS FOR THIS BOOK!	2000-07-07

It was a very realistic, moving series of stripsthat dealt with death in a humane and compassionate as well asbelievable way.<br />The only negative comment I could make is that I just can't like April.  I tried, but like a reader named becca71, I think April is a spoiled brat who is never disciplined and who goes out of her way to rile people.  Although I don't approve of Jeremy's bullying tactics, April DID ask for it by singing that cruel song and for making obnoxious comments.  I don't like the way poor Liz took the heat everytime bratty April got into something.  I don't like the way April hogged the bathroom and impacted on Liz' time to get ready.  I think April is a capital brat who has not a clue what &quot;no&quot; means and who is just a spoiled, silly, self-indulged little princess. Becca71 was right.	2000-07-07

Rain, the newest protagonist revisits all of these themes and  parallel concepts by having an aptitude for acting and by having feelings  for her half brother.  The only departure from the Cliche Andrews or  vintage Andrews, if you will, is that this is the first interracial  character.  That adds an interesting new element.	2000-06-28

Wilma is foolish, fatuous and even more shallow that a child size spoon. I found this book to be a stupid fairy tale that does not even share the category  of humorous spoofs like the &quot;Princess&quot; series.  At least those  books were funny.  This book is just an inane fairy tale and Wilma is just  a stupid, selfish girl with no thought of action-consequence. She is a very  unappealing protagonist who has not a shred of common sense.  Why on earth  would anybody bring a dog to somebody's house, particularly if the dog was  apt to urinate indoors?  That is but one example of what an inconsiderate,  plodding, inept drone Wilma and those wretched girls really are. I just  cannot understand how anybody could like this book. That is baffling.	2000-06-27

It is a wonderful book and will prove helpful to people not only coming to  terms with the death of a loved one, but for folks who want a comforting  way of describing death to a very young child or for someone seeking  comfort during the loss of a loved one.  It is a very special book that  will remain in the hearts of readers.  It is a book that belongs on the  shelf and in the mind and heart of all persons.  This book is exceptional.	2000-06-05
