It revolves around the lives of an Italian family in New York in the 1950s and i found it to be very enticing and easy to read...once i started, i couldn't put it down!!!!! While I would love to see another Ave Maria installation...i give Adriana a thumbs-up for this novel!!!!!	2003-09-21

I was very excited to start &quot;What the lady wants&quot; due to the fact that i have always adored Jennifer Crusie's writing.....this book, however, left alot to be desired for me.  I found the plot to be rather dull and lifeless and found myself struggling to finish it.  The plot dragged on and on and never gave any excitement. Better stick to some of her previous titles for total excitement.	2003-09-21

Johnny Angel is one of those books you can read in one sitting......quite the good read.....definitely a bit far-fetched, but good nonetheless.

After reading all of DS books....I finally happened upon one that DOESNT sound just like all the rest of them.  Yes - Paris' husband leaves and yes- she tries to pick up the pieces, but this book not only had a dramatic ending, it didnt leave me bored halfway through. The twist on the plot was refreshing, and the addition of Paris' children kept it moving at a good pace.	2003-03-26

Nontheless...i enjoyed all the characters, especially Sarah, Hunter's daughter.  Nora has come very far since she wrote these 2 books.  True...some of her newer efforts, including 3 Sisters Trilogy have been greatly improved.  I recommend these 2 books. I will next be diving into Time and Again.	2002-12-28

It wasnt the greatest, as a matter of fact, it was my LEAST favorite of the series.  I agree with the reviewer who said that she wanted more Ranger and Joe and less Valerie and her kids.  I truly enjoy all the shenanigans of Grandma Mazur...and even she was missing through most of the book.  I didn't find myself laughing aloud quite as much as I'd have liked to.  I think Janet should incorporate more of Steph's romantic life in her next book and kill off all bears, rabbits, etc.	2002-07-11

It's one of those books that leaves a bit to the imagination...which is a good thing in this day and age of countless novels and beach reads.  Cannie was one of the strongest female roles I've ever encountered in my book travels.  Bruce was a loser...plain and simple.

While I really enjoyed Nell, Suze and Margie...I sure could have done without Gabe and Riley and their daily business dealings.  I think if this book would have been written primarily about the &quot;girls&quot; it would have been much more engrossing for me.  I especially adored Marlene...bless her heart!!!!

I tended to feel like smacking Dani and Logan a few times to put some sense into them.  I, too, have been in a similar situation and know how hard it is to let go.  I'm glad the ending happened as it did.......predictably...of course!!!!	2001-05-09

This book was good but I definitely prefer &quot;Sis Boom Bah&quot; and &quot;Name Dropping&quot; instead.  Lynn was a real go-getter in this story.  I feel bad for what Penny put her through but she comes out on top anyway.  I am looking forward to more Jane Heller reads in the future.	2001-05-02

I was, however, pleasantly surprised.  I didn't want to suffer through another version of &quot;No Greater Love.&quot;  I am not one for books written in the past instead of the present, but this book was extremely good and kept my attention for hours at a time.  Kate was extremely loyal to Joe and I can identify with her in most instances.  She never gave up hope and her dreams came true.  I highly recommend this book to all DS fans.	2001-04-24

I can't say that I didn't like &quot;Jimmy&quot;s Girl.&quot;  I did like it for the most part...but.....I didn't like the fact that I had to read the same thing 2 chapters in a row.  Hearing it once is good enough for me.	2001-04-10

I loved all the books in this series and I think this one may be my favorite.  The reason behind that may be the fact that Kate goes after Brody instead of vice-versa.  Most of the stories Nora writes have the main character being pursued by some love-sick man.  This one was a stroke of genius for sure.  I loved Jack and thought it was extremely cute how he asked Kate to &quot;marry&quot; him.  I can hardly wait for the next installment due in July.	2001-03-27

I read &quot;Convincing Alex&quot; about 2 yrs. ago and loved it.  Bu t...I have to agree with the reviewer who said that &quot;Luring a Lady&quot; is better.  Mikhail was strong-willed and stubborn and his love interest...Sydney, was cold as ice.   Reminds me alot of myself.   This family is definitely one I'd love to meet.  Such a close-knit family with plenty of kids to liven things up.	2001-03-16

I really enjoyed &quot;Girl Talk.&quot;  However...I did find it hard to keep up with the author because she was constantly changing the time frame of the story.  Don't get me wrong....I did like this book alot...especially Ruby and Jacko.  Lissy and Church are a couple of goofs at age 15 and Piper was a brat.  I wish this book was longer to let the reader find out about the birth of Lissy's child.  I do hope that she and Church make it...and I certainly hope for a sequel!!!!	2001-03-12

I like Nora Roberts ALOT.....she's one of my favorites...but this book didn't even make the cut for a good book.  I'd say it was a decent read...but not up to snuff with her other more recent books.  I guess when they say you get better with age is true!!!!  Aurora is not a normal 28 yr. old women.  She dabbles in the paranormal behavior....as does her mother, Clarissa.....and fights tooth and nail to keep herself away from David Brady.  Needless to say....this was not a great read.	2001-03-01

When Deborah O'Roarke encounters trouble...she usually also encounters Nemesis.  After she starts seeing rich man Gage, Deborah still seems to run into Nemesis, until Gage reveals the shocking truth.  She is then torn between what she feels and what she knows.

At first I didn't know what to make of &quot;Wish You Well.&quot;  I felt bad for OZ and Lou, but didn't know what the life w/ their great-grandma would bring.  I was surprised and delighted by the whole story.  I especially missed the antics of Diamond Skinner.  He seemed to be the meat in the sandwich.  I was happy for the two kids at the end.....Everything wasn't coming up roses.... but it wasn't all bad.	2001-02-21

Don't get me wrong...I love Steve Martin.  &quot;Shopgirl&quot;...well...I won't say I love it because it would be lying.  I found it to be an average read.  I'm an avid fiction reader and have spent many worthwhile hours reading tasty tidbits.  This wasn't a Hostess Twinkie by any means.....more so a little  extra cheese on your burger.  Mirabelle was an underdeveloped wallflower and her beau, Ray was a sloth.  Jeremy was the only person in this book to spark any interest on my part.	2001-02-15

Wow.....I read it in under 3 days!!!!!  Tracie knew what she wanted....she just didn't see it right in front of her face.  Her loser boyfriend, Phil and her best friend, Laura weren't of much help to her at all.  Jon is at the hands of fate with  Tracie.......until she creates a monster and has to knock him down a few pegs.   And.....lo and behold....loser Phil tries to make a turnaround a day late and a dollar short.  Tracie is torn between her job, her man, and her  soon-to-be exfriend, Jon.  I laughed so hard at some places that I almost fell off my couch!!!!  This book was soooo great.....maybe Olivia could write a sequel called...&quot;Bad Girl!&quot;	2001-02-13

Sure...this book is a quick read and may hold one's attention for a bit....but it lacks alot of the emotion from some of her other releases.  Riley was stubborn and somewhat selfish and so was Brin.  It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth as far as endings.  I will continue to read all of Sandra's books in the future because she has alot of talent.	2001-02-10

As anyone can tell you...being threatened or stalked is creepy...very much so!!!  &quot;Night Shift&quot; showed all the aspects of being threatened plus an added bonus: romance.  Of course Nora Roberts put in a little romance for her romance fans along with the suspense for her J.D. Robb fans.  I just wish I had a cute cop like Boyd Fletcher in my life!!!!!  Although... I have no reason to need protection!	2001-01-30

The characters of June and Bea were likable enough but Shelley was perhaps my favorite..  I had a bit of trouble keeping the characters straight at some point, but it was an enjoyable book nonetheless.  The relationship between Shelley and Bill baffled me and Bill kind of annoyed me in the fact that he tried to date Bea, June, and Shelley  throughout his 70 yrs. of life.  Kind of strange for a man who was married and had a bunch of kids.  Bill seemed to be the thrill of the three main female characters in this book.  I can perhaps see a vision of him...but the big picture cannot be seen through my eyes at all. I would recommend this to a friend.	2000-12-14

I found it kind of hard to follow and identify with the characters.  Theresa was the hardest nut to crack.  Christine wasn't all that unstable as they made her out to be.  She just needed to get away from James and live her own life.  This book was good..don't get me wrong...but it was hard for me to follow.	2000-10-05

Nancy Stern and her nemesis Nancy Stern both live in the same building.  A surprise Christmas gift sends the unpopular Nancy Stern into a threatening situation.  Her boyfriend is hiding a secret job and the other Nancy Stern is killed.  This book is not your typical fiction and I do believe that is what kept me so interested.	2000-09-26

I prefer romance written by Sandra  Brown a whole lot better.  This book started out ok but mid-way through  became extremely tedious for me to read.  It was not until the end that  things really picked up.  I guess I'm just used to SB romance novels and  cannot get into these mystery books.  I agree with the reviewer from  MO....I'll stick to romance.	2000-09-18

Just the right blend of love and humor to keep me amused.  Julie Roseman was a divorced mother with her  feet on the ground until Romeo Cacciamani comes floating into her life.  At  the threat of being disowned by their families, the two weather the snide  remarks, fistfights and business battles.  I have to say that Plummy was my  favorite person in this book.	2000-08-11

I'm not saying that Dana was odd for getting the operation, just that the whole book struck me as odd.  I  could not remember who was talking in each chapter, therefor I would have  to go back to the beginning to check.  Allison was purely STUPID to think  that she and Dana could just &quot;pick-up&quot; where they left off!    WRONG!   What made her think she would be happy with a female Dana minus a  penis?   She was not a lesbian. That was probably  her biggest attraction  to Dana in the first place.  Dana turned out to be mostly selfish and I'm  almost astonished at the fact that she decided she liked men after all.   The one I felt sorry for was Patricia.  She clearly lost out on a good man  when Will turned to Allison and Dana.	2000-08-09

Jessup seemed to fall into  the wrong hands with Reg and Marigold, thus learning a life lesson the hard  way.  Marigold was one tough cookie and her husband was a total waste.  If  he didn't want to work then he shouldn't be terrorizing other people who  do.  I admire Marigold's strength and perserverance.  She did the right  thing at the end of the book.  Jessup needed to open his eyes and see just  how bad his connection with Reg really was.  The fair scene hit too close  to home.  This book left me with a feeling of incompleteness.	2000-08-03

Liz loses Jack in the blink of an eye and her whole life changes.  Then son Peter falls on bad luck and Liz's life is sent once again into a tailspin.  She fares  remarkably well through the tragedy and manages to keep her head.  Her  children find it hard to accept a new man in their mother's life but Liz  makes peace and they all manage to make it through.  This book was better  than &quot;The Wedding.&quot;	2000-07-31

I tired very quickly of all the &quot;scrapping&quot; going on with her and her family and the problems at the Cafe.  This plot was boring and not enough  to keep me interested.  I may pick up another MMM book in years to come,  and hopefully will find it much more entertaining!	2000-07-27

Jackie never fails to keep me amused with her plots.  I will say that Rosarita is a twit and her husband needs to 'bone-up' on his people skills.  I felt bad for Madison, however,  with JC plots, these men are always abundant.  I wished she had thrown in a  bit of Lucky for us in this novel, but all-in-all it was a good read!

Ok, so the top reviewer was right:  Single women should NOT go meet a total stranger.  But, HELLO, this is FICTION here!   I just  adored Geraldine and Ben.  Jemima did the right thing about never  forgetting Ben and I myself am a firm believer in &quot;good things come to  those who wait! &quot;  And, if JJ lost all that weight and felt better  about herself than that's a good thing.  We're not saying she had no  friends because she was fat.  She had low self-esteem.	2000-07-24

Liz and  Jack have the perfect business, perfect marriage and great kids until a  Christmas tragedy changes everything.  Liz copes by throwing herself into  her work and kids.  Until a second tragedy hits.  Liz is almost at the end  of her rope until Dr. Bill Webster helps her cope.

I especially felt sorry for Gary because of his selfish, good for nothing father Wade.  The poor kid tries to make a living and his  drunk father tries to spend it on himself.  His mother is crazy and his  little sister doesn't talk.  The best thing to happen to him was to meet  Joe.  Joe wasn't exactly role-model material but he was a far better person  than Gary's father.  I can hardly wait to read FAY to see what happens to  her.  Getting away from this situation was the best thing she ever did.   Read this book: You won't be disappointed.	2000-05-25

Watching her sister and her boss go  through pregnancies has taken its toll and Ellen needs to make a decision  on her own since her man Malcolm can't commit.

Anna knew what her disease could mean to her and Joe and tried to keep from getting too close to him emotionally.  Joe, however  decide that Anna is what he wants and he will not go down without a fight.   Anna's mother Nora has a nasty mouth on her, but I liked the strong way  that she helps Anna.

Susanna analyzes herself a bit too much in the book.  I guess seeing the movie first was a mistake!   I expected the book to be the  same.  Some of the parts were similar but others made no sense.  I  especially was messed up because the movie was filmed where I live in Pa.   It was hard to imagine our State Hospital as her hospital in Mass.  All in  all, it was a good book.  Just read this BEFORE watching the movie!	2000-04-24

The other thing I found to be terrible was  the episode about the umbilical cord.  There are some things that are  better left unsaid.  The rest of the book was really good.

After the first half of the book, Jada and Michelle meet Angela and their lives really take on a new twist!   I think Angela was the  saving point of this story.  Jada and Michelle are suddenly single women  with children and Angela has a problem of her own to deal with.  I think  Jada's decision regarding her children was a good move, however her drastic  measures to get them from Clinton was a bit much.  I would not recommend  doing what she did to the house.  As far as Michelle goes, she did some  foolish things herself to protect her kids. This book is a riot, so hang in  there through the first few chapters, and you'll find yourself in the  middle of a great read! <br />To the reader from Australia-  Here are some  great books to try ! <br />Handyman by Linda Nichols<br />Plainsong by Ken  Haruf<br />Bittersweet Rain by Sandra Brown<br />And, of course, anything from  Nora Roberts and Danielle Steel!	2000-02-28

Anyone who has lost someone to cancer knows that it's a long, painful battle.  Ruth tried to make her last days as painless and fun as possible.

I give Nora credit for making up original  names for her male characters.  These Calhoun sisters will win your  heart!!!  C.C., with her black hair, is an auto mechanic, Amanda, with her  honey brown hair, is a hotel manager, Lilah, with her flame red mane is a  naturalist, and Suzanna is the blonde with the children.	1999-10-04

Shane is  absolutely smitten with her and they end up falling hard.  This was the  best followed by Devin, Jared, then Rafe.  Nora has an exceptional talent  for writing books in a series.

I read it because I love the MacGregor series and felt that I shouldn't miss any.  To the reviewer from  So.

I too was infatuated with a guy who was 10 years  older.  Nothing became of it, of course, but it was a good learning  experience.

The only reason I give &quot;Hannibal&quot; a four instead of a five is because I did not like the part about Hannibal in Italy.

I'll admit it's hard to follow most of it but if you don't like deep reading, it's great.  Jane a.k.a. Janie has a bit of growing to do and the characters in the book are  doing their best to help her. I think I like Archie the best of all the  characters.  This book is somewhat along the lines of &quot;Local  Girls.&quot;	1999-08-03

Gretel and her friend Jill are typical teenagers with not-so-typical families.  This book was short and sweet, and I read it in 3  hours.  I will surely read more of Ms. Hoffman's books in the near future.   She has a great way with words and makes you feel like you know the  characters.	1999-07-26

I did enjoy the food descriptions throughout the book, even though other readers could not stand  them.  I wish the ending had been a little more complex and workable. I  enjoyed the characters of Miranda and Li, however, I could not stand Sheng.   Miranda's children should have been in the picture a lot more than they  were.	1999-06-29

This book was very good!!  Amy and her friend Stacy are the epitome of me in high school; smoking outside the school and hanging out in cars.  I especially loved Fat  Bev.  She was the icing on the cake and made Isabelle look like a  green-eyed monster! Isabelle acted much too old for her age. I wish the  book had been longer, but it was good nonetheless.  I can hardly wait for  another book by this author.	1999-06-28

I have to say the first story was very boring, but I gave it 4 stars because of &quot;One Man's Art.&quot; Grant and Gennie were great!!!  I agree with the first review: Grant's eyes were brown in one story and deep green in the next.  Bear in  mind that those two stories were written years ago, and were done  separately.  I have not read the first book &quot;Serena and Caine&quot; as  of yet.  I expect it will be very good.	1999-03-10

Natasha was stubborn and snippy with Spence, but after  taking his class, she decides there's more to him than she first thought.   This one is my favorite of the two. In &quot;Falling For Rachel&quot;,  Rachel is the public defender for Nick LeBeck, an out-of-control teen with  an older brother named Zack Muldoon.

She meets Sister Husband,  who invites her and her baby Americus, to live with her.  Novalee gains  many friends throughout this book, one being Forney Hull. This is a great  book, and is hard to put down until it's finished.  Oprah deserves an  &quot;A&quot; for this one!!!!	1999-01-25

I didn't think it was too great.  Sure, it was easy reading, but it was not very interesting.  It took me longer to read than most books. Ava was a  character who you almost felt sorry for, but something held you back.  I  did however like the character of Eddie.  He was described to a  &quot;T&quot; and was in my opinion the best character in the book.	1999-01-25

Jo Ann Beard tells a tale of her life in short stories which are perfect to read in bed.  I loved the stories of her childhood the best,  especially with her sister Linda.  Their mother is a sharp-tongued, beer  drinking woman, their father a barroom lush.  Her and Linda get into more  than their share of trouble. This was a great book!!!	1999-01-20

Andrew's ghost written material	&quot;Olivia&quot; was an OK sequel to the &quot;Logan&quot; series. I did, however find myself rather bored and could hardly wait to finish it and read something else. This &quot;ghost-written&quot; material is the  pits. Belinda is an airheaded brat who always has to have her way and finds  out in the end where all that playing gets you. Olivia is purely  cold-hearted and loves playing a real-life general to all in her path.   Read this ONLY if you read the rest and need to finish the series.	1999-01-20

After reading the first 4 books in this series, I really didn't think this one would be any better.  Boy, was I ever wrong!!!!! RUNAWAYS was really great!!! The 4 girls set off on their own, after a few bad experiences with  their foster father. I read this in 2 days and had I had more time, I would  have been done in a day!!! If the 1st four books disappointed you, this one  will change your mind!!!! I can hardly wait for the new book  &quot;Olivia&quot; to come out!	1999-01-06

Alexi is tall, dark and handsome and a member of the Police force.  Along comes Bess McKnee, little rich girl working on a new plot for  her soap opera.  She decides to use Alexi as her next mission.  Alexi does  not find Bess amusing at first, but soon warms up to her a lot. I can  hardly wait to read the &quot;Stanislaski Sisters.&quot;	1999-01-04
