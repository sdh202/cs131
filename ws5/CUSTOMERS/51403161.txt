This short novel begins with a 1764 setting in the forests of central Ohio (near present-day Coshocton, Ohio) at the junction of the Muskingum, the Tuscarawas, and the Waldhoning Rivers. The book presents a somewhat  romanticized picture of the American Indian at that time. The central  character is John Cameron Butler, known as True Son in the Delaware tribe  with which he has lived since he was four years old. He is now fifteen and  his life is being uprooted once again. The Indians have signed a treaty in  which they have to return all white captives to their original families,  even those who don't wish to go. All John knows is his life as an Indian  and now he has to return to the family (in Paxton, Pennsylvania, on the  Susquehanna River) he hasn't seen for eleven years. But, he doesn't fit in  there and he finds himself caught between two cultures. Although very well  written, it appears that Richter is suggesting that Indian/colonists  interactions were doomed from the very beginning. One culture had to win  and one had to lose. He presents the case where neither culture appeared  willing to tolerate nor to understand the other. And, in more general  terms, in my opinion Richter seems to hint that all such cultural conflicts  are fated to fail. This is a rather sad commentary on man. I certainly hope  it is not true and that there are good chances for Serb/Albanian,  Irish/English, Indian/Pakistani, etc., interactions. This book is often  used in reading assignments for students ranging from ages eleven through  fourteen. I find it also a depressing thought that such a dark vision of  man's capacity for tolerance and understanding is being presented to young,  impressionable minds. I would have hoped that teachers in the 1990s would  have found literary sources with a less negative outlook. It would appear  that some of the negative reviews provided by earlier, and much younger,  readers have some validity.	1999-07-13

This book, which was a 1944 Newbery Honor Book (that is, a runner-up to the Medal winner), continues the autobiography of Mrs. Wilders (1867-1957) through the years 1883 to 1885 when the author was 15 to 18 years old. It  begins immediately after the events described in &quot;Little Town on the  Prairie&quot;; she immediately begins her career as a school teacher in a  very small schoolhouse about twelve miles to the south of De Smet, South  Dakota (although South Dakota doesn't become a state until 1889). Through  experimentation, practice, and management, she becomes a good school  teacher and is able to keep up with her own studies. And, at the same time,  earn enough money to help keep her sister Mary in a college for the blind  in Iowa. Almanzo Wilder (1857-1949) continues to court her and drives her  home each weekend in a horse-drawn sleigh. As time goes by their friendship  turns to love and they are married and Laura goes off to Almanzo's  homestead to have her own little house on the prairie. Throughout the book,  the author continues to include details of frontier/homesteader life that  brings that part of our history to life and shows how people worked hard to  overcome difficulties, never giving up. In my opinion, this is the best  written of all of the books in the series. It also shows the love that  Laura and Almanzo truly had for each other.	1999-07-01

This novel by Tarkington won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. Actually, this is the second novel in a trilogy (the other two being &quot;The Turmoil&quot; (1915) and &quot;The Midlander&quot; (1923)). The novel  chronicles three generations of a leading family in Indiana, including  their period of decline. Major Amberson, who had earlier acquired a  fortune, is the dominating head of a socially prominent family in the  midwest U.S. His daughter Isabel is in love with Eugene Morgan but, through  a misunderstanding, they break off their relationship. Isabel marries a man  with whom she has little feelings and gives birth to a son, George, who  grows up conceited and arrogant. Eugene, now a widower, returns to the  midwest with his daughter Lucy and starts up an automobile factory. Lucy  falls in love with George and Isabel and Eugene begin seeing each other  again. But, George is appalled that his mother is considering marrying  someone outside of their class. He takes her overseas to prevent the  marriage but later brings her back when she is dying. The Amberson's  fortune is now depleted, George is forced to start working for a living at  a chemical plant, and his old friends appear to applaud his \\"comeuppance.\\"  But, after an automobile accident, George, Eugene, and Lucy, who still is  in love with George, are reconciled. The story of the Ambersons represent  the changes that U.S. society has undergone, particularly near the turn of  the century: those in upper society who earned their places by heredity are  slowly being replaced by those who earned their position by their  achievements in industry, business, and in finance (that is, by their own  labors). George had been unwilling to change. Perhaps it is appropriate  that it is an automobile that forces him to realize this. In July of 1998,  the editorial board of the Modern Library listed this book as one of the  top 100 novels written in the English language for the twentieth century. I  do feel that a response is needed to Mr. Ted Ficklen of St. Louis (of Aug.  12, 1998) who gave the book a poor review. I certainly was not an English  major yet I read &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; long before the  Modern Library list had come out. And, I knew of Booth Tarkington; the  Penrod books were on my shelves when I was a kid. You may not know of  Tarkington but others obviously have; there aren't too many authors who  have won two Pulitzer Prizes in Fiction.	1999-07-01

In this book, a writer named Willing, an old friend of George Apley, is requested by Apley's son John to collect all of the late Apley's correspondence and  use them to form a biography. Although Willing is using them to eulogize  Apley and to describe the life of upper-class Bostonians, the reader feels  pity at the waste of a life and how a man's class and upbringing can quelch  his own desires and thoughts. The book is an excellent example of the use  of understatement. However, I am shocked to discover that this fairly well  known Pulitzer Prize winner is out-of-print. Surely this is the publisher's  fault.	1999-06-30

This intriguing novel won the 1987 Nebula Award for best science fiction novel of the year. This is actually more of a psychological fantasy rather than a work of classical science fiction, although there are clearly  science fiction elements present. A female archaeologist working on a dig  in Central America is able to identify with the spirit of an ancient Mayan  woman. The attempted sacrifice of this woman is apparently linked to the  destruction of the Mayan civilization. The archaeologist's ability to link  herself with the early inhabitants of an archaeological site has given her  great advantages in her field. The interactions between the Mayan, the  archeologist, and the archeologist's estranged daughter result in a healing  embrace across time. All serious students of science fiction and  speculative literature should read this book.	1999-06-28

This science fiction novel deals with the start of the military and mercenary career of Miles Vorkosigan, son of Cordelia and Aral Vorkosigan of the planet Barrayar. The assassination attempt made at the end of the  novel &quot;Barrayar&quot; (1991) has given Miles a stunted growth and very  brittle bones. He is now seventeen years old and tries to qualify for  Barrayar's military school but fails. Then, during a vacation on another  planet, he finds himself involved in an interplanetary war in which he  improvises a mercenary force. Later, upon returning to Barrayar, he finds  himself the focus of a plot to destroy the political power of his father.  The book, as are most of the books in the Vorkosigan series, are very  quickly read and most fans of space operas or of science/military fiction  really enjoy them.	1999-06-28

This novel, which is a part of Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan space opera series, nevertheless does not utilize Miles as a central character. Ethan Urquhart is a physician on the planet Athos, a planet which has no women  and only gay men (in fact, women are forbidden to even land on the planet)!  A rather unusual story. The planet has purchased certain ova so that new  cell cultures can be made (the men on Athos are grown via a cell culture  process). A problem in genetics has arisen and fresh ova are needed.  However, the viable ova are not delivered and Ethan has to travel off  planet to solve the mystery. In so doing, he becomes enmeshed in  interplanetary politics and has to interact with one of the  &quot;dreaded&quot; females (Elli Quinn, Miles top assistant). But, given  the unusual premise, it is still not clear to me why the men of Athos  regard women as repellent and evil. That certainly is not the impression  that one gets today. Is Ms. Bujold suggesting that the gay community is  intolerant? I don't think she is; nevertheless, that is the sense one gets.	1999-06-28

The corporation considers them property rather than workers  since it was the corporation that actually made them. A visiting welding  instructor and engineer named Leo Graf sets out to free them.

This novel won the 1974 Nebula Award and the 1975 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year as well as the 1975 Jupiter Award. It is centered about a complex society that is founded upon anarchism: an ordered society without laws. The &quot;dispossessed&quot; in the novel are the  millions of the inhabitants of Anarres, an arid moon of the lush planet of  Urras. Two centuries earlier, the followers of an anarchist philosopher had  fled Urras to forge a new society, a society that has done away with the  concept of &quot;possession.&quot; There is no property on Anarres, no  money, no marriage (I hope that Le Guin is not meaning to suggest that  marriage is a possession by one or other of the participants), no  government, no laws, no prisons. Even the language reflects this attitude.  Possessive pronouns are even avoided. Instead of saying &quot;My hand  hurts,&quot; one would say &quot;The hand hurts me.&quot; A mathematical  genius of Anarres, who has made a conceptual breakthrough that allows for  the development of the ansible (an instantaneous communication device that  other science fiction authors will begin to use), travels to Urras. He had  been having difficulties with the philosophical ideas of his home world but  the social structure of Urras baffles him. The cultures of both world cause  problems for the protagonist Shevik. This is one of the best science  fiction novels of all time. However, I'm surprised at some of the comments  by earlier reviewers. It appears that some reviewers are really offended at  more cerebral type of novels. I gave this book five stars. And, I also gave  &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; five stars. Both books have their place  within the genre. Perhaps we should be not so narrow in our tastes so that  we exclude valuable works. Both of these novels should be read by any  serious student of science fiction literature.	1999-06-27

Over several years, I have read all of the Hugo and Nebula Award winners, and seeing that &quot;Slow River&quot; was a recipient, I  naturally had to read it as well. However, upon reading the jacket  information, I became angry once again with the members of the Science  Fiction Writers of America who vote on the Nebula Awards. It seemed that,  once again, the SFWA members are being swayed by one or more of several  groups who have their own agenda and who are not concentrating on what  really is science fiction (or even, in some cases, speculative fiction).  The Nebula Award is losing the prestige that it once had by awarding the  prize to novels that represent subgenres. Reading the jacket information  leads one to the conclusion that this particular book falls in that  subgenre of lesbian science fiction (which has a significant following).  But, I read it anyway. And, I'm glad that I did. It was pretty good after  all and did contain some good science, particularly of waste and toxic  controls. There aren't too many science fiction novels that rely on  hydrodynamics. I personally may not have voted for it as the best novel of  the year, but it is up near the top. A young woman, who is a member of a  rich family who control the market of bioengineered organisms needed for  the repurification system of water, has been kidnapped. She escapes,  discovers that her family were not going to pay the ransome, and hides  herself in an English city in the mid-21st century. She has to regain  control of her life, find out who was behind her kidnapping, why her sister  had committed suicide, and discover who is trying to sabotage the water  purification plant where she has obtained a job.	1999-06-27

It is not completely clear to me if Ms. Le Guin  planned this book, the sequel to &quot;The Farthest Shore,&quot; primarily for a teenage readership, for adults who lovingly recalled the other novels in the series (some of which won awards for children's literature), or both. My local  public library has ten copies, all of which are found in the children's  section.  Apparently, Le Guin had received some criticism years ago from  some quarters in the women's movement with respect to the previous volumes  in the series. It was felt by some that the women in Le Guin's stories had  little impact or power. The men were the ones who directed the action  (although that isn't quite true in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;). Well,  with this fourth volume in the series, she has addressed that issue. This  is a celebration of the inherent power of women. In this last book in the  tetralogy, the wizard Sparrowhawk (or Ged) returns to the island of Gont  having lost his powers. This volume is centered about Tenar, who was the  young girl in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan.&quot; She is now a middle-aged  widow whose two children have grown up. She has to help Sparrowhawk find  peace as well as help an abused child. Surprisingly, this novel was awarded  the 1990 Nebula Award for best science fiction novel of the year although  it is clearly not science fiction. It is an excellent novel in speculative  fiction and in fantasy. But, it is not the best science fiction novel of  the year! The voters in the Science Fiction Writers of America seem to lose  their focus every now and then. I wholeheartedly recommend  &quot;Tehanu.&quot; But, the Nebula Award is going to lose its prestige if  the voters aren't careful.	1999-06-27

It was originally  written for juveniles and teenagers; yet, it achieved a much wider  following. It won the 1969 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; Horn Book Award for  Excellence. The story is centered about the young boy known as Sparrowhawk,  later known as Ged, who goes off to be trained as a wizard. His pride and  anger accidentally lets loose a shadow upon the world. Ged learns humility  and duty and, after confronting a dragon threatening villagers, he goes off  to restore the balance in the world by facing this shadow. The reader  becomes well aware of the importance of words: words, by themselves, can  become acts. We have to be very careful in what we say and how we phrase  sentences.

This book won the 1969 Nebula Award and the 1970 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year. I recall first reading this book when it first appeared and being stunned at the originality and the beauty. I have  read every Hugo and Nebula winner (and most of the nominees) and this is  still near the top. In this classic novel, all of the action takes place on  the planet known as Gethen or Winter, a frozen world set in Le Guin's  Hainish universe. All of the humanoid inhabitants of Winter are exactly the  same as the humans of Earth except in the means of reproduction. They are  all of a single sex and can assume either sex when in &quot;heat.&quot; If  one person of a couple becomes female, the other automatically becomes  male. The culture and society of this world is shaped not only by the harsh  environment but by this sexual structure. A main portion of the novel is  concerned with the trek of a human ambassador and ethnologist, Genly Ai,  across Winter's surface with a Getthenian. The man from Earth and the  manwoman from Winter grow to know and understand each other. The novel not  only raises issues about our perceptions of sex but the problems associated  with cultural chauvinism. It is a book that all serious students of science  fiction literature should read. For those earlier reviewers who awarded  this book a low rating because it wasn't &quot;classic&quot; science  fiction, you have to recall that psychology, sociology, and anthropology  are all sciences (remember that the author's father, T. Kroeber, was the  first Chairman of the Anthropology Department at U.C. Berkeley), just like  physics, chemistry, or, in my case, biochemistry. And to the reviewer from  Washington, D.C., (of March 3, 1999) who complained that Genly Ai was too  uninteresting as the main character. Perhaps that was the point.

It was a 1972 Newbery Honor  Book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best contribution to  American children's literature.

This book is the winner of the 1992 Nebula Award for best science fiction novel of the year and cowinner of the 1993 Hugo Award. The History Department of a University (in or near Oxford) in the mid-21st century (I believe the year is 2048) sends its historians back in time to study  peoples and events. A young historian is supposed to be sent back to 1320  England to study the customs of the Middle Ages. However, she is  accidentally sent to 1348 just in time for the Black Death to arrive in  England. The book depicts the effects of the plague magnificently and shows  people at both their worse and their best. I really enjoyed reading it. As  you can tell from a number of the earlier reviewers, there are readers who  didn't care for the book too much. Some commented on the rather dark  ending. Of course, that was the point. Whole towns were wiped out by the  plague. There was no escape. Others suggested that there was very little  science, even though time travel is crucial to the story. However, if one  reads any time-travel novel or short story in which the characters travel  to the past, one will typically see the same level of science as is  presented in &quot;Doomsday Book.&quot; In addition, don't forget that  epidemiology is also a science. There are even critics who suggest that the  book has little relevance for modern readers. I find that hard to believe  when the world is now experiencing a new epidemic, albeit not as fast  moving as the Black Plague. Let us all hope that we don't have the  experiences of our ancestors.	1999-06-27

In 1988, Asimov published a prequel to his famous Foundation series. He also uses this book to continue to tie in other novels that he had already written, most notably all of the robot stories, particularly involving R.  Daneel Olivaw and Lije Baley, as well as &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;  (1950) (in fact, in such a larger scheme, &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot;  follows &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; and precedes &quot;Forward the  Foundation&quot; (1993)). In this novel, he finally uses Hari Seldon as a  main character. A young assistant professor of mathematics, Hari Seldon,  travels to the planet Trantor (the governing planet of the galactic empire)  to present a paper at a convention on a new field he has begun referred to  as psychohistory. In his paper, Seldon suggests that it might be  theoretically possible to develop mathematical equations and techniques of  analyses to predict, with strong statistical analysis, future events of  human history on a broad scale (in which the discipline only is applicable  to extremely large numbers of people). Asimov provides some hints that this  field might use chaos theory as well, although he never uses that term.  Seldon also believes that, while theoretically possible, it isn't  practical. There are those, however, who believe that the galactic empire  is collapsing and hope to use a developed psychohistory theory to help  direct human society. Seldon finds himself running from the Emperor's  agents and hiding in various different enclaves throughout the planet  Trantor, and thus learning more and more about Trantor (those reviewers who  criticize this trek are obviously missing its importance in the greater  scheme of the series). He is attempting to find a smaller model of galactic  populations that would allow him the ability to develop his theory. There  are legends that tens of thousands of years ago, man had lived on only one  planet: Earth. He is hoping to find some historical evidence for Earth and,  in sodoing, he discovers some surprising facts and events. I am probably  unusual in that I enjoyed this book the most in the series. Perhaps its  because I also live in an academic environment and see many similarities to  Hari's problems. Asimov was obviously drawing on his own experiences.	1999-06-26

This book, a part of Asimov's noted Foundation series, concerns events taking place between &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; (1988) and &quot;Foundation&quot;  (1951) and helps pull together those two books. It consists of a series of  four stories, each taking place at a different time in the life of the  mathematician Hari Seldon. The first story (\\"Eto Demerzel\\") begins about  eight years after the end of &quot;Prelude to Foundation.&quot; Seldon's  work on his mathematical theory of psychohistory is going slowly. He finds  that he has to assist the First Minister of the Empire, Eto Demerzel, in  defeating a populist demagogue. (A new Foundation trilogy was begun in  1997. &quot;Foundation's Fear&quot; by Gregory Benford takes place between  the first and second stories in &quot;Forward the Foundation.&quot; Greg  Bear's &quot;Foundation and Chaos&quot; and David Brin's &quot;Foundation's  Triumph&quot; also take place within the time frame of &quot;Forward the  Foundation&quot;) The second story, \\"Cleon I\\", takes place ten years later.  Seldon is now First Minister of the Empire and he finds that he and his  adopted son, Raych, must defeat the remnants of an opposition group and  stop an assassination attempt. In the third story, \\"Dors Venabili\\",  occurring about ten years later, Seldon and his wife, the historian Dors  Venabili, must quelch the designs of a ruthless military junta that is  governing the Empire as well as detect and stop someone within the  psychohistory project from taking it over. In the last story (\\"Wanda  Seldon\\"), about six years later, Seldon and his granddaughter Wanda must  find a way to obtain funding to continue the research after Hari Seldon  dies. He soon comes up with the idea of two, independent Foundations whose  goal it is to return the Galaxy to his former glory after the upcoming  millennia of dark ages. In addition to these four stories, there is a short  Epilogue that takes place two years after the end of Part I of  &quot;Foundation&quot; (1951). This series has had an enormous impact in  the history of science fiction and all serious students of science fiction  literature should be familiar with all of the books in the series.	1999-06-26

This is the classic tale of a boy's life in St. Petersburg, Missouri (based on Mark Twain's [Samuel L.

The original manuscript of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; was  the first American novel to be submitted to a publisher in typewritten  form. Tom is living in the house of his Aunt Polly with the irritating Sid,  who turns him in for playing hooky from school. Tom's punishment is to  whitewash a thirty-yard fence, nine feet high. With legendary skill and  deviousness, he is able to get his friends to complete the onerous task!  Later, he and his good friend Huck Finn go to a graveyard to swing a dead  cat (to get rid of warts). They witness Injun Joe murder the town doctor  and see Joe set up the evidence to appear that the drunken Muff Potter is  the assailant. The boys hide out on Jackson's Island and the town believe  them drowned. Of course, at their funeral they appear, falling right into  the middle of the ceremony. At the trial of Muff Potter, Tom proves Potter  innocent; but, Injun Joe escapes. At a town picnic, the boys (as well as  Tom's girl Becky Thatcher) get lost in a cave, find Joe's treasure, are  rescued, and become heroes. And, unfortunately, respectable. Tom and Huck  represent typical boys, having their own adventures and dreams. It is sad  to think that, in today's world of behavioral psychologists, counselors,  and some teachers, both Tom and Huck would be considered abnormal and some  physicians might even prescribe certain drugs to &quot;calm them  down.&quot; And, they are just being boys. The adventurous spirit of Tom  and Huck should be celebrated, not repressed! Not enough adults read  &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; or &quot;Huckleberry Finn.&quot;	1999-06-26

Gregory Benford, Greg Bear, and David Brin had been commissioned to write a new trilogy based on Isaac Asimov's noted Foundation series. &quot;Foundation's Fear&quot; is the first of these. The events in this  novel take place between the events described in the first two stories of  Asimov's &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot; (Greg Bear's &quot;Foundation  and Chaos&quot; and David Brin's &quot;Foundation's Triumph&quot; also use  Hari Seldon as a main character). Here the mathematician and developer of  psychohistory, Hari Seldon, has to deal with all the political infighting,  intrigue, and fear of assassination in order to be the new First Minister  of the dying Galactic Empire. In fact, to avoid assassination, Seldon and  his wife escape temporarily to a planet where they participate in a project  which enables observers to participate in the experiences of primates on  the planet by melding with their consciousness (this turns out to help  provide Seldon with insights for his psychohistory). All this while trying  to identify equations and factors that are missing from his theory of  psychohistory. In addition, two computer simulations of two ancient  figures, Voltaire (Franois Marie Arouet) and Joan of Arc have been found  and are set up to present a debate between the forces of faith and of  science. In addition, alien entities are found to be hidden in the  electronic circuitry of the planet-sized computer system, and they threaten  to bring down the empire. Seldon has to deal with all of these. There  appear to be two main types of reviews by readers: those that hate the book  because it appears to fail to follow the style and entertainment of the  original Asimov series and those that judge the book on its own,  disassociated somewhat from the original series. I personally fall in the  midpoint: I found sections reather tedious while I found other discussions  fascinating. This is a different type of book than what one may expect (as  Benford mentions inhis afterword; in fact, it might be useful to read the  afterword first). And, it does add to the series. It allows future authors  considerable flexibility in adding to the Foundation stories. As for those  of you who are upset with the addition of &quot;wormholes&quot; to the  novel, remember that Benford is a physics professor. He had to include  them!	1999-06-26

In this third volume of the first Foundation series (originally consisting of two stories published in a magazine in 1948 and 1949), survivers of the First Foundation, as well as the Mule, hunt for the Second Foundation.  Asimov later published a sequel, &quot;Foundation's Edge&quot; in 1982.  I've now read this series twice (I first read them in the early 1960s).  But, my father has read them ten times. It just shows how popular the  series has been. In Part I, titled &quot;Search by the Mule,&quot; five  years have passed after the end of the events described in &quot;Foundation  and Empire.&quot; The Mule (now, in effect, ruler of the Galactic Empire)  goes in search of the Second Foundation which he regards as a serious  threat to his rule. The Second Foundation, which is quite vulnerable, has  to find some way to dissuade him and return the galaxy to the path outline  by psychohistory. In Part II, titled &quot;Search by The Foundation,&quot;  the history begins about 95 years after the end of Part I. A small group of  individuals in the First Foundation, including an electroneurophysiologist,  come to the conclusion that the Second Foundation's ability to control  people's minds is repellant.

This is the first published volume (which was originally published as four short stories in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine, 1942-1944, with an introductory section written in 1949) of Asimov's famous  trilogy, which affected many later works. This trilogy, which won a special  Hugo Award in 1966 for the best science fiction series of all time, was  later expanded into further volumes by Asimov (in fact, two prequels are  Asimov's &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and &quot;Forward the  Foundation&quot;; after Asimov's death in 1992, other authors [for example,  Gregory Benford's &quot;Foundation's Fear,&quot; Greg Bear's  &quot;Foundation and Chaos,&quot; and David Brin's &quot;Foundation's  Triumph&quot;] have contributed to the series [note that there are now five  novels that serve as prequels to Asimov's first published Foundation  book!]) . In these stories, spacecraft travel over large distances via  &quot;jumps.&quot; The ships spend most of their time in a form of  hyperspace, each jump being aimed at a certain target star. The central  character, Hari Seldon, is a psychohistorian. Psychohistory is the  mathematics dealing with the reactions of very large masses of mankind to  social and economic stimuli (and the recent advances in chaos theory in  advanced mathematics lends credibility to Asimov's psychohistory). His  calculations predicts an end to the Galactic Empire (an empire remarkably  similar to the Roman Empire on Earth). Two Foundations are set up to ease  mankind through the dark area predicted (or else, the dark period will last  30000 years) and, after a thousand years, will join together to form a  second Empire. Although Asimov's early writing style leaves much to be  desired (recall this was all put together in his early 20s during World War  II when he worked for the U. S. Navy and when he was finishing his graduate  work at Columbia Univ.), it is still fun reading; I enjoy every time I  reread it. It is particularly enjoyable in the context of the other  volumes. This first published volume has five parts. In &quot;The  Psychohistorians,&quot; an introductory tale (which begins about 46 years  after the events described in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and  thirteen years after the events described in the last story of  &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;), Dr. Hari Seldon and a young colleague  are arrested on the planet Trantor (the governing center of the Galactic  Empire) and tried for treason. Seldon's group are to be exiled to the  planet Terminus on the galactic rim where they will form a scientific  refuge. Seldon also plans to set up another group somewhere else. We later  learn, in Part III, that this other group (the Second Foundation) is  located at a place known as Star's End at the other end of the galaxy. In  &quot;The Encyclopedists,&quot; taking place about fifty years later, a  large number of members of the original Foundation are on the planet  Terminus and are compiling a massive encyclopedia to prepare for the  upcoming dark age. But, why were no psychobiologists and only one  psychologist present among the original colonists? The remaining three  parts continue the development of the Foundation on Terminus.	1999-06-25

They are forced to come into contact with beings  (Earthlings) who they regard as obscene due to the presence of this  emotion. &quot;Sucker Bait&quot; (1954) is centered on a world having two  suns (the two suns and the planet form a Trojan orbital system of an  equilateral triangle). A previous colony of a thousand members had died a  hundred years earlier and a new expedition has been sent to discover why.  Asimov also suggests in this story that scientists in the future may become  so specialized that they will be unaware of basic facts anywhere outside of  their specific field. I really doubt that. Anyone who has a love of science  has a joy of all science. That will be true in the future as well (However,  there will always be people [in any field] who are narrow minded.).	1999-06-25

This classic novel was written by an author who wrote it at her home a few miles south of Gainesville (in Cross Creek, Florida) and it won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. It is about life in rural central Florida in the  second half of the 19th century, being centered around a boy (Jody Baxter),  his family, and his pet fawn (Flag). Throughout the novel, the reader sees  a boy growing up and having to face some tough decisions. We also learn  much about the natural history, environment, folk remedies and beliefs, and  culture of rural Florida. We also learn how precarious one's existence is  out in the wild. Jody's father, Penny Baxter, has to kill a doe in order to  use a folk remedy for a snake bite, not knowing that there is a little fawn  nearby. Jody keeps the fawn to raise and to have as a friend. But, as the  fawn grows older, problems arise. The author based her main characters  loosely (very loosely) on a rural family she knew living in central  Florida. Contrary to most reports, this family did not live in Cross Creek.  They had a small place deep in the woods in the center of what is now the  Ocala National Forest. I decided to see if I could find that site in the  late 1980s. It turned out not be difficult at all. Armed with a map of the  National Forest, I went on a hike (on some beautiful trails) and found the  place. Nothing remains of the house. However, the family burial plot is  still there, as are the graves of most of the members of the family.  Unfortunately, it is sad to report that a number of the headstones have  been stolen. Some of the stones referred to Civil War veterans. As you  probably know, such stones draw very good prices on the \\"black market.\\" The  Forest Service had signs posted to warn people against stealing items but,  being deep in the woods, they were taken anyway. I'm certain that the  people who took the stones have no idea of their literary significance.  Perhaps one day the Forest Service or some historical organization will  replace the stones, but with all the cutbacks in funding, it'll probably be  a long time before that happens.	1999-06-25

This epic from the Assyro-Babylonian culture (parts of which were probably written as early as 3000 B.C.) contains perhaps the earliest known example of man's quest for immortality (the version I read was the translation by N.

Apparently, a historical Gilgamesh actually existed and ruled Uruk  in Mesopotamia in the first half of the third millennium B. C. (probably in  the first dynasty of Uruk). In the epic, the god Anu attempts to curb the  harsh rule of Gilgamesh, the son of the goddess Ninsun and a mortal priest  of Uruk, by the creation of a strong and wild man named Enkidu (or, Eabani)  (many scholars regard Enkidu as a symbol of primitive man). After a fight  between the two, they become friends and have a number of adventures. In  one tale, Gilgamesh is wooed by Irnina (or, Ishtar). But she is rejected by  Gilgamesh and the bull sent by her father Anu to destroy him is killed by  Gilgamesh and Enkidu (some regard this story as a nature myth in which  Gilgamesh represents the solar god of the spring season and the goddess is  the goddess of love and fertility). Later in the epic Enkidu is stricken  with disease and dies. Gilgamesh is devastated and wishes to avoid a  similar fate. He goes in search of eternal youth and immortality (perhaps  the earliest example of such a quest in literature). After more adventures,  which includes him learning the Babylonian story of the great flood, he  finds the answer to his quest; but, it is quickly lost. Even though this is  probably the earliest epic, it has considerable allegorical significance.  It is perhaps the earliest known description of man's quest for the meaning  of life and the struggle to avoid death. What is learned is that death is  inevitable and man should enjoy the life he has.	1999-06-24

Lewis also won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Literature. It is the story of Martin Arrowsmith, a medical researcher who, while attending a mid-western medical school, is influenced by an aged bacteriologist. Arrowsmith marries a nurse, who will encourage  his career in research, and tries his hand at private practice. However, he  fails in that endeavor. After a number of positions he joins a research  institute in New York where he discovers a new microorganism but is  &quot;scooped.&quot; He travels to the West Indies to try his  &quot;bacteriophage&quot; on an epidemic. After his wife and colleague die,  he starts administering the serum indiscriminately, destroying the results  of his experiment. He returns to New York and marries a rich widow.  However, social life interferes with his research and his search for truth.  He quits the Institute and establishes a lab in Vermont with Terry Wickett,  an uncouth but conscientious chemist. The model for Terry Wickett was Dr.  John Howard Northrup (1891-1987), who will later win the 1946 Nobel Prize  in Chemistry. Apparently, the model for Martin Arrowsmith was provided by  the microbiologist and writer Paul de Kruif, whose book &quot;Microbe  Hunters&quot; became very popular. The novel also contrasts the idealism of  the research scientist, who unfortunately looses touch with those that care  for him, and the apparent avarice of the medical profession.	1999-06-24

This is an excellent novel about a nurse serving in Vietnam during the war (the author was also a nurse in Vietnam). A Vietnam veteran myself, I recommend it highly. The main character, Lt. Kitty McCulley, is having a  difficult time with her nursing responsibilities and with her interactions  with others. An elderly Vietnamese holy man gives her an amulet which  allows her to see the &quot;auras&quot; of others. It helps her guide  herself through the war and helps her find herself in the end. I thoroughly  enjoyed the novel and Ms. Scarborough's writing (note the five stars I  awarded) and I recommend the book to everyone (the publisher should be shot  for letting it go out of print). However, I do have a bone to pick! What  makes this novel so different can be seen by the fact that it won the 1988  Nebula Award for best science fiction novel of the year, the Nebula Award  being given by the Science Fiction Writers of America. I loved the book;  but, it was not the best science fiction novel of 1988. It's excellent  speculative fiction and I'm certain that is the reason the members voted  for it; but, I'm sorry Ms. Scarborough, every few years the SFWA seem to go  off on a tangent. Nevertheless, because it has won the Nebula, it is now  incumbent that all serious students of science fiction literature read  &quot;The Healer's War.&quot; But then, they should read it anyway.	1999-06-22

The first book in the famous allegorical Chronicles of Narnia fantasy series for children. Four English school children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) visit an old Professor to avoid the air raids in London during  World War II. They discover an &quot;entrance&quot; to a world of fantasy  through a wardrobe. It is a world that will change them forever. They  assist the golden lion Aslan to defeat the White Witch who has cursed  Narnia with eternal winter: the classic conflict of good vs. evil. This is  the first in the Chronicles to be published. However, &quot;The Magician's  Nephew&quot; relates events that take place before the events in this book  and many, including the publisher, suggest that individuals read that book  first. I disagree. I think the series flows much better when read in the  order of their publication. As one reads the series, particularly with the  last volume, one become more attuned to the spiritual aspects of the tales.  And in responce to muchadoaboutlisa from Australia (of May 6, 1999), as we  can tell from the last volume, Narnia does exist.	1999-06-22

This children's book in the allegorical Chronicles of Narnia series takes place about three years Narnia-time (or, one year Earth-time) after the events described in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; (this book was the third to  be published and, in my opinion, should be the third read in the series).  Prince Caspian and his friends sail into the unknown East to find seven  missing noblemen. The expedition evolves in a journey of discovery (even,  personal discovery). The boy Eustace, a cousin to Lucy and Edmund, must  learn to see his own flaws and to painfully lose all of his  &quot;encrusted&quot; character imperfections and vices. In response to  Henry from Canberra, Australia (of April 3, 1999), I didn't think Lewis was  preaching; he does not overdo the &quot;Christianity thing&quot; (of  course, that was his point). And, to drown a hero like Reepicheep??? Can  you imagine what the responses would have been from young readers? In  addition, I seriously doubt that such a death would fit into Lewis'  allegory and the ultimate fate of Reepicheep.	1999-06-22

However, scientists note some problems with regards to the  dinosaur population on this island: for example, there are far too many  predators for such a small island, there are very few mature dinosaurs, and  the dinosaurs clearly are behaving abnormally. While this is a fun book to  read (particularly with respect to the discussion of why organisms become  extinct and the observation that, without the teaching influence of  parents, individuals would not know correct behavioral patterns needed for  a particular colony of that organism) there were unfortunately some obvious  scientific errors (e.g., with respect to prions).	1999-06-22

In other  publications, Lewis had stated that his children's fantasies were just  stories, without hidden meanings (I'll always wonder if he said that with  tongue in cheek). Yet, one can easily view the lion Aslan as creator,  counselor, and savior. This is much more apparent in some of the other  volumes in the series.

2844011:US	51403161	RY3H9P055R1R0	0140440224	935878950	The Canterbury Tales: In Modern English (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	170	188	N	N	One of the major influences of modern literature.	The version of this classic I read was a translation into modern English by Nevill Coghill. As you can see above, I awarded Chaucer (and the translation) five stars; but I do have a criticism. This translation (and  many other publications of Chaucer) do not contain the two prose tales  (&quot;The Tale of Melibee&quot; and &quot;The Parson's Tale&quot;). These  are rarely read and I understand the publisher's and the translator's  desire to keep the book to a managable size. Still, that should be the  readers decision and no one else's. I had to go to the University library  and get a complete copy in order to read those sections. As I mentioned,  this copy is a translation into modern English. However, I do recommend  that readers take a look at the Middle English version, at least of the  Prologue. Many years ago, when I was in high school, my teacher had the  entire class memorize the first part of the Prologue in the original Middle  English. Almost forty years later, I still know it. I am always stunned at  how beautiful, fluid, and melodic the poetry is, even if you don't  understand the words. Twenty-nine pilgrims meet in the Tabard Inn in  Southwark on their way to Canterbury. The host suggests that the pilgrims  tell four stories each in order to shorten the trip (the work is incomplete  in that only twenty-four stories are told). The tales are linked by  narrative exchanges and each tale is presented in the manner and style of  the character providing the story. This book was a major influence on  literature. In fact, the development of the &quot;short story&quot; format  owes much to these tales. All of the elements needed in a successful short  story are present: flow of diction and freedom from artifice, faultless  technical details and lightness of touch, and a graphic style which propels  the story. In poetry, Chaucer introduced into English what will become  known as rime royal (seven-line stanza riming ababbcc), the eight-line  stanza (riming ababbcbc), and the heroic couplet. His poetry is noted for  being melodious and fluid and has influenced a great many later poets. He  has a remarkable talent for imagery and description. With respect to humor,  which often receives the most negative responses from a certain group of  readers (as witnessed by some of the comments below), there are at least  three types: good humor which produces a laugh and is unexpected and  unpredictable (for example, the description of the Prioress in the  Prologue), satire (for example, the Wife of Bath's confession in the  Prologue to her tale), and course humor, which is always meant to keep with  the salty character of the teller of the tale or with the gross character  of the tale itself. I am really stunned at the comments of the reviewer  from London (of June 21, 1999). He/she clearly has no idea of the influence  of the work nor on the reasons why Chaucer chose to present the humor the  way he has. T. Keene of May 17 gave the work only three stars, presumably  because it was once banned in Lake City, Florida. (Does that mean it would  get fewer stars if it hadn't been banned?) Perhaps our London reviewer will  be more comfortable moving to Lake City! Another reviewer suggested that  &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; was only a classic because it had been  around a long time. No! Chaucer's own contemporaries (for example, Gower,  Lydgate, and Hoccleve) acknowledged his genius. My goodness, even science  fiction books acknowledge the Tales (for example, Dan Simmons'  &quot;Hyperion,&quot; which won the 1990 Hugo Award for best science  fiction novel of the year, is based on the Tales). These brief entries are  too short to review all of the tales. Let me just descibe the first two.  Other readers might consider reviewing the other tales in later responses.  In &quot;The Knight's Tale,&quot; the Theban cousins Palamon and Arcite,  while prisoners of the King of Athens (Theseus), fall in love with Emelyn,  sister of Hippolyta and sister-in-law to Theseus. Their rivalry for Emelyn  destroys their friendship. They compete for her in a tournament with  different Greek gods supporting the two combatants. Arcite, supported by  Mars, wins but soon dies from a fall from his horse (due to the  intervention of Venus and Saturn). Both Palamon and Emelyn mourn Arcite,  after which they are united. It is the basis of &quot;The Two Noble  Kinsmen&quot; by Fletcher and Shakespeare. &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot; is  a ribald tale about a husband, the carpenter John, who is deceived by the  scholar Nicholas and the carpenter's wife Alison that a second flood is  due. In this tale, a prospective lover is deceived into kissing a lady in  an unusual location. And, recalling the response from our reviewer from  London, apparently this Tale should not be read by people from London (or  Lake City)!	1999-06-22

In this short and moving novel, a young Anglican vicar named Mark Brian, who unknowingly has a medical condition that gives him only two or three more years left to live, is sent to serve in an Indian village (Kingcome  Village) on the coast of British Columbia. The village is made up of  members of the Tsawataineuk Tribe of the Kwakiutl. The vicar learns much of  the culture of the Kwakiutl, what is needed of him to serve these people,  how two different cultures interact, the problems associated with the loss  of the young to a newer world, of problems with alcohol, the loss of a  heritage, and even the loss of a history. In turn, the Kwakiutl teach the  vicar about life, about service, about love, and about quiet faith.

This is the first novel of Ms. Markandaya, an Indian author living in England (she has written at least nine other novels). This novel, written in the first person, presents the life of a peasant woman living in a  remote Hindu village in India. Since the village is never named nor is a  year ever mentioned in the book, a number of commenters have suggested that  the book represents the story of India herself, arising out of feudalism  and through industrialization. One of the characters is an English  physician, Kennington (called Kenny by the narrator), who often appears to  exhibit compassion for the people yet continues to fail to understand them  or their culture (nor does he ever appear to make a serious effort to  learn). This is a criticism many have given toward the British rule of  India. The book begins with the narrator, Rukmani, at an old age and near  death. She begins her story with her wedding. She was the third daughter of  a village head and, at the age of twelve, is married off to a tenant rice  farmer named Nathan. Through births, deaths, prosperous times, and  devastating times (such as times of famine and when they lose their farm  and are forced to travel to the city with nothing to call their own), she  and Nathan remain close and truly bonded together. Even at the time of her  own death approaching, she still sees him (her husband had passed away  earlier); he has never left her. The book also illustrates the importance  of family and the support one should always get from family. It is an  uplifting history of a poor, but intelligent, honest, and noble Indian  woman.	1999-06-21

Argos lost  the battle and both of the sons of Oedipus were killed. The new ruler of  Thebes, Creon (the brothers' uncle), refused the mothers the right to  recover their sons' bodies for burial. Theseus, at first, refuses to help  them since it was Adrastus's folly to get involved in that war; however,  Theseus is persuaded by his own mother.

This novel is centered on corporate politics in a high-tech computer firm in Seattle. A high level executive in the company has been passed over for promotion by a woman from another division in the firm. This woman, with  whom he had a relationship ten years earlier when she wasn't a part of the  company, sexually harasses him. He now finds himself in a serious  predicament. How can he keep his current position, how can he address the  issue of harassment by a female superior, and can he find the underlying  political reasons why he has been placed in this situation? The novel also  includes some interesting discussions about the use of virtual reality in  obtaining computer data. There is an interesting statistic given in the  novel. About 5% of all the reported cases of sexual harassment are made by  men with respect to female supervisors. That doesn't sound like much. Yet,  only about 5% of top-level executives in the U. S. today are women. This  suggests that the rate of harassment by women is the same as for men.  Sexual harassment is about misuse of power and is independent of the gender  of the person with the power.	1999-06-21

The author  is obviously structuring his book on the epic of &quot;Beowulf&quot; (but,  the historical Beowulf lived in the sixth century, not the tenth). The book  shows some nice interplay between two widely different cultures. In a way,  I viewed the second half of the novel not so much as a version of  &quot;Beowulf,&quot; but simply as a conflict between the Vikings and a  strange Neolithic people (possibly the last of the Neanderthals?).

But, the results are unexpected when the  patient discovers that he can get the impulse on demand. There are villains  in this novel not usually mentioned: the physicians who set up and  performed the procedure on the main character. The neurologists and  neurosurgeons clearly had not done the necessary preliminary studies before  the procedure was to be attempted on a human. This is a major topic of  discussion in bioethics even today.	1999-06-18

In this novel, scientists use cloning, PCR techniques, and amphibian development to isolate dinosaur DNA from insects trapped in amber and to grow living dinosaurs for the ultimate in amusement parks. To garner  support for the park, the developer has asked a number of scientists to  visit and to evaluate the facilities and animals. One of these individuals  is a mathematician whose field of expertice is chaos and catastrophe  theory. Thus, the readers learns a little about molecular biology,  paleontology, paleobotany, and an exciting new area of mathematics (a  common characteristic of Dr. Crichton's novels that I find enjoyable is the  education one receives over a wide area of topics). However, things go  wrong and the reader is soon caught up in the adventure. But, I should  point out that both the book and the 1994 film make some serious scientific  errors, particularly in biochemistry and molecular biology. (For example,  Dr. Crichton has his characters insert a genetic &quot;flaw&quot; into the  DNA of the dinosaurs so that, if a dinosaur would escape, it could not  survive in the \\"wild.\\" The dinosaurs are made to be incapable of  biosynthesizing the amino acid lysine. However, humans [and other mammals]  also can't synthesize lysine! Lysine is one of the nutritionally essential  amino acids [just ask any body builder who often supplement their diets  with lysine tablets]. Nevertheless, humans are able to survive without this  metabolic pathway!) But note that, even with thses flaws, I still gave the  book five stars. These errors (and the &quot;nonerrors&quot;) get readers  to thinking about these exciting new fields of human endeavor. And, they  start searching for the answers themselves. I see students doing this all  the time. Crichton should be applauded. The book and the film also  demonstrate the problems with uncontrolled genetic engineering.	1999-06-18

A group of scientists are sent down to  unravel the mystery which includes a discussion of black holes and time.  However, a series of unusual events begin to occur.

John Wyndham was the pseudonym of John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris (1903-1969). This novel is regarded as one of the classics of science fiction literature and was made into a film in 1963 (poorly made). The book  was runnerup for the 1952 International Fantasy Award. It is one of the  classic examples of the &quot;disaster novel;&quot; or, more specifically,  the sub-genre referred to as the &quot;cozy catastrophe&quot; in which a  world-wide disaster is depicted in such a manner that the reader doesn't  feel too upset and roots for the main character to overcome all odds. This  novel set the pattern for many later novels of other authors: a disaster  occurs, a large city is depopulated, panic develops, bravery is seen in the  main characters, and a small core of individuals strive to build a  foundation from which mankind can reestablish his position. (The synopsis  given above with the publisher's comments is wrong. Wyndham is not the  father of the disaster nove. There were several prior to 1951.) In this  particular story, a series of green showers from a comet's tail (we are  later told that this may have been a weapon in orbit that had been  accidentally set off by an Earth government) cause most of Earth's  inhabitants to become blind. Only the few who didn't see the showers (such  as the main character Bill Mason who was in a hospital) can see. Later, a  plague (possibly originating from a biological weapon) kills many  survivors. But, the main malevolent force in the novel are the triffids:  carniverous plants that can walk. Bill Mason believes these plants to have  been genetically engineered by the Soviet Union and were accidentally  released. Now that mankind is blind, the triffids &quot;day&quot; has come.  The word &quot;triffid,&quot; first used in this novel, has even gotten  into the English language as a term describing any malevolent or obnoxious  plant.	1999-06-17

Hecuba was the wife of Priam, King of Troy, and the mother of Hector, Paris, Cassandra, and others. At the start of this play of Euripedes, the war between the Greeks and Troy is over and Hecuba is now a slave of  Agamemnon. The ghost of Achilles had appeared and demanded a sacrifice over  his tomb before the Greeks can set sail for home. They vote to sacrifice  Polyxena, Hecuba's young daughter, despite the tears and entreaties of  Hecuba. After Polyxena's noble death, Hecuba learns that her last child  Polydorus had been murdered by the King of Thrace, Polymestor, to whom  Polydorus had been sent for safe keeping.

Euripedes shows in this play  the effects of war and vengence on innocent lives and how cruel men at war  can be.	1999-06-17

When I was in high school several years ago, this was one of the books required in one of my English classes. And, upon going through the many reviews below, I find that it is still a required book for today's  students. But, several appear to find Crane's novel &quot;boring,&quot;  &quot;difficult to read,&quot; and nothing that they can &quot;relate  to.&quot; I heard many of the same things in the early 1960s. But, then I  found myself in an environment not too dissimilar of the main character of  the novel. It suddenly became relevent and real. Crane's depiction of war  and the thoughts of young men at war, both willing and unwilling, will  always be relevant. This novel is the psychological study of a young  soldier and his first encounters with the brutality seen in battle (many  critics have regarded this book as the first modern war novel). The unnamed  battle in the novel is probably Chancellorsville (1863). The young  infantryman, Henry Fielding, faces his first battle wanting to prove  himself a hero. However, when the battle is actually thrust upon him, he is  overcome by fear and he runs. He joins the wounded but he has not won their  &quot;red badge of courage.&quot; He sees his friend Jim Conklin killed and  he becomes enraged, particularly at the injustice of war. (I remember  noting the significance of the initials J. C. for the soldier's friend;  but, I later discovered that this observation was not original. The novel  is filled with imagery. For example, even the horsemen of the apocalypse  make an appearance.) This is a great novel and I hope it remains on reading lists for  years to come.	1999-06-17

An obstetrician has been accused of performing an illegal abortion in Boston in the late 1960's. A pathologist discovers that the girl, who died in the  emergency room of a hospital, wasn't even pregnant. He sets out to clear  his friend of the charges. Although some of the discussions on abortion may  seem dated, this is still a good mystery. Michael Crichton originally  published this book under the pseudonym Jeffrey Hudson. Some earlier  reviewers have suggested that he did this because of the controversy  generated by the topic of abortion. While this undoubtedly was a factor, we  also have to recall that this was his first book and Crichton was a medical  student in Massachusetts at the time he wrote much of this book. I'm not  sure if his faculty would have been too keen on having a student devote a  significant fraction of his time to writing a novel instead of to his  studies, had they known. But, I may be wrong. Some other reviewers gave it  a low rating because it contained too much jargon. Of course, that is a  trademark of this category of books; however, I seem to miss the jargon in  this novel. Perhaps I missed it but &quot;A Case of Need&quot; seems to be  the least technical of Crichton's books.	1999-06-17

I find myself surprised at the comments provided by earlier reviewers. One critic gave &quot;Great Expectations&quot; one star because he/she failed a test. Why should Dickens be blamed for that? Another said there was no  structure (in a Dickens novel???). Another, that there was &quot;little  direction and less power.&quot; That there was no theme and no plot.  Perhaps I am seeing things that aren't there but, whatever the shortcomings  are, it is not in plot, themes, or characterization. It is the story of the  orphan Philip Pirrip, known to everyone as Pip, from the age of about seven  to the age of twenty-three, with a brief section at the end that takes  place about eleven years later. Pip is being brought up \\"by hand\\" by his  loud and quarrelsome sister and her kind and quiet husband, the blacksmith  Joe Gargery. Young Pip is soon asked to serve in the home of Miss Havisham,  who appears to be half mad since the day, years earlier, when she had been  left at the alter by her old lover. Miss Havisham is raising a young girl  named Estella to be heartless in her treatment of men when she grows up as  a form of revenge against all men. And, Pip naturally falls in love with  her. After a few years, Pip finds himself wealthy due to some unknown  benefactor (who he mistakenly thinks is Miss Havisham and who he also  believes has planned to have Estella marry him when they are older) and he  now has \\"great expectations\\" made of him. He plans to become a gentleman  and he leaves the kind and devoted Joe to live in London, Pip hoping to  leave behind his humble past of which he now feels ashamed. After a few  more years, he discovers that his unknown benefactor was Abel Magwitch whom  he had helped when he was seven. Magwitch had been convicted and deported  to Australia where he became a wealthy sheepman. Even though Magwitch was  forbidden to return to England, he does so just to see the young man he had  been helping to become a gentleman. Through problems with the law trying to  arrest Magwitch, problems with Magwitch's past, the loss of the fortune and  of Pip's great expectations, and through illness, Pip discovers the basic  goodness in Joe, the devotion of Magwitch and of Pip's close friend Herbert  Pocket, and what really is important.

This classic novel won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. This tale is centered around the social life of the upper class in New York City starting in the 1870's. It was also made into a film in 1992. The principle  character is a young lawyer, Newland Archer, who becomes the fiance of May  Welland. However, just before the engagement is announced, he meets May's  cousin Ellen Olenska. Social taboos in New York society cause her to be  nearly ostracized (she is separated from a dissolute Polish count). Archer  is intelligent enough to be aware of his position in the society in which  he moves. He falls in love with Ellen but it is too late to withdraw his  engagement to May. Now forced to marry May, he finds himself trapped by the  conditions and conventions of society. The conventions of the society in  which he has been raised prevents him from truly following his heart. Years  later, after May has died, Newland visits Paris with his son. Ellen invites  them to visit her. At the last moment, he sits on the street outside her  apartment and sends Dallas, his son, in alone. Apparently, though he is now  free, he prefers his ideal vision of the Ellen of his past rather than the  reality of the present. He slowly walks away without seeing her.

However, they are less heroic and more realistic  then the way they are portrayed by Aeschylus and Sophocles. Electra has  been given as a wife to a peasant who, although he is poor, realizes he is  beneath her in station and does not touch her. Electra is constantly  bemoaning her fate and prays for the return of her brother. Orestes appears  in disguise to learn all that is happening around Argos and what has become  of his sister. Electra finally recognizes him and they plan the death of  Aegisthus and of their mother, Clytemnestra. But, Orestes is reluctant to  commit matricide. Nevertheless, Electra drives him to it, even though, at  the crucial moment, she herself is unable to deliver the killing stroke.  Interestingly, the one truly noble and honest character in the play is the  peasant. Was Euripides making a social comment about the upper classes of  Athens of his time?	1999-06-17

Science fiction stories about aliens that form a symbiotic relationship with humans have been popular in the science fiction literature for a long time. One of the earliest short stories on this theme probably was Clark  Ashton Smith's &quot;The Vaults of Yok-Vombis&quot; in 1932. The first full  length novel based on this theme was Heinlein's &quot;The Puppet  Masters.&quot; It was also Heinlein's first full-length science fiction  novel for adults. It first appeared as a serial in the Sept. 1951 issue of  Galaxy magazine. A film based on this book was released in 1994. This  story, written in a very &quot;hard-boiled&quot; style reminescent Raymond  Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, begins with a landing of a flying saucer in  Iowa. At first it is thought to be a hoax (as in Wells' \\"War of the  Worlds\\"). However, it is soon apparent that it is not. The aliens, believed  to be from Titan, form a parasitic attachment to humans and are able to  completely control the thoughts and movements of the human host. The  problems facing the non-infected humans includes how to defeat the aliens  without killing the host (a similar problem facing the hero in Card's  &quot;Xenocide&quot; (1991)). They also have a problem at convincing  Washington politicians that there is a crisis. Others have suggested that  the novel is an allegory of the times in the late-1940s and early-1950s of  the paranoia caused by the Cold War. (However, care should be exercised  here. Some of the earlier reviewers have compared this book with the  paranoa associated with the McCarthy hearings. Although Senator McCarthy  was much in the news in 1950 and 1951, the actual hearings didn't begin  until long after Heinlein's book was published.) There is another  interesting aspect. The novel is written in the first person. On two  occasions, the narrator himself, the government agent Sam Cavanaugh, gets  infected by the aliens and then the narration shifts to the alien's  viewpoint. This was a major novel inthe history of the development of  science fiction literature and all serious students should read it.	1999-06-17

This play is regarded by many as Euripedes' masterpiece and should be required reading of all educated people. It retells the tragic story of Medea, who had helped Jason in his quest, became his wife, gave him two  sons, and feels betrayed since he is marrying the daughter of the ruler of  Corinth (Jason has come to the conclusion that this is necessary to protect  Medea and his sons since she is a barbarian). With horrible vengence, she  kills the bride and the king and then kills her two sons. Euripedes depicts  how much passion and vengence can overcome not only individuals, but those  who strive to be rational. Men (and governments) can't ignore the influence  of emotion, and even irrationality, on their decisions and actions, even  when those actions may seem rational and just.  Man has to remain flexible.  The play also shows how emotions, anger, and unbridled fury can cause a  person to do stupid and irrational acts. Euripedes is undoubtedly warning  Athens with respect to the war that is going on with Sparta.	1999-06-17

As Hercules lies  dying, he orders his son Hyllus to marry Iole. Does Hercules truly love  Iole? Even when dying, he is concerned for her future. In  &quot;Electra,&quot; the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra awaits the  return of her brother Orestes so that he can avenge the murder of their  father. I think that many scholars have tended to misread this play. It is  a play about Electra, not about Orestes or Clytemnestra or Aegisthus. And,  it is a tragedy. Should one allow hatred to rule their own lives to such an  extent as seen in Electra, even when one is in the right? Finally,  &quot;Philoctetes,&quot;  a member of a group of plays that won first prize  in Athens, is concerned with a man who has been left marooned on an island  several years earlier (because of his disease) under orders of Agamemnon  and Menelaus. But, the two kings later discover that Troy cannot be  conquered without Philoctetes and his bow, a bow given to him by Heracles.  Odysseus and Neoptolemus (the son of the late Achilles) arrive at the  island to persuade or trick Philoctetes to return with them. Neoptolemus  wants to be noble in his actions; yet, his commander, Odysseus, wants to  use guile. At the end, a deus-ex-machina device is used to resolve the  conflict.

But, &quot;Triffids&quot; came out in 1951, and  Wyndham still chose &quot;Earth Abides.&quot;). The name  &quot;Isherwood&quot; is a direct reference to Ishi, the last surviving  member of a California Indian tribe who was brought to the University by  Kroeber of the Anthropology Department (many science fiction enthusiasts  are very familiarwith Kroeber's daughter, Ursula K. Le Guin). Ishi is  still quite famous in the study of native American cultures. This book has  had such an impact in the development of the science fiction genre that it  is now required reading for all serious students of science fiction and  speculative literature.	1999-06-16

It relates one day  in the life of a prisoner, a carpenter who had been imprisoned on baseless  charges, in a labor camp in Siberia in the Soviet Union under Stalin.

Sophocles is the earliest known playwright to use painted scenery. He also decreased the importance of the chorus, added a third actor, and abandoned  the trilogy format (each play is complete by itself). Ajax is the classical  Greek tragedy about the downfall of a man who is sinned against and has a  tragic flaw; in this case, insolence and pride. Ajax becomes enraged when  Achilles' armor is awarded to Odysseus instead of to him. Agamemnon and  Menelaus also exhibit insolence when they refuse to bury Ajax after his  suicide. But, Odysseus changes their minds. This play is probably the  earliest known example of a play containing a scene of violence on the  stage instead of offstage.

Most of these stories appeared in mainstream magazines and  contain fantasy or science fiction elements, often with some humor and a  twist in the story. Although many of the stories now appear dated, it is  only because Collier has had so many \\"descendents.\\" The collection is also  of interest to young writers as it can serve as a source for new ideas.

This classic novel by Clark is a superb study of mob rule; of how normal men can allow their inner anger and authoritarianism to control their judgment and honesty. The story is told in the first person by Art Croft, a  trailhand who rides into the small Nevada town of Bridger's Wells in 1885  with his friend Gil Carter. The first chapter (there are only five  chapters) has all of the structure of a typical western novel (bar, poker  game, fight), yet when a young rider arrives to say that some cattle have  been stolen and a man killed, the story about how men let anger goad their  actions sets the novel apart from other westerns. It is a true classic. In  1977 the Western Writers of America named it one of the top twenty-five  western novels of all time (it was ranked second after Wister's &quot;The  Virginian&quot;). The book was also made into a classic film starring Henry  Fonda. I recommend this book highly. I really don't understand the comments  of the reviewer from Massachusetts (of Jan. 10, 1999).

This short novel was the winner of the 1953 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. It was required reading in one of my high school English classes and is still required in many schools over thirty to years later. Many believe it was  the publication of this book that assured Hemingway of winning the 1954  Nobel Prize in Literature. This book is a parable of man's struggle with  the natural world and the inherent dignity of a man. An old Cuban fisherman  named Santiago takes his small boat out into the Gulf of Mexico and has a  battle with a giant marlin and with several sharks. He has to deal with his  own weaknesses, with nature, with loneliness, and with his own mortality.  It is a great novel and a reader can get much out of it with a little  effort. I also feel that I have to respond to some of the comments from  those earlier reviewers who rated the book with low scores. The book isn't  about fishing. It's about man. Hemingway hadn't written a book for ten  years. But, as soon as this comes out, he picks up a Pulitzer Award and the  Nobel Prize! An earlier reviewer from Kansas (May 30, 1999) commented that  Hemingway was no Jack Kerouac or F. Scott Fitzgerald. I love both those  writers; but, they weren't even nominated for the Nobel. And, to the  Canadian reviewer of March 29, do you actually think that Philip Pullman  himself would classify his works, as enjoyable as they are, greater than  those of Ernest Hemingway? But my most impassioned response is to the  bizarre comments of the reviewer of May 11, who awarded &quot;The Old Man  and the Sea&quot; five stars. After reading his comments, I went through  all of the earlier comments, attempting to find what he was referring to.  Except for grammatical errors (such as ending my previous sentence with a  preposition) or spelling mistakes (such as misspelling mispelling), I saw  nothing crude or offensive. Don't we have freedom of expression here? Even  though I may disagree with others comments and opinions, they still have  this right. And, more power to them (and to amazon.com). But, what I found  most bizarre from reading this person's comments was that it would appear,  from reading his last sentence, he awarded the book five stars yet hadn't  even read it! At least those who gave the text a low rating had actually  read the book.	1999-06-14

George serves as the \\"guide\\" or father-figure for the simpleminded, large, and strong Lennie.  Both have dreams of having their own place and farm; but, tragedy stops  them. As they reach for their dream, they are denied (\\"The best laid  schemes o' mice and men Gang aft a gley,\\" Robert Burns, 1785). George finds  that he is so attached to Lennie that he can't let the mob get to him. He  discovers that it is his terrible task to free Lennie by the only means  available to him. Steinbeck gained national prominance with this work with  its beautiful use of language and its realistic portrayal of itinerate farm  workers in the 1930s. He was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature. It  is one of the major works of literature of the twentieth century.	1999-06-14

This book is an episodic novel centered on the Macauley family in the town of Ithaca, California, in the San Joaquin Valley in the early 1940s (Saroyan [1908-1981] was born in Fresno, California, and much of what he  describes of the life of Ithaca relates to Fresno). The central characters  are the fourteen-year-old Homer Macauley, who is working as a telegraph  messenger, and his four-year-old brother Ulysses (note the names of Homer,  Ulysses, and Ithaca!). Through them we see the people and the vitality of  this small community and the impact of World War II. The war is having a  deep effect on Homer because he finds himself acting as a \\"Messenger of  Death\\" since he has to deliver telegrams to family members from the  Government informing them of the death of a loved one. This book appeared  in 1943 in the middle of the war and, in my opinion, much of its popularity  is due to the comfort it gave to many families throughout the U.S. who had  family members in the armed forces overseas. Families of widely different  backgrounds and heritages as well as entire communities were holding  together in this time of strain and concern just as Ithaca was doing. [One  minor character in the book is Big Chris, who appears a couple of times in  the book, always acting as a guide or \\"savior.\\" Was Saroyan trying to say  here that He is always there in times of need?

This book by the Canadian naturalist Farley Mowat, which was made into a film in 1983, is an account, often humorous, of Mowat's study of the natural behavior of the arctic wolf in the treeless environs of northern  Canada in the late 1940s. He had been sent up there to study the wolf and  bring back data on how much the wolf population had been the apparent cause  of the large decline in the caribou population. What he discovered was a  detailed family life and the controversial observation that there no threat  at all for the caribou (or to humans) from the wolves. This book is a  classic in conservation literature. It shows the love man has of nature and  how we should protect it. As most ranchers will tell you, coyotes are much  more of a problem than wolves and wolves help keep the coyote population  down.	1999-06-12

This is generally not considered one of the better plays of Aeschylus; yet, I did enjoy it, even though there is very little action. Perhaps it is because it dealt with a subject of contemporary interest to its original  audience. In fact, it is the oldest surviving play based on an event of  recent history. The play was first produced in 472 B. C., only eight years  after the Battle of Salamis. The speech by the Messenger in the play is the  earliest known historical account of that battle. The play takes place in  the Persian court and simply presents the arrival of a messenger carrying  the news of Persia's defeat and is followed by the entry of a disgraced  Xerxes. This play also contains the earliest known appearance by a ghost in  a drama.	1999-06-12

This is the first great prose work in European literature and the first history text. Herodotus is a volume that should be required reading for all educated men and women. The edition I read, and recommend, is the  translation by Aubrey de Selincourt of Penguin Books. &quot;The  Histories&quot; is an account, which I found very entertaining, of what led  up to the war between the Greek city-states and the Persians under Darius  and Xerxes resulting in the battles of Marathon (490 B.C.), Salamis (480  B.C.), and Plataea (479 B.C.). Scholars often seem to keep forgetting that  Herodotus was also a great storyteller, even if he gets his dates wrong,  has little military experience (hence, his descriptions of the battles  leaves much to be desired), and often relies on untrustworthy sources.  However, he never intentionally misleads the reader. He usually informs the  reader if some information is hearsay or untrustworthy. The text is divided  into nine books. Book I  deals primarily with the conflicts the Greeks had  with their neighbors, leading to the Trojan War. It also contains an  account of the conquest of Lydia by Croesus (and Solon's famous visit) and  the establishment of the Persian Empire. Book II is mainly concerned with  Egypt and Book III deals with the reign of Cambyses over Egypt and the rise  of Darius. Book IV is concerned with the beginning of Darius' campaign  against Scythia and his conquest of Lybia. Book V discusses the reduction  of the Scythians in Thrace and the beginning of the Ionian revolt against  Persia. Book VI reports on the progress of the war down to the victory of  the Greeks at Marathon. Books VII to IX cover the death of Darius, the  preparation of the army of Xerxes, the march across the Hellespont, the  battles of Thermopylae and Salamis, and the final defeat of the Persians at  Plataea and at Mycale.	1999-06-12

This is the third play in a trilogy, the other two being lost. The play results in an end to the curse on the Oedipus family. However, it is different from the approach later used by Sophocles. Here, there is no  redemption from within. The curse ends only when the family becomes  extinct. The two sons of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polyneices, who were to  share power in Thebes, have quarrelled. Eteocles seizes power and  Polyneices goes to get help from Adrastus, King of Argos, and six other  kings. Eteocles sends champions to fight the six kings at six of the gates  of Thebes. The seventh gate is left to Eteocles. However, that is the gate  to which his brother comes. Eteocles feels that he has no choice but to  fight and further incur the wrath of the gods by shedding kindred blood.  &quot;When the gods send destruction there is no escape.&quot; Eteocles had  an &quot;out&quot; of his predicament but he choses not to use it. One  really sees the pains of conflict and war in this play.	1999-06-12

This novel by Keyes has a rather unique background. A shorter version won the 1960 Hugo Award for best science fiction \\"short fiction\\" of the year (it had appeared in the April 1959 issue of the \\"Magazine of Fantasy and  Science Fiction\\") and has been anthologized a number of times. This short  story was made into a television special (&quot;The Two Worlds of Charlie  Gordon&quot;) in 1961 and I believe it won an Emmy Award. The author  expanded the story into a novel which was voted a tie for the 1966 Nebula  Award for best science fiction novel by the Science Fiction Writers of  America (it tied with Samuel Delany's \\"Babel 17\\" and beat out Robert  Heinlein's \\"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\\"). It also received a nomination  for the 1967 Hugo Award, losing to Heinlein's novel. It was then made into  a film (&quot;Charly&quot;) for which Cliff Robertson received the Oscar  Award for best actor for 1968. In 1969, David Rogers wrote a play based on  the novel. In this story, the intelligence of a mentally challenged man is  greatly enhanced by treatments. He forms an attachment with a mouse named  Algernon who has already undergone this same treatment. Charlie is asked to  keep a dairy and the novel consists of his daily reports. As his  intelligence grows Charlie becomes more aware of his status. He soon  develops into a &quot;super genius&quot; and finds he is just as isolated  and lonely as he was before the treatment. {An earlier reviewer (June 5,  1999) from Wisconsin commented that Charlie caused his own loneliness. How  can that be? He was mentally challenged at the start of the novel and,  after his treatments, he did not have the time we all have to develop  social skills. He is not at fault here.) But, he also discovers that it is  only temporary and he has to deal with his upcoming return to mental  retardation. As the years have gone by since I first read this book, I  realize that there is a second issue that should arise whenever discussing  the novel. It concerns the ethics of the researchers who provide the  treatment. They convinced a mentally challenged man, who clearly doesn't  fully understand what is happening, to undergo a treatment that had only  been applied to a single laboratory mouse! These same researchers also  performed the treatment when their understanding of neurochemistry and  neuroanatomy is clearly difficient (as Charlie later shows in the novel).  They are actually the villains of the tale! This is a great story and  provides much insight into our dealings with others, how different people  look at the world, our interactions with the mentally challenged, and in  bioethics. I highly recommend it.	1999-06-12

In this play, Shakespeare is widely regarded as having authored most of Acts I and V whereas Fletcher did the rest. Other scholars have suggested a more even distribution of the writing. It is a tragi-comedy based on  Chaucer's &quot;Knight's Tale&quot; and takes place in Athens when Theseus  ruled. Two Theban prisoners, Arcite and Palamon, see the sister-in-law of  Theseus, Emily, and both fall in love with her. This causes a break in the  friendship of the two cousins. In the last act they fight for the honor of  Emily's hand. One significant difference from the Chaucer tale is the  presence of the jailor's daughter who falls in love with Palamon. She goes  a little mad from her unrequited love but is cured by a lower class man  pretending to be Palamon. The play is rarely produced today and does not  come up to the lofty standards of the other works of Shakespeare. In fact,  I suspect that more people have read Chaucer's version than Shakespeare's  and Fletcher's. Nevertheless, it is a play that an educated person should  read.	1999-06-10

This is the first novel in the adventures of John Carter on Mars (#1 in the Barsoom series), where Mars is referred to as Barsoom. These novels contain great creations of flora and fawna. I first read all the books in  this series when I was in high school in the early 1960s and they are just  as much fun now as they were then. And, my Dad loved this series when he  was a teenager as well. This book is regarded as a classic and landmark in  the history of the science fiction novel. Any serious student of science  fiction literature should be very familiar with them. The story opens up in  1865. The U. S. Civil War has just ended and the former Confederate officer  John Carter has traveled west to Arizona with a friend to prospect for  gold. Although successful initially, they are attacked by Indians. Carter's  friend dies and he finds himself cornered inside a cave. Carter awaits the  final attack but is perplexed when the Indians fail to do so. Moments  later, Carter finds himself transported from Arizona to the desert sea  bottoms of Mars, called Barsoom by its natives (this transportation to Mars  via a type of astral projection or teleportation was an early example of  such transportation methods appearing in science fiction literature).  Carter soon finds that he has great leaping abilities and comes in contact  with tall, green, nomadic warriors with six limbs. He also finds humans  like himself, albeit with red skin and more advanced scientifically. Carter  soon befriends a captive red woman, named Dejah Thoris, who is a princess  of Helium. He takes on the task of returning the princess to her people. In  the accomplishment of this task, Carter learns much about the world of  Barsoom and much about Dejah Thoris. A great adventure tale that has  remained popular for more than four score years.	1999-06-10

Golding was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in  Literature. I found it surprising to learn that a number of reference books  lists &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as a science fiction novel! I later  discovered that the first draft of the book had the boys fleeing from a  nuclear holocaust at the start of the novel. Even in this final version  there is a brief discussion of the &quot;bomb&quot; and about fighting  &quot;Reds.&quot; In the novel, after a plane crashes on a deserted island,  the surviving boys of a boys school try to set up a democratic society,  waiting for rescue. At first, the boys cooperate and Ralph, with his friend  \\"Piggy,\\" tries to maintain order. But, it fails and the boys  &quot;evolve&quot; (or, devolve) back into savagery. It is only with the  arrival of a shocked rescue officer does a semblance of civilization  returns. The boys in the novel have the same names as the schoolboy heroes  in R. M. Ballantyne's &quot;The Coral Island,&quot; published in 1858. But,  Ballantyne's novel is &quot;naive optimism.&quot; Golding suggests that the  evil is in each of us and that, left on our own, man will always have a  tendency to revert to savagery. Is this really what underlies man's true  nature? There is goodness and discipline in us and that is represented by  Ralph. We just need more Ralphs.-----\\"Fancy thinking the Beast was  something you could hunt and kill!\\" said the head. For a moment or two the  forest and all the other dimly appreciated places echoes with the parody of  laughter. \\"You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you? Close, close, close!

This is the fifth book in the Lucky Starr series, originally published under the pseudonym Paul French. In this volume, Starr and Bigman Jones travel to a moon of Jupiter to discover the cause of a series of accidents  on a secret project to develop a space craft with an antigravity engine.  They uncover a spy of Earth's enemy, Sirius. Jupiter IX is called Adrastea  in the novel; however, now Adrastea is referred to as Jupiter XV (more (16)  satellites are known now than were known in 1957). It is one of the closest  moons to Jupiter's surface and could not be the moon referred to in the  novel. In an introduction written in 1978, Asimov apologizes for some of  the scientific inaccuracies in the story due to all of the new information  that had been discovered since 1957. Besides the number of moons, Jupiter's  magnetosphere would present severe difficulties to space travelers. The  intense radiation field that surrounds Jupiter would be fatal to travelers  unless some new method is available to counter the problem. It is also  doubtful that the characters would have landed on Io due to its large  degree of volcano activity (there are at least eight active volcanos).  There is also evidence that Io forms a ring (or torus) around Jupiter  consisting of ionized sulfur and oxygen. In 1989, it was discovered from  infrared spectroscopy using Earth-based equipment that Io has hydrogen  sulfide on its surface. The characters in the novel also land on Amalthea  (Jupiter V). This moon, discovered in 1892, is small and has a low orbit.  Also unknown in either 1957 and 1978 was the fact that Jupiter has a single  faint ring encircling the planet, a ring not detected by Earth-based  observatories.	1999-06-09

Once again, in an introduction written in 1978, Asimov  apologizes for the scientific inaccuracies that crop up due to recent  discoveries of the planet Mercury (of facts not known in 1956). The most  obvious of these is the rotation of Mercury about its axis. Until the  mid-1970s, it was believed that Mercury's rotation was such that it always  presented the same face towards the Sun. Thus, one side of Mercury is  extremely hot while the other side is very cold. It was thought at that  time that there would be a small region between the two  &quot;hemispheres&quot; that would have acceptible temperatures for a  colony in the distant future. But space studies, particularly the Mariner  10 probe of 1974/1975, showed that this first planet from the Sun does  indeed rotate (at a sidereal period of 58.6462 days). Since Mercury  revolves around the sun in about 88 days, all of the planet's surface will  get exposed to direct sunlight. However, the days and nights will be long.  Both stories are good adventure tales for youth, even if outdated.	1999-06-09

Of course the  surface pressure of Mercury isn't 1.0 atm (it is estimated to be above  10-13 bars).	1999-06-09

This is the classic story by Wister (1860-1938) of the ranch foreman, known only as the Virginian, his courtship of Molly Starkwood, the &quot;schoolmarm&quot; from Vermont, and his conflicts with Trampas. In  1977, the Western Writers of America voted this novel as the top western  novel of all time. It probably started the whole genre (even if one counts  the pulp fiction popular in the late 19th century). Historians have always  pointed out that there never really was a \\"Code of the West.\\" This was just  something thought up by writers, journalists, and film makers. The West was  made up of both good and bad men, just as today. But, in my opinion, this  book challenges that concept. Wister based his characters on real people he  interacted with in the West a few years earlier. There really were men like  the Virginian. There really were people who, unknowingly, followed a Code  (just as there are today).	1999-06-09

A secret agent for Earth's enemy, Sirius, has stolen some intelligence and escaped  to the moons of Saturn. Lucky Starr and his friend Bigman race to Saturn  only to discover an enemy base set up on Titan, Saturn's largest moon.  Somehow they have to return to Earth and force the Sirians out of the Solar  System without starting an interstellar war. The story line in Asimov's  novel involves the settling of an &quot;enemy&quot; of Earth within Earth's  region of space. It's amazing how close Asimov was to an analogous  situation in recent history. A short while after this book appeared, there  was a revolution in Cuba which resulted in the Soviet Union having an ally  close to the U.S. mainland. More moons are now known to orbit Saturn than  were known in 1958; there are at least twenty satellites. In the novel, two  moons play central roles: Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons, and Mimas,  which Asimov (in 1958) states is the moon closest to the planet. However,  we now know of closer moons. A photograph of Mimas taken by a fly-by probe  shows a giant impact crater having a diameter about one-third that of  Mimas. The crater, now named Hershel, has walls of about 16000 feet in  height and a central mountain reaching up to 20000 feet. Just as in  Asimov's novel,  Mimas appears to be made up of mostly water ice, with  20%-to-50% rock. Titan has a substantial atmosphere, mostly nitrogen with  some methane.	1999-06-09

In the 1950's, Isaac Asimov, writing under the pseudonym Paul French (later the books were republished under the Asimov name), wrote six science fiction novels for teenagers about a young agent of the &quot;Council of  Science,&quot; an organization which has considerable power in a world in  the distant future. The agent, David Starr, travels throughout the Solar  System to combat crime and to protect Earth. Asimov was using these stories  to teach the readers facts about the Solar System. Nevertheless, in an  introduction written in 1978, Asimov apologizes for the science  inaccuracies in this first volume that are now apparent after all of the  space probes to Mars. But, as of 1952, it was accurate. (Actually, this  introduction to a later reprinting of a science fiction novel is rather  unique. I can not recall another author who makes an effort to point out  the changes scientific investigation have provided since the original  publication of a story. Asimov should be commended for this. In so doing,  he continues to teach.) In this first story, David Starr must discover who  is the cause of a series of fatal poisonings on Earth and who is  blackmailing the farms on Mars. In so doing, he accidentally comes in  contact with ancient Martians living beneath the surface.	1999-06-08

My father always enjoyed reading the novels in this detective series which were very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. So, I decided to read some as well. But, they seem to be hard to come across. I believe that this novel  was the last that the author wrote. All of the books in this series are  centered about a private detective named Shell Scott, an ex-marine with a  bleached-blond crewcut. The first book in the series (there were more than  forty) was published in 1950: &quot;The Case of the Vanishing Beauty&quot;.  &quot;Shellshock&quot; begins when Scott is asked by a friend of his, an  attorney in Arizona, to take on an unusual assignment. The attorney's  client has to find a daughter that he had abandoned years earlier. And  Scott has to do it without knowing the daughter's full name, without using  the client's name, and do it discretely in only a few days. In addition,  because of the client's former criminal past and current associates, there  are men attempting to stop Scott from completeing his task. Interestingly,  it is mentioned in the novel that Scott is thirty years old in this novel.  That would mean that, when Scott had his first published case in 1950, he  hadn't even been born yet! Of course, we readers probably shouldn't read  that much into these serials. The Shell Scott stories are probably required  reading for serious students of the sub-genre of hard-boiled, private eye  novels.	1999-06-08

It was required reading for many students when I was in high school in the early 1960s. My Father read it in college in the early 1950s. It's required in many courses at Universities  today. And, I discovered that eighth graders were reading it in a local  school just this last year! The book, contrary to the opinions of those  earlier reviewers who gave it a poor rating, is still a major classic. It  is not only studied in literature courses, but also in classes in political  science, history, semantics, and even advertising. It is an extrapolation  of the grim world predicted by Orwell if totalitarianism and the perfect  police state gain true power. This is an important work to read. Abuse and  manipulation of power is a timeless topic. In the world of this novel,  power is the only thing that counts. [Note that there is another book that  readers might be interested in. Orwell used it as a &quot;stepping  stone.&quot; The book is &quot;We&quot; by Yevgeny Zamiatin (or, Zamyatin)  first published in 1924.] Personally, I also find the whole subject on how  language is used to alter people's thoughts (and even the direction of  their thoughts) is fascinating. The presentation provides considerable  insight into journalism, political speeches, political correctness, and  advertising. (Newspeak: &quot;The purpose of Newspeak was not only to  provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper  to devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought  impossible.&quot;) Many of the words coined by Orwell have become quite  common (for example, doublespeak, crimethink, newspeak, etc.) Winston Smith  is a worker in the Ministry of Truth whose job requires him to  &quot;alter&quot; the past by rewriting history (\\"who controls the past,  controls the future\\"). In his world there is no privacy (\\"Big Brother\\" is  always watching), individuals with unorthodox ideas are executed, and  perpetual warfare exists between three global powers (who keep the war  going to keep their populations controlled). The Thought Police attempt to  control people's minds by what they see, hear, and experience. When Winston  falls in love (a crime) with Julia, the Party tries to destroy this  &quot;crimethink.&quot; Smith's \\"reeducation\\" destroys his individuality  and spirituality. The &quot;place where there is no darkness&quot; is not  the light of Truth. It is the light in the torture room in the Ministry of  Love.	1999-06-05

This fantasy tale is actually a prequel or predecessor to Tolkein's famous epic, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is required reading for any serious student of fantasy or speculative fiction and I recommend it  enthusiastically. J. R. R. Tolkein (1892-1973) was a noted philologist who  was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford  University as well as a close friend of C. S. Lewis. &quot;The  Hobbit,&quot; originally a story written for children, is a tale of the  hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and how he helps a wizard named Gandalf and a group  of dwarves in their quest when traveling through a land known as  Middle-Earth. Hobbits are little people who are smaller than dwarves, don't  have beards, live in holes in the ground, and don't wear shoes. They have  hairy feet which have leathery soles. One day, Bilbo is visited by Gandalf  and his adventures began. The following day a group of thirteen dwarves,  led by Thorin Oakenshield, visited Bilbo with Gandalf. They planned to  travel to the Lonely Mountain to recover a treasure that had been stolen by  the dragon Smaug many years earlier and they have decided to enlist the aid  of Bilbo. In the travels of this troup, they overcome some trolls, find two  ancient swords, meet friendly elves, and discover a secret message on their  treasure map. They are captured by goblins and rescued by Gandalf. However,  Bilbo is separated from the rest and finds himself alone in a dark cave  where he meets the creature Gollum. After a contest of riddles, Bilbo  escapes Gollum with the aid of a magical ring that he had found in the  cave. Upon rejoining Gandalf and the dwarves, the travelers continue their  trek but are soon attacked by Wargs (evil wolves). They are rescued once  again, this time by giant eagles who fly them to safety. Their adventures  continue until the quest is finally completed.	1999-06-05

But,  on one of his dives, he discovers a great pearl, \\"The Pearl of the World,\\"  and he thinks that all his problems are solved: he and his wife can finally  get married in a church, he can get a new rifle, his son can get treatment  for his scorpion bite from the unscrupulous doctor of the town, and his son  can go to school to learn to read and write.

This novel won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. Pearl Buck also was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize for Literature. &quot;The Good Earth&quot; is actually the first part of a trilogy, the other two books being  &quot;Sons&quot; (published in 1932) and &quot;A House Divided&quot;  (1935). Those later two books apparently were not as popular as &quot;The  Good Earth.&quot; In a way it is surprising that this novel won a Pulitzer  Prize. In the early days of the Prize, the award was supposed to go to the  best novel that characterized aspects of American family life. Here is a  novel about a Chinese peasant, Wang Lung, and his wife O-lan who was once a  kitchen slave! I would bet that the Pulitzer Prize voters generated some  degree of controversy when the awards were first announced. At the  beginning of the novel, the poor Wang Lung travels to a matchmaker to get a  wife, hoping that she isn't ugly and will work hard. O-lan is selected and  the two of them travel back to his farm. They both work hard but are forced  to leave their land due to a famine. Winding up in a city, they soon have  to beg for scraps and Wang Lung quickly finds how much he misses working  his own land. There is a revolt and Wang Lung and O-lan are able to get  money to return to farming. Through their hard work, they become wealthy  but Wang Lung begins to loose touch with the earth that has made him  wealthy. His children also fail to recognize the worth of the soil and even  plan to sell it by the end of the novel. The novel is filled with the  concept of how much we owe the Earth; how much strength we draw from it.  When we separate ourselves from the Earth or, better yet, from Nature, we  begin to loose the vigor that is in our own lives. Wang Lung's own children  appear to loose that vigor since they don't draw upon the earth's strength.  My young friend and Godson was recently required to read this book for  sixth grade. And, he did it! I'm amazed! I had to read it in high school!  And, I find that I enjoyed it more now in my later years than when I was a  teenager.

Blair (1903-1950). He published this short political satire in the mid-1940s and it was required reading for many students when I was in high school in the early 1960s. I even  discovered that it was required reading for eighth graders in one of the  local schools just this last year. It is still having an impact. This  classic fable of animals who take over a farm is a satire of the 1917  Bolshevik Revolution and of Communist rule in the Soviet Union. Since the  U.S.S.R. has now broken up, one might feel that this book is now outdated.  However, I think that is far from the case. First of all, the book is a  part of history. The satire has had an influence on the world's perception  of this form of government (and on any form of totalitarianism). Thus, in a  way, the novel has played a role, perhaps minor, in the ultimate fate of  the Soviet Union. In addition, I find many instances in politics, in other  totalitarian governments, and even in personal interactions in business and  in academia that can be perceived in a new light through this fable. In the  tale, the animals on Mr. Jones's farm revolt and oust their human master.  In the beginning, all the animals have a deep revolutionary zeal and all  attempt to work for the common good. A list of Commandments is formulated  that all are to follow. But, the pigs, led by a pig named Napoleon, begin  to take over the leadership and begin to edit the Commandments for their.  They subvert the Revolution for their own ends and for the sake of power. A  new tyranny has replaced the old. The downtrodden remain the downtrodden.  The pig Napoleon represents the ruthless Stalin and the idealistic Snowball  represents Trotsky. The doomed horse Boxer represents the characteristics  of the common man. But, as mentioned above, the book brings up issues that  go far beyond that of the 1917 revolution. Perhaps the most famous line is  &quot;All the animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than  others.&quot; An earlier reviewer gave the book only a single star, using  this line as an example of how the book was so &quot;dumb&quot; since how  could things be more equal than others. Of course, that was Orwell's point  but it seems to still elude some of our young critics. This is a book that  everyone should read and it is incumbent that teachers get some of Orwell's  points across. There are some reviewers who gave the book a single star  simply because it wasn't realistic in that Orwell used animals as  characters. It is as if these students had never heard of satire, imagery,  allegory, or metaphor. Thank goodness that most of the students writing  comments do not fall into that category.more equal than  others.&quot; An earlier reviewer gave the book only a single star, using  this line as an example of how the book was so &quot;dumb&quot; since how  could things be more equal than others.

There are some reviewers who gave the book a single star  simply because it wasn't realistic in that Orwell used animals as  characters. It is as if these students had never heard of satire, imagery,  allegory, or metaphor. Thank goodness that most of the students writing  comments do not fall into that category.	1999-06-05

This book is one of a number of Professor Challenger adventures of Sir A. C. Doyle. A noted zoologist (Challenger) has come across evidence that there is a plateau in South America that can be reached from deep in the  Amazon rain forest in which prehistoric animals still exist. An expedition  of four (Challenger, a sceptical zoologist named Summerlee, a noted hunter  (Lord John Roxton), and Edward Malone, a journalist) sets out to verify  this report. The arguing and interactions between the academics is  interesting in that little seems to have changed in the last 87 years! It  should be noted that Doyle isolates the plateau so that there is minimal  interaction with the rest of the rain forest (thus, the dinosaurs can't  escape). But, why couldn't the ptereodactyls spread out? This story was one  of the earliest \\"Lost World\\" tales and has been made into a film a number  of times. Other stories in this sub-genre owe much to Doyle and Challenger.	1999-06-05

This is a classic tale about a researcher who, while he was the equivalent of a graduate student in physics, discovers a treatment for making himself invisible (using chemicals and mathematical expressions containing four  dimensions). He quickly discovers how dependent he is on others and that he  doesn't have the power he thought he would. I had always thought, based on  what I had heard about the film based on this book, that the invisibility  process made the researcher (Griffin) mad. However, upon reading the novel,  I find that Griffin is morally and ethically bankrupt long before he takes  the treatment. His initial reasons for becoming invisible is to avoid  paying his rent (as he sneaks out of the building, he sets it on fire as a  &quot;lesson&quot; for his landlord). All he thinks about is himself and to  have power over others. He steals from his father who, since it wasn't his  money, commits suicide. Griffin goes to the funeral simply because it is  expected of him; but, he feels no remorse. He is a man who feels that the  end (his power) justifies the means. Wells clearly has Griffin as the  villian.	1999-06-04

This is a prophetic, both scientifically and socially, novel by Jules Verne that was first published in 1865. Verne was a satiric critic whose novel strongly hints at the future military industrial complex. This story  depicts a club of artillery experts, the Baltimore Gun Club, bemoaning the  end of the U. S. Civil War. The President of the Club, Impey Barbicane,  comes up with a new project: a cannon shot to the moon. The idea for having  passengers comes from a Frenchman. Most of the novel is concerned with the  preparations for the launch which occurs at the end of the book. The story  continues in Verne's sequel, &quot;Round the Moon&quot; (1870). It's  amazing how many things Verne correctly predicted. Verne was perhaps the  first author who attempts to make his novels agree with the science known  at his time, although there are still mistakes. Verne is also making a  number of political points as well in comparing the freedom observed in the  U. S. and the real lack of such freedom in France of the 1860s. Readers  should also note that Walter James Miller has provided an annotated edition  of this novel in 1978 that is excellent.	1999-06-04

This is the first novel describing warfare between planets. Mars is portrayed as a dying world. An invasion, expeditionary force of Martians has landed in southern England, landing first in Woking (about 25 miles  southwest of London), and this event and the destruction caused by the  Martians is seen through the eyes of a writer in speculative philosophy.  This book is probably Wells' most noted work. It was published right after  certain noted astronomical observations had been reported in the  newspapers. Wells refers to his novel as an attack on &quot;human  self-satisfaction.&quot; At that time, Britain was deeply involved in  Empire activities in Africa and India and Wells had presented a story in  which &quot;the tables are turned:&quot; now it is England who suffers  takeover. The book isn't simply a science fiction tale (or, even the first  novel of a war between planets). It leads into a discussion of Britain's  role in the world, of imperialism, and of colonialism. And, to all those  teenagers who thought it was boring and gave it one star, remember that it  was the first novel in a whole sub-genre of science fiction. It appeared in  1898! My goodness, think of the science of that time. Marie Curie's first  paper was only just published in 1897. The first all-metal dirigible first  flew in November of 1897. This is a pioneering novel. And you should read  it as such. Those other books and films you use as examples would not be  what they are without Wells.	1999-06-04

Any serious student of science fiction should  read this play. A factory on an island produces robots (actually, in  today's terminology, the products being made by this factory are androids,  not robots) to do man's labor and to grow his food. But, as the years go  by, governments misuse the robots, having them replace soldiers. Robots  begin to be used in wars everywhere. They rebel and man is exterminated.  However, the robots don't know how to build new robots and discover that  they are doomed to extinction as well. But, the sole two robots of a later  model discover beauty, compassion, and love. They become a new Adam and  Eve. Interestingly, one of the characters in the play builds robots so that  man won't have to work. Yet, he doesn't build any to do his work since it  is something he enjoys doing.	1999-06-04

This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but  his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never  been given credit. I think Verne was the first to write the techno-novel, a  work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel,  Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as  possible.  Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship  that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They  discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a  mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo  once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an  American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous  things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues  Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades  since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the  translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators  inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted  much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I  read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also  annotated. Such an annotated volume can prove to be very helpful to  teenagers getting acquainted with Nemo and his submarine.	1999-06-04

In this allegorical novel, a shipwrecked biologist named Edward Prendick finds himself on a remote island where a physiologist named Moreau is conducting bizarre experiments in the vivisection of animals to generate  new species (for no other purpose than just to do it). The way I view this  novel, Moreau is doing this work simply for his own intellectual enjoyment.  He sees a problem or a concept and is attempting to answer or address it. I  don't think he even cares about publishing what findings he may have so  that others might possibly use his results to improve the state of man. He  simply doesn't care. Morality and ethics do not form a foundation for his  \\"scientific\\" enquiries. And, that is the \\"evil\\" in his work.	1999-06-03

It is a social allegory in which the unnamed hero travels to the year 802701 and finds an Earth completely altered. It appears initially to be a form of utopia but the Traveler soon  discovers that this is far from true. Society has  two classes. The  Morlocks, subterreanean workers, are beings evolved from man that have sunk  to depravity  and who prey on the decadent Eloi. The Eloi are completely  useless beings, totally dependent on the Morlocks. Wells is suggesting a  world in which the two main classes of Britain of the 1890s have degraded  into Morlocks and Eloi. The world of 802701 is the end result of  unrestrained and unchecked class struggles and isolation. The upper class  has degraded to uselessness and the lower class has become buried by their  labor and degenerate into darkness. The term \\"Morlock\\" is derived from the  Biblical word \\"Molech,\\" the epithet of a deity to whom children were  offered as sacrifices. \\"Eloi\\" comes from the Hebrew for \\"my God\\" and is  associated with an important phrase in the Bible (a rendering of the first  verse of Psalm 22 is \\"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani\\" [\\"My God, my God, why  hast thou forsaken me\\"], a phrase heard again in Mark 15:34). Thus, both  terms are appropriate descriptions of the two classes. Are the Eloi  forsaken? Or, will the Traveler return to help them? Although this is  probably the first novel containing a time machine, it is not the first  time traveling novel. Both Twain's &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King  Arthur's Court&quot; (1889) and Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;  (1843) precede it. In de Grainville's &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1805), a  Frenchman views future events through a mirror; he doesn't actually travel  through time. Finally, to the reviewer of Jan. 24, 1999, from New York,  there is a reason why the Traveler remains unnamed! Can you see it?	1999-06-03

He did considerable research in geology and he attempts to make the story as plausible as it can be based on the  knowledge of 19th century science. Even though we now know that the  &quot;journey&quot; can't be made, Verne is still successful in his tale. A  German scientist, the irascible Professor Otto Lidenbrock, and his nephew  Axel, uncover an ancient manuscript that reports of an earlier explorer's  journey to the center of the Earth. The two travel to Iceland and, with the  aid of the quiet and resourceful Hans, they enter an extinct volcano.

This first book takes  place in the log cabin and farm in the woods a few miles from the small  town of Pepin, Wisconsin, in 1871-1872. Through the eyes of a little girl,  a real glimpse of frontier life is provided (we later discover that each  book becomes more organized and developed, as if mirroring the growth of  Laura Ingalls). The book is filled with descriptions of how settlers had to  provide for themselves and how they still had time to sing and enjoy their  lives. The Wilder series also points out how much women contributed in the  frontier. These stories point out the frontier and restless spirit and  character of a typical fronteir pioneer as well as the work ethic and  patience of men and women who have to get all they need from nature. The  series is considered one of the classics in children's literature. Every  serious student of children literature should have a copy on their shelves.  In addition, as mentioned above, the text is a great sourcebook for 19th  century food, traditions, games, and songs that were common in a frontier  home.	1999-06-02

In addition, although it  is never mentioned in the books, Laura had a little baby brother at this  time (Charles Frederic, \\"Freddy\\") who died before his first birthday  (1875-1876). And, a new baby sister has been added to the family, Grace  Pearl Ingalls (1877-1941). Laura's father gets a job acting as a  storekeeper for the Chicago and North Western Railroad who are laying  tracks through the Dakota terretory. While working for them, he finds a new  homestead on the prairie and brings the rest of his family out. There is  concern as to whether he will be able to file his claim on time; but, he  does. The Ingalls family are among the first to live near the new town of  De Smet, South Dakota (although South Dakota doesn't become a state until  1889). The time frame of this book is 1879-1880 and Laura Elizabeth Ingalls  is 12-13 years old. The book was a 1940 Newbery Honor Book (that is, a  runner-up to the Medal winner) for best contribution to American children's  literature. And, it deserved it! Near the end of the book, Laura gets her  first glimpse at the boy who will later become her husband, Almanzo Wilder.	1999-06-02

This is the second book published in Laura Ingalls Wilder's (1867-1957) well-read series for children. However, it isn't concerned with the Ingalls family but rather the family of her future husband, Almanzo James Wilder  (1857-1949). The story takes place near the town of Malone in upper New  York near the Canadian border on the prosperous farm of the Wilder family  and depicts the life of a nine/ten-year-old boy about 1866/1867. Besides  Almanzo, the main characters are Almanzo's parents, James Mason Wilder  (1813-1899) and Angelina Wilder (1821-1905), his brother Royal Gould Wilder  (1847-1925), and his two sisters, Eliza Jane (1850-1930) and Alice  (1853-1892). In this book, Almanzo realizes that what he wants to be is a  farmer. That is what he enjoys and what he excells in. (I really can't  understand the comments of the Feb. 14, 1999, reviewer from Toledo, Spain.  What was the &quot;misinterpretation of human nature&quot;? This book for  children is an account of what happened to the main character as related to  the author by her husband!)	1999-06-02

This book, written and illustrated by David Wisniewski (for some reason, amazon.com neglected to list him as the author), is the winner of the 1997 Caldecott Medal for best illustrations in a book for children. It is a  retelling of a legend about Rabbi Loew in an Eastern European city in 1580  who brings to life a &quot;golem&quot; who protects the Jews at that time.  It is a stark and important tale that demonstrates the problems the Jewish  people have had through the ages. Thus, the book can lead to some important  discussions. However, it is not a book for younger children. It is probably  best for children of age eleven or older. According to the author, this  legend was a possible source for Shelley's monster.	1999-06-02

This short book by Sperry (1897-1976) won the 1941 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. Mafatu, a Polynesian boy of 15 years old, has an intense fear of the ocean. At the age of three he was  nearly killed when his mother drowned. Now he must conquer his fears. He  goes off on his own and finds the courage within him. The story (probably  for ages 9 to 13) starts off on the island of Hikueru in the Tuamotu  Archipelago east of Tahiti at a time before European ships and missionaries  had arrived. Apparently, Sperry, who had traveled throughout the South  Pacific, based his story on an old and true Polynesian tale.	1999-06-02

This short book for preschoolers depicts three babys who are playing with, respectively, a father, a grandmother, and a mother. It is simply a story of the love of children. Interestingly, the second child is  African-American but the grandmother appears not to be so. This is the  first Caldecott book I've seen suggesting the existence of interracial  families. If I'm correct, I readily applaud the author. But, even if I'm  wrong, it is still a beautiful book of love.

In this next book in the extended autobiography of Laura Ingalls Wilder (she is 13/14 years old in this story), it is late 1880 and there are indications that a long and hard winter will hit De Smet, South Dakota.  Charles Ingalls decides to move his family into the small town for the  winter. The first blizzard hits October 1 and the winter will last until  April, 1881. The family soon finds itself trapped in the small cabin.  Because no trains can come through, the town is running out of food and  fuel. By the end of the book, young Cap Garland and Almanzo Wilder, Laura's  future husband, go in search of some rumored wheat many miles away to try  and save the town's inhabitants. The book shows the courage and  resourcefulness of pioneers. The Ingalls family (and the other residents of  De Smet) had to survive six-to-seven months of total isolation. One wonders  if many families of today would be able to do that. The book was a 1941  Newbery Honor Book (that is, a runnerup to the Medal winner) for best  contribution to American children's literature. And, to the young March 19,  1998, reviewer from Pennsylvania, it's been a long, long time since I was  nine years old and I liked the book!	1999-06-02

Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff (most texts and dictionaries list his last name as van't Hoff, not Hoff) was a major figure in the development of twentieth century chemistry. Not only did he contribute to our  understanding of the tetrahedral carbon and issues of stereochemistry, his  contributions in chemical kinetics were major. It was he that showed that  in equilibrium systems, the reaction rate in the forward direction is equal  to the rate in the reverse direction. The van't Hoff plot, plotting the  natural log of the equilibrium constant as a function of the reciprocal of  the absolute temperature, allows us the ability to determine the standard  change in enthalpy and standard change in entropy. For this, and other  discoveries, J. H. van't Hoff (1852-1911) was awarded the first (1901)  Nobel Prize in Chemistry. On October 11, 1879, van't Hoff gave a lecture in  Amsterdam on &quot;Imagination in Science.&quot; This lecture was  reprinted, with notes by Dr. Georg F. Springer in 1967, by the publisher  Springer-Verlag. In this lecture, van't Hoff points out the importance of  imagination in science, particularly in 1) the choice of the moment or the  object of observation, 2) the discretionary alteration of the observed, 3)  the finding of aids which facilitate observation, 4) the observation of a  correspondence or a dissimilarity, and 5) the setting up of an hypothesis.  He also points out that many famous scientists have exhibited imagination  and interests in the arts and in literature. Many have active minds in many  areas. Interestingly, van't Hoff had been severely criticized the year  before by a noted German organic chemist, Hermann Kolbe, for van't Hoff's  theory of the tetrahedral carbon atom. As we know now, van't Hoff and Le  Bel were quite correct and their ideas on chemical structure greatly  advanced the field of chemistry. The puplisher should be applauded for  making available this lecture to the public.	1999-06-01

A children's book based on a book of poems by Sherley Anne Williams that first appeared in the mid-1970s. It is about a migrant family (in this case, an African-American family) who are bused from one cotton field to  another to pick cotton in which the children have to help. The book is  really an indictment against child labor. It shows the hardships of this  life, how important the \\"family\\" is, how tired and exhausted everyone  (especially children) are at the end of the day, and how much children miss  playing with other children. Reading the book with other children should  lead to some fruitful discussions. It is beautifully written and  illustrated.

The little angel, who is acting  like all little boys, has to come up with a present for the newly born baby  Jesus. It is a beautiful Christmas story and every mischievous boy can  relate to this littlest angel. I really find it hard to understand to  understand the comments of the 1998 reviewer from Oroville.

I take a slightly different  stance. Any book or series of books that can get children into the habit of  reading (period!) in today's world of TV and video games are great! More  power to them.

When I first read this book I laughed and laughed (I'm over 50); but, I said to myself that little children (certainly in the age group  given by the publisher and the professional reviewers) would miss most of  the humor. And preschoolers would be even less able to see the humor. Thus,  I began to agree with the other customer reviewers who only gave the book  one or two stars. But, notice that I gave the book five stars. Look at the  other comments. And look at the responses you see from children that you  may come in contact with. Children really enjoy the lampooning of tales  they have heard thousands of time. Let us not forget that children tend to  be smarter than we may think! Lampooning has always been popular (I really  don't understand the comments made by an earlier adult reviewer who thought  the book was simply stupid). One of the most hilarious tales of ancient  Greece was a lampoon of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;  by Pigres entitled &quot;The Battle of the Frogs and Mice&quot; (also known  as &quot;Batrachomyomachia&quot;). The humor of lampoons seem to be  &quot;over-the-head&quot; of some adults but not over-the-head of most  children!

If that is the case, why not use the  story to teach about rule breaking? I think it is very interesting to learn  that the Reys had arrived in New York in 1940, having fled from the Germans  invading France. In a way, they were just like George, forced to come to a  new world and a new culture. I'll bet they got into trouble every now and  then just because of their innocence and their curiosity.	1999-05-30

This children's book, illustrated by Mary Azarian, won the 1999 Caldecott Medal for best illustrations in a book for children. It is the story of Wilson A. Bentley (1865-1931) of Jericho, Vermont, who had a passion for  studying snowflakes. Having developed a technique for photographing  snowflakes, he spent years collecting and giving lectures in the midst of  running his farm: a true farmer-scientist. He even wrote a text called Snow  Crystals. He noted the six sidedness of most crystals and a few  three-sided. One wonders what he would have said upon hearing that some  researchers in the late 1990s had found two identical snowflakes since he  had never been able to find two that were alike. This book is a celebration  not only of the man but of our love and interest in the natural world.  Children will enjoy this book with its magnificent woodcuts immensely.	1999-05-29

This novel won the 1961 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. It is based on a true event of a young Indian girl (and her six-year-old brother who dies shortly after the initial events in  the story) who was accidentally marooned on the island of San Nicolas off  the coast of southern California in 1835. She was alone on that island for  eighteen years and is now buried in Santa Barbara, California. The book, a  true story of survival, is written primarily for children of the ages nine  to fourteen. And, it has to be one of the most popular and familiar books  for children in the second half of the twentieth century. Perhaps it is  because it is a true story of a teenager able to survive by herself for so  long, using her wits and her courage.	1999-05-29

This speculative novel won the 1994 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. Apparently, it is one of the most popular books for children (approximately ages ten to thirteen) in the late 1990s.  It is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in an unusual future world  and is about to turn twelve. In this world, everyone lives in a highly  structured Community and each is assigned specific roles. There is no war,  no pain, and when one is old and is no longer contributing to the  community, they happily are \\"released,\\" although no one seems to know what  that really means. When a young person turns twelve (all turn ages on the  same date each year; just like horses do today), there is a big ceremony in  which each is assigned their future job at which they become apprenticed.  However, Jonas is not assigned to a job. Due to his special insights,  compassion, and intelligence, he has been selected to be the new Receiver  of Memories. This Receiver is a single individual who has within themselves  all of the memories of the past, including memories of true pain, war,  passion, family, etc. The older Receiver becomes the Giver and begins to  transfer these memories to Jonas. Soon Jonas discovers concepts he never  even considered. For example, he discovers color and that the ability to  perceive color had been purposedly removed in the distant past. He  discovers hills, snow, joy, and pain. And he learns about love. Finally, he  discovers what \\"release\\" really means. And, he and the Giver must do  something about it. Near the end of the novel, Jonas starts a quest to find  others with imagination, memories, and passions; others with more humanity.	1999-05-28

Teachers may consider recalling for their classes  that Spenser's tale is allegorical in nature in which George represented  the Church, Una represented Truth, and the dragon represented Error. This  can lead to discussions of other works of literature.

Magnusson and Palsson translated and wrote short commentaries on the two famous Icelandic sagas describing the discovery of both Greenland and North America (Vinland): &quot;Graenlendinga Saga&quot; (written about 1190) and  &quot;Eirik's Saga&quot; (written about 1260). Both sagas begin when Eirik  and his father Thorvald emigrate to Iceland (c. 960) due to some killings  in Norway. Eirik the Red explores and colonizes Greenland about 985 or 986.  At the same time, Bjarni Herjolfsson sights North America; however, he  doesn't land. North America is explored by Leif Eiriksson about 1001. The  sagas give the first descriptions of North America as well as the natives.  Thorfinn Karlsefni and his wife Gudrid settle in Vinland about 1010. Their  son Snorri Karlsefnisson is soon born in Vinland (Hence, Virginia Dare was  not the first European born in North America!). The natives become too  violent and the Norse return to Iceland.

This epic were required reading in the humanities course I took at U.C.L.A. in the mid-1960s. And, I've reread it a number of times since then. The prose translation I read was by Rieu (if you are interested in  the verse translation, see the volume provided by Robert Fagles). &quot;The  Odyssey&quot; is the epic poem of the wanderings of Odysseus trying to  return to his home in Ithaca following the end of the siege of Troy. There  are three basic threads in this epic: Telemachus' search for his father,  Odysseus (Books II-IV); the wanderings of Odysseus (Books I and V-XIII);  and, Penelope's struggles with her suitors (Books XIV-XXIV). All of these  come together in the conclusion. &quot;The Odyssey&quot; begins in the  middle of the tale (in medias res) when Odysseus request to leave Calypso  on the island of Ogygia. Much of his wanderings are told as recaptulations  of earlier events. Telemachus sets out from Ithaca to find his father; but  he searches in vain at Pylos and Sparta. Odysseus has many adventures in  his travels: battle with the warlike Cicones; an encounter with the  Lotus-Eaters; the famous fight with the cyclops Polyphemus; a near  shipwreak following the release of winds from a bag; a visit with the  enchantress Circe who turns Odysseus' men into swine; talks with the  spirits of the dead; escape from the Sirens; eluding Scylla and Charybdis,  two sea-monsters lying between Italy and Sicily; the killing of the sacred  oxen of the Sun; seven years with Calypso; another shipwreak; rescue by  King Alcinous; and the final arrival on Ithaca. This is one of the great  classics of literature and evry college student should be required to read  it. I've always felt that until recently when I discovered that, at a local  Middle School, it was required reading for eighth graders! Now, I think  that all High School graduates should have read it.	1999-05-24

This biography won the  1934 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature.  The young reviewer below from Pickering, Canada, complained about how the  book drags on. Well, it is a little slow. What is more intriguing is the  report that this book was required reading for our young reviewer in her  11th grade English class!!! The teacher of that class should be  horsewhipped. This book is for young students, at most ages 12 or 13 (thus,  grades 6 or 7).

It is regarded by many as being a landmark in the development of historical fiction for children and should be on the  shelf of any serious student of children's literature. The story centers  around a couple of years in the life of a young silversmith apprentice,  Johnny Tremain (or, Jonathan Lyte Tremain) in Boston near the start of the  American Revolution. At the beginning of the novel, it is 1773 and a  fourteen-year-old Johnny, who is very good in his work but is also  excessively proud and arrogant, has an accident when working on the Sabbath  when a crucible of molten silver breaks. His right hand is severely burned  and he feels he can no longer become a silversmith. He begins to roam  throughout Boston with despair and finally obtains a job at one of the  Boston newspapers. There he comes in contact with some of the early heroes  of the revolution: John Hancock, Sam and John Adams, Paul Revere, Dr.  Warren, etc. Johnny, and the reader, see the events leading up to the  Boston Tea Party in December 1773 and the very start of the Revolutionary  War at the Battle of Lexington and Concord in April of 1775. I read this  book a second time when I was in my 50s and it is still great to read. And,  reading the comments of the other reviewers, it is apparent that most of  today's young adults like it as much as I did in the late 1950s. And, it is  so much better than the Disney film.	1999-05-23

There is a real joy in science and the author illustrates that joy in the activities of Archibald. Archibald's mother is concerned that her son is so wrapped up in his  reading and his way of looking at things, she sends him to camp to try to  be a \\"normal kid.\\" She wanted him to have a good time. But, Archibald shows  his Mom and the other campers that science and \\"having a good time\\" can go  together. This is a book that celebrates the joy of science and is  something of a rarity in books for children of this age group. I highly  recommend it and think that the comments made by the &quot;Horn Book&quot;  above are a little too harsh. A few lines of the text may have some forced  rhyming. But, that doesn't lessen the value of this book. The Horn  reviewers probably didn't do well in their science courses in College but  did well in poetry.	1999-05-23

The version of the &quot;Iliad&quot; that I read was the prose translation by W. H. D. Rouse (those of you interested in the verse translation should see the edition provided by Robert Fagles). Agamemnon holds a Trojan  captive as his concubine, Chryseis. He refuses to release the girl to her  father Chryses, a priest of Apollo, for ransom. Apollo sends a plague as  punishment and Agamemnon finally relents. But, he replaces her with  Briseis, the concubine of Achilles, the leading Greek warrior. Achilles now  refuses to fight. His closest friend, Patroclus, dons Achilles' armor and  goes to battle, hoping to rally the Greeks against the Trojans. He is  killed in combat by Hector, son of the ruler of Troy. Achilles is furious.  He obtains new armor, is reconciled to Agamemnon, and goes to meet Hector  in battle. Hector is killed and the epic ends with Hector's funeral. This  is one of the great classics of literature and should be required reading  for every College student. Unfortunately, it isn't.	1999-05-23

It's an unusual book in that, if a child has the reading skills  to be able to read it, the child would probably be bored. It is probably a  book to be read in installments by a parent for a young, pre-literate child  about to go to bed. In addition, some readers may take offense at the  characterization of one of the minor characters who is African-American.  The story concerns a family of dolls, who occupy a doll house and become  \\"animated\\" only in the absence of humans. They, and the dollhouse, find  themselves marooned on an island.

The book is filled with  the fables of the old Navajos and descriptions of some of their ceremonies.  I agree with the 1998 reviewer from Washington, D.C., that the comments  made by the Horn Book seem a little too harsh. Apparently, there was a  great interest in Navajo culture at this time in the U.S. The 1930 winner  of the Pulitzer Prize in fiction was &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; by Oliver La  Farge.

She agrees to be \\"bound\\" to a family who are moving to  begin a farm on an isolated section of the coast of colonial Maine.

This nineteenth-century German science fiction novel (&quot;The Two Planets&quot; or &quot;Auf zwei Planeten&quot;) by Kurd Lasswitz (1848-1910), a mathematician, philosopher, and scholar of Kant, was not  translated into English until 1971 (by Hans H. Rudnick). Thus, it had very  little influence in the development of English or American science fiction.  Nevertheless, the novel did have a significant impact. It was a popular  book of young German boys, particularly Wernher von Braun and Willy Ley.  Thus, the novel had an influence in the development of our space age. It  \\"fired\\" their imaginations and had a big effect on German astronautics. The  \\"two planets\\" are Earth and Mars. Three German and Austrian explorers are  traveling in a balloon in an attempt to reach the North Pole. They find  that a group of intelligent beings, very similar to humans, have set up a  base at the Pole. Their balloon is inadvertantly drawn in by the Martian's  antigravity device and two of the explorers find themselves guests of the  Martians. The Martians have come to Earth to educate mankind, to assist in  the development of a utopian Earth,  and to ask for air and solar energy in  return. However, through a misunderstanding, a \\"war\\" arises between the  Martians and England, resulting in the formation of a Martian Protectorate  over Europe. Unfortunately, a number of Martians soon exhibit the  corrupting influences of power, and the Martian rule becomes despotic. An  underground movement develops, keeping the positive aspects of Martian (and  Kantian) philosophy, to rid Earth of the Martian yoke. This is accomplished  with the help of American engineers, who are able to build their own  spaceships to challange the Martians. The \\"good\\" of both planets win and a  new era begins in Earth and Martian relations. And, in all of this,  Lasswitz has two love stories as subplots, one of which is between one of  the explorers and a Martian. When Martian probes began to map the surface  of Mars, one of the newly discovered Martian craters was named after  Lasswitz. This is a classic volume in science fiction and serious students  of science fiction literature should read it.	1999-05-21

Reading it, I find it remarkable that Zamiatin was not sent to  Siberia or executed in one of the many purges occurring in the Soviet Union  at that time. Apparently, the book was never published in the Soviet Union.  It appeared first in English in 1924 (and obviously had a major influence  in the development of Orwell's &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;) and then  in Czech in 1927. The Soviet authorities began to put pressure on the  author through the Writers' Union and, probably due to the help of Maxim  Gorky, Zamiatin was allowed to leave for Paris in 1931 (he died in Paris in  1937). The story is an extrapolation of a totalitarian world. The  population of Earth that have survived a 200-years war find themselves  members of a single state (the One State) where imagination is considered a  disease. In this society the individual does not count, only the multitude.  The central character is D-503 (all the inhabitants are numbers in this  State), a mathematician who is building a space ship to bring their  \\"perfect\\" world and culture to others. The whole novel consists of D-503's  journal. However, D-503 soon meets I-330, a woman who shows him that there  are numbers in the One State that feel that the State is in error and are  striving for a new revolution. He begins to have strong feelings for her.  He thinks he is ill but he can't help himself. And, he must keep his  feelings hidden from the Guardians, the One State's \\"protectors.\\" What a  terrific &quot;read.&quot; I highly recommend it (as well as  &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;). As can be seen in the  comments by the other reviewers, &quot;We&quot; is a great book to discuss:  with respect to politics, history, science fiction, or literature.	1999-05-21

Back in 1241, a young trumpeter who held this same position  felt it was his duty to continue sounding his trumpet at the appointed  times even as the city was being overrun by Tartars. In the middle of the  tune, he was killed by an arrow. Ever since then, all of the succeeding  trumpeters stop playng the tune at that same point in memory and honor of  that earlier trumpeter.

The people  still living in England have no record of what happened, the event  occurring centuries earlier. Most of the central part of the British Isle  is now covered by a giant lake. A poisonous swamp covers the site of old  London. Much of the novel is a description of this future England. The  people live in a feudal-like environment and the hero of the story, Felix,  sets out on a quest in a canoe to find fame and fortune so that he may win  the hand of the daughter of a neighboring baron. This is probably one of  the earliest novels (if not the earliest) depicting a future Earth  following some cataclysmic event.

A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as  528). The Boss, as he is later known, saves himself from being executed by  predicting a solar eclipse. He is made Arthur's minister and becomes an  enemy of Merlin. He uses his knowledge of nineteenth-century technology to  try and make life better in 6th-century England. But, when he attempts to  improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he  finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a  great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and  of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also  the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant  time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main  character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had  actually lived.)

Swift's classic satire of English and European governments, societies, and cultures should be required reading of every college student. (Except for those who appear to be in law school as is the earlier reviewer who  referred to Swift as being an &quot;18th century Unabomber.&quot; Swift may  have been conservative in his beliefs and not cared much for individuals  such as Robert Boyle, who is satirized in the book, but he was not violent.  Perhaps our &quot;law student/reviewer&quot; is offended by Swift's biting  satire of lawyers and politicians in part four.) The version I read was an  annotated edition by Isaac Asimov and contained many passages that had been  deleted by previous publishers. Asimov's comments enable the reader to more  fully appreciate Swift's satire. In part one of the novel, a ship's  surgeon, Lemuel Gulliver, is shipwreaked and finds himself on the island of  Lilliput, the inhabitants all being only six inches high. This section is  great satire of English politics and wars. Royal ponp, feuds amongst the  populace, and wars are made to look rediculous. In the second part,  Gulliver finds himself in Brobdingnag in which he is only six  &quot;inches&quot; tall (relatively speaking). This part forms another  satire of European governments. In part three, Gulliver visits the flying  island of Laputa where shades of ancient scholars can be called up. This  section is a satire on philosophers and scientists. Scientists are  portrayed as men so wrapped up intheir speculations as to be totally  useless in practical affairs. Absurd experiments are described (for  example, extracting sunlight from cucumbers (but, extracting energy from  cucumbers and other plants is no longer so absurd Jonathan)). Also  described in this third part are the Struldbergs, men and women who are  immortal but who turn out to be miserable and pitiable. In part four,  Gulliver travels to the Land of the Houyhnhnms, horses with intelligence  but who have no passion or emotion. The word &quot;Yahoo&quot; originates  in this part. READ IT!	1999-05-20

Several individuals have also pointed out that not only is this an early  time-traveling story (perhaps the earliest), it is also probably the  earliest story about alternative futures, later popular among science  fiction writers as well as historians.	1999-05-20

Mary Shelley's classic book has often been regarded as the first science fiction novel. Brian Aldiss has referred to it as the first novel of the Scientific Revolution. It should be required reading of any college or  college-bound student. The version I read was the original 1818 edition. In  1831, Mary Shelley made a number of changes (but, nothing of great import;  for example, in the 1831 version Elizabeth is no longer Victor's cousin). I  did read the author's new introduction to the 1831 edition however. This  introduction is well done. In this novel, written in the epistolary form, a  young (age 21) student at the University of Ingolstadt, Victor  Frankenstein, discovers the method of imparting life to inanimate tissue.  He uses his skills to construct a creature and to give it life. The  creature's and Victor's lives are intertwined and the reader can detect  much of Mary Shelley's early life as well. Her mother (i.e., her creator)  died a few days after her birth. The female act of creation and its results  is an aspect of this novel. Others have pointed out that this is a true  female novel. Although, the monster &quot;inspires loathing&quot; in all  who see him, I came to the conclusion that the real villian in this story  was Victor Frankenstein. He allows his own creation to control him.	1999-05-19

It deals primarily with two central events in the life  of the Geatish hero Beowulf. The first is concerned with his victory over  the monster Grendel who had been attacking Heorot, the mead hall of the  Danish king Hrothgar (John Gardner published a novel, &quot;Grendel&quot;,  in 1971, that takes Grendel's side in the story). The next day, Beowulf  slays Grendel's mother who is attempting to try and avenge her son. In the  second major event, taking place fifty years later, Beowulf fights a  dragon; both are mortally wounded. Hygelac, King of the Gelts, is  identified with the historical Chochilaicus, who raided the lower Rhine  about 512 A. D. A young Beowulf was in that raid. When Chochilaicus was  killed in a battle with the Franks about 520, he was succeeded by his son  Heardred. This poem shows the importance, in a warrior society, of the  relationship between the warrior and his lord. The poem, even though it  contains threads of Christian commentary, is also concerned with the pagen  view of immortality: the memory of a warrior's heroic acts. Also: that fate  can be swayed by courage. &quot;Fate often saves an undoomed man when his  courage is good.&quot;	1999-05-18

It was also made into a film with Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis. A cocktail party given by an unsuccessful history professor (George) and his  wife (Martha) for a new instructor (Nick) with his wife (Honey) turns into  a long session of arguments, verbal abuse, revelations, and catharsis.  There are several references to George and Martha's 21-year-old son who we  later discover to be nonexistent. The younger couple, who are having a  child, turn out to have a sterile marriage as well, albeit for different  reasons. This play won the 1962-1963 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award.  This play is filled with great dialogue: witticisms, verbal abuse, sorrow,  and even compassion. It is easily one of the top dramas of the twentieth  century.	1999-05-18

In 1922, it won the very first Newbery Medal for best  contribution to American children's literature (the Melcher family had just  established the John Newbery Medal). It concentrates mostly on European  history since van Loon, in the early 1920s, is attempting to explain those  factors that were present in the world at that time. His son William has  written several new chapters which expand this view (his father had passed  away in 1944). And, I have seen editions that are furthur updated. But, the  elder van Loon simply had a style of writing history that seems attractive  to children. I saw a previous edition of this book by van Loon when I was a  kid and always wanted to read it.

This is a collection of nine classic short stories about robots, each of which appeared previously in a pulp SF magazine. The stories contain Asimov's famous three &quot;laws&quot; of robotics as well as the  positronic brain (consisting of a platinum/iridium sponge), now quite  familiar with &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. All of these have been great  influences in both science and science fiction: 1) A robot may not injure a  human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2) A  robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such  orders would conflict with the First Law; and 3) A robot must protect its  own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First  and Second Laws. It should also be noted that Asimov coined the word  \\"robotics\\" in these stories, a term very common today. I really enjoyed  these when I first read them as a teenager (my father had introduced me to  Asimov's works). And, now rereading them many years later, I can understand  why I enjoyed them. They are straight-forward science fiction in which a  problem is presented and a solution posed. The first story, \\"Robbie,\\" first  appeared in 1940 (when Asimov 20 years old) in a slightly different form as  \\"Strange Playfellow.\\" Robbie is a companion robot for a child and the  child's mother is apprehensive in allowing her daughter to play with it.  \\"Runaround\\" (1942) is a story concerning a problem encountered by two  trouble-shooters on a mining operation on the surface of Mercury. A robot  has been given orders to retrieve some ore yet keeps walking in circles, to  the detriment of the two human workers. They come to the conclusion that  the problem lies with the three Laws and they have to find a solution.  (This type of story [that is, of a problem presented needing a solution]  becomes a common format for Asimov's science fiction and mystery stories.)  In \\"Reason\\" (1941) the two trouble-shooters of the previous story are still  on Mercury and have to reason with a robot who has been designed to take  over the mining operation and energy conversion plant on Mercury. The robot  has come to a conclusion that humans did not construct him and that his  role is to serve the \\"Master\\" (the conversion apparatus). In \\"Catch That  Rabbit\\" (1944), the two trouble shooters are on an asteroid attempting to  train a robot that has control over six subsidiary robots. For some unknown  reason, the robot ceases to function properly if no human is watching.  \\"Liar!\\" (1941) is a story about a robot, still subject to the Three Laws,  that can read minds. In \\"Little Lost Robot\\" (1947) a robot, which has had  its first law modified, has hidden itself among sixty-two other robots and  it has to be found. In \\"Escape!\\" (1945), a robot has to design an  interstellar ship that may be hazardous to humans; yet, design it without  violating the first law. \\"Evidence\\" (1946) is a story concerned with the  problem of identifying a possible humaniform robot hiding itself among  humans. The final short story, \\"The Evitable Conflict\\" (1950), takes place  several years after the others on an Earth where much of human economics is  directed through massive robot machines. There have been apparent stoppages  and unexpected delays and the human overseers have to find out why. This  story actually introduces the \\"Zeroeth Law\\" of Robotics: \\"No machine may  harm humanity; or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.\\"	1999-05-18

Rhodes was a writer living and writing out of New Mexico who was a very colorful person, often getting in trouble with  the law (including with Sheriff Pat Garrett). This particular novel is  regarded by many as one of the best westerns ever. In 1977 it was voted by  the Western Writers of America one of the top twenty-five westerns of all  time. Rhodes' novels are highly regarded in that they are felt to  accurately depict life in the West. Apparently, Rhodes was an opponent of  Sheriff Pat Garrett in his younger days yet grew incensed in his later  years at how Garrett was mistreated in books and film. In this novel, he  presents Garrett as a man he knew, as a thoughtful and generous  professional. The novel starts out with a humorous bank robbery in Bolan,  New Mexico, by red-headed Ross McEwen. McEwen rides south, evading all of  the posses sent after him. Finally, in order to throw them off his trail  near the White Sands desert, he releases his horse and starts riding a  steer. He comes across a cabin containing a Mexican family (a mother, two  sons, and a grandfather), all of whom have contracted diphtheria. Without  hesitating, he starts to help them. One of the things remarkable about this  book is how an author, born in 1869, and living among &quot;gringos&quot;  in New Mexico is able to write a novel in the 1920s treating Caucasians and  Hispanics so equally. There is no bigotry here. Perhaps, bigotry between  &quot;gringos&quot; and Mexicans was not as prevalent in the Southwest as  the more recent films and novels would have us believe. At least, not among  Westerners. Notice that the &quot;hero&quot; of the book doesn't even  hesitate to think about helping the family. He does it even though it may  lead to his capture. Perhaps this is another typically Western response.  The book was made into a poorly-received film released in the late 1940s  entitled &quot;Four Faces West&quot; starring Joel McCrea and Charles  Bickford.	1999-05-18

The author of this work was a renegade priest who became very depressed about man's overuse of his natural resources. Soon after writing this book he (1746-1805) committed suicide. From a historical perspective, this may  be the first book written about a distant future. In this book, for some  unexplained reason, man in the distant future can no longer propagate and  he is heading for extinction. A nineteenth-century Frenchman has entered a  cave in Syria where, through mirrors, can see the future. God sends the  first man, Adam, on a mission to the last man, Omegarus (and his wife  Syderia). Omegarus proceeds to tell Adam his story. Thus, Omegarus is  telling a story to Adam, and this narrative is being watched through  mirrors by the Frenchman in Syria. Some have suggested that this is the  first time-traveling novel; but, this would be a mistake since no traveling  occurs. The Frenchman stays in the 19th century. But, the book does show  that there was concern about the environment and the waste of resources  early in the 19th century.	1999-05-18

Vellacott has provided excellent translations and commentaries on four of the plays of Euripedes, including his classic &quot;Medea.&quot; They should be required reading of any college student. &quot;Medea&quot; is a  study in how unbridled passion can overcome reason and lead to tragedy.  This may be particularly pertinent with respect to the ongoing war between  Athens and Sparta at the time the play was first presented. Medea, who had  helped Jason in his quest, become his wife, and given him two sons, feels  betrayed since he is marrying the daughter of the ruler of Corinth. With  horrible vengence, she kills the bride and the king and then her two sons.  &quot;Hecabe&quot; is a play about the wife of Priam, King of Troy, and the  mother of Hector, Paris, Cassandra, and others. At the start of this play,  the war between the Greeks and Troy is over and Hecabe is now a slave of  Agamemnon. The ghost of Achilles had appeared and demanded a sacrifice over  his tomb before the Greeks can set sail for home. They vote to sacrifice  Polyxena, Hecabe's young daughter, despite the tears and entreaties of  Hecabe. After Polyxena's noble death, Hecabe learns that her last child  Polydorus had been murdered by the King of Thrace, Polymestor, to whom  Polydorus had been sent for safekeeping. This finally drives Hecabe mad and  she seeks vengence for Polydorus's death. Euripedes shows in this play the  effects of war and vengence on innocent lives and how cruel men at war can  be. &quot;Electra&quot; is another retelling of the vengence story of  Electra and Orestes. In this version, they are less heroic and more  realistic then the way they are portrayed by Aeschylus and Sophocles.  Interestingly, the one true noble and honest character in the play is the  peasant husband of Electra, who refuses to tough her because he is beneath  her station. Was Euripedes making a social comment about the upper classes  of Athens of his time? The final play is &quot;Heracles.&quot; In this  play, the wife of Heracles, his three young sons, and Heracles' father  Amphitryon are in danger of being killed by the usurping king of Thebes,  Lycus. Lycus wishes them dead since he had killed Megara's father, King  Creon, and taken his throne and Lycus doesn't want the three sons to grow  up to avenge the death of their grandfather. Heracles is believed by many  to be dead. But, he returns in time to thwart and kill Lycus.  Unfortunately, the goddess Hera, who has always had a hatred of Heracles,  sends the minor goddess Madness down to drive Heracles temporarily insane.  In his fits, he kills his wife and sons. When sanity returns to him, he  realizes what he has done and how immoral the gods are. The Greek gods are  not an acceptable standard for moral behavior. Man can serve as a standard,  and this is exemplified in the play by Theseus, ruler of Athens.	1999-05-17

I have later learned that the American publisher made considerable  editorial changes in the original novel; much later, Aldiss republished  this work without those changes. Unfortunately, this is not that newer  version. But, the book is required reading of any serious student of  science fiction literature. The novel takes place on an Earth in the  extremely distant future. This Earth has ceased to rotate about its axis;  thus, one side faces the sun while the other side is constantly in the  dark. Almost all animal life has disappeared, with just a few  representatives left. Plant life has taken over the planet, much of it  feeding on other plants or what remains of animal life. The land on the  sunny side is covered by a giant banyan tree upon which other plants live  and thrive. In this tree also live the remnants of humans, who are now  one-fifth their original size and have no memory of what they once were.  The \\"hero\\" of the story is a young male named Gant who, in his travels, is  infected by a sentient fungus called a morel. This fungus is able to  uncover man's racial memories and, in so doing, helps Gant to learn to  think and analyze for himself. Also included in the story are the  Traversers, enormous gas-bag vegetable spiders that have the ability to  travel through space. They regularly travel between the Earth and the Moon,  which now has a more hospitable environment. However, Aldiss has the moon  in a stationary position about the Earth (an astronomical impossibility  even in the distant future!). Also, if I recall correctly, he places the  Moon in a Trojan orbit. If so, that wouldplace the Moon millions of miles  from Earth. The moon would only be a small dot in the sky (and might not  even be seen from the sunny-side Earth).	1999-05-17

This is an excellent translation of the first play of the Oresteia trilogy (the only extant Greek trilogy). I particularly enjoyed it because of the ongoing commentary and annotations. This trilogy should be required reading  of any college student and it should occur early in their college life.   The trilogy won First Prize at the Greater Dionesia in 458 B. C. Agamemnon  returns to Argos from the Trojan War. He is killed by his wife Clytemnestra  and his first cousin Aegisthus. Clytemnestra's reasons for the murder of  both Agamemnon and Cassandra were questioned even in ancient Greece: was it  for revenge for the death of her daughter Iphigenia or was it for her  adultery with Aegisthus? In one of Pindar's odes (c. 474 B. C.),  &quot;Pythia 11&quot;, Pindar asks: &quot;Was it Iphigeneia, who at the  Euripos crossing was slaughtered far from home, that vexed her to drive in  anger the hand of violence? Or was it couching in a wrong bed by night that  broke her will and set her awry?&quot; The Oresteia trilogy is a study in  justice. Agamemnon's death must be avenged; but, this means matricide.  Orestes, in the next play, should not have been the hand of vengence.	1999-05-16

Way back in 1970, Sir Lloyd-Jones had come out with the three plays in individual format and filled with annotations. Now, all three plays are together. And all three  plays should be required reading for new students at a university. The  first play in the Oresteia trilogy (the only extant Greek trilogy) is  &quot;Agamemnon.&quot; The trilogy won First Prize at the Greater Dionesia  in 458 B. C. Agamemnon returns to Argos from the Trojan War. He is killed  by his wife Clytemnestra and his first cousin Aegisthus.

Or was it couching in a  wrong bed by night that broke her will and set her awry?&quot; The Oresteia  trilogy is a study in justice. Agamemnon's death must be avenged; but, this  means matricide. Orestes, in the next play, should not have been the hand  of vengence. The second play is &quot;The Libation Bearers.&quot; It is the  earliest known play containing an intrigue as the main plot. Electra,  sister of Orestes, has been sent to the grave of Agamemnon to offer a  libation. Clytemnestra is attempting to placate the spirit of her dead  husband. When she and Aegisthus are killed by Orestes, Orestes finds that  now the Furies will pursue him rather than his mother. The final play is  &quot;The Eumenides.&quot; The Eumenides are daughters of Night who avenge  crimes committed by offspring against parents and who punished people who  fail to keep their oaths. In this last play, Apollo purifies Orestes by  washing him in pigs' blood. But the Erinyes reject Apollo's order to leave  Orestes alone. The conflict is resolved via a trial overseen by Athena.  This play is the earliest known drama containing a complete change of  scene.	1999-05-16

Vellacott has supplied us with excellent translations with commentaries on the four non-Oresteian plays. The seven plays of Aeschylus should be read by every college-level student, irrespective of their major (I'm in the  sciences and I have enjoyed them). The popular &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;  is concerned with the conflict between force and injustice on one side and  intelligence, justice, and altruism on the other. The Titan Prometheus, who  has stolen fire from heaven and given it to Earth's mortal inhabitants, is  being punished for his presumption by being bound to a rock on Mount  Caucasus and tortured. He can foretell the future, but refuses to tell Zeus  the secret of Zeus' downfall. &quot;The Persians&quot; is the least read  play; probably because it has very little action. But, I like it. It is the  oldest surviving play based on an event of recent history. The play was  first produced in 472 B. C., only eight years after the Battle of Salamis.  The speech by the Messenger in the play is the earliest known historical  account of that battle. A disgraced Xerxes follows the Messenger.  Interestingly, this play also contains the earliest known appearance by a  ghost in a drama. &quot;The Suppliants&quot; is the first play of a  trilogy, has very little action, and is merely a prologue to the two  missing members of the trilogy. The fifty daughters of Danaus are fleeing  from the fifty sons of Aegyptus, their cousins. The daughters seek  sanctuary from Pelasgus, King of Argos. The play, and probably the trilogy,  focuses on when city-states should give sanctuary to others. &quot;Seven  Against Thebes&quot; is a retelling of the war between the sons of Oedipus,  Eteocles and Polyneices. They were to supposed to share power in Thebes but  have quarrelled. Eteocles seizes power and Polyneices goes to get help from  Adrastus, King of Argos, and six other kings. Eteocles sends champions to  fight the six kings at six of the gates of Thebes. The seventh gate isleft  to Eteocles. However, that is the gate to which his brother comes. Eteocles  feels that he has no choice but to fight and further incur the wrath of the  gods by shedding kindred blood. Eteocles had an &quot;out&quot; of his  predicament but he choses not to use it. &quot;When the gods send  destruction there is no escape.&quot;	1999-05-15

This children's book is a retelling of an old Russian tale by Arthur Ransome, who had first published the story way back in 1916. It is about an honest and innocent young boy who tries to find a flying ship and, in so  doing, encounters several men with unique abilities. At the end of the  story, the boy wins the hand of the Czar's daughter and the boy is no  longer regarded as a fool. I am certain that I shall be in the minority in  my opinion because I see a slightly darker side to the old folktale. I  think that the young lad is more foolish than the original author intended.  He had discovered flight yet failed to use it to help others or to advance  his kingdom. He found people with magical and unusual powers but fails to  use them to help others or to better the Kingdom after the original  &quot;mission&quot; had been completed.

I disagree with the comments of an earlier reviewer (Ms. Whittaker from Rush City, Minnesota,  in 1998); the artwork is simple and direct because of the nature of the  simple and quiet story and because the book is really aimed a  pre-schoolers. Interestingly, the book won the 1963 Caldecott Medal for  best illustration in a children's book.

This is a children's book based on the legend surrounding Richard Whittington. Whittington, who died in 1423, was mayor of London 1397-1399, 1406-1407, and 1419-1420. He became very prosperous and generous. The  legend says that he was a homeless boy who did odd jobs in a house and kept  a cat to keep the rats away. But, he had to send the cat off on a trading  ship. The cat was sold to a Moorish ruler whose kingdom had been overrun  with rats. The cat becomes a noted ratter and the ruler bestows a great  treasure on Whittington. (However, the historical Whittington appears to  have been the son of a knight of Gloucester). The earliest known appearance  of the legend is in 1605. This book was a 1951 Caldecott Honor book (i.e.,  a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in a book for  children. I've always found it of interest to discover how much children  enjoy stories that are based on real people.	1999-05-13

This children's book is about a boy living on a farm who finds a bear cub and raises him. But, the bear grows to a very large size and becomes somewhat of a pest to the neighbors. What is the boy to do? The book won  the 1953 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a book for children.  <br />The 1998 reviewer from Alaska seems to have comments that are little too  extreme. Hunting was a normal activity for families living on farms near  woods in that time period. And, the boy does find a solution that allows  his pet to survive. In the 1939 Pulitzer Prize winner &quot;The  Yearling&quot; by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, there was a much different  ending for the wild pet! This is a nice book that children will enjoy  despite the concerns of that reviewer. I'm not a hunter and I  wholeheartedly recommend it.	1999-05-13

I first read this children's book when I was much, much younger. And, I still enjoy it. It is about a boy who, if he ran the zoo, would replace all the animals with very unusual species, all of them quite fanciful and  imaginative. This book is another illustration of how much the author loved  children's imagination and how important it is to develop that imagination.

They come  up with oobleck, a green, gooey substance. But, when it begins to fall, it  messes up everything and the king's page, Bartholomew, teaches the king the  power of the words, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; The book was a 1950 Caldecott  Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in  a children's book.	1999-05-12

The noted children's book about a house built on a hill away from any town. As the years pass, the city comes closer and closer and eventually surrounds the little house which misses its old hills and trees. One  earlier reviewer expressed concern about the apparent anti-urban bias. I  think Burton simply had a pro-nature bias rather than anti-urban. And, I  think any of us, including those who live in cities or suburbia would not  care to live in the sprawl that was depicted in the illustrations and was  indeed present in many cities in the 1940s when the book first came out.

I first read it when I was a teenager. This particular story is an interesting look at discrimination.  In this book, a 62-year-old tailor is accidentally transported to a distant  future. In this future, the Galaxy is populated by man and Earth is only a  minor planet within the Galactic Empire. The peoples of other worlds treat  Earthlings as being a separate and defective race. An archeologist travels  to Earth to find evidence that a single planet, Earth, was the source of  mankind. Earth itself has a Procurator representing the Galactic Empire  while the local politics are centered about a strict theocracy (reminiscent  of ancient Rome and Israel) which controls the size of the population by  euthanasia of its citizens at the age of sixty. The population is always  threatening to revolt against the Empire. An Earth neurophysicist has  discovered a new technique with which the rate of learning can be  accelerated. He describes it as a procedure that can alter the dielectric  constant between synapses (unfortunately, a change in the dielectric  constant would probably result in protein denaturation; but that would ruin  the story). Our time-traveling tailor is subjected to this treatment with  unexpected results.	1999-05-09

C. to c. 355 B. C.) was a Greek soldier and historian who was born in Athens and was a student of  Socrates. In 401 B. C., Xenophon joined an army of Greek mercenaries who  were aiding Cyrus the Younger in his military campaign against his brother,  King Artaxerxes II. Unfortunately, Cyrus was killed in the Battle of Cunaxa  in 401 B. C. and the 10000 Greeks find themselves alone in enemy territory,  more than 1000 miles from the nearest Greek colony. In addition, the  leaders of the force were treacherously murdered by the Persian satrap  Tissaphernes. Xenophon is one of the Greek leaders chosen to lead the army  in retreat out of Persia. In a march that lasted five months,  traveled  over 1500 miles, and overcoming many obstacles (both external and  internal), they finally reach the colony of Trapezus (now Trabzon, Turkey)  on the Black Sea. This book, which (in the original Greek) is usually the  first book read by modern students of the ancient Greek language, is  Xenophon's eyewitness account of that retreat and is one of the most famous  books in military history. It should be required reading for everyone.	1999-05-08

This first story by Adams was also made into a short television series. The  stories are centered about an alien named Ford Prefect, who has been  spending some time on Earth serving as a roving researcher for &quot;The  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; and his human friend Arthur Dent, a  common English &quot;everyman&quot; who is constantly searching for a  drinkable cup of tea. At the start of the first novel, Dent wakes up in the  morning to discover that his house is being destroyed to make way for a  bypass. Ford Prefect arrives to tell Dent that Earth itself is about to be  demolished in order to make way for an interstellar bypass by the Vogons.  Just prior to Earth's destruction, the two stow away on a Vogon ship. The  two survivors are thrown out of the ship but soon meet the egocentric  Zaphod Beeblebox, Ford's cousin and President of the Galaxy  (&quot;President in particular is very much a figurehead-he wields no power  whatsoever&quot;), who has a surgically-added extra arm and extra head.  With Zaphod is the girl Trillian (Tricia McMillan) who had been picked up  at a party on Earth by Zaphod. They are traveling in a prototype space  ship, &quot;The Heart of Gold,&quot; stolen by Zaphod. The ship is powered  by an Infinite Improbability Drive, which can be used as a method for  crossing vast interstellar distances in a &quot;mere nothing of a  second&quot; by generating small amounts of finite improbability. The  development of an &quot;infinite improbability generator&quot; was made  possible by calculating exactly how improbable such a generator was and  creating this finite improbability. Another character in these books is  Marvin, a manicly depressed android with a powerful brain. This unusual  group of characters travel to the planet Magrathea which specializes in  custom-made luxury planet building.However, two nuclear missiles are fired  at them. Fortunately, Dent accidentally triggers the infinite improbability  drive which turns the missiles into a bowl of petunias and a sperm whale.  They discover, from the character Slartibartfast, that Earth had actually  been designed by the Magratheans as a gigantic computer whose job it was to  find &quot;The Question.&quot; Another computer, &quot;Deep Thought,&quot;  had earlier calculated the answer to life, the Universe, and everything:  the answer was &quot;42.&quot; But, no one knew the question.  Unfortunately, the Earth had been destroyed five minutes before the  completion of its analysis by the Vogons. This book is thoroughly enjoyable  and I recommend it to everyone.	1999-05-07

This classic short novel is centered about intelligent beings that live in only two dimensions. One of the inhabitants, Mr. Square, describes his world and visits a one-dimensional world. He later encounters beings from  the third dimension. Mr. Square finally considers even higher dimensions.  This tale by Edwin A. Abbott (1839-1926), an English clergyman and  academic, has become quite popular with those physicists and mathematicians  who study higher dimensions. It is also regarded as a classic in the  development of speculative fiction. I really enjoyed reading it. I've had a  copy on my shelf for over forty years and I have never met a Ph.D. in  physics (or math for that matter) who has not read it. Any student of the  development of science fiction should also have a copy.	1999-05-06

However, Helen Fish only  wrote the introduction and selected the passages from the King James  version of the Bible which accompanied these beautiful drawings. The book  was awarded the 1938 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a book for  children, the first Caldecott Medal ever awarded (the Melcher family had  just established the Randolph Caldecott Medal). Any student of children  literature probably should include this book in their collection. However,  modern day children may not be too excited with the pictures. Nevertheless,  the book is great to supplement storytelling from the Bible.	1999-05-06
