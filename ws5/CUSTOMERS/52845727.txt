This is a three-in-one book, publishing Contact And Commune (renamed First Time The Charm), and Converse And Conflict (named Second To One), with the third and, maybe, final book in the series - Third Among Equals.<br /><br />The asteroid, 5023 Eris, has turned out to be a ship - a very, very old space ship full of danger but little in the way of answers for the Elders.  Then there is ANOTHER murder.  Also it turns out that the ship isn't uncrewed.  And, what do you know, the Banker, one of the most powerful men on Earth, may still be alive.<br /><br />Eichra Oren and his friend Sam have their hands (and paws) full.  Enemies are coming from every direction - from within their ranks, from within the asteroid and maybe from beyond the stars!  Toss in the Galactic Confederacy and you have WHOLE other Universe thrown into the mix.<br /><br />It makes you want to toss in your sword, scream Uncle and get drunk.  Great ending, maybe, to the series.<br /><br />I keep saying maybe because you never know with Mr. Smith.	2005-10-09

Did Fox really kill the show or was the mixture of sci-fi and The Old West doomed from the start?  Yes, yes, but the old Star Trek wasn't REALLY a mixture of sci-fi and western.<br /><br />From the Tick, to gender issues, to could the crew of Serenity kick the butts of the crew of the first Enterprise this book is tons of fun.

No hints or tactics for offline play.  Second, it isn't very helpful or detailed for online players either. Example:<br /><br />The chapter on the Kashyyyk Docks explains tactics that either the Clones or the Droids could use.  But nothing about how to play it as the Empire or the Rebels.  As they have different equipment and vehicles the same strategies might not work for them.  Also, some of the strategies are too simple.<br /><br />For example, using the same map as an example, they suggest you take the village command post, City Hall, to cut off the supply of Wookiees then hunt them down.  Well, duh.  If I could get my troops to City Hall I wouldn't need to hunt down the Wookiees because I would have won already!  It's a Catch-22 - to get to City Hall to cut off their reinforcements you have to wipe most of them out to break thru their lines to take City Hall to cut off their spawning point.  What I need is information on how to do that as a offline player!  Online players have dozens of human controlled troops who know what to do.  I don't.  I have dozens of AI controlled troops standing around, running the wrong way and charging into enemy gun fire without dodging!<br /><br />Pretty worthless unless you can get it used and even then reading The Art Of War would get you better ideas.	2005-09-24

Before the Sino-Japanese War China was thought of as the Middle Kingdom.  Even the European powers respected it up to a point.  And before the war Japan...well, Japan wasn't even a blip on the radar.  After the war China was nothing but a corpse to be sliced up and Japan had become THE Asian nation to respect.<br /><br />The book explains, in great detail, how Europe, America and Asia reacted to the war - how it not only changed perceptions but also foreign policy.<br /><br />But did Japan win the war or was it China who lost the war?  Would Japan learn all the WRONG lessons and how would such nations as Russia, Germany, and England respond to a non-European power in the Far East?<br /><br />The book allowed me to understand the history of events that helped bring about the Russo-Japanese War and also made me feel sorry for Korea.	2005-09-24

John Keegan is one of the great historians of the 20th Century, if not of all time.  In this book he explored the major turning points of naval warfare.  The book is divided into four parts.<br /><br />The first part deals with wooden ships, as he tells us of the Battle of Trafalgar, the classic and well known battle between English fleet and the French/Spanish fleet.<br /><br />The second part is about the Battle of Jutland, which from the American point of view is NOT so well known, fought between the British Grand Fleer and the German High Seas Fleet during World War One.  Both fleets were made up of steam powered ironclads.  Frankly, I would think the Battle of Tsushima, during the Russo-Japanese War, to be more interesting and important, but we all have our own opinions.<br /><br />The third part deals with the Battle of Midway and how aircraft carriers changed the way naval battles were being fought. The fact that Japan had more, at the start of the war, than all the rest of her enemies did give her a key advantage at the start.<br /><br />The fourth, and last, part of the book deals with the Battle of the Atlantic and how submarine warfare marked a major changing point in naval operations.<br /><br />In each part Keegan examines the tactics, commanders, equipment, and, as the titles suggests, the price of both victory and defeat.  A must for any military or history library.	2005-09-15

The book is a very detailed history of a important war that few Americans know about.  Sometimes it might pop up in the History books because Teddy Roosevelt helped bring it to a close.  But it is important, because it shows Japan not just as an Asian power, but a WORLD power.  True, the peace that came afterwards was not to its advantage - it didn't get as much as it wanted, it was in debt, and nations that had been friendly to it before the war were now anti-Japanese - but it had proven itself a match for European powers by defeating Russia on all fronts.<br /><br />The book also enlightened on some facts I did not know of.  The Japanese, for example, helped fuel the unrest within Russia, helping bring the revolution closer to reality.  The interaction between the Russian Generals seem to be, to me, almost childish but not as childish as that between the Kaiser and the Tsar.  The Battle of Tsushima, in which ANOTHER Russian Fleet was destroyed by the Japanese, becomes the climax of a war fought with machine guns, spies, mines, thousands of men moved by ships and trains, and,it seems, tons of luck.<br /><br />This is a major turning point in Asian and World history and a great book too.	2005-09-15

ITs not because of people wanting to re-write it as much as teachers REALLY don't have the time and resources to get into the details that's needed to fully understand the issues and events.  Even in collage there's so much a student has to learn that it can't all be covered.  The fact that what we know or think we know changes so swiftly that most textbooks are wrong before the ink even dries.<br /><br />This book really was enjoyable.  I knew some of it, but much of the information was fresh and new to me, having slipped thru the cracks of our educational system, and I have a BA in History!  Which is not worth much when you have to cram so much into four years.  FDR agreeded to send millions of Russians BACK to Stalin?  The Marshall Plan DIDN'T get Europe back on its feet?<br /><br />Of course, one thing this book might do is make people question what they read and, maybe, go do their own research.  There are tons of books out there on Constitutional issues, the Civil War, the Depression, and so on.	2005-09-11

Jungle, in some areas, that was six miles DEEP.  Nobody had EVER seen what lay at the bottom, not even the natives, the taflak, knew what was under the Sea of Leaves.  So when Lysandra and her father, G. Howell Nahuatl (both characters from Tom Paine Maru) are hired to test out a subfoline they don't know what they will find.  A Yeti, a lost civilization and the Hooded Seven.  Oh my.<br /><br />The first few chapters overlap the last few chapters of BrightSuit MacBear.  In fact, both Middle C and Goldberry, characters from BrightSuit MacBear, become major characters in this story.<br /><br />Here is the funny part.  When I first red this story years ago I knew nothing about the Confederacy Series or about L. Neil Smith.  I enjoyed the story, then years later found The Probability Broach and only now have linked the book to the author.  Taflak Lysandra is a adventure story, first and last, set in a different universe.

One that didn't belong to him.<br /><br />Berdan decided to stop his grandfather, but doing so meant leaving the Tom Edison Maru and landing on a planet covered, from pole to pole, with jungle, dangerous animals and exotic cultures.<br /><br />Set after the events in Tom Paine Maru ( which is set in the Confederacy universe) the novel is fast, fun and, like many of the author's books, about people who belive in being themselves - about TRUE freedom.

This novel is a first one for Alexander Besher, one in which he explores a lot of new ideas, using cyber-punk (or cyber-noir or cyber-fantasy), as the delivery system.  Now, I have books that have forced me to look at the universe in different ways.  The Hitchhiker series and the Illuminatus! trilogy (which I think did some brain damage) are great examples.<br /><br />This is not a great example.  The plot-idea is that part of the VR world is in danger of crashing and taking a lot of people with it (including the main character's son).  But the book seems to start off slowly, some parts don't seem to make sense or click into place till you're halfway thru and tons of the novel seems to be tencho-babble.  In fact, some parts seem to be just plain made up on the spot.  I know reviewers sometimes say that, but in this case I mean it.  It has sci-fi stuff and, yes, Japanese businessmen and gangsters and VR and drugs and space stations - I'm sure William Gibson would be very proud.  But I happen to NOT like Mr. Gibson's style (and his work at least had some logic to it).<br /><br />Add Chi and zombies and a main character who can do anything (and get the girls) and it seems more like the wishful thinking of a 90's geek high on Jolt or no-doze.<br /><br />What scares me is he wrote a series of this books!	2005-08-24

I like a good mystery, I happen to be a sci-fi freak and I don't mind romance in a story.  Set around 2100 AD, Chicago, Angel Baker is a Retribution Specialist (people pay her to get back at criminals when the law can't).  She is strong, pretty and knows how to handle herself.  Sounds great.  What went wrong?<br /><br />Well, the setting seems more 21st Century than 22nd Century with some stuff tossed in hover-that and laser-this, and things kept confusing me.  I understand why the Russian Mafia is tough TODAY (they had to deal with the KGB), but the Russian Mafia of the 22nd Century has been in the USA for over a century dealing with a legal system that's in shambles.  Why is the author talking about how tough they are because \\"of relentless suffering in a failed communist economy\\"?  Just how OLD is the members of the Mafia or did Russia try communism a couple more times?<br /><br />And is the Mongolian gangsters from Mongolia or China?  Are they a little of both?  Or does she mean Inner Mongolia?  And why would they have slavery when they have androids?  Why use acid rounds and laser weapons when good, old fashion bullets would do?<br /><br />Also, the romance seemed rushed (and mostly off-screen/off-page for those of you wanting some action in the bed room).  Well, at least the plot made sense (when you ignored the flaws in the setting).  Some parts, like the old fashion train being kept as a tourist attraction, seemed to make sense and also added a touch of humor.<br /><br />I suggest getting it used.	2005-08-24

The reason this book gets four stars is because Harry Harrison did such a good job of building the foundation of the story.  He deals not just with the USA and England, but on how the European nations were dealing with the events, past and present.  A shot is not fired in anger till about page 128.  And even after the war there are chapters and chapters of post-war events to tie it all up.  Now if only the events and characters of the conflict were as realistic as the logic he used to set it up.  But if you've stayed with the series up to this third and last book you are already use to the grand and sweeping scenes that keep the plot moving.  Now I know the reason for the trilogy - Mr. Harrison wanted to find a way to free Ireland and Scotland!<br /><br />The plot drives the book, like the last two, and logic be damned.<br /><br />Fun, but that's all.	2005-08-16

By page 50 the Germans ARE in The USA!<br /><br />Very interesting and should be added to one's library, either as sci-fi or as historical fiction.	2005-08-13

Before I write anything else, let me point out that Grant and Lee don't fight against each other in battle, but each is stearing their forces as best they can, trying to step through a minefield of tactical and political traps.  I am not saying there is no combat - there's a ton of that.  But the fun part about this second book is exploring the many pathways available to Lee and his government now that they have won the Battle of Gettysburg.  Should they try to take Washington D.C. or head deeper into the Union?  Can they bring the European powers onto their side?<br /><br />Grant has issues also - what to do with the Army of the Potomac?  Should he go after Lee or defend the Capital?<br /><br />Or course both sides debate such issues such as slavery and how longer their own populace can handle such a deadly, painful war.<br /><br />The book has some surprising twists (which are not so surprising in hind-sight) and even the last few pages might seem shocking (unless you already know how U.S. Grant liked to fight a war).<br /><br />Equal to, if not better, than the first.  I look forward to Never Call Retreat.	2005-08-13

Neil Smith's works can get very heavy when he decides to debate and lecture instead of tell a tale.  In his book he tells a tale, a interesting one, in which he keeps the setting just that, a setting in the background, that colors the story and molds the characters reactions, but doesn't hit us like a hammer. I liked the cover - unlike many sci-fi books the cover shows a real event in the novel and is one of the reasons I grabbed it.	2005-08-13

It is stright forward, with stupid characters (as in slow to figure things out), semi-interesting alien race (who have class issues) and a creative idea that could have been handled better or made into an interesting series of books.<br /><br />I got this book because, when I was younger, I found Interstellar Pig interesting and thought the author might be able to write other books at the same level of skill.

About a year ago I saw the movie version of this book and realized, during the movie, that I knew what was going to happen.  Not the details, but the general flow of the film.  I had dim memories of having heard or seen the book before, somewhere, someplace, and ordered it from Amazon.com - and am so happy I did.<br /><br />It isn't fantasy nor is it Sci-Fi.  It seems to touch on the idea of using the fifth dimension to travel in space (and in time) and allows the characters, Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry and Calvin O'Keefes, to explore the universe.  Well, first they have to rescue Meg's father who has fallen into the hands of the forces of evil.<br /><br />The book was interesting, asking many questions young adults ask themselves and also left me wondering about things.

One day I brought in this one and we listened to her, half an hour a day, with her lovely voice till, I assume it only took a week, it was done.  I think she enjoyed it also - a story set in an English village by an English author.<br /><br />For only a 133 pages this is a very well crafted story.

They had the numbers and they lacked any fear of men.  Soon the public knew that a war had started - a war that London might NOT win.<br /><br />The book really pushed buttons.

Yet how would they do this?  With Ancestor-Science which had failed against the Monsters? Or with Alien-Science which they could not understand?  Or did they need to try something new?<br /><br />On top of that is the infighting, between those who have power and those who did not.

I happened to see Robert Sullivan on Book TV and found the subject of his book very interesting.  To me rats are one of nature's amazing animals - mostly because they have learned to survive right under our feet.  So I did end up getting the book.  In fact I started it last night and finished it earlier today.  I could not put it down.<br /><br />While the book does dive right into the nature of the beast - how rats bred, live and die - it also shows us the history of New York from a rat's point of view.  It was educational AND fun to read.  I wonder if the New York school system has thought about making it part of their history classes?<br /><br />After 250 pages I still wanted more!<br /><br />The best thing is the author treats the rats as we should - he neither loved them nor hated them.  They were rats - survivors who are tough enough to live in our cities yet smart enough to stay out of our way (most of the time).  As the author pointed out they 'overpopulate, fight over limited food supplies, and then go to war until the population is killed down' just like we do.  But we have the bigger brains - what's our excuse?	2005-07-21

We follow her as she lives the life of an ant, from foraging for food, surviving attack from red slave-making ants, to feeding the young and preparing for winter.  The Alice Hopf writes a story that seems amazing, yet is based on fact, with realistic artwork by Jean Zallinger, a naturalist artist.  The book, if you can find a copy, is great for kids but be warned, Rufa's friend, Missing Claw, is killed by enemy ants so really young kids might get upset.	2005-07-20

At first I thought the book was going to be a tale of mankind's fall - a Plant has come to Earth that sucks up the water, grows fast (becoming the size of a maple in a month) and destroys the land.  Nothing can live near it and few things can live on it.<br /><br />But small pockets of men live and fight back.  They protect the land, grow food, keep animals and do what they can to survive.  I figured we were no longer King of the Hill but mankind would still fight on.<br /><br />Then the story seems to change.  There are machines that hunt down anything that may hurt the Plants.  Mankind is nothing but a type of aphid hunted by robotic ladybugs - with flamethrowers.<br /><br />The aliens are never seen - only their machines.  Maybe there are ONLY machines carrying out the operations in the first place - how many farmers are needed to run a farm in the 21th Century?<br /><br />And that is what the Plants are - seeds placed on Earth to be grown and harvested.  It seems any planet would have been OK as one as it had water and lots of sunlight.<br /><br />The ending is sad but realistic - maybe this is how an alien invasion would happen.  We would be so below their notice that not even their machines would tell us apart from the deer or cattle they also hunt down and kill.	2005-07-20

First, before you get the book, there are three stories within the covers -<br /><br />1 - The history of the study of human evolution, focused on the debate between single origin and multiregional origins.<br /><br />2 - The discoveries made by Carl C. Swisher III and Garniss H. Curtis about Homo erectus and how this changed many of the ideas (or just clouded things even more).<br /><br />3 - How science really works, with the egos, the money issues, the insults, the old guard against the new ideas and how each side slams into each other till somebody screams uncle and somebody wins.  Logic seems to have nothing to do with it.<br /><br />At only 235 pages it does seem small, but the chapters are clear and simple, with more than enough details and examples to make everything easy to understand.  They did a great work at explaining how technology has changed over the years when it comes to figuring out the age of an object.  Yet I never felt like I was being talked down to.<br /><br />The only problem is that having been published in 2000 it makes you wonder what the 'hobbits' would have done to their ideas.	2005-07-20

There is a crime - well, a hit and run, that may BE a crime - a murder.  Archie and Nero are hired to clear it up - was Waldo Wilmot Moore murdered or was his death an accident?  The Wall Street Firm he use to work at must know or it might damage its image - you know how that is.<br />The problem comes down to the fact that there are hundreds of female employees, and a few male ones, who could have wanted him dead.<br />The story, like many of the Nero Wolfe mysteries is detailed, complex and, near the end, with a surprise.  The only problem is that this story seems to move slower than most and, like Archie and Nero, you start to become a tad frustrated with the rest of the people in the novel - they seem short-sighted, sly, dense and sometimes rude.<br />The end, like most endings of the Nero Wolfe series, is still somewhat a surprise (and even a tad sad depending on your point of view).	2005-07-18

Giant wasps appear about the same time we do something really stupid - nuclear tests crack the Earth's crust like an egg shell.  The landscape was changed, cities destroyed and new oceans formed where there were none.<br /><br />Now that mankind is down there comes the kick in the side - the wasps attacks!<br /><br />Where did they come form and why are they here?

I had an ant farm, I absorbed hundreds of books on ants, bees, wasps and termites.  I watched PBS specials and National Geographic shows whenever the topic was about any one of the above creatures.<br /><br />So, when I found this book only a few years ago I bought it on the spot.<br /><br />The story is good but I have been spoiled by my knowledge of how social insects, like ants, really work together, so much of the story seems silly to me.  As a child I would have loved it but as an adult who finds facts to be more wonderful than any fiction, it didn't really do anything for me.<br /><br />It is fantasy, pure and simple, yet it reminds us about another world.  While hiking only a few weeks ago, me and a friend, found a few yards of the path covered with a swarm of large ants.  They seemed to be searching, foraging, all working together - none that I could see were fighting each other so I assume they were all from the same nest.  There must have been thousands on the path and in the grass bordering it.  My friend pointed out that there was a jungle right under our feet.<br /><br />The ants ignored us even as we tried to walk down the path without stepping on them.  We were not of their world - not even dangerous giants to flee from.  Maybe we were like a storm or a flash flood - a part of nature that they can't do anything about so why get upset over it?<br /><br />A good book for a child but not really for an adult unless that person had it as a child and had good memories of it.	2005-07-15

First published in 1954 the author, John Crompton, used as many sources as he could, including some first hand experience with ants, to write a detailed, if somewhat colorful, book on them.  Driver ants, slave-making ants, leaf-cutting ants, harvester ants and more are explored with humor, some common sense and lots of wonder.  The only flaw is the author's understanding of evolution.  While he uses Darwin's name a lot his ideas about how ants changed seem to be backwards.  It almost sounds like he thinks ants PLANNED out their changes or changed to suit the changing world.  The Driver ants can't try out certain seeds to see if it will allow the colony to survive without meat any more than I can make a new race of wood-eating cats by forcing the first generation of kittens to eat wood.  Natural selection only goes so far.  Cats do eat grass but they don't live on it.<br />Still fun to read and compare to our newer knowledge about ants and their ways.	2005-07-14

Anderson poured all of Mr. Wells's works together to make a grand novel I feel I would have liked more details about the civilizations on both the Moon and Mars.  Yet the author was willing to invent and create many parts of the book on his own - I enjoyed the idea that the Heat-Ray was being used for something else besides war - so he did not allow himself to be trapped by what could only be found in the books.  I also enjoyed the mixture of real people, such as Mr. Lowell, with fictional characters, such as Professor Redwood and Mr. Bensington.	2005-07-09

Being a fan of such authors as Stephen Baxter, Fred Saberhagen and Mercedes Lackey I couldn't put it down once I had it in my greedy little hands.  With articles about Mars, how the novel effected sci-fi (and history in general), and even just fun sections on how smart the Martians REALLY were, this is a treasure.  Also, many of the authors, in passing, mention other books and movies that have also taken the alien invasion theme from Wells and carried it onwards (many of which I have and many of which I don't have) - spin offs and such.  This makes it a great source for finding sci-fi novels and movies that you might not have yet.<br /><br />A must for any fan, young or old.	2005-07-08

From the West comes Patton and Rommel while Stalin and his forces roll in from the East.  Tank battles, spies and superweapons fill the pages of this novel.<br /><br />It may seem simple - the jaws are closing on Berlin.  But nothing is ever so simple.  First, Himmler and his loyal SS units are not just going to let themselves get stomped on without a fight.  And there is also the Final Soution which they have to be cover up.<br /><br />Also, Stalin wants Berlin, treaty or no treaty.  And he plans to take it, Allies or no Allies.	2005-06-25

I am a huge fan of anime and also of the Japanese culture and history.  I figured that this book would be interesting.  I heard good things about it and bad things about it but wanted to judge it myself.<br /><br />First - it was first published in 2000 which means that the anime scene has already changed greatly.  In fact, many of the points made in the book would have been outdated by the time it was printed.<br /><br />Second - she seems to focus a lot of sex.  Now that may be because much of her information, and the anime she selected to view, came from University students or stores who supplied students.  The idea that pornography is a _major current_ within the world of anime is a interesting but flawed statement.  Erotic anime makes up a small corner of the anime produced in Japan and it has greater sales abroad than in its homeland.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that Non-Japanese would be the main target for this type of anime - which means trying to understand the Japanese male-female relationship via adult anime is also flawed.  But it might tell us alot about American and European college students.<br /><br />She has tons of interesting points to make but the foundations she builds to hold them up seem weak and shaky.  For example,  she talks about men's insecurity and their need for Mecha using sci-fi shows where most of the pilots are female.  She uses sources about American Superheros to talk about Japanese characters.<br /><br />Also, while she did mention a Tenchi movie, she seems to skip the Tenchi Muyo! TV shows.  What about Dominion Tank Police, Gall Force, Martian Successor Nadesico, Wings of Honneamise, any of the Gundam shows or even Dirty Pair?  I don't think she even once writes about CLAMP!<br /><br />In other words, while she does get into detail about a few areas of anime, she is far from covering it all.  So buyer beware and buy it used.<br /><br />I would also suggest _The Erotic Anime Movie Guide_ by Helen McCarthy and Jonathan Clements for the history and true understanding of erotic anime.  For understanding mainstream anime I would suggest _Anime Explosion_ by Patrick Drazen, _Samurai From Outer Space_ by Antonia Levi and _The Anime Companion_ by Gulles Poitras.  ^_^nd true understanding of erotic anime.

Bushido is not a science and it's not easy to understand.  It is made up of many parts, each designed to carefully balance each other.  Justice, Courage and Loyalty are just some of the ingredients needed to be added in just the right amounts.  Too much can be as bad as too little.  A man worried just about Justice might forget about Benevolence and a man worried about Honor might forget about Politeness.<br /><br />Bushido is not like a coat, that you can put on and take off, but a way of life.

But when strange things start to happen, as in a high level monster attacking low level players, the administrators know something is going on.  Now the real adventure will begin.<br /><br />The first volume is kind of slow, mostly dealing with the players and their interaction.

Forstchen get together to write a very realistic Civil War novel about what would have happened if Robert E. Lee decided to carry out a sweeping, massive movement to out-flank the Union Army.  Unlike most books about the Civil War, this book tosses out luck and almost magical changes in the thoughts of the main characters, basing the action and combat on the reality of the men and the leaders within both armies.<br /><br />The battle scenes are painfully real, causing me to feel horror at some of details.  Both authors refuse to hide anything, showing the heroism and the gore that was the Civil War battlefield.<br /><br />A must for a What-If library or a Civil War library!	2005-05-31

If it was just pure sci-fi without the lecturing OR a libertarian sci-fi book with a more realistic setting, I would have given it five stars.  As it is, it is good enough for four.<br /><br />The main character, Emerson Ngu, escapes from a U.N. colony on the terraformed asteroid of Pallas.  Outside the colony people have set up a libertarian paradise.  The book, the plot, is mostly the powers that be trying to bring him back OR, failing that, destroy the libertarian utopia.<br /><br />This story is like The Probability Broach, where the main character is placed in a new society and, by learning the ropes, we learn a lot about the author's views on gun control, hunting, and the common good.  If you're a libertarian, that's OK.  If you're NOT, then it's just too much, too confusing, and maybe even enough to make a person give up after the first few chapters.<br /><br />If you're new to Mr. Smith I would suggest taking the book slowly.	2005-05-30

Bevin Alexander takes some of the great generals out of history and examines why they did so well.  The author tries to point out the common traits and tactics each general shared.  The selection of generals is interesting - Jackson and Sherman are picked over Lee and Grant.<br /><br />But Mr. Alexander is also willing to point out some of the bad choices that these good generals sometimes made.  Napoleon, for example, did great in Italy but in latter battles used frontal attacks instead of mobility and misdirection.  He let the size of his army get in the way of good generalship.<br /><br />The final chapter tries to tie it all together, listing simple ideas or rules, that all great generals followed.	2005-05-25

The authors in this book point out that if the South had focused on defending itself instead of attacking Union troops during battles (not even counting the two failed invasions of the North by Lee) they might have had a chance.  Yet the authors also show that the South had no choice - their generals took from West Point (and the Mexican War) all the wrong lessons - that tactical offensive would always win the day.  Before rifled weapons, when the musket was the main weapon of the ground forces, men COULD get close enough to use the bayonet and use it well.  I have seen studies that showed many battles during the Pre-Rifle period (American Revolution, War of 1812) was decided by the bayonet - those killed were mostly killed by the bayonet.  Muskets were too ineffective.<br />Rifles changed all that.  It changed everything but American generals, mostly those of the South, refused to change their ways.  But then why didn't the people say something to make them change their ways?  The authors suggest that this also had to do with the culture of the South - that they were Celtic in their ways and thoughts.  So the people approved of the tactics, even when it meant defeat!<br />While that part of the book seems weak, most of it I can agree with.  This book DOES list a ton of facts and I suggest it only for those who already know a lot about the American Civil War.	2005-05-19

A simple mountain pass with spas and sheep.  And it was the passageway for the Persian army to taking over Greece.  Between them and the city-states stood 300 Spartan warriors.<br /><br />So history says.<br /><br />But the best part of the book by Steven Pressfield is he doesn't forget the rest of them.  While his novel shows us the Spartan life-style - their military training and how they came to overcome their fears - he also shows us those other warriors, those allies of Sparta, such as the Thespians, soldiers who came to fight along side their fellow-Greeks.  And stayed to die along side them.<br /><br />Freedom always comes with a price.  And if you're not willing to pay it don't complain about the chains you wear.	2005-05-14

First off, let me point out that the author, Michael Boulter, likes what he does and you can feel his enjoyment through the book as he explains, in great detail, about evolution and extinction, what it is, how it comes about and how scientists have tried to understand it.  So when it comes to explaining just how long mankind may, or may not, live you can't help but believe him.  You've followed his logic, his examples, his stories from the first chapter to the last.  You trust him, even when you sometimes get lost a little, you end up following him thru the maze of data.  So when he gets to the point where you realize that he is going to be laying bad news on you, you can't help but believe him.  It's like St. Nick telling you that you're pet is going to be hit by a car.  Jolly St. Nick wouldn't lie to you, so it must be true.<br /><br />Whether the answers to mankind's fate in the final chapter is true or not, it is a interesting book, with lots of ideas to chew on.

And if nothing is done the solar system, at least the inner planets, only have a few centuries to live.<br /><br />Daniel comes back as a cyborg - super-power, super-fast, able to see heat and radar and so on.<br /><br />Besides the details of the future, which seem to be somewhat realistic, well balanced, neither a Paradise nor a Hell, I found Daniel, and the other characters, somewhat childish.  In other words, the characters were self-centered, selfish, greedy and therefore very real.  Very human.<br /><br />I also like how the story went slowly from hard sci-fi to soft, fantasy, sci-fi.  You have as much trouble believing what is happening almost as much as the main characters.  Another sign of a good story - you sometimes find yourself on Daniel's side, feeling he is right to be upset.<br /><br />As for the ending, yes, it leaves so many questions unanswered, but this is the FIRST of a two book series.  The next book, Galaxy's End, continues where this one ends.<br /><br />Good rainy day book - nothing too complex.  Lots of fun ideas.	2005-04-02

You were born on a spaceship traveling between two galaxies.  You now can select which planet, and therefore which galaxy, you will now be a citizen of.  Which planet will you go to?  What adventures will you have in getting there?  Will you find either of them?<br /><br />No likely.  Space is full of black holes, wars and hostile races.  Will you give up your search and join the Universe Governing Body to try to bring peace to the galaxies?  Or will you pick a side to fight on, joining in the wars?  Will you travel in time, explore new worlds or go to school?<br /><br />Most of the 44 possible endings seem to be your death or some vague ending without any real meaning.  I'm surprised that, as a kid, I kept trying to find the endings I wanted.	2005-04-01

You were aboard a supersonic jet, going from New York to Paris, when a huge, gleaming white cylinder shoots out of the clouds.  The next thing you know you are inside the spaceship the Rakma, a captive of the U-TY, masters of the space craft.<br /><br />Will you cooperate, pretend to cooperate or try to escape?  What you decide to do might free you or enslave you for life.  This Choose Your Own Adventure book seems a tad more logical.  Choices sometimes result in major changes.  The story line is interesting and the artwork by Paul Granger is cool.  There is even a layout of the spaceship.  The character of Kim Lee is even cute!  One of the better of the series.	2005-04-01

Can you prove how extinction came about?  All you need to do is find the last dinosaur and bring back a tooth to prove you found the answer.<br /><br />The Time Machine series is kind of like Choose You Own Adventure books, but lacks the younger versions' logic loops (that you can sometimes get trapped into) and death scenes.  You can't die in a Time Machine book and your choices have effects that seem to be logical.  You also end up learning alot even as you flee giant flesh-eating dinosaurs.	2005-04-01

The source happens to be from the third planet in orbit around Altair, a yellow-white star 16 light years away.

There are space stations, cities on the moon and a huge demand for more resources.  And whereever man goes he takes his trash with him.  Disused satellites, fuel tanks and other space junk makes it dangerous just moving about in orbit.  The young Hachimaki works as a orbital garbage man but he has bigger plans in mind.

This book is great, full of goofs, interesting dialogue, the roots (sources) of many of the stories, fashions, screw ups and lots of humor.  But while the book examines each and every episode it does not tell you what happened within the episode.  In other words, it tells you how something does not make sense without telling you WHY it didn't make sense.  UNLESS you have ALREADY seen the episode.  In other words, if you are a fan, this is the book for you.  But if you are new to Doctor Who? this won't make sense.  In other words there is no summary of any of the plots.<br /><br />So, for a fan, it is five stars.  For a person new to the show, it is worthless untill AFTER they watch a few episodes.<br /><br />ENJOY!	2005-03-28

Made by science writers and experts of science this book is a must for any Stargate fan.  There are two essays which focus on wormholes, one essay debates fashion, one essay even gets into parasites and much more.  Not a lot on the military but with such authors as Bill Fawcett, Susan Sizemore and P.N. Elrod I could not help but buy this book.  Full of humor and a love for the Stargate.  And everybody talks like Jack!  Ya think?	2005-03-25

Burroughs novels about Mars.  John Carter is a vet of the American Civil War and a Captain who fought for Virginia (and therefore the wrong side).  He ends up, after some adventures, on Mars.  A stranger in a very strange land, he tries to better his position, mostly by killing others natives who attack him or attack other natives.<br /><br />First, this is soft science fiction, fantasy fiction at best.  Star Wars is hard science fiction when compared to this book.  More swords than laser guns, the Hero spends most of his time explaining how backwards the people of Mars are, all the cities are in ruins, the landscape a wasteland and so on.  Mars is full of wild men, wild creatures and states at war.  John Carter, being from Earth, can jump farther, run faster, fight better than anybody else.<br /><br />This is a male's fantasy not REAL science fiction.  There is nothing here but a male point of view, mixed with wish fulfillment, tons of action and adventure, a weak plot and no theme (unless you count some racism and sexism).  You know when somebody says they could write a better story?  Well, anybody could have done a better story.  Add some more realistic details, better names, and cut down on the bad B-movie lines pouring out of the characters' lips and you could improve on it without even thinking.<br /><br />Why does it seem so dated when other books from the same period still hold up?  Oh, by the way, the book itself was very nice and well made.  Print On Demand is great.	2005-03-18

Very much like Earth, the world has lush forests, breathable air and a temperate climate. It even has cities, roads and farm land.  But after landing they found a terrifying truth - humans are savage beasts and apes are the masters of the world.<br /><br />Everybody compares the book to Gulliver's Travels.  I have to agree but that is as far as it goes.  The book feels slightly dated - the science fiction is too simple.  All Pierre does is replace humans with apes.  We barely get a feel of the culture, history or nature of the civilized apes.  But the book is not a true sci-fi novel.  It was meant to be a mirror, to reflect human stupidity back onto the readers.<br /><br />It's fun in it's own way - but I still had to drop a point.	2005-03-11

The Ape movies were not just mirrors to show us our racial problems but also to show solutions to them.  But it wasn't just about race, but also about foreign affairs such as the Cold War and the Vietnam Conflict, religion vs. science, nature vs. nurture, the fears of a nuclear holocaust, even our treatment of animals and how we treat women.<br /><br />The book really helped me to understand the movies with a detailed background about the times in which the movies were created.  The book also has a touch of humor even while explaining about what the films were trying to say or show.  Sometimes without even knowing it.	2005-03-10

First off, this is not really a novelization of the final movie, but of the screenplay.  For example, the movie had three hunters, the book has five - The first drafts of the film started out with five hunters.  Also, the first chapter is set in 2000 BC and the second in 1904, so the book lays more of a foundation for the plot than the movie.  Of course a book can get into details and character's thoughts, so it seems a tad more complex.  I really enjoyed it, but thought more could have been done with both the Predators and the Aliens.	2005-03-08

Not only do all three Marionettes show up, but so do all three Saber Dolls.  Like in the anime Otaru Mamiya lives on a colony world which has no females.  Marionettes are robots designed to look like women, but they don't really act like women.  Until Otaru finds Marionettes with Maiden Circuits - the circuitry that allows them to have emitions.  The action and artwork is kind of confusing and with the amount of nudity and extra-plus size busts this is not for kids.  It is sometimes hard to tell when a Saber Marionette/Saber Doll is topless or just wearing a very clean, tight-fitting white top.<br /><br />In fact it is rated for Age 16 and older.  Comes with a extra short-story at the end.  Lots of Benny Hill humor and bleeding noses but not as touching as the anime.  Not yet.	2005-03-05

In fact, in 1912 it was outright replaced by another Europe.  A wild Europe, full of wild plants and animals not of THIS Earth.  Many believe it to be a act of divine punishment and others are not so sure, but in the end it will change the future of the Earth.  Or is that our past?<br /><br />The book starts out kind of weak to begin with, with three major plot threads.  Only one seems to deal with Darwina and that was the reason I wanted to read the book.  I am not sure I would compare it to the work of Jules Verne or H.G. Wells, but it does have the feel of a Lovecraft or E.R. Burroughs book.  Half way thru the story the author tosses in a dash of Olaf Stapledon.  Lifts whole themes right out of _The Star Maker_ which did make it slightly more readable for me.<br /><br />In the end it just got three stars and I don't think I will be looking for this author's other books unless somebody I trust tells me to.	2005-02-16

This book has samples of Barlowe's commissioned works for book covers, magazines, newpapers and other clients. It even has chapters about dinosaurs paintings he did for a book (and for fun), projects of the past and projects he is doing for the future.

Many of you either do not have the manga or want to get it but already have the anime series and movies, so why double up?  That was my worry, so I asked around.  Sure, I have the Tenchi Muyo anime and manga, but the manga starts after the anime.  And sure I have the Oh My Goddess anime. movies and manga, but the manga has a lot more detail.  But if the Love Hina manga and anime are the same I didn't want to waste my time.  And money.<br /><br />Everybody I asked said the manga was better, the manga was better, the anime was great but the manga was better.  So I got the first three volumes.<br /><br />The story in the manga goes fast, really fast.  All the main characters are already at the dorm, even Shinobu, and the plot gets started in the very first few pages.  There is lots of humor, fanservice, poor Keitaro getting abused and great artwork, so the rating of ages 16 and older is a good rule.<br /><br />Unless the standards of the manga go down I will most likely end up trying to collect them all.	2005-02-06

The first part deals with how fish developed their body to live on land and the second explains how some mammals changed to go back and live in the water.  The author explains how evolution, both micro and macro, works and gives us a tiny history of how Darwin's idea of natural selection changed how we thought about life on Earth.<br />The book not only tosses in a few new ideas, like early fish might of had both gills AND lungs, but but also shows how paletontolgy, ecology, genetics and embryology are being used to solve the secrets of macroevilution that biologists have been trying to uncover for centuries.<br />Carl Zimmer knows his stuff and knows how to explain it without confusing the readers.	2005-02-05

I saw Spencer Wells on Book TV talking about his book and TV special, so when I found the book in paperback I snapped it up.  And I am very happy I did.  I knew a lot of the history he went over to explain why and how the Y-chromosome could be used to trace human evolution and how humans spread over the world.  The reason I enjoyed it so much is that I have many of the books he used as sources and it allowed me to read without those full halts that sometimes happens when you hide an idea or fact you never heard of before.<br /><br />But even people who have no knowledge how DNA works or have no idea how our prehistoric forefathers lived will find the book interesting and easy to absorb.<br /><br />The Y-chromosome not only helps us trace the male DNA back to Africa, it is also shown to help answer once and all questions about language families and even how the knowledge of farming spread.<br /><br />The language used in the book is easy to understand and Mr. Wells knows how to explain even complex issues with humor and clarity.<br /><br />Some information about Homo erectus/ergaster in Asia MIGHT be out-dated with the discovery of Homo floresiensis (Hobbits), but the data about Homo sapiens is still sound.	2005-02-01

I was really turned on by many of the plots and even enjoyed the after word from the artist herself.<br /><br />To me her artwork and stories are better than that of Yukimino Yukio.  While both know what readers want, she seems to add a little more in spice.  One story is about two girls and was even touching in how it was done.<br /><br />The five stars were earned.

In fact, some are not even stories, just short scenes.  Some humor, group sex, a couple of cases of rape and a few people even seem to die.  Oh, bananas, cheerleaders and panties.  Think porn in manga form, with little or no plot.  If you like that kind of thing, good for you, but I was looking for something more.  Kind of costed a lot for something so thin.

And I found a great manga of robot stories which are touching, warm and sometimes tragic.  They are lovers, mothers and sometimes the mirrors that allow us to see the truth within outselves.  After all, robots can't lie, no matter how much we lie to ourselves.  Great artwork and nice stand alone stories.  Already have the second volume and enjoy that one too!	2005-01-24

Expedition is about an artist's voyage to Darwin Four, in 2358 A.D.  The book is his collection of drawings and sketches made during the first manned mission to the planet.  Mr. Barlowe is not just an artist, but also has great knowledge about nature and how it works.  He tries to mix the two, showing the aliens and explaining how they lived, mated and, sometimes, died.  But he leaves so much out - there is very little background on the planet's natural history.  We get hints and clues about what early life was like.  For example, most creatures use sonar and have biolights, yet are blind.  Being blind, the sonar makes sense, but why have biolights then?  The atmosphere must have been thick and murky, allowing animals armed with sonar better chances than those armed with eyes, but could the biolights be something from earlier times, before sonar was developed and all animals used visible light?<br /><br />The science, in other words, is lacking the details I enjoy.  It is a great art book, but Dougal Dixon is better at the science, showing evolution and how it works.  This is an alien planet and we barely touched the surface of its wonders!<br /><br />That is why it only gets three points.	2005-01-20

Because we have a soul or mind?  Can we even prove those things exist?  Because we have culture and works of art?  But don't machines now write stories and don't chimps paint?<br />Will we ever find something to define us as humans when we don't even know what being human means?

And she is a tom boy. Because of that she gets a lot of male parts in the plays and she hates it, but what can she do?  Nothing, but shut up and be Romeo.<br /><br />Makoto Amano, a transfer student, has been selected to be Juliet and Tsugumi, a lovely, but vain female student at the school, wants the part to be close to Ito.  Or maybe just because she is vain.<br /><br />That sounds normal, but there's more.  One of them is not a girl.  The only problem I have with this manga is that I'm not sure there IS going to be a volume two, three or four.  Besides that, it's funny, has great artwork and good character designs.	2004-12-26

This book holds a lot of thought for only 130 pages.  Franz Metcalf takes his knowledge of Buddhism to answer now just the big questions of \\"Life\\", but the smaller questions of daily life.  What would Buddha do or think about such subjects as failure, anger, road rage, gun control, lying, the environment, eating meat, money, sex, drinking, drug abuse, boredom and even prostitution.  Hard issues, but each is given a page, answered with a quote from Buddhist teaching and advice from the author.<br /><br />Great gift for a friend or a gift for yourself.  It really helps you strip away the fat and get to the very core of the subject in question.	2004-12-20

Richard Matheson, the great author who wrote 'I Am Legend' and many other short horror stories and science fiction stories, explores his knowledge of life after death by pouring it into a story.  A story about Chris Nielsen, a man who has died and has left everything behind.  He wants to stay, to be with his wife and his family, but he can't.  He must move on, he must learn about life after death.  What is death?  What is life?  What is love?	2004-12-17

First off, the first 6 acts are great, with lots of action, good character designs and allows you great insight into the characters themselves.  The anime pretty much follows this manga, with only a few changes.  There is a cool glossary in the back and character information is spread through-out.  A bonus story in the end is in fact the FIRST story - Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story.  This short story came out a year before the Rurouni Kenshin series - the star is left unnamed, but we all know who he is.  Volume One is truly a great gift for fans of the anime, of Japanese history or of cool sword fights!	2004-12-13

Will it help get her career on track or is it just a deal with the Devil?

Rashomon Emi, a 19 year old female bounty hunter, fights crime with special outfits, special weapons and a heart so filled with greed that she makes Faye from Cowboy Bebop look (and act) like a nun.  IF you love blood, cool one liners and lots of fan service than this is the manga for you.<br /><br />Best part is, that while it says Volume One, this is it.  No waiting half-a-year for the next volume.  And the next one after that.  One book, all 11 episodes, no waiting.<br /><br />The only thing I don't understand is why she is called Bomber Girl.  She didn't use any bombs - but she does make a mess out of the bad guys.  That's got to be it.<br /><br />Suggested for ages 17 and up.  Adult manga with lots of action and comedy.  You could give it to somebody SLIGHTLY younger, but this rating seems correct, so don't give it to anybody under 15.	2004-12-10

Adventures, Gods, magic and wrestling.  Most of the stories are good, but you can tell that many of the authors didn't work together.  One story says the City of Thebes was long gone, while another said it still existed.  And in one story, about the battle of Salamis, Xena CARES about what the Greek Gods think about her.

Nanako Momoi may have been cute on the outside, but she is anything but cute on the inside.  And once inside Akira Uehara's body it turns out she prefers being a boy!  And what's worse is she seems to be better at being a boy than she was at being a girl.<br />Akira Uehara is also having mixed feelings.  On one hand he is now trapped in her body.  On the other hand he is trapped in the body of a petite and adorable girl he had a crush on.  And it seems he is ALSO better at being a girl than HE was being a boy.<br />Things get WEIRD after that, but you'll have to buy the book to figure it out.	2004-11-27

Yeah, that kind of surprised me too, till I figured out why - it is no longer based on our REAL history.  It has gone so far off track that Harry Harrison can write it anyway he wants and as long as he keeps to the logic and reality he set up in the first book it works.  I also loved the scene between John Ericsson and William P. Parrott as well as the scene between Mr. Ericsson and Captain Raphael Semmes.<br /><br />But most of the book feels rushed and the characters are bland, cut out paper dolls, set up to do certain actions and say certain things for the plot to go in THAT direction.<br /><br />Anyway, the plot is England and allied European nations invade Mexico.  The invasion of the US is just around the corner and Lincoln decides he has to do something about it.  So they decide the best way to open a second front and force Britain to withdraw its troops is to invade Ireland.<br /><br />It sounds simple, but even Mr. Harrison shows that the United States Army and Navy would have a few problems they couldn't foresee.<br /><br />But after 334 pages you know there is going to be a third book.	2004-11-19

The swift moving plot, the realistic police methods, the interesting characters, all make for a complete story which never lets you get away - you're hooked from the first page.  Much of the story, like many of Frederick Forsyth's books, depend mostly on the characters, how they think, what actions they take or fail to take.  This story does not rely on advanced computer systems, super weapons or sinister plots carried out by ex-Nazis from underground bases in South America.<br /><br />In other words, a good story no matter when you read it.	2004-11-16

James Bond watch out, this perfumer for CRI Cosmetics has more skills and talents than just having a good nose.  Najica is a special operative who travels about the world attacking evildoers and saving important people.  Her partner, Lila, is in fact a Humaritt, a kind of robot.  Together they get into some serious trouble but always seem to get out again.<br /><br />The first book starts some time after the first anime episode, where Najica rescues Lila, but well before the end of the series.  Lila is still trying to act like a normal girl, with mixed results.<br /><br />The skirts ARE shorter, the busts bigger and the stories are fast flowing (no need for fillers in a manga).  Rated for 16 and up, but I bet younger readers could handle it.	2004-11-07

But I found I didn't enjoy reading the book - it seemed slow and sometimes dull.  Maybe because I am not a fan of the TV show, having only seen a few episodes.  Or maybe because I had to read the second book first as the first book has yet to get to me.  It could be that I just don't have knowledge about the background, what type of vampires I am dealing with and no real information about the characters.  Richard is not like ANY other vampire in any of P.N. Elrod's other vampire series, so I had no real idea when he was in danger or when he wasn't.<br /><br />But even taking that away, to be honest, I found parts of the book felt slow, with flashbacks that I didn't think added to the story, and a surprise ending, a twisted ending, that I didn't really believe in.  In other words, even if I was a fan of the TV show, I might found it hard to plow thru.<br /><br />In the end I had to take away three points.  Please remember, that I am not a fan of Forever Night, because I don't watch it daily, and fans of the show, or of Nigel Bennett, might enjoy the book more.  PLUS I have yet to read \\"Keeper of the King\\". But I won't suggest it for P.N. Elrod fans UNLESS they also like the show or have some knowledge of its setting.	2004-11-05

While Joan Mellen tries to be very complete, with lots of information on the cultural background, use of sound, light and stories about the cast, the book barely touches the surface of the movie.  Of course, with less than 80 pages, there is only so much you can do.  Also, the information is not well ordered, bouncing about a lot.  Some of the space is kind of wasted on attacking people who, themselves, attacked Kurosawa and his greatest film.<br /><br />A great little book, but I bet there are larger, more massive tomes about the subject.	2004-11-01

He is from DC Comics.<br />Plus hundreds of real or fictional soldiers, spies and fliers.  As gripping and detailed as the first book, but it felt better made - I plowed through it with great speed.

The Hellsing Ultimate Fan Guide, #1, is not as ultimate as it could be.  With summaries of the first six episodes, character bios, details on the setting, info on the locations, data on the organizations, and character sheets for using the Hellsing background within the anime RPG game _Big Eyes, Small Mouth_ plus all the extras in images and pictures you would think I would give it 5 out of 5.  But the whole book is kind of weak.  For example, the episode summaries only take three pages per episode, leaving out much of the cool dialogue and lots of the details.  Some sections, like the page on Arucard's gloves, the pages on Hellsing's equipment and the page where they compare Vampire Myths and Vampires within the Hellsing Universe have little or no depth.  But at 80 pages there isn't really a lot of room to hold much more.<br /><br />As I have BESM and other books by Guardians Of Order, I plan to get Fan Guide #2.

Within the 200 plus pages are not just six chapters of Hellsing dealing with rogue vampires, ghouls and Priests, but a extra in the form of a bonus story from a manga that never got off the ground about Section XIII(13), the special vampire hunting organization from Rome.<br /><br />I can't wait to see the other manga in the Hellsing series.	2004-10-02

I've red my share of utopian stories and while they are fun, they are nothing close to being real.<br /><br />THIS book is as close to the real thing as you can get.  The author spends over 300 pages building it up, allowing us to see the good and bad of Freehold via the eyes of Kendra Pacelli, and then uses 300 pages trying to let the United Nations destroy it all.  No holding back, no magic tricks, no saving Freehold with a super-weapon invented in a underground lab nobody knew about.  The characters are sometimes loving, sometimes enraged and sometimes are just this close to just plain wanting to sit down and give up.  The end is both shocking and ruthless, and I'm sure it can't be called a happy ending.  But maybe it was the only ending that fits.<br /><br />This book touches on everything from business to rape, from the joining the military to getting a job.	2004-09-15

Another Fine Myth is the first book in what became one of the best fantasy series EVER!  Not only is it full of magic, monsters and mayhem but it also has lots of humor.  Sheeve was a apprentice, until his teacher dies and leaves him with a powerless demon named Aahz, a couple of assassins and a evil magician who wishes to rule ALL the dimensions.<br /><br />Few people can mix humor and fantasy such as Robert Asprin.  And this book is not just the first novel, but also holds the follow-up, Myth Conceptions.  In the second book Sheeve go to the court to try to become the Court Magician of Rodrick the Fifth.  The amazing part is he gets the job with Aahz's help.  But he finds, to his horror, that his first assignment is to stop the largest army the world has ever seen.  All by himself.<br /><br />The only other author I can think of, off the top of my head, who can pull off this mixture of humor and serious fantasy is Steven Brust.	2004-08-23

Before I talk about the story, you need to know two things about the book.<br /><br />First, the story is set in the universe of the Union-Alliance novels, yet you don't need those books to know what's going on.  The book is a stand alone and has lots of information in the back with maps, chapters on history, fashion and even language.<br /><br />Second, this was meant to be the first in a series of books, very much like the Thieves' World series, but instead of a walled city of the Middle-Ages filled with magic and crime, this was more like a city-state of Italy (during the Renaissance) filled with politics and, sometimes, guns.<br /><br />And the series did go on as other authors added their own skill and stories to the books that followed.<br /><br />Now, for the story.  Like all of her books, C.J. Cherryh starts small, with a character we think of as normal and a daily event.  Altair Jones, the main female character, rescues a man who is tossed into one of the canals.  This is normal - bodies are always being tossed in by gangs.  But he lived and happens to be a high-born.  He also happens to be in the middle of something that seems to get bigger and bigger as the story moves along.  By saving him Altair might have also gotten herself involved with a mess that could end up with HER in the canals.<br /><br />The dangers increase as the knots in this plot are untied and we get close to the truth about what is going on and why.  C.J. Cherryh is an artist, crafting the story carefully from start to finish, she never wastes a page, a word or a letter.<br /><br />This is a must for any of her fans or a good book to start with for people who don't know her works.<br /><br />I plan to find the rest to see how well the saga went!	2004-08-18

The novel is Gary Gygax trying to explain who Gord the Rogue is by showing you his early childhood and the events that happen about him, some of which are behind the scenes.  The deeper you get into it the more details, some very vague details about other characters and other events, are tossed at you.  The book is not the first in the series and you should not read it till either you are finished or almost finished with both the Greyhawk Adventures series and the Gord The Rogue series (which seems to be a spin off).	2004-08-15

The book is the edited work of 26 writers, teachers and editors.  The chapters are small, the details slim, the subjects bounce all over the place, and many of the rules and advice could be used by mystery or military writers.  It was just too weak, telling me nothing that I couldn't guess at.  If you want a solid piece of work about sci-fi/fantasy get the how-to-write books by Orson Scott Card.  If you want just fantasy there are world building books by Gary Gygax.  And if you want to learn about horror go to Stephen King.

Molin Torchholder, survivor of wars, magic battles and all the dangers of the city itself, has killers on his tail.  Good ones.  With the help of the cursing Cauvin, the son of a stoneyard owner, and Cauvin's younger bother, Bec, Molin MIGHT be able to protect Sanctuary before he dies.  But it'll be a close one.<br /><br />I took away a few stars for many reasons.  Cauvin cusses too frogging much, seems a tad too slow and, in a character driven plot line, it just seemed the author used his slowness to add a few hundred extra pages.  The book is 533 pages long and much of it is Cauvin trying to think of what to do when not cussing his bad luck.<br /><br />Also, there was a lot of information about the past - we learn about the Hand, but also about events that happened in the first books.  A lot of names are dropped - Tempus, Jubal, Kadakithis and even Hakiem - which fans, old or new, may enjoy.  But all these scenes seemed more like a data dump to me and slowed the action, what little there was, down.  The story didn't even really start to move till the last few chapters.<br /><br />It can't be helped - a story needs a starting point, a foundation.  You have to cook the meal before you eat it.  After all, this is the first book of the return to the world of 'Thieves' World' and I would suggest reading this one first.  But it is still long, slightly boring in some parts and throws a lot of both old history and not-so-old history at you.<br /><br />For fans it is a must, but once done I doubt you'll wish to re-read.	2004-08-03

The first book in this series is a refreshing splash of positive thinking.  The themes of magical regions beyond our limited senses, of never giving up, and of exploring ourselves and our future, are very strong, sometimes overwhelming the logic of real space and time, while sometimes seeming to crush the logic of the very plot itself.<br /><br />Everything is here - dangerous dragons, invisiblitiy cloaks, owls, flying brooms, bubbling cauldrons, magic potions, ghosts, evil family members and lost parents.<br /><br />This is the candy, the pop corn, the comfort food of the mind.  Good for children and adults alike, it is something you just pick up, sit down and read in front of a warm fire, while drinking tea and stroking the cat in your lap.  The characters are as bright as falling stars, the action swift as a roaring river and the words as delightful to the tongue as cotton candy.<br /><br />This is only the FIRST course in a meal that J.K. Rowling is still setting out for the readers, her guests to her lovely party, and the lightest of the fare.  The books will become heavier, darker, more filling as you go along, but with this one just enjoy it.  THIS is the salad - light, designed to prepare your palate for the rest of the meal.<br /><br />ENJOY!	2004-07-27

His sisters DON'T want her to do so, as they all have good names they don't wish to be splashed through the mud of a very public, and very ugly, court battle. They want him to either stop the wife, break this will, find another will or maybe even get the 'OTHER WOMAN' to cough up some of the millions she will get.<br /><br /> Right when it looks like Wolfe will just dismiss it all with a 'Pfui!' the police show up.

Can Peter Alander figure out what to do?  Can he help humanity, made up of people who look at him as nothing more then a flawed program, or will he end up failing it?<br />I enjoyed the novel very much and really found the idea that most of the characters are not even living beings, if defined by our standards, to be a nice touch.	2004-07-10

Then there is Tomo-Chan, the very loud girl who wants to beat Chiyo at, well, anything, and Sakaki, the cool, well developed, girl who happens to like animals.  There's also Yomi, the smart girl with glasses, and Kaorin, who has dreams about Chiyo's ponytails and seems to have a crush on Sakaki.  Then there are the teachers, none of which are normal.  With over 160 pages you get A LOT of stuff.  There are two four-panel scenes on EACH page and, whether they are part of a story or a stand alone scene, they are funny without getting heavy or too emotional.  They're cute.  The cats seem to have issues, but most of the book is VERY cute.<br />The book's cover says it's for 13 and up, which is true.  At one point the girls are talking about their bodies, so it is really for young adults.  The cover also says it is an \\"Action/Comedy\\" manga but as there is very little in the way of car chases and gun battles I would ignore the \\"Action\\" and just take it as a \\"Comedy\\".	2004-07-09

Not only does the book point out the mistakes, but all the ways to get around them.  Jack M. Bickham doesn't tell you, &quot;This is the wrong way,&quot; without also saying, &quot;But this is how to fix it&quot;.<br />He is also honest - he won't tell you that it's easy or simple to do.

Well, their problem is that they're not alone - Miyabi-san is there to act as a chaperone.  Soon Tina, an American-born Japanese-raised college student, has moved into also, believing that Aoi is just the landlady and Kaoru is just renting a room.<br />Taeko soon joins them (having been fired from her other job) and is soon both cleaning and breaking up the house.  In other words the boarding house idea back-fires.<br />Will the couple EVER get together?  When will the families allow them to marry?  Can you have TOO many nude scenes in bath houses?<br />This volume seems to cover a lot of ground and a fan of the anime will notice it seems much shorter than the DVDs. Much of the plot elements are spread out over many of the anime's episodes, DVD 2,3&amp; 4, in fact.  This is because the anime came AFTER the manga, so the TV series added fillers that ADDED to the plot without slowing it down.<br />The manga is for 16 and up, being a tad more mature in both scenes and humor than the anime, and a fan of the anime would enjoy the slight difference in the details.<br />I plan to get the third volume, yes I DO!	2004-07-01

When the plot is totally character-driven, this makes it easy to see where things are going, even with the most surprising plot-twists.

They're even willing to go to war for him.<br />Somebody better do something fast, before the Dream is lost and civilization is lost with it!	2004-06-25

After volume One and Two we now know that Hinata Asahi, because of her rich father, has been kidnapped many times.  We know that she has somehow stayed happy, even after she decided that living alone was better.  She didn't want anybody else getting hurt if somebody kidnapped her again.  And by the third volume you SHOULD know why Shiro Asou is there.<br />But can you guess who is going to be her next kidnapper?  Will Shiro be able to protect her and will Hinata WANT his protection when he could hurt?  And what happens when SHE figures out that he's just doing a job for her father?  If she loves him because he does everything she loves, what happens when she understands that he did it to get close to her, to better protect her?<br />And can he love her back?	2004-06-25

Three murders to solve, two meals, a taxi cab with a lady driver who isn't its owner and lots of cowfolk.  The stories are all delightful to a Nero Wolfe fan and are all linked by a very rare event.  In each story Mr. Wolfe leaves his house!  True, sometimes there was a good meal involved, but it is still rare to see him outside his brownstone.  He has also been known to leave it because of flower related affairs, but you know how he hates cars, thinks they're death traps.  And he might be right.<br />Anyway, if you are a fan, buy it.  If you're not a fan, buy it anyway.  Get three stories for the price of one and become a fan of the greatest detective of all time!	2004-06-22

Onegai Twins! is the story of a boy and his sister and a complete stranger.  Maiku Kamishiro has found the home his family use to live in.  He was orphaned at a early age and only has a photo to link him to his youth, a photo that shows him with his sister.<br />Soon his life will be turned upside down as two girls show up at his family home, each with the same photo, each one assuming that THEY were his sister.<br />The book is funny, has mature humor, but not as interesting as the novel based on Onegai Teacher!  It may be because the DVDs are not yet available and I have no foundation to base the characters on.  Luckily this novel starts off at the beginning of the story, so I'm not missing too much.  There are also some old characters from the Teacher! episodes, but they have a few new ones also.<br />But there are weird flaws.  For example, one chapter is called &quot;The Pinky Pledge&quot; but nothing like that HAPPENS in the chapter OR the whole book.  So I am missing SOMETHING.<br />Either way it does make me want to watch the anime when it becomes available for me to buy.  This is great for people who are already fans, but like the Teacher! series not for young readers.  Remember, this is a text novel NOT a manga or graphic novel.	2004-06-18

In this first volume they run into Bonnie and Clyde, a sister-brother team of hired guns, the most dangerous killers working for the mob in Chicago.  A couple of one chapter stories plus a interview with Kenichi Sonoda at the start makes for interesting 'extras' in this volume.<br />Because of the blood and some scenes in a brothel this is not for kids.

Based on the true story of an Indian girl who lived alone for years on the island of San Nicolas, the last woman of her tribe.  The story of Karana's life on the Island of the Blue Dolphins is therefore special, because it is based on real life.  We watch as Karana's life goes from bad to worse, as watching everybody she loves either leaving her or being killed, by men or beasts.  Soon she is all alone, on the island, with wild dogs, playful otters and lots of sea birds.  She must not only find food, keep herself warm and protect herself aginst the wild animals, but she must also find a way to fight her loneiless.  A story about survival of both body and mind.<br />Sometimes it is hard to believe.  The author tells us in one chapter how Karana makes a bow and arrows to go with the bow, while in another chapter we are told how hard it is to find ANY wood.  Yet a good story for young and old.	2004-06-08

A ship full of survivors, or fools, end up on one of the islands of the Galapagos Islands.  The plot seems to be a series of accidents, random events and luck (good or bad).  Which could all be the same thing just with different names, but allows the reader to see a brave new world being built by nature's laws.  Kind of funny.  This is my first book by Kurt Vonnegut but while I am impressed by the way he hooked me in with the interesting idea of having a ghost tell us the story I'm not going to run out and buy all his books.  This book was funny and interesting, but I'm not going to be rereading it each and every year.<br />If you like this author, are interested in evolution or the future of mankind then buy this book.	2004-06-03

The hero of this book is flawed, committed to his work and loved, yet in some ways very selfish, very human.  When he finds out he has leukemia he spends half the book to develop the technology and methods to freeze humans so they can be revived later.  He is placed into this cold sleep and wakes up in 1991.<br />The rest of the book is the exploration of the future (from the author's point of view).  Things HAVE changed.  Something like the internet, a system of two-way televisions linked to libraries, has been invented. Scientists try to cure murders with drugs and dream therapy based on the idea that people who carry out crimes are just sick or insane. They are not punished.  A lot of machines have been made to make life simpler and Japan even made a thinking machine.<br />The future, at least in this book, feels slightly uncomfortable.  Even the hero feels that some things are wrong even when everybody is telling him things are better.<br />Of course Communism and Socialism has spread through-out the world, forcing Capitalism to withdraw to a few nations.  Yet, once again, the author doesn't show us a paradise.  He shows us a Earth still working to improve itself, step by step.  As troubled and as hopeful as the main character is.<br />Humans are still humans, seems to be the main theme, even while working to make themselves perfect.  Maybe the fact that we are always changing, trying to reach those ideals, is what makes us human?  Immortality is a strong theme, but there seems to be a question on whether it is good for mankind or bad for mankind.<br />Worth reading once, but don't go out of your way to get it.	2004-05-29

'Star Maker' by Olaf Stapledon is more about philosophy than about science fiction, but it has enough of both to make all kinds of fans happy.  The author covers the history of, well, almost everything.  He travels through space and time, back and forth, to explore everything from intelligent stars to the alien civilizations that rise ands fall, from simple plant-men to massive utopias.  Always, he is also looking for the Star Maker, God, the Great Creator.<br />He even links this book to his first novel, 'Last And First Man', by talking about some periods in mankind's history, like the war with Mars.  This book is all about scale.  Yet while I enjoyed this book it didn't feel as well planned, as detailed as 'Last And First Man'.  But I'm not sure a book of 272 pages could be said to be lacking in details.  Its scope is vast and giving too many details might of limited it, framed it into too small a canvas.  Olaf is using wide strokes of his huge brush to build this story.<br />With a forword by Brain Aldiss and a interesting glossary, I would suggest this book for both sci-fi fans, people looking for God in what seems like a godless universe and also people who just enjoy philosophy.	2004-05-26

If you want a solid, detailed book about the search for mankind's origins this is it.  The first part of the book deals with the science of paleoanthropology, the nuts and bolts of how it works, from dating fossils, firepits and artifacts to studying past climates.  The book also reveals to us the debates within society about where humans came from and what it means to be human.  Will the answers change the way we think about ourselves and how what we will do in the future?<br />The second part shows us the evidence - bones.  Skulls, teeth, fingers.  In clear photos, many of them actual size so we can see for ourselves what the text is telling us.  It ends with a couple of pages on stone tools and their development.<br />The two authors did their best to make the book complete BUT they also did not talk down to the reader.  They don't assume you know everything, but they don't assume you're a fossil hunter either.  For pros or beginners alike.	2004-05-22

Also accidents seem to happen around him no matter how much or how hard he tries to do his best.<br />So when a spaceship crashed on the moon, Fred found himself in a trap.  The people at the base had been given the ship's general location via the space station.  He KNEW the info was wrong and he also knew where the ship was, but the Moon base only had so many tractors or men to search with and they couldn't mess this up the first time.  They didn't have the time!<br />Now Fred had two ways to handle this.  He could obey orders and let two men die.

This book is amazing, reminding me slightly of 'Last And First Man' by Olaf Stapledon and also 'The Time Machine' by H.G. Wells.  It's not just a science fiction book, but a book about the human spirit, the human soul, the human mind.  Yes, it has aliens, and strange planets, and mankind's many different forms in the future, but at a certain point it goes beyond the hard science to explore our dreams and what the future may bring.  Love and death, waste and power, peace and war.  No matter what body we may create, no matter what mind we may think in, no matter how we evolve, we can't give up.  We may give up our forms and even link our minds, but in the end we are all searching for something that only WE need and only WE can understand.  Drake is after something that is special only to him.<br />Yes, there are a few weak ideas, like when future man turns to Drake for help, because thy don't know how to fight against an 'alien menace'.  Yet I found it funny, and even refreshing, because Drake was just as useless when it came to fighting a war as they were.  My only complaint is that after 387 pages the ending was also kind of weak.  I wanted something more, something solid.  Not a re-read, if you get my drift.  Check it out of the library or get a used copy.	2004-05-09

The rocket is full of equipment which was to run tests and then return to orbit.  The problem was that the rocket, designed to handle the high gravity, couldn't handle the gravity.  The humans are willing to do anything to get it back.<br />And in the end, they just might.  A great ending.<br />GREAT book.  I love the hard science, the cool alien race, the bonus article- &quot;Whirligig World&quot; - in which Hal Clement tells us how he came up with the amazing, fantastic planet and the life that lived on it.  Lots of humor.<br />Funny Note: I just reviewed the book, The Jupiter Theft, a few days ago.  In it the aliens are from the system of Cygnus.  That's the same binary system Mr. Clement was thinking about when he started to design the planet of Mesklin.<br />He did such a good job that the Mesklinites are in Barlowe's Guide To Extraterrestrials, Aliens And Alien Societies edited by Ben Bova, and Clifford Pickover's The Science Of Aliens.	2004-05-05

Extras include the fact files in the back, plus lots of scenes with the Puma sisters.  They're easy to make happy, just give them candy or food, and they can sleep anywhere.  Anna can even change her size (but I prefer her in her adult, shapely, size).  Uni, on the other hand, seems more serious about the job.	2004-05-04

His ideas become huge engineering projects, of such massive scope that it boggles the mind.  Using a whole gas planet as as fuel, taking it along and protecting your ships from the radiation by putting them behind a moon is something that NOBODY would of thought of before.  Yet by making it seem simple, if not also a tad ruthless, he makes the Cygnans seem totally alien.  The scope, the time, the very sweep of their plans and projects force the reader to see them as a totally alien culture.<br />In fact he did such a good job that Cygnans are in both Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials AND Clifford Pickover's The Science Of Aliens (along with a different artist's drawing of what a Cygnan looks like).  The science of planet stealing might be questionable, but the design of the aliens, their history and their ways, in the book is a first class example of how to do it RIGHT.	2004-05-03

He was just as smart, handsome and well liked.

Serious, funny, painful and so real it really seems to touch our memories of what school was REALLY like.<br />This volume also holds a stand-alone story, kind of the manga's extra you might say, called The Tiger and The Chameleon.  It is a VERY touching story all by itself.<br />It has been pointed out that the events in the anime ends at volume 8, but the manga goes on, so I plan to collect as many of the manga volumes as I can to see what's going to happen beyond the anime's ending.

Clarke and even a chapter on his visit to Grovers Mill where the people were friendly and didn't seem mad at him at all.<br />Also the author uses fascinating data from 'The Invasion From Mars' by Hadley Cantril, a study of the psychology of panic, to help explain WHY the events unfolded as they did.

Stephen Baxter gives us a epic tale, to show mankind where it came from and where it might be going.  Starting over 65 million years ago he paints us a picture of our evolution, making sure to detail each and ever major point along the pathway where earlier primates had to make a choice.  As he follows our DNA, from tiny primates, to tree-climbing apes, to tool making hominids and finally to early man, he shows us what problems we faced, how we solved them and how that shaped our body and mind.<br />By doing so he also shows, with no forgiveness or pity, just how dangerous and ruthless we could be, even before we invented atomic bombs and machine guns.  Soon we're are in the year 2031 and people realize that we need to change.  NOW, not in a couple years, not in a few decades, but RIGHT NOW.<br />After 2031 humans continue to evlove, along side fast breeding rats, jumping rabbits, flexible pigs, hungry goats, some developing new ways of life or returning to old designs that have tested true over the millions of years.  But all the animals and plants are fighting for their rightful place on the aging Earth.  The latter part of the book is in fact very much like a mixture of Dougal Dixon's two books, &quot;Man After Man&quot; and &quot;After Man&quot;, where complex relationships form between the new animals and plants, sometimes more complex than just the simple predator and prey relationships.  Even mankind splits up into different forms, some which work better than others.<br />The book is based on rock hard science, with fantastic ideas of the author's own mixed in.  It is sometimes funny, sometimes tragic and always imaginative.<br />Yet it is also a warning.  We might already be too late to change ANYTHING.	2004-04-24

The problem is that they don't really understand what humans wanted.

But do you remember the Thrint from 'World of Ptavvs', the Cinruss from 'Hospital Station', or the Cygnan from 'The Jupiter Theft'?<br />A great source of information on alien races with full color pictures, lots of data on history, culture and habitat BUT also a great source for finding classic stories you never heard of!<br />Do you know the Pnume, Salaman, Triped or Merseian?

These stories help us to understand how Sector General came about and allow us to see where the main characters of Conway and O'Mara came from.  It also allows the reader to get use to how the hospital deals with everyday problems, ill aliens and special VIPs.<br />The next two books are full length novels, one about war and the other is about one of the biggest patients you'll ever read about.

While the plot is a solid one, dealing with subjects and issues that I found interesting, the delivery is bad.  The characters are stereotypes, the setting - in the middle of the 21 century, seems no different from now.  The author just adds a few things, like colonies on Mars and a few space stations.<br />As you read the book you might notice things are missing.  Like names.  What is the name of the university where some of the main characters work?  What state is State Senator from?  What is the name of the space station turned starship?  What party does the President belong to?  These tiny details are the spice of any story that helps develop it, give it background. Without them a story can be good, but not great.  And this story needed them, because it was not good.  Like a steak on the grill, sometimes you need something to go with it.<br />If you want something easy, get this book.

I just happened to read the book that follows this one, so for me, to read this book was to go backards in time, to see how Giraut and Margaret first met, to see his home world and her home world first hand, to see the merits and flaws of both characters and cultures and maybe gain more understanding of the universe John Barnes has designed.  The book brings out the wonder and fear of contact, not between alien races, but human cultures.  While the novel was published in 1992, it is very much a valid warning for today's readers.  The world is much smaller than before, we can't stop that, but maybe we can limit the damage to ourselves, to our culture and to our souls.<br />As for the story, once again, it was a wonderful ride.  Seeming to go one way, it jerks off the rails and goes another, as if the very characters and the world in which Mr. Barnes has created had a life of its own.  A surprise ending, yes, but also a realistic and even sad one.	2004-03-21

North America, more than 10,000 years ago, was a very interesting place.  Gaint ground sloths, dwarf wolly mommoths, Nebrasks camels (weighing about a ton) and saber-toothed cats are just some of the bizarre animals you will find within the covers of this book.  Ice Age Mammals of North America tries to give you a very balanced look at not just the big and hairy, but the more common creatures.  Lions, wolves, bears, seals, porcupines, goats, beavers and deer to name just a few.<br />The book begins with what North America was like, why we think ice ages are triggered, goes into detail about the many different animals (which takes up much of the book) and then tells us about the extinction of the megamammals (plus the debates about WHY extinctions happen at all).<br />There are lots of photos and colorful illustrations, sidebars full of fact, lots of humor, a list of museums, fossil sites and websites you can visit.  It also has a detailed glossary, bibliography and index.  Great for adults and kids.<br />Ian M. Lange really enjoyed doing this work, you can tell, and Dorothy S. Norton's work really helped bring many of the animals to life.	2004-03-18

Alien yet familiar, with real characters, full of plans, fears, merits and flaws.  Who is the puppet and who is the master, becomes just one of the questions that starts to form in the mind while reading this book.  This is a work, not just of the pen, but of a highly skilled mind, crafted carefully with the tools of the English language and with love of the science fiction setting itself.  Plots within plots within plots, in a universe so will formed, with characters so well designed, with events so well timed, that you won't know what's going to really happen till the last page.<br />And he has more books out there!	2004-03-15

The idea is simple: a student, name of Hitoshi Kobe, likes making artifical intelligences (which is the only thing he is good at).  Well, one day one of his programs, in fact the best program of the whole lot, becomes real.  So, if you love robots or androids, this is not the manga for you.  Think more 'Oh My Goddess', but without the good stories.<br />I can't really compare this work to the 'Love Hina' manga, as I collect the anime, but when compared to other manga, it doesn't cut it.  It does have extras and interesting Q&amp;A areas, where the creator, Ken Akamatsu, answers questions about art and girls.  Yet, that just isn't enough - maybe it just didn't age well or looks bad when compared to newer manga (not that it is really old).  Think watered-down.<br />If you are a fan of the creator or can find it cheap, try it.  But don't waste your money on it if you don't have to.	2004-03-05

But once beyond the recap we soon get into new territory.  The chapters seem to be set between episodes of the anime (or other chapters of the manga) and help fill out the characters of the show, including the secondary ones.<br />The last few chapters deal with adult material, so I'm not sure that it is fit for even 15 year olds.  On the other hand, I knew much of this stuff by the time I was 12.<br />The only problem I have is the book needed more proofreading.  Not that there are spelling or grammar mistakes, as much as sentences in the wrong places and things like 'someo f' instead of 'some of'.  A good computer or a couple of beta readers could of caught much of the typos.<br />But if you already have the fanbook, the anime and the manga, this is a must.  For 15 and up.	2004-02-23

The main character is a tank-loving Leona Ozaki,a police mini-tank commander, who seems to be fighting a one-woman war against crime, which in most cases means she is dealing with Buaku, a master criminal, and his two catgirl thugs, the Puma sisters (who make an appearance in Ghost in the Shell).<br />The fact is, that Buaku has more than just gold coins on his mind.  In fact, the future of planet Earth, and the human race, hangs in the balance.  Can the tank police stop him or will he get away with more than just cash?<br />Great book.  Has extras, like character files and even a small chapter on min-tanks.  Also includes an extra story - Phantom of the Audience.

From the first tool using hominids to the first civilizations, we get a complete yet easy to understand history in about 156 pages.  The book hits all the major points, from the first hominids to walk only on two legs, to the Neanderthals, the development of Cro-Magnons and beyond.  Once we get to Modern Man the book dives into stone tool development, the use of DNA to trace our family tree and the spread of man throughout the world.  Yet it is careful to define every term or explain every theory that pops up.  From there we follow mankind as they go from hunter-gathers to early farmers, from tribes to chiefdoms and, finally, from city-states to the first civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus valley.<br />The book gives the reader LOTS of information in the form of great photos, maps, timelines and graphs, all designed to make the text easier to follow. Nice hardcover book about early man for history beginners or kids.  Slightly outdated, but most of the facts are still valid.	2004-01-21

What makes me say that?  Could it be that the sins are too vague or too outdated?  No, I judged this book based on my enjoyment or lack of enjoyment in reading it.  Wit without substance, characters without passion, dialogue without reason.  I found myself reading other books just so I had an excuse not to continue reading this one.  In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me.  177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'.  The only reason I finished was because I hate to start a book then walk away and also I wanted to do review (and to do a review without finishing the book is unfair).	2004-01-21

This book is, in fact, ten booklets printed together making ten chapters.  Each chapter deals in detail with a certain subject, for example the first is called 'Brain Tan Buckskin' while the second is 'Primitive Fire &amp; Cordage' and so on.  Each chapter shows skills and gives knowledge that will help with the next few.  For example, knowing how to make cordage helps with making bows, setting traps and making baskets.  This knowledge can be helpful or just thought provoking.<br />I really enjoyed this book because of my interest not only in Native American culture but also in the Neanderthals, early man and the Ice Age. Mr. McPherson not only talks about how to do something, but deals with the materials available, how the weapons and tools work and even gives you information on other methods of doing the same thing.  But what he shows you in the book works because HE HAS DONE IT.<br />I don't suggest giving it to young kids - Mr. McPherson makes it so easy to start fires and set traps.  Hehe!

Between the covers of this book are plans for atomic powered cars, tanks, and bombers, the promises found within hobby magazines, chapters on the movies and radio shows that showed us the future, the designs for bomb proof cities and homes, hopes for the flying car, the idea for death rays, flying tanks and much, much more.<br />Having been first published in 1984 it even hints at what visions we still believed in that would appear in our future, from the space shuttle to real laser weapons.  Kind of fun but also kind of sad.	2004-01-16

Brought to you by the people you gave you Supertanks, Body Armor: 2000 and Space Dreadnoughts, a book of short stories which focus on mankind's greatest dream and nightmare - fighting machines. All the classics are here, from Fred Saberhagen's \\"Smasher\\" to Keith Laumer's \\"A Relic Of War\\".  Other authors such as Poul Anderson, Philip K. Dick and Gordon R. Dickson add their stories to the mix.<br />While the stories are all pre-1991, this book is a must for any sci-fi fan or robot fan.	2004-01-14

The book is very detailed and very interesting, but while it has lots of information about Neanderthals, and they are an important part of the book, much of it IS about the subtitle, In Search of the First Thinkers.  When did we go from gestures to language?  When did we stop making the same stone tool, again and again, and start making different tools for different needs?  When did we stop thinking about how to hunt down an animal which was right in front of us and start planning out how to get food in the future?  The author uses Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons to ask 'Why did one win over the other?'  Was it language?  What does art have to do with it? Maybe it had to do with the development of better tools?  And what do bigger brains have to do with it if Neanderthals had the biggest ones?<br />It is as much history as it is philosophy.	2004-01-13

This second novel in the series opens with the Dark Ones launching a missile with nuclear warheads against the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  Once again we have a great book full of action, adventure, high tech weapons and past mysteries.  Inside the book we follow TWO plot lines, one set in 999 AD and the other set in our own time.  Vikings, nuclear powered subs and underwater pyramids are just SOME of the things you'll find within the covers of this great book.<br />Military thriller mixed with ancient civilizations and a evil alien race trying to destroy us.

The incomplete story, 'Hornblower During The Crisis' seems to be set just after 'Hornblower And The Hotspur'.  The story was never finished and the ONE page of notes at the end DO tell you how the story turns out but doesn't have much in the way of details.  It would of been nice to see a dozen pages or so of the author's notes.<br />The next two stories, 'Hornblower's Temptation'(which seems to be set after 'Lieutenant Hornblower') and 'The Last Encounter', which is the very last tale about him, are both short but complete.  They show us a very interesting view of Hornblower's inner thought process when he was young and when he gets old.<br />So in a way it does end the series, but also shows him during earlier periods of his life.	2004-01-06

And some of the League won't live to see victory!<br />Realistic artwork and a gritty story, in which nothing is Black or White, but a shade of Gray as Mr. Bond and Mr. Mycroft Holmes try to win against heat rays, giant tripods and impossible odds.<br />Like Volume One Vulome Two has extras in the back.  But instead of a story there is a Almanac, full of information about the world, from such great explorers as Gulliver, Nemo, Miss Wilhelmina Murry, the Duke of Milan, and even some reports from Orlando, Sindbad and G.E. Challenger.  Through these characters and their travels we visit the Black Lagoon, Utopia, Arkham, Laputa, Lilliput, Shangri-La, Xanadu, Toyland and even the Mountains Of Madness.  We meet, or learn about, Goldfinger, Dr. Dolittle, Gene Autry, the &quot;Deep Ones&quot;, Captain Hook and even Alice (from Wonderland).  There are so many facts that it would take a review many times longer just to list them.  Rich cities, haunted ruins, weird races and underground mysteries are all part of this world.  The total collection of man's fears, loves and dreams.<br />You HAVE to buy it.  Be careful, to my knowledge the soft-cover is not available yet (at the time this was made anyway).	2003-12-27

Mr. Gould is an honest writer, brave enough to say that what he says might be proven wrong later on, but is willing to dive right in anyway.  He is willing to get his hands messy while trying to work out the paleontological puzzle of the Burgess Shale and he takes us along, we go together during every step, we watch scientists overcome every barrier and we are able to judge the results that we saw built right before our eyes, piece by piece.<br />Great read.	2003-12-27

We follow Captain Nemo, and his Nautilus - a sub that runs on batteries, in his travels around the oceans of the Earth.  We follow him as he explores underwater forests, goes hunting dangerous sea monsters, takes from the sea what he and his men need to live, visits the South Pole and even shows us Atlantis.<br />The problem is that about one third of the book is Jules Verne explaining EVERY tiny detail, from the family trees of fish and other sea creatures, to page after page on how the Nautilus works. The fight with the school of squid is only a few pages long.<br />On the other hand, Nemo is not shown as a man trying to force mankind to improve as much as he is trying to live without contact with it (even when he helps some parts of it to fight back by giving rebels gold he finds on the seafloor).  In the end, it is mankind who forces him to fight back, by hunting him down with warships.<br />My book had an introduction by Ray Bradbury, which was very interesting, but did little to help the story itself.<br />A good book for fans of Jules Verne, classic adventure stories and anybody interested in the sea.	2003-12-23

Jonathan Margolis starts out by finding out what past people thought the future would be like, if they got it right or wrong and WHY they got it right or wrong.  After looking at the works of authors, such as H.G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, Jules Verne and Edward Bellamy, plus scientists, professors and specialists he dives into what people believe now.  Chapter after chapter deals with global warming, ice ages, pollution, advanced medicine, genetic engineering, the internet, robots, e-commerce, smart kitchens, cloning, politics, space travel, flying cars, airships, teleportation, time travel AND aliens.<br />Then he lists his own ideas about future trends, some of which seem bland, others seem to be very reasonable, and some seem weird.  For example, he suggests global warming might just fade away (which it might), 'Real' or 'Natural' will always be valued over 'virtual' (and I'm sure it will cost more), that aircars would be dangerous within the city streetscape(true), and that we don't have to worry about things like asteroid impacts (just because he figures it will happen to a part of the Earth that nobody cares about).<br />But the whole book is about the fact that futurology can be bland, reasonable and weird all at the same time.  Don't take him seriously, but enjoy the book.  Great for science fiction fans or want-to-be authors of science fiction!<br />Go airships!	2003-12-22

Lets get to the facts - this book is large and filled with details about vampires in history, legends, movies and books.  It talks about vampire fashion and lifestyles, TV shows, research into vapirism, vampire relationships with witches, werewolves and ghouls, vampires from around the world and much, much more!<br />It deals not just with Dracula (and his many spin offs) and Anne Rice, but the World Of Darkness, Dark Shadows and Forever Knight.  It has a great index for a quick search and appendixs that list the &quot;main&quot; characters, help define terms and list nonfiction books.<br />But while published in 2002 it is already outdated.  It talks about Buffy's death and the switching of networks (old news).  Also, while you can find vampire authors such as P.N. Elrod, Lois Tilton, Richard Matheson and John Steakley, how about Kim Newman, Tanya Huff, Susan Sizemore, Laurell K. Hamilton, and Christopher Golden?<br />I don't think I'll worry about it as I'm sure new editions will be updated to cover them.<br />Don't forget to add Kerri Hawkins!	2003-12-20

This ia a great book, for science fiction fans or just people interested in future forecasting of the 20th century.  The book deals with the ideas, serious or not, of what past artists, scientists and writers thought the future would look like.  Cities, cars, airships, rockets, monorails fill the pages of this book, with text which guides you on your tour of the 'future'.  Some designs like the floating airports, the car/boat and the monorail HAVE changed reality (for some of us),while other ideas, like the six mile high tower, are not yet available.<br />My problem, my ONLY problem, with the book is how small it is.  At 96 pages it barely covers anything.  The chapter on robots is only TWO pages long and only has TWO illustrations. I noticed only ONE underwater city and some drawings, like a few pages on the 'Future City' have no text at all.<br />Still, it is a great gift for sci-fi fans, future engineers or fans of the cartoon series &quot;Futurama&quot;.	2003-12-20

First, before anything else, he links us to a character, a man named Bert Smallways, who we will follow and this allows us to see what is happening from the view of a normal man within the book.  The first few chapters in fact deal only with Bert, pushing much of the major events into the background, suggested by news headlines that nobody seems to notice.<br />But when wars come it comes with a bam.  The Earth's weapons seem to be bomb carrying airships and gun carrying airplanes.<br />The airships seem to be the major weapon, becoming the terrors of the sky, huge monster craft that carry death to the cities of Earth.<br />Why airships?  The book was published in 1907.  While airplanes were just being invented and designs played with, blimps and dirigibles were already flying about in good numbers.  By the time World War One cames about, German airships are bombing London.  Airplanes started off during the Great War totally unarmed, used for scouting out enemy movements and checking out the landscape.  So, for him to suggest that airships would become the wave of the future in combat is not a great leap of logic.<br />One scene has German airplanes and airships destroying an American fleet of warships, a chilling vision of things to come.<br />As each nation designs and builds it own aircraft things get out of hand.  While the air fleets can bomb the cities, they can't TAKE them (not being able to carry any troops) and they can't DEFEND them (as they carry many bombs, but few weapons to fight other aircraft), so soon the world is nothing but burnt out buildings and thousands of airships attacking anything on the ground that even LOOKS dangerous.<br />Will Bert survive?  Will he get back to England?  Will mankind ever learn to live together?	2003-12-19

After a small, but very detailed history of warfare Mr. David Langford dives right into the military technology of the future, the many ideas from science fiction and if they would really work.  He looks at lasers and other energy weapons, nuclear wars, missiles and space weapons, biological and chemical weapons, fuel air explosives, space stations and spaceships, mass drivers and wars between planets (and even solar systems).  He even talks about black holes and knocking planets into the sun!<br />He not only examines how something might or might not work, but how much it might cost.  Even if it could work, would we want to pay the funds, the man hours or the energy to build or work such a weapon?  And what happens when we start running into aliens?  I think a lot of later science authors took some of his ideas too.<br />Great for fans of science fiction, future studies or military studies.  He even asks if we can live with some of the choices that we might be forced to make!	2003-12-16

The 'Strange Case Of Dr. Jerkyll And Mr. Hyde' by Robert Louis Stevenson, the same author to bring us 'Treasure Island' and 'Kidnapped', seems to be a basic good vs. evil within the soul of man.  Yet Dr. Jerkyll's problems dealing with the evil within turns out LESS than basic.  In fact, while Jerkyll fights the evil it seems to grow, becoming stronger.  Near the end Mr. Hyde is not only larger than before but seems to be able to appear at will.  Yet this is not a DIFFERENT person, both men are the same, sharing the same desires.<br />Within each of us is a Hyde who wants to strike out, to crush those who hurt us or make fun of us.  Why else would we love all those action flicks?<br />This is a timeless theme and something everybody has to deal with.	2003-12-12

Ants in South America has always been part of the landscape, from leaf-cutter ants to army ants, they are part of daily life.  But what happens when the ants come and refuse to leave?<br />Other stories in this tiny collection are 'The Man Who Could Work Miracles' which was also a movie, 'The Country Of The Blind' which proves that sight is NOT an advantage, 'The Crystal Egg' which is a must for any War of the Worlds' fan and 'The Magic Shop', a very weird short story.<br />A must for any fan of H.G.

Well, the flying saucer is not a real saucer, but a device used by Rudy Rucker to allow us to see the future through the eyes of a character, Frank Shook, who travels through time with the aliens.  We learn about how things will change, or how Rudy THINKS things will change, in the future.  He writes about transhumanity, alien races, faster-than-light space travel, time travel, cloning, future forms of communication, energy sources, farming, organic houses, hardware, software and even wetware.  All of it becomes, like much of what we discover, a cause and effect series of events, as one idea brings about another.  Not as serious as Wells' 'A Story of The Days to Come' or as detailed as Stapledon's 'Last And First Men' it IS funny, interesting and will make you think.	2003-12-03

I happen to be a fan of Wells' 'War of the Worlds' and also a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  The book tries to explain some loose ends from the 'War of the Worlds' story and suggests some interesting ideas, like the Martians might be the result of a breeding problem or that they brought the red weed to Earth to 'terraform' it. Yet most of the time our Heros are running for their lives.  They can do nothing but wait for the invaders to die and do very little to fight off the alien invaders (who might not even be from Mars).<br />Also, I found the idea that Sherlock Holmes was able to STOP using drugs and STOP hating women at the same time to be slightly unbelievable.<br />I would suggest it for fans of H.G. Wells or fans of Sherlock Holmes.  Enjoy it.	2003-11-25

Yes, the book is one of the best science-fiction stories H.G. Wells wrote, it is very detailed, with very well formed characters, seems believable (if you don't get too nitpicky) and even the Invisible Man seems interesting to the reader, being smart, yet slightly mad and even unhappy with his new discovery.<br />But let us not forget the humor within the pages - the reactions of the common masses, the problems the Invisible Man has with just dealing with every day life and the fact that he seems to have more problems being invisible than he ever did being visible.	2003-11-23

This book by Dougal Dixon asks, 'What would the Earth be like if dinosaurs had not kicked the bucket?'  The first chapters deal with evolution in general and with real dinosaurs, where they came from, how they changed and why they might have died out. This is followed by chapters that deal with the different regions of Earth, how they have changed over the millions of years and what the animals are like.  Not just dinosaurs either, but also creatures evolved from birds, pterosaurs, sea-reptiles and other animals.  As in 'After Man' the whole book has been designed like a non-fiction text book, or a nature guide, but doesn't seem as detailed or as fun.  While Dixon's 'The New Dinosaurs' seems slightly more realistic than 'After Man' which had such weird creatures as parashrews, it also seems to have less imagination.	2003-11-22

With the help of his girlfriend and her co-workers.<br />Great artwork and its wonderful to see a whole comic book in full color.  Just splashes of color all over the pages!  While the book looks very slim it holds one full story and has lots of background, details and characters.<br />The only problem I had with this book is the way the binding used up part of the page to attach the pages together.  In other words, some sentences and part of the artwork was trapped in the fold and can't be seen.  Bummer.	2003-11-12

First is 'The Picture in the House' a very short, short story.  This is followed by 'Herbert West - Reanimator' which was written for a humor magazine so is broken down into six parts.  Then we have 'The Hound', 'The Shunned House'(giant elbows - NOOO!), 'The Horror at Red Hook', 'Cool Air', 'The Call of Cthulhu'(a major thread in the myths), 'Pickman's Model', 'The Thing on the Doorstep'(linked to a few stories by its very setting and characters) and 'The Haunter of the Dark'. These latter stories are very common to Lovecraft collections, so you should already know them.  'Herbert West - Reanimator' is not as easy to find and is the main reason I got this copy.<br />The book DOES have one interesting feature, which is all the information they add.  Still, if I wanted to know so much about Lovecraft I would of bought a book about HIM.  Also, the notes sometimes get in the way of the story.  I suggest reading the stories and ignoring the notes the first time around.  There are also nice photos of places that Lovecraft lived at or used within his stories.	2003-11-08

Having two mystery novels of Seicho Matsumoto I had to get this book of short stories and I am very happy I did.  Set in Japan, during the 50s and 60s, the stories are about unsolved crimes, 6 crimes which we, as the readers, follow along with the main characters, be they murders, bystanders or police.  I really enjoy the feel of Matsumoto's Japan, a Japan still trying to find itself in a Post-World War Two/Cold War world, a mixture of train schedules, rare if modern phones, old fashion kimonos and tea.<br />I also enjoy the details he pours into each story.  He gives you all the facts - he doesn't cheat and rarely tosses in come clue in the last sentence.  I wish more of his work was in English!	2003-11-07

The best books about other cultures are those that start at the bottom and work up.  In this book Elisabeth Bumiller interviews a Japanese women and her family, friends and others linked to the family to give a very detailed picture of a Japanese family from 1991 to 1992.  We get to join festivals, sit in at PTA meetings, visit mobsters, learn about local politics, find out what family issues the Japanese have and even the family's view on America and international events.<br />NOTE: The author has very strong views of her own and will state them, but don't let that get in the way of the rest of the book.  She digs up a LOT of information and makes it clear that while the Japanese might have different ways of thinking or doing stuff, they do have some of the same goals, dreams and fears.	2003-11-05

The story 'I AM LEGEND' is a must for any vampire library and is the story used to make the film, 'The Last Man On Earth'.  It is dark, tragic and enjoyable to read.  Robert Neville is as close to a real person that a fictional character can get, a person trapped between the logic of his mind and the new dark age that has fallen outside his house, a new age of vampires.  This story ALONE is a great reason for buying this book, but wait, there's more.  10 other stories within its covers will delight and entertain you.  In fact, as most of them have been on TV(or the big screen) in one form or the other, they already have.<br />Richard Matheson is one of the major sources for many horror stories dealing with the undead, having influenced such authors as Stephen King and 'I AM LEGEND' is one of the many books that inspired the creation of 'Vampire: The Masquerade'.<br />Even the cover of the book I have, is cool, good artwork, so why not buy it?	2003-11-01

First off, let me say that the author gives a very honest and emotional picture of ONE Japanese valley.  The fact is that Japan's ideals and norms can't be judged by the study of one village OR two villages OR three villages.  Also, the characters are, in some cases, composites of more than one person, names have been changed and so on, but the events DID happen.<br />After saying all that I have to state that this is a great book.  It is full of humor, passion, happy interaction and tragic events.  And, yes, lots of drinking.  Smoking too.<br />The book is based on three diaries that Brian Moeran kept during his four years living in Japan.  The book is broken down into three parts, each made up of chapters which are either one sentence long to many pages long and this gives the story an interesting and timeless flow.  In fact, the book is only 254 pages yet seems much longer.	2003-10-31

His silent mind draws her and she finds herself starting an adventure, an adventure that seem becomes a nightmare as murder becomes part of the plot.  In fact a few murders are mixed into the story and soon Sookie wonders if having a vampire as her boyfriend is such a good idea.<br />Funny as Hell - New Orleans has become the vampires' Mecca!

Richard Sharpe is sent into the storm to hunt down a britter English officer who has joined the forces of the Confederation.

Her enemy is a vampire.  A Master Vampire who doesn't seem to know anything about keeping a low profile.  He turns drug dealers into vampires, making them into his followers and at the same time making a profit.  Of course, he also rapes and kills a lot of people.  All this crime and death brings the cops in like flies to a corpse and gives me the impression that the head vampire is an idiot.  Gamera or Godzilla would of drawn less notice! The ending is somewhat anti-climactic and, in fact, very boring.<br />This is my second try at writing a review for this book. I guess the first never made it for some reason so I toned this one down a tad.  Bottom line - book is a waste of money, buy 'Blood Legacy: the Story of Ryan' or 'green trees' or even something by Laurell K. Hamilton.	2003-10-18

This second book is great - Multiple plots weaving together, true NON-stop action, greater interation between Anita Blake and Jean-Claude.  I didn't like the first book too much, but this one seems to work - the story moves smoothy, we now know many of the characters and something about Anita Blake hints at power and danger.  And she doesn't get her butt kicked...as much.<br />While the book does not focus on vampires, Jean-Claude, Master of the City, seems to appear more in these chapters than in &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;, mostly because they REALLY talk to each other instead of trying to stare each other down.<br />I got an older copy so as to have a normal looking cover.	2003-10-16

You can find books about vampires, no, whole SERIES about vampires at any book store and online store too!  Few of the authors can do anything new with them.  Sometimes they have a interesting character or a twisted plot to work with, but few rewrite the vampire myth.  Why bother?<br />Kerri Hawkins has bothered.  She embraced the vampire, changed it and made it her own.<br />The story starts out with Dr. Susan Ryerson getting a body from the morgue that shows signs of coming BACK TO LIFE.  The story started over six centuries ago, yet flows at a comfortable pace, keeping the reader happy and wanting to know what is going to happen next.  All the characters are complex, with merits and flaws, including the so-called 'Villains'.<br />I look forward to more books by the author set in the same universe!	2003-10-12

The characters seemed real, the plot solid and the flow was smooth.  The fears that Theodor Cuza develops about his religion and his faith, the interplay between Erich Kaempffer's naked greed and Klaus Woermann's military professionalism, only add to the reality of the setting.<br />But near the end the story started to get a little too wild, turning from a vampire/between a rock and a hard place/Lovecraft book into something more fitting of fantasy/Evil vs. Good/E.E.&quot;Doc&quot; Smith book.	2003-10-04

Chicago was in ruins, survivors were fleeing the burning cities and the sun was blocked by the nuclear winter that had been created by the bombs.  For a amoral vampire this SHOULD be a perfect time.  But it isn't.  Many of the humans have become contaminated, radiation sickness making their blood useless to him.  And the heathly humans are in danger from roaming bands of looters and killers, as food and water becomes more and more scarce.<br />Can he learn to feed without killing?  Can he learn to protect the humans he needs to live or will he give into his hunger?<br />I think Kittredge is one of the most realistic vampires I have ever read about.  He never pretends to be a good guy, he starts out doing what he does purely for selfish reasons.  He doesn't want to be a Rock Star or a God or discover the secrets of the Universe - he just wants to live.<br />And we don't know what will happen when the sun returns after the winter ends.	2003-09-26

Before I start with the review, let me point out that I am a fan of Mike but not of his written work.  His Megacheese got a solid four from me, while his later work, Mind Over Matters got a two.  I figured his dive into the world of fiction would be a fresh start and it WAS.  I found his plot, the idea of an author trying to break out of non-fiction history books into money-making novels about giant rats, interesting.  Mike's characters were twisted and the city of Holey was very surrealistic.  Within the page he attacks everything from fashion, pop and even the book industry.  The art on the cover of the book screamed bad 50s movie.  Very well crafted.<br />Yet I had to take a point away.  Many of the jokes were like bad run on sentences that he couldn't bring to a proper ending.  The flow, the very plot, got lost in the waves of humor he was trying to soak into the pages of the book.  On top of all that the very ending seemed kind of rushed and very bland.  Maybe it was too well crafted?<br />Maybe if he let Kevin Murphy co-write his next novel or...naaa.	2003-09-20

Her book is full of delightful details, not just about the people and the places, but she writes about their very clothes, right down to the pattern on their cloaks, and she dives into their deepest thoughts - no matter how dark and bloody they might be.  She loves every tiny piece of history that she can pour into Louis, Lestat and Claudia.  She pours in her knowledge, her own emotions and her pains to make real people to live and love and die within the yellowed pages of the book - my copy is from 1989 and VERY well used.

In this book Mr. Frank Ephraim not only tells us about the history of \\"Manilaners\\", Jews who fled Europe and headed to the Philippines, but also tells us about the Jewish community already there.  His book is detailed, with both the facts of history AND the emotions and actions of the people themselves.  We never feel that the Jews, Filipinos, Americans and Japanese are faceless puppets.<br />He starts off giving us a very complete history of the Philippines, then focusing on Europe and the problems that Jews had living under the growing power of the Third Reich.  Soon we are following the resourceful refugees to Manila.  We watch them start a new life, with the help of those around them, showing us the support and empathy that the Jews and Filipinos had for the newcomers.<br />Then the Japanese invaded and he shows us how everyone came even closer together, doing everything to live a normal life.  We learn about daily life, the struggle for food and trying to understand how to deal with the Japanese while they also deal with the big long term problems, like trying to find schools for their children and continuing their form of worship under the paranoid eyes of the Japanese.<br />Of course, the book ends with the American invasion, the bloody fight for Manila and the aftermath.  The author does nothing to hide the tragic results of the battle or the fact that even when peace came the Jews still had problems just making ends meet.<br />This is a book for anybody into Asian history, Jewish history, the history of the Philippines, World War Two and Japanese history.  A must for any history library, really, touching on many subjects.	2003-09-12

Most vampire fans can guess the rest.  The story is short, only 115 pages, fast and tragic, but the best vampire stories are always sad - who ever heard of happy vampires?  Besides members of the Malkavian Clan, of course.<br />I took one point away for two things.  One, vampires in the novel could still drink, eat normal food, have sex and all that.  Kind of makes them a tad too normal.  The second was the character of Colm's all TOO fast adjustment to being a vampire.  He slipped into the part too easily for me to believe.<br />I hope the author writes a few more books, maybe creating some of longer length and greater detail.  With less coke use.	2003-09-06

Being a sequel I figured it might be good.  With over 400 pages, there had to be something interesting within.  I was wrong.  It wasn't good, it was perfect.<br />The characters of Giraut and Margaret are painfully real, the science fiction is interesting, the ideas are beautiful, the story itself can't help but hook you and the two cultures really give the book many flavors.  The ending has a COUPLE of surprises, some of which you MAY of seen coming, but I doubt it.  With hindsight I can say, 'Oh..OK..', but the end was enjoyable, thoughtful and powerful.<br />I can't wait to get the FIRST book 'A Million Open Doors'.  I can't believe this is the same author who wrote 'Washington's Dirigible'.	2003-08-29

A very detailed book about uniforms in Japan, with major focus on school uniforms, but the book also deals with post-school uniforms in the work place and even in the home.  Lots of examples and a solid foundation set on past studies, books and surveys.  The author also shows the anti-uniform culture, which sometimes ends up being just as uniform.  Formal uniforms vs. the cult of playful kawaisa (cuteness).<br />Really interesting, seeming to follow the changes within the life of the Japanese, from school uniforms, to the college rest period (where you wear whatever you want), to the uniform (and job)they will be wearing the rest of their life.	2003-08-23

Many books on Japan and China will try to give you everything from a history lesson to a break-down of their culture and ideals.  Whole chapters are needed by the author just to define the terms he, or she, will be using.  This book is nothing like that.  She does not TELL us about Japanese school systems, she SHOWS us how a Japanese school works, through her eyes and the eyes of her two kids.  She explains about uniforms, Sports Day, lunches, how classes are set up, how many hours a student goes to school in a year, how a class is run and so on.<br />The book is an easy read, full of details that other books just seem to over-look.  Remember, that this is dealing with one elementary school, and does not reflect how things are done in the Senior High Schools and/or Colleges, but it does destroy a few myths I had about how the Japanese taught their children and the book was also a delight to read!<br />Try to get a copy, any condition.  It's worth it!	2003-08-12

Peter Hessler joined the Peace Corps and taught English and American literature at the local college at Fuling, a city at the point where the Yangtze River and the Wu River meet.  His stories are a mixture of history, first-hand accounts of Chinese society and his own growth during the two years he was there.<br />His book is honest and very forward.  His focus on one part of China, one city, allows him to get into great detail about city life, interaction with the city-folk and many of the problems he had.  This is not a happy, happy, joy, joy book.  He had many problems besides the happy times, the problems caused by his own temper and sometimes caused by his lack of understanding.  A couple of times he even lies to the Chinese to get AROUND problems, something that could of easily back-fired and made things worse.<br />Also, I feel, he was sometimes TOO passive when dealing with the Chinese, but this was very likely caused by the fact that he was not a master of the language.  A reader can tell when trouble is about to begin before it happens, which just goes to show how well Peter Hessler can write.<br />One sad note.  The cover of the book shows, what I assume, is the docks/waterfront of old Fuling.  If so, by now they are under water, as the first stage of the dam is complete.	2003-08-07

Inspector Imanishi is trying to solve a murder with only one clue, the name Kameda.  This story is a police procedural story that does a good job of showing us Japan in the 60s, where youth worships the new idols, such as young actors and musicians, and ancient heritage fights with political upheaval.  The old and the new meet in post-war Japan, yet it is not thrust down our throats.<br />Seicho Matsumoto is writing about Japan for Japanese readers.  He does not need to explain every single detail of culture and society.  He does a great job because, frankly, it was published in 1961!<br />What you get is a fast flowing, showing-us-not-telling-us, novel of Japan and one character who has to swim through it to solve a crime.  Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down till you finish.	2003-07-31

Fitzgerald, is a very smart, but also very greedy boy, who finds all kinds of ways to make a penny (back when a penny was worth something).  The chapters mostly involve him trying to con people out of their money OR trying to make money from schemes that most of us would think of as unethical.<br />Yet he also uses that great brain to solve problems for others kids, such as Andy who thinks he is so plump useless without his lost leg that he tries to kill himself or the Jenson kids who got lost in the Skeleton Caves.<br />The chapter on Abie, his strongbox and his pride really got to me and I'm not sure how a kid, even a mature one, will respond to the issues brought up in that part of the book.<br />The book is bitter-sweet, the fantasy of the good old days mixed with realistic themes of every day life.	2003-07-25

Kornbluth was a co-author with Frederik Phol and was also the editor of 'The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction', but before that he also wrote stories.  'The Syndic' is a full length novel of his that he should of done more work on.  One problem is he goes through so fast, he gives little in the way of details.  He touches on the Mob, the Syndic, a US Government with its capital in Iceland and navel bases in Ireland and England, while also talking about magical witches and psychology all within less than 250 pages.  There is little or no background about how the world ended up this way and there is no suggestion that it will get better either!<br />We don't even get a chance to like the characters or really understand the settings or cultures we get to visit.  The story is hard to pin down, is it sci-fi or a lecture on politics?<br />I would not suggest this book, unless you know and enjoy the author's work ALREADY.	2003-07-22

A town of doughnut making machines, mouse traps that don't harm the mice and no lynchings.<br />For ages 9 and up, a great book for boys and girls.

Tom, a boy genius, who has a 'great brain' and a money-loving heart, is always conning people out of money, candy or whatever else they might have.  His father sends him to a Catholic Academy for boys in Salt Lake City, figuring that the priests there will tame him.  But Tom refuses to be tamed and does his best to get around the rules, outwit the superintendent AND make money in the bargin!<br />Watch Tom become the fastest potatoe peeler in the west, open an illegal candy store and introduce a new kind of game called basketball.  I plan to get the rest and enjoy my childhood memories.  The better parts, anyway.	2003-07-18

The first story is a graphic novel which pits Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, HG Well's Invisible Man, H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain, Robert L. Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll AND Bram Stoker's Minna Murray against an evil force, a crimelord so powerful that he may end up destroying much of London if not stopped.  The setting is placed in the late 19th century England, but a slightly twisted verison, lovingly detailed and illustrated by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill.<br />The second story places Allan Quatermain in a story with HP Lovecraft's Randolph Carter, Edgar Rice Burrough's John Carter and HG Well's Time Traveller.  The setting is that of a story from Lovecraft, with unknown dangers and fear from beyond reality.  The story is very much in the style of a serial, with a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter and every chapter starting off with a few paragraphs to give you background information, as if you have been waiting weeks for the next issue!  The second story happens before the great adventures and events of the first, so you may wish to even start with that one first.  Both hint as great things to come.<br />I can't wait for the second volume!	2003-07-16

Or can it be changed at a whim, changed by nothing but a dream of a sleeping man?  George Orr is that man.  For some of his dreams change the real world, because his dreams sometimes come true.  But Mr. Orr does NOT want to change the world, he just wants to be a normal man with normal dreams.<br />When George tries to take drugs to end his dreaming he is sent to Dr. Haber to be cured of his fears.  But what happens when Dr. Haber also realizes Orr's gift/curse is not the product of an insane mind, but in fact is real and decides to use it for the 'good' of mankind?<br />If you liked the book there are two movies available to watch.  I prefer the older version made by WNET/THIRTEEN (PBS).	2003-07-15

Why do worms always show up after the rain?<br />The book comes with an index, so you can look up facts fast, and the intro comes with an e-mail address because 'The Wild File' which the book is based on still lives on the pages of 'Outside' magazine and they still need questions!<br />Easy to read, funny and with answers anybody can understand.

Volume One was the set up, the cheese and crackers, but in volume two we finally get to the beef and potatoes, the main course.  We watch as Khan goes up against Gary Seven, Roberta Lincoln and the rest of the planet INCLUDING his own super-brothers and super-sisters who refuse to follow him.  What will Khan do when he realizes that he won't be allowed to rule the Earth?  And how can anybody stop him?<br />Khan is shown as a ruthless, reckless, yet thoughtful leader, who cares for his own people and, at first, most of the world.  But he, like most of us, slowly comes to the understanding that Earth's problems are not easy to solve and its people are not easy to handle.<br />Better than the first volume!	2003-07-10

Well I think the author has done a good job with the characters and the first few chapters, hooking the reader easily, the end of the book is wanting.  First, the ending seems rushed, second she shifts the story away from the planet M'Kwethet and their homage to the Goa'uld to the fact that M'Kwethet's Stargate had no DHD and SG-1 has to find a way to get home.  Like in 'The Morpheus Factor', a book set later in the series which I red first, the natives are left with their problems which may have been made even worse by SG-1's visit.	2003-06-29

Original.<br />Nine stories that show us the future of man, with his flaws, his merits and his outward spread from Earth.  John Varley thinks big also.  In many of his stories it is pointed out that mankind was kicked off of the planet Earth by...somebody.<br />See, that is the best part.  Many of the stories happen in a setting in which much of the background is unknown to us or just hinted at.  But the heart of the stories are always people, their emotions and needs.  Some sex too.<br />Many of the short stories were later used to create some very interesting movies.	2003-06-20

The characters of Jackson and O'Neil seem to be in-character and many of the new characters, such as Hathor and Walter Draven, are very interesting.  For example, Walter Draven, of the UMC, is both greedy and forward, yet knows how far he can push people.  Hathor wants power, but is realistic about what she can and can not do.<br />The book allows you a peek at Ra's decaying empire and the reality of having a Stargate to another world.  The language barrier is still a problem, no short-cuts here, and Bill McCay does not plan to make it easy for any of the characters.  Both Earth and Hathor wish to exploit the planet of Abydos, whose natives just want to be left alone.<br />The book does give hints and flashbacks of past events to help fill in the setting and give background on some of the 'evil' characters BUT not too much.<br />The best part is while the book can stand alone, it is the first of a five book series.  If you overlook the small flaws the story is very solid.	2003-06-16

The chapters in the book were great and in one case the author was able to disprove one of the old stories.  I wish the photos of ghosts were a little clearer, but I have to say the author did a good job, in most cases visiting the places where the ghosts haunted and even interviewing many of the people who were involved.  In the epilogue Victor C. Klein debates about where ghosts come from.  Are they our fears?  Or somekind of electromagnetic energy?  Are they really the dead, trapped in our world, or something from beyond our world?  Footnotes, a nice bibliography and a small index completes the slim book.<br />I would say that this is a great book if you live in New Orleans or plan to visit.  Perfect for carrying around during a tour or tossing into a small bag.<br />Only about 126 pages long, but being published in 1993 means most of the information is relatively updated when compared to other books on ghosts.  The author points out that the city has changed.  Old haunted houses have been torn down and new buildings are now where forests and swamps use to be.<br />ENJOY!	2003-06-14

The book itself is lovely, with pictures of the animals and habitats of future Earth with details about behavior and the changing planet.<br />The only problem is that the book does not go beyond the series.  There is no extra information about the future creatures and the only real add on is the small glossary in the back.  If you had to pick between this or the series on video or DVD, buy the video or DVD.<br />With 160 pages I wanted more.

Within this first book of the Lensman seires we learn about how two galaxies slam into each other and the races, the Eddore and the Arisia, meet.  E.E. Smith shows us how, over time, the two super-races use others while slowly developing their own powers.<br />Within this book is the seed for so many later stories.  Star Wars, Star Trek and Babylon Five seem to have been lifed from the pages yet 'Triplanetary' itself seems to be a mixture of bad science AND a bad story.<br />I am sure many fans of this author will get mad at me, pointing out that I am comparing his work to later authors and stories, but I am not.  I am comparing it to works from the same period and EARLIER.  H.G. Wells, Olaf Stapledon, H.P.Lovecraft and Karel Capek are just a few authors I can name who seem to be able to make believable stories.  They may have some flaws but they know how to write over them.  Bad science is cancelled out by a good story or a weak story is held up by great science or interesting characters.<br />'Triplanetary' has only gotten worse with age.  It seems like a story based on an old sci-fi serial.  Only buy it if you like techno-babble, fantasy sci-fi or just plain fantasy with some science tossed in.<br />One chapter is about Atlantis!  If this was a film MST3K would of REFUSED to use it.<br />It was turned into anime.  Maybe that version is better as I have heard it has little or nothing to do with the books, besides the title.	2003-06-13

Matt Cairns is in our near future, in the 21 Century when the European Space Agency makes first contact with aliens.  Gregor Cairns is in our FAR future, is a exobiology student who must REDISCOVER the secrets of interstellar travel.  The two stories have been woven together.  The First Chapter starts off with Gregor, the Second with Matt and so on.  The author is somewhat a tease, because right when something seems about to happen, right when some new piece of information is about to help answer an important question, he ends the chapter and starts a new one in the other story line!<br />Don't worry, the book is full of cool stuff.  Smart squids, starships, REAL dinosaurs, Area 51 (Dreamland), tiny Gods, flying saucers, spies, cyberpunk and more.  YES, he likes to deal with politics, but it is part of the setting, not thrust into our faces.  If you enjoy mystery, alien races (that turn out to be less than alien) and high-tech in your Sci-Fi, this is the book for you!	2003-06-06

The 'cowboy Bebeop Anime Guide 1' -the first out of six volumes- starts off with a few character bios, then gives summaries and information on the first six episodes of the series.  The last few chapters deal with the setting of Cowboy Bebop universe, with a chapter explaining about bounty hunters along with files on the items used by the characters and lots of sketches on everything from the types of spacesuits used to the character of Vicious.<br />The information is interesting, but most of it can be found if you have the DVDs.  This book would make a good gift for Cowboy Bebop fans who have everything else or for people who need the information at their fingertips, like fan fiction writers.  Lots of color pictures right from the anime help fill out the work but it still feels kind of weak.	2003-04-29

China is a woman who runs a restaurant who has two boarders on the second floor of the building: Professor Breckenridge and his young assistant Jim Floyd.  The PRofessor and Jim happen to be broke and can't pay the rent.  Well, they're not really broke as much as they spend all their money on equipment.

Modern Mongolia: Reclaiming Genghis Khan is a lovely book, in four parts,with lots of color pictures.  The first part called, 'My Mongolia', tells about Mongolia, the people, places and their history up to the 1900s.  The second part, titled 'The Twentieth Century: From Domination to Democracy', tells the story of Mongolia under the China and, later, Russia's control.  The third chapter is called 'Deel, Ger and Altar: Continuity and Charge in Mongolian Material Culture' which shows us the changes in what the people used, lived in and wore (sometimes based on what they had and sometimes based on what they were ALLOWED to have).  The last part is called 'Genghis Khan, Father of Mongolian Democracy' and shows that, while Mongolians did not have Democracy under Khan, they did have many democratic principles even before Genghis Khan showed up.  Under the Khan many of this ideas (rule by law, equality of citizens, participatory government and human rights) were made more powerful by the fact that he united them and made them independent from outside powers.  Genghis Khan is a Founding Father ANY nation could be proud of.  AT least he had all his teeth and didn't wear a white wig!<br />The book itself was written by four authors who used a mixture of fact and first person accounts to make a book that you can tell they all enjoyed making.  The only thing missing is a copy of the Mongolian constitution.  But I did like the beginning of the preamble which they showed in the book:<br />&quot;We the people of Mongolia....&quot;  Always a good start!	2003-04-14

In this timeline England fails to save the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk, where the German army, instead of waiting for England to roll over and give up(as in our timeline), defeats the 500,000 of the UK's best troops before they can escape.<br />The England in this timeline is not as hopeful as in our's.  Their morale is in the pits after the 'failure' of Dunkirk.  The German bombing and the U-boat attacks have a much greater effect on the British (adding salt to the wound).<br />The author does not invent super-weapons nor does he have Hitler replaced by somebody smarter.  He decides to work on the people of England.  Parents worrying about their kids, leaders worrying about their people and a nation that is hurt and war tired.  People who decide they DO want peace at any cost, even their freedoms.<br />A short spy novel, only 161 pages, with some spelling mistakes, but a great first try for a fiction novel.	2003-04-10

In The Probability Broach we have a really good mystery set in the background of a world where libertarian ideas flourished.  The book set up a foundation for future stories.<br />Yet in The American Zone we have a badly designed plot thrust into the background while the libertarian ideas are pushed to the foreground.  What I would of enjoyed is less of Lucy jabbering, and pissing off people, and more of a real plot set in new areas of the Confederacy or other parts of the alternate world.  Surely Europe and Asia have developed their own forms of libertarian governments based on their own ideas, culture and history?<br />I'm sorry but some of the chapters could of been removed from the book without hurting the plot at all, a sure sign of a book that was written for something else BESIDES the story.<br />Come on, your preaching to the chorus!  Turn around and talk to the rest, deliver the ideas of freedom and liberty WITHOUT scaring the day-lights out of them.<br />Lets face it, Lucy is slightly forward, if not sometimes rude towards everybody and anything she does not like or believe in.  I love her, but many people, even from the same political parties, sometimes don't see eye to eye, this is not the best way to present a Libertarian, even if she is a person of fiction.<br />I would suggest you start out with other books by L. Neil Smith.	2003-04-08

The author starts off with the history of anime and manga then gets into folktales, hardcore anime, themes, the Way of the Warrior and the Way of the Teeenage Girl, Japanese mothers, Christianity, Shinto, Idols, nature, war and anti-war themes, birth, death and rebirth, giant robots, Sailor Moon, Pokemon and so much more.<br />SOME of the things that the author presents as facts are wrong.  For example, on page 122, says \\"Long ago, two members of the interplantary noble house of Jurai traveled to Earth: Tenchi Masaki's mother...and grandfather Yosho-\\" which is wrong. Achika, Tenchi's mother was born on Earth.  Yosho had been on Earth for over 700 years guarding the Masaki Shrine.  As he was chasing the dangerous pirate-demon, Ryoko, I DOUBT he brought a baby along for the ride.<br />Also, at the end, the author tells you the book is based on his own favorites.  What happened to list of resources, the titles of anime and manga and history books we should read?  If you want to be told what to watch and read DON'T buy this book.  This author wants you to think.  How un-American.<br />Oh, the afterword is also kind of weak.<br />I would suggest this book for a person who just entered the world of anime.  It is newer than most and VERY detailed.	2003-04-04

That might sound a tad weird, but the book, by following the history of the banana, also follows America's history in showing us how the banana created developments in transportation, fed international trade in South America, created the health campaigns within the US, brought about marketing designed to create a demand for bananas and the increase in the public's interest in the tropics.  The banana was also a weapon against communism and built us an American Empire.  BOW BEFORE THE MIGHTY BANANA!	2003-03-27

The author Chelsea Quinn Yarbro took a interesting man, Comte de Saint-Germain, out of history and made a novel, making him into a vampire.  Why not?  He never did eat in public and he was always telling stories of events that happened centuries earlier.  His character in the book is just as amazing as his character in real history.<br />THAT is the good point.  The rest of the book is not as good.  The characters have no life.  They are either 2-dimensional or sterotypes.  The strong willed, free thinking woman who is ahead of her time.  The ruthless and powerful bad guy.  The henchman who turns to the good side by the acts of kindness carried out by the good guy.<br />The book is like a stew made with one carrot and a hand full of pebbles.  The only good thing about reading this book is that you will find out about Saint-Germain and can look for books about the REAL man.	2003-03-22

It also has maps and gives you information on the environments and what changes have happened to the Earth during the 50 million years.

First off the book explains WHY female harems existed in the first place.  The simple answer is this. If the sovereign gets married to a Princess of another power that power could lay claim to the throne.  BUT if he has offspring with a bunch of slaves, women who are not of the Muslim faith and are not linked to powerful families, than outsiders could not lay claim to the throne by right of blood.<br />Yet don't think these concubines were powerless.  In fact, through their sons and daughters, through networks based on retainers, son-in-laws and slaves, they gained great influence and wealth.  Mothers of princes, wives and royal mothers to the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire, they were a big part of the inner workings and political events within the palace.<br />They were eyes and ears of the Sultan when he was away, they were symbols of benevolence and powerful diplomats for the Empire, they were tutors and guardians for their sons.<br />The book has a helpful glossary, a two page genealogical chart, two maps and is VERY detailed.  I would suggest this book ONLY to people interested in the Ottoman Empire, the Middle East or women in history.  It is also VERY dry.	2003-03-13

We know little of who they are or why they come, but they easily learn about how humans work and are soon taking over the planet (but I won't tell you how).  The second book (and in reality the first book published) we find ourselves on a Earth that has been ruled by the Masters and their Tripods for as long as anybody can remember.  While Will Parker, Henry Parker and Beanpole, the major characters of the last three books, seem to find everything from before the Masters, such as the City of the Ancients and even a simple wristwatch, strange and fearful the readers (us) find it normal and rich in details only they can truly understand.

He talks about the smallest commercial movie theater, where the owner sells the tickets out of his bedroom window, to the multiplex, the sing-along film, the club cinema and the cinema grill. He deals with the food, even trying to live on popcorn, individual pizzas and shrink-wrapped sandwiches for a week. He deals with movies in the park, movies in the museums and movies in Hollywood! He deals with the people too. The critics, the fanboys, the kids and the people who work AT the movies.<br />It is funny, yet has serious points. One whole chapter is on September 11. It so happens I was reading this while on the bus to the Pentagon. This chapter was so powerful that I started to cry.<br />The book reminds me of the greatest movie I ever saw. Star Wars. My family saw it when it first came out in a drive-in theater. My brother and I sat on top of the car, a station-wagon, and watched this great sci-fi flick on a background of real stars. AND it will never happen again. Drive-ins are few and far between. The movie itself has been CHANGED and even cars are different. I don't trust any of this tiny models to hold up my own weight (or even that of my brother's young kids).<br />Each chapter is a week, with the list of the films he saw and where he saw them (which makes a nice list of movies you might wish to rent or buy in the future).<br />Flip open the book, get a bucket of butter-flavored popcorn and ENJOY!	2003-02-24

Winstin Smith is us, men and women who believe in Truth and history, family and love and sex, if such things can be linked together.  And Orwell shows us they CAN be linked, because they are freedoms, as important as the freedom to vote or speak.  Without the basic rights that even many ANIMALS have, without the foundation of current passions and private memories, a free world can NEVER exist.<br />Maybe I am reading too much into it.  But I feel the book goes beyond fears of the industrial elite within Western societies, big corporations and Communism.  Or maybe it goes beneath these fears, to the root of them all, which is our fear of losing our way.	2003-02-23

The book follows the development of psychological warfare, at first with a little history and then getting into details about its use against the Japanese.  The author points out that the use of propaganda was not very effective till the Japanese started to lose and till the Allies learned what did and did not work.  Getting to know the enemy and finding his weak points is as important as selecting the right words to use and finding out if it's working.  Truth is VERY important as you want the reader to trust you as a source of REAL information, information he/she can see as observable facts or can be checked on later.<br />The author breaks down the basics of GOOD psywar operations with a number of general conclusions near the end.  A must for anybody interested in military history or the Pacific Theater during World War Two.	2003-02-15

Follow a German soldier from his training, to the battlefield, from Russia to Italy, to the Battle for Berlin and then to his capture by the Russians. The details of life both on the front and at home really brings us into the war, allowing us to see how conditions change and how his view on war and the Reich also change. A few extras, like a small glossary and a organizational chart are not really needed. The book is about life in the Reich as much as the battles the Wehrmacht fought. Lots about the daily life of the German soldier, from their food, how they dealt with the weather, how they dealt with the horror of battle.<br />A must for seeing the war from a PERSON's point of view.	2003-02-08

Written from a member of the German General Staff's point of view, this is about the early decisive victories and the later defeats, and what it can teach us about warfare today.  The book really deals with the action on an operational level, but does deal with tactics, planning and the importance of using tanks, artillery, infantry and air units together.  Lots of maps, the book is a blow-by-blow history of the German campaigns in Europe, North Africa, Russia and the final days of the Third Reich.  Compares German and Allied forces, how tough they were, how flexible their reactions in battle were, their equipment and so on.	2003-02-08

There's the book to tell you!<br />Mr. Spick first starts off with a chapter explaining basic combat tactics and then dives into the history, starting with the Spanish Civil War and ending with retreat from the East and the Jet Aces.  Lots of first person accounts, detailed information on both German and Allied aircraft, and postwar examination of military records.

July 20, 1944: Hitler is killed by a bomb and a military coup is attempted. Little did the German military officers know that Himmler would beat them to finishing line, taking control of the Reich and bringing about changes that might save it.<br />I found the plot realistic, along with many of the characters (with all their merits and flaws), and thought the authors did very well.  I wish more writers were as good.  Rommel, Himmler and Patton all seem to come alive.  The alternate history was done so well it does seem like a alternate reality.<br />One of the reviewers complained that the book felt like a wargame, where the two authors just rolled dice and such, and frankly if this is true, I also wish more authors played military role playing games.  Let the 'dice' keep it fair!<br />I plan to get 'Fox on the Front'.	2003-01-30

The book has three parts:<br />The first is in the author's own words about the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 17, 1936 and the early actions taken by anarchists, communists and others to defend Barcelona against the Nationalists/Military/Rebels.  It is a mixture of bitterness, irony and a touch of hope.  If the workers, for one bright, shining moment were able to bring about a paradise for the people, even only for a short time THAN surely, one day, it can happen again.<br />The second part is a small timeline of minor and major events.<br />The last part greatly adds to the author's writings with photos on daily life, militiamen and militiawomen, meetings, ruins, tanks and more.<br />I would of liked to have more, but I think the book really helps you see the beginning of the war from the view of the people instead of, like the larger books do, filling your head up with names, parties, political movements, every leader who picks up a gun and so many details you can't keep it all straight.	2003-01-28

Sharpe is part of a military expedition to push the ruthless Tippoo from his throne and kick the French out of India.  The action is very realistic.  You can almost smell the guns smoke, hear the screams of pain and feel the blood on your hands.  Sharpe, and the other men in His Majesty's service, are looters and knife-fighters and DAMN good infantry.<br />The plot is sound, the details are excellent and the characters make you feel anger and joy and sometimes even pride in their actions.<br />Tippoo is a well balanced character who is the kind of leader I won't MIND fighting under.  I'm not saying he is a NICE guy, but he does seem to care.  Even the French Colonel seems to be somebody I would prefer to be commanded by than the British officers in this book.<br />The author adds some humor too!<br />\\"I'm a Scot,\\" a sour voice spoke from the rear rank.	2003-01-25

Harry Harrison starts out with a interesting idea.  What if Prince Albert was dead when a U.S. warship stopped a British ship and seized two Confederate emissaries on their way to England?  In our history Prince Albert was able to defuse the crisis.  But what if Queen Victoria responded like the rest of England with outrage and declared war on the U.S. of A?<br />Things become A LOT more interesting.  Soon Lincoln and the North finds itself fighting both the South and an English invasion from Canada.  That, in itself would of made for an interesting novel.<br />But Harrison can't let it go at that.  Right when you think the North might lose with too many fronts to fight on the British Navy invades the WRONG city.  Instead of saying, &quot;OOps, sorry, you Yanks all look alike.&quot; it decides to continue to fight BOTH sides.  Of course, the North and the South join up together and the tide turns again.<br />BESIDES the fact that I don't picture the British Navy landing troops on the wrong coast, I don't believe that either the British navy nor the British army would be so easy to defeat.  I also don't see the British officers as being so stupid.  True, it would of been a costly battle for the British, with the USA and CSA having more local ironclades to defend their coast, more Americans would of joined the army on both sides and the defenders would have shorter supply lines, but still it would not have been so easy.<br />I'm not saying the Americans would not win, bit it would of taken longer and frankly, I still don't think the British would of attacked the South by accident.  They HAVE maps.<br />Also the book shows British troops as looters and murders.  Which they were, but they were also DAMN tough fighters!	2003-01-24

Jeannine Davis-Kimball tells us about her adventures in exploring women's roles in ancient Eurasia through archaeological sites, Greek and Roman legends and how the people of the steppe tribes live now. She moves across the land with the speed of thought, from the mummies of China to the warrior queens of Erie. Woman were nurturers, warriors and leaders (and still are in Mongolia) sharing both power and responsible within the tribes. I think the best part about the book is not only showing that women were sometimes in charge but that men within these societies were also nurturers and shared with the daily chores. Maybe both men and women were just too busy with life to worry about sexism and gender issues. Maybe sexism is a byproduct of progress?<br />The book covers alot but doesn't get bogged with too much detail. Very much up-to-date information. I don't think I agree with one or two points but it's an enjoyable book to read.	2003-01-23

An introduction by David Drake is followed by: But Loyal to His Own, At Any Price, The Butcher's Bill, Hangman, The Irresistible Force, Cultural Conflict, Liberty Port and Standing Down.  Many of the stories are important to the Hammer's Slammers' universe.  But Loyal to His Own and Standing Down are about Hammer himself, as a man and a commander.  The Butcher's Bill is the first story written about the Slammers.  The new story is Irresistible Force which continues the story of Lamartiere, who we met in The Immovable Object - which makes TWO stories set in the Hammer's Slammers universe about a character who was never trained to drive or fire or do anything with a tank!<br />This book is a must because many of the repeat stories are in books that have been out of print a very long time.	2003-01-17

The people are the poorest in the universe, having to import carbon, oxygen and even dirt. They live in tunnels drilled into the layer of gold because it is the LEAST dangerous metal to their health, giving birth is a crime and they go around naked because they can't afford clothes. You would think being inserted into a smart tank that will feed you, take care of you and allow you to do almost anything you want in virtual reality would be a good thing when compared to being sent to the hydroponic vats.<br />And it was a good thing...till you and your tank had to face REAL combat.	2003-01-14

Kaplan shows us why we must go back to past wisdom from the Roman, Greeks and Chinese to deal with the future of foreign policy in a world becoming more and more like that of the ancient world then what we would call 'modern'.  He uses Sun-Tzu's maxims, Machiavelli's warnings, Churchill's knowledge, Livy's ideas and the works of many other philosophers to guide us in the book.  Examples of leaders, from Tiberius to FDR, fill the book and help bring meat to the framework of thought he develops in the book.<br />Anybody interested in the future interaction of nations or political science in general needs this book.  Warning, Kaplan tells it like it is and points out that humans are run by self-interest, fear and honor NOT ideals and the need for democratic elections.	2003-01-02

The author uses a major Shinto Shrine, Nagasaki's Suwa Shrine, as the focus of the book.  It starts out with chapters about Kami, the history of the shrine and a overview of rituals and ceremonies then the book is cut up into Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.  It has lots of details, including, in the back, a map of the shrine, glossary of terms, list of festivals and rituals of the Suwa Shrine and works cited.  The details are about this ONE Shrine, so if you wanted a book on all kami and shrines in Japan THIS is not it.  Yet it does give a nice first person account of events in a Shinto Shrine, dealing with beliefs, practices and how the shrine interacts with the city's community, businesses and families.  Kind of like seeing the forest by examing one of the trees.<br />A must for people interested in Shintoism or Japan.	2002-12-31

Cut off during the Melcon Armageddon the planet was absorbed by the Aetryx, an alien race who believed they were a race of Gods.  The humans of the Cofederation Mobile Army Corps decide to launch an invasion to free the enslaved populace.  But there seems to be a few problems.  One, many of the people of Caern seem to be loyal towards the Aetryx.  Two, the Aetryx seem to have Bolos within their ranks who are just as loyal.  Three, the Aetryx may really be GODS!<br />The book is packed solid with good battle action, with savage space combat and lots of Bolos fighting on their own.  Yes, sometimes the humans get in the way, but without humans the Bolos have no reason to fight, to reach for victory and to overcome their own limitations.  Anyway the Bolos spend a good first-third of the novel on their own, fighting for their lives, before the humans even make land-fall.  THEN things really get rough!	2002-12-16

(And, frankly, how do you flash-freeze such large animals?)<br />While you might not like the answers, I like the fact that they don't ONCE talk about aliens. I'm sick of aliens.

This is followed by the not-so-well-known 'The Greatest Adventure' by John Taine.  'At The Mountains of Maddness' by H.P.

Far from it.  Many were not happy with how the government was handling the war OR the fact there was a war.  The book starts with a timeline of the events before and during the American Revolution AND a chapter dealing with the relationship between the press and the government.  Then, after the foundation is poured the book starts to build up the case by dealing with how the public, via the letters in British newspapers, show their support or lack of support.  They react to the American's petitions to the Crown for peace, the question of Peace or War, worries about trade, the French and the aftermath. Slightly over 200 pages and worth it.

Hannibal and the consequences of the second Punic War are next, followed by chapters on the Italian economy, municipal politics, patronage and Romanization, Roman domination and citizenship, and in the final act the book deals with the Roman instruments of power; money, clients and prestige.	2002-10-10

Most books on humor use observational humor about events that happened to the author or about facts that turn out to be funny when looked at thru the twisted lens of the author.  Such authors, like Dave Barry, can make us laugh till people on the subway train decide to leave their seat next to us and move to another - true story!<br />Others, like the late and great, Douglas Adams could make us laugh with puns, funny scenes and fantasy settings because he was a master with the English language.<br />Mike Nelson is NOT that kind of author.  Some of the chapters of his book made me laugh, but most had me recoiling in horrible and looking very confused.  You know the look, the one you get when your chewing on something soft and something in your mouth makes a crunching noise?<br />Most of his chapters made me feel like somebody had volunteered me for a ten mile Boy Scout hike.  You know, the one where they dump you in the middle of nowhere, in a forest, and you walk all day to another spot that looks the same and is also in the middle of nowhere.  This book felt like a novel version of the Blair Witch Project.  I started at point 'A', walked to point 'B', crawled to point 'C' and by point 'J' I wondered, &quot;Will this ever end? Where are we? What's the point? Are we there yet?&quot;  But Nelson kept driving, refusing to stop even when I needed a restroom!<br />After reading it you will feel slightly upset, maybe even disgusted, and will wonder about the state of the world in which we live in where such a book can get published.<br />I'm sorry Mike, but this book is not Ha-Ha! funny, it is you-need-a-padded-cell funny.  It made me want to go after you with a leaf blower!  The 'Movie Megacheese' book he did was good - go buy that one.	2002-10-09

Supply and logisitics are VERY important to any military history and here it is! The book starts out with a general chapter on the Macedonian army and its logistic system (such as how much food the army needed, the time needed to rest and feed the animals, how fast it moved and the methods that could be used to deliver and transport such supplies needed by the men and animals). The other chapters deal with each region, for example Chapter 2 deals with how the system worked in Greece and Turkey, based on archaeological work done in Asia, careful study of the landscape, climate and the military operations carried out by Alexander. The Appendixs deal with such subjects such as rations and routes taken by the army. Along with 16 maps in the end, the tiny book, only about 194 pages long, is STUFFED full of data. It is a must for any fan of Alexander the Great or anybody into military history.<br />A great book to read along with J.F.C. Fuller's 'The Generalship of Alexander the Great'.	2002-10-05

Quizzes and information on food, sex, gender, art, religion, humor, historical figures and events, bloody noses and even architecture.  Gilles Poitras uses humor and knowledge on anime to write a book for anybody who wants to learn about some of the things that happen that non-Japanese might miss.  Lot of the information is based on such mainstream cartoons as Ranma 1/2 and Tenchi Muyo!, but there is also a small list of books in the back that were also used WHICH allows the reader to find more books on the issues he or she may wish to focus on.  Remember, the book also deals with the fact that the Japanese seem to be interested in age difference between males and females in relationships, women with guns and, yes, big breasts.  IT is not that the author is not being serious, but in fact VERY serious and open minded.  If one is going to explore anime one has to explore ALL parts of it and not just one side.<br />In fact, I would also suggest 'The Erotic Anime Movie Guide' by Helen McCarthy and Jonathan Clements.	2002-09-27

It also deals with the media's reactions to anime and how marketing strategies make a cartoon worse than it started out with. For example, ... boys are more likely to buy a cartoon with a adult rating than one for family viewing. Also the book shows how most ... anime is bought up by mainstream video/DVD viewers NOT anime fans (who are more likely going to want the Japanese, and therefore pre-eroticized, version of the story).<br />Contains adult material, so only for 18 years or older AND only for the serious reader.	2002-09-27

Captain Van Toch finds a bay which is home to a giant salanmander which he soon comes to realize is a very smart salanmander. He ends up training them to hunt for pearls, in return giving them knives to fight off their ancient enemy - the sharks. After he dies the world ends up taking over and exploiting them. These 'Newts' are trained to work underwater, carrying out projects to increase the landmass, clean harbours and build aircraft islands. Soon the military is training them to fight, the schools are training them to read and write, and the newts are also being taught about God, freedoms, history and other subjects that slowly change them to being equal to mankind in every field of science and knowledge.<br />What happens when MANKIND is the Newts' new enemy?<br />Is this a warning about exploiting the workers? Or a warning against mankind losing what makes us human? Or maybe a warning against relaying on machines too much? Or is it a warning about how man fights man?

On the surface this book published in 1888 is nothing but a small science fiction book about the future, but it doesn't take much digging to find the socialist vision of the future within.  While very interesting and, yes, thought provoking, many parts of the book read very much like a political science book than a utopian novel.  It is entertaining, yes, but I would not look at it as a study of human society.  The book shows the government as 'allowing' things to happen, such as the evolution of small businesses to huge monopolies, while in our own history we know the government of the early 20th century fought it tooth and nail, with anti-trust laws, while the people fought the idea of monopolies, refusing to become nothing more than unfeeling consumers.<br />We are more than just capitalists and workmen.

Olaf Stapleton has made a novel, not just of science fiction, but of philosophy and the future of mankind. From the first man to the last, we follow mankind, how it develops, the problems it faces, not only in their changing environments, but also their social problems and the problems within mankind's mind. Sometimes Mr. Stapleton only hints at the details and problems as he takes us across history in leaps of thousands and, sometimes, millions of years. I take a point away for his use of 'telepathic' powers within the story and the fact that he seems to think that man needs millions of years to change cultures or even invent such things as rocket flight! But rememeber that this man's works effected later generations of thinkers, sci-fi writers and scientists.<br />If you liked this book, you might wish to try getting 'Star Maker' by the same author.	2002-09-01

This book is a three parter. In the first part John W. Young explains to us how language in Orwell's \\"1984\\" was used for thought control. In part Two and Three, he compares the fiction to the reality of language and terminology used in Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. Not only does he show us the flaws in totalitarion languages, he even shows us the counter-languages that develop to help people under the dictatorial rule keep things 'real'.<br />One point he makes is that while governments have a hard time changing the meaning of words or banning them completely, they can make words worthless by using them so much that the words lose all meaning. Kind of like how we use 'democratic' today.	2002-08-31

Dr. Brian Stableford's book deals with mankind's future after the biological revolution, in which man finds ways to control both his environment and himself.  Mankind will become masters of evolution designing animals to generate food and energy while at the same time allowing mankind to live longer, better lives.  The book also talks about man/machine hybrids, brains being linked to computers, super-intelligent machines, biological weapons of war and even mind-control.<br />Lots of details and great pictures!	2002-08-28

It is based on science, forecasting and imagination.  The last few chapters deal with the future societies of mankind on the Earth, in space and the far distance future, where mankind is so alien it can no longer be called Homo sapiens sapiens.<br />Do NOT confuse this book with \\"Future Man\\" by Brain Stableford.  That book is papaerback with lots of pictures.  THIS book is hardcover with only a few charts and no color pictures.	2002-08-28

Star Trek fans, computer nerds, DR WHO? lovers and AD&D role-players fill the pages of this book.  One of the greatest, funniest AND weirdest \\"whodunit\\" mystery you will ever read about.  A man is murdered, a famous author, and who wished him dead?  The question should be, who DID NOT want him dead!<br />Yet, James Owens Mega, creater of the sci-fi novel, Bimbos of the Death Star, must solve the crime!

Being a lover of history, Man After Man, really is something I enjoyed.  It is about the changing face of mankind and future history, something I enjoy very much.  Many people complain that timeline and stories seemed confusing and that the artwork is not that great.  First off, I didn't find them at all confusing and the artwork was there to help the reader picture the beings that mankind have become NOT to win any awards or prizes.  Don't compare the book to others, just enjoy it.  It is NOT a serious piece of work.<br />I do wish it had been longer and had touched a little more on the changes to the other animals and the plantlife.  It would of padded out the book more.  I wanted more details!	2002-08-22

The New World Order has brought about peace, is feeding everybody and is getting things done.  Almost.<br />The Moon is helping feed the Earth (just like in many sci-fi stories) by growing food and using gravity to delivery it.  But they're getting sick of paying for the air, working under bad conditions and dealing with the corrupt colonial offcials. Not much different from 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' is there?  We even have a chees playing computer that is used to help the 'Rebels'.<br />On the other hand, there are lots of battle scenes with realistic results (such as one scene where a room full of babies are killed), leaders within the UN who are fully developed characters and a plot twist near the end.<br />The only REAL problem is the lack of a end.  I think another book was (or is) in the works.	2002-08-19

In this book he deals with the factors that brought the end of European's empires (and Non-European empires) in Asia.  He talks about Nationalism, Communism, the Great Depression and World War Two.  Cut into three parts or 'books' each chapter focuses on another empire or region of Asia. The Dutch, the English, the French, the Americans and even touches on the Japanese and their invasions.  Background is given and how the different nations dealt with their 'subjects' and their goals.  Full of history, a must for anybody interested in Asia's history or on how colonialism seems to work.  Some overlap because he has to run up and down time when moving from one part of Asia to another, but comes with a simple map and full of humor.	2002-08-19

When I first saw the book, it looked so harmless.  But the 300 plus pages are FULL of great artwork, truly amazing writing and samurai stories as good as any on the big screen (or the TV screen).  NOT for the weak of heart.  LOTS of blood and sword fighting, but also lots of great lines.  And Cub is kind of cute too.  Great bang for your buck.	2002-08-07

A book about how Japan was changing Americans NOT just on how America (and the West) was changing the Japanese.  It focuses on William E. Griffis, Edward S. Morse, and Lafcadio Hearn (whose names you will find many times within history books about Japan).  Their different writings (with their different ideas, backgrounds and view points) allow us to see how Americans responded to visiting and living within Japan.<br />I have to warn you, the book is somewhat dry(the other review compared it to A&amp;E) but worth reading for those of us who love Japanese history.	2002-08-07

The Southlands are being ruled by the xenophobic Field Marshal, Anatole Leonard, with his Army of the Southern Cross.  Against him are the Zentraedi insurgents who remain loyal to the Robotech Masters.  The rich and powerful are trying to bring back the UEG, while many of the common masses just want to get enough food to eat.  Into this mixture comes Rick Hunter, Lisa Hayes, Max and Miriya Sterling, Breeti and Dr. Lang. The threat of the Robotech Masters and the Invid seems to be always in the background, as the many forces on Earth fight over the resources that are left.	2002-08-07

This book is a much needed book for anybody interested in Japanese history.  It gives a very detailed account of the policies of the ruling class while at the same time showing the development of the large cities and their free labour market.  It shows that Japan already had a large unrban working class before the morden period.  The author also gets into the social history and the beliefs that many of the ruling class had about servants during the same period.	2002-08-07

The author brings together information and makes points with such ease that you can't help but say, &quot;I knew that.&quot;  For example-<br />&quot;What survived from MacArthur's tenure in Tokyo was what the Japanese found acceptable, and in this respect the postwar reformation was somewhat similar to the Meiji Restoration.&quot;<br />The book is full of answers to questions I had about postwar Japan.  Is greatly detailed but not overwhelming.  I'm happy I found it.	2002-07-25

I really enjoyed the novel, but I also think that while trying to tie up all the loose ends that sometimes the story is hurt.  When finishing a series you have to let some things go, so the reader goes away still wondering a tad.<br />I think the author (or authors) tried just a little to much to cover every person, event or plot line in the Robotech universe. That is why I took away one star.<br />On the other hand there was a lot of humor.  For example, a ship named N'trpriz with a Karbarran Captain named K'rrk, a science officer with horns, a female communications officer and the guy in engineering has a thick Highlander's accent!<br />&quot;The second star to the right?&quot; - Rick Hunter.	2002-07-21

In history most nations are always taking ideas and beliefs from others, even when they don't know it. Japan is no different. Much of the Far East classes in American colleges spend much of their time teaching students about where Japan gets much of its culture, language and traditions.<br />The Art of War is like everything else that came to Japan. They took it, made it Japanese and used it in the way THEY felt was best. The Art of War soon spread into areas of business and philosophy. The ideas were soon adapted and proved to be useful rules for every walk of Japanese life. It could guide a warrior or help a baker do his best.	2002-07-19

The Sentinels have escaped from Praxis and have freed Garuda, but at a price. Many of the crew, including the Hunters have been poisoned by the atmosphere of Garuda and now they go to Haydon IV, both to find the cure and to free another planet. But that might be easier said than done, as the planet is a relic that can defend itself AND the Regent is waiting for them.<br />To add to that, not only is General Edward running the REF, but the Zentraedi forces, under Breetai, have taken the last of the monopole ore, which is needed if the human forces ever wish to see Earth again!<br />While this is all going on, an important question starts to pop up again and again; WHO WAS HAYDON?<br />\\"We vowed to be your allies, but never your slaves or your victims.\\" - Breetai	2002-07-16

LaFleur gives us a book which is well made.  Piece by piece Mr. LaFleur goes over the history of abortion, buddhism, family planning, sexuality attitudes and even woman's lib in Japan.  By the time he reaches his conclusion, you can't help but feel like you, yourself, have also researched and processed all the information.<br />Near the end, when he compares the Japanese ideas to American ideas on the issue, you can't help but feel that maybe it was all a well placed trap, to get you to look at the whole mess from a different point of view, not just the pro-life/pro-choice, good/bad, yes/no, on/off American way (where every issue only has two sides and the winner gets total victory, so no mercy!)<br />You might not like some of the points made, but it will sure force you to think.	2002-07-02

Don't worry, I haven't given anything away that the cover of the book won't have.  The book is rich in details, in the mystery of Mars and its culture.  Everything you could expect from H.G.

Bolos: Book 1, is the first in a series of books based on the fighting machine created by Keith Laumer.  The idea was that tanks would develop not only better weapons and stronger hulls, but would also have computers build into them which would allow it to perform certain duties without a crew.  By the time Bolo Mark XXX was developed, human strategic thinking was no longer required.  Book 1 and the rest of the series are short stories done by some of the best, including David Drake, S.M. Stirling, Mercedes Lackey and more.  Bolos may be machines, but the ones in the stories show heart.	2002-01-27

Mr. Holm fills this book about China with amazing insight, stories of daily life and blood stirring tales about people trying to keep alive ideas that Americans have allowed to die and rot.  What do we know about freedoms?  The author shows us a nation where the people are willing to smuggle in books, learn other languages and even take in foreign ideas while living under a government that is more than willing to punish them for doing so.  A nation that treat the kids like gems and the adults like resources.  A nation that has recycled everything, from people to soil to noodles for thousands of years and will continue to do so forever.  A book not only about Chinese culture but also about American thought.	2002-01-09

OK, I know that Anita has background as a vampire hunter, but frankly a lot of the time she seems to be getting her butt kicked.  None of the vampies seem very impressed by her and her timing, when it comes to wise-cracks, could be better.  When you're down DON'T PISS PEOPLE OFF.  I also got the feeling that I was reading a book in the MIDDLE of a series, when in fact I am just getting a lot of background.  Lots and lots.  I don't mind it too much, but there seemed to be a new character every chapter that I had to absorb.  I was also left feeling kind of cheated, as I wanted to know more about a world where vampires not only have rights, but even a church!	2001-12-27

Dandelion Wine allows you to go back to the summer of 1928, a summer of dandelion wine, apple trees, new sneakers, mowed lawns and half-forgotten memories.  The book both delights me, as Bradbury is a artist when it comes to words, and also depresses me, because there is also the sorrows of things lost, including one chapter that deals with love that could never be.

The Roman Empire and the Aztec Empire are about to rumble, and it looks like Rome holds all the cards. After all, they say, the Aztec are just barbarians. But the Aztec are not as backwards as they might first seem and they are NOT going down without a fight. On top of that, they seem to have allies...<br />I loved this book, but one of the flaws was the lack of an explanation on HOW the Aztec Empire lasted so long. In our history, the Aztec people were having troubles well before the Spanish ever showed up. Also, the idea that the Aztec might be able to help feed their own people by killing and processing others for food didn't ring true. Why kill a farmer and feed a few people for a day, when a farmer can run a small farm and feed the same people for a year? I am not saying they didn't eat human flesh for other reasons, but there is no way to do it on such a scale for supporting the people of an Empire!<br />In other words, it seems like the books the author used or people who helped the author with the Aztec side of the story were using outdated ideas.	2001-09-24

Can Earth's people defend themselves when they are not even allowed to show mistrust because even THAT would be looked at as a threat under the principles they live under? Or will the cybs realize that just because the Earth seems backwards to them DOES NOT mean the demi and draffs don't have weapons of their own?<br />A book that forces you to think.

This book on the Korean War is very complete and very detailed.  The book gets down to the battalion level, getting into the battles, the cold, the terror, the heroism and the mistakes.  It even touches on the treatment of the black soldiers within the American units.  The only problem a reader might have is the amount of details. It is 1136 pages long, the first 976 pages cover the war, the last hundred or so covering sources and notes.<br />While there are few pictures, each one is powerful, no doubt carefully selected.	2001-09-15

The plot is somewhat simple, but the characters and ideas that fill the book make it a must for any lover of military science-fiction or just lovers of science fiction in general. If you like David Drake's books, try John Dalmas's books.  The setting is a fully detailed universe and this book is just the first in a long series of books which will be based in this universe.

Oh, there are battle scenes and cool artwork, but the plot is really nothing more than a way to get Alita on the path, the pathway of finding herself, good or bad, and maybe even reinventing herself. Is a person the sum of her or his memories and when their memories are lost, can they become a new person, maybe a brand new person each and every day of their lives?	2001-06-12

A book that seems to be aimed at younger readers, with no nudity, cussing and few fights (though the Keiichi does grab the Goddess Urd in a place he shouldn't at one point). The book seems to focus on the relationship between Keiichi and the Goddess Belldandy, which seems to be one the boy wishes to mature into a serious one. This is the first book and you might wish to see the reviews of the other books in the series before trying it out.

Mega-corporations run the nation, having most of the wealth and having assumed control over their employees. Now they fight against each other, using all the weapons available to gain total power over all Japan. The story focues on one such corporation developing an AI with true self-awareness. They in fact create Tokugawa, the first program with consciousness. They start training it with scenarios and ideas from Japan's past, making him into a Samurai. Little did they know how much he would need the training!<br />Don't judge by the cover.

This book has great artwork, interesting characters and a plot which will drive you mad if you skip a page by accident.  Full of humor and serious scenes, this book deals with the greatest fears and greatest gifts of mankind.  Life, what is it and do I fit the mold?  Masamune Shirow takes us on a ride, with Major Motoko Kusanagi, to answer this questions and much more.  Of course, sometimes, like in real life and trains, we get derailed and have to be put back on track, but the subplots just add to the flavor of the setting.  I loved the idea of 'Fuchikoma' and they kept me laughing.<br />The reason I think this will never be outdated is, while much of our knowledge is advancing at a very fast rate and stuff like interfaces between organic systems and computer systems is becoming more and more steamless, I don't think we will ever be able to truly answer the question 'what is life' anymore than we can define what we mean by 'artificial intelligence'.  50 years ago my watch would of freaked half of the US military and made most scientists drool. Now its something that is tossed away if it breaks!  50 years from now my computer will be looked at as lower in 'intelligence' than the kitchen table!	2001-06-08

The authors really do a great job in doing a detailed study of Neanderthals, their lives and their world. They catalogue the fossils found, examine how we know what we know from the bones, tools and even the ash from the fires.<br />The only problem is that the book was published in 1993-1994 and does not take into account later DNA tests and the four-year-old child who lived five thousand years after the last of the Neanderthals SHOULD of died (found in 1999)who showed signs of interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals. So, while the conclusion in the book that we did not come from Neanderthals may not be correct (and still open to debate), the chapters dealing in detail with Neanderthal tools, camp sites, society, art and burial are a must for people interested in the subject...	2001-04-28

Lots of photos, but few charts or timelines to help the readers.<br />People just beginning might wish to read IN SEARCH OF THE NEANDERTHALS by Christopher Stringer and Clive Gamble.  Being published in the 1993-4, it is already outdated, but most of the basic information on fossils, camp sites, food sources and stone tools are still valid, aided with maps, charts and timelines.

The problem with the book is, while the stories are either set in Japan or about Japan or have Japanese characters NONE of the authors are Japanese, so I think the book is flawed to begin with.  It would be nice to see what Japanese Sci-Fi authors write about.  After all, what we think of as the future is their present; advanced technology, over-crowding, computers in every device you can think of.  So, what do THEY think of the future, what is their vision of space and Japanese society in the 21st Century?  Well, don't look here, because this is not the book to answer the questions.

Hornblower, along with thousands of other officers and sailors, return to the Royal Navy.  He is named Commander, given a sloop of war and a first rate crew. The book is full of action, both on land and on the sea.  It also has French fish, Spanish gold and Hornblower's new bride.  You may find yourself, as I do, wondering how somebody who acts so brave out of need one second, can be so paranoid or spineless the next, but this is what makes Hornblower seem so human to me.  Even his greatest flaw, marrying a woman he has no true love for, makes him as human as you can make a character out of a book. Hornblower is no sword swinging, hard-drinking, God's-gift-to-women character.  No, Hornblower is just a seasick, I-hope-my-pants-are-on-right, I-better-write-to-my-wife character.	2001-03-24

It is set up as a series of short stories, so you can put it down and pick it up later, taking breaks between chapters without the 'flow' being broken.  Hornblower is a amazing character, with both merits and some funny flaws, like getting seasick!  His character is a balance between smarts and greed, fear of failure and a strong sense of honor.  The books follow him as he goes up the ladder of command, each book's scope getting larger and the problems he faces becoming more and more complex.<br />Other books you might enjoy, if you enjoy this series, is the 'Honor' series by David Weber (a sci-fi version of Hornblower, but pretty) and the large hardcover: Stephen Biesty's Cross-Sections Man-Of-War, which is great for understanding the ships and their crew. All the books, including the Hornblower books are something both young adults and older parents would love.	2001-03-16

The setting is well studied and the book even comes with a picture of a square-rigged ship with a legend to help you know which sail is which.  The problem comes when you get half-way through and find yourself lost, because there seems to be no plot.  I have tried TWICE to read it from start to finish and always just give up about half-way. It does not seem to keep my interest after the first few chapters. In most cases Mr. O'Brian is able to do a MUCH better job than Mr. Forester, in all but one skill: Keeping Me Interested.	2001-03-16

This is one of the only Star Trek books I come close to even liking.

It goes step by step, is easy to understand and even has review questions at the end of each chapter (along with a summary).  Lots of photos, some in color, along with figures and tables to help explain and give more details.  Great for people who want to understand the reasons people are searching for life on other planets, but also great for just understand the science of life on our planet too. All that and humor too.	2001-02-27

The book is not just about aliens and alien societies. It also deals with making proper stars and planets and what alien science might be like. Could of used more details on the subject of planet building, but there are other works that get into the nuts-and-bolts of that subject. This book touches lightly on alien culture, view points and history, not just the science of building an alien creature.  Also, some of it might be outdated with our increasing knowledge of other planets and solar systems.  It looks more and more like our idea of planet forming and how systems form might be slightly incorrect (if not out right wrong).  That is why I held back a star.	2001-02-27

The book deals with ideas about making space travel easy and colonizing space simple.  The first few chapters deal with getting out of the gravity well we call Earth with known science and equipment. The next deal with using the resources that could be found on the Moon, Mars, Mercury and even the Oort Cloud (as well as planting a few colonies here and there)with the knowledge we have and the equipment we could have soon. After that is starts to get harder to picture doing all this projects with current technology.  By chapter 8, for explain, we are dealing with terraforming and star engineering.  Near the end of the book, starting with chapter 11 we are talking about interstellar space ships and the economices of interstellar commerce.  But by than, you think all of it can be done! Each chapter helps to hold up the next one.  For example, cheap, easy ways to get into space would cut the cost of space travel and allow for the next step which is exploring the planets and finding resources to help the next step.	2001-02-26

It starts with a short history of rockets and the idea of space exploration than moves swiftly into the mid and late 20th century. The book allows you to see the huge rift between what people wanted and what governments could deliver. Its about the many sided battle between politics of leadership, military goals, dreams of a new frontier and a more limited, but maybe mature vision. It deals with the cold war, space stations, rocket ships and even the search for life in space. Any person interested in the space race between the US and the USSR or the space programs of the USA should read this book.	2001-02-25

I really love them and always thought of Cybermen as, so-so. But this book is great. The setting, the time period, the characters all really come alive. Even the feel is of a Dr WHO? TV episode. Now if they can only get the Dalek Novels to be this good, but frankly, this is the only Dr. WHO Novel that I have had so far that is right up there, in plot and charcters, with a Dr. WHO?

This is the first book of a still growing series. Short stories, many of them linked by events or characters, showing the Man-Kzin Wars, how they started and who won them. A lot of the stories also deal with the Kzin alone, as many of the later stories DO show how the Kzin became a space-traveling race of warriors. Many of the shorts have been collected into full novels. Get the whole series. Some stories you can't help but read again and again, yet a few I can't re-read because I feel pity or even pain at some of the endings. Remember, the stories are about war and some of the author's hold nothing back, with very realistic plots and battle scenes.	2001-02-23

Inherit the Stars is a classic and the series is fun to read.  Mr. Hogan loves his plot twists and also enjoys making real characters, with all the flaws and merits that are linked to man.

Timothy Zahn is best when using his own ideas, settings, characters and plots.  He can make them say and do anything he wants without worrying about limites placed on the work by others.

Friedman creates the best settings and cultures.  She designs great, realistic characters and a flowing plot that pulls you along.  A mixture of sci-fi and fantasy, with magic and spring loaded weapons.  And,like most of her books, good and evil seems to be hard to define.  The characters seem realistic, yet above the norm. Strong, yet they show flaws all the time. Great cover and the best book to start with if you have not 'absorbed' one of her books before.	2001-02-20

One star taken away because at heart I am a fan of HARD Sci-fi and a few things just keep bugging me.  Like a alien drink that tastes like coffee to the humans.  Or the fact they could all eat the same food.  But Lisanne Norman is good enough at everything else, so you are willing to let that go.  In other words, if you are not forgiving and demand your HARD sci-fi with out FTL ships and aliens who don't look like anything on Earth, DON'T get this book.  If you like a good story and don't mind a few rules being bent, at least try the first book in the series and than decide.  The books get bigger and better in the rest of the series.	2001-02-19

The idea of a group of volunteers fighting the Japanese fighters and bombers with their P-40s was amazing to me.  Not many history classes in high school or even college touched on the subject. If you enjoyed this book, I would also read 'Red Tails Black Wings' by John B. Holway.  Did you know when the Red Tails got their new P-40s, the man who helped them learn how to handle the aircraft was a veteran pilot from the Flying Tigers, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Cochran?	2001-02-17

While other books focus on what the Romans are doing, she examines why they do it.  She breaks it down into parts, dealing with how the army, the empire's income and the Roman values shape and mold how they respond to threats and outsiders. The hardcover might scare you, but it only took me two days to read and for a person who has a basic knowledge of Roman History, the book should not be a problem.	2000-09-24

Luttwak helps you to understand the goals and stragtegy used to reach those goals by the Romes who DID not want to spend all their money and manpower  on defending their frontier, YET still wanted some kind of defenese, which  would to be flexible enough to handle both raiders and full scale  invasions.  Makes a lot of sense.  It is a tad dry, as one reviewer pointed  out and you might not agree with all the view points, but if you are  interested in the Roman Empire, this is a book to think about.	2000-01-20

This book makes you feel that Xena and Gabby are friends and that Xena is developing as a character (with emotions towards other people), not just a paper-cut-out of a warrior.	1999-09-01

Sure, the book is a tad long, but when you realize Berserkers are fighting each other, you want to know WHY! The answer is worth the wait.	1999-05-17

Time seems to have no meaning, as your point of view changes in both time and space, like a bad Doctor Who movie. Sometimes  I don't know what character I am reading about.  I happen to be a great fan  and even sent him e-mail once, but this book could of been A LOT better if  somebody else had gone over it with a magic marker and helped him cut out  parts that were not needed.	1999-05-17

Men have been trying to defeat Berserkers for thousands of years.  Has one man, in trying to escape from his enemies, found the control code? Can he, instead of just saving his life, use the  Berserkers to bring himself back into power?	1999-05-17

Not only is it hard to follow, but I truly have no idea if they got Shiva or not!  I happen to be a great fan and have all the books and stories, but  I have to say, Mr. Saberhagen may wish to pass on the series to another  writer.	1999-03-24

It is not just a series of events, linked like a chain, cause and effect, cause and effect, but a WEB.  Of characters, events, ideas.  In order to just read it, you have to think and understand the links.  If you don't want to think, better not TRY to even read the first page. Even time is just a few strands in the web.	1998-01-14
