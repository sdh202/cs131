My family just came back from the Smokies a month ago and I happened to bring back this little book. One thing you should know about me is that I try to buy a couple of books on the region of the country that we are visiting. This was one of them. I am intrigued by the history of the places I visit. The Smokies is definitely one place that we are going back to.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating look at life in the mountains. It is not your stereotypical book either ~~ these women are magnificent women and the author brings their stories to life just by describing their daily routines, their beliefs and how life in the mountains were lived. Their lives were not easy ~~ and nor were they idle. But they were not complainers ~~ and obviously it worked for them as they stayed in the mountains fourteen years or so after the Smokies became a national park.  <br /> <br />This book is packed with tidbits of history and some of their superstitions. It is full of information on how they survived off the land ~~ just like the Indians, they made use of just about everything they either grow or made. The author told of how they courted among themselves, how they entertained one another (with stories by the fireplace, dances and music and church-goings ~~ even chores were oftentimes excuses to get together and visit), and how they survived in the wilderness without doctors or hospitals nearby. <br /> <br />If you are looking for something that reminds you of your ancestors' lives, this is a great book to pick up! It is a slim volume but it is packed full of interesting tidbits. It gives you an idea of just how hard life can be in those days and sometimes, how much more richer it really was.  <br /> <br />10-12-05	2005-10-13

I just bought these books three days ago and have finished them all. Mollenkopf needs to write more!!! I am from the Black Swamp area of Ohio ~~ and I remember the tales of my childhood when my father told me stories of how big the trees used to be before civilization came along and drained the Black Swamps. However, I have to clarify that I am from the southwestern part of the Black Swamp, which to my disappointment, is not featured very much in his Black Swamp books. Never mind ~~ I live in Defiance now and have traveled back and forth to Toledo ~~ so some of the landmarks he's talking about is in this book and I am familiar with them.  <br /> <br />If you are a history buff ~~ this is a great book for you to read about this area of the country. If you like Ohio history or even American history ~~ this book is definitely for you! It starts back in the beginning with Anthony Wayne's fight against the British and the Indians and end with Charles Dicken's visit to Ohio. All these little stories ~~ beautifully written and easy to read ~~ makes you long for more stories. These stories remind me of sitting at my dad's knee and listening to the stories of days yonder. In today's frantic world, it is hard to imagine what the world used to be. This book offers a glimpse of a quieter but harsher life. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for any serious reader! It's hard put down! <br /> <br />10-12-05	2005-10-12

Like I mentioned in his other reviews ~~ I cannot put his books down. I will be honest ~~ when I bought these books, I didn't think I was going to enjoy them as much as I do!! In fact, once I read his Civil War book, I knew that the books on the Black Swamp history will be impossible to put down. I was right. I didn't do anything for two days ~~ till I could finish these books! <br /> <br />Mollenkopf writes with passion and with beauty as he puts forth old stories that speaks volume of our ancestors that once trodded upon these paths in the Black Swamps. He shares many interesting stories ~~ from anti-slavery (Laura Haviland and her abolitionist views), to the first time a Steam Locomotive came into the area, to the last day of the Canal days. Yes, we Ohioans are famous for going to festivals (Canal Days anyone? The Grand Rapid Apple Butter Festival?) ~~ and yes, we put on historic stages to remember the past ~~ but these books are really wonderful for bringing the stories alive even more.  <br /> <br />If I was an Ohio History teacher, I would definitely encourage my students to read these books! The stories are short enough to keep anyone's attention and long enough to inspire you to read more on the topic. These books are not huge historical volumes ~~ but they're truly a gem!! I am definitely going to encourage my boys to read these books when they're old enough ~~ and I hope to visit all those landmarks that he has mentioned! <br /> <br />10-12-05	2005-10-12

I will be the first to admit that I just love these Fiction For the Way We Live series ~~ and this one is definitely one of the best books of this fall!! I have been in a reading slump for a long time ~~ and this book really took me out of it and into a different world. I just love it!! <br /> <br />This book is set in the Lowcountry region between Georgia and South Carolina. The Gullah proverb: \\"If you don't know where you are going, you should know where you came from\\" is the basis of this book. Meridy Dresden finds herself at loose ends when her son, BJ, is off at college and her husband, Beau, is immersed in a trial that he has been working on for over two years. Meridy takes a trip home to Seaboro and not only was it a trip home, it was a journey to rediscover that young vibrant girl that she feared had died along with her best friend who died tragically the night they graduated from high school.  <br /> <br />Tulu, her former housekeeper and part nanny, shared with Meridy proverbs about the Gullah culture and shared with her some stories to help Meridy find her way back to having peace within her heart. Meridy embarks on that journey with fear and trepidation after all, it could ruin everything she has worked very hard for. <br /> <br />This book is written with lyrical prose and lovely scene-writing ~~ it makes me keep coming back for more. It was a soothing read too ~~ in today's frantic world, this book set a slower pace and made me sit and relax. It is about a woman embarking on self-discovery, her relationship with her mother and sister, best friend and husband. It is enlightening read and very emotional in spots. It is a book that I would recommend to everyone who loves reading this kind of book. It's perfect for those long dark winter nights ahead ~~ the book is set in summer and the warmth of the novel will linger long after the last page has been turned. <br /> <br />10-10-05	2005-10-11

I am a native of Northwest Ohio and I am ashamed to say that I do not know much about the history of my region. I also have never read much on the history of Civil War except on the big battles that have been written about ~~ Gettysburg and Fredericksburg and so on. I never really paid attention in school (if the teachers did even mention it) regarding the Civil War soldiers from our area.  <br /> <br />Just by chance the other day at a festival that a little town in Ohio, Grand Rapids, hold every October, my family and I walked by this author's booth. My father bought this book. (I bought the other three books by this author because my interest in the Great Black Swamp area has been ignited by a series of newspaper articles a few years' back.)  <br /> <br />My dad read this book in three hours. I wasn't so lucky ~~ I do have two preschoolers ~~ but I managed to read it in two days. This is a very slim volume but it is full of historical tidbits about Civil War fighters from the Northwestern Ohio. It is full of emotion as the author compiled stories from old letters and poems written during this time. It is full of pictures. Every story in this book is a complete story. It is written very concisely and beautifully ~~ each character's voice was portrayed in a vivid way. In short, this book is a testament to heroes who just happened to live in a turblent time and did the best they could in their circumstances. It is a testament to those who have marched off to war and never returned home. This book has ignited a spark of interest on my behalf on the Civil War in the Cumberland Gap and other places in Tennessee and Kentucky as Sherman marched his way to Atlanta.  <br /> <br />If you are from Ohio ~~ even if you aren't! ~~ I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a Civil War or History buff. This book is a delightful addition to any American history student's library ~~ it is not boring (like too many history books are) and it is interesting. It is also a proud testament to the heroes from my part of the country ~~ these men are just ordinary men in extraordinary times ~~ and this book is exactly that! <br /> <br />10-11-05	2005-10-11

I will admit that I am not familiar with biology, deep-sea research and the boating terms in this book! However, this is a fast-paced suspense novel that has kept me on the edge of my seat. Sometimes, it's too fast-paced and too confusing for me to follow ~~ which is why this is a four stars instead of a five-stars. I enjoyed the ride though! <br /> <br />Ben Anderson, Haley's mentor and friend, is missing and Haley is on the run for her life. Ben had apparently discovered something and a ruthless corporation is on the run after him. Haley and Sam Wintripp, a covert operative whose shadowy past can help her find Ben and the secret he's been hiding from Haley. Little did Haley and Sam know just how devastating this secret would be if it fell in the wrong hands ~~ just as it threatens to do throughout the book. Sam and Haley couldn't trust anyone ~~ not even the local law force since it was taken over by a rogue cop who framed several murders on them.  <br /> <br />If there is a movie based on this book, I know that my husband and I would watch it ~~ it's a perfect action flick ~~ and this book is just as suspenseful as it would be in the theaters. If you have a bit of time and would like to read a novel that you just can't put down ~~ I would recommend this one! <br /> <br />10-5-05	2005-10-06

After reading Too Deep for Tears and All We Hold Dear, I opened this book with anticipation. It did not disappoint me. This time, the story focuses on the Rose women ~~ Mairi, Aisla, Alanna and Ena, Aisla's daughter with Ian Fraser. And this time, my questions about Lian and Genevra have been answered as their stories after leaving the Glenn have been told. It's a relief to have those two back in the book again!  <br /> <br />Ena is a young girl soon to be a woman ~~ she's on the edge of childhood and womanhood and a lot of the story focuses on her and the choices she had to make. Aisla is still grieving for Ian, her love of her life and Alanna is disappointed because she has only one child ~~ she longs for more children to fill her home. Together, they live in peace with Mairi in the center. Drawn home after sixteen years of living elsewhere, Genevra and Lian came to visit. All of these women ~~ bound together by blood relations and by grief have learned the simple fact that united ~~ no one can break them.  <br /> <br />It is a beautiful novel ~~ oftentimes too wordy (and sometimes, repetitive in passages) ~~ it draws the Rose women back into your imagination and their stories they tell are still very powerful. The reason why it's a four stars instead of a five ~ too wordy. I find myself getting impatient with a lot of the drawn-out scenes ~~ and find myself skipping ahead. That is my only complaint about this wonderful novel!! <br /> <br />This is a perfect book for those long autumn nights ahead ~~ so enjoy it! <br /> <br />10-1-05	2005-10-02

Once I managed to get past the first few chapters, I found this book to be as wonderful as the first one, Too Deep for Tears. The first few chapters just seem to be dragging on ~~ with Eva running off into the ocean because of her \\"darkness\\" that is growing inside her. Everything seemed to have been handed to her on a silver platter ~~ adoring parents, wonderful fiance, best friends and she couldn't seem to appreciate any of it. I had to put the book aside for several weeks before I could get back to it.  <br /> <br />Once I got back into it, it picked up quickly. My favorite characters will always be Alanna and Aisla and their family and friends. I still adore Ian, from the first book. This book wraps up a mystery between Ian and Aisla ~~ and Alanna finds great love too. She falls in love with David, Ian's nephew. After their wedding, comes a great tragedy for the glenn. And a great victory at a great price. <br /> <br />Eva set off on a search for her birth mother, following all the clues she had left behind. Along the way, she finds a glimmer of her true self and rediscovered her dreams. It is a magical time in her life.  <br /> <br />This book is a wonderful addition for Too Deep For Tears. The only regret I have is that it didn't mention much on Aisla's sisters ~~ their stories were told so vividly in Too Deep for Tears that I would love to hear more on them.  <br /> <br />So if you can get past the first few chapters ~~ this book will be worth your while. It takes you back into a magical past and dreams. It's a great escape from this world sometimes! <br /> <br />9-16-05	2005-09-17

This is my second Michael Palmer novel and it's really suspenseful ~~ but do have to admit that it did drag on a bit in the middle of the book. But other than that, I couldn't put it down! <br /> <br />Zach Iverson moved back to Sterling, New Hampshire, his hometown, to take his place at the hospital there. His brother, Frank, runs the hospital and their father, Judge, is a promient figure in town. Zach looks forward to being home but little did he know that he would be in the middle of an intrigue that crossed all boundaries. It started out innocently enough when Zach treated a little boy who kept having flashbacks to nightmares and no one knew what it was. Determined to find a cure for his little patient, Zach got in the thick of things and found out that there was a conspiracy running amok at the hospital and people didn't seem to be who they are.  <br /> <br />It is thrilling, bizarre, and creepy. This one is more of a political thriller ~~ politics among doctors and nurses and administrators are not always pleasant and this book portrayed that very well. Sometimes greed gets in the way and sometimes honor takes a step in and makes things right. It's an interesting book! <br /> <br />If you're new to Palmer, I would recommend this one too! If you're not new to Palmer and haven't read this one ~~ this one will be just as enjoyable as his others! <br /> <br />8-19-05	2005-08-20

My mom borrowed this book from a friend (my mom never reads horror!) and when she visited for the weekend, she was busy reading it so she can finish it to loan it to me! I haven't read John Saul since high school (you don't need to know how many years ago that was!). My husband, again, was flabberghasted that I haven't read this one, so I picked it up and read it in a day and a half. WOW!  <br /> <br />This is creepy and it's a book that you can't put down since you want to know what happens next. I was up pretty late reading it ~~ I just had to know if my suspicions were correct (some of them were and some of them were so far off that I was surprised!). It's well-written and even though it was written over 20 years ago, the plot still remains current.  <br /> <br />Sally Montgomery refuses to believe her perfectly healthy baby girl died of SIDS and set off to find out the answers. She joins the ranks of another young mom whose son had disappeared. Together they found out something so horrorifying that it just didn't seem real ~~ but it was real and it was affecting the children in their town and in their families. They believed that there is a conspiracy going on but no one else believes them till it was too late.  <br /> <br />And it definitely will give you chills on your spines as Saul writes so plausibly here. It just preys on your worst nightmare ~~ and it's definitely a suspenseful read! It's a perfect read for anytime of the year, especially in the dog days of summer! <br /> <br />8-14-05	2005-08-15

From the first page to the last ~~ the writer keeps the reader enthralled with the story-line of a famous painter who ends up falling in love with the baker's daughter. By a chance encounter Raphael Sanzio, the Pope's favorite artist, meets Margherita, who was just taking in some fresh air while babysitting her nephew. Margherita was to be his newest inspiration for his Madonna paintings.  <br /> <br />This is their love story ~~ through tribulations and trials, through Raphael's enemies who wanted to be the pope's favorite or who just wanted to get rid of Margherita because they feared that she's in the way of Raphael's paintings, and through the gossip of the courts. It is a lovely story of two people who fought everyone in society to remain together even when promises of marriage has been denied.  <br /> <br />The story was written in the lavish times of the Italian Papal courts where Pope Leo was the pope, Michangelo has been banned from the Vatican to work in Florence, and intrigue swarms around the young couple ~~ it is beautifully written and the descriptions of the paintings are vivid enough for the reader to imagine them. <br /> <br />If you're new to historical fiction, I would highly recommend starting with this book ~~ it's simple enough to keep the main characters straight without getting confused to the lineage of the families. It's wonderful enough to get the reader immersed in the descriptions of the Italian courts and in the descriptions of who wears what. It's a fun book to read too. If you're a historical fiction buff, this book is for you too ~~ it's not as elaborate as some of the other historical fiction writers' books, but it's just as wonderful!

My husband, a noted fan of sci-fi, was flabberghasted that one) I had never heard of War of the Worlds and two), never read the book. So after seeing the movie (which did scare me half to death, btw), he dragged me to the nearest bookstore to get a copy of this book. The book did not scare me as much as the movie did ~~ but it's still incredibly scary especially when you consider that this book was written in 1898. Wow!<br /><br />While the movie deviates from the book in some things, it does a classic job of telling the book. The book is very descriptive of the machines that have taken over London and her suburbs. It is descriptives of the Martians and provides very vivid narrative of the fear of people running to save their lives. The narrator tells a wonderful story ~~ but it's not one to relish over a cup of tea. It's one story that you can just imagine people hovering over a campfire hearing the terrors of a world under attack from beings from another planet. It's a classic ghost story and what makes it so scary is, that it's plausible.<br /><br />This is a definite addition to my classics library ~~ and knowing my husband, this will be a book that he'll urge our sons to read someday. This is a book that has withstood the tests of time ~~ with vivid imagination and wonderful story-telling ~~ of people from the planet Mars.<br /><br />8-4-05	2005-08-04

This is an engrossing novel filled with twists and turns that it leaves the reader anxious to know what happened till the final page has been turned. Even then, the story still haunts the reader. <br /> <br />This novel focuses on four friends ~ Kristina, a beautiful basketball player, Conni, her former roommate, Jim, her boyfriend and Albert, Conni's boyfriend. Kristina is found dead and the novel focuses on the unraveling of secrets among the four friends. It is a chilling portrayal of three human beings who are indifferent to the fact that their friend is dead. It's a creepy novel ~~ with dark undertones. The dark undertones has to do with apathy and indifference of another human being's plight in life or in Kristina's case, death. Cossetted and spoiled, these undergraduates in a priviledged college fought the investigator in the murder case in his attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding Kristina's death.  <br /> <br />This book will creep you out ~~ it will annoy you because Simons shows the worst of human nature. It will leave you twisting in your seat as you think of one scenario or another till you are ended up with surprises that you didn't think of. It is a riveting book ~~ perfect for those lazy summer days at the beach or sitting in your hammock.

This book literally kept me on the edge of my seat for the three days it took me to read! I don't care if the characters jumped around ~~ to me, that adds to the excitement and the suspense of the book.

He is then approached by a secret society to be called on to do something unusual on occassion ~~ but Eric refused to do so. He meets Laura as she hands out flyers of her missing brother.

There is Tessa, who is suffering from her daughter's death three years prior, Nancy, Tessa's mom, who has her own regrets and secrets and Helen, Nancy's mom and Tessa's grandma, who is filled with her own regrets over life. At the beginning of the book, the three come together to clean up the old farm house that has belonged in Helen's family for years ~~ disgruntled and unhappy with one another and with being there. As the book progresses, each of the women come to face to face with their own demons and broken dreams ~~ and finding solace with one another as they never have before. They share their dreams and stories over a quilt that Helen had started to make for her wedding bed, only to end up on Tessa's bed in childhood after Nancy finished it.  <br /> <br />If you're a mother, grandmother, daughter ~~ this book will speak to your heart like very few books do! The quilts in this book are so wonderfully described and your fingers ache to make quilts of your own. It is an appealing book that speaks of relationships among women that only women can understand. This is a book of broken hearts and dreams and finding the joy that only those who have suffered can understand. It's a wonderful inspiring little book ~~ and it reminds me why I really enjoy reading Emilie Richards' books.

It is a fun novel to read ~~ almost playful in parts ~~ but it's not the best historical novel or suspense I have read. It's just fun and interesting to read about the backstabbing among the royalties in England and France ~~ and about the Knights Templars as well.  <br /> <br />Alais, who once was a ward of Eleanor, was asked by Eleanor to retrieve some letters from the Canterbury Catheral buried there years ago. Alais was bored being at the French court ~~ and this is her story, past and present. She once was close to Eleanor and was once engaged to be married to Richard, The Lion Heart. However, Alais never married Richard and never saw Eleanor again after a royal dispute between Eleanor and Henry II.  <br /> <br />It may be a leisurely read ~~ it's perfect for those lazy afternoons that comes once in awhile. It is full of historical tidbits and royalty stories. It is a fun read ~~ if you don't take everything in the book literally. If you're looking for a history read, this book wouldn't be it.

Desperate to keep her life, Christy turns to Luke, a blond lawyer who really is a FBI agent uncover tracking her.  <br /> <br />With all these intrigues surrounding Christy, it makes for a fun novel. However, it is slightly predictable and if you're looking for a meatier read ~~ this book would not be it. It's just a fun book to read on a hot summer day while being lazy. So take it to the beach or swing on your hammock ~~ either way, it's a great way to pass the time. <br /> <br />7-7-05	2005-07-07

My parents are devoted fans of John Rosemond's columns ~~ and every other week, I'll get the column from them in the mail. Rosemond offers practical advice to parents like my husband and me. Bewildered by all the parenting advice out there, there are just some days we get so overwhelmed on whether we're raising our sons right or not. This book is for you if you are in the same boat as we are.<br /><br />This book just offers advice from Rosemond as he parents his children with his wife. This is practical advice and full of common sense. Though our boys are just turning three, this book will be a huge help for us over the years. We're gleaning ideas from this book now, especially on the advice of making our marriage our top priority. A happy marriage makes for a happy family.<br /><br />Each chapter also comes with real-to-life questions from other parents and Rosemond answers each one of them. These are situations that you may or may not find yourself in but you can relate to them. The answers are not mean or cruel ~~ just practical. Rosemond also stresses teaching kids responsibility and working for things that they feel are important to them. He also stresses on the importance of making time for your marriage, family time and so on.<br /><br />This is a practical guide that I heartily recommend for all parents ~~ no matter how old your children are. This is another book that I plan to give to my children and nieces and nephews when they start raising their own families.<br /><br />7-6-05	2005-07-07

As a mom of toddler twin boys (now preschoolers!) ~~ I can relate to the frustrations of raising two ornery boys and this book offers practical advice for all moms (and me included) in dealing with anger and the guilt of feeling the anger. This is a book I wish I had when they were infants ~~ because then I would know that I am just a normal mom sometimes overwhelmed with the demands of parenting in today's society.  <br /> <br />This is a humorous book ~~ and written from a Christian perspective. I did not find this book preachy ~~ just inspirational and helpful. It is also a reminder that we are not alone as moms in this world ~~ sometimes we tend to forget that and keep all of our guilt and fear bottled up inside. Society puts pressure on us as women to do it all and we don't dare admit that our children are driving us nuts. Barnhill reminds us that it is ok ~~ we are normal for getting angry. However, she also offers practical suggestions on how to deal with those angry moments so we don't hurt ourselves and our children. She offers practical warning signs of when we're going to blow and how to defuse that lighted fuse. Some of these advice I have already practiced and some are new for me ~~ and they help.  <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this book to every mom ~~ no matter how old your children are. It is just chock full of practical advice, humorous stories and inspirational ones too. It is a gentle reminder to us moms that it is ok to admit that you need help sometimes and that it's ok to admit that your beloved angels are sometimes just not so angelic. It's a great resourceful book ~~ one that I am glad that I have in my possession today! <br /> <br />7-6-05	2005-07-07

If there is a book that you can't put down this summer, hopefully, you will find this one to be that one! The Historian was recommended to me by the book staff at an Ohio Borders' store and with a big discount ~~ I picked it up. I had read the mixed reviews here at Amazon ~~ and thought, well, everyone has their own ideas of suspenseful historical books ~~ and in my opinion, this one is definitely one of the best. <br /> <br />The narrator did a wonderful job of narrating three story lines at one time. I never found it confusing, nor did I ever find it boring. I was enthralled with the search for Vlad's tomb. The main character, Rossi, a professor, who went all over the Balkan region to pick up the clues to find out where Dracula was buried or even if he was buried. Paul, his student and successor, retraced the steps that Rossi traveled and went even further than his mentor did ~~ along with the help of a graduate student who is his mentor's unacknowledged daughter, Helen. Helen was born in Eastern Europe and had grown up with the legends of that region. Together, Paul and Helen retraced Rossi's steps to find him fearing that he had died ~~ or trying to prevent him from his certain death. Together they stumble on lots of clues that Rossi hasn't even known about. And the mystery deepens as they traveled further in the Balkan area ~~ shrouded in beauty and in the mists of time and in legends. They had to discover what is real and what is legend.  <br /> <br />It was beautifully narrated ~~ and beautifully told. The story had its dark moments and tales, but it isn't blood-thirsty, which is what I really like. It weaves together past history and the present in a lyrical way that the reader is never confused as to where she/he is in the story. And the suspense was craftily built ~~ to keep the pages turning. I didn't have one disappointing moment in this book ~~ I am pleased with all of it ~~ and hope that Kostova will write another one soon! This is definitely the bestread so far for me this summer! <br /> <br />7-5-05	2005-07-05

I love reading Jude Deveraux's books ~~ I can count on her to carry me away into a different time and land ~~ better than any other Calagon moment! <br /> <br />This book, however, is not her best. While it is an entertaining read ~~ I felt that she rushed through the ending too quickly and wrapped it up nice and neatly. That is why I rated this book a three. <br /> <br />Aria was kidnapped and thrown overboard to die. However, she was rescued by J.T. Montgomery, an official with the Navy. He didn't believe her story that she is a princess of a small European kingdom, but he turned her over to the US goverment for safe-keeping, thinking he was done. That was just the beginning of a temptous love-affair.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a fun book to read this summer, this book would be it.  <br /> <br />6-20-05	2005-06-20

I read it in two days ~~ if I wasn't a mom or a housewife, I'd read it sooner than that since it kept me in its grip!  <br /> <br />Laurel Scanton moved home to her grandmother's plantation home called Mimosa Grove ~~ and found to her delight for the first time in her life, being accepted for who she is, in spite of her special \\"gift.\\" She has the gift of sight ~~ an ability passed down to the eldest daughter of each generation. When she moved home, she discovered more history to her gift than she has ever realized.

If you like to read Christian-inspired novels and if you also like to read historical novels, this book is for you! This book compiles four novels of four young couples at the beginning of the 1800s ~~ when Ohio is a new statehood. It is set in the surrounding areas of Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio.  <br /> <br />The three sisters, Kate, Annabelle and Claire, all were orphaned at an early age when their parents were killed by Indian raiders. They were taken in by Mattie, who has secrets of her own. The first three novels talk about Kate, Annabelle and Claire ~~ and their relationships with certain men in their lives. The fourth novel is focused on Claire's stepson, Dr. David Wheeler who falls in love with one of the city's foremost workers, Josephine Cline. Their story happens 30 years later.  <br /> <br />The stories are sweet and simple ~~ any teenager who loves to read love stories can read these. There are no explicit scenes in the book ~~ and every woman is unique in her own way. They all are Christian and the book is written like Beverly Lewis' books ~~ Christian and beautiful.  <br /> <br />I found it interesting since I have lived around the cities they have mentioned in this book and it's nice to be able to read of some historical facts on Ohio.  <br /> <br />This is a perfect book for any woman who wants to escape for awhile in a different time and world.  <br /> <br />6-20-05	2005-06-20

After all, it just sounds depressing in the blurb jacket itself ~~ a fiftyish woman who has never married and is a nurse with just a dog as her best companion ~~ ends up taking care of her high school secret flame ~~ it just sounds depressing. But I've heard so many positive things about Berg's writing (and I have read \\"Open House\\" and \\"Talk Before Sleep\\") ~~ so I thought I'd give it a try.  <br /> <br />And I found that I couldn't put the book down. Myra's story just captured my imagination ~~ so much so that I find myself relating to her loneliness and fears. Then when she finds herself taking care of Chip, a high school classmate ~~ and the lessons he taught her ~~ as well as her other patients who showed Myra that she does matter to people in this world ~~ it struck a chord in my heart. I didn't find that sappy at all ~~ no, I found myself wishing secretly that people would feel that way about me!  <br /> <br />I would rate this book a five if it wasn't for the last few chapters where it felt hurried to its conclusion. Other than that, this is a wonderful book with a wonderful story to share. The characters, especially Myra and Chip, are drawn from real life ~~ and I relate to them as a reader having known other people who faced their last days in fear or in acceptance. The subject matter isn't easy to read ~~ but in this book, it didn't seem to matter as much. I would recommend this one for other readers who enjoy a good story. I definitely will read more of Berg's books from now on! <br /> <br />6-6-05	2005-06-07

A friend of mine gave me her other copy of this book since she was raving about it in a bookclub recently. After reading the first ten pages, I was hooked. This is definitely one of the classic romantic novels that should be placed at the top of every reader's list. This book is just beautiful and romantic and full of interesting tidbits about Scotland, China and India. This book literally swept me away into the past! <br /> <br />This story focuses on three extraordinary women fathered by the same man, Charles Kittridge, though they all have different mothers. Aisla Rose is the oldest ~~ her mother is the only one married to Charles before he left Scotland. Aisla gave up her dream of true love to be with another man who offered her more promises than she could find in the Scottish glens. Li-An is a proud and beautiful Chinese woman who is despised since she has blue eyes ~~ she gave up everything before finding her dreams. And there is Generva, who was abandoned by her mother and Charles as a young girl in India. These are their stories ~~ love found and lost, poetry, art and music ~~ all interwoven into tales that linger long after the last page has been turned. These three women and their mothers are strong women who face the future with courage and pride. <br /> <br />This book is fascinating and exotic ~~ lovely and sometimes too beautiful to bear. It's a perfect escape for anyone who needs a break from the grind of daily life. If you're going on vacation somewhere and you need a book to read ~~ I highly recommend this one! If you're sitting around the house trying to keep cool (or warm in the winter) ~~ this is one book for you. It literally will sweep you away into times past.  <br /> <br />6-6-05	2005-06-06

Several of my online reading friends highly recommended this one and I was surprised that I haven't read it since I have made it a point to read all of Binchy's books (I have a couple left now to find and read). One of the online reading buddies strongly recommended this book as it was her favorite book.  <br /> <br />This book is about Claire O'Brien, one of the numerous O'Brien children ~~ her parents own a shop in Castlebay, Ireland. This is a small town that is also a small resort in the summertime ~~ that is when they get their best business ~~ from the tourists. Claire is one of the two daughters ~~ her sister, Chrissie, is more flamboyant and outgoing than Claire is. Claire was just bound and determined to move out of Castlebay and see the world. Angela O'Hara is her teacher with her own secrets. David Power, the doctor's son, is a distant friend of Claire ~~ even though he is older, his life has always been entwined with Claire's life ~~ they ended up in Dublin during his medical residency and her undergraduate studies. There is Gerry Doyle, the good-looking photographer's son, who took over the business when his father died of cancer. All of their stories are entwined as only lives in small towns are known to be.  <br /> <br />This is one of Binchy's older books and it is very well-written. She has a way of capturing your imagination and taking you down a path to a different life in the same small-townness of our lives. The characters are familiar to you and to me ~~ because they are based on realistic people. Their stories are comforting because they are familiar. This book is definitely a good read ~~ one I would recommend this summer to read wherever you are. <br /> <br />6-2-05	2005-06-02

This book is explosive in a positive way ~~ it is uplifting, encouraging and enlightening.  <br /> <br />I have to admit when I read the first page, I thought yeah, yeah, this book isn't talking about me. WRONG. This book is definitely for me and it's one that I will never loan to another person till my kids are grown up ~~ then I'll give it to their wives to read. I will need this book for years to come ~~ it offers practical advice, spiritual guidance based on the Biblical scriptures ~~ and stories about other moms who went through the same stuff I am now going through.  <br /> <br />This book offers solutions and advice ~~ but in a gentle loving way. This book tells you a Mom Myth (like you have to be perfectly made-up at all times) and a Mom Reality (yeah right ~~ real moms are known to wear their PJs all day long) ~~ and it helps alleviate the pressure that moms might be feeling.  <br /> <br />Speaking for myself ~~ I am a mom that has high expectations of myself. I expect my house to be spotless, my children perfectly mannered at all times, and I have great food on the table every day. Well, the reality is: the dog will stick his nose on my perfectly clean windows five minutes after I just washed them; the kids will have a bad day five days in a row; my meals may consist of take-out and the laundry is piling up, the telephone's ringing off the hook and all I want to do is hide. That is my reality. These two authors helped me to realize that it's ok. It's normal. I am normal. I am a Real Mom.  <br /> <br />They have funny stories in there as well ~~ they help find the humor in sticky situations and they offer a reminder ~~ these kids of yours will never stay young. One of these days they will move out and you'll have your perfectly spotless house again ~~ wishing for the sticky fingerprints on the walls again if it means that they'll say I love you one more time.  <br /> <br />The authors also offer encouragement through their messages. They are not overly spiritual in this book ~~~ but just right to remind you that you're not alone in the struggle of Motherhood.  <br /> <br />This is a book I consider a gem ~~ and every time someone tells me they are having a hard time with their kids ~~ this is the book I would give them to read. It can be a life-line in those crazy days. It's one that I know that I'll read over and over again.  <br /> <br />5-24-05	2005-05-25

I wish I had this book before my boys turned two ~~ then I would have grabbed it every chance I needed a good laugh! Now that my twin boys are almost three, I can have a good chuckle out of Lisa's stories ~~ I've been there!  <br /> <br />This book is a slim volume of laughs, inspiration and encouragements. It's a realistic look at life of being a mom ~~ but it's not depressing. It's not a depressing look at motherhood or life with kids ~~ it's an uplifting book with the author's stories meant to let you know that you're not alone in the midst of all the messy messes that your children hands you. Lisa shares some frank stories about toddlerhood and a few stories about teenage years. She urges you to laugh at life ~~ it's all in how you look at it. =0)  <br /> <br />If you know that someone is expecting a baby or someone is right smack in the middle of kiddie crisis ~~ I recommend you give this book for that mom. She'll sit there and laugh and cry and know that she's not alone. There are some passages on Johnson's faith ~~ but it's done in a loving way ~~ to encourage us moms to look outside of ourselves and count our miracles.  <br /> <br />I am forever grateful for my friend who lent me her copy ~~ I actually had a chance to sit down and laugh at the absurdity of child-raising and it gave me more strength to go on another day with my lovable boys. This is one of the best gifts anyone can give to a mom! <br /> <br />5-15-05	2005-05-16

I was born with some hearing and over the years I started to lose more and more of it. And while I was growing up, there were talk about the Deaf Culture and hearing impairment. I have never been a part of the Deaf Culture. I probably never will be. At my dad's urging and recommendation, I read this book.  <br /> <br />This book is a compilation of the Deaf Culture history ~~ how sign language came into being, the Deaf Clubs that were so popular till the 1960s, the Deaf Schools, and how they are fighting to perserve their heritage. It is a slim volume packed with interesting facts and observations ~~ I couldn't put the book down.  <br /> <br />This book is bound to be controversial among cicles ~~ both hearing and in the Deaf Culture. This is the first I've heard of the authors too ~~ and I may be interested enough to read their other books to get more of an idea of what their philosophies are and so on. It is very well-written, thought-provoking and interesting. It is disturbing in some parts and in other parts, it leaves the reader with more questions than answers.  <br /> <br />If you are interested in the history of the Deaf Culture, this book is one of the best places to start. It may have the answers you're looking for or not.  <br /> <br />5-12-05	2005-05-12

The last few times I was in a bookstore, I would see this book sitting on the shelf. I almost bought it once but thought, no, I better not. I finally caved and bought it last week. As soon as I could, I picked this one up and fell in love with Willowdean \\"Dean\\" Lynch. I have to admit that I've always wondered what it would be like to be a pastor's wife. But I was not prepared for the exasperation I felt for the characters (especially for Dean's husband, Ben, who is such an incredibly selfish character) nor did I expect to feel grief on Dean's part when she experienced a difficult tragedy.     King really draws the reader into her story and the reader finds empathy with the characters as well. No matter how exasperating they can be ~~ or how wonderful, they are based on people like you and me. The descriptions of Florida are ones that I never thought of ~~ especially since I don't know anything about Florida.    There is one flaw with this book ~~ somewhere in the middle of the book, the story line just went from fast-paced to drifting ~~ with no conclusion in sight. Then towards the end, it was more put-together, unlike the first part of the book. It did make for some confusing moments as if there were two writers writing the book. But Dean, the main character, was the same throughout the book and she was the one I was interested in reading about.     This is a perfect summer beach read! It's interesting and wonderful about love between two people who have lost so much only to find so much joy. There are stories about the parsonage that makes me wonder if people are really that hyprocritical. Then again, everyone's human. So if you're looking for an entertaining read ~~ pick this one up. You'll be rooting for Dean before long!    5-3-05	2005-05-03

This time, she and Emerson, her husband, traveled back to Egypt at the request of an old friend, Lady Baskerville. Her husband was found dead at a tomb of an old Pharaoh ~~ yet to be identified. Then his assistant was missing. The attacks keep coming and even the natives refused to work for her since they believed that the Tomb was cursed.  <br /> <br />Once they arrived, Emerson and Amelia were busy fending off the attacks as well as solving the mystery of the tomb and the identity of the murderer. It's a faster-paced novel than her first one ~~ and more characters were introduced. Peters keep you guessing on who the identity of the murderer is till the end of the book. <br /> <br />This is another fun novel ~~ I highly recommend this one to anyone who loves to read mysteries. It's pure clean fun and speculation. It's also a perfect series to read over the summer as well (or anytime!).  <br /> <br />4-28-05	2005-04-28

So I bought this book and several more and became instantly hooked on the series!  <br /> <br />This book is the introduction to Amelia Peabody, a wealthy heiress who traveled to Eygpt after her father died to see for her own eyes the wonders there. She rescued Evelyn, a young woman in dire straits. Once they made it there and before they journeyed down the Nile, they met the Emerson brothers. Then their journey became very interesting ~~ there seem to be a mummy trying to scare them off the evacuation site or maybe it was a kidnapping plot. But no one was sure just who the victim was ...  <br /> <br />This is a great beginning to the Peabody series ~~ it's fun and entertaining with that famous dry British wit. It's clean fun too ~~ not bloody or gory like a lot of today's mystery novels are.  <br /> <br />Once you read this book, you'll be hooked onto her series!  <br /> <br />4-28-05	2005-04-28

This is one of my top Five books of 2005. In fact, this is the best book I have read this year. If I could give it a ten, I would. I identified with each of the authors in this collection of essays ~~ even though some of their experiences I may not share, they are writing from the deep reaches of their hearts and souls. This book is not only a collection of essays of women from all ages and all walks of life ~~ it is about Everywoman. It's about you and me.  <br /> <br />When I started reading this book, I thought, oh, I'll have one favorite essay. Nope. I have more than one ~~ in fact, I love them all. These women have a wonderful and rare gift of expressing their thoughts and feelings on paper. They are inspirational for me to be the best mother, wife, friend, daughter that I can be. And if you're worried that this is all about women writing about children and parenting ~~ your fears are groundless. These women are writing about everything. They write about divorce, race, religion, abuse, love, tenderness, parenting, babysitting, watching their children grow up, dealing with prejudice,having nannies, being banned from the mosque and more.  <br /> <br />These women write of real experiences. These women are not angry writers. They are thoughtful and reflective writers, writing with prose, humor and lyrical rhyming. These women reveal their strength and grace in their essays. They don't have any male-bashing in their essays nor are they bitter or angry. They just write and their feelings and thoughts flow together in a wonderful chime of words.  <br /> <br />If I have any regret from reading this book, it's this one. I wish I could meet each and every single one of these essayists and sit down with them and just talk. I have learned so much from the little they've shared within this book, that I want to learn more. They are inspirational for women like me who do like to read and think. These women take in their events that changes them and in a small way, they change my perceptions and thoughts. A reader cannot walk away from this book without gleaning something from this book. It's just impossible. These writers make you stop and think about issues that you may not even be aware of. They challenge the status quo, so to speak. You cannot be comfortable with life after reading some of these essays ~~ but like I said, they're not angry writers, just perceptive and challenging writers. They force you to think, whether you like it or not.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for every woman and men too. Men can learn a lot about women and what we think just from reading this book. If you're looking for a wonderful Mother's Day gift for the thinking and reading woman in your life, this book is it. I also recommend it for high school/young women to read ~~ it gives them an idea of what women face every day as they juggle the roles of motherhood and wifehood or single parenting or just being a woman in today's world. This is a wonderful book and a best gift for everyone to add to their booklist.  <br /> <br />4-12-05	2005-04-12

I thoroughly enjoyed Robin's first book when it first came out years ago, and I was happy to see this one on the shelf. I needed a quick read in between reading books for review ~~ and this one fit the bill.  <br /> <br />Dan Porter is unemployed and his wife is getting highly irritated with him as she has to work fulltime in her career and keep things going. His two daughters are upset with him because they couldn't go to their expensive private school where they were very happy. Dan Porter was living a life based nearly on depression ~~ ever since he got laid off just before 9/11. When he reads of an interview of this woman in Scotland who started up a clothing business right off the ground ~~ and that the business was for sale, he thought perhaps he should go check it out. His son, Josh, offered to come with him and together they started off on an adventure that changed their lives and outlook on life completely. <br /> <br />It's a quick read and very entertaining. Some of the conversations can be wordy but that's what is so entertaining about them. This is just a brief glimpse into a life of a frustrated man who decided that working for fast money isn't just enough anymore. And yes, his wife is a stereotypical character, angry at him all the time ~~ but even there, the reasons for her affair are so flimsy and weak ~~ that is really the weakest part of the novel. But fortunately, she doesn't figure into the novel as much as Dan and Josh are.  <br /> <br />It's a comforting read. And I think it is fair to say that Robin will not be confused with his mom who is one of my favorite authors. He has a totally different style of writing and his way is just as interesting and engrossing ~~ with a modern flair to ages-old issues of love, infidelity and life. It's a good bet that his book won't be considered boring. <br /> <br />4-11-05	2005-04-12
291274:US	49865122	R314UE5E0MOWD7	0060545607	485010020	With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels)	Books	5	4	10	N	N	Riveting, Suspenseful, Intriguing ...	If I could list all the adjectives in here, that'd be great (but redundant!). I have been reading Elizabeth George's books ever since my mom introduced me to Playing for the Ashes years ago. Ever since then, I have read them all, and this book is my favorite so far.  <br /> <br />Out of all the books in the series, this one seems to be the most comprenhesive of her characters. Lynley is back, this time stepping in as temporary Superintendent. Havers is back ~~ demoted to constable, while Nakta Winston is promoted to Sergeant. This time, they're on the tail of a serial killer and at the same time, Lynley is dealing with Hillier, his boss, who wants to drag the media into the investigation. As the investigation heats up as more dead bodies turn up all over London, the heat on Scotland Yard becomes even more intense ~~ and this book is full of surprises and twists and turns.  <br /> <br />This time, the characters are portrayed more thoroughly than before. Lynley shows his private side more in this book ~~ where he is celebrating his marriage to Helen and their upcoming birth of their son. Havers is still the sarcastic person she always has been ~~ but you can see the sensitive person she tries to hide from the public throughout this book. Winston is more of a new character introduced in the last book ~~ and he shows his private thoughts throughout the book. There are other characters also involved with the investigation ~~ as well as the mind of the serial killer manifested throughout the book. <br /> <br />Out of all the books in the Lynley series, this one is the most intense. This one builds up the suspension till its shocking conclusion ~~ and it has definitely taken me for a surprise. It was the last thing I ever expected to read ~~ but while shocking, it does make for good reading.  <br /> <br />While some of the reviewers complain about the grammarical errors in this book ~~ I didn't care. The storyline was enough for me to keep reading. The descriptions of theplaces were not drawn out ~~ I felt that it was designed to keep the reader's interest in the book and to keep pace with the build-up of the suspense. I just have to say, this is one of the best suspense novels I have read in quite a while now.  <br /> <br />If you are new to Elizabeth George's books, you may want to start wtih this one and if it intrigues you, then you can go back to start with the first one of the series. If you are an Elizabeth George's fan ~~ you will not be disappointed in this one. I know that I wasn't.  <br /> <br />4-3-05	2005-04-03

I love books that manages to take me away for a few hours ~~ and I can forget reality of twin toddlers running amok in my house with a new puppy ~~ and this book has managed to do this for me! Garwood, in my opinion, has always been one of the very few authors I can count on for escapism needs!  <br /> <br />This mystery ~~ while predictable ~~ is still a lot of fun to read! Regan Madison Hamilton is rich, gorgeous and generous to a fault. When she was invited to attend a seminar to ensare a con man who may or may not have murdered a woman ~~ her whole life unravels. Told to create a murder list ~~ or a list of people she'd like to be rid of ~~ she did so and shortly afterwards, people started dying and they were on her list.  <br /> <br />Alec Buchanan ~~ one of the numerous Buchanan brothers ~~ is assigned to be Regan's bodyguard at the request of his former boss. And naturally, sparks began to fly between the two of them ~~ and it continues while they try to solve the mystery behind the murders that seem to be affecting people around Regan.  <br /> <br />It's a fun book ~~ quick to read and just pure fun. Watching Regan stand up to her three older brothers, reading about the plots she makes with her best friends and falling in love with Alec ~~ it's a fun book and perfect for those harried days when all you want to do is curl up on the couch and read a good book! <br /> <br />3-31-05	2005-04-01

I have read all of Jodi's books ~~ and while I have a few favorites, this one is definitely in the top ten of her best books. I have to admit that when I first picked up this book, I wasn't too keen on it ~~ it did seem to drag on for a few chapters. But I am so glad that I didn't give up on it ~~ this is perhaps one of her darkest and best written books so far.  <br /> <br />This book is perhaps more lyrical than her others. The closest in comparison, I can think of, is The Song of the Humpback Whale ~~ her first book. There, like this one, she used several characters and write from their points of views. This book is more darker than her earlier works ~~ it deals with several topics at once. First of all, it deals with Delia's abduction by her father. Secondly of all, it deals with the issue of alcoholism and how that affects everything in the alcoholic's life ~~ as well as the lives around him/her. There are other topics involved but will leave that to the reader to read upon ~~ as it gives away too much of the story.  <br /> <br />Delia was six years old when she remembers being a part of her father's magic act. Little did she know that he really did make her disappear. Twenty some years later, she finds out that she was abducted by her father ~~ and her mother is still living. Dealing with the acts of betrayal and trying to figure out who she is ~~ she also deals with rescuing people with her dog, Greta. She is also a mom to Sophie, a finacee to Eric, who is the lawyer representing her father, and best friend to Fritz, a writer. Their stories entertwined throughout this book as Delia deals with her idenity crisis and Andrew's perfidy years ago.  <br /> <br />It is beautifully written ~~ and it has a certain flow to the stories. At first, everyone seems to be awkward and unsure of themselves ~~ but as the novel progresses, everyone starts to find their own voices and desires and the reader can't help but be drawn into their stories. Jodi writes about people andher writing sometimes can be brutally hard ~~ but she knows her characters and she knows how to get their stories out. And this one is perhaps her best-written work so far.  <br /> <br />If you are a Jodi Picoult fan ~~ this book is for you to read. If you are new to Jodi ~~ I would recommend that you read \\"Plain Truth\\" or some of her earlier works first ~~ or just jump into this one ~~ you'll be drawn into her magical storytelling. She writes of people like you and me. Either way ~~ be sure to read this book ~~ it's a great addition to your reading enjoyment.  <br /> <br />3-21-05	2005-03-22

Linwood is the character that I wish I could be ~~ speaks her mind and gets away with it. And this book had me laughing in several spots ~~ which is the best medicine that the doctors could recommend.  <br /> <br />Linwood moves home after thirty years of marriage ~~ moves home to an ailing father, a bossy mom, an uncle who is slowly losing his mind and his beleagured wife. There is the long-suffering brother who is home after his numerous divorce. Linwood was just not anxious to be back home ~~ but she didn't have any place left to go.  <br /> <br />Stuck in real estate classes at night, she works at the local pharmacy during the day time ~~ Linwood becomes embroiled with the local politics in butting heads with the current mayor and council ~~ and she also falls into lust with her next-door-neighbor. This book is just fun ~~ and not so predictable as I thought it might be. It's full of sassy humor and wit ~~ perfect for any woman who is going through a male-bashing period.  <br /> <br />This book is intended to be fun ~~ not a serious tome of life ~~ and it worked for me! It's also a perfect beach/pool read for this upcoming summer! Be sure to bring your glass of iced tea and enjoy! <br /> <br />3-18-05	2005-03-19

Georgia secretly pines for her first boyfriend from high school who had disappeared suddenly in her youth. She thinks she's bored with her marriage to stable John, a professor at Tech. And these are their stories. Funny, sassy, and just hilarious in some places. It's a story of revenge and finding a way to get even as well. It is a story of friendships in the south ~~ and about women growing older together. It is just pure fun. <br /> <br />I wish I had discovered Haywood Smith earlier ~~ she is a fun author to read. She has an ability to say things that you secretly wish you could say and get away with. This is a perfect book to read while you're in the slumps ~~ somehow these women's problems may make your problems not too bad after all. It is pure escapism ~~ and sometimes, we read to escape. <br /> <br />3-12-05	2005-03-13

Their stories are stories that most people relate to ~~ broken hearts, broken dreams and joy and love ~~ and finding the courage to begin anew. Old themes, yes, but wonderful themes. And Binchy still has a touch of her magic in weaving those stories together.  <br /> <br />If you're expecting a return to her older novels ~~ this book isn't it. If you're a devoted Binchy fan ~~ you'll still enjoy this novel as it is just comforting and cozy reading ~~ and perfect for a lazy afternoon reading. If you are new to Binchy ~~ please be sure to read her other books, \\"Light a Penny Candle\\" and \\"Circle of Friends\\" are two of my favorites.

I couldn't decide what books to read when I have my surgery ~~ and I was browsing through my shelves when I saw this. I remember loving \\"Shell Seekers\\" and \\"September\\" ~~ so I thought, who can write better than Pilcher when you're groggy and tired? I took the book, read the first fifty pages and was hooked on it from the beginning ~~ Pilcher is a classic storyteller. And her descriptions of Cornwall is absolutely stunning. This book literally beckons you to sit and have a cup of tea, cozy up on the couch and with the radio playing softly in the background ~~ and this book will take you away.  <br /> <br />This book focuses on Judith Dunbar over a period of years ~~ before the WWII started and shortly after it ended. She was fourteen when her mother and younger sister went back to Columbo to rejoin their father, before his move to Singapore. Judith was sent to live at a boarding school where she struck up a life-long friendship with Loveday Carey-Lewis, a genteel young girl who loved horses and her home at Nancherrow. Judith becomes immersed in the Carey-Lewis family as well as with her aunts and uncle ~~ and falling in love ... Their stories swept over the years with trimuphs, tragedies amidst the backdrop of the war ~~ love, sorrow and joy. Dreams discovered and shattered ~~ it is a story of a time that has never been lived since then. It is about Cornwall and WWII.  <br /> <br />This is a beautifully written novel ~~ poetic and descriptive and lovely. It is also a romantic novel ~~ not a romance novel ~~ just incredibly romantic where it does gloss over the horrids of the war but realistic enough to pierce the heart over the terrors that some of the people had faced. It is also a lush novel ~~ full of thoughts and dreams and letters written in the old-fashioned way ~~ telling stories of lives bygone. It is just an incredible novel ~~ one that I am pleased to have in my possession. Pilcher is one of the few writers in my library that I collect ~~ her writing alwaysbeckon you home. This novel is just one of those that you just have to read to know what I am trying to say here. <br /> <br />3-11-05	2005-03-12

I remember vaguely of hearing other book buddies reading this a while back ~~ and thought, since I have unlimited time on my hands for a few weeks, now would be a good time to read it. And it was thoroughly engrossing, enlightening and entertaining novel. I am a big fan of historical fiction and this one fits that need. <br /> <br />This book focuses on a young girl born in Florence in the Middle Ages. The French are coming, the city is caught in the grips of a holy man, Savonarola's, wrath and prediction of gloom and doom ~~ the end of the world is coming ~~ and a serial killer stalking the streets at night. Alessandra marries her husband ~~ only to find out she traded one life for another. And this is her life story ~~ mixed in with the times and happenings of a volatile time in history of Florence ~~ where Art and Beauty reigns. <br /> <br />It is a wonderful introduction to Florentine history ~~ it definitely sparked my interest in reading more about art and Florence and the de Medicis who ruled the city for generations.  If you're looking for a book to read that has some substance to it ~ this book would be it! It is written very poetically as well ~~ no awkwardness between chapters or anything. The story flows like a storyteller would ~~ calm and sometimes with passion and rememberances and dreams ~~ and just like life, it continues to grow.

Even after it arrived three days later ~~ it still helped me pass away recovery time reading this sweet little book!

Turns out the two women who own the cafe have a nephew that is just a good-looking cowboy with secrets of his own. <br /> <br />And that is just the beginning of a fun and wonderful romance that is set among barbecues and country singing, cranky fathers who forget to take their medicines and all that fun stuff.

It is a return to simpler times ~~ and yet, perhaps not so simple. It may appear to be a romanticized version of farming ~~ but at the same time, it's a reminder that simple pleasures can't always be bought.  <br /> <br />Peter Morgan and his bride, Mae, returns to Lake Emily for his grandfather's funeral. Spurred on the suggestion that his grandmother, Virginia, was going to sell the farm, Peter decided to give up the rat race to keep the farm. Idealistic and young, the newlyweds decided to give it a try. Outsiders in a small community, this book shares their ordeals in wetting their feet into farming, new neighbors and throughout the novel, there are other stories of their neighbors and relatives each facing their own crisis over the years. Their stories are interwoven with the young couple's first year on the farm, along with their trials and tribulations as well as their success and joy.  <br /> <br />It is a novel that harkens back to simpler times when a woman considers herself wealthy if her freezer is lined up with chicken meat (that she has raised and cleaned herself), a pantry full of canned goods and friends to celebrate life with. A man considers himself blessed to be able to get up in the morning and experience the grace of God in the rising dawn while milking the cows. It may be a romantic version of farming ~~ but at the same time, the financial worries are real. Somehow this young couple ~~ who started out starry-eyed and dreamy ~~ faced reality and discovered several blessings and joy along the way. <br /> <br />It is a heart-warming novel ~~ makes me think of those long lazy summer days whiling away on the porch swing reading and drinking lemonade. It is a peek into a farmer's wife's life. If you enjoy Lisa Wingate's novels ~~ you will definitely enjoy this one!  <br /> <br />3-7-05	2005-03-08

I am relieved to report that Lisa Wingate have a contemporary romance novel ~~ and it's clean enough that if I had a daughter to read it ~~ I can allow her to read it! Wingate makes romance fun! <br /> <br />This book focuses on Collie, a hotshot media reporter who had been fired in a scandal back in Washington, D.C. Her best friend from college, Laura Draper, sent her on an assignment for one of the numerous magazines that Laura is in charge of. So Collie heads to San Saline, Texas, broke, jobless and boyfriendless. And there, Collie discovers a world that she has never known of ~~ where peacocks wake you up in the morning to gazing at the starlit heavens of a Texas evening. Instead of focusing on her articles, Collie finds herself making friends left and right ~~ and falling in love with True, a true cowboy.  <br /> <br />It may sound simple and sweet ~~ but sometimes, you just need those times to read those books.

In some ways, it's the best written novel of the three ~~ the characters have matured and Ann Moore focused more on describing the times and travels of the time period. It is also perhaps more lyrically written than the other two ~~ it is a wonderful ending to a series ~~ makes you long for more! <br /> <br />This time, Gracelin O'Malley and her children, Mary Kate and Jack (her son who she thought had died only to discover that Julia Martin has taken care of till he was returned to her arms) ~~ have ended up in California to meet Captain Reinders, to accept his marriage proposal. Only thing was, he wasn't there and fortunately for Gracelin, she was able to find work as a cook at a doctor's house. She had traveled over the country, looking for her brother, Sean in Utah, and when they finally landed in California ~~ Mary Kate was seriously ill (which is how they met the doctor who offered Gracelin a job).  <br /> <br />This time, the story also tells of Morgan, who did manage to escape from prison only to have four years wrested from him due to mishaps and errors. This novel tells of his story and his experiences in the new America. And this novel also tells the story of Sean O'Malley ~~ the fiery wordsmith who feverently believed in freedom and equality for all men ~~ and was banned from Ireland. This is his story too.  <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book that captures the most favorite of all three of the strong characters that have lived through all three books. It combines their tales and dreams and despair ~~ as a reflection of the times they were living in. It also told tales of Mary Kate and Jack ~~ the future generation that Morgan, Grace and Sean have fought for. And while the stories are entwined, once again, the main character is the strong and formidable woman of courage, Gracelin. She is awe-inspiring and breath-taking ~~ defining the meaning of \\"woman\\" in allits glory. She is also a reflection of all those pioneer women who have struggled to come to this land to build a home for their families and loved ones. She reflects all of those dreams that women have dreamt of over the centuries. She is Americana herself. <br /> <br />If you've read the other two ~~ even if you haven't ~~ this book is definitely not one that you shouldn't pass up on. It may be stories about a few people ~~ but it's about every people. It's about America at its best and at its worst. It's about your ancestors and mine. Ann Moore has captured the feelings and dreams so wonderfully that it is as if you're right there with them. It's just hard to pass up a wonderful talent like this ~~ so grab this book, a box of kleenexs and settle back for a breath-taking journey. <br /> <br />3-7-05	2005-03-08

When Amazon announced this book was coming out, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of Princes of Ireland. Normally, when I get a Rutherford's book ~~ I knew that I was in for a long haul of entertaining and informative reading ~~ and he didn't disappoint in that respect, but this book isn't as good as his others. I really enjoy reading about the Celtic culture ~~ but somehow I feel as if he skimmed over a good portion of Ireland's history.  <br /> <br />It has been said that every Irish person is descended from kings and queens. This book shows a definitive lineage for several families that Rutherford writes about. Their stories were well-crafted in the times they lived ~~ and I found the characters interesting and real as most people are through the tests of time. There may be a bit more historical facts this time in this book than in his other books ~~ which does help me understand the times of each character and why he/she did the things they did.  <br /> <br />It is an interesting read ~~ more suited for winter nights than a beach read as it is a heavy tome. If you are a Rutherford fan, this book will not disappoint you even if it isn't as good as the others were ~~ he still weaves a wonderful tale of people lost in the mists of time. If you are new to Rutherford's books, this is just as a good place to start. <br /> <br />2-27-05	2005-02-27

It's about time there is a book about ordinary women who meet together once a month to talk about books only to bond through life's ordinary travesties! Sure the book starts out with a group of women meeting together to discuss a book or two ~~ but this novel is more of women and their relationships with one another among the ordinary backdrop of life itself in an ordinary English town. This time, it's women that you and I can relate to ~~ it's about your mother, sister, best friend, your daughter and you ~~ all the women you know and love in your life all wrapped in this book. You know the characters because you live their lives.  <br /> <br />These women, Clare, Susan, Polly, Nicole and Harriet meet once a month to discuss that month's book. Through their conversations with one another and separately, you begin to gleam their characteristics. Nicole and Harriet are best friends who pull no punches when it comes to the hard issues of life (like betrayal/infidelity, babies and so on). Susan and Polly have the older children ~~ they met through their children. Susan is also taking care of an elderly mother. Clare struggles with her own problems of being unable to have children. These women bonded together over books at first then over each other's dilemmas. Reading these books for their bookclub gave each woman an opportunity to open up and be rewarded with friendships that is life-enriching and meaningful. It's like reading gives you an opportunity to open up to other rewards that is being offered to you by other readers. It is a gift that keeps on giving. <br /> <br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable read. Once my mom reads this book, I plan to get my bookclub to read it. I have not read most of the books listed in there ~~ but that's ok. I will now! I love how these women have opened up since the first bookclub meeting ~~ makes me wish there is a sequel. This is a book that clamors to be shared ~~ so don't hesitate in making this one of your bookclub reads or even for your own personal enjoyment. It's one of the best reads for my 2005 list! <br /> <br />2-24-05	2005-02-24

I have forgotten how wonderful Judith McNaught's novels can be ~~ she has a way of getting her readers involved in her books so that they can't help but finish the book in one day. She has the same magic with this book as well. <br /> <br />This one, I could have sworn that I have read a long time ago ~~ only to discover that I haven't and it made the reading even more pleasurable. This one is about a rich and pampered young girl, Diana, who knows nothing about want and poverty. She meets Cole, her friend's stablehand, who is ambitious and hungry. Their friendship was unique enough that they never have forgotten each other through the years. When Diana finds herself jilted at the eve of the Orchid Ball ~~ the one event that Houston prides itself on having every year for charity ~~ Cole sweeps in for the rescue and becomes her knight in shining armor.  <br /> <br />Yes, sometimes, the novel is unbelievable ~~ but who cares? When I read McNaught's books, I read to escape from my reality of changing diapers and chasing kids all day long. She does a great job of stirring the imagination that when I finished reading the book, I was all relaxed again and able to enjoy life as a busy housewife. She writes about the magic of falling in love. And it does help that falling in love in such glamourous settings, it alleviates the winter boredom that is in this household! It's a perfect beach read or snuggling up next to the fireplace ~~ this book is guaranteed to carry the reader away for a few hours. <br /> <br />2-22-05	2005-02-22

It is written very well and I thought, personable. This book starts out with Denny Roman as a somewhat neglected child of two geniuses ~~ her parents are more interested in neurology research than they are in being her parents. Denny has a relationship with her mom, Lily, that sometimes veers back and forth from close to distant. Then this book shows Lily as a woman other than a mom. Then there is Maureen, the go-between for Denny and Lily ~~ who ended up being the one person that is constant in Denny's life. <br /> <br />This novel is broken in three parts ~~ one where Denny first discovers the acting bug. The second one is where she is a struggling actress in L.A. and the third part is where she is on the cusp of opening night of her first play that she has written when Maureen's son shows up on her doorstep. Throughout this novel, it shows the relationship between Denny and Lily ~~ the strains and finally, the acceptance. <br /> <br />It is an enjoyable read ~~ but somehow, it isn't enthralling or attention-getting like other novels are. It is just a story of a mother and daughter relationship ~~ and how sometimes, life happens when you least expect it. It is a brief look into dreams and relationships and life.  <br /> <br />2-22-05	2005-02-22
348458:US	49865122	RM40TTFIQFL7V	141845107X	971329550	A Burden of Silence: My Mother's Battle with AIDS	Books	5	23	23	N	N	A Heart-felt Tribute	Even with all the publicity about AIDS today, there aren't enough books out there that describes a personal battle with this dreaded disease. This book is a wonderful attribute to the author's mother ~~ and a courageous story of her mother's battle against the stigma of having AIDS. I will even admit that when I first hear or read the word AIDS, I automatically think of the movie, \\"Philadelphia,\\" and the courageous battles that those afflicted with the disease fight to get the virus studied so there will be a cure for it someday.  <br /> <br />I do recall reading about tainted blood transfusions back in the late 80s and early 90s ~~ but you don't hear stories about those victims. Nancy Draper changed that. I will not be able to think of an AIDS victim without thinking of her mother. <br /> <br />Not only did AIDS afflicted her mother, it afflicted her whole family ~~ not with the virus but with the ignorance and the stigma associated with AIDS which people did consider it to be a gay disease. Nancy kept her parents' wishes to keep silent about the real cause of her mother's illness ~~ but it was a struggle for her. People's comments about not wanting to touch anyone if they knew that person had AIDS left a silent echo in Nancy's life as she struggles to take care of her mother and to make her last days comfortable. Her mother wanted so much to be held but she \\"felt dirty\\" and contaminated because of this awful virus. People's impersonal reaction to her situation leaves one shaking their heads ~~ and at the same time, reflective of how much more we need to educate people on this disease. <br /> <br />Nancy wrote a beautiful tribute to her mother and her mother should be proud. Nancy says that she wants the world to know about how AIDS affect not just the individual, but the family as well and their friends. It is one of the fastest-growing diseases out there and people need to be educated on what it is. This book is a great start to educating people on what AIDS is and how it affects everyone's lives. <br /> <br />2-16-05	2005-02-16

I was mesmerized from the first page.  <br /> <br />I was 11 when Princess Diana exploded on the scene. I watched the wedding that day ~~ and sighed over the fairytale of it all. I was 27 when she died ~~ and watched her funeral. So maybe I wasn't as keen on Diana as some of the others were, but she was an icon of my youth.  <br /> <br />This book is a fair book describing her life before she married Charles and after her divorce. It showed a side to their marriage that brought understanding on their marriage (she was too young, I thought to be married into the Royal family, who I feel is removed from the realities of their country) and how it disintegrated into the public mess that I remember reading about in college. The authors took pains not to point fingers at either one of them in the blame for their marriage's failure ~~ they reminded us that their marriage is just like any other marriage ~~ set out with high hopes and expectations, only neither was equipped to deal with the other or how to fix their problems.  <br /> <br />Then reading about how Diana manipulated the media to her advantage as well as to the advantages of her causes ~~ shows a savvy business woman who does understand the consquences of good media coverages. It was an interesting read on that account.  <br /> <br />To paint Diana in a black and white picture is not fair to her because this woman, according to the authors, was a paradox. She showed many facets of her personality that kept her interesting to all that knew her, whether they liked her or not. She was portrayed as a caring mother, a compassionate charity worker, a high-strung wife, and so on. In my opinion, she's a refreshing change from the stiff-lipped royalty in England. This book shows her growing up in the 16 years of limelight and it's a fascinating read. <br /> <br />2-1-05	2005-02-02

I really enjoy George's writing style! I don't even mind her \\"long-winded\\" novels ~~ they are suspenseful and entertaining and definitely, keeps my attention while reading (a major feat nowadays!).  <br /> <br />This slim collection of short stories are entertaining, thought-provoking and sometimes predictable. I have not read any of her short stories before so I didn't come into this novel with huge expectations. It was fun read ~~ a quick one too.  <br /> <br />My favorite story in there was I, Richard. I just love the irony in that short story. I also like the tidbits of history that she threw in there ~~ as I am somewhat of a history buff. My second favorite story is Remember, I'll Always Love You. That one was NOT predictable at all ~~ and talk about a life of mystery outside of a marriage ~~ it makes one wonder if he/she really knows the person he/she married!  <br /> <br />It's a refreshing change from reading novels all the time to read short stories, especially by one of my favorite authors. This one has a small collection of well-written stories ~~ bound to entertain you. <br /> <br />1-31-05 <br />	2005-02-01

I wish someone had given me this book when I was pregnant with my two sons. This is a book I plan to buy for my moms' group ~~ I cannot remember the last time I was so enthused about buying a book for other people ~~ this book is definitely a must-read for all parents. I suppose I could share my copy with my friends, but no way. This book is my copy ~~ it's going to help me in the future as well when my two sons travel even further down the path to growing up to be adults. <br /> <br />If you are planning to have kids, this book is a good read for you too. If you are a parent and tired of yelling and nagging your kids to do what you want them to do or not to do ~~ this book is for you.  <br /> <br />Most parenting books tend to be on the dry side ~~ more factual than helpful. This book is honest, written with humor and the author shares her insights and personal stories about her three children and how she deals with certain situations that comes up in the midst of raising children. Mrs. Pantley admits that there are times when she fears for her sanity ~~ kids are kids! And not only does she share her stories, she also gives practical and kind but effective suggestions on how to achieve what you want done ~~ without hurting your child's feelings and without you losing control of the situation (whatever that may be). Also, at the end of each chapter, she outlines the main points for you to remember.  <br /> <br />This is an incredibly helpful resource in parenting right now. I read this in three days and outlined major points that will be helpful as I deal with two toddlers right smack in the middle of the terrible twos. I am positive this book will help me in the future when they're starting school, becoming teen-agers and so on. This is a practical guide with wonderful insights on how children behave and why they behave this way.  <br /> <br />I am grateful that there is a book like this one out there. I only wish I had discovered it sooner! <br /> <br />1-18-05	2005-01-18

The two sisters, Maggie and Rose, raised by a grieving father and a distant step-mother, grew up different as sisters can be. Rose is the older sister, successful and one with the brains. Maggie is the scatterbrained younger sister with the looks to envy for. This novel is their stories ~~ fun, sometimes complicated and entertaining.  <br /> <br />This is a perfect summer read ~~ it's an entertaining tale about two sisters who never thought they'd be friends since they are so different. But deep down inside, they began to realize that they may be a like after all.  <br /> <br />So if you're looking for a fun book to read on the beach or on some dreary winter night ~~ this book is the perfect escape! It's enjoyable and funny in some parts! And sometimes, it will make you long for a sister as fun as Maggie and as responsible as Rose. <br /> <br />1-10-05	2005-01-11

She has more guts than most of the men in her family do and she's inspirational. I also like how Jakes ties in different people from the historical stand-point with her story.  <br /> <br />This novel opens with Amanda trapped inside the Alamo with the Texans during that fateful battle with the Mexicans. Captured as a Mexican war-of-prisoner, Amanda finds love and comfort with the man who rescued her from a certain death. When he died, she was eventually free to go back to Texas. And this is just the beginning of a long adventure. After Amanda gives birth to a son, Louis, she travels to California. And throughout her years, Amanda's main obssession was how to regain the control of Kent and Sons from Hamilton Stovall.  <br /> <br />This is a fast-paced novel ~~ perhaps more so than the others ~~ and somehow it feels like it's seeped in more historical details than the others. Jake covers the Alamo, the Gold Rush, the expanding business in the Northeast of the USA, Texas becoming a state, slavery and abolition. Also in this novel, Amanda becomes reunited with Jared, her cousin, for a very brief time. This is also an introduction of Jared's son, Jephtha Kent, who is a minister in Virgina, also uneasy with the Slavery question. He soon becomes ostracized by his family and friends for his beliefs.  <br /> <br />If you're expecting a historical novel with details on our ancestors' lifestyle back in the 1800s, this novel is definitely one of the better ones! Pick this one up too ~~ you won't regret it! <br /> <br />1-10-05	2005-01-11

This book also combines the main characters' stories into one ~~ Jenilee of Good Hope Road meets up with Kate and Karen of Tending Roses as they try to discover their family heritage. This book, however, focuses on Karen, the super successful one of the family. Karen who is so perfect, dresses like a fashion model with her immaculate hair, a dashing career that takes her everywhere and happily married to a dashing airline pilot. In Tending Roses, Kate shared some of her resentments of her perfect older sister. <br /> <br />In this book, the perfect older sister just got laid off from her successful job and her annual pap smear came back with an abnormal reading. Desperate to get away from Boston, Karen came to the farm in Missouri to get away from it all for a few days. Only that few days turned into a couple of weeks. Involved with JumpKids, a local community group that involves kids into making a production of a famous movie, and mentoring the neighbor girl, Dell, who was Grandma Rose's protege, and rediscovering her marriage again to James.  <br /> <br />Written beautifully and with elegant prose, this book is a great sequel to my other two favorite books of all time. The message is essentially the same: Take your time, smell the roses and forgive your grudges. Life is too short to hold grudges and bitterness. This is an awesome book for moms to give to their daughters, sisters to give to one another and friends to share. It is a book that is poignant of a time past when things seem to be simpler and the answers were clearer. It reminds us that after all of the things that has to be done in the day, it's better to have family around. <br /> <br />1-11-05	2005-01-11

I picked this book up at my hairdresser's and finished it in two days. I have never read Coben's books before and was not disappointed by this one ~~ it's engrossing. <br /> <br />Dr. Marc Seidman lies in a hospital bed after being shot twice by an unknown assailant. His wife is murdered and his six-months-old daughter is missing. This is just the beginning. The police suspects Marc as the guy behind the kidnapping and the murder of his wife. Desperate to find his daughter and to find the truth ~~ Marc didn't allow anyone to stop him from completing his quest.  <br /> <br />As the mystery unravels ~~ so did Marc's suspicions. The truth lies closer to home than he ever realized. <br /> <br />It is a fun book ~~ perfect for a long dreary winter night. It is a definite fast-paced thriller. If you like murder mysteries, this is a good one. It's suspenseful enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br />1-10-05	2005-01-11

She did the same with this book ~~ however, it falls flat at the end, so be warned. I wish I was warned that ~~ all it did was leave more questions hanging instead of answers. <br /> <br />This book is delightful for me even though I am not middle-aged. It talks about a group of friends that have known each other for years and years ~~ ever since childhood. It's a middle-aged version of that popular TV show, \\"Friends\\" ~~ for awhile. Then the members started dying off ~~ first it was Camilla's husband, Charlie. Then it was Henry's wife, Fairlie. Then it was Anny (the main character of the novel) who lost her husband, Lewis in a boating accident. Lewis, Camilla and Henry all grew up together on the Island. They did everything together ~~ swam and fished, hunted for treasures and so on. They had the idyllic childhood that most people wish they had. Then Henry married Fairlie and Camilla married Charlie ~~ even though Charleston society long assumed that Henry and Camilla would marry one another.  <br /> <br />That is the first part of the book ~~ and the second part of the book is about their middle-age adventures and of grief and loss. Anny then becomes mired in the midst of a storm that is coming ~~ and she doesn't seem to be aware of it though the reader can predict it coming. The second part of the book also talks about losing friends and spouses ~~ and welcoming new friends to the family.  <br /> <br />This is not one of her better books ~~ but it's well-written and entertaining. I've waited for a long time for this one to come out ~~ as I have always enjoyed her writing. She's a classic story-teller. <br /> <br />1-3-05	2005-01-03

It continues the story of the Kent Family and fills in necessary holes that you won't get from reading Book Four of the series. <br /> <br />This one is about Abraham who falls in love with his step-sister, daughter of Peggy McLean and Justin Fletcher, from book two, and of their son, Jared, and his cousin, Amanda, daughter of Abraham's brother, Gilead and his mean-minded wife, Harriet. Abraham and Elizabeth tried to make their fortune in the Wild West which was Ohio then ~~ only to lose everything when an Indian killed Elizabeth. The story then focuses on Jared, who was dumped on his uncle's household and made to feel unwelcomed and unloved. This book also describes how the Kent Family lost their printing business that Philip Kent had worked so hard to build up from the ashes of Revolutionary War.  <br /> <br />It is a short book ~~ necessary and entertaining in some spots ~~ but filled with historical antedotes in between the War of 1812 and before the Mexican war. This one is about Jared. Book Four is about Amanda.  <br /> <br />I don't regret reading this one at all ~~ it's interesting enough. <br /> <br />1-3-05	2005-01-03

I've read a lot on the Civil War that way ~~ and now I am reading John Jake's American series. I have forgotten how wonderful a story-teller John Jake is! From the very first word he manages to ensnare the reader into a life very different from our own. He fires the reader's imagination to the hardships and the horrors, the inspirations and dreams of ordinary people that help shape our country to be what it is today.  <br /> <br />This novel focuses on Philip Kent, an illegimate son of a Duke in England. Though born and raised in France, Philip was taught by his mother to be educated in spite of their poverty. His mother's dream was to see her son walking among the nobility. Circumstances destroyed that dream and his mother and forced them to flee France and England to the colonies across the sea. Caught up in the fervor of the times, Philip becomes one of the Colonies' fighters and dreamers. <br /> <br />If you're interested in reading a bit on the Revolution ~~ this book is a great start to get you going. I wish I had read this series years ago. This is wonderful ~~ full of stories of all humans from all walks of life and it definitely fires your imagination as you read about lives past. <br /> <br />12-20-04	2004-12-20

John Jake focuses on Philip Kent again and this time, introduces a new character, a dissolute drunkard from the Virginian plantation families ~~ Judson Fletcher. Philip is sent to the front to fight while his wife, Anne, stays behind with their son. Judson meanders between his father's plantation, and Philadelphia and Richmond.  <br /> <br />This book is more intense on the war ~~ describing the conditions of Valley Forge where the men encamped for a bitter winter. They describe more battle scenes that makes you feel like you're right there having a sunstroke with the men. It gives you a glimpse of the hardships these men fought, despaired over and died for. Like Paine said, \\"These are the times that try a man's soul.\\" It's not exactly a wonderful read but the author wasn't too brutal in describing the wartime scenes. <br /> <br />And it's a reminder of what the men of the Revolution fought for.  <br /> <br />It is a good book ~~ perfect for those long winter nights. If you like history and fiction, this book is among the best combination of the two! <br /> <br />12-20-04	2004-12-20

I am amazed that I read this book in two days. I read it every chance that I could get ~~ naptimes, bedtimes were moved up earlier, during the boys' playtimes ~~ you get the picture. I was warned that this book would keep me enthralled from the first page to the last page ~~ and she was right. This is an excellent mystery filled with drama and suspense. It is hard for me to believe that this author has not been propelled to the Top Ten of the Best-Sellers list anywhere.  <br /> <br />This book focuses on Allison Jensen, a young girl who is the oldest of a big Mormon family. Six years old, she and her best friend were playing in the woods when their lives changed. For the worst. Allison manages to escape but her best friend ended up missing. To Allison's bewilderment, no one mentions anything about Cindy, her best friend. Not her parents. Not her Bishop of the ward, nor anyone. So for years, Allison blamed herself for Cindy's disappearance because she was sure that is what everyone else must have thought. <br /> <br />Allison grows up and the mystery surrounding Cindy's disappearance intensfies. Allison finds herself in the middle of a family drama that seems to worsen over a matter of time. Already butting heads with her father, Allison finds herself butting heads with the authorities in the Mormon church. She wants to find out exactly what has happened to her best friend. As well as providing a back-drop to Allison's struggles to redeem herself, this book also provides some insights to the Mormon Church. And it's a reminder that no matter what ~~ no matter who you are in the hierarchy of the church leadership rungs ~~ everyone is human.  <br /> <br />This book is wonderfully written ~~ suspenseful and compelling ~~ it should have come with a warning sticker on it ~~ you cannot put this book down because you want to know what happens to Allison. So when you decide to read this one ~~ be sure to carve out a chunk of time to read it ~~ you will need it.  <br /> <br />12-11-04	2004-12-12

At first, the first three chapters grabbed me by the throat ~~ then it winds down to a theology book that just serves to remind me of what it is like to be a Christian in today's world.  <br /> <br />It starts out with the author's regret that we cannot mention Jesus' name in today's society ~~ and the fact that America is now a paganized country. That alone is controversial but the entire book is controversial as well. After talking about how America is now a paganized country, he mentions on how to be the \\"Light and Salt\\" of the earth to minister to today's society. Stowell has some very good points in that Christians today need to stop preaching and start practicing the acts of Jesus in order to bring light to the world. <br /> <br />It is a very short and very interesting book ~~ I wish it had more information on the early Christians and how it impacted the Roman Empire. It could use more substance to its stories and ideas and theories. But as a small book, this is a great start for those who are interested in knowing more about Christianity. <br /> <br />12-1-04	2004-12-01

Not only is it for parents ~~ everyone should read this book if nothing more than to have a refresher course on the dangers (and fun) of being on the Internet. This book is written simply in layman's terms but it doesn't \\"talk down\\" to the readers as some of the other computer manuals do. It is not a dummy version of a computer \\"how-to\\" either. This book is very well-written and well-thought out. It is a must-read for the moms in my mothers' group as well as for all the parents and friends involved in the cyberworld. <br /> <br />I have a personal experience to share with you. I haven't heard much about phishing on the Internet till I read Mr. Johnson's book. In there, he mentions what phishing is and how to avoid them. He also offers practical advice on how to deal with unwanted emails/spam, how to avoid getting a virus through an email or even on certain websites. He mentions the real dangers of predators preying on children through instant messaging or even in chatrooms. He offers simple but well-thought out directions in how to encounter certain situations (like if your child is talking to a sexual predator, what do you do and how to handle the situation, always admonishing the parent to remain calm). He didn't write this book to stop children from being on the Internet ~~ because the Internet does offer a wide-range of activities that will help educate the child with his school work as well as other things. He just writes to warn of the possible dangers that each one of us face while surfing the net. <br /> <br />This is definitely a book I would recommend to everyone. It doesn't matter if your child is fifty years old ~~ it's a great refresher course for all of us. For parents, it opens our eyes to potential trouble spots to keep our children safe. After all, that is our primary job as parents ~~ keeping our children safe. <br /> <br />I am glad to have a copy of this book in my personal library. I plan to pass this one around to my friends.

That first book is what I've always thought what great Southern literature represents. So I eagerly bought the sequel ~~ not knowing that it was unfinished and that it also contained a biography of the author by her editor. It was kind of disappointing as I thoroughly enjoyed the first book.  <br /> <br />This one is a portrait of a grown-up Will Tweedy ~~ and not as the lovable character that is fondly remembered. After all, he is now grown up and facing adult issues. It is also not as well-drawn out of a character as in the first book. It is still interesting to read but somehow, it doesn't leave me with a satisfied feeling as Cold Sassy Tree did. Then when I realized that the author had died before completing the book, it all came together for me. <br /> <br />It is interesting ~~ and is a jog down memory lane. I really enjoyed reading the author's bio by her editor ~~ it gave me an insight to an author that I wish had written more. <br /> <br />12-1-04	2004-12-01

She writes as if she's sitting down at a table in an old farmhouse kitchen, writing as if she's going to write a letter just to you. She is very inspirational and very thoughtful. She writes as if she knows her neighbors even if they're down the road quite a ways away. She writes about human nature and how we all struggle to be good. She writes beautifully that makes you stop and think for a moment ~~ yeah, I know exactly what she's talking about.  <br /> <br />This one is a relationship between two neighbors. There is Jenilee ~~ one of those \\"no-good white trash Lanes\\" that live next door to Euradora Gibson, who used to be best friends with Jenilee's grandma. Jenilee is one of the forgotten children. Born to an abusive father and a sick mother who eventually died of cancer, Jenilee barely scraped by in school, taking care of her mom, her brothers and her dad. Euradora is an elderly woman with lots of regrets in her life. She didn't realize just how bitter she has become till a tornado ripped apart her house. Jenilee rescued her and together, they set off on a journey that leads to many open doors to the future and to many door-shuttings of the past.  <br /> <br />It is beautifully written. A must-read for all mothers and daughters, sisters and friends. It's lovely, inspirational and thoughtful. Wingate writes of true things that happens to all of us ~~ in each of us is a lonely, forgotten \\"Jennilee\\" or an unhappy \\"Euradora\\". I wouldn't hesitate reading any of Wingate's books. We need more writers like her around! <br /> <br />11-24-04	2004-11-25

I read this book expecting to get the same kind of reaction as I did with Losing Julia ~~ and this book, while very well-written, didn't move me as much. I loved reading about Mead's experiences in the World War II. I can relate to Andrew not fitting in with his peers. I admire the relationship between grandfather and grandson even though they had to work to get it. I find it a very good story ~~ just not as heart-felt as Losing Julia was.  <br /> <br />Mead takes in his grandson after his grandson was found threatening a class bully with a pocketknife. Disgusted with today's generation, Mead didn't know what to do with Andrew as he didn't understand the lack of direction his grandson exhibited with his own life. When Andrew tried to committ suicide, Mead decided that enough was enough and took him to retrace his old footsteps in WWII. Mead was one of the wave of young men that stormed the beach at Normandy to over-take it for the Allies. Mead had witnessed unspeakable horrors and sorrow as a young man and he had sworn he would never go back. Well, he reneged on his promise to himself for the sake of teaching his grandson the value of life.  <br /> <br />This is a beautifully-written book. It has the substance of sharing a valued historical piece ~~ that will soon be lost to the tombs of time as more and more WWII veterans passes. It is a wonderful story of a man and grandson coming together in life to find themselves having something in common ~~ their love for one another.  <br /> <br />11-24-04	2004-11-25

She told me that this would be the best bookclub read ever ~~ and she's right. This is definitely one of the best books I've read in quite awhile. It is inspirational, thoughtful and full of wisdom. I couldn't put it down ~~ and reading it also coincided with my uncle's death ~~ so it really made me stop and think about what this book is trying to tell me.<br /><br />Kate comes home from the big city to her grandparents' farm ~~ to help her grandmother and to break the news to her that soon, grandma will have to go to a nursing home. Kate and her husband, Ben, expected to stay there for a couple of weeks ~~ till after Christmas, at the very least. Ben and Kate have an infant, mounting medical bills and other worries. Kate also feels isolated from her husband ~~ as well as perturbed about her grandmother's upcoming move into a nursing home. Coming home to the farm meant many things to Kate.<br /><br />Her grandmother leaves out short stories for her to read at different times of her stay ~~ and they're like little pearls of wisdom ~~ my favorite is: \\"The best times of my life, the times that passed by me the most quickly, were the times when the roses grew wild.\\" (You will find this quote on the backjacket of the book.) It struck a little too close to home ~~ here I am in the daily frentic rush of toddlerhood with two little boys and remembering loved ones that have gone on before us ~~ this book was read in the exact right time.<br /><br />But even so, you don't have to read this book in the busiest time of your life ~~ this is a must-read for all women who wants to remember their most favorite times in life. This is a wonderful read ~~ sad and rejoiceful and thoughtful. It is a book that women will love to share with their friends and family. It's about a young woman growing up and reconnecting with her past, her grandmother and with her future as well as her present. It is just a delightful book!<br /><br />11-5-04as her present.

It is very imaginative and very entertaining. I just love it ~~ it has a good plot and a good moral to it. It is a classic fight between good and evil and about magic ~~ it is just a clean and fun book to read. It may not suit to everyone's taste but I find it wholesome and fun ~~ and geared to children who are interested in reading. (This is a fun book for adults to read too.) <br /> <br />I find it a combination of different lores ~~ there is a resemblance to Lord of the Rings, and a resemblance to Narnia chronicles (my absolute favorite) and to different Greek myths that still linger centuries later.I also find a Christian theme throughout this book as well. Every English major would see them in this book ~~ it is a combination of all of the favorites. It is not a drawn-out book like Lord of the Rings ~~ but it is just wonderful for children to read. It might help keep them entertained to read more and more.  <br /> <br />This book is about Bryon, a satyr whose day of misrule is on the day of Midwinter. That very day, he starts off on an adventure ~~ following the star that appeared in the sky and followed to the end to find Silverlance. He is joined by a centaur, dwarf, dryads and other creatures that livened the story with their adventures. It is of a magical time and of a time when dark evil threatens all that Bryon and his companions hold dear. It is a journey of faith and hope as well as despair. It is just a wonderful book.  <br /> <br />Don't give up on reading this one ~~ this is just as magical as Harry Potter is ~~ perhaps more so. <br /> <br />10-27-04	2004-10-28

It is way more than a fishing story (though I thought it was at first ... ) and it's a story about people, broken dreams and beauty.  <br /> <br />Noah came to the Valley of Light, a little area in the Carolinas, in his travels. He had heard from his old friend about the lake there ~~ where there is this big mean bass there and no other fish around. Noah meets the townfolks and several of them are helped by his presence ~~ and for a short week, he becomes one of them. <br /> <br />It's a beautifully written novel ~~ full of light and grace as Noah remembers the war and as the other characters move forth into new lives. This is definitely one of the better reads and one I highly recommend for any time ~~ a trip to the beach, to the cottage, or for sitting by the fireplace. It's a book that is guaranteed to take you down memory lane and perhaps discover new things to think about. <br /> <br />10-20-04	2004-10-20

I do have to confess that it took me awhile to get into the story lines ~~ but once I got more into the book, the stories woven together managed to draw me into the lives of the characters. There is Nicolas, the artist, who gets a commission to draw the paintings for the tapesteries for an upcoming noble man. There he falls in love with the nobleman's daughter, Claude. There is the relationship, strained as it is, between Claude and her mother. There is the housemaid who Nicolas impregnated. There is Beatrice, waiting lady first to the mother then to the daughter. There is the family in Brussels, whose lives are forever changed once Nicolas entered it. All of these stories are woven together in a span of a couple of years ~~ and little do they know that their actions influence each other whether they are in Brussels or in Paris. <br /> <br />It is a compelling look into history as well ~~ and a wonderful story of those who make their living off the looms. It is a mixture of nobility and merchant class that have come together in this novel. Once you pick up this book, you will not be able to put it down. All of the stories draw you into the characters' lives and dreams.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" immensely ~~ read it long before it became a top seller. I enjoy this one just as well ~~ and wished I had picked it up sooner. It's a great book to escape into ~~ the descriptions of the Lady and the Unicorn are just wonderful that I can see it in my own mind. This book is another must-read for those who like art and history.  <br /> <br />10-15-04	2004-10-16

She is my favorite mystery author ~~ I just love Barbara Havers, she's my favorite character, so I was a little disappointed that she isn't featured in this book. But I like Deborah and Simon ~~ so I was ok. <br /> <br />This novel is the latest to come out in paperback. After a hiatus of a few years, I was really looking forward to getting this novel. But, it's not the same as her older books. The suspense wasn't quite there. The characters aren't quite well-developed like the others were. It was a dark and dreary book ~~ without the bit of historical lore that I love to read. Don't get me wrong, it is still a fanastic book and a great one to take on a road trip with you. It's just not the same as the others.  <br /> <br />Deborah comes to Guernsey to help her friend, China, who came from the US with her brother Cherokee. Only problem is, China is accused of murdering the rich benefactor of the island ~~ Guy. Guy escaped France during WWII and during France's occupation by the German Nazis. He and his sister have managed to run a series of an upscale hotel chain and when they retired, they lived on Guernsey full time. There, they met others who have fought during WWII and decided to build a museum to honor those who died for Guernsey and Britian. But Guy is discovered murdered ~~ and the evidence is directed at China. Deborah gets her husband involved in the investigation ~~ and soon, it became a race against time to snare the killer before he or she strikes again. <br /> <br />It is a good read ~~ compelling as well. You can't read the last page to discover who did it ~~ she has the neatest trick of putting off back page readers ~ by not disclosing the identity of the murderer on that page. So just settle down in your couch and enjoy this latest mystery.  <br /> <br />10-10-04	2004-10-11

This book didn't disappoint me! I thoroughly enjoyed this book ~~ in spite of a busy life as mother of toddler twins and a wife ~~ I managed to \\"escape\\" for a few hours in reading this novel. <br /> <br />Regan manages to escape her overbearing uncle and guardian and lost her finace ~~ only to land into Travis Stanford's arms. Never wooed or courted by the demanding Travis, Regan falls hard in love with this rugged American. Then she left him ~~ and that is when the novel really got to be fun for me! The heartaches they both suffered because of their stubbornness, but Travis really came through in the romance department.  <br /> <br />This is a perfect novel for these chilly winter nights ahead ~~ it is bound to carry the reader away into a land of romance and happy endings. <br /> <br />10-3-04	2004-10-04

I love suspenseful novels and mysteries ~~ and this is my first introduction to Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus. It is a fun read ~~ fast too. Some of the descriptions I had to skim over since I am not a fan of detailed murder scenes ~~ but other than that, it's a fun book to read, especially when it's cool outside and there isn't much you can do around the house (or need an excuse to laze around and read a book in front of the fireplace!).  <br /> <br />Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus are in Brooklyn ~~ in the Orthodox Jewish ghetto, celebrating their honeymoon, when one of the boys vanished abruptly from this closely-knit religious community. Peter is then set on an adventure finding this kid before it's too late. The runaway is not traveling alone ~~ a killer has taken him under his wings and blood, mayhem and terror are on the way. Peter knew that he was racing against time in saving this kid as well as other innocent lives.  <br /> <br />It is a fast-paced novel ~~ one that kept me on the edge of my seat reading.

Little does anyone know that Nicole, a French refugee, is actually a member of one of the oldest families of France ~~ her ancestors intermingled with kings and queens and married them. Throughout this book, Nicole is reminded of her mother's gentle admonishing to always be a lady. And she is.  <br /> <br />Nicole stands in for Bianca when a gang of ruffians chased them in the park ~~ and Nicole gets kidnapped in place of Bianca whom they really wanted. Married by proxy to a man she has never seen, Nicole is on her way to America.

Then she falls in love with her next-door neighbor's son.  <br /> <br />In between love and the fairy tales, Clementine decides to remake herself into the person she wants to be ~~ and it's a glorious and sometimes funny little book.

This one has more dialogue than descriptions than the others ~~ which is why I gave it a three instead of a four. I love reading about the lush scenery in her other books and was disappointed that this one didn't have it as much. I love reading the descriptions of the food, the people and the history of the Lowcountry ~~ and this book barely skimmed on any of these. It has a more of a hurried feel to it ~~ like the author is racing to the last page. That is my opinion though and don't base your call on buying this book on that! It is just an observation! <br /> <br />Linda moves back to Mount Pleasant, S.C. where she had grown up. She has two daughters ~~ one entering college in the fall and one who is a junior in high school. She is divorced from her accountant husband ~~ also fighting him for the lack of attention that he pays the girls. She moves back to Mount Pleasant ~~ figuring there is no place like home. She finds a job as a restaurant manager in this restaurant that is a hole in the wall ~~ called Jackson Hole and owned by two men, Robert and Brad. Brad is a single dad estranged from his wife in Atlanta and after a tragedy, he is raising his son.  <br /> <br />The book is based on Linda and her adventures in returning home. It is based on her relationships with her daughters and other members of the restaurant staff. It is an easy read and sometimes funny in spots ~~ you won't regret reading it.

However, this is an exciting book based on exciting times after the Civil War and just before the end of the 1800s. Nate Richardson has dreams ~~ big dreams of getting out of the tobacco fields in North Carolina and manufacture cigarettes and strike it rich. Chess (Francesa) Standish's grandfather has a machine that isn't patented and agreed to give it to Nate ~~ and Chess offered herself as part of the bargain ~~ as his partner and wife. Chess is thirty years old and fears she'd never get married. Nate was her only chance. <br /> <br />Together, they created an empire that builds a town and builds their name across the Alantic to London where they eventually traveled to. In spite of Nate's affairs, the couple are happy together but it takes another man for Chess' affections to get Nate to come around and fall in love with his wife.  <br /> <br />It's an interesting novel ~~ very glittery and stylish. It does lack substance in some ways, but it's still a good read. It's not my favorite read of the year but it's enjoyable enough that I will recommend it to others.  <br /> <br />9-21-04	2004-09-21

It's a sexy book ~~ fun and sweet. Ren has escaped to Italy to his grandmother's old villa for a few weeks before commencing on the next movie.

She discovers with Ren's help the real reason why the villagers were hostile to her and makes amends.  <br /> <br />It's a charming book and a quick read. It's fun ~~ pure fun.

It just doesn't sound like it'd be something I'm interested in. But after reading the blurb on it and having some of the other moms in my local bookclub pick it to read for our bookclub meetings, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Clare and Harry may not have the classic love story of all times (the ones that I think of are Rhett and Scarlett in Gone with the Wind) ~~ but their love story is wonderful, fascinating and sexy. The time-traveling didn't bother me a bit ~~ I didn't get confused like some of my friends did ~~ it was fun and a secret part of me wishes that my husband can time-travel so we would know each other in our youth. This book speaks to the romantic in me ~~ what woman doesn't dream of seeing her true love and knowing that he's there waiting for you to grow up? This is a different twist on the Cinderella story.<br /><br />Clare is a young girl of 6 when she meets Harry for the first time. He was 43. Throughout the years, Clare meets the Harry of her future in different ages, normally when Harry is under duress. They struggle with having children and suffered lots of miscarriages before finally having one ~~ and this child too, inherits Harry's ability to time-travel, only this time, he's there to prepare her for it.<br /><br />The love scenes are touching in some ways and other times, it's raw and uncensored and there are other times, when it's just humdrum ~~ like marriages are. However, Clare is patient and loyal to a fault ~~ always waiting for Harry to come back from his travels.<br /><br />This is an interesting perspective on the classic love story ~~ it has more twists and turns in it than most novels do. It's hard for me to believe this is just her first novel since it's so well-written (minus a few choice words that she CAN do without but that is the English lit major in me talking) and the characters are thoughtfully well-drawn. It's a fun book to read ~~ one that is hard to put down for a few moments. It's a perfect book to read during the cold winter nights with a blanket wrapped around you ~~ it's that long and that deep and it gives you insights on love that you may not have considered before.<br /><br />9-11-04are thoughtfully well-drawn.

After reading this slim volume of short stories, I think I will add it to my wish list as well as his other works.  <br /> <br />Doctorow writes realistically and grittingly of real life. He writes of scam artists, kidnappers who returned a baby, living in a religious commune, a woman who survived three marriages only to rediscover herself in Hollywood and a murder mystery that the White House is intent on keeping covered up as a dead boy was found in the Rose Garden. All of these characters are different from one another and he manages to put in new perspectives of human nature in each of the stories. Sometimes, it's gritty and not so pleasant to read, the stories themselves are compelling and interesting.  <br /> <br />Now that I've \\"discovered\\" Doctorow through a mutual friend, I will now keep looking for his books to read in hopes they are as good as his short stories have proven.  <br /> <br />9-11-04	2004-09-12

And the story keeps on going.  <br /> <br />Elizabeth is a cool ice princess ~~ unable to bear the touch of a man and Miles is determined to melt that ice. That alone makes for a fun story ~~ watching the sparks fly between the two characters. Roger plays a more prominent role in this novel as well ~~ and falls in love though the novel doesn't explore his love story as much as the Montgomery men.  <br /> <br />Written with humor and sass, this is another keepsake in my collection ~~ and a perfect escape from reality for a few hours. If you're looking for something to read while soaking in a hot bathtub, this book would be it.  <br /> <br />9-11-04	2004-09-12

Whenever I am stressed out, I usually try to escape into one of Deveraux's books ~~ and when I am finished reading it, I am all better for it. This book is just a cure for those blues when you've got them!  <br /> <br />It's written with Deveraux's magical spell ~~ yes, she writes romances with the heroine full of sassy spirit and beauty who falls in love with the big bad man with the heart of gold and they have fights and arguments full of spark and flares ~~ but every book she has written is still different from the last one and still just as enchanting as always. This book is just as wonderful as the others. <br /> <br />Alyx Blackett is on the run from a lecherous Earl who had murdered her father and set her home on fire because she resisted his attempts to rape her. She joins the band of outlaws in the forest diguised as the leader's squire. Raine Montgomery is on the run from the King for trying to raise an army to rebel against the King (which is a rumor and isn't true) and sparks begin to fly between Alyx and Raine and the battles they endure to ensure their love for one another is nothing but fun to read ~~ and you just can't help but be carried away into another time and place. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a quick escape from reality ~~ this book is a perfect fit for that escape! <br /> <br />9-11-04	2004-09-11

I've never read or even heard of Tamar Myers. This is the first book I've read of hers and I plan to read the rest of the books in the series. <br /> <br />Prim and Proper Magdalena Yoder is innkeeper of the PennDutch Inn that was in her family for generations. Her sister, Susannah (who Magdalena thinks should have gotten her name instead!) is gorgeous enough and dating the local sheriff who is after Magdalena to make a confession for a murder in her barn. Magdalena knew that she's going to have to figure out who put that pitchfork through the assistant director in her barn, because it wasn't her and she can't get the sheriff to believe otherwise. Hollywood has come to town and Magdalena is right in the midst of the upheaval. <br /> <br />This is written with spry and witty humor ~~ and Magdalena is just great as a detective. It's a fun book ~~ one that you can't really put down till the last page is finished. It's an interesting twist on detective novels ~~ it's more of an old-fashioned type of detective work and not full of the technology whiz that is common in today's mysteries. It's just clean fun and one that I would like to read more of! <br /> <br />9-11-04	2004-09-11

Linnett and Devon fought too much for my liking and Devon was just a little too perfect and arrogrant for me.

I picked up Christopher's book because I am a fan of his mother. This book isn't disappointing at all ~~ Rice is a different writer than his mother and the talent is there and it's all his. I didn't get the feeling that I was reading one of his mother's books ~~ this is a totally different style of writing and I am hooked.  <br /> <br />Kathryn and Randall are best buddies as freshmen in Atherton, a fictious college set outside of Boston. Randall is having a secret affair with his college professor, Eric Eberman, who is a art historian professor who also studies Bosch. This is where the story begins and Rice begins to weave a tangled web of deceit, lies, and misconceptions ~~ till a woman is murdered and the web becomes even more entangled with more characters that lead to different theories. Sometimes, the stories are half-muddied ~~ meaning, that they're not quite finished and leaves more to the imagination than the reader would like. But the plot is solid and the lyrical writing is wonderful to read. It's a great mystery and I found myself unable to tear myself away from the story.  <br /> <br />This is a perfect reading for a cold fall night when the fire is crackling in the fireplace ~~ and you're all alone. It's not only a gothic mystery read ~~ it's also a self-search into man's search for happiness and meaning to life. It's an enthralling book ~~ and I am now curious to read more of Rice's books. <br /> <br />8-24-04	2004-08-25

Manette Ansay has written another beautiful book ~~ this time about an angel that has been sighted over a river in Wisconsin. It is also a story about a small town where everyone knows one another and where everyone knows of its neighbor's struggles. The story is centered around a little boy named Gabriel. Gabriel was dumped in this town, Ambient, by his father who deserted him. Fat and unlovable, Gabriel is a devout Christian and is always found to be praying. Picked on and abused, Gabriel continues to slug along ~~ till one day, he is discovered in a neighbor's barn, dead. <br /> <br />The story focuses on Gabriel, his aunt who was raising him, several members of a prayer circle, and one of the daughters of the town who was part of the fateful events of the evening that Gabriel is later found dead. The stories entwined with one another in small ways ~~ it's written more like short stories combined to make one novel about a town. Ansay writes with her usual lyrical style about different lives of people and their secret joys and disappointments and how it all meshed together with the legend of the River Angel that people have taken to be their local lore. <br /> <br />It is a very interesting book ~~ dark and depressing in places though but beautifully written and with a grace that is evident in each of the characters written. Ansay is not an easy author to read sometimes but her stories are always compelling and brings the reader further into the book. This is an excellent read ~~ perfect for a bookclub discussion.  <br /> <br />8-24-04	2004-08-24

It is an easy read ~~ meaning, it keeps you engrossed throughout the whole book. I couldn't put it down ~~ I read it every chance that I could. But it's not my favorite book.  <br /> <br />Pauline and Michael gets married in the haste of WWII. They spend three decades raising children and quarreling with one another over everything. They lose their oldest daughter when she ran away ~~ and ended up raising her son, their first grandchild. They divorce and Michael remarries to an old friend of Pauline's.  <br /> <br />It is a look into marriage; a deep, probing look into marriage. It is a marriage of opposites and a traditional marriage where the man goes to work and the wife stays home to tend to the children and the home. Both of them are deeply disappointed in the marital choices they have made but have no clue to how to get out of it, or how to recitfy their mistakes. Michael grew more distant over the years and more involved with the stores, while Pauline remained the social butterfly that had captured Michael's heart the first time he met her. They evolved from two young persons that seem to be made for one another into two old people who couldn't stand each other. This is a personal and deep look into marriage and life. It is full of disappointments, joys, humor and memories. The reader becomes enmeshed into the characters' lives without realizing it.  <br /> <br />It is an enthralling book ~~ but it's not a bubbly cheerful book though. It has its moments when it seems to be overwhelming despairing and depressing. But it also has its moments when life is presented at its best. It's an interesting look into marriage and how it evolves (or doesn't) over the years. <br /> <br />8-19-04	2004-08-20

I bought it this summer while on vacation since I am in the midst of collecting all of Oprah's past and present selections. I just picked it up two days ago and haven't been able to put it down.  <br /> <br />At first, Malika's story seems to be centered on pretty dresses, jewelry and the royal life as an adopted princess. She was adored and never wanted for anything. Eldest daughter of General Outfir and his wife, Malika grew up among royalty. That all came crashing down when her father is assissinated for planning a coup to overthrow King Hassan of Morrocco. Malika and her brothers and sisters and mother spent the next twenty years in jail.  <br /> <br />The tone of Malika's voice as she tells her story through the writer changes over the course of the years. She remembers her childhood fondly and sometimes with despair. She remembers her years of prison as a torture but yet a challenge. She recites their heady days of freedom as overwhelming and joyful. She tells of her sadness and bitterness that she has wasted her youth in prison and never knowing love or having a baby and her fears of never knowing anything other than despair and gloom. This is an honest and sometimes brutual look into herself and her years in captivity.  <br /> <br />It is not a depressing book. It is a gripping tale of how one woman and her family survive the ordeal and how they re-entered society after twenty years of being out of it. It is an insight to a life that most readers will never be privy to (fortunately!) and it takes tremendous courage to recite those years of sorrow to make it real to us readers. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a book that shows another depth to the unfailing human spirit, this book is it. Malika is an ordinary woman caught up in the whirlwind of a royal society and made to pay for her father's sins. She survived ~~ and with courage and beauty that I'd never imagine possessing. <br /> <br />8-16-04	2004-08-17

Elizabeth misses that attentiveness. Now, all she does is vaccum up poppy-seeds from his breakfast bagels before she's out the door traveling to inspect posh hotels. It's not her idea of romance. <br /> <br />In desperation, Elizabeth turns to her sister, who is in the know about who is who in Hollywood and she points Elizabeth to a guru who claims he can \\"enhance\\" her life and solve her problems. Sure enough, the potion that he gives Elizabeth works ~~ much to her amazement then later on, to her horror! She got the attention that she wanted ~~ but then, it got to be too much and she wonders if she had created a monster. <br /> <br />In a lively chase that includes a stint in jail, Elizabeth and her friend, Clover, end up discovering lots of truths and realities about themselves and their marriages.  <br /> <br />It is a fun book ~~ a hilarious look at how people seek happiness using other means instead of relying upon themselves and finding the ingredient to a happy life lies within themselves all along. It's a cute book to read on the beach or on the long flight home. It's not a serious book to read ~~ but it's fun enough to take your mind off whatever is bothering you. It's a sure bet that Heller's books are always that fun! <br /> <br />8-16-04	2004-08-17

I have no idea how I have obtained this out-of-print book ~~ but after selecting it from my bookshelf one night, I am really glad that I had it available. It is one of the funniest and raunchiest books I've read in quite a while. The characters are bigger than life and immersed in the changing times of the 60s and early 70s. Ruth Harris has taken her readers on a journey back into time ~~ where free love is in and flourishing. <br /> <br />The novel starts on the day of JFK's murder. The three characters, Jane, Elly and Lincky, all were in the prime of their lives and their lives changed on the day the president was killed. Jane was there in Dallas with her date, Owen Casals, who was covering the presidential trip for his magazine, Newsflash. Elly was selling shoes in Washington, D.C. to a spoiled socialite. Lincky was going for lunch in downtown Manhattan when she heard about it. Fate and men brought these women together and together, they fought against the conformity of society's expectations of what women should or should not do. They fell in love and out of love. They fought for their jobs, lost their jobs, lost lovers and hopes and dreams. Through it all, they were right there in the midst of the sexual revolution and civil rights movement and the drug-craze of those heady days. <br /> <br />This is an enlightening book for me as well as it is fun to read. Normally, I don't like to read books on the 60s and the 70s since their decadence seems to be overwhelming ~~ but this book is an exception. It was FUN to read.  <br /> <br />I recommend this one ~~ if you're looking for something different to read.  <br /> <br />8-17-04	2004-08-17

This time, this is about Blair and Lee, who was Houston's former fiance. They fall in love before their wedding even though Blair blames herself for making Houston unhappy. Then she wonders what Lee is up to ~~ every day he goes off on a mysterious errand and comes home hours later and more tired for it, while Blair works at the women's medical center.  <br /> <br />Together, they are a team and unbeatable ~~ and this novel is a great escape from reality. Not as intense as Twin of Ice, it is still a gripping read. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down. Highly recommend this book for pool-side reading or waiting for those dance/karate lessons to be over. <br /> <br />8-16-04	2004-08-17

When one of the girls in my bookclub recommended this book for our September read, I silently groaned. I thought this was another one of those books that would be dry and witless ~~ and a waste of my money (not to mention, my time!). I am very very happy to report that I was indeed wrong about this book. This is definitely one of the best reads I've read this summer. (I know, I know, I keep saying that lately with all of my books, but honestly, this is really one of the best reads ever!)<br /><br /> Terry Ryan writes with humor and prose about her mother raising ten children in the little midwestern town, called, Defiance, in Ohio. Evelyn is not your typical mother. She doesn't stay home and bake cakes all the time. No, this is one woman who really defines the word &quot;mother&quot; in all its best definitions. Evelyn is a woman of bravery and wit who, in the face of daunting circumstances, decides to enter contests to earn a little money on the side to support her ever-growing family. She hides the food in the dryer and forgets they're there too ~~ that is just one of many humorous incidents in the Ryan household. She writes rhymes for contests and poetry. She thinks of ways to earn an extra dollar that her husband's job doesn't cover.<br /><br /> There are some dark spots in this book ~~ Evelyn is married to an alcoholic who squanders away most of his paycheck on drink. There have been a few abusive incidents reported in the book ~~ not to garner self-pity, but as a fact of life in the Ryan household. Evelyn shows her strength and courage in the way she deals with her children, the adversity in their lives and always with grace and love. She meets up with other women who love to enter contests as well and this is a loving tribute from a daughter to her mother.<br /><br /> Ryan writes convincingly and beautifully. This is a story that tells of a by-gone era that I am not even familiar with. My husband, on the other hand, is very familiar with the contests and can say some of the sayings from memory. This book is a journey down memory lane as well. Defiance is not the same town as it was back in the 50s and 60s. It was nice reading about the streets that have become very familiar to me and it gives the reader a nice sense of history in &quot;Everytown, USA&quot; ~~ when downtown was the main hub of activity before the urban sprawl came along and took the businesses out of the downtown.<br /><br /> This is a story I highly recommend everyone to read ~~ mothers, daughters, sons, fathers ~~ everyone. It's a great piece of history and a wonderful tribute to a woman who never gave up hope even in the midst of troubling times.

It's perfect for those long lazy summer days when the kids are playing and you're looking to escape into a good novel. So grab your lemonade and sit in the shade and have a good read! <br /> <br />If you like mysteries, this book is it. It's fun and full of twists and turns, sometimes predictable, but thoroughly fun to read! I have read Jude's other books on romance and I like the fact that she's branching out into other areas of writing. Writing the same thing over and over again can be tedious for the author and her fans ~~ so this is a refreshing break for readers like me! <br /> <br />Ford Newcombe, an author struggling to write since his wife's death,meets Jackie Maxwell, who has a secret so big that she doesn't even know it. Together they set out to solve an old murder mystery that Jackie has vaguely remembered. There was talk in this old southern town of a woman who was murdered because she was in love with the devil. Ford buys a house there and Jackie, as his assistant, helps refurbish the house in the memory of what it used to be. Together, they discover a secret so deep that keeps the town together, as well as their love for each other.  <br /> <br />This is not a romance book, but there is sexual tension between the two characters that makes things very interesting and fun. Jackie is the character everyone just can't help but like. Ford is witty and intelligent and fun ~~ this is a fun book. This is such a perfect read for summer!

It's a perfect &quot;take-me-away&quot; book and it's perfect for any time when you need to escape from reality for a few hours.  <br />  <br /> Anna Lutz Abbot is probably one of my favorite Franks characters so far. She's funny, witty and down-to-earth. She's best friends with her ex-husband, who incidentally, is gay, and her childhood best friend, Frannie, is still in the picture. She adores her daddy, who has been with her ever since her mother's death. She has an adorable daughter who is coming home for the summer. What more can she want? Well, it turns out ~~ more. She needed a place of her own to live. Tired of her boss haranguing her every minute, she quits her job and starts up her own beauty salon. Anna buys a house on the Isle of Palms, where her happiest memories reside. Her next-door neighbors are the same ladies who took care of her when her mother died, Miss Mavis and Miss Angel. Her other next-door neighbor, Lucy, is smitten with her own father. And yes, there is a new man in Anna's life.  <br />  <br /> This is a fun, witty and sassy novel based in the South. Franks writes as Anna tells it ~~ and it's a fun story to escape into. I adore Franks' other books ~~ she has a writing style that manages to grab your attention and keep it. She keeps drawing you into the story further and further, till the last page is turned and then you're disappointed in having to wait another year or two for her next book. She writes as if you're sitting on the porch with her, drinking a beer from a long-stemmed bottle, feet up on the railings of the porch and it's a lazy summer evening. She writes as if she knows everyone (no matter how slightly) and you're enthralled and want to know more.  <br />  <br /> This is a fun read ~~ one hard to miss this summer. So if you have time, grab a beer or a lemonade and sit on that swing of yours and dive into this book. It's funny, witty and you'll fall in love with Anna too. <br />  <br /> 7-30-04	2004-07-31

I just love Richards' books since she delves into her characters' lives and she brings her readers along with her into a journey that travels back and forth in time between two different generations of people, especially women. This book is no exception. In fact, it's better than Whiskey Island in some ways ~~ the sisters are more mature and dealing with more mature issues than being single and wondering if they'll ever fall in love.  <br /> <br />Each of the sisters are set on their paths that they have chosen in life. Casey, who is not written about very much in this novel, is pregnant and happily married to Jon, her friend from high school. The novel centers mostly on Megan and Peggy. Megan and Niccolo are married but dealing with a shattered saloon that a tornado has torn apart, the growing lack of communication between the two of them and with Megan's restlessness as she is temporarily out of work. Peggy takes her son, Kieran, to Ireland after putting medical school on hold since he has autism and Peggy decided to devote time to helping Kieran learn the basic skills. She also went to be her cousin's companion. Irene, a lovely Irish spinster, is seeking answers to her father's death eighty years before. The sisters all help with the research and along the way, found answers to their own questions and problems as well as discovering the great secret that Irene's father has been holding all those years. <br /> <br />This is a great escape-novel. If you're overwhelmed with life and life's demands, this is the perfect book to sink yourself into for a few days. It's not a demanding reading but it's a fun reading ~~ and Richards keeps you guessing as you turn the pages. Once again, she writes about star-crossed lovers, relationships between husband and wife, between sisters and friends and lovers. It's a wonderful novel. She has the charm to keep you coming back for more. <br /> <br />7-23-04	2004-07-24

Berman writes convincingly of his opinions and thoughts on totalitarian and how it is related to the Islamist movement that is raging through the Middle East. He writes about how the current Islamist movement came to being and why. He tells of the reasons why bin Laden is fighting the war against us ~~ not because we're greedy corporate Americans but because we are a threat to his and his people's vision of utopia. He also delves into the Israel and Palestine's problems. He also explains the history behind communism, facism, and socialism. Berman also talks about Western Europe and their ideas on democracy as well as United Nation's ineptness in dealing with different problems.<br />This is perhaps one of the most rewarding reading I've done lately. I don't know much about Islam and what causes Muslims to declare a jihad against Westerners. Then again, I don't know much about the history of the last fifty years or so. And this book has whetted my appetite to know more and how liberalism is related to the current events going on today, even with the Bush's administration. It is also a great way to learn more about the Islamist movement that is going on in the Middle Eastern countries as well as Arabic countries. It is an eye-opener for me and it does help me understand current events better.<br />This is one book that I will definitely pass onto my friends and family. I think everyone who is curious about world affairs and likes essay-type writing, will enjoy this book. It will provoke thought and conversation among your friends and family. It will help you see the world in a different light, even if you don't agree with the author's perspective. But he makes his arguments in a convincing way ~~ and the book is easy to read, very well-written and with thoughtful, concise reasoning behind every word. <br />7-15-04	2004-07-16

It is well-written, thought-provoking and a challenge to the reader, no matter what the political views are, in what Flanders had to say about the women in this current President's administration. This is a more behind-the-scenes look into the women who hold the nation's top jobs. <br />It is a refreshing look into politics as well. It isn't a book that spouts out fire and mudslinging against the current administration. It is a well-researched look into what the average person don't read about in the newspapers or hear in the television news channels. Flanders also points out inconsistencies among those women in what they say and what they are really backing. She also points out when the media don't point out the inconsistencies among these women and the current administration. It's very interesting to read because this is not your typical news-source. <br />This is also perhaps one of the most readable books I've read recently. Flanders doesn't bog the reader down with too much details. She just writes matter-of-factly and leaves the opinions to the reader to derive from her research. It's very interesting and like I said, very well-written. I have never heard of Laura Flanders before but I am now intrigued enough to read her other books to see if they are concise and knowledgable as this one is.<br />7-7-04	2004-07-08

Like the other reviewers, I got an advanced copy of this novel ~~ and just loved it! This is a sassy and fun reading ~~ where the heroine grows into herself and finds out that one can make lemonade out of lemons!<br />You have Elizabeth, who was raised by MeeMaw after her mother died. She was born in a small community outside of Augusta, Georgia. She is the manager of a small dollar-type store that is being threatened by a big superstore coming to the area. Gathering her resources, Elizabeth convinces her friends and family to fight the superstore. And along the way, Elizabeth finds true love and the deep secret of her past. <br />This is a fun, witty novel about friendship, family, and love. It's a great read ~~ the quotes at the beginning of each chapter is fun and the writing flows like a conversation between friends. So if I were you, I'd grab a glass of iced tea and this book ~~ go sit somewhere outside and enjoy this funny story. It's a perfect read for summer!<br />7-6-04	2004-07-05

Jaskunas is a brilliant writer who manages to describe every detail in this novel with a flair ~~ and convinces you, the reader, that you are right there beside Maggie, his main character. He writes compellingly of being a woman ~~ delving into a woman's mind as she struggles to come to terms with the past. <br />Maggie is a victim of a beating that left her half-dead. Her husband, Nate, is arrested for it ~~ and spent six years in jail. Another man then confesses to the crime that has left Maggie with epilepsy for the rest of her life, as well as questions that will forever haunt her. She was so convinced that it was her husband that has beaten her to a pulp ~~ but everyone else around her is convinced that it's this new guy, Ben, who actually beat her. This novel is about Maggie's journey in the present and into the past where she goes over her courtship with Nate, her marriage with him and how everything became unraveled.<br />This is a haunting novel ~~ one that will leave you with empathy for Maggie. You are immersed into the Indiana countryside, searching for answers as well ~~ and it's a brilliant look into domestic violence and how it affects all areas of a woman's life as well as a man's. This is not your typical light summer reading but it is just as compelling, and just as hard to tear yourself away from this story. This author, Paul Jaskunas, is one to keep an eye out for. He is definitely a writer of merit.<br />7-4-04	2004-07-04

I was too young to remember anything of Vietnam or WWII or anything like that. And this book serves as a reminder of history's lessons.<br />This isn't my typical reading ~~ my dad loaned this book to me to read. This isn't a typical book either, nor a typical subject. I've never really thought much about evil or what it means as I've never really been exposed to it. Morrow writes, in essay-style (which makes it easier to read and to grasp his thoughts in a way that makes you ponder each word), about evil. It's not a scientific study. It's not a book that puts the blame on people. It grasps different thoughts of evil, what it means and he used examples to back each thought. Yes, Hitler may be the most popular subject in this book, but that is probably because Morrow grew up with hearing the horrors of the concentration camps as he was born in the late 1930s.<br />This is one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. It is also not an easy read ~~ it is rather dark since Morrow expounds on the subject of evil and whether evil is ever justified or not. He also explores different types of evil ~~ though it is hard to do so since evil is evil and he'll admit that too in this book. He doesn't touch much on the theologian definition of evil in this book ~~ but rather on his thoughts and questions of what he defined is evil.<br />If you're in a reflective mood, this book would be a good choice. I think philosophy majors, religion majors and even English majors should read this book ~~ it's not your typical book, and it's a book that makes you ponder. You have to come up with your own definition of evil but this book is a great start on that journey. It is also a great discussion fodder for any book group.<br />7-2-04	2004-07-03

It's predictable, not as well-written as Dan Brown's later works, but still, it's a riveting read ~~ perfect for a hot summer day. <br />Susan Fletcher is one of the top cyber programmers at NSA, engaged to be married ~~ her finace' was sent off on a mysterious errand when she was called into work. Turns out to be a long day at work. NSA is the spy of all spies ~~ NSA is the mainframe for which the government depends on for its top secret intel files ~~ NSA can spy on just about anyone in the world with just a few keystrokes. And that is where the trouble begins. With an ambitious programmer dead, the race is on to prevent a meltdown among the investigating communities. Susan Fletcher finds herself right in the middle of a mess that she never thought she would be in.<br />It is interesting. The computer jargon would thrill my husband more than me, but it was still a fascinating read. It was a quick read ~~ Brown used his trademark skills here ~~ where every page is a suspense-filled page. In spite of its predictablity, it is a fun read.<br />6-28-04	2004-06-29

I took it on vacation and was glad to have something light-hearted to read. I am also glad to see that Landvik has improved her writing talents since this book too. =0) <br />Patty Jane gets deserted by her handsome husband just before her daughter was born ~~ and if it wasn't for her mother-in-law's support and her sister, Harriet's support ~~ Patty Jane didn't know what she would do. These three women struggle with issues of life ~~ love, laughter, death, romance and friendship ~~ together with their newfound friends in a beauty salon that Patty and Harriet started up together. This is not your typical salon either ~~ where else in Minneapolis would you find delectable Norwegian desserts and listen to harp music being played while your hair is being done? <br />It is a cute book ~~ a light-hearted read and fun ~~ it's absolutely perfect for a beach read if you need something to read while sunning on the beach. <br />6-26-04	2004-06-26

It wasn't the Indian of the Cowboy tv shows where they were portrayed as idiots or savages ~~ but as the people who were close to nature and the spiritual world. <br />This book does not disappoint. This is a very concise portrayal of Sitting Bull from an author who took great pains to portray Sitting Bull as how the Indians viewed him and as how as the Whites viewed him. He didn't allow his emotions cloud the facts ~~ it was very obvious that he took time to research the facts and present them without boring the reader to tears. He showed Sitting Bull as the greatest Sioux leader of all time and how he worked to unite the Lakotas and the Hunkpapas as well as other Indian nations together to defeat the White invasion. He also presented the facts that allowed the readers to be aware of why the Indian battles were a losing cause ~~ simply because there were more of the Whites coming. There were not enough Indians to keep populating the land. <br />This is one of the most in-depth research I've read and enjoyed on any Indian leader. This one goes beyond Sitting Bull and talk about the problems the Indians faced ~~ and yes, it does have some moments in there where you just allow your emotions to override the story ~~ Sitting Bull may not have had it easy but he sure didn't make it easy for the US military or the Indian agents on the reservations. He gave back as good as he could ~~ and he never quit fighting for his people. He is admirable not only as a man, but as a leader. This is definitely a worth-while reading for anyone who is interested in history ~~ especially Native American Indian history. <br />6-26-04	2004-06-26

As a first-time mom of twin toddler boys (they will be two in three weeks) ~~ I have literally thought I was losing my mind till I found this book. When I picked it up and read the first paragraph on when to let your toddler sleep in a &quot;big&quot; bed, I was hooked. <br />Thank goodness for an author like Iovine ~~ she definitely knows her toddlers. And not only is she humorous about the situations we all face as parents with toddlers, she is also reassuring that we are not nuts. That all of a sudden that our sweet little infants turned into these demons running our lives. =0) She has made lots of valid points about raising children, discipline and how to deal with it. She also reassures me, as a first-time mom, that it is all normal. She points out the humor of the situations ~~ in a gentle way as if to remind us that it's not all bad.<br />I am just glad that I am not the only mom out there who feels like she's the meanest and baddest mom dealing with two toddlers running ramshod all over the house/world. This is not only a helpful guide ~~ it's a reassuring guide. It's light-hearted enough to get me out of the doldrums to laugh again ~~ and it's serious enough to give me pointers that I may not have considered before.<br />I am definitely buying this for my niece who is expecting her first child this fall ~~ I sure wish someone had bought all of these Girlfriend's guides for me!<br />6-26-04	2004-06-26

It is also an insight to life in the African-American culture back then. It is about a young girl finding her way in the times and finding her future and finding her voice. It is a thoroughly enjoyable novel ~~ beautifully written too. <br />Johnnie Mae loves to swim. She longs to swim at the all-white swimming pool instead of the Potomac River. She would stare at the swimmers at the pool which is across the street from her Aunt Ina's house. Always working and always watching out for her youngest sister, Johnnie Mae longs for more. Then when Clara, her sister drowned one afternoon when all the kids were swimming at the river, Johnnie Mae tries to deal with her guilt and memories. She befriends a new girl who reminded her of Rat ~~ the nickname she has bestowed on her sister ~~ and they grow up. <br />It is a neat insight to life back in the 1920s. It is beautifully written ~~ you see the world from Johnnie Mae's eyes as well as from her mother's eyes. It is a journey that lingers long after you've turned the last page.

Bush	Books	5	49	60	N	N	Interesting point of view	Since the reviewers have already done a great job with reviewing this book, I'll keep it brief. <br />John W. Dean, a former counsel to President Nixon, has written a book illustrating his reasons for why he believes the Bush administration is full of secretive motions and how they manage to stonewall any sort of investigations that might hinder their goals for the presidency. It is very well-written. It is supported by facts, website links to different articles and theories and studies, and yes, he does have an opinion ~~ but he manages to balance his opinions with facts to support his argument. He also does a comparison between Nixon's presidency and Bush's administration ~~ and it is well-thought out and thought-provoking.<br />Everyone should read this book regardless of their political views ~~ it's not just a book about the presidency, it is also a look on how politics manage to color everything in today's world as well. It is also a look into the political realm in Washington D.C., where both political parties try to fight for control. It's interesting and sometimes disturbing to read but worth your while, especially if you're a student of politics or just a concerned citizen with the state of affairs in the country.<br />6-5-04	2004-06-05

I had read it a few years ago and thought, I'd read it again. <br />This is a book that you can read again in different periods of your life. The first time I read it, I found it funny. This time, I found it tragic as well as funny. It also has a wistful tone to it as well. Life speeds by before you even realize it. <br />The Ivys come to town in preparation for Mrs. Ivy Sr.'s wife, whose sister, Marge, is on her deathbed. Pearl had left her hometown ~~ more like escape her hometown to become a beautican only to marry an undertaker, or a &quot;funeral director&quot; as the Ivys like to call it. Then there is Sicily Lawler, the youngest sister who married the high school principal and her daughter, Amy Jo, who is enthralled with her first love, a Gifford. And this is their stories. It is just a story of a typical family in the late 50s. They are just as human as we are, with lost loves, disappointment and fears. They also trimpuh over ordeals, imagined or real. <br />This is a fun novel to read ~~ it takes you away into places forgotten or just barely remembered. It makes you long for your family again and the flush of youth. It makes you stop and count your lucky stars for where you are in life right now. <br />6-4-04	2004-06-04

I am slightly disappointed that this book is just ok ~~ not as riveting nor as compelling of a read as I had hoped. It's entertaining enough to get through the whole book ~~ but it leaves with more questions than it's worth.<br />This book is about one marriage that falls apart, leaving the daughter in the center of the marital storm. Then her mother decides that she's in love with her best friend, Laurence, whom she has known since she was a teenager. Laurence then embarks on an affair with Gina, leaving his family behind in a mass of confusion ~~ which also left me, the reader confused. <br />I understand about affairs, love affairs, romances dying and marriages ending ~~ but this book barely skimmed the emotions of the characters involved. It barely even touched upon the damage of trust and the brokenness of promises and dreams. Even the affair between Gina and Laurence barely had any substance to it ~~ Sophy's story was more relevant in this book and she's just a confused daughter trying to find her place in the world. This book also has a touch of unreality to it as well ~~ a dreamland and so vague.<br />It's an ok novel ~~ I mean, I finished it, didn't I? But it's not enough of an opportunity for me to try Trollope again. Others might find this book riveting and compelling enough to read ~~ and I hope so. It's just not my cup of tea, unfortunately.<br />6-1-04	2004-06-01

I have never read Al Franken's books before ~~ never heard of him till someone in another article complained about how bad his book is (Lies and The Lying Liars Who Tell Them) ~~ which made me pick this book up. I have to agree with Franken on most points ~~ as a former worker in the media, it is easy to take quotes out of context and make up stories to shock the reader. <br />I am now a Franken fan.

I picked it up and thought, oh great, it's about baseball. How wrong was I when I picked this one up at a bookstore? So I put it down. A few days later, after finding myself at loose ends because nothing I picked up sounded good, I gave it a try again. And this time, I was hooked. Terry Kay's writing just ensared me and I couldn't put the book down till the last page was turned.<br />Kay's characters just came alive in this book ~~ their dreams, their passions, their loves and fears. This is an wonderful book that will haunt you with its lyrical writing and true characters. There is Ben who is kicked off the Augusta baseball team at the same time as Foster Lanier, an older baseball player. They meet up again on the way home from the baseball fields. Ben struggles to make a life again in his hometown, Jericho, as he struggles with ending his dreams of playing baseball. Throughout his life, he kept track of his best friend Milo who did remain behind to play ball and eventually played for Boston Red Sox. Then there is Lottie, the woman he meets on his journey home ~~ and he continues to meet her over the years. And this is their story ~~ of friendship and eventually taking Lottie home. Foster married Lottie and fathered her son, but Ben took her home. <br />It's an enchanting story of the deep South at the beginning of the 20th century. These characters are just as real as your grandparents were ~~ and very interesting too. It's a great book to read on a lazy day swinging on the hammock ~~ just be prepared with lemonade and cookies ~~ once you start reading this book, you don't want it to stop!<br />5-25-04	2004-05-26

There is Sara and Brian, her parents who have been caught in this medical nightmare for years. There is Jesse, the girls' older brother who has been shoved aside because of Kate's illness. This is a fight for Kate's cure ~~ at the cost of severing family relationships. There is Campbell, the attorney who decided to take on Anna's case and Julia, a former love interest who is also appointed by the court to be Anna's guardian. Their voices entwined and weave a compelling story that keeps the reader hooked from the first page. It makes the reader question ~~ what would I do in Sara's shoes or Anna's shoes? Or what if ... it's a soul-searching novel. You cannot read this and walk away unscathed. It's impossible to read any of Picoult's books without stopping to think of what could be.<br />If you're looking for a light read, then do not read this book. In some ways, this is Picoult's darkest novel and in other ways, it is her most redeeming novel. She brings the truth out of the dark places and makes you face it. Then sometimes, there is redemption when you least expect it.<br />This is perhaps her finest novel. If you're a Picoult fan, don't be shy in getting this one.<br />5-14-04	2004-05-15

It is about women bonding together in times of duress and in times of joy. But mostly, it is about Lily and her tribulations and trimpuhs ~~ and growing up in the deep South in the 60s just as the Civil Rights Movement began. It's an interesting novel and one to share with others. It's definitely a good book club reading choice!<br />5-9-04	2004-05-10

Just be sure to have enough suntan/sunscreen lotion nearby because once you open the first page, you won't be able to put it down! <br />There is JoJo, a literary agent/ex-policewoman. There is Gemma, a party planner in Ireland and there's Lily who Gemma claims that she \\"stole\\" her true love from. JoJo is the common denominator between the three characters ~~ she is Lily's agent and who got her first book to sell. Then Gemma's best friend sent JoJo her emails ~~ the ones Gemma wrote after her dad left her mom. All three of them falls in love and their love lives are just as interesting as their literary lives. And this is the story of three women over the course of a single year.<br />It's funny and sweet, nice and comfy and just a perfect Keyes book as to be expected! I can honestly say that I have read every single one of her books and love them all. She's one of my absolute favorite authors! <br />This is a not-to-be-missed read of the summer!

I have read Gracelin O'Malley and just fell in love with Moore's book ~~ and this book is just as good if not better than her first novel. This time, Gracelin manages to escape Ireland during the famine and the fever was raging through the countryside when Julia Martin takes Gracelin to Liverpool to take her to the ship that will take her to America to join Sean, her brother. This is just the beginning of the stories of Barbara, Morgan's sister who turned nun, of Julia who is taking care of Gracelin's son, of Liam Kelley who lost his mother and sister on the ship crossing, of Sean, Gracelin's brother ~~ and so forth. Gracelin, now known as Grace, is more mature in this novel and more responsible but not any less gracious or loving. She's truly an inspiration for all strong women who have to survive hardships!<br />After finishing this book ~~ I cannot wait for the third one to come out! This author will probably be my bookclub's favorite author so far ~~ which is thrilling because Moore writes beautifully and wonderfully about Ireland and the Irish.<br />This is highly recommended reading ~~ if you like historical fiction, you will love this. If you like reading about the Irish, this book is for you. It's beautifully written ~~ poetical in some places and the story is enthralling where it takes you on journeys you've never dreamed of. This book is also full of hope and dreams ~~ more than Gracelin O'Malley was. It's also a keeper.<br />4-14-04	2004-04-15

This is a detailed look into one family's life ~~ before, during and after the middle child dies. Actually, this book is more of reminisces ~~ a cluster of stories that revolved around the dead character as well as each individual characters' lives. <br />It's an interesting book ~~ but it did feel like it was dragging on too long in some places. It's depressing but uplifting at the same time. It's a look at the complicatated relationships between mother and son, husband and wife, wife and inlaws, brothers and sister, friends and so on. It's very fascinating ~~ a glimpse into people's private lives. The Quicks will be a family that you won't soon forget. There is Lily, the mother, Ralph, her husband, Clare, her daughter, Julia, Clare's friend from childhood on, Snow, the daughter-in-law and mother of the only grandchild, Felix, Clare's lover, Rafe, the younger brother and Theo, the middle child who kills himself and his girlfriend, leaving behind broken family ties that his family had to begin to ravel together again. <br />It's a book on life and grief and hope. It's well-written and thoughtful ~~ but it could have gone at least a 150 pages less ~~ but that's just my opinion. <br />3-30-04	2004-03-31

Don't get me wrong, this is perfectly entertainable and wonderfully written, and it's great for a beach read ~~ but it's not her best novel. <br />Sloan is a police officer in a small Florida town ~~ separated from her father and sister ever since she was an infant. One day she receives an invitation to meet with her father, a world-known socialite and her sister, Paris. She wasn't planning to go till the FBI agent persuaded her to go, taking him with her. And that is when the story starts.<br />It is a sweet story ~~ but not very suspenseful and not very intriguing ~~ but still, you find yourself reading it anyhow since Judith manages to snare you into the story. It's a sweet novel.<br />3-25-04	2004-03-26

It is also slow-going at first, then it picks up then all of a sudden, the story drops off and leaves the reader slightly disappointed. Also, once again, Jewell seems to be obssessed with potty humor ~~ and it's a big turn-off for me (the bad language is typical for this sort of novel and not as grating as it would have been with a different author). <br />Ana Wills is sent to London by her mother to gather her sister's belongings and bring it home ~~ only when Ana arrives in London, she meets two of her sister's friends and stayed to solve the mystery of her sister's sudden death. Bee, her sister, is a pop star famous in the 80s ~~ then all of a sudden, her fame dies out and Ana is left to figure out who Bee is. And this is Ana's story ~~ as well as Bee's story entertwined as these two sisters grew up apart from one another. It's Bee's secret too that comes to light. Ana also comes to find love with Bee's best friend, Flint, and finding herself in the process as well.<br />It's an amusing story ~~ pleasant beach-reading time as well. It's not as good as Thirtysomething, which was my favorite Jewell novel. But it's pleasant and quick and fun.<br />3-24-04	2004-03-25

It is a look into little-mentioned bit of history, The Thirty-Year War that was set in Germany during the 1700s between the Catholics and the Protestants. Meyer writes of a family in the midst of a war-torn country striving to survive and escape the bloodbath. This is a war where brother fights brother, father against son and so forth ~~ and this family narrates their harrowing tale to flight of freedom.<br />It is an interesting book and great for beginners who may not be that interested in history ~~ though once after you've read this book, you will be intrigued enough to read more on The Thirty-Year War. <br />3-21-04	2004-03-22

I love reading about Ayla and Jondular ~~ I love reading about the craftwork, the hunting, and how they survive in prehistoric times but there wasn't much new in this novel and she left it hanging ~~ so I am assuming that there will be a sixth book in the series. <br />If you're interested in prehistoric times, start with the Clan of the Cave Bear, The Valley of Horses, and Mammoth Hunters ~~ they are the best novels in the series. Also, they're not so focused on the sexual aspect of Ayla's life, like her two last novels (including this one). If you want to read more on romance, this book is for you! <br />It's an ok novel ~~ not the greatest and not the best. I haven't given up on Auel yet ~~ I am anxiously waiting for the next one!<br />3-12-04	2004-03-17

This is the second one I've read and I really enjoyed it. You have family, humor and sass all tied into one novel and it makes for a quick and delightful reading!<br />There is Caroline who is happily married to her husband of over 40 years, Tom, who is a public defender. Daunted by the fact that their only daughter is engaged to a rich man in town ~~ they try to figure out ways to help pay for a lavish wedding. To top it off, their house is in process of being rebuilt ~~ after getting an order in for a &quot;Florida&quot; room, the contractor discovered that their foundation is cracking. He'd get to it when he can among all the other jobs he had lined up. To throw this in the mix, Caroline's sister, Taffy, is coming up for a visit since her husband left her for a woman who is two years younger than their daughter. To add even to the interesting mix is more romance ~~ Caroline's daughter becomes involved with two men while trying to make up her mind about whom to marry. Then there is Caroline's youngest son, in law school and teaching dance classes. <br />Caroline does the only thing she knows how ~~ taking refuge in her dancing studio. And the problems all sort themselves out in a delightfully funny way. It is truly a story to read in a day ~~ it's funny and sassy and you can't put it down!<br />2-13-04	2004-02-13

Two middle-aged people who have been bitter enemies since childhood find love ~~ sounds tediously boring, doesn't it? NOPE! It is very delightful and you find yourself rooting for Julie and Romeo throughout the whole book. Where love is concerned, no one should be enemies!<br />Both are florists who own small flower shops. Julie has grown up with the memory of her father cursing Romeo's father so she embibed the hatred as well. Romeo is an only child who end up having seven children who play menancing roles in the book. One day, they were both attending a small-business seminar ~~ Julie's working to keep her shop open after her ex-husband walked out with a bridesmaid who had never been a bride ~~ and Romeo was there to get ideas to keep his business open and they run into each other and sparks began to fly ~~ only this time, it's the sparks from Cupid's arrows hitting his targets.<br />Naturally, their children and his mom become dismayed and gets involved ~~ what ensues is a hilarious book between two families. Somewhat loosely based on the traditional Shakespearan play, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; ~~ this book is just as delightful and it's not a tragedy!<br />It's a fun book ~~ a quick read! Great for the flower lover in your family or just for the romantic at heart!<br />2-13-04	2004-02-13

This book is about Anne and her tumultous childhood. She is the daughter of the &quot;Kingmaker&quot; ~~ the Earl of Warwick who helped depose Henry the Sixth from the throne and put Edward the Fourth on the throne. When a split in their friendship, Warwick fled England to put Henry the Sixth and his queen back on the throne. And Anne was caught up in the midst of this turmoil. <br />It is a delightful book that is guaranteed to draw your interest into English history. When I finished this book, I immediately picked up another book about Richard the Third so I can get some of my facts straightened out!<br />I rated it a four because it didn't have a rough sketch of the genealogy charts of the royal houses of England so I could keep all the characters straight in my head. Also, the book is somewhat rather dated in its' facts since there have been new findings reported since the book was written. But those two were the only drawbacks. <br />If you're interested in learning more of history ~~ this book is a great start! I only wish my library carried all of Plaidy's books. What a treasure find that would be!<br />2-10-04	2004-02-11

It's a sweet and delightful story that makes you forget your troubles for a time. I love novels with food themes in it ~~ the only problem is, it makes me hungry all the time! So if you're on a diet, this book is not to read ~~ it will make your mouth water at some of those cake names (and the recipes in the back too!)! <br />Ruth escapes to the center of a cake whenever she's stressed out. She's stressed out plenty ~~ a kid in college, another kid at home, a husband who lost his job, a mother who moved in with them, her father who broke both wrists and needed someone to care for him ~~ it was enough to send anyone to run screaming from their house. And what does Ruth do? She escapes by baking lots of cakes. And that was just the beginning of a career for her. <br />It's a short novel but oh so delightful to read! You keep turning the pages to keep reading more of a world that could be yours if you follow your dreams. It's one of the better novels I've read in awhile. <br />2-10-04	2004-02-11

For those of us who gave up a career to be a mom should read this book.

Julia is trying to get pregnant with her boyfriend of four years, Mark. Only thing is, she can't get pregnant and she really wants to have a baby. She couldn't pass a baby without feeling the emptiness in her heart. Without wanting one. Then given a leave of absence from work, Julia flies to New York to think things over about her relationship with Mark.<br />Then there is Maeve ~~ who doesn't want to get married and have a child. She doesn't dream of having a kid. She was finally making head way in her career and was satisfied with the way her life was going when she got pregnant from a one-night stand. <br />Then there's Sam who discovered that motherhood is more exhausting than she ever thought it would be. Like a zombie, all she does is take care of the baby and the house and that's it. She thought there would be more to motherhood than that!<br />All three of those women comes to grip with their personal issues ~~ like committment, crushes, friendships and the biggest change of all, being a mom, or in Julia's case, realizing that she isn't ready to be a mom. Every woman can relate to those three characters ~~ the fear of being tied up to a child, losing a career and changing friends, and etc. It's hilarious and a lot of &quot;a ha&quot; moments ~~ you'll find yourself nodding your head and said, yep, been there and done that! <br />It's a great fun read ~~ like Green's other work. She's definitely an author I'd keep reading of ~~ she makes her characters likeable and fun. She makes reading fun.<br />2-6-04	2004-02-07

Then when the wind blew one of her stockings off the line, a hedgehog gets in trouble when he couldn't get it off his head after he poked to see what was in the stocking. Because of his new fashion statement, the other animals in the barnyard decided to be fashionable too and \\"borrowed\\" Lisa's clothes to wear as hats. <br />The pictures are hilarious as well as beautifully-drawn! My sons love looking at her pictures. I love reading it. It's not long and drawn-out like a lot of children's books.

When he threatens to eat Henny if she doesn't lay any more eggs, Hedgie comes up with a not-so-pleasant surprise!

When I look for good books to buy and to incorporate in our holiday reading, I look for excellent illustrations with a fun story to tell. I also don't look for drawn-out stories or depressing stories. This book fits all of the criteria I had set out.<br />My boys love polar bears. This one is focused on a traveling boy with his polar bear who helps a young girl keeps the trolls away from her house and eating up all of her Christmas eve dinner.

I read it in one day ~~ and I am a SAHM with two active toddlers ~~ so it's not a heavy book to sink your teeth in. It is a fun read but it's not one of my favorite reads in recent memory. Somehow, I kept thinking of Olivia Goldsmith's &quot;First Wives' Club&quot; when I was reading this book. There are so many similar things with this book and Goldsmith's. <br />There are four women who are in their 50s and 60s. Preoccupied with their aging bodies, wrinkles, and envying the younger women who are vying for their husbands/boyfriends/colleagues' attention, they decided to form a club called &quot;The Hot Flash Club.&quot; They meet at a mutual friend's retirement party ~~ and became friends by accident. And this is their stories. One woman's son-in-law is having an affair with his secretary. Another woman wants to own her own business. The third woman wants to make sure her son's finacee is really in love with him. The fourth woman wants to keep her job at all costs. <br />This is a fun read but there are too many threads left hanging ~~ so don't expect this to be a stellar novel that Thayer is known for. The author is too focused on the &quot;image&quot; appeal of this book ~~ instead of being funny, she manages to make me feel depressed about growing old. It is funny at first then it became tedious as the novel moves on. But there can't be much wrong if I can read this in one day!<br />2-4-04	2004-02-05

In spite of her &quot;otherness&quot; Ayla is adopted into the clan. And that is just the beginning of her tribulations and trimuphs. Ayla is not perfect but she's such a fascinating character to read ~~ I don't care if she's almost perfect. I can escape into her story and be glad of a cozy fire at my feet while the wind is howling outside!<br />If you're interested in historical fiction with a good story ~~ this book is it. It's engrossing and full of rich details of primitive lifestyle ~~ it makes you wonder if they really are that different from all of us. They live, hunt, eat, love and bear babies and die ~~ like us. Just their tools and surroundings are a lot cruder than our living standards. It's a great book to escape into. Perfect for those long winter nights.<br />2-2-04	2004-02-03

It's beautifully written and I enjoyed it more so the second time around ~~ especially since I had gotten married since the first time I read it. However, like a lot of Oprah's other selections, it is rather depressing. Ok, maybe depressing is the wrong word to use. It is very realistic look at life in the early 1900s when life is still tough and hard, especially for mountainfolks who have no money for medicines and knowledge. <br />Julie is a hardworking woman who meets Hank and agrees to marry him. They moved to Gap Creek where Hank got a job in a mill. They rented a house with Mr. Pendergast where Julie's job is to take care of the house and their landlord. Through a series of unfortunate mishaps, Mr. Pendergast dies, Hank loses his job and Julie gets pregnant. Together, the naive couple struggle to survive the harsh winter ~~ where a huge flood destroyed most of their food crops that they had saved for winter ~~ and together, they find an inner strength they didn't know they had. They basically grew up, as most newlyweds do when they leave home for the first time. <br />It is a realistic look at life. Marriage is not about roses and sweet dreams coming true. It really is a marriage of two minds melding together in spite of obstacles placed in their ways. This is a marriage about survival. They needed one another to survive that first year. And together, they will beat the odds for as long as it takes.<br />I enjoyed it ~~ even the rather descriptive details about farm life and having to butcher your own animals for meals. However, that time wasn't too long ago that we haven't forgotten it. It's a rich look into life that once was and reminds us of how good we have it now.<br />1-30-04	2004-01-31

This book is a guarantee to make you reminisce and cry and laugh along with Sharon Randall as she writes of her life. It is beautifully written, short and direct ~~ always having her short stories end with a rememberable last line that leaves you thinking more. <br />I found this languishing on my bookshelf after borrowing it from my mom last year. I needed something &quot;lighter&quot; to read after my spree of historical fiction. I thought this one was rather a slim volume and I can surprise my mom by returning it this weekend. But it was a surprise to me! For such a small volume, this woman writes with a punch ~~ a punch to the soul. She shouts, cajoles and whispers to your memories and soul with grace and humor. Just like a mom and wife, daughter and sister and granddaughter. I only wish I had a bigger box of kleenexes nearby. I also couldn't put the book down after reading the foreword by her son. <br />Now that I know why my local newspaper carry her column, I will be reading her work again and again. She speaks to the mother and wife inside of me. She makes me sit and remember who I was long before I have gotten to this part of my journey. She talks as if you're sitting next to her with a cup of tea and you both are just gabbing away ~~ only her stories serve to remind you that life is short and it is even more precious than we all realize. This is a book that should be shared, not hoarded in dusty libraries or in the back of the bookcase. This is a book that everyone should give to their loved ones ~~ male or female. It speaks to all of us. <br />I just love writers like Sharon Randall ~~ they really speak and it is up to us to really listen ~~ with our ears and our hearts.<br />1-28-04	2004-01-29

This is perhaps one of the most intense historical fiction novels I have read in a long time. It is so well-written, that I keep glancing through my Native American Indian history books to gather more information about Black Hawke and General Henry Atkinson. This novel really has renewed my interest in Native American history. <br />Mary Bullitt agrees to marry General Henry Atkinson after knowing him one day. She moves from Louisville, Kentucky, to St. Lois ~~ at that time, a frontier-town in what was known as the West. This novel is based on Mary's journals. It is also a novel rich in details of life in the early 1800s to the mid-1800s. It also explores the question of Indian rights that were being violated at the time and other people's misconception of the Indian Wars. <br />Mary and her General kept me riveted through the pages and transported me back to the early beginnings of this country. It reminds me of man's greed ~~ to conquer all he sees and how others fight it. It brought me to the realization that life was tenous during those times ~~ as well as being more intense as well. The scenery descriptions and actual lifestyle habits of the times are so well-researched, that I actually felt like I was there as an observer. <br />This is a beautifully-written novel ~~ one to keep in your personal library. If you know of someone who is tenative about reading historical novels, start with this one. It is a guarantee to bring history alive in the reader's mind. <br />1-27-04	2004-01-28

I read an article in Time Magazine recently on suppositions that the Catholic Church had suppressed other &quot;gospels&quot; written by Jesus' disciples. One of them claimed to be &quot;Gospel of Mary&quot; ~~ and since I have read &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; by Dan Brown, I then became more intrigued with the one follower of Jesus, Mary. This book satisfies my curiousity without imposing on my religious beliefs. There isn't much known about Mary, faithful follower of Jesus and George did a wonderful job drawing my imagination to life in the early years of Jesus' ministry. <br />The beginning of the book starts with Mary at the age of 7 and finding an idol. Over the years, she becomes possessed by demons and when it seemed to be the bleakest, Jesus drove the demons out from her. Then Mary became one of his closest followers. This novel is of her journey and doubts, joys and trimuphs as a woman in extraordinary times. She is an ordinary woman caught up in the world's greatest mystery unrivaled by all time ~~ and blessed as well. <br />It is written beautifully and with intricate details I like to see in my historical fiction novels. It draws more of an interest in life then and makes me realize how much have changed since then as well as what has not been changed. It is a thought-provoking novel as well. It's a great addition for anyone interested in reading about strong women of different times. <br />1-27-04	2004-01-28

She spends five years there with Aisling O'Connor's family ~~ and returns back to London with a life-long best friend. This is their story of their friendship and all they've endured. Both have fallen in love and gotten married at different times of their lives, watch their mothers die and other growing-up situations that shape everyone's lives. <br />It is a great story of friendship and touches somewhat on mother-daughter relationships as well ~~ and it's fast-paced so it's great to read during those long winter evenings.

White is a wonderful story-teller. Whenever I read this book, I think of lazy summer nights by the campfire and someone telling this story to sleepy-eyed children, while the lightening bugs flicker and owls hooting in the distance. It's a great story for all ages.<br />Louis is born without a voice. He is a Trumpeter Swan and he must have a voice otherwise he won't be able to mate someday. He went to school with his friend, Sam Beaver, and learned to read and write. But that didn't help because none of the other swans knew how to read and write. So his father decided to steal a trumpet for Louis so Louis can \\"talk.\\" And the adventures for Louis begin as he works all across the USA to pay for the stolen trumpet and the damages to the store. Along the way, Louis finds his true love again and they get married.<br />It's a wonderful story about courage, honesty and bravery. Louis braved strange places and made himself a living to earn money to pay back his father's debts. It's a deeply imaginative story as well ~~ you can almost see the mist rising off the small pond in Canada in the early sunrise.<br />No matter how old you are, you are never too old to read this rich story. It's written for everyone who has an imagination. It's a must-read for serious readers ~~ it stays with you for a life-time!<br />1-12-04	2004-01-13

They all attended school in the village and the school is nestled beneath the shade of a great big copper beech tree. There is a story about the local doctor, the local priest, the schoolteachers, the poor kids and so forth.<br />Maeve weaves her spell again ~~ all you can do is give into her spell and read about ordinary people living ordinary lives with the occassional surprises and revelations. It's a lovely book to snuggle with by the fire on a blustering cold winter day. And this time, Maeve writes more thoroughly of the characters, not cutting off their stories so abruptly like several of her books have been. You can tell she really thought the characters out and how their stories entwined together like any other villages or towns. <br />It's a wonderful book to read ~~ I wouldn't hesitate reading this one again!<br />1-12-04	2004-01-12

She is only interested in two things ~~ her self-interests and her son, Joss. Sounds like a bad novel, right? Wrong. Hardie creates a complex character and a beautifully-written novel ~~ that keeps you reading from the first page to the last. It is not a fast page-turner suspense where you have to stay up all night and read till the last page is finished ~~ but it is an intense novel that keeps you guessing and thinking. Her scenery descriptions of the Irish landscape is vivid and poignant. You detect a poetress in the author when you read about the long winter twilight across the snow-covered lands. This is a beautiful book with a disturbing story.<br />Hannie comes to Ireland with her fifth husband, Ned, from Africa, a country that she has lived in for years. With a mystery surrounding Hannie and her son, they come to a northern country not knowing what to expect. Hannie has made it clear from the beginning that marriage is not for love. Because of that statement, this novel is written with a curiously heavy sense of sexual tension lying underneath, like a snake coiled in the sun waiting for darkness to descend. Slowly, each of the characters in this novel ~~ Hannie, Joss, Ned, Niamh, Mrs. Coady, and Ned's friends and relatives ~~ come to life and one begins to read about different character flaws or strengths. And the reader is hooked ~~ sometimes unwillingly ~~ into their stories.<br />If you are looking for a book that doesn't make you uncomfortable or make you think ~~ this book isn't it. Hardie writes very beautifully to keep your interest but the tension between the characters sometimes may be a bit much to take in long doses. This book is written in the classics of the old ~~ where the author writes and let the characters speak for themselves. Having just read John Steinbeck's \\"Winter of Our Discontent,\\" I can say that Hardie writes similarily to his writing style ~~ heavy at times and quite insightful ofthe human relationships. <br />I give it a five ~~ though it was not always an easy read. Hardie mentions in the interview at the back of the book that she is more inclined to write poetry and this book reflects a lot of her lyrical thought. It is a book worth reading. <br />1-6-04	2004-01-06

A friend complained to me recently that she finds Steinbeck a depressing writer ~~ I disagree. He writes realistically of the views that society has on one another and of the world. Steinbeck writes convincingly of people and this book is no exception.<br />The book focuses on Ethan, a descendant from the Pilgrims and of the whaling captains, reduced to semi-poverty by working for an Italian immigrant in the grocery store he used to own. His wife, Mary, complains of not having money to spend as well as his two children. Beset by memories of how it used to be, Ethan begins to look for a way to solve his problems. This book focuses on that attempt. Ethan is a lovable character ~~ he defuses every serious conversations or whining with humor, oftentimes at the expense of his good self-will and pride.<br />It is a journey into one man's soul and it's soul-wrenching as well. It makes you stop and think ~~ and you don't dare to criticize anyone because you're guilty of the same feelings of despair and defeat. Ethan struggles to find a way to deal with those expectations and dreams of his loved ones and still keep his pride. But it comes to a conclusion that he can't have both.<br />This may be a smaller book but one still grabs at your soul and your mind. It's a perfect addition to any serious reader's library.<br />1-3-04	2004-01-03

Once I got through Daisy's childhood, the reading became more diverse and more imaginative, very rich in detail of the inner life of a woman growing up in the early and mid Twentieth Century.<br />It is a beautifully written novel ~~ and Daisy is a character richly drawn ~~ but the book just didn't capture my interest like other novels did. However, I don't regret picking this novel up to read. I've heard so much about it and was glad to know that there are still good books out there.

When I found this book, I had heard of some of my reading buddies read it before and they seemed to have enjoyed it! And this book is just darling! It's fun and funny and just great! I could have kept reading it again and again! <br />Jasmin Fields, a writer, meets her sister George and her flatmate, Mo, at an audition that Harry Noble is happening to produce in. Somehow, she auditions and get the part of Lizzy. However, she had heard Harry Noble call her the &quot;ulgy sister&quot; so it inflamed her and ignited her to do her audition perfectly and thus, there's the book.

Her life ends up being full ~~ Mo falls in love with another journalist, George falls in love and out. Their youngest sister struggles with a &quot;perfect marriage&quot; that Jasmin has based her columns on. And so forth. <br />Sometimes, there is hilarity in the stories and struggles ~~ and sometimes there is profound thought to be found ~~ it is just an entertaining story and one that makes you wish for a sequel. <br />It's a great winter read ~~ fun and fast and easy to read ~~ yet it still keeps you thinking after the last page is turned.<br />12-23-03	2003-12-24

I just glanced over the other reviews and some reviewers were offended by the bodice-ripping in the first few chapters ~~ I have a piece of advice for you ~~ keep reading. I, too, thought this was another one of those heaving bare-bosoms novels ~~ a bodice ripper but it's not. In fact, I think there were only a few sexual scenes written in this novel after the first few chapters. So even if you're not interested in bodice rippers, I still wouldn't give up this novel at all.<br />This is an incredibly satisfying read of Elizabeth, my favorite queen in history, and about her mother, who is much-maligned. It is written in an orderly fashion and the emotion that Maxwell poured into this novel is noticable ~~ these are people that history has made her stamp on ~~ and while Anne is known more for her beheading and siring a queen, there isn't much known about her. And this book provides a glimpse into the queen that mothered Elizabeth, an incredibly strong woman then and now. <br />I have read several nonfictions on Henry the Eighth and his wives, and on Elizabeth as well. This book is about Anne and her story as Maxwell tried to imagine. Now, I am not sure about all the accuracy in the historical facts, but at this point, I really don't care. It's a satisfying read and one I really enjoyed. I highly recommend this one to everyone!<br />12-18-03	2003-12-19

I really enjoyed this novel.<br />It is about two women with secrets held deep inside them and by chance, they met at a garden center. There is Mira, a Chilean refugee from Chile who escaped to Sweden during the uprising. There is Inge, a native-born Swedish woman who is divorced and her two daughters are in London in school. Mira is also divorced and while her husband is rarely mentioned in this novel, he was somewhat central to all that has happened in the past. And these two women begin a long friendship based on mutal respect and trust.<br />This is a lovely book ~~ written lyrically and beautifully. Fredriksson draws the two characters with emotion and feeling and depths ~~ she introduces nightmares that every woman fears and how they both overcome it. They have discovered an inner strength within and found themselves more open and fragile as a result.<br />If you enjoy books written about friendships, this book is for you. <br />12-18-03	2003-12-19

Told from Hanna's point of view and at different ages, the people in that town becomes alive through her eyes. She makes them real. She makes their stories real and valid. <br />It is an emotional book ~~ where her housekeeper's son finds out he's illegimate; where she watches her childhood friend raped by her grandfather give up the baby she had come to love; watches her neighbor in the apartment above them give himself to man after man who degrades him. And other stories as well.<br />This is a book perfect for reading groups to read and to discuss ~~ there are lots of different stories in here and it's not written poorly like too many other books out there today.<br />12-18-03	2003-12-19

I am a fan of historical fiction and I really enjoyed this. It has smatterings of all the women in Shakespeare's lives ~~ starting from his mother to his wife, Anne, and friends, daughters, characters from his plays, and lastly, the Queen Bess.<br />This is a well-written book of short stories. I normally don't care for short stories but I do enjoy these! There is a chapter devoted to Lady MacBeth and you'd see where her love for her husband shines through as well as her ambition. There is Juliet's mother who is in love with Romeo's father. There are letters between the playwright and his daughters and wife. <br />The stories focus on different aspects of women and Shakespeare's muse seems to be all the women in his life. There is his wife, a lusty woman who he left behind. There is a friend whom he has fallen in love with but never touched improperly except once. There are his daughters. There is his landlord's daughter who adored him from afar. All these women and Shakespeare borrowed from them to write his famous plays to make each character human.<br />It is an interesting book ~~ and easily readable! I found this by accident and now I am looking forward to reading more of this author's books.<br />12-18-03	2003-12-19

I don't have a daughter ~~ and after reading this book, I want to have a little girl with red hair like my sons and like Anne. =0) What a delightful character ~~ even when she seems to be vexing with all that chatter ~~ she's still a delightful person you would love to know in real life.<br />I have read this book when I was a girl and re-reading it again as an adult is still a wonderful journey. How a young girl with lots of imagination still takes the world ~~ at least Avonlea ~~ by a storm. Where a young girl is mistakenly dropped off at the train station ~~ when Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert had asked for a boy to help Matthew on the farm ~~ ends up being part of fate and the brother and sister who adopted her ended up being grateful that Anne came to live with them.<br />It is also a well-written book with lots of big words ~~ it's great story to encourage kids to read and it's a great moralistic story as well. It is a book that I will encourage my boys to read as well ~~ it's just pure fun. It makes learning fun.<br />I am glad this one is part of my classic library ~~ it's a treasure.<br />12-8-03	2003-12-08

And Amy Thomas brings all those memories back with a hoot and a hollar! <br />Amy Thomas, a successful magazine editor, gets engaged to Stephen, a guy she's been dating for 11 months, in the line to a movie, no less. And with her best friend's encouragement, she buys this book on how to have the perfect wedding and that is when things started to snowball into mass hysterics.<br />It's cute and funny ~~ and a great read while soaking in a bath full of bubbles.

I picked this book up on a recommendation of a good friend and this is a delightful book! I love how Ephron neatly ties the beginning, the middle and the conclusion together all nice and neat ~~ which is my favorite type of reading to begin with!<br />It is a story about star-struck lovers. There is Rosemary, who is a spoiled young woman who has everything her heart desires. There is Philip, her finace, who has worked for everything he owned in spite of his illustriatous name. There is Eleanor, a poor lady, who Rosemary befriended one night in the rain ~~ she invited the poor lady home for a cup of tea and thus began a chain of events that changed everyone's lives.<br />It is a sweet little book and it is riveting enough to keep you entertained while pondering on what is going to happen. It is written in a classic style ~~ and written in the days before and during World War One. <br />It's a great stocking stuffer for the lady in your life ~~ it is one of my favorite reads this year. <br />12-2-03	2003-12-02

There are secrets involved in everyone's lives and this book is a reflection upon that. <br />There is Anna, the daughter in charge of planning the anniversary celebration, who is in love with an actor still married to his wife and mother of his sons. There is Brendan who fled England back to the Irish farmland that his father had escaped from. There is Helen, the youngest child, bent on becoming a nun in an order that doesn't even want her. There is Desmond, their father, miserable in a management level of a grocery store chain and their mother, Deirdre, who has always tried to maintain the look of happiness and perfection. And they all come to self-realizations in this novel. There is Deirdre's maid of honor, Maureen, who became a successful business woman, and there is Frank, the best man, who is the head of the grocery store chain. And other characters with a delightful insights written by Maeve. <br />This book is nice ~~ it's comfort reading, if you will. It is not, by far, her best book. She has a tendency to string her readers along for more juicy tidbits and end it promptly without revealing any more stories. It's frustrating because it leaves all the questions unanswered. So it's not as good as &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; or &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; or her others. But still, it is a comforting read. <br />It is a nice little story of people and friends of a family in England. Though it's not my favorite book, it is still an enjoyable reading.<br />12-2-03	2003-12-02

When I got the the four short stories of Dublin short stories, I was like, ok, I'll get back to the Lilac Bus ~~ and never did. It just left me hanging. <br />Maeve Binchy is a great writer ~~ she tells stories like no other writer does but this book did not do her justice at all. The stories in the Lilac Bus seems to be incomplete. There were no conclusion at all. Maybe she intends to leave the endings up to our imaginations ~~ but she barely even started a sketch with some of these characters. And I want to know more. <br />It feels like a tease ~~ come on and read my book but, ... you have to do the rest on your own. <br />This is not my favorite Binchy book ~~ not even close. Since I have read her other books, I know that this is not her typical writing. Don't be discouraged if you read this book ~~ she does have other books that are better.<br />11-25-03	2003-11-25

This one is a re-read for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it again. <br />You have different people coming into this story ~~ and with a deft hand, Binchy keeps the stories flowing into one mass conclusion at the end. You have Signora who returns from Italy to Ireland after her lover dies. You have the disappointed Latin teacher, Aidan Dunne, who is bereft of his dream job as a principal at Mountainview. You have Barry, the young kid who remembers Italy fondly. You have Lou, the class thug, who changes his life midway through the year in the class. There is Connie, the rich woman with a secret bursting to be told, Fran and Cathy, sisters or mother/daughter ~~ Fran's secret till it comes out. There is Bill, a serious banker and his finacee, Lizzy, who is a dizzy blonde. They all come together in a class to learn Italian ~~ for various reasons and because of this common ground, they all became friends and their stories are entertwined ~~ Dublin isn't the typical big city ~~ it's a city with a small-town feel to it where everyone knows your name.<br />Binchy writes with a sure hand and she creates believable characters that you relate to as a reader. Her stories are believable in most instances. This is one book that you cannot stop turning the pages ~~ it is one of my favorites this year. <br />I come to rely on Binchy's novels for pure relaxation ~~ her stories are interesting and well-written. Sometimes, when you pick up one of her novels, you feel like you're coming home to relax by the fire and hearing the local gossip of your friends and family. She is a warm writer and she gently shares those stories with you ~~ as only a good story-teller can do.<br />11-22-03	2003-11-22

I thought being a mom of active toddler twins was hectic enough ~~ but my babies are lazy compared to the high-society children. This book is funny and also disturbing and sad. The one question that resonant through my head is, why do these people have children if they don't care about them on a daily basis? Here is Nanny, a part-time nanny who takes care of Grayer X, and her job ends up being a full-time job. She isn't allowed to have a life outside of caring for Grayer. She gets involved in the mess of Mr. X's adulterous affairs and Mrs. X's preoccupation with getting manicures/pedicures. Good grief, don't these people have a life?<br />And The X's child is torn between all these people ~~ Nanny tries to leave but she is the only one who geniunely cares for the little boy in her charge. She is a graduate student working on her thesis and trying to graduate as well ~~ and her life becomes embroiled with The Xs. <br />It is funny in some spots but it's very disturbing to realize that there are people out there who expect everyone else to raise their children and fire them on the spot if they aren't doing their job. I didn't learn Latin till I was 14 ~~ and they're expected to learn Latin by the age of 4, in order to improve their chances to get in a better school. Appearances mean everything to these people ~~ but yet they don't spend any quality time with their children.<br />It makes me glad to be a middle-class mom who actually takes care of her children ~~ and knows them. Unlike those high-society people. I admire Nanny for trying to keep her job as long as possible but was relieved to see the end of that job!<br />It's an enjoyable book ~~ it is also addicting ~~ the name-dropping and the brand-names are enthralling. You can't help yourself by turning the pages to see where this is going. <br />11-19-03	2003-11-19

I don't know how I got this copy of After Anne ~~ but however I got it, I am so glad I read it! This is one of my all-time favorite read ~~ much to my surprise! <br />I didn't realize this is an inspirational book ~~ normally, I don't read those because of poor writing but this book has exceeded all expectations. It is a story of two women who became friends in an unlikely way. It is a discovery of truths on one woman's part and the facing of uncertain future on the other woman's part. It is an exploration of friendship and love that only two women can experience ~~ they became closer friends than sisters. <br />This story is rich in details ~~ Olivia is a mom and a banker's wife. She endures trouble with her teenage son and pretween daughter when she meets Anne. Anne is a soon-to-be mom in her late 20s who discovers a lump on her breast. Together, they share their lives. Their friendship is the one that every woman secretly dreams of having ~~ and while it strengthens Anne's walk with God, it introduces God and his word to Olivia. However, that is done in a beautifully-written way, not a preachy way. Anne lived her faith. Olivia learns about it just from watching Anne. <br />I just love this book ~~ I relate to Olivia so well though my babies aren't grown yet. I relate to Anne and her fears and uncertainities of the future ~~ and it's just a beautiful, heart-warming story. It is definitely one of the best-written stories on friendship that I have ever read. It makes me think of my best friend and our friendship over the years. It also makes me look at my children differently ~~ they too will grow up like Olivia's children did. I also appreciate the little things in life more ~~ you just never know what to expect ~~ and how fast time is.<br />This is a definite book to buy for your best friend or wife or daughter. It's not emotionally mushy though in some places you will need a kleenex. It is just beautifully-written ~~ and so true. It makes you stop and think. It is one of the must-reads for the coming year if not tomorrow.<br />11-11-03	2003-11-11

I love books about friendships between women and this book is one of the best books I have read on this subject! It is not an all-warm and giggly type of book ~~ just four women who wound up living together in one of their worst times of life ~~ and bonded tighter than most sisters do. Talk about sisterhood!<br />Phoebe inherits a flower farm in California from her aunt. Daunted by the care of the farm ~~ she meets Ness, a homeless horse shoer and her horse, Elroy. Together they came up with a plan to fill up the farmhouse and get the farm going again. There is Nancy, a woman rejected by her lover and Beryle who had served time for killing her abusive husband. Together, they pulled together to get the first cash crop ~~ poinsettas ~~ off the ground and along the way, they not only learned about plants and gardening but about friendship. They also discover what surprises life throws them their way.<br />It is a heart-warming tale of four unique women ~~ the reader will identify with each of them in one way or the other. It is a great book to lend to your best friend or mom or sister. It is a great book to read in bed when you're sick ~~ that is how I survived the flu bug! Their stories will transport you into a different time and you just know that life can be better.<br />11-9-03	2003-11-10

I am also a fan of family sagas ~~ and this one did not fail me! <br />This is a tale about Aurora and the choices she made in her life. Facing her death, she tells Philip, a reknowned reporter, her story. And what a story it is! From the lush tropical days of the late 1800s to mid-1900s ~~ Aurora lives a life of regret, love and sorrow. She gave up her daughter at birth to her lover and repined over that choice for years even as she went on to marry and had two more sons. That single choice affected not only Aurora, but the daughter she gave up and her sons as well.<br />If you like stories with a Southern twist to it ~~ this book is it. It's a quick but heartfelt read. Richards delve into each character's heart and mind so intimately that she is able to draw the reader into their stories. It's a great read ~~ escapism read as well. Richards continue to impress me with her writing style and ideas. Rising Tides the sequel does not disappoint as well.<br />11-9-03	2003-11-10

This book is one of my favorite sequels to one of my favorite books, Iron Lace. I am a fan of sequels ~~ I am always curious to what happens in the next generation or two. How do the choices a character in a previous book affect the other characters that were barely named in the first book? It's a great concept and I think Richards did a great job exploring that in this book.<br />There are nine characters in this book and how their lives entwined make for a great reading. There is Hugh, Aurora's son, who died but his presence is still felt among the rest of the characters. There is Dawn, Hugh's niece, Aurora's granddaughter, there is Ferris, Aurora's son and his wife, Cappy. There is Philip, Nicky, his mother and Ben, Hugh's friend and the poor agiated lawyer who is executor of the will. Forced to spend four days at Aurora's favorite summer place ~~ they all discover how they are all related.<br />It makes for great entertaining reading and I loved every page of it. It is not that often when you find a author who writes well and manages to entertain you at the same time ~~ especially when you're stricken with the flu bug.<br />11-9-03	2003-11-10

Only one person who he cannot make happy and that is his wife. Lucha is a Mexican girl who has never known want or hunger. Jubilio tries everything in his power to make her happy and succeeded for many years till a tragedy drove them apart. <br />The story is told from their daughter's point of view ~~ how a man driven to please his woman loses his woman after all ~~ and the secret yearnings of all of our hearts. This is an exquistely-written novel on the heart and love between a man and a woman.<br />And this is also a reflection on a daughter's love for her father ~~ this is a must-read for every daddy's girl. Sometimes you don't realize how blessed you are till something happens. And sometimes it is too late. This is a poignant story and a reminder that life is ever-fleeting. <br />Even though it's not written in the same calibar as Like Water for Chocolate, it is still a lovely tome to add to your library or reading list. Sometimes one needs a small novel to remind us of the important things in life.<br />10-31-03	2003-11-01

With all those characters and the switching back and forth, it wasn't confusing at all ~~ especially since she put the year in front of the paragraphs when she switches gear. It is a fun book ~~ very intriguing and suspenseful! <br />Catherine is approached by a friend to secure pieces of an old chess set for an antique collection, especially since her job was to take her to Algeria. There is a legend buried with this chess set and in her travels, Catherine learns the legend and finds herself in danger.

In the midst of turmoil and unrest, Mirielle is entrusted with making sure that the chess pieces didn't fall into the wrong hands. There were so many men who hunger for the power this ancient chess set could provide them if only they knew the secret behind it. <br />And that begins a fascinating tale of suspense!

The lavish descriptions of life inside Queen Isabella's court, the crusades against the Moors, the Inquisitions, true love found and lost, dreams broken and renewed ~~ this is the stuff made of dreams ~~ that comes true and sometimes, lost.<br />It is not only a story about Christopher Columbus and his pursuit to find a new way to the Indies; it is also a story about a Grandee who finds out a secret that would damn him in the Inquisitions courts and as a result, he loses his true love. It is also a story about a gypsy, a mapmaker/scribe, the woman they both love; it is a story about Christopher Columbus' love and family ~~ it is a story about life. <br />Wiggs writes with a lavish detail of the Spanish life and of Isabella's dream that she shares with Columbus. It tells of Columbus cooling his heels at the court for 7 long years. It tells of his despair that his dreams will never be realized. It talks of Santiago, the gypsy roamer and his best friend, Rafael. It tells of their love for Catalina, a doctor. <br />It is a wonderful book to escape into ~~ but while it is entertaining like most historical fictions are ~~ I am dubious to all the facts being accurate.

We later commented on the fact that it's our favorite fairy tale. The pictures are beautifully-illustrated and with fine details. The story itself is beautifully-written and entertaining for our little boys. It is a keeper in our collection!<br />The Czar orders his three sons to shoot an arrow and whoever is holding it wherever it landed will be that son's bride. The youngest got stuck with a talking frog. He was rather disappointed, but his bride wasn't who he thought she was. Because of his ineptness, he lost her and had to find her again. The basic moral of this story is true love always prevails. And it's a neat fairy tale ~~ a readaption of the ancient Russian folklore.<br />If you are interested in having your children learn more about different cultures and their stories, this is a good place to start. With beautiful illustrations and a lovely story, your children will be entertained just as you will be.<br />10-15-03	2003-10-14

I am able to inflect different meanings to different things every time I read this book to them. It's a fun and great book on words. I read it to my nephew 10 years ago and I am still enthralled with this book. <br />If you are looking for a book that will keep your children's attention while you're reading ~~ this book is it. It has more of a rhyming to it than his others. It's fun and sassy and bold. Perfect for kids learning to read too!

With a first sentence like this: <br />    &quot;Ross Wakeman succeeded the first time he killed himself, but not the second or the third.&quot;<br />One would think this is a depressing book. It's not. It's a very different type of reading ~~ with different characters scattered who knows where but it all comes together nicely. They all have one thing in common and that is the real mystery of the novel. Ross, Shelby, Ethan, Eli, Az, Meredith, Lucy, Ruby, Spencer and Lia all have a story to tell and how it is all connected, Picoult does her painstakingly thorough work as usual to tie them all together. And I am not disappointed with the results! <br />Be patient is what I would say about this book. There are a lot of characters in this book, and sometimes it seems like Picoult gives the reader too much information about them or sometimes it seems repetitive but it's not. She really gives a good insight of each character and you find yourself turning the page hoping for more indepths to the characters. You find yourself sitting up late at night guessing the truth and finding out that it wasn't so predictable after all. <br />The theme of this novel is about love and ghosts. It is also about people solving a 70-year old murder mystery. It is about people losing the ones they love and finding love again in mysterious ways. Lies unravel in the face of the truth. Dreams get shattered and broken in this novel then painstakingly brought back together again. It is a good insight on love and relationships and the paranormal has a big part in how this book flows together. This is one of the best Picoult novels I have yet read (I've read them all). I am looking forward to more of her books since she has not failed to meet my expectations! <br />Grab this one without delay ~~ it's perfect fall reading. Just to be sure to snuggle under your blanket and be prepared to be swept away by Picoult's lyrical writings.<br />10-13-03	2003-10-13

Ave Maria and Etta grows up over the years together. Etta resists her mother's attempts to make her over into a different person and Ave Maria resists the fact that her baby is growing up. It is a wonderful book about growing up, loving and learning to let go. <br />All of the main characters are still in this book though they, too, have grown older. Iva Lou is still the loyal best friend though she undergoes a crisis of her own. Spec is still the crusty father-figure for Ave. Theodore is still the best friend, only now he lives in New York and happily in love. Fleeta is still the crusty woman who wows everyone with her baking skills. Pearl is still the young girl that Ave befriended, only she is married and has a child of her own. Jack is still Ave's husband and this time, the tension between them is not there. They too have grown up together over the years. <br />This is a bittersweet story of friends and family growing together as a child comes of age. No matter where they are, the gorgeous mountains ~~ either of Gap Creek or of the Italy Alps ~~ are in the background. This book is more lyrically-written as if the author has come into her own and found her voice. It is a sweet novel ~~ one that makes you wish for more after the last page is turned. If this is the finale of the Big Stone Gap series, then it is worth every drop of tears I've shed on this one!<br />10-3-03	2003-10-04

It has been years since I've read any of Grace Livingston Hill's books ~~ my great-grandmother would read them to me and loaned me her books. And this one is one of my favorites. I found it in a library booksale and snapped it up. Reading it again reminds me of a happier time in life. <br />Camilla meets Jeffrey, a young millionare at the scene of an accident. She had been racing to get to the doctor's office to get medicine for her mother ~~ and since her car was totaled in the accident, Jeffrey offers to help her out. And this is just the beginning of a truly lovely romance.<br />Romance isn't written like this anymore. I was very young when I first read this one and re-reading it again, it still holds a special appeal to me. This is the way romance should be written ~~ with grace and humor and love. It is spiritual but not crass like a lot of inspirational books nowadays. This is a book I'd loan to my nieces if they were interested.<br />This is a definite picker-upper for your library!<br />10-3-03	2003-10-04

I first read this book to my twins today ~~ I know they're still young but I want to start reading books that has lessons in it. This one should be a classic! <br />Mr. Toad wakes up after a long winter nap. He goes walking to find a wife. Only on the way to the pond, he comes onto a road and almost gets smashed by an oncoming car. Why? Because he didn't stop, look and listen!<br />This book teaches children how to cross the road safely so they won't get run over by drivers who may not be able to see them. Basically, it teaches you to stop before you cross the road, look left and look right and look left again to make sure there is no car coming and you listen for the car too. Then when all is clear, then it's safe to cross the street.<br />This book is illustrated beautifully ~~ even I like it. The story is cute and importantly, it is entertaining even if it is a lesson book!<br />10-2-03	2003-10-03

I just picked it up today to read it to my twins and while they're entertained by me reading it, I totally love reading it to them! This is a beautifully illustrated book with a cute story ~~ we all should accept one another even if we are different. <br />Hodges' duck is annoying but one Friday night, when three Tigers came in, the duck counter them with his own challenge after every insult that the Tigers give out. Then a food fight melee breaks out ~~ and that is when the Tigers realized that hey, food doesn't have to be pigs or elephants or even ducks! Hodges' cooking and his duck save the day. <br />It is a very entertaining book and very cute. It is going to be a definite bedtime story for these guys from now on!<br />10-2-03	2003-10-03

It wasn't what I expected ~~ for one thing, it skipped over 8 years in Ava's life. There were several storylines in this book that were loosely threaded together and sometimes, it was barely even touched upon. For instances, when Ava came home from Italy, the author barely even skim over the issues on why Ava and Jack agreed to be apart for awhile. In this book, Ava was more wishy-washy than strong and determined. There weren't that much humor in this book. And it seemed to be a rushed and hurried job.<br />Ava takes her daughter, Etta, home to Italy to meet her grandfather and grandmother ~~ Jack was originally supposed to go with them but at the last minute, he decides to stay home. While in Italy, Ava meets a dashing American, Pete, and had to choose between two men. This is the basic plot of the story. <br />If you're looking for a light entertaining read, this book would be it. But if you're looking for a more substantsial book, this isn't it. This one barely glimmed over the relationships Ava has with her best friend, Iva Lou and Fleeta, and other characters from Big Stone Gap. Sometimes the story just doesn't go as well as it should have. It's an ok book from an exceptional author. Hopefully, Milk Glass Moon holds more promise than this one.<br />10-1-03	2003-10-01

I am so eternally grateful that I do not have a job like Andrea Sachs in this book. All that hours catering to a fashion editor's job and having to hear &quot;Millions of girls would die to have a job just like yours!&quot; 24/7 ~~ no thanks! I'll pass up on the Guccis and Pradas and meeting celebrities at parties and everything that passes for entertainment in the fashion world. <br />Ok, I know this book isn't the classic novel that people seem to be expecting ~~ I expected it to be an entertaining and fun read and Weisberger didn't disappoint me here! Full of witty remarks (and catty ones to!) and heavy on the sarcasm, I really enjoyed reading this book about Andrea Sachs who got hired just out of college to work at Runway, one of the fashion world's premier magazines. And not only was she hired there, she was also hired to work for Miranda Priestly, the fashion world's &quot;it&quot; woman, who is the fashion editor of Runway. Andrea heard that if she survived one year at that grueling indentureship, Miranda will see to it that she will get any job that she wants. Any job and there is nothing more that Andrea wants in the world other than to work for The New Yorker. So Andrea agreed to work for her for a year. Little did she know what that year entailed.<br />Andrea was literally on call 24/7 as her boss' junior assistant. She was ordered to fetch coffee, newspapers and magazines every day like a latch-key. She had to field requests from everyone that wants to meet with Miranda. And she also has to anticipate every demand that Miranda might have ~~ as well as sorting through her dirty clothes to ready for dry-cleaning. Trying to keep her sense of humor, and trying to keep her relationships with her family, boyfriend and best friend ~~ Andrea begins to wonder if this is worth all the aggravation. <br />It is, like I mentioned, a highly entertaining read. It's actually nicer to read about someone else's problems with their boss. Weisenberger does it with grace andhumor. This is one of the funnest reads I've had this fall. If you're not expecting it to be a serious tome on the fashion world, this book is for you. <br />9-28-03	2003-09-29

He doesn't mean to but he just does. No matter what he does, he falls or disturbs something. One year, the fireflies that always bring spring never came. People started losing hope that summer would never come again. Jack gets teased by some kids in town when he kept falling on the ice while ice-skating. So he runs away. And that is the beginning of a lovely story.<br />This story brings to the point of how sometimes when you're the most clumsiest, that is when you are full of life and grace. It doesn't matter who you are ~~ and no matter how clumsy you are, there will always be someone who loves you. This story illustrates that. <br />It is a lovely story ~~ perfect to give to the one you love and to your children to share over and over. It'd make a wonderful Christmas present...	2003-09-26

This is an absolutely stunning book ~~ beautifully written and with insightful looks between a mother and her daughter and the forces of nature. At first glance, it looks like a typical feminine contemporary novel ~~ but Monroe writes with a haunting sense of self as she presents this story. <br />Lovie knows she's dying and before she dies, she wants to reconcile with her daughter whom she hasn't seen much of in 20 years. Cara, named Caretta ~~ after a turtle ~~ has lived in Chicago after leaving the house in a rage with her father. Olivia begs Cara to come home and asked her to help her do some cleaning out. Cara comes home ~~ because she just lost her job. And that is when the story begins.<br />There is Toy, Lovie's companion. She's dealing with problems of her own ~~ found at a shelter by a friend of Lovie's, she came to live with Lovie as she goes through her pregnancy. In love with a man who doesn't love her, Toy isn't sure what to expect of her future. Then there is Palmer, Lovie's son and Cara's brother ~~ he doesn't think along the same ways as the ladies do. He's money-hungry and always looking for a good deal. There is Brett, a long-time friend of the family. He meets Cara again and sparks begin to fly. Then there is the Turtle Ladies ~~ always on the lookout to help the loggerhead turtles nest and move their nests if possible. They may be volunteers and Lovie is in charge of them ~~ their friendships rekindled over the summer. And this is the story between Lovie and Cara ~~ as they comes to grips with Lovie's upcoming death and bridging the gap between the years. <br />It is a beautiful story meant for mothers and daughters to share and relate to. It has enough scenery in there that makes you long to live in St. Palm Isles as well. It is just a poignant story that will grip your heart and won't let go till you have turned the last page. I highly recommend this one for every woman who longs for a lovely story.<br />9-24-03	2003-09-25

I am a devoted Joy Fielding fan and this book is not quite what I expected. It does have an unusual twist at the end ~~ and the character, Terry Painter, is so incredibly annoying ~~ so naive and so gullible. I had a hard time finding any reason to like her. But, the writing is good like always and the suspense is there to keep me turning the pages. But this is not Joy's best book. Far from it.<br />Terry Painter is a 40-year-old nurse who lives alone, never married and never had children. She rents a charming little cottage behind her house to tenants. She is the perfect land-lady. Always there with a great meal, a smile and an ear ~~ her patients adore her. The only problem Terry has is dealing with the memory of her dead mother, who had never loved Terry. Then Allison moved in after her previous tenant left ~~ leaving behind unpaid rent and a mess in the cottage. Allison is this gorgeous 28-year-old with a sense of love and life. She drags Terry out to live up life ~~ becoming the best friend Terry has always wanted. Till lies and whispers dodge Allison's trail everywhere she goes. <br />This is an incredibly suspenseful book ~~ but like I said, it's not Fielding's best book. It's a great book to read while snuggling under a blanket on a cold fall night ~~ but don't expect it to be stellar like Grand Avenue. <br />9-22-03	2003-09-22

There have been a series of murders lately ~~ and it all points to the ruling class in Mexico ~~ as they fought to keep the political powers in their grasp. Stories and rumors fly about in Washington and Mac Smith is right in the middle of it. His wife joins him on the trip to Mexico and they're in the midst of all the excitement.<br />It is a fast read ~~ an interesting one. But if you're looking for a book with some substance to it ~~ this book would not be it. It is just a fast mystery read that you don't have to think about the characters much.

Then Ave Maria finds out that the man who she thought is her father isn't ~~ and she begins a search for her true identity. Then all of a sudden, after years of no interest from the male population, she gets two proposals and life begins to change for Ave Maria. <br />It is a funny and witty insight into small town life ~~ the characters are loveable and everyone is like everyone else that the reader knows. You can't but help fall in love with the Stone Gap residents and you find yourself cheering for them.

Margaret Atwood has a talent for words ~~ and this book is one of the few books written in the English language that makes you want to read more on science and look up the meanings of the words. It is also a morbid look into the darker side of human nature and relationships between little girls and their so-called friends/tormentors. Atwood used an autiobiographical vein throughout this book ~~ drawing you into the life of Elaine, the main character who has never quite feel in place while young. Uprooted by her parents always on the search for her father's science projects, Elaine longed nothing more than to have a best friend. And when she finally has a best friend, her life changes but not necessarily for the better.<br />This is an indepth look at relationships little girls endure while growing up. It is also an indepth into Elaine's mind as she grows up to be a successful painter. Behind that facade of success is a lonely and terrified woman though she hides it well ~~ with a sneer and sharp comebacks to anything anyone says. Throughout the book, she relives her memories of a childhood that is not so special as she had wished for. It shaped her to be this woman that she is ~~ and stripped her dreams to reality.<br />It is an interesting look into women's psyche ~~ I have to admit that it took me awhile to get into the story because it was so dark and more morbid than I recall Atwood ever writing. But she has a flair for drawing readers into her stories. This is definitely one story that I won't forget so easily. It is a genuine Atwood at one of her best.<br />9-15-03	2003-09-16

There is Casey who has a secret regarding the little girl she brought home from Chicago. There is Peggy, who was supposed to be in her last semester of college but decided to stay home instead. And this is their stories. <br />Once again Richards prove that she is an excellent story-teller. This is one fast read ~~ one that will keep me hopping till I read the sequel. She has a talent of making her characters seem as real as you and I. And the relationships between the sisters are like mine. It's a fun and captivating read ~~ especially since it has a dollop of history thrown in it. I am a native Ohioan and now my curiousity has been piqued about Cleveland's history. Only a good author can do that.<br />9-9-03	2003-09-10
986427:US	49865122	R3RB803SCULSHE	0142004235	974134151	East of Eden, John Steinbeck Centennial Edition	Books	5	4	5	N	N	This book would make Shakespeare proud!	I just finished this novel. And I am totally speechless and in awe of Steinbeck's writing. I am also wondering why I have never read it before! This book would make Shakespeare proud! As most English Lit majors in college would know ~~ that Shakespeare is the world's most acclaimed playwright ~~ he writes about every emotion under the sun known to man and he makes the audience see and feel the stories that is very familiar to mankind. Steinbeck's East of Eden should be regarded in the same category. This may be a drama, but it is a reflection on humankind ~~ men who seeks to find the gold in their dreams and experience everything that is known to mankind. These men, Charles Trask, Adam Trask, Cal Trask, Aron Trask, Samuel Hamilton, Lee have sought happiness at their whim and some succeeded and others didn't. They reacted to whatever life throws their way ~~ either with strength and courage or with cowardice. No man is alike in this book and yet they are. Even the women handled things differently in this book. There is Cathy/Kate, the eternal whore and there is Abra Bacon, the eternal mother-figure. <br />Please don't be discouraged by the long descriptive pages that Steinbeck employed to introduce his characters. They only serve to enrich the novel and make these people come alive between these pages and in your imagination. This is a classic book and it flows easily between the pages. It is also one of the most lyrical writing I have yet to read. Steinbeck's talent is that he makes people come alive and tell their stories of their struggles with guilt, sin and love. It is a book that will touch you immensely and you will not forget these people.<br />It's a definite must-read for any serious reader.<br />9-5-03	2003-09-05

And this is one of them. Once again, she proves to be an author that I really would love to read more of. I don't have an idea why she's labeled in the romance section of the bookstore ~~ she hardly touches on the romance of relationships, she writes more about strong women and their journies in life. This book is just as good as Prospect Street if not better. <br />Julia finds herself blind after a horseback riding accident ~~ though all the specialists said that there were no physical cause for it. She returns home to Ashbourne with her daughter, intending to make her separation from her husband temporary. With the love and support of her mother, Julia begins to find her way back to life again. Her former lover is released from jail after evidence shows that he did not murder Julia's best friend ~~ and chaos erupted. Julia finds herself on the road to recovery ~~ but had to endure a lot of secrets that had lied dormant for too long.<br />Also, in this story is a novel that Maisy, Julia's mother, had written ~~ so this makes this book unique ~~ a novel within a novel. I was entranced from the first page to the last ~~ and I loved every moment of it. It's a mystery novel too ~~ and keeps you on your toes throughout the book. <br />I wish I had discovered Richards sooner ~~ her books are hard to find in the local bookstores ~~ and/or out of print ~~ because I am really enjoying the depth she brings to each woman in her stories. She makes them come alive and real ~~ like you and me. If you like an intriguing story that is full of descriptions and mystery ~~ this book is for you. It's a wonderful addition to anyone's library!<br />8-25-03	2003-08-26

You know it's a good book when you are hunched over the book in the hospital waiting room and you find yourself holding your breath as you turn the pages while following Robert's chase in the Vatican City. In spite of all the monitors, people calling on the intercoms, and all the normal noises that comes with the hospitals, you are so engrossed in this book ~~ you just have to finish it before your curiousity ate you up. This is literally one book that you cannot put down. <br />Dan Brown has shown his talents for suspense long before he wrote The Da Vinci Code ~~ this book is one. If you are a conspiracy bluff, this book is one that you should read. If you like to be engrossed with a novel, letting nothing interrupt you, this book is it. This is my second best mystery this summer (the first, obviously being The Da Vinci Code!) and I am definitely passing this one around!<br />Robert Langdon is awakened in middle of the night by a strange phone call. Just a historian and professor at Harvard, he didn't think he could help with this murder of a prominent scientist. But once he got to Geneva, he was entangled in a mystery that got more interesting and intriguing by the moment. Joined by Vittoria, the scientist's daughter, they were in a race of time to save the Vatican City from an explosion. Along the way, Robert had to figure out the clues left in the city by artists centuries earlier in search of the Illuminatis that claims to be behind this latest fiasco. <br />This book is enriched by details ~~ you find yourself looking up the art on the websites so you can visualize the clues that the Illuminatis left years ago. You find yourself holding your breath as every twist and turns have been taken in this journey. The last page is turned before you want it to ~~ you love the suspense and intrigue. It is just a fascinating and fun read. I cannot wait to read more of Dan Brown's work. He is the latest talent today and a really good find! I can't wait to read more of hisbooks!<br />8-23-03	2003-08-23

I happened to stumble across it at a garage sale and picked it up. It is definitely a find ~~ now, I have found another author to add to my favorites list. Emilie Richards is an author to keep an eye out for. <br />This book is a gem. It starts out with Faith, the perfect daughter of an US senator and his wife, perfect wife of an upcoming and rising politican and mother of two, Remy and Alex. One day, her world crumbles when she discovers her husband is having an affair ~~ and found her world is built upon shams and deep secrets. For starters, her parents survived the kidnapping of her older sister, Hope. And secondly, she has to rebuilt the Georgetown home that is her mother's ~~ and while there, she starts to explore what the past holds. Along the way, she meets Dottie Lee, her next door neighbor who seems to know all the secrets of everyone who have lived in Georgetown, and she meets Pavel Quinn, a man with a secret of his own. <br />This is a really insightful novel ~~ not only is Faith dealing with the issues of her failed marriage, she is dealing with her parents' secrets, Remy's attitude change from being the perfect daughter to the teenager from hell, and Alex's blooming into a delightful young man who discovers his own talents. Also, Faith has to work with her images as being the perfect daughter/wife/mother ~~ and accepts herself in the end. <br />It is just a really interesting book ~~ full of twists and turns that keeps you guessing. And it does tug at your heartstrings ~~ Richards writes with feeling. She is definitely one author I'd like to read more of!<br />8-15-03	2003-08-15

She knew that it was because she was caught shop-lifting for the fourth time when they moved ~~ it was just her and her mother. This is Eva's story and friendship with a reclusive beekeeper who lives down the road. This is also a story about Miriam, her mother, and a story about her father, Francis. Miriam fears for Eva's future and was secretive about the real reason why Eva's father died. <br />For awhile there, both characters have lost one another ~~ drifted apart through the years. Then they reunite in this country town ~~ after Eva suffers an accident. Burl, the beekeeper, is also a part of the story too ~~ it was through his bees that mother and daughter find their way back to one another.<br />This is a lyrical book. Very well-written and engrossing. It is also a haunting book ~~ I find myself thinking of all of the characters and how much they represent us all. I have never read any of Graver's books, but I really enjoy this one and want to read more of her books. She's another author to add to my list!	2003-08-12

This book isn't one of her best books ~~ normally, I can't put down her books and do something else. I was able to put it down several times and leave it be for a week before picking it back up. This book just wasn't as suspenseful and interesting as others were. <br />It's about Jess, a lawyer struggling to reconcile her past with her present. She is a prosecutor faced with several trials happening. First her client goes missing just before she is due to testify in court against her rapist. Her ex-husband defends the accused rapist and re-enters her life. Jess doesn't get along with her sister's husband ~~ and is sharply critical of her family. She meets a shoe-salesman and begins to wonder why he's in her life just when things start to fall apart. Her mother has disappeared 8 years ago ~~ and the memories of the last time she ever saw her mother begins to interfere with her life. No wonder she's a mess. <br />This is a story ~~ just not one of Fielding's best. It's not as well-written or well-thought out. It didn't tug at your heartstrings ~~ but it is entertaining. It's not the best buy of the summer but it is a good one. If you're a Fielding fan, you might enjoy it ~~ but don't expect it to be like Grand Avenue.<br />8-6-03	2003-08-06

It is a classic, never-ending tale of a bunny fighting to go to bed at night. So he tries to prolong the inevitable by naming everything in his room and saying good night to it. It's a cute book ~~ very simple for beginners to try and perhaps to introduce a young reader to the joys of reading. <br />I enjoy reading it to my sons ~~ it's a classic.<br />7-31-03	2003-08-01

I have never heard of Artemisia before and now that I have read this book, I am very intrigued by this historical woman artist! This book will captivate you from the first page to the last. It is a keeper as well!<br />Artemisia stands on trial in Rome after she accuses a man of raping her. It turns out that it was her reputation and life that was ruined ~~ so her father, instead of defending her, married her off to a painter from Florence and sent her home with him. And that is just the beginning of the story.<br />With flair and careful descriptions, Vreeland writes of a woman struggling to find her calling as an artist, wife, daughter and mother. Throughout Artemisia's life, she is always struggling internally with her father's betrayal and it shows in her painting and relationship with her daughter. It shows in her relationships with men and other people, as well as with her father. <br />The descriptions Vreeland crafted in this book draws you in ~~ you can't help but look at colors differently now. She does a wonderful job of painting a world of words for the reader ~~ and gives the reader a new appreciation of life and art and love. This is a book that no one should ever ignore ~~ it speaks so vividly to the spirit. And you can relate so well with Artemisia ~~ she is everywoman struggling against the mores of society, trying to carve her own niche in life.<br />This is a keeper.<br />7-31-03	2003-08-01

Finally, I can see what everyone raves about whenever they talk about this author. <br />I was very disappointed. This book is way too brutal and graphic for my taste ~~ it is nothing but raw sex and violence and graphic murder scenes. I kept reading to see what would happen and never did finish this book. It is one of the very few books I have never finished reading. I was really disgusted ~~ and gave it back to my friend without too much comment. <br />I have no desire now to read any of her books ~~ which is sad because I am always up for new authors to discover. This book was a waste of time. Sorry.<br />7-30-03	2003-07-30

Since there are over 3,000 reviews on this book, I'll keep mine real short. I have read all of Rawlings' books and this one is just as good as the others. However, this book starts off on a darker tone than the others did ~~ Harry Potter is now 15 and is moody as most teenage boys that age are. But he still retains his sweetness and intergrity amidst all of the confusion that is happening at the Ministry of Magic and at Hogswart.<br />This is an excellent follow-up to the other four books in the series ~~ and as usual, leaves you hungering for more of Harry Potter. I highly recommend this book to all adults and children ~~ there is nothing like a classic entertaining book about good vs. evil. This book is it...	2003-07-28

When they get a little older, I plan to emphasize the numbers in that book ~~ like counting 10 sheep climbing over the fence while these two little dragons get ready to take their naps.<br />This is about two little dragons sent upstairs by their moms to take a nap. Instead of going to sleep, they tried to find ways to stay awake ~~ like painting word pictures, counting sheep and other things. It is a nap-time book ~~ perfect for my little boys who also don't like to take naps. It's a great book ~~ full of bright and colorful pictures. Even if your youngster is too young to read it ~~ she/he will be entertained by the pictures. Mine were.<br />7-27-03	2003-07-28

If I am going to be the main story-teller in the family, I am going to read the books I thoroughly enjoy as I am sure I'll be re-reading them over and over. This is one book that will be on that list of books I'll enjoy throughout time. <br />A little bunny tells his mommy that he's going to run away ~~ and his mommy always has a ready answer to his queries. It is a strong book about a mother's love for her child ~~ that no matter where he goes in the world, she is going to keep coming after him because she loves him. <br />My boys love the colors of this book and the artistic design ~~ they love the story even though they are only a year old right now. I love reading the story to them ~~ it's another way of telling them that my love for them won't die. I know that sounds really sappy ~~ but it's true!

I read it for the first time to my twin sons tonight and was amazed at the colorful pictures, the storyline and the way the author counted time for the young readers. It is a moral book ~~ that teaches kids to be more grateful and to say please and thank yous. It also points out other people's kindnesses as well as their flaws. <br />It's about a braggart lady bug, who was told to go off and bully someone else. There is a series of characters that the lady bug meets and turns out to be bigger than she is. It's colorful, certain to grab the child's attention and gives a nice moral to the story as well. It's not boring for the parent to read ~~ I am sure I'll be reading this one constantly over the next five years. It also gives the child perspective on nature ~~ like the beetle's claws, the yellow jacket's stinger and lobster's claws. Those are just among the few descriptions the author has thrown in there!<br />Enjoy this book ~~ it's a keeper!<br />7-25-03	2003-07-26

I have read all of Flagg's books and this one is just as sweet and humorous as her others. If you love Southern Fiction, then you will love this book. It is unbeatable! It is a page-turner ~~ you can't help but turn the page in order to keep up with the residents of Elmwood Springs. <br />Dorothy broadcasts her radio show from her living room along with her mother-in-law ~~ bringing local news and gossip to the town and surrounding areas. She brings such warmth and humor into the book that you wish she was your own mother! Or neighbor! Then there is Minnie Oatman, head of a gospel-singing family, her daughter Betty Raye who desires nothing more than to put her roots down somewhere and not travel, there is Bobby, Dorothy's rascally son who is so curious and full of imagination that lives a thousand lives, there is Jimmy, their boarder who is a WWII vet who lost his leg in battle, there is Tot Whooten, Dorothy's neighbor who seems to have a string of bad luck starting with her husband. Then there is Anna Lee, Dorothy's beautiful daughter who is always squabbling with Bobby. There is Hamm Sparks, a man full of ambition, Doc Smith, Dorothy's husband and the town pharamicist. <br />These are just a few of the characters in the book ~~ but you'll warm up to the story telling that spans four decades. You'll laugh with them, cry with them, moan over them and sometimes fight their fights as well. They are people just as real as your neighbors, friends and family are. Flagg writes about the everyday people through the changes of time. It is a very heart-warming book ~~ one that you keep thinking of long after the last page has been turned. <br />I highly recommend this book ~~ not just for its humor but for the indepths Flagg writes about her characters. You know those characters because they are you. This book will haunt you sweetly and make you long for your childhood days again ~~ as well as for the times you've wished you were with your friends and family again.

I have never been able to read Lisa Gardner's books without putting it down ~~ and this book is no exception!<br />The book centers around a state detective hot on the trail of a double murder. Griffin had just returned to work after a bereavement leave ~~ he had just lost his wife to cancer ~~ only on the day he arrives to work, an accused serial rapist, who was on his way to court for the first day of trial, was shot to death by a sniper. Then a few blocks away, the sniper was blown up as he entered his car. The suspicions soon focused on the three \\"survivors\\" ~~ three women who were raped by the accused serial rapist, Eddie. And that was just the first chapter. <br />This book will be hard to put down ~~ Gardner strings you along with tempting bits every chapter ~~ and no matter what you do, you can't resist it. She delves into the psychological aspects of the rape victims as well into Griffin's mindset as he tracks down the mystery of the rapists and murders. You find yourself relating to the darker sides of the story and you really shouldn't read this alone at night ~~ it will spook you!

This is one of her selections and it's one of the few that I had a hard time getting into. For one thing, it is very dark and depressing. I wish someone had warned me of that when I bought this book. It is also extremely violent ~~ which I have a hard time grasping. There is enough violence in this world, I know, but this book just rubbed me raw. <br />Harley, the main character of this book, is a young man stuck with the responsibilty of raising his younger sisters since his mom went to jail for murdering his dad. This book is mostly flashbacks of Harley's life and the present-day. Struggling to keep food on the table and the roof over his head, Harley shows a lot of resentment for such a heavy responsibilty. He refuses to visit his mom in jail. He tends to defend his father who is abusive. He resents his sisters for being young and not working. He fights to keep his sisters together even when they ignore what he wants. He also falls in love with a beautiful housewife who appears to have it all. Then it all explodes into a mass confusion and stark truth. It leaves Harley (and the reader) reeling with shock and confusion.<br />This is an interesting book ~~ but too dark and violent for my personal taste. I usually buy books to escape into ~~ not to escape from! O'Dell definitely showed the darker side of human nature in this book ~~ and dysfunctional family takes on a new whole meaning as well. If you are into dark reading, this book is perfect for you. It's well-written with doses of black humor and despair. If it's a lighter read you are looking for, don't get this one.<br />7-7-03	2003-07-08

My dad recommended Shogun to me when I was in high school ~~ but the sheer volume of this book put me off. I happened to stumble across it in a book sale and decided to try it. It happily accounted for all of my spare time for two weeks (which I didn't have much of!). <br />This is an extremely fascinating read ~~ I am real glad I picked it up. However, I must warn you, half way through the book, the author seems to have hit a dry spell ~~ it was very dry and hard for me to get through it. In my opinion, it should have been edited out because it was not that relevant to the story. It does pick up again ~~ and it really keeps you thinking of Feudal Japan for a long time after. <br />This story is about Blackthorne, a bold Englisher who stumbled across Japan in a storm, Mariko, a lovely Christian Samurai woman, who falls in love with Blackthorne, and Lord Toranaga, who is one of the regents ruling on the behalf of the Heir. This is their story ~~ a true soap opera of life in the times of Feudal Japan. This is a fun read ~~ it has it all. Samauri fighting for their lords, mystery, intrigue, plots, sex, romance, whirlwind battles and so forth ~~ I am glad I had a chance to read this book. It would have been a five if it weren't for that long stretch of irrelevant waiting period ~~ where time seemed to have stood still for over 200 pages! Other than that, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone! If you're a history buff, this book is definitely for you!<br />7-7-03	2003-07-08

I couldn't put it down at all ~~ and I was in the midst of the move as well! A friend recommended this book to me since I loved A Girl With A Pearl Earring and this book is just as well-written. If you like historical fiction ~~ this book will grab your attention!<br />Sophia, a bored housewife, meets and falls in love with portrait painter, Jan van Loos who also falls in love for the first time with one of his clients. And this story is about their affair and how they plotted to run away from Amsterdam so they can be together. At the heart of this dream is a Semper Augustus bulb ~~ a tulip bulb that would bring in thousands of dollars at the right time ~~ and this book is full of tales of the lovers, her husband, her maid and errant lover. From the first page to the last ~~ it is entertaining with a wicked sense of charm as well.<br />I wouldn't hesitate to read this book ~~ it does sound kind of dull but don't judge the book by it's book cover ~~ it is really one of the best reads I've read this year. It's perfect for summer reading as well ~~ so grab a copy and take it on vacation!<br />7-7-03	2003-07-08

I love Julie Garwood's books ~~ always have and this one is no exeception to the rule. I have to admit that I am glad she is also writing suspense novels ~~ I am addicted to that genre and it's a thrill to have one of my favorite authors writing in that area of reading as well!<br />Killjoy is a suspenseful book about Avery, a FBI employee, who was supposed to have met up with her aunt in Aspen, Colorado for a couple weeks of relaxation time at a spa. Only her aunt never showed up there. Avery then joins John Paul, an ex-Marine who was searching for the hired assassin, Monk Edwards, to find her aunt and rescue her before she dies. The plot thickens and twists and turns ~~ and the person behind the plot is so sinister that even my breath is taken away. And I have read a lot of suspense books. <br />Garwood is a talented writer that knows how to hook her readers into her imagination ~~ and keeps them entertained and enthralled till the last page is turned. This book is no different. It is more violent than Mercy or Heartbreaker ~~ but still, I enjoy her writing and how she manages to keep the reader guessing the truth till the very end. This book is such a nice pace from the gloomy spring Ohio has been enduring ~~ it's a perfect book to while away a gloomy afternoon. <br />5-25-03	2003-05-26

I found it among my Grandmother's books when I was in high school and have read it every year ever since. This is a true historical fiction and it is what got me interested in reading historical fiction as well.<br />This is about Rachel and her ancestors. They are Jewish women who have faced persecution throughout the centuries just because they were Jewish. And beginning with the first Rachel, there was a diamond that is symbolic of their heritage ~~ which is fitting for the women. A diamond is beautiful but also the toughest gem in the world. Only another diamond can scratch the diamond ~~ and none of these Rachels allowed life to defeat her.<br />This is an inspiring book. It is one of the very first books I have ever read that allows the heroine to be the strong one ~~ and it is inspiring in my personal life. I highly recommend reading this book ~~ for anyone who is interested in history and in reading about strong women. <br />5-23-03	2003-05-24

It's a guaranteed read to take your mind off of your troubles! This is my first Sabine Durrant book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't read it to pick at the moral issues ~~ I read it to have a break from nonstop packing and moving woes. And it's a perfect escape!<br />Maggie gave up her career to stay home to raise her two little boys ~~ her boys with her partner, Jake. One day she runs into her schoolhood chum and realized that her own life isn't as together as Claire's. Then to top it off, she suspects Jake is having an affair with Claire ~~ and off this book goes. With hilarious tales of two little boys running amuck in the house and with other people, Maggie begins a journey into self-awareness. And this is a fun hilarious read!<br />At first Maggie puts herself down for being a stay-at-home mom ~~ engrossed with recipes and childcare and local gossip. Then as the story progresses, she begins to realize that she is the envy of the women in her life. And she begins to grow up!<br />This is a must-read for all women ~~ regardless of their marital status or children-status. I think moms with very young children can relate to Maggie's dilemmas with the babies ~~ but everyone can enjoy the stories. Durrant writes with a flair and humor ~~ you can't help but fall in love with the characters and keep on turning the pages. This is the perfect summer read!<br />5-22-03	2003-05-23

It sounds so depressing ~~ a couple loses their twin daughters to a flash flood and two years later, they end up being foster parents of an African-American boy. Then shortly after they become foster parents, the couple go through tumultous times in their marriage due to the husband's infidelity. It doesn't sound like an uplifting book at all. And I wasn't quite sure where the Buffalo Soldier came in. <br />After reading a few pages ~~ I was hooked. Laura and Terry, the couple becomes as real to me as the neighbors. Alfred, the foster son, who the story is centered around becomes the kid everyone would love to have. Even Phoebe, Terry's girlfriend, has a voice and she is just as real as the other characters in the book. And throughout the book is little intercepts of letters from The Buffalo Soldier, who did exist during the Wild West days. The Buffalo Soldiers were given their names from the Native Americans, who admired them. They were African-Americans sent to capture/kill the natives while protecting the settlers out west. Alfred reads the book that the neighbor professor had given him and he models himself after one of the soldiers. This soldier is a man of virtue ~~ a role model. <br />This book is full of feelings and emotions ~~ it is a book I did not regret picking up. It is a book about life and death, survival and love, gentleness and hatred, fear and sorrow. It's a complex book ~~ one that takes some time to let sink in and it's just as good as The Midwives, which is his first book. It's about healing and letting go and forgiveness. It is an inspiring book ~~ a book of stout character. One that I will not soon forget!<br />5-18-03	2003-05-19

However, after reading this memoir, I am tempted to read more of her books since she is such an interesting writer. Her life is just as interesting as some of the books I have read! <br />Clark comes across as a woman of vital strength and character ~~ which is what you don't normally hear about these days. Her growing up years were tough but very interesting. Her recollections are also inspiring. And she also throws in a dash of humor every now and then. She is also a blunt writer ~~ honest about everything including herself. <br />If you like memoirs, this book is an excellent choice to pick up! It gives an insight into America's favorite author and her lives. Instead of being a diva, Mary Higgins Clark is one of us.<br />5-18-03	2003-05-19

This book is definitely a fast-paced thriller ~~ you can't put it down. <br />With events beginning with a bombing in a Georgetown restaurant, Kirk Macgrevor begins the hunt for the killers and finds a conspiracy between the Japanese and unidentified sources in the White House ~~ and with the countdown of a space ship in Japan looming, Macgrevor races against time to find the killers. He writes to keep you on your toes ~~ and I thoroughly enjoyed it even though the book has left me with more questions than answers ~~ as if the last few chapters were written in a haste and no answers to be found. That is why I rate this book a 3 star ~~ something was missing. <br />Other than that, it is an enjoyable read. It's a great summer read ~~ it's a thriller unlike others.<br />5-13-03	2003-05-14

However, as I continue to read this book, I find it very intriguing and very interesting. It's definitely a book geared to mothers and daughters ~~ and Florey describes the intricate interweaving of relationships between mothers, daughters, sisters and lovers with a flair that most authors don't seem to have these days. <br />This book is also written in an unique way. Florey starts with the present ~~ Margaret, the fifth generation, then it travels back into time. Florey takes a chapter for each woman and brings these women alive with feelings, dreams and broken dreams, unfulfilled desires and sadness, and on and on. It's wonderfully written and I loved it. I, personally, can relate to every character in the book ~~ and Florey has done a wonderful job of bringing them to life. These are women who are flesh and blood like the rest of us. <br />I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this book ~~ fortunately, my mother picked it up and loaned it to me to read. I can't wait to give it back to her and urge her to read it next! Like mother, like daughter. =) This is a book you should read and pass onto all the mothers and sisters and daughters in your life. <br />5-8-03	2003-05-09

I am a fan of Jennifer Crusie's books ~~ she is definitely an entertaining writer and this book is no exception! I was able to kick back and watch the sparks fly between Tilda, the main character and Davy, her romantic interest, fly like crazy. Both are con artists ~~ Tilda forges art for a living ~~ keeping up the Goodnight tradition and Davy's a con artist ~~ and they kept the pace up throughout the whole book. <br />They met up in Clea's closet ~~ Davy's there to recover the money she had stolen from him and Tilda's there to recover one of her Scarlet paintings and the book takes off from there. There is Nadine, the granddaughter, who is trying to figure out what her career interest is. There is Gwennie, the matriach of the family who longs to escape the art gallery and soak up the sun at a distant beach, drinking fruity alcoholic drinks. There is Eve who has a distinct second personality ~~ Louise, who performs at her ex-husband's club four nights a week. There is Clea, the amoral beauty queen whose husbands have died under mysterious circumstances and left her broke. On her third victim, she tries to snare him. Mason, the third husband-to-be, is also chasing after Gwennie ~~ and on and on. This book is a wonderful read ~~ light and funny and entertaining! I wouldn't have missed this book for the world!<br />Crusie is a fun writer that knows how to keep the reader's attention. This book is a sure bet!<br />5-2-03	2003-05-02

This book had me hooked from page one to the last page ~~ it's witty, quick and brash and at the same time, it is bittersweet. It's a wonderful Southern lit book ~~ and it's one of my favorites. This is the first time I have ever heard of Mary Kay Andrews and I am hooked. <br />Weezie Foley lands in the midst of a murder-scandal accidentally while looking for a bathroom at an estate sale ~~ and how she gets out of it is a hilarious tale in itself. Then revelations about family members, ex-husband, new boyfriend and friends spice up the entire book with their tales ~~ this book keeps you on its toes and never lets up till the last page is turned!<br />If you like mystery with a good dash of romance ~~ this book is for you. Not only is it fun ~~ it is hilarious in some places ~~ these Southerners have a great sarcasm and it shows. Nothing seems to stop them except extreme humidity ~~ and an icy gin and tonic can cure that. So grab that bottle of suntan lotion and head for the lake or the nearest shade and enjoy!

It was very interesting and I had a hard time putting it down at times. And I love how it was two stories (or two cases) in the book ~~ two chases for Coltrane to live through!<br />Coltrane, a photographer, is caught photographing mass burial grounds in Bosnia and endured through one hell of which he survived. Then as he thought he was free to enjoy life again ~~ he runs into a reknown photographer who commissioned him to take pictures like his first famous series. Then Packard died ~~ leaving behind a mystery about the most beautiful face in his collection. Coltrane ends up trying to solve that mystery only to find himself in danger. It was a fairly quick read ~~ full of twists and turns! Just when you thought you solved the dilemma ~~ you were taken for a surprise and compelled to read more. <br />If you are into mysteries, this book is a great one! It's great for those beach reads too ~~ not too dark on the mind or spirits either ~~ but not that slow ~~ so pick it up and enjoy!<br />4-25-03	2003-04-26

A friend recommended this book to me and I thought I'd read it over Easter weekend. It is a well-written book but it was also slightly disappointing because it wasn't as well thought-out as I had hoped. This book was barely about Peter the disciple ~~ it was more on the feud between Israel and Arabia. Fara's mother was married to Antipas, one of the leaders of Galilee only he treated her poorly. She comes home to raise their daughter, Fara, and when she died, Fara promised revenge on her father. She travels to Galilee ~~ and meets John the Baptist and Jesus and Peter ~~ and her life changed. However, Voldi, the man she loves, came to find her and to extact the revenge. <br />Only very little did it talked about Peter and the disciples ~~ and I was rather disappointed since I was hoping for more insights in the religious men that started a new religion that has transformed the world. It was a very fascinating book ~~ don't get me wrong, just not what I expected it to be. <br />If you are looking for a good read with a historical theme ~~ this book is it. If you are looking for a book that has more of a biological overtone to it ~~ this book is not it. It is a good read ~~ and will leave you satisfied.<br />4-25-03	2003-04-26

If I had a daughter, I would give it to her to read. These women are the unsung heroes of time and history. From frontier days to modern civilization, women have always been the backbone of any social change. Women have fought for equal pay, equal rights and better working conditions. Women have fought for the right to vote. They fight to better society. They fight to keep the family farms. They raised children and worked in factories to keep food on the table. They may have been subjected to men and laws ~~ but they have always fought to have a better life.<br />This book is very inspiring. Buckeye women are strong and intelligent women who didn't let prejudice stop them from achieving their goals. They fought for what they believed in. And some of the Buckeye women have moved onto the national platform ~~ bringing Ohio into the forefront of history. It's a fascinating read ~~ very insightful and for those who don't care for long descriptives, this book is brief and straight to the point. I didn't feel like they've left anything out ~~ in fact, this book has piqued my interest in Ohioans and read more on Ohio history. It's a fascinating look into time. It also makes me very thankful that my foremothers fought to give me better opportunities in life ~~ it's a book that everyone should read.<br />4-17-03	2003-04-17

I had a blast reading this book ~~ it was fun, fast-moving and chock full of interesting information about a conspiracy and theories about Christ and his followers ~~ that I couldn't stop turning the pages. Dan Brown knows how to write to captivate an audience ~~ and I have to say that you shouldn't walk to the nearest bookstore ~~ you should run and buy this copy! Don't wait for the paperback to come out ~~ this is such a fun book that it's worth every penny in buying this book!<br />Robert Langdon, a professor from Harvard, gets a middle-of-the-night rousing from the French Police while speaking in Paris. The curator of the world's most reknown museum has been found dead in the museum ~~ and Robert, who was to meet this man, is one of the top suspects in this man's murder. And thus begins this book. With the curator's granddaughter Sophia, Robert begins a run for his life while solving the mystery from the dead man's last message in finding the answer to where the Holy Grail is.<br />Some parts of this book is predictable ~~ it was for me as I had guessed some of the answers early on ~~ but it's because I love reading books on conspiracies and religious themes ~~ not because he gave away the hints. But the historical studies and theories that are written throughout the book are very fascinating and some of the ideas are new concepts for me. It piques my interest enough to read more on them. With Robert and Sophia on the run for their lives and in solving the last riddle ~~ it does become tense in several places.<br />I wouldn't hesitate in picking up this book ~~ it's a definite thriller and must-read of the year. It's an intelligent book ~~ meaning that the author explains how they decipher codes and languages from the past ~~ and in such a fun way, you find yourself trying it out. Now I am hooked on Dan Brown's writings ~~ I plan to read more of his books.

However, I do read his books because he sure knows how to tell a story. This time, The Jester, really beat my expectations ~~ it is a fun story and who cares if the story is not historically accurate? It's fun and keeps you guessing throughout the whole book. It is a page-turner and you find yourself rooting for Hugh and the other serfs in this book ~~ you'd find yourself guessing the answers before it comes about ~~ and sometimes you're right, and sometimes Patterson gives you a surprise.<br />If you are looking for a more accurate historical fiction book ~~ then don't get this one. If you are looking for a good read with a good plot and suspense ~~ get it. Patterson may not be the best writer ~~ but he sure can tell a good story. Also, you can tell that it's Gross that wrote the book with Patterson telling the story because it's written neater and crisper than other Patterson books. I am a snob when it comes to my reading tastes, but this book sure is fun!<br />4-14-03	2003-04-14

It is very riveting and keeps me reading ~~ it's a sure read from page one to the last page. It is such a wonderful book ~~ sly, witty and yet there was a sense of release at the end of the book. Like the Old Mother, a pike that has lived in the river in this book for decades, this book grabbed me and wouldn't let go like a fishhook! <br />Framboise Simon returns to a small village on the banks of the Loire ~~ she wanted to fix up her old farmhouse that was her home during WWII and live out the rest of her days there. Only the secrets of her past returns to haunt her. Undaunted by blackmail though fearful ~~ Framboise had to make a decision on whether or not to reveal all. Only she knows the real story behind the Nazi SS execution of ten village men. Only she knows the secret behind her mother's sorrow. And that secret had permeated her whole life till there was nothing left of the youth she once was ~~ and this is the story. <br />Harris moves from past to present very smoothly ~~ garnering the reader's interest from one page to another ~~ and this is a guaranteed read, in my opinion. The foods she mention in this book is mouth-watering ~~ I had heck of a time not eating out my fridge throughout reading this book! The recipes, the slight poetry of Framboise's mother's writings, the secrets and the sorrow ~~ all kept me coming back for more like an addict.

It is very depressing and written in such an arid style that I find myself flipping to the back to see how much further I have left to read. Normally, I love reading books about families and their \\"issues\\" but this family is so normal that I find myself wondering what their issues were. I ended this book with a dejected feeling ~~ is that all to this book? I will read another Brookner book before I give up on her. <br />Sofka is the matritach of the family, with oldest irresponsible and shameless flirt, Frederick. Then there is Mimi, the perfect and docile daughter. Betty is the irrepressible youngest daughter who decides to run off to Paris to live flamboyantly. Then there is stern Alfred who was brought up to run the family's finances since Frederick couldn't be counted on to be responsible. And this book is about their lives ~~ how they attempt to leave behind their upbringing. Mimi and Alfred remain behind to devote themselves to their mother while Betty and Frederick took off for places unknown to do what they want to do. And in the end, they remain just as estranged from their family and mother just as they've always been. However, Sofka devotes her thoughts and energy to those two and labels them as her favorite. Even at the end ~~ she remained devoted to her eldest son and youngest daughter, though Mimi and Alfred spent their entire lives taking care of Sofka. <br />This book is a disturbing look into familial relations and of expectations that didn't measure up. It is an interesting book ~~ but written with such a dry style that I find myself often putting it aside. It is not the worst book I've ever read ~~ but it's not the best. It's great for English literature enthusiasts ~~ but not for others. <br />4-8-03	2003-04-09

I picked up Coastliners as it sounded so good and I wasn't disappointed. I must admit though that it was hard for me to get into the first few pages as it was so despondent in attitude and so gritty. But I stuck with it and ended up loving it. The writing just carries you away and you'll end up turning the pages just to get at the layer of secrets that seem to befall Madeline, the main character, everywhere she turns.<br />Madeline, nicknamed Mado, returns home from Paris. She had left the island ten years previous with her mother and left her father behind. The youngest daughter of GrosJean, a boat builder, she returns home to be with her father. Though she wasn't exactly welcomed, she stuck it out. There, she made friends with Roget, a man of secrets, and together they tried to save the island from washing into the sea. The story begins with a festival and ends with a festival in honor of the island saint. And in that year, so many revelations were revealed and Mado discovers herself in the process. She tries to rebuild her relationship with her father and other islanders. Always headstrong and bullish, Mado soon discovers that life will continue in spite of adversity. <br />Despite the gloomy atmosphere in the beginning of the book, Harris writes of joy and love in the midst of life's darkest times. She writes of hope and reconcilations. She writes of sibling rivalry that strikes a chord in the reader's heart ~~ she also writes of doomed romances and the ever-present sea washing upon the shores. It is an intriguing book ~~ one that speaks of adversity and determination. It has kept me turning the pages till the ending ~~ and it is well worth my time to read this book. Now that I've read a Joanne Harris book, I plan to read the others.<br />4-7-03	2003-04-07

Don't get me wrong, this is not a heavy tome ~~ not at all. It's a very personal book. It's an intimate book ~~ one that draws the reader into the minds of the characters as they relive certain events in their lives. And it makes you think and ponder about your life. <br />A chemical leak from a local psychopharmaceutical factory in Clarence spews out over the town. As a result, people starts to remember everything in their lives. This book, however, focuses on just a few characters, Madeline, a writer and mother who lives in a retirement home. Bennie, her son, is a professor at the local college ~~ ironically in the psychology studies ~~ is also a single dad to Sophie, his 9-year-old daughter. There is Susannah who moved to Clarence to join her finace, Todd, who is working on his studies at the local college too. The book revolves around these central characters and their lives and their memories. They all did serious soul-searching through remembering their past and present. <br />It is an interesting theory ~~ do you want to remember every single thing that has ever happened to you? Or do you prefer to forget some things? Are your memories 100% yours? Or was it fabricated throughout the years? The questions are endless and it does make you stop and wonder. <br />I really enjoyed this book in spite of its unusual writing style ~~ it did take me a few chapters to get into but once I got into the swing of the book, I was able to kick back and read it. However, it is not a fluffy book nor is it a happy book ~~ this book is somber and it does make you remember your past. You will find yourself relating to certain events in these characters' lives. Ursu has a way of drawing the reader into her world ~~ she brings back a lot of nostaglia and pride ~~ and if you're a Midwesterner like me, a lot of these memoriesare the same as yours as a kid. Each of the characters somehow manage to get connected to one another indirectly ~~ and leaves an impact on others' lives. <br />This is one of the most interesting reads I've read this year. It is a book I'd definitely pass onto others ~~ and Ursu is an author I'd be interested in reading more of.<br />4-2-03	2003-04-03

Much to my surprise, it's somewhat of a mystery book ~~ and I enjoyed it immensely! At least, I have a better idea of what Australia is like! <br />Lina is preoccupied with hiding her pregnancy from the villagers of Craggy Rock, a desert town in Australia. She hasn't even told her 10-year-old son yet ~~ and the next day, her whole life changes upon a chance meeting with an Englisher who was insistent that Lina is her best friend, who had disappeared ten years previous. Lina insists that she's Lina, wife to Tony and mother to Red ~~ is she hiding something more than she is willing to let on? And Barr writes convincingly of a woman with a past ~~ how the past catches up with her and the sleazy journalists who swarmed over the sleepy desert town just to get the hottest story of the year. <br />It is a quick read ~~ perfect beach read ~~ and it's not one of the fluffy chick lit either. Don't let the cover fool you. If there were sex scenes in that book, there weren't that many and it wasn't graphic either. The characters were more preoccupied with alcohol than sex ~~ which is an unusual change of pace for me! But it was an enjoyable read ~~ Barr is one author I would like to read more on...	2003-04-01

Yorke writes a beautiful haunting story of love and life and death ~~ longings and dreams and heartaches. Kate packs up her father and foster son to an isolated fishing village up in northern California ~~ or as she likes to say, she followed the fog. Wayne read an article in a newspaper about the fisherman's life and enraptured by the lonely life of fishing ~~ he told Kate he was moving up there. Kate agreed to take him and her father followed along.<br />They come to the village slowly eroded by the salt water and the fog ~~ it is always cold and wet there. People are depressed and very supersititious ~~ and there was the laurel tree that oozes sap and \\"foretells\\" a fisherman's death at the sea whenever it oozes. There is the local witch/mystic. The village is not pretty nor is it peopled by friendly people. Undaunted however, Kate, Wayne and Gerald decide to stay and make a go of it. However, as they become ingrained in the village's life and with the residents, they wonder if tragedy would be worth the loss of love.<br />This is a thought-provoking book. It tells of perils of life and love and hope after tragedy ~~ it is a book that will haunt you with its vivid descriptions of the sea and life by the sea. It will lull you into thinking life is grand then tragedy hits ~~ then you wonder how you'll survive. Kate deals with losing Wayne to adulthood ~~ and deals with the news of her son that was abducted 18 years before. She deals with how to live life again ~~ and inspires those around her to believe in love again. Even after death.<br />This is one of my favorite books this year. It was by chance that I picked this book up ~~ and I hope to read more of her works ~~ as she is a promising writer who captures dreams and write them down for us to read. And she's a beautiful, lyrical writer. It's a definite must-read!<br />3-30-03	2003-03-31

This book is the best read I've read so far this year ~~ and I hated to put it down.<br />There are five women in this bookclub ~~ Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons ~~ and later, a man joined the bookclub but his story doesn't come in till near the end of the book. The stories of each woman entwined with the others' and you feel you are peeping into their private thoughts as they go about the business of living. There is Slip, the protester. There is Faith with a secret that she keeps hidden so deep that not even her husband knows the real Faith. There is Audrey, preoccupied with sex and how that is affecting everything around her.

These are real women ~~ women that you might know ~~ and their stories. You'll read about how they overcome their problems in life ~~ oftentimes with humor, love and lots of good desserts. <br />Yes, the subject about women bonding together is old as time itself ~~ but Lorna creates five memorable characters ~~ and her creations are hilarious in some point of the novel and you feel as if you're growing up with them throughout the book. And you sense the real affection they have for one another. Their day-to-day lives are just as drab as ours are ~~ and just as exciting. She writes without abash about the mom crying that her children have flown the nest and how she thought it was just yesterday that she was feeding them in their high chairs. She writes about feuds between members of the group and how they amended their ways.

If you think this book is a serious tome on relationships between men and women and on love ~~ don't bother to pick this book up. If you are looking for a book that is pure escapism, fun, light, saucy and sexy ~~ this book is it! It is a very fun read ~~ I read it in two hours and had a great time reading it. Frankel's writing style is crisp and clear ~~ and very vivid. It is funny and I am being honest here, I couldn't stop turning the pages from the beginning to the end. It's been awhile since I can say that ~~ and I was fortunate enough to have an understanding husband who let me read this book uninterrupted while he took care of the babies.<br />Stacy is on a quest. She realized that in just one week, she will have been celibate for a year and not wanting to regain the \\"virgin\\" status she had worked so hard to get rid of sixteen years prior, she decided to find a man to break her celibate cycle. And this begins a riotous attempt to beat the end of the year. She works at an internet lingerie company, which was also having problems as well ~~ so in between meetings to save the company and setting off a new design line and meeting men ~~ Stacy's life quickly became a whirlwind. Preoccupied with sex, she bungles every attempt ~~ and it just gets more and more hectic towards the end of the book ~~ and more unpredictable.<br />Frankel didn't write the typical chick book ~~ where girl bemoans the lack of man, romance/sex in her life and obsessing over her weight and desires to have a family ~~ only to find that true happiness lies in herself all along. Nope. Frankel took a different twist on the single woman's life by allowing Stacy to be obsessed with sex and it was getting to the point where she didn't care ~~ and that's the fun part of this book. Frankel never leads the reader on to believe that this is a typical chick lit ~~ which is refreshing in itself for a change. Everything that can go wrong between a man and woman in that precoital haste ~~ happens in this book. <br />So, kick back and enjoy a few hours of escapism ~~ don't forget your diet coke or whatever you drink ~~ and just enjoy this book. Forget the real world for a few hours.<br />3-23-03	2003-03-23

I read Fortune's Rock and was thrilled to read that this book was based on Fortune's Rock too ~~ and with the same house as well! It felt like a trip down time reading this book ~~ only instead of the 1800s, it is now 1929-1930, where the Great Depression was starting, the unions being formed at the mills, people falling in and out of love ~~ people watching their fortunes soar then crash ~~ it was a time of unrest and change. It is a book on history as well as insights into human nature. <br />The book focuses on Honora and her husband Sexton. They bought this old convent shortly after they married ~~ and this house became the focal gathering point in the story. There is Vivian, the rich friend who was bored with her life and struck up a friendship with Honora. There is Louis, the union organizer who used the house for covert meetings to organize an union at the mills in the nearby town. There are Alphonse and McDermott ~~ a boy and a man who struck up a friendship that spanned the generation gap and McDermott became the boy's father figure ~~ for the first time in Alphonse's life, he is actually fed. And there are other characters that enliven this deeply entertaining book. <br />And throughout this book is Honora's reflections on life and the sea as she collects sea glass ~~ pieces of glass thrown into the sea and washed up on shore ~~ leaving no hints of the secrets they entail. <br />This is a lyrical book ~~ bouncing back and forth between characters ~~ and it's a beautiful book that explores dreams, loves and friendships between people. It is a book that makes you think and dream of times past and of the future ~~ it's a book you really can't put down! This is only the third book I've read of Shreve's collection ~~ and so far, this is my favorite.<br />3-21-03	2003-03-22

Maybe then I would have been more interested in the American Revolution and its leaders a lot sooner in my life. This book, well-written, just piqued my interest in George Washington and his wife, Martha &quot;Patsy&quot; Washington. I know nothing of the first couple ~~ and now, after reading Clark's book, I am intrigued. <br />This book is a very quick read. It skips around a bit but still flows into a rhythm that you can follow. It is part memory lane for George Washington as he reflects on his life as he leaves the presidency of the country he had helped shaped. It is part history ~~ Clark writes this book based on historical facts. But the history lover in me is not satisfied by the historical crumbs thrown my way ~~ the point is, Clark writes very movingly of George Washington and the affair of his heart. And this is an incredibly romantic novel ~~ one that gives a flattering image of George. <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in reading historical fiction ~~ if you want to try reading this genre, this book would be the one I'd start with. It's very interesting and tells you a bit about the historical time period and tells you about the love affair George Washington has with his wife. Now that Clark has piqued my interest in the American Revolution with this book ~~ I will be undoubtly grateful for her in writing this.<br />3-16-03	2003-03-17

Eliana is married to the owner of a vineyard in Florence, Italy, and is the mother of an ashmatic son. Left behind at the vineyard while her husband Maurizo travels 350 days out of the year ~~ Eliana never realizes that she is lonely till Ross Story, a mysterious American, rents one of the apartments in the villa. Drawn to one another through a love of art ~~ they quickly realizes that they are soulmates. And this is their story. <br />It is a quick read ~~ one to inspire sighs over the Tuscany landscape and art museum and the descriptions of food makes your mouth water. And the writing is artful ~~ leading you to the conclusion. If you're looking for a wonderful book to take to the beach this summer, this book is it. You can escape into the landscape and the romance ~~ and finish it in an afternoon. <br />3-16-03	2003-03-17

It makes me real glad that I am not Gracelin O'Malley ~~ having to see my family and friends starve to a slow death in the great famines of Ireland. I look at my rosy-cheeked chubby babies and thank the fate that I was born in this century. This book haunts you and will transport you back into time. A time of love and death, slavery and drudgery, of dreams and lost hope. And Gracelin O'Malley is a wonderful hero. <br />Ann Moore did an extensive research on this book ~~ looking through letters and journals to get the Irish voice from that era. She has written of despair and fear so well, that you can picture the characters vividly in Ireland. You can picture the huts and cottages, the men singing and the dancing ~~ the fear in the tenants' eyes once they realize they can't pay rent on thier land. When Gracelin's husband, the squire, beat her, you feel as if he was beating on all the Irish. You sense the deep hatred the Irish feel for the English. Ann Moore has revived a period of history that I know very little of. She has also sparked an interest to know more too.<br />If you're looking at a novel that speaks of love and honor, loyalty, dreams and despair, the fight between two countries, the courage to go on despite all the death and disease ~~ if you're looking for a heroine like Gracelin who did not let anything stop her from living life ~~ this book is it. You will not be disappointed. <br />Also, this is one of the most inspirational books you'll ever read. Don't fear, Moore didn't throw the biblical verses at you every time you turn a page ~~ no, she picked out verses that inspire Gracelin and her family to continue on despite the strife in their lives. You sense the strong faith in God throughout this book ~~ and the writing is very lyrical ~~ almost as gentle as the lilt in Irish voices.<br />This is one of the best books I've read in ages ~~ and it is definitely one that I will want tokeep.<br />3-11-03	2003-03-12

I have to admit at first I thought this book was rather slow in taking off ~~ but I kept reading ~~ something about Fenno keeps bringing me back. Once I wasn't in a hurry to finish this book, I ended up enjoying the lyrical flow of the wording in this book ~~ soft and gentle, very descriptive and insightful of the characters in the book.<br />The book starts out with Paul, Fenno's father, and his trip to Greece after his wife had died. Paul meets Fern, a lovely young American, and was rather intrigued by her hopefulness and dreams. The last part of the book is about Fenno and Fern ~~ how they met up on Long Island. In between pages, the story is riveted on Fenno and his chosen lifestyle in America and his reflections on his brothers and childhood in Scotland. There is a lot of skipping back to the past then back to the present in this book but Glass does a wonderful job of keeping you on track ~~ you don't feel like you've lost your balance in this book like you would in other books. In fact, it makes you long for a glass of good wine, and to settle back on the couch to enjoy a leisurely read.<br />This book is not to be rushed ~~ you must savor the stories Glass is telling you. All the stories are connected even if you don't make the connection right away. Fenno becomes a man to admire ~~ very human in all his faults as he struggles to find meaning in his life. Fern becomes a woman of courage once she faces the truth about herself. <br />It is just a neat novel. If you like to read about people, this book is it. Glass writes passionately of people and their lives ~~ as if she was an observer ~~ an intimate observer. It's not a make me feel good book ~~ but rather, life can be good, book. <br />3-6-03	2003-03-06

I have been a Binchy fan ever since my grandmother put a copy of &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; in my hands when I was a teenager. I was sad to hear that she retired. And was really excited to see that this book was available in the library when I went to get it. I've noticed that a lot of the reviews here are negative towards this book ~~ and I have to disagree. This is not Binchy's best book. But it's not her worst book either. <br />This book is mainly about Ella Brady and her friends. Ella Brady had everything come easy to her in her life till she fell in love with a married man. Then when her life started to spiral out of control, Brenda and Patrick, the co-managers of Quentins, took her under their wings. To get her mind off her problems and to make extra money, Ella agreed to help a college friend to make a documentary about the famed Dublin restaurant, Quentins. And yes, the story skips about. It's like a combination of short stories in the middle ~~ short stories about the restaurant patrons and their lives and how it changed because of something that happened at Quentins. It's a fascinating glimpse into ordinary lives ~~ just like our lives. These people have nothing in common other than their love for good food and good wine. And Ella and her friends wanted to capture the history of the restaurant and its people. <br />Binchy had said she was going to stick to writing short stories. She ended up combining short stories within a novel ~~ a neat approach to getting the reader interested. Maybe she didn't go into details about the characters, but she did make them seem real ~~ and you felt like you knew them. She did combine other characters from previous novels ~~ so it was like a homecoming of old friends mingling with new friends. It's a fun read. <br />Just because this book isn't like Binchy's previous novels doesn't mean that it's a horrible novel ~~ it's great. I loved it ~~ and was sad to have turned the last page. It was about ordinary people in ordinary times making the best of their lives ~~ so what's wrong with writing about that? Binchy writes best about people ~~ and this book is another example of that.<br />2-25-03	2003-02-26

Joy Fielding has a fan in me ~~ this must be the fourth book I've read of hers and I've yet to be disappointed in her writing! What a fun novel this is ~~ and it starts out with a bang and ends with a bang ~~ it's just a fun novel to read. Just prepare yourself for an afternoon of suspense. <br />Jane comes to and doesn't know who she is. All she knows is that she has blood on the front of her dress and she has thousands of dollars in her pockets but she doesn't know her name, nor does she know what she likes. She has no memory of who she is. And why she was standing alone on the busy streets of Boston. Amnesia. A scary psychological disorder ~~ and when she turned herself into the police, they sent her to the hospital and one of the psychologists on staff told her that something really stressful must have happened to her to block out who she is. <br />Jane's husband rescues her ~~ and Jane tenetatively explores her life again ~~ trying to figure out who she is and why she has lost her memory but she ends up being drugged. And the story keeps getting more suspenseful ~~ you know something is going to happen, but just not what. It's great! And Fielding keeps you enthralled as you turn every page. <br />If you are looking for a good read to sink into ~~ this book is it. Just be prepared not to have the ability to put the book down ~~ you won't be able to till the last page is turned. It's a great mystery and very suspenseful. Fielding has yet to disappoint me!<br />2-25-03	2003-02-26

This time, it's about Anna and her aunt, Rose, who she caught in her father's bed when she was 20. Thus began a history of Anna's flight from reality and truth ~~ and Rose. Rose needed Anna's help to get the family restaurant back into shape ~~ Anna needed a place to go after another failed love relationship ~~ and this is the basis of this novel.<br />I enjoy this novel ~~ but it's not Gaffney's best. The heart and soul of this book is about women's relationships and how it define them in the world ~~ it lacks passion and fire like her previous books. The characters themselves don't move the reader like it should ~~ and somehow I get the feeling the book is stilted in its writing. Maybe I am just disappointed that it's not a good of a read like the others ~~ where you dive into the book and sigh with nostaglia over mothers and daughters and friends. Maybe this is because I don't have an aunt that I am very close to ~~ it is an interesting perspective on an aunt/niece relationship ~~ something this nuclear society hasn't seen much of.<br />It is a good book ~~ quick and easy. If you're looking for a more in-depth reading ~~ this book isn't it. Don't expect this book to be like her previous books ~~ it's not. <br />2-25-03	2003-02-26

Some people aren't going to like this book ~~ simply because it seems like there is no real order to this book as it's broken up by characters instead of chapters. And you do have to use your imagination a little bit to get what Chevalier is trying to say. However, this book is really awesome in the way each character is thoroughly drawn-out and you end up feeling like you really know them. <br />The Colemans and the Waterhouses met at the cemetery on the day of Queen Victoria's death at the turn of the 20th century. Within moments you can gauge which family is sentimental (the Waterhouses with their falling angel over their plot) and which family is more modern (the Colemans with their big urn). Within moments, Livinia and Maude struck up a friendship that lasted several years and they also became friends with the gravedigger's son, Simon. This book is the story of their friendships and circumstances in their lives that brings the book to a conclusion. Meeting over a grave led to tragic happenings for both families ~~ almost as if death was lingering over their friendships. <br />This book is not narrated by just one character but by all the characters. Even the Coleman's cook have a little say in things happening in the household. It is a very interesting writing style ~~ probably my favorite style as I enjoy hearing what people have to say ~~ even if they are imaginary. <br />This book is different than from her first book ~~ Girl with a Pearl Earring ~~ so don't judge this book by the same writing style as the previous book. Chevalier explored a different writing techinque and it works for this book. It is a wonderfully-written book ~~ one that is a keeper in my personal library.<br />2-14-03	2003-02-15

When I asked the librarian if there were a lot of requests for this book, I was amazed to hear no. This book is definitely one of the few books I would re-read again. It's an epic ~~ a saga ~~ of star-crossed lovers and everyone in their lives. This is a book that you will find yourself savoring long after you've turned the last page and secretly, you will re-read passages again just so you can keep them around a little longer.<br />Fiona and Joe were residents of Whitechapel area in London ~~ an area where the workingclass lived and worked. It was full of rough labor men and their families. Though the gentry feared that area, people were relatively safe in that area till Jack the Ripper came along. Then everyone started staying home after dark. With that kind of environment, Joe and Fiona were great dreamers. Long in love with one another, they dreamt that someday they would have enough money to save up for their own shop. Only circumstances ~~ intentional and unintentional ~~ interfered with their plans and dreams. Fiona escaped London to New York to realize her dreams whereas Joe soared high then fell mighty before his dreams were realized. <br />Donnelly writes so passionately of the characters, keeping true to the Victorian period and its societal modes. Donnelly manages to weave a spell over the reader and keeps her/him enthralled with the characters, no matter where they are or from whatever station they are in life. These characters come alive ~~ dreamy Fiona raising her baby brother, Seamie. There is Joe struggling to make ends meet. There is Charlie, Fiona's much-adored brother who dreamed of going to America to make it rich there. There is Burton, the protaganist who owned the tea factory that the Flinnigan family were employed with ~~ and his dark eyes that haunts Fiona.

There is Uncle Michael and Paddy ~~ strong stalwart men who struggled to take care of the families. There is Roddy, the policeman who watches out for his people on his beat. And so on. All of these characters come alive in this hefty book. <br />Donnelly is a talented author ~~ one that people should keep an eye on. She is sure to go far with her writing!<br />2-14-03	2003-02-14

I don't know where Fielding gets it ~~ but she always manage to get me to keep turning the pages of her books! This one is so suspenseful that it was driving me nuts just to put the book down. <br />The book starts out with Donna Cressy fighting for the custody of her children. Her ex-husband Victor was painting a different sort of picture of Donna to get custody of the children. Then Fielding writes of the beginning of the marriage and it's downfall. Victor Cressy is the man who twists every single conversation that Donna carries with him into a raging psychological battle till you, the reader, begs for mercy! Donna begins to feel battered down and beaten ~~ not by flying fists but by the mental anguish she was going through. Nothing she did ever pleased the guy. So finally, she decided to end the marriage and the book gets even more interesting ~~ Victor told her that if she ever left him, he'd obliterate her. And he tried his best. <br />Fielding writes so convincingly of a broken marriage and a woman's fight for survival and fight for belief in herself. She writes so convincingly of Donna's plight when Victor kidnaps the children ~~ her fear and anger and helplessness. This book is every mother's nightmare. It is also every wife's nightmare. <br />I would not read this book at the beach or in front of the fireplace ~~ I would read it in bed with the covers over my head. This is a fright worse than monsters underneath the bed ~~ it could happen to you if it hasn't! And Fielding takes you right into a nightmarish marriage and its aftermath. She is well-known for her stories and the white-knuckle grip on the sheets, couch or wherever till the last page is turned. She won't fail you in this book!<br />2-7-03	2003-02-08

This book does the job real nicely. Cath, Josh and Lucy, Si always get together every Sunday for brunch to read the newspapers and gossip about their lives. Josh, Cath and Si have been friends since college. Then when another friend from their past shows up, everything seems to snowball into sometimes what is hilarious take on life. <br />The main character is Cath, a thirtyish single woman who gave up her high-paying job to open up a bookstore with Lucy, Josh's wife, a fabalous cook. Cath narrates the stories between friends and lovers ~~ always from the observer point of view. Then she meets and falls in love with the real estate agent who sold the shop to Lucy and her. In the meantime, she has to deal with the crisis that appears to loom over Lucy and Josh's marriage; with Si's love affair that ended diasterously; with her friendship with Portia, her best friend in college. <br />It is entertaining and keeps you turning the page. However, it is predictable, which is disappointing for me as I enjoy Green's books. It seems that I've read this book somewhere else or maybe the theme just keeps recurring among the thirtyish group. <br />If you are looking for something light to read, this book will be it. If you are looking for something that isn't predictable or will keep you in suspense, this book isn't for you. It is a fun book ~~ don't get me wrong. It's just typical reading, that's all. The subject matter isn't new and Green didn't really present a new outtake on this friendship/romantic outlook. It's great to take to the beach or to the slopes to read by the fireplace. It's pure escapism that's for sure. <br />2-5-03	2003-02-06

I was excited when I got this copy in the mail ~~ I love Hepinstall's writing style and have been looking forward to her new novel for awhile now. Again, she doesn't disappoint.<br />As a mother, I can totally relate to Martha, the main character in this book. She runs off to a cave off the Rio Grande with her son, Duncan because she wants to protect him after a child is murdered in front of his eyes. Her husband, David, hires a detective to find her ~~ and he does. However, he didn't let David know that he had found her ~~ instead he falls in love with her and Duncan. A chain of events ends in a totally unexpected climax. It is one of those reads where you cannot put the book down without being anxious to read the next page and the next ~~ Hepinstall keeps you coming back for more. <br />Hepinstall doesn't go into much details about the characters ~~ in this book, she doesn't have to. She focuses on what the characters are seeing or doing or are listening to ~~ and the scenery around them. She lets her descriptive powers come to life in this book. You literally see the glass lake with the blind fish that lies hidden in the cave. You feel the cold splash of the river nearby or hear the voices of tourists traveling down the river. You feel Duncan's joy in climbing the cliff to look at baby birds. You feel the terror Martha felt when awakening from a nightmare. There is a logical sense to all the of \\"ramblings\\" in this book ~~ just read it carefully and don't think too much to analayze everything ~~ just go with the flow. It is one of the most lyrical and haunting books you'll ever read. This book tugs at your heartstrings ~~ unlike her other books. <br />I will say this, Hepinstall really improves with every book. Not one of her books is alike. This book is not as dark as her first two books ~~ despite Martha's fear of reality and of the violence back in Ohio ~~ she protects her son with all she has in her and with all the love she feels. This is a story about a mother's love for her son and her desires to see him safe. It haunts you long after the last page is turned.<br />1-31-03	2003-02-01

Ok, I really hate to admit this ~~ but this book was just perfect to chase away those winter blues! It's funny, witty and so deliciously smutty that I couldn't put it down! I would put my babies on the playmat, let them play while I read pages of this book! It's a great escapism book ~~ and I plan to read more of Isaacs' books! She's really a good writer ~~ too bad the public doesn't know more of her!<br />This book is about Nicholas and Jane Cobleigh and their golden marriage. They appear to be the perfect couple ~~ the golden actor famous for his WASP looks and the exotic housewife, who stands behind her man with good cheer. Behind the scenes show a different picture. It's not a perfect marriage by any means ~~ over the course of 20 years, both Nicholas and Jane have evolved into different people with different lifestyles. They have drifted away and will they ever get back together? <br />Not only is this book about Nicholas and Jane ~~ it is about their respective parents as well. Jane is the daughter of an exotic dancer and a strait-laced businessman from the Midwest. Nicholas is the son of a wealthy Tuttle daughter ~~ one of the oldest families on the New England coastlines and a lawyer, whose family basically ignored him from the time he was born. Isaacs writes little of history and with her charm, she draws the reader into each of the characters' lives ~~ making you wish for more.<br />This is the second book I've read by Isaacs and I highly recommend this one. It's a fun book, guaranteed to draw you into a different world and time passes by in such a pleasant haze. It's perfect reading for those long winter nights.<br />1-28-03	2003-01-30

I expected the book to be sort of a frivilous read and it turned out to be a much darker book than that. It is very well-written. The characters are rich and thoughtfully drawn-out. The reader can almost sense the Cajun experience as well as a bored housewife and her family's stories. <br />Nita and Lois should have never gotten married. The author wrote that in the introductory paragraph ~~ and with that kind of a snag, the reader has to jump in and read the book. The book is dark and while depressing, one cannot put it down. Nita married Lois to get out from her stepfather's groping hands ~~ basically she just exchanged one guy for another. And ever since, Lois worked all that he had to make her happy ~~ always moving to a better house in a better neighborhood. Nita takes her frustrations out on her daughter and pours her dreams into her son till something happens to rock the foundation of this family. <br />I would have rated this book a five ~~ but it seems to be an abrupt ending to this book ~~ almost like it wasn't finished. Plus it was rather dark outlook on life ~~ very selfish and every man to himself. The author, however, devoted time and energy into each character to make it real and someone that the readers can relate to. It is an interesting book. <br />1-27-03	2003-01-28

With the passage of the Homeland Security Bill, I thought I'd better refresh my memory of this book. And this book is scarier than any Stephen King book ~~ it's scary because our future has arrived. With Big Brother watching our every move ...<br />The book is a reflection upon past times as well as the future ~~ it's a history of mankind. It is about power. It is about control ~~ one man over another. It is about power through total submission ~~ submersion of the self. It is not about the greater good of life or mankind. It is man at its very worst. Orwell took a deep look into despair and wrote bluntly about it. The surface of it is Big Brother watching every move you make ~~ till you get into the book and realize there is much more at sake. And it's so well-written. No matter that I wanted to put the book down and ignore it, I couldn't. I had to read it to the last page. And it's the scariest book I have ever read.<br />1-9-03	2003-01-10

A dear friend mailed this book to me ~~ and I have to say, it is a light and refreshing as well as honest look at motherhood and Hollywood. I have always liked Patricia Heaton in &quot;Everyone Loves Raymond&quot; ~~ and definitely like her better after reading her book. With a light touch, she talks about her life before and after becoming famous and being a mom. She tells her story with humor and grace ~~ and being a mom of two boys, I can relate to her experiences with motherhood and wifehood. What a fun book!<br />This is one of the better autobiographies I have read in awhile. Patricia is a down-to-earth woman who happens to live in la-la land called Hollywood. And after reading this book, I wish her well in future endeavors ~~ perhaps more on her family life would be wonderful! <br />If you're looking for a lighter and fun read to while away some free time, I highly recommend this book. It is a sure bet that you'll finish this book and beg for more. She's that good.<br />12-05-02	2002-12-05

If you like mysteries, this book is it. It is also very well-written ~~ like Agatha Christie mystery and clean too ~~ with a very few smattering of curse words or sex. It is just a novel based on a woman's dark secret and how it shattered the world around her....<br />This is a book that keeps you hopping from one page to another ~~ and you'll love to hate this selfish beauty as if you know her. Palmer brings [characters] to life with this novel....<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who has a few hours on her hands. These winter nights sure are long and this book will keep you entertained for a night in front of the fire.

This book is written in my favorite writing style ~~ it jumps from the present to the past and back to the present with a fluid style ~~ which makes it easy for the reader to know where she is at in the book. Stonich is a very talented writer who writes with passion and feelings as well as very powerful descriptive style. You, the reader, is right there with Isobel as she remembers her past as she lies there on her deathbed. You can see her memories as vividly as if you are right there with her ~~ Stonich has a imaginative writing style that not very writers can capture.<br />While on her deathbed, Isobel talks to her youngest and surviving child about the summer of 1936 when a young couple has disappeared and caused a scandal in the small town where they resided. What Thomas, her youngest son, didn't know is that Isobel knew the couple in question. She was often their look-out for them as they hide from the woman's husband during the afternoons of a hot summer. Isobel became very close to Kathryn even though she questioned Kathyrn's infidelity with Jack, a man who wanted to enter priesthood at one time. <br />This novel explores the relationships between husband and wife, between friends, lovers, children and parents. It tackles the question of infidelity, love, death and aging. Stonich has a wonderful way of drawing you in ~~ and leave you feeling like you've just returned from a lovely but hard journey. She makes you think and question what you're reading ~~ in a delightful way. This isn't a trivial novel ~~ but it's not hard on the eyes either. This isn't a forgettable book. I recommend this to all readers.<br />	2002-11-19

I fell in love with Joy Fielding with her book, Grand Avenue, and whenever I go anywhere, I am always on the lookout for her books. She didn't disappoint here either ~~ she writes with her usual blend of mystery, spice and love ~~ and it's absolutely wonderful!!<br />Happily married with a beautiful daughter, Bonnie Wheeler thinks she has it made ~~ till her husband's ex-wife was murdered and she became the prime suspect in a whirlwind murder investigation. Then everything in Bonnie's pristine world falls apart ~~ people aren't who they seem to be. Her father and brother ~~ the two men she was estranged from for so long ~~ reappears in her life, causing her to question her upbringing. Rod, her loving husband, is always working early and late at the TV station where he works, and his children suddenly become her responsibility when their mother died ~~ and so on. Fielding takes you on a whirlwind ride through Bonnie's hunt for justice and the truth as she runs from the murderer. <br />This is a quick read ~~ don't read it if you don't have hours to spare because you cannot put this book down at all!! Just like Grand Avenue, it is a book with a twist at the end ~~ just when you figure out who the murderer is ~~ you're caught off guard. This is a spooky book because it is realistic as well. Enjoy this book with the lights on and the curtains pulled ~~ and the doors locked! It makes for a great reading on those upcoming long winter nights...	2002-11-07

This is a fun book for me to read ~~ I think I found it at a library booksale and it was a quick and fun read. It is a mystery/romance novel ~~ the first Robards book I have ever read. <br />Molly Ballard, working as a groomer at a Kentucky stable while raising her younger brothers and sisters, runs into trouble with the law when she spirits away $5,000 that the FBI had planted in one of the barns. She was planning to use the money to feed her brothers and sisters, but FBI agent Will Lyman thought otherwise. Once he realized that she was speaking the truth, he decided to use Molly as an insider to investigate a race-horsing fixing scheme. Only Lyman got more than he bargained for ~~ not only was he focusing on the race-horsing fixing scheme, there were horse mulitations happening, a unsolved murder case, and a suicide in the peaceful Kentucky countryside. And falling in love with Molly ~~ it all provides entertainment and mystery throughout the book. <br />I would have given this book a 5 if it weren't for some explicit sex scenes in the book ~~ I am one of the readers who likes to be teased, not told of every sexual act in the story. Must be the midwestern in me. Other than that, this book provides great entertainment for me ~~ a fast read, which is something I need around here in a house full of happenings and it's fun to read as well. <br />If I run across Robards' other books, I'll be sure to pick them up since I enjoyed this book. She is a new author for me to explore and this book is hard to put down. I don't regret picking this one up at all. <br />11-7-02	2002-11-07

Before I became a mom ~~ I was in the rat race wondering when the struggles would cease and I would find the joy in life again. It is amazing how when you become a new parent that you search for the meaning of life. And this book sums up what I have been learning the past year. It is not a book to speed read through ~~ you have to soak in the conversations between Mitch and his mentor, Morrie. And this is definitely one book I plan to keep for my sons to read when they are older.<br />Mitch writes easily of the conversations he shared with his professor and he writes movingly of life's simple lessons. We all tend to get so wrapped up in the \\"keeping up with the Jones'\\" lifestyle, that we forget what is really important in this life. And Mitch writes to remind us of the simpler pleasures as well. It is ok to cry. It is ok to be afraid of death. It is ok to envy ~~ just don't let all these things consume you that you miss out on life itself. We only live here once ~~ and the lesson here is ~~ don't miss out on it. Is it really important to have a new car? Or a new house? Or new clothes or whatever your heart desires? When you are on your deathbed, are you going to have a lot of regrets or are you going to celebrate your life as it was and move on? <br />Also, this book tackles the touchy subject of death ~~ something most people tend to avoid talking let alone think about. And Mitch did a wonderful job of conveying Morrie's thoughts on this subject as death slowly stalked him. It is a book written about a man slowly facing death ~~ and you feel like you're listening to an intimate conversation between two men ~~ and learn as well. <br />I highly recommend this book to others. This is a book for every serious thinker and reader in this world. It is something to discuss with others and perhaps maybe make one slow down and really look at life again. That is the major lesson I've gleamed from this little book!<br />10-28-02	2002-10-29

On a blind date that she accepted even though it was really for her neighbor, Nancy finds her Mr. Right and was led on a merry chase. Stolen jewelry, a neglected child, a best friend with zany advices and romance make up for a wonderful and quick read!

Once she confided his infidelity to her circle of close friends, it was leaked to the media that the queen of communication couldn't even keep her marriage together ~~ she began to lose everything. Desperate to keep her practice, she decides to target a CEO of a huge corporation known as the world's meanest CEO and try to convert him to womenspeak. And the adventures began! <br />This book has it all ~~ romance, mystery and betrayal. Lynn was left to figure out just who she could trust among her girlfriends while trying to convince her new romantic interest that it wasn't her that leaked the information that she was working with him on womanspeak ~~ but I have to admit that it was a tad predictable. Which is sad because Heller's strength usually lies in the motto ~~ expected the unexpected ~~ only it didn't work in this novel.<br />If you're looking for a quick and entertaining read, this book would be it. However, don't expect it to measure up to Heller's other books!<br />10-28-02	2002-10-29

Gib Cameron was a man from their parents' past and what he offered sounded too good to be true ~~ but the sisters took him up on his offer and came to visit the Camerons in the Tennessee mountains ~~ thus beginning an adventure that ended in love for the sisters as well as family ties.<br />This book is well-written ~~ Smith has such descriptive powers that it is amazing. You as the reader feel as if you're right there in the beautiful mountains ~~ and you're a part of the characters' lives. Venus is a saucy character ~~ one that is tough on the outside (her battles with Ruth, one of the Camerons, are hilarious ~~ she always has a smart aleck comeback for this snooty lawyer) but gentle inside. Ella, the other sister, is a dreamy character who believes in the goodness of life. She influences her sister more than anyone has ~~ till Gib Cameron came into their lives. Gib, a strong man that has endured physical and mental tragedies, is the hero that most women secretly long for. Flawed and yet strong. <br />This isn't a book to be forgotten ~~ like I mentioned earlier, it is a really fun and romantic novel.

I have a sister and I have to confess, our relationship is not that volatile like Deborah has with her sister Jennifer. We don't hit each other and we definitely do not make cracks about each other's choices in our spouses, kids, jobs and stuff like that. Which is why this book is so entertaining!! <br />Deborah and Jennifer have come to a temporary truce to halt their bickering when their mother gets a heart attack and asked her girls to stop fighting and start getting along. However, they decided their mother's cardiologist was just a gem they couldn't resist passing over ~~ they were discovered arguing outside his house and over his dead body by the police. That is when the adventures begin. Deborah had just moved down to Florida from New York to be close to her mother, and this is what happens. She gets smacked dob in the middle of a murder investigation. Unable to sit still, she involves herself in asking all known suspects questions and pass her tips onto the police department. In the meantime, Jennifer gets hooked up with a sleazy attorney and no matter what Deborah says to her ~~ Jennifer is convinced that this is Husband Four.

I read it entirely in a day and had such a blast with it! I don't recall laughing this much over some of the sarcastic remarks other people make in books ~~ and Deborah, in my opinion, is a fun character. Her sister, Jennifer, will get on your nerves especially when you realize that Deborah is doing everything she can to help protect her older sister. Their mother is a fun gem ~~ sparkly and lively at the age of 75. The sleezeball attorney reeks of crookedness just by Heller's descriptions and on it goes. And Deborah's love interest sounds divine ~~ manly and sensitive. It goes on. It's just a fun book ~~ nothing too deep to lose sleep over and it'sperfect for those who are restricted to bed rest, hospital stays or home recovering from the flu ~~ it's just fun!<br />6-28-02	2002-06-29

It's enough for me to want to do research on my family heritage myself!<br />Elisabeth, Suzette, Philemon and Emily all have their own stories to share ~~ of those long ago days in the plantations, of being submissive to their masters and mistresses, of dreams born and crushed, loss of life's mates and children through sales or death, facing prejudice just because of their skin color, and so forth. It is a story within stories of voices heard throughout the years. These women are exceptional ~~ simply because they held onto their dreams of keeping their families together. They did what they had to do to survive and they make no apologies in doing so. They are women of courage and bravery ~~ women that all women want to be like. <br />And not only are their stories riveting, Tademy includes personal items of her research in finding her family's roots ~~ sales bills, letters and pictures. Tademy gives her ancestors the voices to reach out from beyond the grave to share with us what life was like in the 1800s ~~ especially for women of color. They are not your typical mammys or Harriet Tubmans ~~ they are just women struggling to stay alive and living for each day as it comes. Tademy makes each one of her ancestors come alive with voices of their own ~~ something this reader really appreciates! It's one of the best historical fiction/biography she has read in ages ~~ since Roots. It's humbling to read about other women with courage and spirit ~~ it makes one realize just how easy life is nowadays.<br />I honestly recommend this book to anyone who has a desire to know more about history. It's one of the best books you'll read in a long time ~~ this is not one of Oprah's gloomy picks. No, it'san enlightening and uplifting story ~~ despite all the racial prejudices and truths, these women still kept their heads up high. It's wonderfully written and refreshing as well.

There must be something to be said about being pregnant and on bedrest ~~ there are so many books out there I would have never dreamed of reading ~~ nor have the time to really appreciate reading ~~ and this book is definitely one of them! This book promises to touch your heart and soul ~~ especially if you like reading books about mothers and daughters. <br />It all begins in Memphis, in an orthodox Jewish community, where Batsheva moves into this tiny and close-knit community. With Batsheva's arrival, the precarious relationships between the Ladies Auxiliary and their daughters are shaken to the core. Their daughters long to be free of the traditions that they deemed to be restricting ~~ and their mothers are just as stubborn as to holding them to the traditions that make them the women that they are. And soul-searching questions have been brought into this book ~~ religious freedom ~~ what exactly is that? The struggles between mothers and daughters ~~ fighting against tradition and beliefs and self, and personal revelations. This is a book that every mother and daughter should read ~~ even if they are not Orthodox Jews.<br />I really enjoyed this book for its witty conversations ~~ how Mirvis takes you into each character's minds and souls as they struggle through each day with new revelations that comes their way. Mirvis brings the age-old questions into mind as you read this book ~~ just exactly what do women want from their lives as they work together in a religious community? What exactly do mothers expect from their daughters? What do their daughters expect from their lives and from their mothers? Mirvis explores those questions thoroughly in this book ~~ and also adds the old-fashioned southern charm and wit into this book! It's a guaranteed read ~~ you will not be able to put this book down till the last page is turned!!<br />6-26-02	2002-06-27

But I have to confess that it took me several times to pick this book up. The subject matter hits too close to home ~~ a young boy gets molested by an adult and his mother is wracked with guilt and sorrow that she wasn't there to protect him from the evil ones of the world. But once I got through the first chapters and really started digging into the story, I started empathizing with the parents, Caleb and Nina, especially with Nina. Nina is a prosecutor who knows how the judical system fails the young ones by oftentimes slapping the offenders on the wrist and the young ones are the ones who suffer years of nightmares. And she was determined that it wasn't going to happen to her son.<br />And the story gets better. With the complex weaving among the characters, the reader gets a sense that not just Nathaniel is affected by the abuse, but every one close to Nathaniel is affected by it and how they choose to react to the abuse is what makes this story tick. It is very well-detailed and well-written from different perspectives on how to handle something this monstrous to your child. It is not an enjoyable read ... it isn't something that you can just pick up and say, ah. Perfect for the beach. No, it's perfect for a rainy day inside and with time to experience the reactions of every character in this book. It's also a time-consuming book ~~ you don't want to rush through it ... you want to know exactly what Nina and Caleb and others are thinking about ... and you still get surprises after surprises.<br />This is not my favorite Picoult book, but it is one that you won't forget easily!<br />6-7-02	2002-06-07

And fortunately, this one is well-written and it grabs you by the throat and won't let go till the last page has turned. <br />Casey is a star defense attorney who takes pride in being number one, till a sordid murder trial made her take stock of her life and where she was going with that life. Casey was asked by her old professor, Dr. Lipton, to represent him in this horrorific murder trial and he claimed that he was innocent of this woman's murder. Casey won the case for him ... only to have the serial-like murders continue to happen. And the adventure has just begun.<br />It is a quick read ~~ I finished it in one day. It's also a page-turning read as well. If you're looking for a good book to read on that long airplane flight, I'd recommend this one. Green will keep you guessing throughout the book ... and you better make sure that you didn't miss your connecting flight ... it's that good that you can't just put it down.<br />6-7-02	2002-06-07

Whenever I hear that Marian Keyes has written another book, I automatically put it on my wish list ~~ and a dear online reading buddy sent it to me as a baby shower gift! What a blessed afternoon I got to spend reading about Maggie Walsh's escapades in Los Angeles. Worth every page of it!<br />Maggie Walsh Garvin is the \\"responsible\\" Walsh daughter. She didn't have her husband leave her the day she delivered her baby like her older sister Clare. She didn't experiment with drugs like her other sister, Rachel did. She was the one who seems to be perfect in every way ~~ married to a respectable man (whom her family members only think she married because she \\"settled\\" at a young age) with a good job. What could go wrong? <br />When a box of chocolate truffles caused her husband, Garv, to say something that enlightened her to the realization that her husband was cheating on her, Maggie's adventures to self-realization has only just begun. After staying with her parents moping for a few months, Maggie decided to mope in L.A. What could go wrong there? She's with her best friend Emma, there's the sunshine and the beach close by and maybe men to keep Maggie's mind off her failed marriage. And what a fun and sometimes riotous adventure!! <br />Maggie tried to downplay her \\"straight\\" image only to rediscover that she cannot change who she is. She runs into an old flame and secrets from her past tumbles forth. Maggie has to make a decision ~~ a decision that could affect the rest of her life.<br />Marian Keyes writes like she knows you. Out of all the Walsh's sisters, Maggie is the one I most identify with. And Marian does a wonderfully good job of bringing Maggie to life ~~ it makes one gasp and say, I know her! This is me!! And while writing so realistically sometimes, Keyes also takes you away from your daily life for a few moments. I couldn't even put the book down in the doctor's office ~~ and my husband was sitting next to me! And like usual, Marian writes with her own flair that you'd recognize anywhere. She's definitely one of my favorite authors and one to keep. She doesn't have a formula writing style yet ~~ like a lot of those contemporary authors do ~~ which is why she keeps you on your toes while reading this! Don't hesitate to pick up this newest one ~~ it'll be worth your while!<br />6-7-02	2002-06-07

I am in my third trimester with twins and with their impending arrival coming anytime, I thought I'd better brush up on breast-feeding techniques. And thankfully, someone from La Leche recommended this book to me! I even made my husband read it. <br />It is chock full of good suggestions and little things to keep one aware of what breast-feeding twins really consist of. It gives one an idea of the average time of breastfeeding ... how often, how to handle both of them at once, what to do when only feeding one of them at a time ... it just gives a good idea of what to expect. And it's extremely helpful for this first-time mother! It helps allay the panic that I've been feeling ever since the doctor said, well, they can come anytime, so be prepared!<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone ~~ even though my copy was dated from 1985 ~~ it is still sensible advice for new moms.<br />6-7-02	2002-06-07

While this book didn't leave me laughing till my ribs ache ~~ it sure did give me an interesting perspective on southern humor. Florence King is an excellent writer who takes you down memory lane ~~ you cannot help but relate to her descriptions of people in her life. However, I am a pure Yankee ~~ so a lot of the humor about gleaming silver and dusty houses just flew over my head. (Up here in Ohio, we're neat and clean ~~ a Malkin society that Florence describes so wonderfully!) However, I enjoyed reading about Florence's outlook on life and how she handled her disappointments and her realization that family does matter ~~ all done with humor and dry wit. <br />This is a quick read for me ~~ King keeps me riveted to each page with her descriptions of daily life in the south and with her love affairs. It was nice to read about someone else struggling with the society's mores ~~ and how she dealt with it. Though I may not have come up with the same conclusions as she did ~~ she handles her with lots of grace and laughter. A rare gift anymore in this staid society.<br />Pick this book up and you'll enjoy it. Be sure to kick off your shoes, drink a glass of lemonade and swing on the porch. Enjoy the sultry summer heat of the southern humor. It's a great book to while away a lazy afternoon.<br />5-28-02	2002-05-28

Without a minute hesitation, I picked this book up and didn't regret it! Like Trudy, I am pregnant and having a character going through the same emotions, mood swings and hormonal changes ~~ really helps me to take my pregnancy lightly!! It is fun to have a character going through some of the same things you're going through!!<br />I have never heard of Sarah Bird, but I am really enjoying this novel. I must confess it was hard going at first, but kept plugging away and now, it's a really enjoyable book that I couldn't put down! I would never be a surrograte mom ~~ especially after reading about how Hilary keeps grabbing the moments away from Trudy ~~ pretending to have the same morning sickness, gaining sympathy weight and keeping a strict eye on Trudy ~~ making her eat wholesome food like brussel sprouts and spinach while she eats whatever she wants to eat ~~ all for the baby. It gets better!<br />It's a fun read ~~ something I'd consider passing onto my pregnant friends to help them forget the aches and pains that accompany every pregnancy for a few hours. It's a quick read as well ~~ and now, I'll be interested in any other Sarah Bird book I can lay hands on!! What a wonderful debut to a new author!<br />5-28-02	2002-05-28

It was her most recent novel, Grand Avenue, that got me interested in reading more of Fielding's books. And this one didn't disappoint at all!! It is refreshingly honest, gripping and delved into the myriads of familial relationships even before diaster strikes! <br />Mattie Hart has spent almost 16 years playing wife to hot-shot defense attorney Jake Hart ~~ quietly ignoring the signs of his numerous affairs. She raised their daughter, the reason why they got married, Kim as best as she could. Not saying that Mattie is the perfect wife or mother ~~ she has made some mistakes in her lifetime as well ~~ but when she found out she was stricken with ASL or Lou Gehrig's disease, her whole world tumbled. Jake had already moved out and started living with his newest paramour ~~ only to move home to take care of Mattie. And this is their story. Theirs and Kim's. <br />Families aren't always strong as it appears to the public ~~ Jake Hart's glowing image got tarnished throughout the story as he struggled with issues related to his marriage and childhood. Ultimately, he decided on one course and saw it to the end ~~ much to Mattie's great surprise. Kim, usually the perfect beautiful daughter, gets in trouble constantly at school or at home ~~ unable to totally understand what is really going on in her life and with her mother. She comes to realization later on as well ~~ accepting the fact that they all are human. Mattie ~~ the star of this book manages to live her life and lies gracefully ~~ though the disease ravaged her body. Some of the dreams she had never known she had held managed to come to the surface ~~ and she learns to deal with them as well as the fact that she is dying. <br />This book strikes a chord in this reader's heart. Family relationships aren't always easy but if you stick them out, they turn out to be the greatest blessings. Fielding does a wonderful job of sharing her characters' thoughts and views as life they know it tumbles around them. And they manage to deal with Mattie's dying with grace and humor ~~ after a long, bitter fight.<br />I have to admit, this is another book you can't just put down and forget about for a few days. You'll be grabbed by the characters' voices and dreams ~~ you'll know them as intimately as you know a friend or even yourself. And be prepared to have kleenexes nearby. It's a book you won't quickly forget!<br />5-20-02	2002-05-21

In fact, it seems that Jude writes better everytime she gets a new book out!!<br />A brief meeting between three women at NYC DMV center leads to a reunion 19 years later. The paths these three women took in life only led to sadness and pain for all three of them. They gave up their dreams and aspirations for the men in their lives and when they got together to celebrate their 40th birthday, they commisserated in their misery. Upon discovering Madame Zoya's business card, they decided that maybe they can go back into time and &quot;fix&quot; what went wrong in their lives ~~ a second chance to regain control over their lives.

I have to admit that at first, I couldn't get into this novel at all. It just wasn't going anywhere and maybe it was because it started out just like all the other novels I've read lately ~~ very slow. After a few chapters, I was able to dig in the story and really enjoy myself. I read to escape for a few hours ~~ totally losing myself into the beauty of words ~~ and this book did the trick.<br />Eliza is a struggling thirty-something woman who has no career and hates every job she does and she is dating Gregor, an actor who doesn't seem to appreciate her for who she is. Her sister, Bette, is everything Eliza is not. Perfect older sister wrapped up in the ivory tower as she writes her dissertation on English novels and toast. Eliza could always rely on Bette to be there for her ~~ till Bette falls in love and gets pregnant and moves out to L.A. Eliza flies to L.A. to be with her sister when she finds out that Gregor had cheated on her with a producer of &quot;All My Children&quot; ~~ a soap show that Gregor auditioned for and won a part on.<br />This book is about the complex relationships between lovers and sisters. Eliza struggles with losing her sister and finding &quot;herself&quot; in the midst of life's chaos and this makes it worthwhile. Every woman has gone through a period in her life where she just doesn't know where she is going to be next. Or who she is. You can relate to Eliza ~~ she's lovable as well as annoying ~~ like a younger sister can be. And then when it's Bette's turn to be annoying ~~ it's a breath of relief because then you know that the &quot;perfect&quot; older sister can be so no perfect. These two characters are fun and easily related to.<br />If you have a sister or a very close friend whom you consider a sister ~~ I highly recommend this book to read. It's fun and light ~~ yet with more substance than a sugar-coated bread and butter. It's a fun novel to while away a rainy day.<br />5-13-02	2002-05-14

Fathered by different men and raised by a single mother, Eve describes a non conventional family whose various talents are always at odd with the rest of society.

How she got there and what happens after the court case are what makes this novel so unique. I can't tell you too much ~~ only pick up this book and read for yourself!<br />I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a first-person narration ~~ but this one beats all. Gregory writes very vividly and with imagery ~~ and she never lets you forget the plotline of the story. She keeps switching back and forth from Eve's childhood to adulthood, but the switch is done so gently as if she is a master storyteller. She is a master storyteller ~~ one of the best I've encountered in a long time.

After reading the first book, Sister of My Heart, one cannot comprehend how another book can be just as eloquent or beautifully written as that book was. Your heart goes into the lives of Sudha and Anjou. And this book defies all expectations and draws you into their lives even further ~~ this time you really watch them grow up into independent women. This time you suffer along with them the confusion of adultery, losing a much-loved baby, losing all the Indian identities that bind them into what they perceive as rigid roles in society, finding themselves stronger for it. And woven into the tapestry of their lives, are stories and myths from India ~~ a heritage that they can never completely escape from. You watch them make decisions that affect their lives, relationships with one another and other people, and watch them grow into truly deeply beautiful women. <br />Divakaruni writes with such beauty and prose and passion ~~ you cannot help but be carried along by the beauty of her stories and words. It is a book to be treasured and re-read again and again. It's such a lyrical book ~~ but yet it holds profound thoughts of relationships between two women who have grown up together and watch how the twists and turns of life try to tear them apart. And the two cousins come to the realization that neither can live her life for the other ~~ they have their own lives to live. It is a heartwrenching story propelled by Anjou's husband's desire for Sudha ~~ but yet, those two women become stronger. They become women in every sense of the word. <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoy reading books about other women and their relationships among themselves. It's also a poetic book as well ~~ a book to savor each word as it is written and hold closely to your heart. It is an eloquent book to keep and re-read again and again. It speaks of the desires and dreams we all keep close to our hearts ~~ and how sometimes life disappoints us ~~ but we keep on striving tofind that deep joy we once knew as children.

Some places are soft and gentle then it comes crashing down with the heavy tomes of truth and finishes with a clash of joy. It's not your typical reading.<br />Clodagh is a young woman who have spent the years of her life looking for something that was missing from her life. Her twin, Mare, died when she was a child. Agatha, her mother, was distant and aloof with Clodagh and Clodagh never felt that her mother loved her. So when Agatha died, Clodagh found her solace in music ~~ playing the piano. Only that didn't fulfill her for long and she falls in love with a man who somehow holds the clue to her mother's past. <br />Clodagh is a complex character ~~ you can't help but feel her anguish when she searches for what she is looking for. You can't help but admire her tenacity to hold onto life even at its darkest moments. She is a strong and yet weak character traveling between two worlds ~~ one of life and one of death. <br />This is an interesting book ~~ but don't expect it to be a light and fluffy read like my usual reads have been. It's full of dark underlying tones that makes you either uncomfortable or anxious to explore it. It was hard for me to keep reading on some pages because it was so dark ~~ depressing almost. But I can guarantee that you will want to finish this book and find out what has happened to Clodagh. She is a character that you will not soon forget.<br />4-29-02	2002-04-29

I happened to see this book and knew that it was going to be a fun read ~~ it has all the ingredients I look for in a book ~~ saucy, sexy and hilarious. Sissy LeBlanc, without trying to, stirs up trouble wherever she goes. Married to PeeWee, Sissy realizes that she is bored in her marriage. When a high school flame breezed in from out of town, she hooks up with him and trouble ensues in their path. <br />It has the perfect characters ~~ there is the wimpy husband, Peewee who could never stand up to his father, there's the father-in-law who is evil to the core; there is the psychopathic older son, Chip, who uses his mother's trangressions to his benefits, as well as torturing people and dogs with his chemistry set; the adorable middle son, Billy Joe and the cute little daughter, Marilee. There is Parker, the old high school flame who could never get Sissy out of his mind; Belle, the sassy grandmother who is proud of her granddaughter; the cousin who is of mixed race and how Sissy trys to help her to get ahead to college. There is the typical nosey-body neighbor who couldn't wait to tell Peewee about his wife's sin ... and so forth. These characters will stick with you long after the last page is turned. <br />Written with typical southern dry wit and humor ~~ this book is absolutely perfect for people to take on vacation. You'll fall in love with Sissy and her pickled watermelon rinds. You'll enjoy reading about her scandalous summer in 1956 where she shocked everyone in Gentry with her love affair with Parker. You'll find yourself rooting for her as well. This is just a great book to read! It was a near-miss for me ~~ one that I am glad to have picked up!...	2002-04-26

If reality hasn't intruded into my daily life, I think I would have finished this book in an afternoon. It's that engrossing. <br />This book explores the relationships between Kate and Lucy ~~ two women with two children and their husbands. It is a complicated relationship burdened with secrets and dreams. When Lucy finds out that her son is diagonosed with cystic fibrosis, the relationships began to unravel. <br />I would have given this book a five ~~ but when Lucy blurted out her great secret, it was written very awkwardly and there wasn't enough depth into the story to give the readers why she panicked like she did. And Lucy was way too pact with her husband's trangressions with her best friend ~~ if it was me, despite me making the same mistake seven years earlier ~~ I would still be raging and fighting for my husband instead of taking everything passively and hiding my head. <br />Other than that, this book is well-written and enjoyable!! I really hated to put it down ~~ as I want some answers to my questions! But it is thoroughly enjoyable! I highly recommend this book to anyone with an afternoon off from work. It's one of those lazy days to spend on this book. Take it out to your hammock and swing in the spring breeze while reading this book!<br />4-25-02	2002-04-25

It's not a deep, thought-provoking book by any means, but if you're five months pregnant like me ~~ you wouldn't care! It's written with passion and it keeps you turning the pages. <br />Catherine Elliot comes from a moneyed family; her parents threw her out on the streets when she refused to attend college. Down on her luck, she stumbles into a flowershop and found her destiny there. After several years of working there, she eventually buys the shop and renames it Bloom. And it becomes this huge success in New York City. Much more than she ever dreamed of.<br />It's not all work for Catherine. She manages to fall in love twice ~~ once with Kit, a Bostonian lawyer whose family would never accept Catherine. He leaves her to marry someone else. Then there's Piet Vanderveld, a dark-eyed Dutch who works with her first along the first flower shop then became her partner in Blooms. <br />Catherine's family also plays strong roles in this novel as well and it was interesting to see how they all perceive Catherine in the end. It doesn't matter that she has worked hard to provide for them ~~ they still expected more of her.<br />It was an interesting novel ~~ I finished it in a day. I was amazed when a friend of mine told me that this book was out of print ~~ I think it should be back in print! It's such a good read ~~ fun, saucy, sexy and entertaining! If you can get a hold of a copy of this book, I'd urge you to read it. It's perfect for those long lazy days at the beach or at the poolside.<br />...	2002-04-24

This is my first book by Elaine Kagan and I have my librarian to thank for that. She wrote her name down on my slip and said, try her. And I picked this one up in a hurry ~~ and it was one of the nicest books I've read in a long time.<br />As an expectant mother, I cannot imagine ever giving up my babies. I cannot imagine losing the love of my life ~~ nor have my parents take me away from him and make me give up our children. But as I was reading this book, the images still came to mind and Kagan's words are vivid enough to imagine the terror, the sorrows and the pain that Jenny must have gone through to give up her baby. Hers and Will ~~ the only man she has ever loved. <br />Then Claudia, the baby, begins a search to find an identity of herself ~~ she knew she was adopted ~~ her adoptive parents have never withheld the truth from her ~~ and she wanted to know where she got her looks from, her mannerisms ~~ to find the missing pieces of herself. And the search led to finding both of her biological parents. The search also opened up a new world for Claudia ~~ she was one of the lucky ones. All of her parents wanted her. She was the blessed one. <br />I really enjoyed this book ~~ I had to put it down a couple of times to avoid crying over parts of it. And Kagan is a good writer ~~ she writes with passion and vividness. She takes you into her story and you can't easily escape from it without thinking of the issues she's trying to make you think about. In this case, adoption is a little-known subject for me ~~ and it opened my eyes to all the sides of the issues. However, I wish she did explore a little more about Claudia's adoptive dad's feelings about Claudia meeting her biological father. Dads are just as important to a child's life as the mothers are. <br />This is a good read ~~ I highly recommend it. The story will enrapture you and you would want to know if Claudia's biological parents ever did find each other again. <br />4-14-02	2002-04-14

It's cute and sassy and spunky ~~ but I am kinda disappointed that it wasn't as funny as I had hoped! And it's shallow writing too. It didn't explore the relationship between the sisters like I had hoped. I have a sister and we're two very different people ~~ she was the pretty one and I was the smart one ~~ and our lives are finally getting similar and I picked this book up in hopes that it would be a good reading. It is good reading ~~ perfect for any day at the lake or campsite ~~ but it just didn't cut the surface of relationships with me.<br />Frank (the smart one) and Amanda (the pretty one) are facing bankruptcy with their little coffee shop and possibly losing their apartment when Clarissa, a deliciously dressed stranger breezed into their shop and promised to save it. And the adventures begin. Their story takes you for a twist and turns throughout the book ~~ which is fun and sassy trying to figure out who the real murderer was ~~ the coffee shop manager next door or someone else? And in the process, the sisters find true love. <br />It is a cute book ~~ don't get me wrong. Just don't expect it to explore the relationship between the two sisters ~~ there is one but it's superficial. Take this book for a light fluffy read on the beach or lakeside. You won't be disappointed there.<br />4-11-02	2002-04-12

I don't recall ever hearing much about the Johnstown Flood in 1889 and I am embarrassed to say so. However, I am glad that I had an opportunity to read this beautifully written book. And I was able to get a small glimpse of what the flood was about over 200 years ago.<br />Kathleen Cambor writes with prose on a select few characters whose lives are entertwined with the Club and Johnstown. She also writes with passion ~~ diviluging subtle sides to the rich men involved in this tragedy as well as men who protested against the building of the lake which ended up overflowing and killing almost 2,000 people during a Memorial Day rainstorm. There is Nora, the daughter of one of the lawyers who protested for the repairs on the dam ~~ whose life became entangled with Daniel Fallon, who lost his whole family in the flood. There is Andrew Mellon pining away for his dead financee; Andrew Carnegie entrapped by his mother's rule; Henry Clay Frick whose main concern is his comfort and prosperity. Cambor brings them all to life within this novel.<br />If you are a fan of historical fiction like I am ~~ I highly recommend reading this book. It will spark an interest in a tragedy that happened long ago and it was a tragedy that could have been prevented ~~ if men weren't so obstinate in denying that there was a problem. Even today, one cannot still imagine the depth of human lives lost ~~ it's too much to comprehend. But Cambor gave some of the victims voices in which they could share their lives, dreams, goals and aspirations. You can hear their voices haunting you as you read this book.<br />I think this is a must-read. It's not slow-paced like I feared ~~ it was very moving and the story sweeps you along with the voices and soon, you realize the tragedy is not just in the fact that the dam failed ~~ but in the fact that men simply don't care. <br />4-6-02	2002-04-06

My favorite part of the whole book was the trip to the spa with Luke's mom ~~ it was something unreal and totally unexpected ~~ and funny. <br />I am looking forward to reading about Becky and Luke's preparations for the wedding ~~ being newly married that is something I can totally relate to!!! So I am hoping for a third book as well ~~ and hopefully, it'll be funnier than this one is!<br />(P.S.

But she didn't go into depth ~~ it's almost as if she wrote this book in a hurry as it's not typical of her writing style at all. <br />It's still a good read ~~ but save it for the afternoon at the beach. <br />4-5-02	2002-04-05

A group of reading buddies recommended this book in an online book club and since I was in the mood for something what I thought would be light and trivial ... I grabbed it at the library without a second thought. This book should have come with a warning. You cannot just put this book down to do chores or go to work. This book must be consumed in matter of hours because Fielding keeps you guessing throughout the whole book. Just when you think you have one of the characters figured out, you find another twist and turn. <br />A group of four women who live on Grand Avenue in Cincinnati formed deep friendships with one another over the years as their daughters grew up. There is Barbara, a former beauty queen, intent on keeping her marriage with her professor husband. There is Susan who was juggling college and motherhood. There was Chris who sacrificed everything to keep her family together while bowing to her husband's whims and maniac jealousy. There was Vicki, the superwoman who is also a top lawyer in Cincinnati. These women are very different from one another but the bond of attachment they have for one another is deep and solid ~~ till circumstances changed their lives.<br />This is a wonderful book about friendships between women and how despite everything it changes over the years. It is also a fast-paced novel ~~ best to be savored in one day. So I highly recommend you take the day off, turn the phone off the hook, lock the doors, send the kids to a babysitter ~~ and it'll be worth that couple of hours just to read this book. It is a fast-paced page-turner. One that I would read again! It's not a cheesy book either ~~ it is written with real emotion and passion. <br />So what are you waiting for?

It's wonderful! It's cute and pardon the pun ~~ it's adorable. (I don't think the author would like that term applied to his book!)<br />Jon, a single dad and doctor, is attempting to go back into the world after his wife's death in childbirth and what ensues is a series of misfortunate and hilarious accidents. (I have to say that Nick Earls sure knows his cats! I am almost tempted to ask him if my cat was the basis of Flag, the cat hero in this book!) Anyhow, one day he was just dad to Lily and a dermatologist in a busy practice then the next day, he's juggling between two women. Katie is the woman trapped in the 80s with the 80s hairdo that Jon and his office mates secretly joke about. Ash is the jogging partner that makes his mind go around in circles. Jon is left juggling his feelings for Ash while trying to let Katie down gently. That is where Flagg comes in. Flagg decides that he likes Jon ~~ and Jon seems to be extremely clumsy where the cat is concerned. (My husband laughed and laughed over choice parts of the book.)<br />I really can't go into too much details about this book because if I do, I will ruin it for the next person to read this review. All I can say is buy this book and see for yourself. Earls writes with humor and grace about a single dad slowly feeling his way back into the world after his wife's death. He also writes with feeling about Jon's coming to grips with his wife's death and becoming a father. Jon may be bewildered and confused at times, but what father wouldn't be? And it is just one of the best short reads I've read this year. <br />If Earls has more books out in the States, I'll be sure to pick them up. He is a talent to watch out for.<br />...	2002-03-21

It was one of the riveting reads of the year. If my mom hadn't loaned it to me, I would have never heard of it.<br />This is your typical mystery but it is so untypical how Mills twist and turn all the clues till you, as the reader, are clueless along with Max, the heroine of the book. However, you do start guessing the outcome and hold your breath in hopes you're right. What a read!!!<br />Max had just spent seven years in jail for protecting her daughter, Gaby. She refused to let her ex-husband, a Judge, to have anything to do with Gaby since he is a monster.

The only reason why I rate it two stars is because the writing is good. But this book left me cold. As a recent bride, this book just left me depressed. I didn't have the same experiences ~~ nagging my husband into marrying me, bragging about the fact that my ring is more expensive than his ... and all that jazz. Eve is a selfish bride desperate to get married before the age of 38. And Michael is just a dreamboat of a man who is a typical man. <br />This book just depresses me. Maybe it's because my wedding was absolutely beautiful and wonderful ... and romantic. My Michael isn't like Eve's Michael ~~ always griping about the cost or anything like that. My Michael wanted to have a beautiful wedding to celebrate our union together as man and wife ... but we didn't focus so much on the wedding as we focused more on the marriage. And Eve's whining and complaining grated on my nerves.<br />I would not recommend this book to any bride to be. It would only depress her. Yes, the socks on the floor may be forever, but hey, there are more things to focus on in marriages than those little things. Too bad Eve and Michael weren't soulmates as I had hoped. They just seem like they were thrown together and figured, hey, let's get married and have this wonderful wedding. Michael even said in the book to allay Eve's fears, \\"First sweetie, we have to get married before we can get a divorce.\\" If this is glib and funny, I shudder to see how the other parts in the book can be construed as funny!!<br />2-15-02	2002-02-15

Jarman points out that not all is cake and jewelry for royals, especially for royal princesses who later become queens. This book is about Katherine, Henry V's bride, who later spawned the Tudor dynasty. This book takes Katherine through her rough and lonely childhood. She is the daughter of a mad king of France and a perverted queen, always caught in the middle of the tug-of-war between her parents. Then it details her marriage to the king of England who comes over to reclaim England's ancient claims on lands in France. Then after the king died and while as queen mother of Henry VI, she finds love again with Owen Tydier, later named as Owen Tudor. <br />What a fanastic read through the cobblestones of historical reading! It just makes me want to read more on English and French royalty. I would definitely hate to be a royal ~~ it's not easy as it sounds. But hey, it's like a glimpse into the past and one can dream, right? <br />I recommend this book highly! I hope that you'll be able to find a copy of this book. It's one that is full of surprises and you can't help yourself reading it all in just a few days. <br />2-15-02	2002-02-15

Books	5	14	16	N	N	This is a book that I need	I found this in a bookstore ... where it was the only book on twins anywhere in my hometown. It's a fascinating read and helps ease the jitters in this new mom-to-be!! It's very helpful and with week-by-week guides to your symptoms as you go through pregnancy. For example, did you know that when you're carrying twins, the hormones are raging twice as hard than in mothers carrying just one baby ... and that morning sickness may continue throughout the whole pregnancy.<br />I am so glad that I found this book ~~ it's one I keep in the bathroom whenever I need a tibit of advice or encouragement!<br />2-15-02	2002-02-15

If you like to read books on relationships between mother and daughter and sisters, this is a good book to pick up. There is Margaret, the mother who has discovered new-found freedom at the age of 48 (which is very young!), her two daughters, Daisy and Dale. Daisy, pregnant with her third child, goes through a divorce that literally shakes her world upside down. Dale, in the throes of first true love, makes a tenative step into making a committment ... though she is afraid that her mother and sister's divorces may cause her to go down the same stumbling road later on in life. <br />It is a wonderfully written book full of insightful thoughts and discoveries. Margaret discovers that she could no longer be like the woman she was in Liberty, Iowa, where she dispensed free advice along with cookies and milk. Now, she's preserving the self she has disovered in the year since her divorce and move to Vancouver, Canada. She really embodies the joy and freedom of being one's own self, not responsible to any one else. It's a grand feeling ... it's something that I've discovered through my own divorce. The only difference is, Margaret feels no need to get married again, whereas I did get married.<br />Daisy is the one character that has come a long ways since the beginning of the book. Her trials and tribulations as a young and single mother are too vividly descriptive and true. But she comes through it and discovers a whole new personality that she didn't have before. She really gave new meaning to the word &quot;sacrifice.&quot; Out of all the characters, she is my favorite.<br />Dale ~~ she is in the midst of the passionate throes of true love and at the same time, she's afraid to make a committment to her lover, Hank, because she's afraid she's doomed to repeat her mother and sister's mistake. Then she realizes that letting go of her fearand stepping through the changes in life really enhances her love.<br />This is an unique book ~~ one for mothers and daughters to share. I enjoyed it though it wasn't what I quite expected. However, I read it and wouldn't put it down till the last page was turned. I don't think others will regret reading it too.<br />2-15-02	2002-02-15

I have read three of Lisa's other books and this one didn't disappoint me at all. She kept me guessing all throughout the book on the identity of the \\"real\\" murderer in the book. Whoo hoo. I love a good guessing game ... and guess what? She doesn't reveal it on the last page either ... so if you're like me and skip to read the last page ~~ the secret isn't out of the bag!<br />Danny, the sheriff's son was found by Rainie, the local deputy, holding two smoking guns in his hands. There were two girls ~ best friends since childhood laid dead a few feet away. And the computer teacher was also dead ... and Danny soon became one of those caught up in the school shootings that has been in the news recently. Only things didn't appear like they should ... and Rainie races to catch the real murderer before anyone else gets hurt. While working on this case, she also comes to grips with her ulgy past.<br />It's a wonderful read ... just don't read it at night alone in a big house. I made that mistake one night while I was home. You get nervous at every creak in the house. And Lisa does it again ... she grips you with her fascinating attention to details and to the story ... keeps you guessing till the end. What a read!!<br />2-11-02	2002-02-11

I know the blurb doesn't sound like much ... An African-American woman diagnosed with HIV goes home to visit big sister. Boy, do I have to tell you ... ignore the blurb and just dive into the book. This is one of the best reads I've read this year. It's not depressing at all ... it's the fighting spirit book that just keeps you upbeat. I remember telling my husband about this book and now, he's interested in reading it someday (after my mom reads it!). <br />Ava Johnson comes home to Michigan after living in Atlanta for 10 years or so ~~ this was just going to be a short stop on the way to San Francisco where she is determined to find a new life. Only, that plan falls to the wayside. Ava's older sister, Joyce is a warm-hearted woman struggling to find ways to educate young African-American girls about birth control, fight against her church's narrow-minded pastor and his wife who are out to stop anything that is not \\"Christian-like\\". And along the way, they rescue a crack baby, Imani and Ava falls in love with Eddie, an old friend of Joyce and her husband. <br />This is such a rivetting read. One that I highly recommend to everyone. It is written with brutal truth and humor ... and you find yourself rooting for Ava and her family as they set out to conquer the small corner of their world. It's wonderfully written to keep your interest snared ... and I am looking forward to read more of this author's work. This is not your typical depressing Oprah pick ... it's one of the best, uplifting book I've read in a long time!!<br />2-11-02	2002-02-11

However, I really enjoyed reading it. Even told my husband to hush so I could finish reading it at the doctor's office today. =) It's very well-written and West takes right into the characters' minds so well, it's almost eerie.<br />The book is about Gussie, the mother and grandmother of the clan, Clancy Jane, Dorothy and Violet and Bitsy. Clancy Jane and Dorothy are sisters and Violet and Bitsy are their daughters. I have to be very truthful here ... I do not care for Dorothy at all. What a wretched woman ~~ beset by mental illness and jealousy. It's a shame that she was even in the book, but I guess every family has a skeleton in its closet. <br />And this family literally has a skeleton in its closet ... only it was buried out in the back yard. Gussie defended herself from rape and possible murder from one of the prominent family's sons ~~ who is also suspected of killing four other woman in Crystal Falls. And Gussie buried him half-alive. And is haunted by the rest of her life by the major secret that never fully came out. It only made me admire Gussie ... she shouldered on the burdens of raising a family and taking care of her husband after he returned from World War 11. <br />This is a fast read and one that I would recommend anyone to read. Just don't expect it to be a barrel of laughs as it wasn't that funny. I am a Yankee, so maybe the humor bypassed me completely! Oh well!!<br />2-11-02	2002-02-11

Being pregnant, Meg couldn't go on this journey ~~ but her baby brother Charles Wallace and the unicorn, Glaudior went on an adventure racing back in time to find out what had happened to Mad Dog's ancestors ... and perhaps stop the castrophe from happening.<br />It's a wonderful trip down history ~~ one that is just filled with historical notes and tidbits ... and visiting the planet where Glaudior is from ~~ is just pure romantic. This is a book that one couldn't just put down and forget.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone again ~~ one can never be too tired to sing L'Engle's praises when reading her books. She is an author that every one should read.

Ok, so it's not like her first book, \\"The Red Tent\\" ~~ but I didn't care as Diamant writes with her usual care and precision in telling a story. And I really enjoyed this book. I am not middle-aged yet, but I have always enjoyed reading a book that talks about friendship between two women. Having good friends of my own ~~ I really enjoy reading the friendship between Joyce and Kathleen. Joyce struggles with a marriage that seems to be heading for the rocks, a troubled relationship with her daughter and Kathleen struggles with her memories and guilt as she battles breast cancer. And when those two met ~~ they help each other heal. It's a wonderful journey through the pages watching how each of the woman grows into a delightful and more confident woman. It proves the old Biblical adage true ~~ one cannot walk through life alone. <br />I really enjoyed the different pace in the scenery. I love to take long walks and though I don't live near the ocean, whenever my girlfriends and I get together, sometimes our best conversations in life happens on a walk. There is something uplifting about walking with close friends ... and something totally relaxing. You can't hide confidents when you're relaxed. And I admire how Joyce and Kathleen would just call each other up and say, \\"Let's go for a walk.\\" And in those walks, they confide into each other that they wouldn't confide to their husbands. Just like women everywhere.<br />If you like to read books about friendship and loyalty ~~ this is a good read. Diamant won't disappoint you with her writing. And you'll be lulled by the soft voices of women talking by the sea.<br />1-23-02	2002-01-23

And was I in for a delightful surprise!<br />This is going to be among my favorite British book ... Jemima J. is a delightful, saucy and fun book to read. People say it's just a fanasty ~~ and that is the reason why I love it. Who cares if the story doesn't happen in real life? That is the stuff of dreams ~~ of which good fiction is made of! This book is it! <br />Jemima J. is an overweight girl who works a drudgery job at a newspaper in London. Food is her consolation while everyone around her is thin and happy. She also dreams of being thin and beautiful. Only she didn't think it was ever going to happen. A series of events propel her to a gym where she begins losing weight. Along the way, she discovers love and all the fun stuff that comes from being thin and glamourous. Only, she thinks maybe it's not all it is cracked up to be.<br />This is such a witty book that tugs at your heartstrings. You find yourself rooting for Jemima as she undergo a marvelous reformation as a person ~~ beautiful inside and out. This is way better than Mr. Maybe, Green's other novel that I have read. Maybe it's because the reader can relate to Jemima's insecurities and desires to be rich, famous and thin. Not all of us are like that and some of us harbor a secret desire to live that glamourous life and being lucky in love. <br />Jane Green outdid herself with this book. It is definitely a book I'll read again. It's also a book I'd loan to my friends who are still single ~~ they sure can relate to the dating woes in this book! If you're looking for a quick read in between all that Christmas shopping, wrapping presents, baking and whatnots, I highly recommend this one!

Teddy accidentally shoots his baby sister, Trina, and his whole life turns upside down as well as his mom and stepdad's. And Swick deals with the issue of grieving, bitterness, anger, a mother's struggle to continue to love her son ... all in this compact book. She deals with the death from all angles and does a good job. You relate to everyone of the characters and you see something that makes the evening news with a closer perspective than you would normally.<br />I enjoyed this book much to my surprise, considering the grisly theme. It also isn't just a cheap thriller either. It's a book I would pass on for friends to read. It's much better than I thought it would be and I recommend it for anyone to read.	2001-11-28

Even though I am not a part of that 30-something single crowd (I just got engaged recently) anymore, I can still relate to the trials and tribulations that Tara, Katherine and Finan go through as they struggle with issues of love, life and death. <br />I am a big Marian Keyes fan ~~ I have read just about every one of her books and she keeps writing better and better as time goes along. This is the newest U.S. release and it's wonderfully written ~~ with the English/Irish sass I have come to expect, and deeper characterization of her main characters.<br />Tara finds herself trapped in an unhappy relationship ~~ though she refuses to admit to herself what her friends are seeing ~~ that Thomas is a rat. Thomas criticizes Tara constantly about her weight, bills, and everything she does. The unhappier she gets, the more she eats and dives into her quest for the ultimate lipstick. However, Tara finally sees the light and the revelations she find strikes close to home in this reader's heart. <br />Katherine was jilted in affairs of the heart when she was young. With matching underwear sets and a pristine apartment, Katherine decides she is going to play it safe with her love life ~~ till Finan dares her to chase after the new guy in the office. Relucantly, she agrees and finds to her amazement new joy in a relationship with a man. <br />Marian writes so convincingly of her characters ~~ you, as a reader, feels as if you personally know each one of them. You're rooting for them as they undergo changes in their lives. And it's a small peek ~~ almost as if you're looking into their living room for a short period of time. It's a wonderful and quick read. <br />I wouldn't hesitate anyone to read this book. It is one of my favorites and I am eagerly awaiting other books that she hasn't released in the US yet. This book is also a great vacation read ~~ perfect for the beach or camping trip. It's light enough to keep your mind off of serious problems, and yet hefty enough to keepyou busy reading for a few days!	2001-11-19

I must confess I have read this book either in high school or junior high, but I barely remember it. After reading it again the second time, I have to say, that it is one of those books that every time you read it, it leaves with a greater impact on your soul. I plan to read this book again in 10 or 20 years just to see what new insights I can glean from this book.<br />The story is told from a young girl's eyes, as she witnesses some doings in Maycomb. Scout and her brother Jem are the town's lawyer's children. While growing up, they begin to discover why their father is really a gentleman, especially when he defends a black man accused of rape. That trial is not only felt throughout the town, but it affected Jem and Scout too in coloring their viewpoints of the world around them. <br />This is not your typical coming-of-age book. This is a book meant to provoke people to think and ponder on some of the issues she deals with in this book. It is a book I think every one should read ~~ regardless of their values and beliefs. I know that it is one book I plan to have my children to read as well as the nieces and nephews in my family. It is a book designed to get people to think and act ~~ not to live life passively.<br />It's a book for the classics. One for the ages ahead to read as well as those in the present too.	2001-11-19

I have never heard of John L'Heureux before, so this is a new venture for me to read. After I turned the last page, the conclusion I reached may not be exactly what the author intended, but it did provoke a reaction from me.<br />I would have rated this book 5 based on its superb writing prose and how he snares your attention while reading this book ... but the use of graphic details of the murder and sex scenes are just a little too much for me to take. I don't see how it adds to this book at all ~~ it only takes away the enjoyment I had while reading the suspense he was building up ... and it is a let down. It's as if he decided that his story wasn't enough to keep my interest, so he tries to &quot;jazz&quot; it up to keep my attention. It didn't work.<br />Otherwise, the story within a story did keep my attention and made me think ~~ which I love it when an author grabs me by my eyes and keep me ensnared in seeing their point of views.<br />Quinn, an inattentive husband to Claire, sets off a chain of events when he followed Sarah home from the store after she steals a handbag that he was thinking of buying for Claire. In turn, Quinn gets propositioned by Angelo, who is Sarah's bodyguard and her brother's lover. It is a soap opera of a sort ~~ ones that the gods of old surely love to tell. Based on Claire's, a professor of Euripides-studies, conversations with Angelo, you can tell that L'Heureux is attempting to tell the bloody story of Medea through Sarah and Claire. Quinn's decisions lead to the chaos that erupted violently on everyone's part. <br />This book is great for discussions. It is a book I would recommend a book group to read together because there are so many interpretations of this book and its ending. This is also a book that makes you want to brush up on your Greek tragedies and see what the gods had to say. It is a good read ~~ in spite of the gory details that I wish had been downplayed ~~ and something I wouldn't mind discussing with someone about.	2001-11-10

I knew that Patterson's books would always capture my interest  ~~ he is a suspenseful writer. And this one is no different.<br />Alex Cross is yet on another search, this time for The Mastermind, the scary mind behind all the murders during bank robberies, and Alex is jerked around by this criminal with the perfect plan. No one knows who he is ~~ and he can walk among them without anyone having a clue that he is this notorious murderer. Special Agent Betsey comes along and becomes Alex's partner in more ways than one while on this hunt for the Mastermind ~~ only to find that he is always one step ahead of them.<br />It's suspenseful enough to keep your interest in the book and now, you will have to read Violets are Blue to see what happens next ~~ a clever gimmick on Patterson's part to keep his readers interested and ensnared in his books. <br />I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this book ~~ especially if you're facing a long drive, commute or flight ~~ it sure makes the time go by faster because you're kept engrossed in this book. It's a fun read ~~ but be warned, there are some explicit scenes in this book that I wish he hadn't written about ~~ so skim over that if you have a queasy stomach like me! Otherwise, it's a fun book to read.	2001-11-10
1786348:US	49865122	R322KJ1XQTRL7Q	0517208601	633917650	Roots: The Saga of an American Family (Modern Classics)	Books	5	55	64	N	N	One of the best historical sagas written	I am surprised that I have not read this book sooner ~~ considering how much I love biography/family histories. This is one book that will definitely go on my top 50 books. <br />Alex Haley writes of his seven generations of family life ~~ beginning with &quot;The African&quot; ~ Kunta Kinte ~ who was abducted from his village in The Gambia and ending with a brief biography of himself. From a proud African captured and forced to become a slave to freedmen and farmers, business owners and the women who prayed for the families while keeping the stories alive ... this is one book to cherish. <br />You struggle with Kinte's disappointments, fears, sorrow, bitterness and joy as he watches his freedom disappears into slavery. You begin to understand his anguish at losing his family, self-respect, pride and honor. You begin to understand the stoicness behind each slave's demeanor as he or she serve their masters/mistresses and their secret longings for a home they can call theirs or even live their lives without fear of being sold off to another family plantation. And you begin to understand their relief when the Civil War ended.<br />I have to confess, Haley's family are among the fortunate ~~ they managed to stay together through two slave-holding families ~~ though I don't understand how the Murray family can say slavery is ok. They may be more lenient than other slaveholding families ~~ but it is still wrong to hold another human being against their will simply because of their skin color.<br />Haley demonstrates how the intelligence of his family helped them survive the years during slavery, after Civil War and during the Reconstruction period. And I have to confess, my favorite scene in this whole book is when Tom, shortly after being freed, comes upon a white man who had whipped him after accusing him of stealing food while working for him during the war, gives him a drink. The captain then demanded that Tom gives him a drink and Tom just looks at him steadily before walking away. He knew then that he was free and unbeholden to any white man. And Tom is my favorite character ~~ he finds a way to work around working for white men and still retaining his independence. He has the strength of The African running in his veins.<br />This is one book that will be sticking with me for a long time. It is rich in heritage. It is rich in dialect. It is rich in every human emotion possible, and dreams. It is rich in hope as well. This is one book that should be deemed as a classic ~~ it portrays American history in a way that we don't get to hear in classes in school. It is one dimension of a time that seeps in history ~~ and it is an African-American history. It is one that I highly recommend for everyone to read. The voices of Haley's ancestors aren't so easily forgotten. They will haunt you the next time you hear of a Civil Rights movement happening ~~ or a story about a slave ancestor. These are a people who have not forgotten their roots and where they came from. They hung onto their dreams and dignity as best as they could throughout some of the harshest times in the matters of history. And Haley captures their voices beautifully. <br />This is one book you won't regret picking up.	2001-11-02

And the story takes off from there, with parents whom she suspects are swingers in their &quot;old age,&quot; an ex-husband who left her for another man, a son who is wildly in love with Barbra Streisland, a comedy competition that soured because someone stole her material .... and falling in love with Matt. It is an entertaining love story ... one that will linger in your mind after reading it.<br />Sue Margolis is known for her racy books injected with British humor, and this book doesn't disappoint!! I can't wait to read more of her books!! She is one British author I am keeping on the top of my list. If it's a gray and rainy day outside, then I'll be sure to pick up one of her books ~~ she's entertaining enough to keep the blahs away for a few hours!	2001-10-29

In the first page of this book, Betty Smith writes very gently and calmly of Francie Nolan, a pre-teenager just beginning to step out on the edge of adulthood. And Smith ties the book up neatly at the end as if she's giving a present to the reader ... which she is. This is one of the sweetest, most eloquently written books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. <br />Francie Nolan lives in Brooklyn with her brother Neely, mom Katie and dad Johnny. It is in the early 1900s where the book is set. The family is poor ~~ living almost on the edge of starvation. Francie has taken to reading like a duck takes to water ... once she discovered the joy of reading, she becomes a big bookworm. She is also a keen observer of life around her ~~ her thoughts are often witty and funny as she observes the strange behavior of her mother's sisters and their lives, the neighbors, her brother Neely, her mother and father's relationships with one another. Till Francie grows up to be this amazing woman set on the path of her destiny.<br />Betty Smith takes you along for a wonderful story-filled walk in Brooklyn in the early 20th century. She introduces the smells of old Brooklyn, the noise, the joys and sorrows of being in a poverty-stricken family ~~ the hopes and dreams of the immigrants that left the old country because there was nothing there for them. The hopes and dreams of the parents for their children to have better lives than they did ... falling in love with one another ...  the disappointments of being disappointed by life, the wonder of finding joy in anything new or rediscovering something old. Betty Smith has captured the nuances of life and shares a bit of her soul for us readers to find. <br />What I like most about this book is how much I can relate to Francie and her reading habits and her growing up years. She is full of insecurities and questions, loves to read and takes such joy in reading ... especially when she promised herself that she was going to read every book in the local library, starting from a to z. And Smith captures that longing perfectly, as if she has had the same dreams and desires when she was 11. <br />I can rave about this book forever, but it isn't as much fun as reading this book. This book deserves to be read by everyone who has such joy in reading. This book deserves to be given to young girls on the verge of adulthood and encouraged to be read ... discussed. The love of reading is what all of us here have in common, and reading about it just encourages you to read more! <br />I urge you to buy this book and read it. It's worth every minute and hour of your time. It's one of those rare treasures that won't leave you without leaving a small imprint on your heart. I can guarantee you will fall in love with Francie and her family ... they're just like every other family you know. Just different ... Francie is one character you love to love. Just like I love to read. Don't delay ... buy!	2001-10-27

It was an Oprah book and one of my goals in life is to read all the books on her list. However, when I read the excerpt of this book, I have to admit, I was a little disconcerted. I didn't want to read another depressing book. <br />But this book is more than just depressing. It is a thought-provoking book based on the African-American lifestyle down in Mississippi. Jefferson was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was falsely accused of murder and sentenced to death. Grant, a teacher at the plantation near Bayonne, was asked to talk to Jefferson during his last days. Because the prosecuting attorney said that Jefferson was a hog, Jefferson took it in mind that he is nothing more than a hog and should die like one. And Grant was sent to persuade him otherwise. Grant didn't go willing. Jefferson's godmother and Grant's aunt pleaded with Grant to help Jefferson die with dignity ~~ to walk &quot;like a man&quot; to his deathbed.<br />This is such an insightful look into African-American relations with one another and with the whites and the rest of the world. As Jefferson nears his death, Grant spends his time soul-searching for the meaning of life, and asking those deep questions of why it was ok for a jury of 12 white men say it was ok for one black man to die. It goes on with other questions and statements. It is a book that will make you stop and think just about what the author is trying to prevail to you, the reader. <br />This is one of the most interesting books I have read this year. I did have a problem getting into the story line, but once I got into it, the story itself grabbed me by the eyes and soul ~~ and I couldn't let go. It is still haunting me as I write this review. There is so much I want to discuss ~~ but one needs to read the book in order to know what I am talking about. And I can't give away the story either. So grab this book and learn a lesson that may change your whole perspective on things. If you can get through the first few chapters, you will be rewarded by this awesome book!	2001-10-18

So I ordered it to read on a cold wintery day. Only the flu befell me and this was the best book to read in bed ~~ it is easy read. If I had to pick a book in between naps, I would pick this one!<br />I have always been a fan of Southern fiction and this book has propelled itself to the top of the list. It's wonderfully saucy!!<br />The book is written from Caroline's point of view. She escapes Tall Pines to New York ~~ only to come home years later to her mother when in the midst of marital woes. Originally, she escaped from her home and mother because she viewed her mother as this selfish woman when her father died ~~ only to realize that her perceptions of her mother isn't what she thought she was. And she begins to painstakingly restore her relationship with her mother and brother on her journey of self-discovery. This book is a wonderful exploration of a mother-daughter relationship set in the lush low-country of South Carolina. <br />Frank writes with vivid descriptions of Tall Pines and it's proximity to the river ~~ and she injected humor throughout the whole book ~~ that even when you are crying, you are laughing too. It's a wonderful easy read and one that I would recommend for any mother with daughters to read. It may not be the best literary book in the world, but who cares? It's a book that allows you to escape for a short while into the characters' lives. And isn't that what a book is supposed to do once in awhile?	2001-10-18

And I have to confess, I was not disappointed by this book at all. It has enough mystery in it to keep me guessing and just a little romance to make me wish I was like the heroine and no gory details about any murder or anything. It is just a fascinating book to read especially while soaking in a hot bath.<br />Carmel March was found in the Marlines' garden at Commonwood House. And when tragedy struck the Commonwood House, Carmel was whisked away to Australia. It wasn't till when she came home to visit England again that she realized that the wrong man was hanged for the murder of the mistress of the Commonwood House. And she embarks on an eventful journey to discover the truth. <br />This is such an easy read and so delightful too. I snuck in my reading time in between unpacking boxes of books and I couldn't wait to read the next page ~~ so I would sneak off to read it! Holt does it again. I remember again why I was such a big fan of hers while growing up. And I would recommend her books to any mystery lover. She's one of the leading classic writers for the mystery world and you won't regret reading her books.	2001-09-27

And I have to say, she is a talented lady! She writes beautifully and cleanly as she did with her romance novels, maybe even better.<br />Laurant is the target of a stalker who threatened to kill her to her brother, Tom, a priest who heard the killer &quot;confess&quot; during a confession. Tom gets his best friend, Nick Buchanan from the FBI on the case to protect Laurant. And this is just the beginning of a fun novel with twists and turns of a murder case going awry. <br />It is a quick and easy read. Like her other novels, Julie Garwood keeps the reader enthralled to the last page ~~ keeping her on her toes while she's guessing who the murderer is. If you're looking for a quick weekend read, be sure to pick this one up after locking all the doors and leaving the lights on ~~ and be sure to tell the hubby and kids to go away so you can sink into her novel without any interruptions! It is just a perfect weekend read!	2001-09-27

I have to recommend this book. It is one of those novels where you take it to your favorite reading corner and with a cup of hot tea or coffee, you make yourself comfortable and lose yourself in this book. <br />Jud Connors is a successful writer who is found murdered in his cabin. His daughter, Abby, finds her world falling apart ~~ who would want her dad dead? After she recovers from the shock, she goes on a hunt for her dad's murderer ... only to realize that she is the murderer's next target as she stands to gain her father's inheritance. <br />This is Wilhem's newest novel but it's nothing like her other novels. It is suspenseful enough to keep you hooked to find out who the murderer is. And she leaves enough hints throughout the novel to point to the murderer. However, it is not a nail-biting suspense novel ~~ it's just enough to keep you immersed into the book until you get to the last page.<br />If you're looking for a book to get lost in for a few hours, I highly recommend this book. Wilhem doesn't disappoint you here as she writes with her usual flair for words and descriptions of scenery ~~ and draws you closer to the murderer's lair of deceits and lies.	2001-09-27

I almost didn't pick it up to read again because the going-backs to the past and heading into the future were making me dizzy ... till I got the hang of the story. And I couldn't put it down from then on. If I could, I would rate it a 10! It's that good!!<br />Patrick Delaney was facing the end of his life and began contemplating the past ~~ to revisit the memories of his buddies from World War One, especially Daniel, his best friend who was killed in the war. Daniel was one of the rare men who have found love with Julia and through her letters to Daniel, Patrick fell in love with her. By a chance meeting in Paris ten years after the war, Patrick and Julia meet and fall in love. Patrick was married at the time and had a child and the confusion, longings and desires he had felt were so heartrending that one can't help but feel his pain and sorrow with him. Years later when Patrick's marriage fell apart, he never married again as he was haunted by his love for Julia.<br />Hull writes so convincingly of the days of a man facing death, shut up in a nursing home; traveling down memory lane wishing he had done things differently and trying to find the purpose of his life so he doesn't feel he lived in vain. You are trapped in an old man's body with Patrick and you feel the young man inside bemoaning how fast time travels. One day he was a jaunty soldier on his way to France ~~ his jauntiness hiding his fears and loneliness. Then the next day, he's an old man dying alone.<br />This is the most beautifully written book I have ever read. It sounds depressing on the blurbs but I advise you to ignore that. It is really not depressing ~~ it does have its depressing moments ~~ but it is freeing too. When life slows almost to a stop, one begins to realize that the hustle-bustle of our daily lives really don't mean anything. Only love matters ~~ where you hold your loved ones close; the touch of a lover's hand on your arm as you talk; the love of a child who runs into your arms ... all give meaning to your existence. Hull writes beautifully and movingly of the love we all search for in our dreams and he carries you along with his beautiful vision.<br />This is the most incredible romantic book I have ever read. And it helps that it is also lyrical as you travel through the years with Patrick as he searches for his one love ~~ Julia. And while it sounds sappy, it's not. I highly recommend this book for anyone to read. It's a gem of a book to add to your book collection.	2001-09-27

She grows up in the family loved by her parents and brother ~~ till a Texan reporter contacts her to share with her the mystery of her past.

When I heard that Kathy was writing another book ~~ I couldn't wait to pick it up and read it since I really did enjoy The House of Gentle Men, her first novel. And I must say, this novel surpasses the first book. It's wonderfully written and you're hooked till the last page has been turned.<br />Alice, the main character in the story, finds her world turned upside down when her father left the house and her mother falls in love with Simon, the man who rescued her mom from drowning. There's Boone, her older brother, who is hopelessly in love with a infamous teen, Persley Snow, who has managed to escape the mental hospital several times. She was accused of killing her parents. And that's where the story becomes interesting!<br />Kathy writes with a flair ~~ you feel as if you're there with the characters running for their lives and fighting back. You feel their hopelessness as they realize that this is an adult's world after all. You feel their despair and shame. You feel Boone's agony as he struggles with accepting Simon as his stepfather and to forgive him. Then you feel him trying to control his temper ~~ and it's heartwrenching to read about those two kids and Persley trying to keep away from an abusive man. You feel Meg's (the kids' mother) neglect as she tried to protect her marriage. It goes on and on ~~ and you won't forget these characters after the last page has been turned.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.

It also explores the mindset of a killer and why he married Tess ~~ and why he chases after her after getting out of prison. It's a terrifying look inside an abuser's mind.  <br />If you're brave enough to read this, I dare you to. If you haven't read Lisa Gardner before, I highly recommend you reading this author. She is talented and will ensare you with her stories. It's a great spooky read and a perfect gift for that Halloween lover in you!	2001-09-09

This book was written mostly about the musical genius Gideon and his struggles in figuring out why he was blocked from playing his violin.<br />It starts out as a woman gets run over in a busy London street but it doesn't pick up till the police realize that Eugenie Davies was murdered ~~ she was hit by a car, then the car backed up and ran over her three times. And left her for dead. That is when Lynley and Havers enter the investigation. And George does her usual twists and turns with the suspects' till even the reader becomes convinced that the murderer isn't the murderer. And if you're like me ~~ if you peek at the last page, she doesn't give it away then either. <br />This is a superbly written murder mystery ~~ George takes you down the darkside of London's citylife and she explores the dark side of the human mind as well. She takes you down for a story only to realize that you've been living with someone's struggles in remembering what had really happened in the past and how it was connected with the murder today.<br />George once again is my favorite mystery writer. This book isn't as good as the others in the series, but it is still one of the best murder mysteries around. I just enjoy it and couldn't wait to read the ending. If you like her other books, you will like this one too. It's a fine book to add to your Elizabeth George collection.	2001-09-06

I gave it a 4 because it is a quick and good read ~~ and the writing is superb. But I keep finding myself asking what the point of the novel was. Rosie moves to Paris to live with a family on a boat, after she gives birth to a baby to give to her sister and husband ~~ who cannot have children. She didn't just move, she escaped from the pain of knowing that she wanted her baby more than anything and knowing that she can't have her baby. While in Paris, she becomes involved with her &quot;family&quot; ~~ and their lives. And falls in love with Nicole's husband, Marc. To escape from that love, she flees to a southern town in France ~~ where Nicole grew up in. The story begins with fleeing from her past and ends with acceptance ~~ Rosie finally finds a place where she feels she belongs. And finally finds acceptance with Nicole, the one woman who Rosie didn't care for. The two women were a lot more alike than Rosie realized ~~ and the story revolves around those two characters. It is a pleasant read ~~ and King takes you on a descriptive tour of France and Spain ~~ I almost see where Rosie was going. If you have the wanderlust in you, this book will be a great tease to your senses ~~ and while it won't satisfy your longings, it will calm it for a short while. If you like reading about other cultures, this book is a short introduction to the French culture. This is not my favorite read of the year, but it will do sufficently for a short period of time when all I want to do is read and escape from the reality pressing in. It does carry you away into a different world and, isn't it always more fun to read about someone else's problems? This book did the trick for me!	2001-08-28

It is superby written and translated very well ~~ I enjoyed Hoeg's descriptions of snow, ice and the studies of glaciers. I was left reaching for my blankets at night whenever I picked up this book ~~ it's so cold and so impersonal in the Artic! Smilla's neighbor Isiah was found in the snow dead. And Smilla thought there was something fishy about his death ~~ for one thing, the boy was terrified of heights. And there were other clues as well ~~ that lead Smilla on a terrifying chase for the truth. She didn't intend to play detective ~~ but she didn't trust the police in Denmark either, especially since Isiah was a Greenlander. I must say, if you need to read this book, read it on a hot, sweltering day. Don't read it in the wintertime as you'll never look at snow the same way! And I would recommend this book as a good mystery read ~~ but it's not your typical mystery either. It goes much further than that ~~ combine a good story with a good mystery and good writing ~~ you have a book that is enjoyable in every way!!	2001-08-27

This is another quick read for me ~~ and keeping track of all the characters wasn't difficult at all. The book flows entirely on its own, like champagne. Some people like champagne and others don't ~~ and so will they with this book. It's really an insightful and thoughtful read into relationships and marriages. <br />April suddenly announces that she is marrying her boyfriend of three months and her family is left wondering why she ditched her steady and reliable boyfriend of years ~~ though the reasons were highlighted in flashbacks ~~ even Barney was wondering why he was dumped. There are other marital stories as well ~~ interspersed with incidents happening in suite 33 in the hotel. (The hotel was once a raunchy roadhouse and rumor has it that there was a murdered woman haunting the place.) While April and Caleb begin their married lives together, another marriage was ending in Room 33. And the stories begin.<br />It is such a fun read ~~ dark in some places, light in others, hilarious in some takes and romantic in others. It is also well-written and easy to read. I couldn't wait to finish the book to see how it all ended. The characters spoke for themselves throughout this book with their stories ~~ stories that everyone like us can relate to. Marriage is not easy and those characters provide a glimpse into their lives and marriages to show why that particular thing we all long for ~~ are sometimes so unattainable. <br />I highly recommend this book. It is one of the top 100 reads on my list!!	2001-08-20

When I read out excerpts of this book to my boyfriend, he laughed over it. It is such a dishy read!<br />Libby is an aspiring woman who dreams of living in a fancy house, wearing designer duds, lunching at the coolest places in London, wining and dining, hobnobbing with the rich and famous ~~ but in her job as a public relations gal, it doesn't seem likely that her dreams would come true. Till she meets Ed, a successful financial investor ~~ and shows her a glimpse of the enticing world she has always dreamed of. Only to get cold feet as the day to start shopping for an engagement ring nears. Also, she cannot forget Nick, the last boyfriend she had before Ed ~~ the guy who is just perfect for her.<br />This book is hilarious in some takes and a fast read. I highly recommend taking this book to the beach (or a camping trip like I did) and prepare for a fun afternoon enjoying a light-hearted read!!	2001-08-14

And their love story takes you from the top of a Manhattan rooftop to the farmland in Vermont. There are murder, intrigue and steamy sex scenes written in this little book. <br />If you're looking for something to read while taking a break from house cleaning, painting or any of those tiresome chores, this book is one I would recommend. It's not the deepest read of the year, but it is fun!	2001-08-07

The only other book I've ever read by Michael Ondaatje is &quot;The English Patient&quot; and I really love that book too. This book is superbly written ~~ with Anil's past, present and future all interacting with the civil war happening in Sri Lanka. Anil leaves home at the age of 18 and returns years later to a different country than she had left and she tries to reconcile the two separate countries with one another only to leave in confusion.<br />Anil is an forensic anthropologist sent by an international human rights group to discover the source of the organized campaigns of murder engulfing Sri Lanka. She meets up with Sarath, her partner and his brother Gamini who is a surgeon who really sees the carnage of war. And in her search for truth, Anil embarks on a path of self-discovery along the way. <br />This is a beautifully written book ~~ very lyrical and lush. It isn't your typical fast-paced novel ~~ then again, life in the tropics aren't fast-paced except maybe in war. Ondaatje takes his time in developing the plot of the novel as he seems to want the reader to slow down and drink in the words he is putting forth about this island and its troubles. And you won't have trouble following along with Anil's story which is also interwined with other stories. Ondaatje keeps the same thread of idea with every one of the stories and ties them up neatly at the end. <br />I really enjoyed &quot;The English Patient&quot; and this book is just as good. Ondaatje is definitely a writer to keep an eye out for. He should be considered a classic writer ~~ he writes with a beautiful pen and brings the story with a subtle closure. His books aren't fast-paced as he wants you to think about what he is writing, especially when a person comes home and realizes that &quot;you can't come home again.&quot; He explores the relationships between people, brothers, lovers and friends. You know where he's coming from because you've experienced it.<br />This is a definite keeper in anyone's library. Don't wait to pick this book up ~~ read it now and be entranced by Ondaatje's words of beauty and sorrow.	2001-08-01

You cannot imagine your life without these essential women in your life ~~ and this book will only enrich your reading life because these four women are like us.<br />Emma, Rudy, Lee and Isabel are sisters of the heart and soul ~~ they've been through it all ~~ cancer, divorce, adultery ~~ and they talk through everything. They have relationships with each other that only women with close friends can only understand ~~ and others envy. In this book, they're put to the test when something unimaginable happens ~~ and Graffney shows how each of them survive this crucial test. <br />It's not a secret that I enjoy reading books on women's friendships and relationships with one another ~~ because I am fortunate enough to have close friends to rely on during my dark times recently. This is one book that I really appreciate because it is about friendship, love and courage. Rudy, Emma, Lee and Isabel are not easily forgotten ~~ I have friends who are like them. <br />But here's a warning ~~ you must have a box of kleenexs handy ~~ it is a tearjerker ~~ and don't read parts of it in public ~~ Graffney really tugs at your heartstrings. And when you've finished this book, be sure to pass it onto your best friend and tell her just how important she is to you.	2001-07-25

And it is one of the best summer reads this summer. I read it in a day and a half. It's that good!!<br />We women all understand that we have different relationships with our mothers and daughters ~~ and while I am extremely close to my mother now, I wasn't always so. And this book is a refreshing look into those complex relationships we all share with the most important women in our lives.<br />Carrie, her daughter Ruth and Carrie's mother, Dana were thrown into a life change when Carrie's husband, Ruth's dad died suddenly. And Graffney explores what happens between mother/daughter during a grieving period. Carrie struggles with guilt that she didn't love her husband like she should have. Ruth struggles with the realization that she never really knew her father and she misses the father she thought she had. And Dana comes to several realizations about her marriage and her relationship with Carrie, especially after Carrie falls back in love with her high school sweetheart. All three of them come to painful conclusions about themselves and matured in the process.<br />Every woman needs to pick up this book. I highly recommend it for book clubs. It is well-written, thought-provoking, hilarious in some parts and bittersweet. We all can relate to each of those characters ~~ because at one time, we all were at Ruth's age ~~ trying to figure out what the adult world is really like; and we've all remember our first loves and regrets; and some of us know what it is like to face our mortality and regrets over a long period of life. It is one of the rare insights into women's lives and thoughts. <br />Now that I've read it, I am passing it onto my mother to read. I'm sure she'll find pieces of herself in this book like I did. It is a book worth reading and savoring. It is also a quick read ~~ you can't help but be drawn to the characters and relate to what they're going through. And you won't forget Ruth, Carrie and Dana. You can't. They're around you every day.	2001-07-25

It's fascinating glimpse into the Indian lifestyle as well as women's minds and emotions as they enter a program designed to create peace between the Indians and the U.S. nation. <br />Little Wolf, the chief of the Cheyenne nation brokers a little-known deal with President Grant about having 1,000 white brides for the Indians to marry and they would raise the children between the races. And Grant accepted the agreement ~~ and this is where May Dodd comes in. She keeps an one-person journal of her and her friends' adventures while in the tribe.<br />And while sometimes the book drags in certain parts, it is a very interesting view point of the Indian culture and the American West before it was settled. You will find yourself relating to all the women ~~ women should read this book ~~ because if you're interested in reading about strong women, this book is it. It's just purely fascinating and interesting!!<br />It is a book you'll want to read again. So grab it and put it in your personal library. I don't think you'll regret it.	2001-07-21

And they were right. Normally, I don't read such sappy stories as it is predictable, but I must confess this book isn't predictable and it's really one of the sweetest books I've read in a long time. <br />The Lighthouse Keeper isn't about just about lighthouses ~~ it is about two men and a woman keeping in touch with their heritage and learning life's tough lessons along the way. Uncle Bill came to Port Hope after a tragedy happened to him and he found renewed hope and joy in life again. Peter, his nephew, comes home from WWII to carry on the tradition that his uncle has started ~~ by keeping the light on for other weary sailers in the world. And Kathleen, Peter's daughter is the silent observer with her own glimpses into her family's heritage. And Pratt combines the two men's stories into one. <br />This novel is not normally what I would choose to read because I am spoiled by lyrical writing and thought-provoking novels ~~ but I am glad that I managed to pick this book up. It is one of the most uplifting novels I have read so far this year. It provides a glimmer of life and hope after tragedies abound in one's life. And it leaves you with a warm glow after the last page is turned.<br />If you like Pratt's &quot;The Last Valentine,&quot; then you will like this book. It's one of the sentimental and uplifting book with a moral ~~ never let life's woes keep you down. It's also a quick read and a thoroughly enjoyable one as well. This is one I would recommend to others!	2001-07-21

It is also an unexpected surprise to read something based on a foreign culture and totally relate to the characters. And &quot;Waiting&quot; is an apt title for this book ~~ probably the best title for any book I've ever read as it matches closely the story.<br />Lin Kong, a doctor in the Chinese army returns to his village every summer to end his loveless arranged marriage with his wife, loyal Shuyu, only it fails. Lin wants to marry Manna Wu, a nurse in the same hospital he works at. Lin is caught between two different women and trapped by a culture in which adultery can ruin lives and careers. And when the divorce is granted, much to Lin's surprise, he's in for an interesting journey through self-discovery and love.<br />I have found myself becoming impatient with each of the characters at one time or another ~~ but mostly with Lin because he just couldn't seem to make up his mind about anything. Then I would get impatient with Manna ~~ why doesn't she leave Lin and find happiness on her own? Or with Shuyu, why doesn't she let go? And the answers that come along are very interesting and revealing. I promise this is a good read ~~ and the descriptions of some of their food are just mouth-watering. <br />Ha Jin writes a very intimate and revealing book, one that explores the definition of what love is and how love between a man and a woman, wife and husband, father and child affect everyone around them. Jin writes thoroughly of the Chinese Culture and how the Revolution changes the way of people's mindset ~~ and how the rural folks resist the change. <br />This is a definite book I would recommend to anyone and everyone who even has a slight interest in Chinese culture. I am not even surprised that it has won a National Book Award ~~ it is that well-written. And Lin will linger in your mind for hours after you've put the book down. His conflicts and confusions are just the same as anyone else's when they confront what love is.	2001-06-29

Don't get me wrong, DuBois' writing is terrific and the book is well-written ~~ but it seemed to have dragged me along in a couple of chapters as I anxiously await to read what the reporter Carl Landry is on the hunt for. And some of the characters are predictable ~~ much to my chagrin. But if you're looking for a really good &quot;what if&quot; book, this is it. <br />I was born way after the Bay of Pigs incident and the Kennedys I know of are the ones I read about ~~ John John and Caroline. Oh yes, Senator Ted Kennedy. So, when I picked up this book, I thought, oh cool, a history lesson mixed in with fiction. Well, DuBois didn't really go into the history part as much as he writes about what if the Russians did bomb us and we bombed the Russians, and how would our lives be? That part is terrifying ~~ I cannot imagine living in a police state nor can I imagine losing everything and everyone in a nuclear blast. And DuBois plays well with your emotions and fears as he writes about Carl Landry on a mad hunt for the truth.<br />Landry is joined by a British reporter, Sandy who has secrets of her own. And together, they tried to find out what had really happened that fateful day World War III had broken out. And the military is hot on their tail ~~ they didn't want Landry to find out the the truth. It makes for a good reading. <br />Just because I didn't think it was suspenseful enough for me (No one can be like Patterson or some of those other writers), it is still a good book to pick up. In fact, I am planning to pass this onto my friends and family and see what they think of it. I am sure my parents would enjoy it better as they had lived through the Kennedy times ~~ and still remember those drills in case of a nuclear attack.<br />If you're looking for a fiction that has plenty of action and dialogue, then this is it. If you expect it to be more historical, this isn't it. Still a good read though.	2001-06-29

And now, I highly recommend everyone to buy this book ~~ or at least read it as it is an example of America's finest writings for this century.<br />Baxter takes the stories of several people in his insomniac journey and gives them life in the passage of love. There is Bradley, the main character, who is unlucky in his choice of wives ~~ Kathryn who leaves Bradley for love of another woman and Diana, whose cold, secretive nature makes her more suitable as a mistress than as a spouse. There is Chloe and Oscar, employees of Bradley's coffee shop ~~ whose love for one another and dreams of love are more traditional than their multiple piercings and tatoos. There are Harry and Esther, Bradley's neighbors, whose love for their son persists in spite of his hatred for his parents. And Baxter weaves their tales among Bradley's quest for conjual happiness in life.<br />It is well-written, witty and charming. It is also humorous as well. It is such a fun book to read ~~ with all the characters' voices in harmony. <br />I don't think anyone who reads this book will regret this choice ~~ and I've read many books in the last year. This book will not only be passed onto others ~~ it will serve as a conversational piece among lovers and friends ~~ who all share different points of views on love. It will leave the reader with a good feeling too ~~ more optimistic and hopeful than when one starts this book. <br />This is my first Baxter book and I want to read his others ~~ anyone who can write like he does deserves lots of space in my personal library.	2001-06-19

Now that you have this warning, don't hesitate to buy this book. It is a book about friendships, first loves and hope. <br />Sam Thibodeau returns with his wife and veterinary partner, Lydia Newhart, and embarks on a new chapter in his life. Dee Dee, his oldest friend and first true love returns home with her son, Trooper, Sam revisits old memories and forgotten dreams. Dee Dee not only comes home, she comes home with a secret ~~ and Sam and Lydia become involved with Dee Dee and Trooper. Dee Dee gets involved with candle-making (with those delicious quotes about candles interspersed throughout the book ~~ this book is a booklover's dream!) and renews old friendships along the way. <br />It didn't take me long to read this book ~~ as it is a slim book and it is one that just grabs your attention by the eyes and you won't be able to put it down. Don't pick it up if you have lots of weekend plans ~~ I can guarantee you that your stuff won't get done till you finish this book.

It doesn't help when you have a hectic social life, but when I had the time to read, it just doesn't grab my attention till about three-fourths of the way into the book ... then, I really started enjoying it.<br />Lily Wilk is an artist ~~ but she just couldn't seem to reach for the dream where she can create something specatular ~~ until a rich businesswoman commissioned her to create a portrait of her family. During the painting of the family, Lily walks through memory lane and shares her stories about her own family with the readers. Shea ties up both families' histories with a neat little bow and gives Lily a new perspective on what she really wanted out of life. <br />It is a great book for a long, lazy day swinging on the hammock ~~ just don't give up early on. I promise that it does get better after awhile. And when you put it down, it'll remain in your heart ~~ and perhaps give you a new appreciation for your family.	2001-06-14

It is sassy ~~ but also depressing. It does start out slow, but after awhile, you really get into the book. The names are even hilarious and the love stories are bittersweet. <br />Darla Moon is the child of a semi-retired hooker mother, raised on the leavenings of welfare, and she dreams big dreams of moving to New York to become a designer, only her ties to her family remain too strong for her to leave with a light heart. There's Spirit, the minister who falls in love with her; Rhonda, her sister who is married to a classic drunk who beats her; Elijah, the father-figure in her life; Granny, who has lost quite a few marbles in her head ~~ but remains one of the sweetest and central persons in Darla's life. There are the kids, Jessie and Pearl, Rhonda's kids, who are the loves of Darla's life. And there is Bingo ~~ every week, twice a week, bingo playing is the main central thing in their lives. As Darla prepares to move on with her life, all sorts of things happen to keep her rooted to her roots. Till she discovers the freedom of being her own person.<br />If you're looking for a heavier reading, I would not recommend this book. If you're looking for a lighter, bittersweet book to read while on car trips, or heading to the beach, then I would suggest that you pick this book up. It is depressing in some places ~~ life is too real to really be comfortable with this book as an escapism. But it is a book that you won't quickly forget.	2001-06-13

After getting into the book, I realized that it was on two different themes ~~ one on &quot;mercy killing&quot; and the other on &quot;betrayal.&quot; <br />Jamie MacDonald's wife was suffering from cancer and he killed her because he claimed that she had asked him to. Cam MacDonald is his cousin who is also the police chief of a Scottish town rich in heritage. Allie is Cam's wife who helps Jamie in his search for justice. And we can't forget Mia, who isn't a central character in this book ~~ but her actions turn Cam and Allie's lives upside down. <br />Picoult does a thorough job of researching all sides of the euthanisia issue and its lingering after-effects. And she draws her characters with vivid words and actions ~~ the courtroom scene was tense and suspenseful. It is a well-written book ~~ one that I couldn't put down.<br />But there is also another theme that Picoult explored here in this book ~~ betrayal. Jamie was betrayed by Maggie who asked him to kill her because the cancer was so bad. In doing that, Jamie is scarred for life simply because by his own hands, he killed the best thing that has ever happened to him. And he is full of grief that he doesn't have the courage to join her in death either. If Maggie was brave and selfless, she could have taken a bunch of pills to die instead of asking her husband ~~ a man who would do anything for her because of the depth of his love ~~ to kill her. What an incredibly selfish act.<br />And don't forget Allie. She was betrayed by Cam and Mia ~~ the two characters you would love to look down upon because of their immaturity and selfishness. Allie comes into her own person throughout Jamie's trial and that changed everything in the MacDonald's marriage. <br />Please don't hesitate to pick up this book. It's great and an engrossing read. It is one of her better books in her collection. The characters will linger with you for a while after reading this book. So will the issue of &quot;mercy killing.&quot; It is something that society needs to explore more on.	2001-05-30

Helen is a free-lance writer who is asked to write about Maggie Fox, one of the Spiritualist leaders in the 19th century. The two women's stories parallel one another and sometimes become entwined. <br />Helen is still coming to terms with the death of her lover who died tragically in Rome when she starts the research on Maggie. And throughout the telling of Maggie's story, Helen tells her story as well. And it is a fascinating insight into the grieving process. For some of us, it takes longer to get over the death of a lover than it does for some others. Helen was plagued with insomnia, the &quot;knocking&quot; sound that entered her house, watching her friends move on with their lives and the third-year anniversary of her lover's death coming up ~~ it was beginning to be too much. Also, the story was set in the deepest and most bitterest of winters as well ~~ like a frozen life slowly coming to a thaw. <br />It is an interesting read. It may not be one of my most favorite books in the world, but I've gained a new insight to what the Spiritualist movement really was to the Victorians. And I've gained an insight that not all is lost when a lover dies ~~ life still moves on. It is a haunting tale and one that you cannot put down easily ~~ but it's one that you're glad to have read.	2001-05-28

I have always loved &quot;The Eight Cousins&quot; and when I found out about this one ~~ I was a kid then ~~ I fell in love with Rose and her cousins even more. Now that I am an adult, I still love this book.<br />Rose isn't a sickly child anymore and she's on the threshold of becoming a fine woman ~~ and two of her cousins were in love with her. This book talks about her journey into adulthood and the dilemma she faced in choosing her husband ~~ and it's a wonderfully written book.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone who has read &quot;The Little Women&quot; or even &quot;The Eight Cousins&quot; as Alcott's writing style is timeless. This is a classic book that I bought for my own children to read. This should be in everyone's library.	2001-05-23

It's not badly written, nor was it boring ~~ it just didn't capture my interest like her recent books did. I am a speed reader and a book of this size normally would take me two days to read ~~ but it has taken me over two weeks to read. So beware when you pick up this book ~~ it's not the book you've come to expect from Picoult.<br />Jane and Rebecca Jones leave husband/dad Oliver, a world-known marine biologist behind and traveled the country to visit Jane's brother Joley. In the novel, five people offer up their versions of what happened one fateful summer. There's Joley, Sam ~~ who owns the apple orchard that Joley works at and where Rebecca and Jane find refuge in, Rebecca, Jane and Oliver. They all offer up their voices as if they wanted to leave their impressions on the reader. And it is very well-written ~~ especially for a first book. One can almost smell the apples growing, feel the hot sting of the summer sun beating down upon you, the despair and anger Oliver felt when he realized his family deserted him. Or the heartache Rebecca experiences when her first boyfriend died in a tragic fall. The stories just tumble out from each of them and you don't want to rush your way reading through it. It is murky in some places ~~ but isn't that how life is supposed to be sometimes? Sometimes, we can't figure out the path we're on or where we are supposed to be ~~ but there comes a moment where you can seize the moment. <br />If you're a die-hard Picoult fan, then I highly recommend you try to read this book. I have a suspsicion that not all of us are going to come to the same conclusion with this book. But it is interesting and well-written. I may have to struggle with finishing it, I did and am glad that I finished it. It is Picoult's debut novel and you can see the beginnings of a long literary career that started with this book. Enjoy.	2001-05-23

It talks about date rape/acquaintance rape ~~ a subject that isn't talked about very often ~~ and you will find resources in this book to help a survivor recover ~~ or even to prevent a rape from happening. And I recommend young men reading this book too. It shows the other side of rape ~~ a man may think that a woman &quot;teased&quot; him and that she really wanted it ~~ but oftentimes, it leaves lasting scars ~~ not just on the victims but also on the rapists too. Both men and women need to be educated on what date rape is ~~ it is more common than people think. <br />When a woman says no, a man is trained by society that she really means yes ~~ but that isn't the case. Rape is when a sexual act is committed against a woman's will ~~ even if she knows her attacker. It's downright disturbing and there are many women who have survived date rape. Did you know that &quot;stranger rape&quot; occurs very rarely but &quot;acquaintance rape&quot; occurs more often? Also, did you know that even if a woman stops dating a man, he can still rape her? There are all kinds of stories in this book that the author shares with the reader to warn them of this issue.<br />This book will share with you how to recognize the danger signals and how to prevent a rape from happening. If it happens, there is advice on what to do next. It explores the statistics of numerous studies performed on this topic and it's downright scary. But there are people fighting it and so can you. Just read this book, and pass it on. I truly believe every woman going off to college or moving out on her own or even entering her teen years should have a copy of this. It shouldn't be a topic to ignore ~~ it should be talked about and shared ~~ it is a serious issue and one that every woman needs to be aware of.<br />I have a young cousin going off to college and this is one book I would like to send to her. For all you moms, dads, grandmas, aunts, sisters, cousins, friends should think of the young women (and young men) in your family or circle of friends and think of how you should arm them with knowledge on how to prevent acquaintance rape from happening. But not only women need to read this book, men should too. They should sit down with their sons and tell them that &quot;no means no.&quot; And that they should resist pressure from other men in raping a woman. Acquaintance rape is very damaging to women and to men as well. It wreaks havoc on the fragile fabric of society itself. <br />Pick it up ~~ I don't think you'll regret it as one can never have too much information about a topic like this one.	2001-05-19

A very good friend of mine gave it to me to celebrate my divorce and I waited till I underwent one of the most humilating experiences in my life to read this book. And I was relieved to know that I am on the right track ~~ Jim Smoke has excellent advice for people who are going through divorce as well as uplifting little verses to help you to retain your focus back on God. <br />My favorite quote is from Ernest Hemingway and he said, &quot;Life breaks us all sometimes, but some grow strong at the broken places.&quot; And it is so true ~~ only if we take Smoke's advice to heart. These are not the heavy-duty tome advice ~~ but just little inspirational tidbits to tide you through the day. And it's something that you can read over and over again ~~ especially in the bleakest hours. <br />I highly recommend this gem to anyone who is undergoing a divorce and if you know someone who is facing that trial of the year/lifetime, please do what my friend did. Grab a bunch of little inspirational stuff (in my case, it was a memo pad with the sunflower and an inspirational quote, as well as two magnets) and this book. It will brighten up your friend's day and give her/him the extra courage to face the ending of a relationship as she/he knows it. Believe me, it will help give one courage to face the unknown future of being single again.	2001-05-16

I love Jodie Picoult's writing, and was eagerly anticipating more of the same with this book. I found to my disappointment that it wasn't as riveting as The Pact or as enthralling as Keeping Faith. I am disappointed ~~ while the writing is always lyrical and riveting, the story holds no surprises for me.<br />Jack St. Bride is accused of raping a girl in Salem Falls ~~ and Jordan MacAffee is his attorney again. Addie, the woman who falls in love with Jack, also undergo a personal revelation as well in this multi-faceted novel. There is a group of teenage girls who practice Wicca ~~ which is interesting. And there's the showdown, which Picoult is known for ~~ but if you're looking for a great Picoult book, I highly recommend The Pact because the courtroom scene there is wonderful! It is suspenseful and breath-stopping. But in this book, it's lackluster and disappointing.<br />Please don't hesitate to read this book ~~ it is still a good read. It just isn't up to par to her other books ~~ and it could be the subject is familiar to me. What teenage girl doesn't fanastize about her favorite male teacher? And what woman doesn't shudder at the idea of being raped? Or being accused falsely of a crime one didn't commit? And reading about some of Jack's past helps give him a human face in the book ~~ it just didn't explore his personality like I hoped it would. It's almost as if Picoult is trying to write about rape, sex and its effect on women ~~ but something's missing there as it leaves me with more questions than revelations. This is a powerful subject but it misses the mark somewhere.<br />It is still a wonderful book ~~ just don't get your hopes up too much like I did. It just isn't my favorite Picoult book.	2001-05-13

Carl, the former manager and Natalie are also planning a wedding ~~ which Natalie's children heartily disapproves of because their father had only been dead for six months ~~ and this is just the beginning of a fun novel.<br />This novel is also a look into the complex relationships between children and parents, between friends and lovers. It is not a deep, engrossing book ~~ but it will do for a satisfying read. It isn't a book that will stay with you forever ~~ it is what I call a warm, fuzzy read. It is predictable what's going to happen ~~ but it is a sweet and tender story. <br />If you like a romance novel with a few how-tos thrown in, then you'll like this one. If you despise fluffy reading, then don't pick this one up.	2001-05-12

Her journey on the path of self-discovery comes complete with an ex-husband, Seamus O'Toole, a mother who falls in love with a neighbor upstairs, Louis the mailman, and Jake, the quiet, unassuming lawyer who falls in love with Katinka.<br />Katinka, struggling with the class issue, decides to fall in love with Louis ~~ but the way she kept it a secret in fear of her mother's reaction is hilarious. As always, secrets come to light and Katinka learns what love really is. Katinka's mother seems to always try to mold her into the person she thinks Katinka should be ~~ but with Katinka feeling her biological clock ticking, she discovers that she really wants to settle down and have a family.  This is just the beginning of a humorous story as Katinka reaches the crossroads in her life.<br />It is a fun read and one that every single thirty-something woman can relate to. It is about a woman struggling against the way she was brought up ~~ only to discover that sometimes Mother does know best! It is a quick read and enjoyable enough to forget your problems for a few hours. I recommend this book for a good, enjoyable read. If you're into serious tomes, this book isn't for you.	2001-05-12

They are the American-Italians whose parents came over from Italy in the early 1900s. It is a dark look into how customs shaped their lives and dreams and desires. <br />Raised by two Italians, the girls are ashamed of their mother who dresses in drab clothes and their father, who never really say anything to them ~~ just sleeps a lot. The girls dream of the day when they come become &quot;donne&quot; instead of &quot;ragazze&quot; ~~ only to discover the memories of home still keep them close. <br />This is a delightful read of two sisters who have never lost their bonds for one another. It is a book about two women struggling to be what they consider is &quot;American&quot; only to discover pride in their heritage. <br />It is a must-read for every woman who at one time longs to be free of their past and heritage, only to discover it's what shapes her to be the woman she is. It is also a quick read ~~ pure escapism for a couple of hours. Though not very deep as some of the books I like to read, it is still good enough for me to while away an afternoon on the hammock.	2001-05-12

Emma tells of her father, a well-known actor, David Wheaton, whose life is oftentimes compared to the other famous David ~~ King David of the Biblical times. David Wheaton has as many if not less wives and 11 children. Emma narrates the stories as the one child who has always remained close to her father. It is also a wonderful and encompassing story about love and forgiveness as David nears the end of his life.<br />Emma's husband struggles with writing a play for David Wheaton ~~ he would have played the great Hebrew king ~~ and interspersed throughout the narration are the stories of David's wives. Despite what some critics have said about this book, it is a rich read. I don't mind reading about Biblical times ~~ in fact, I love it. I find it fascinating. And L'Engle does a wonderful job giving King David's wives a voice throughout the ages and in a way the reader can understand. And reading about David Wheaton's wives, Emma's grandparents who have provided her with a heritage of rich spiritual lives, and the acceptance of life and death at the end.<br />It is a book I highly recommend for daughters who enjoy a close relationship with their fathers ~~ as it does explore a man's regrets that he didn't live a better life for his children or make the time for them ~~ but Emma forgives him anyways because that is who he is.<br />If you have a few days to spare, pick this book up. Go off into a quiet place and read it. You will fall in love with the lyrical writing style if not with the characters. It is definitely one of my top 100 favorite books to read. It's well worth the time reading.	2001-05-12

Sometimes, the book does seem drawn out and long ~~ but the writing prose is excellent and Shreve does a wonderful job (again) to keep the reader's interest. <br />The characters ~~ especially Olympia, the main character ~~ is well-drawn and you feel that though there are some parts of her identity that you don't understand, but you are still drawn to her. You watch her fall in love, struggle with the consquences of her love affair with Haskell, and watch her grow up from a provacative teenager to a sturdy young adult. <br />She, however, writes wonderful descriptions of the house in Fortune's Rocks and of the scenery. It makes one wants to live by the ocean and see the seasons change throughout the year. One can almost taste the salt in the breeze and hear the mute roar of the ocean tide. It's a great beach book!<br />It is a pleasant read ~~ despite the theme that runs through the book. It is a book best read in snatches; the dialogue and scenery can be a bit much to take sometimes. But overall, it is thought-provoking and well-written. It is a great book to take on a vacation ~~ where you don't feel the need to rush back into it.

It is just one of my favorite books of all time!<br />Benny, Eve, Sean, Jack, Nan and other characters are ones that you'll never forget. If you have friends that you ran around with in college and still keep in touch with ~~ I highly recommend this book. It is a book about friendship, love, romance and dreams. Any one of any age can read this book and find the meaning of friendship in it. With Benny's relationship with Jack ~~ there's that first love and intrigue; with Benny's friendship with Eve, there's the silliness that girls share as well as their confidences, hopes and dreams ~~ as well as recovering from broken hearts and disappointment; and there's Sean, the guy everyone loves to hate.

Fortunately, I started it over the weekend and finished it in one day. It is a fun mystery read ~~ gripping too. You can't put this book down without knowing what's going to happen next. <br />I really like the humor that Lescroart injected into the book. And though some of the lawyer terms are technical ~~ he was good about explaining the terms in layman's terms so I can understand it without feeling like a dunce. <br />Dooher is the main character ~~ suspected of killing his wife. Christina, the gorgeous woman who falls in love with Dooher, stands by her man. Wes Farrell is another lawyer who defends his best friend Tom Dooher from the charges ... and all of their lives are changed by his actions and statements. Glitzy (I'm not sure of the spelling here) is the investigator who is hot on Dooher's trail. And they all make for an interesting read as they work to solve the mystery. <br />I picked this book up by accident ~~ and though it doesn't rate to be my favorite book of the year, it did pass a lovely, lazy Sunday afternoon time with lots of ease and suspense. <br />If you're looking for a book with mystery and gripping suspense, I would recommend this book. But be warned, once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down. Best for a long air flight or for a lazy Sunday afternoon in the garden.	2001-04-30

Then I suggest you take this book along. It's pleasant and sweet ~~ you can't beat it with the pleasures of lying in the sun and listening to the mute roar of the ocean.	2001-04-26
2020491:US	49865122	RL10KUA2D27T5	0809015803	879652720	All But My Life: A Memoir	Books	5	15	16	N	N	What an insightful, honest look into the Holocaust camps	We of today's generation are bombarded with historical information that has happened in the past 100 years and they tend to lose their sting ~~ we're not all that interested in what had happened 50 years or so ago. We hear about it too often and become desensitized to it. But Klein's book will sting you with its brutal honesty and descriptions of life in a German camp. But at the same time, she will write of the glimmer of hope that persuades her to keep on living through the darkest hours of her life. She writes of the horror in such a way, that you feel that you are there, marching beside her to a future filled with dread. You are there when she was separated from her parents. You will weep when she realizes that her entire family is gone. And you will revisit the memories of the war during her happiest moments in life. You will fall in love with her husband ~~ the first American on the scene at the camp. You will shudder at the horrors that were visited upon the girls in those camps and the near misses of shootings, bombings and near death experiences. And a lot of us today have no experiences with starvation, disease, being invaded and being tortured simply because of our religious beliefs. We have no idea of how fortunate we are ~~ and Gerda Weissmann Stein reminds us that we are fortunate. We have never gone through anything even remotely close to what she, along with millions of others, have endured.<br />I did promise myself after reading &quot;Schlinder's List&quot; that I was never going to read another book on the Holocaust again ~~ it was just too hard on the heart and soul to read about others' suffering. But when a friend of mine suggested this book, I decided to try it. And I have nothing but words of praise and admiration for Gerda Weissmann Klein. This is a well-written account of her life before WWII, during the war and after the war. She has given me a new appreciation of the life I have now. I cannot imagine going through a life that she has endured simply because she was a Jew. <br />Mrs. Stein puts a human touch on the horrible camp experiences and she tells the story as if you were sitting in the room with her ~~ it's a personal story. One full of hope and courage and despair. It's a story that every one should hear because we shouldn't forget what had happened in Germany/Poland and other countries. We should listen to this story and be reminded of the fact that we all are part of the human race despite our differences. <br />I suggest that everyone should at least pick up this book and keep a box of kleenexes close by. It is one book that will change your whole outlook on the Holocaust. You won't forget it ~~ nor will you forget the courage that Mrs. Stein showed throughout the book. You will be haunted by some of the stories she shares with you ~~ but you won't forget. Not all Jews in the Holocaust are victims, there are survivors too. And Mrs. Stein is one who I call a survivor ~~ she doesn't let bitterness taint her story. She tells it as it is and shares her lessons on life along the way. It is an unforgettable book that I think belongs in every library.	2001-04-26

I wasn't going to pick it up ~~ but when I started reading the first paragraph, I couldn't put it down. Weldon's writing is gripping, brutally honest and so true ~~ and it hit home so close to the dark secrets in your heart.<br />I wasn't in an abusive relationship/marriage for very long but reading this book helps reaffirm my decision to leave my husband ~~ she writes of how bad things were before she finally decided to leave. I left before it got worse and before there were innocent children involved. And after reading this book, I am glad that I left as soon as I did. <br />It is encouraging to read about one woman's trials, fears as it helped me realize that I am not the only one. I too came from a loving stable family ~~ my relationship with my dad mirrors Weldon's. We both love our fathers deeply and they are good men. We both searched for men like our fathers and in the process, got hurt. Weldon's reasons for staying in the marriage mirrors mine. We didn't stay because of low self-esteem, but because we believed in our husbands and encouraged them to be the men we thought we knew they could be. We stayed till there were no reasons left to stay. We can still say to this day that we did everything we could to make our marriages work. We are not failures even though we may feel like that.<br />As for me, seeing the struggles she had with her three sons hit home. I wanted to have children, but something deep inside me told me to wait. I am so glad that I listened to this inner voice because I cannot imagine how much harder it would be for me to leave if I had children with my husband. Reading about Weldon's struggles reaffirmed my decisions to wait. I find myself saying about her husband ~~ what a jerk! <br />If you or anyone you know is in an abusive relationship, I urge you to pick up this book. Though in the midsts of struggles, where you feel the deepest and darkest despairsand fears, there is a glimmer of hope that life will get better. It does ~~ even if it means changing your whole life to escape from the batterer. But once you're outside and &quot;free&quot; you will begin to heal though the scars will always be there. Picking up this book is such a uplifter for me ~~ knowing that I am not the only one who struggled with domestic violence. I also know that I am not alone in my fears and despair. I, who is a professional worker and from a good family, am not the failure. He is. He can change himself but I can't. When I left him, I did feel a sense of relief. There's no more worrying and fears of what he might do next. It's a hard long road leaving someone you love, but when one comes to the realization that he will never change, there's a freedom in knowing that you still have your life left. And thanks to Weldon, I now know that I am not alone in this struggle.	2001-04-23

I was supposed to go to the computer repair shop and get my computer fixed ~~ but I couldn't put this wonderful book down!!<br />I've heard my friends raving about this book ~~ but it wasn't till I received this book that I understood why they love it so! To me, a house of gentle men sounds like a dream ~~ where men make ordinary women feel special, loved and redeemed ~~ just didn't seem like a good story to me. I was wrong. Hepinstall's writing style just drew me in ~~ gently like a bait drawing a fish to the hook. One paragraph and I was enthralled.<br />Hepinstall writes of terrible things that happen to women and men, shows the weaknesses of all people in their lives and gives a sense of hope for redemption for all. It is an unusual book and one that is never to be forgotten. It is a book that shares the evilness of human nature and also shares the forgiving spirit that lies deep within each of us. <br />It is also a well written book ~~ written to a rhythm that you have to listen for but once you hear it, it's in your bloodstream as you read along. It is a highly unique style of writing ~~ one I've never read before. It's Hepinstall's way of writing and should remain hers. I am amazed that this is her first book ~~ she writes like a pro.<br />I highly recommend this book not just for yourself, but for all women who have been hurt by men ~~ it's a book to be shared, not to be hoarded. Just don't give away your only copy as it will never be returned. Share the thoughts of Charlotte and Justin, Daniel, Milo and all of the characters as they struggle with life like we all do ~~ only to walk away with a renewed sense of hope. Pick it up and you won't forget it. Nor will you want to forget this gentle book.	2001-04-19

To please the person who loaned the book to me, I said I'd read it. To my chagrin, it's good. It's really good and it reminds me why I enjoy reading DeMille's books ~~ though it's in a genre that I normally don't pick up to read anymore!<br />This is a fast-paced book. With John Corey's sardonic sense of humor, Kate Mayfield's grace ~~ it's a fun read. It is also a nail-biting read as well ~~ I couldn't wait for the Easter family dinner to be over, so I could dive into the book! <br />At first, it does seem to be deeply entailed in the Islamic world and the quarry is a lot smarter than the detectives ~~ but DeMille doesn't disappoint the reader. There's enough there to keep the reader engrossed ~~ murder, intrigue, sex and humor. And believe it or not, you'll find yourself looking over your shoulder in a dark street ~~ to make sure that the Lion isn't after you! <br />If you're looking for a mystery to read, I suggest this one. It's a fun and fast-paced read. Just be sure not to read it in the dark of night ~~ where you can't identify every bump that goes in the night. Your imagination will go wild and that's what DeMille intends for his readers!!	2001-04-17

When I turned the last page in this book, I was a little sad ~~ because it's rumored to be her last book that she'll ever write. Fortunately, there isn't a law against re-reading her books again!<br />I do have one thing to suggest ~~ do not read this book while hungry. If you're hungry, grab a scone or muffin, a cup of tea and settle down for a nice long read. If you don't prepare the food first, you will find yourself settling the book down to make something to eat and you don't want to put the book down! <br />Cathy and Tom are partners in a new catering business called Scarlet Feather. They are also best friends ~~ becoming more so as their personal lives unraveled in a course of a year. There's Cathy's husband Neil, a barrister interested in saving the homeless ~~ and little time to spare for Cathy and her business. There's Marcella, Tom's live-in partner, whose dreams of being a famous model interferes with their plans for the future. There's Simon and Maud ~~ the twins who burrowed their way into the Scarlets' family lives ~~ and the reader's heart as well. There are other characters too ~~ too many to name individually. This book consists of many stories in a novel ~~ and everyone in it is related somehow to the main characters ~~ Cathy and Tom.<br />It may seem that Binchy skips around when writing of the different scenes in the characters' lives ~~ but don't despair. It does become less confusing as the story moves along. It's not my favorite way of reading, but once you're into the story, it's hard to put the book down. You just have to know what's going to happen next!!<br />I can guarantee that this book is not a boring book ~~ Binchy keeps the characters hopping with extraordinary events that happen in one year. This book is truly a story about ordinary people beset with events that seem to be out-of-control ~~ only to see everything fall in place. There are laughter, tears, anger and love ~~ a book to suit even the most persnickety reader. <br />And though this may be her last book (or so she claims), it leaves you with the hope that it isn't. No one can write like Binchy ~~ and you long for just one more book from her. Till then, read this one and remember why Binchy has captured your heart from her first book. It is a pleasant book ~~ and one that will capture the imagination as well as the heart.	2001-04-17

This is the third Jennifer Cruise book I've read so far and it's hilarious! I read it in one day ~~ despite the chaotic holiday weekend! What turns out to be a short-lived summer romance ends up being a hot romance. It was a book I couldn't put down.<br />Kate is a well-off business woman, who after three failed engagements, sets off to a resort in Kentucky in hopes to meet Mr. Right. She set up a list of the qualities that she wanted to see in her Mr. Perfect ~~ only to discover that despite best intentions, it didn't work. Hilarious accidents seem to befall the men who chase after her. As she begins to despair that she'll never find Mr. Perfect, Cupid has other ideas.<br />Jake is the man every woman loves to love ~~ handsome, charming, laid-back and sexy ~~ the only thing stopping him was a lack of ambition. He gave up the rat race five years prior just to enjoy life again. That was before Kate crosses paths with him. And she turns his life upside down, much to his chagrin. <br />Then the rest is history ~~ two people rediscovering what love is. And Cruise writes with gentle humor throughout the book ~~ and saucy sex scenes engraces the book (though not as revealing as some of her later books! Thank heavens!) ~~ it's a sweet book filled with laughter. It's a read that I highly recommend if you're taking the afternoon off to hang out at the pool or at the beach ~~ it's light, saucy and fun. So far, Jennifer Cruise hasn't disappointed me yet.	2001-04-17

And that's just the beginning of a fun, self-discovery journey that Minty takes you upon. Devastated, she and her bridesmaid fled to France ~~ courtsey of the dumping Dominic ~~ there, she meets Joe while playing table football. <br />From then on, it's a merry tale of Minty trying to adjust to single life again. Her wacky cousin Amber moves in, Minty's job suffers upheavals and comic actions, Dominic gets engaged AND dumps his next finacee and TRYS to get back with Minty ~~ only she's smarter this time around. And there's Joe who keeps Minty at arms' length. This book is chock full of happenings ~~ it can leave you quite breathless. But I can guarantee this, you won't be bored.<br />You will find yourself rooting for Minty as she works to get through the embarassment of being dumped in front of the altar on her biggest day. There are chuckles aplenty in this book and lots of sighs over romances gone sour and/or gone beautifully. It is just a positive book and one that I will definitely read again! Don't delay ~~ pick it up as soon as you can. It's such a fun read ~~ you can't beat it.	2001-04-11

I got this in the mail the other day ~~ by a secret donor (well, I think I know who it is!) and I'm hoping that she doesn't want it back because I really, really enjoyed this book! I am 31 and can relate to Nadine and Dig's problems with commitment and with trying to recapture the feelings of the flush of first love. This book is well-written, fun, saucy and so romantic! I was late to work today because I just had to finish off the last two chapters ~~ there was no way I was going to stew about for the next 12 hours waiting to see what happens. If a book can capture my interest like that, then by golly, I am going to finish it!<br />It is also a quick read ~~ but I can guarantee you that this is one book that you will want to re-read over and over. You will relate to Nadine ~~ who is a strong, independent woman with electic taste in clothes and designing flair. You will fall in love with Dig ~~ everyone's best friend and the one your mother always want you to marry. You will laugh over some of their adventures from being just best friends to realizing that they're in love with each other. <br />Grab it ~~ you won't regret it! I am now anxiously awaiting for Lisa's next book. I hope it's soon because I don't know how long I can last while waiting for it! =) In the meantime, I'm passing this book onto my book club friends and urge them to read it! It's just one of those sweet unforgettable books that makes for a perfect day of reading!	2001-04-08

I wish that Ms. Hood had written in depth about her characters ~~ instead, I got a fuzzy image of each one of them, which is disappointing because she could write more about Claudia, Elizabeth, Suzanne, Sparrow and Rebekah. They are the kind of women that I'd be interested in knowing a little better than the sketch that I was given in this book.<br />Claudia, Elizabeth and Suzanne were friends in college during the 1960s. Then one summer, each of them fell in love and got pregnant for the first time. Claudia and Elizabeth remained friends, while Suzanne moved to Boston to raise her daughter Sparrow alone. Claudia and Elizabeth married their respective lovers and raised families on a gorgeous farm ~~ with crabapple trees and daisies on that farm. Suzanne left her lover Abel because she refused to have an abortion ~~ and in turn became a hard, brittle woman whose daughter could never understand. Elizabeth also had a daughter Rebekah ~~ that she tried to understand but it wasn't till she was diagnosed with cancer that she was able to finally reach out to her daughter.<br />There is a thin story line here ~~ and that alone is disappointing. Ms. Hood could have written more about Elizabeth and Rebekah, Suzanne and Sparrow, and Claudia's inability to let go of her son who drowned. The ending leaves a lot of questions unanswered.<br />If you're looking for a quick read and something light, then I would recommend this book. It is well-written, but there isn't enough substance there to hold your imagination like a good author tries to do. It quite doesn't match up to my expectations of what a good book should do. It is sufficient enough if you need something light to read.	2001-04-08

Normally, I wouldn't enjoy this kind of book ~~ but I must've been in the mood for a good laugh. This is one hilarious book ~~ one that you shouldn't skim over the parts because you'll miss out on the images Sue was creating with her words. I learned that the hard way ~~ I am a speed reader and would skim over parts of the book till I realize just what she had said! Then I'd read it again ~~ and laugh hysterically after reading it!! <br />Anna is a married woman married to a hyprochondriac who hasn't had sex in several years. Dan is her husband ~~ he is just as funny as Anna ~~ though he can be real annoying. Then there's Anna's mom who was being stalked by an older man (now some of the headlines Anna and her friend came up with are just downright hilarious!) and there's Brenda, Anna's best friend. They will take you on an adventure through adultery and sex ~~ that while you may disapprove of ~~ but it rocks with laughter!!<br />If you're blue or down, then I recommend this book for laughs. In the meantime, I'm blue because her next book won't be available in the states till fall. I don't know if I can wait that long as her first book is hysterical. For someone who has always thought the Brits were serious and gloomy, this author has proven me wrong! <br />Enjoy this book ~~ in the humor it was meant to be ~~ and you'll never forget Anna's adventures.	2001-04-07

Then I suggest you pick this book right away and start reading ~~ it will be one book that you will never forget. I know. I re-read it every year and have been doing so for the last 10 years. I first picked it up during a summer working in Yellowstone ~~ that was when I started becoming interested in Native American Indian History ~~ and needing something lighter and easier to read, I started with &quot;Ride the Wind.&quot; <br />This is such a great beginning introduction to reading about the Comanches ~~ even though the book is a novel ~~ it is based on what few known historical facts on Cynthia Parker and the man who she calls husband ~~ Wanderer, one of the last great Comanche chiefs. Robson writes with passion the story of a white girl kidnapped by the Indians in her youth ~~ and how she transformed her ways to those of the tribe. It is a heart-warming story, one that will haunt you for the rest of your life. It also shows a softer side to the Indians that you normally won't see ~~ they're not the savages as people make them to be. I'm not saying that they're not fierce warriors ~~ they are and do practice warfare with a savergy that is different from what historians call &quot;civilised society.&quot; But Robson shows the fierce loyalty the Comanche have for their tribe and one another ~~ and their way of life.<br />Pick this book up. I guarantee that you won't walk away from it without being haunted by the stories that Cynthia and her friends share with you. It is an eye-opener into the way of life then. And it is a heart-breaking story as well. Try it and see. I don't think you'll regret it.	2001-04-02

It has everything in it, romance, true love, intrigue, despair, hope, humor and happiness. It is a great read ~~ you won't be able to put it down right away! It seems to be a hefty book but it's not. If it starts out slow, don't give up. The best is yet to come. <br />When I started this book, I had the impression that it was going to be a dark, gloomy book ~~ but that impression changed half way through it. David had just lost his wife Rachel to cancer and unable to cope with anything, he starts working on his family gardens. Sent to America on a marketing job for a few days, David realizes that he couldn't face Scotland without Rachel and applies for a gardening job. Then he becomes involved with a family that he works for. <br />This novel is a progression of a man's journey through grief only to find hope and love again. It is an emotional book and one that you can't put down easily. You just keep turning the page, promising yourself that this page is going to be it for the night ~~ only to turn the page again. You find yourself rooting for the characters ~~ and by the end of the book, you feel as if the sunshine has come upon you as well as David.<br />Take it and read it ~~ don't be discouraged by the different writing style ~~ there will never be another Rosamunde Pilcher ~~ but Robin is unique and creative in his own way. His mom should be proud of him.	2001-04-02

It was informative read about Teddy and Franklin Roosevelts and their families as well as how their destinies crossed paths in the political world. It is also a glimpse of how life was in the early 1900s ~~ a fascinating glimspe of the world and politics then. Back then, it seems that everyone was interested in politics ~~ not just for their own personal gains, but because it meant something to them. <br />It is also an interesting read about the Roosevelt children ~~ how Teddy's kids differ from Franklin's children. They are not the main characters in the book ~~ but they are written about quite extensively as well. The readers also could feel the impact of the wives throughout the book. <br />Collier writes with a flair ~~ he doesn't write just of historical facts, but also of some common knowledge and with a flair. He made this biography interesting ~~ unlike some of his peers who writes with a dull pen. By the time I finished reading this book, I was impressed at how little I knew of the Roosevelts when I picked it up ~~ and how little I knew of the impacts their decisions were felt throughout society and time itself. And now that I know, I feel I had a small glimpse in politics then, and of their lives as presidents and as ordinary men. Only, those two were never meant to be ordinary ~~ fate decrees otherwise. Fortunately for us Americans.	2001-04-02

Only, I read it first and couldn't put it down. Then it passed onto two more friends ~~ only they couldn't put it down. It is probably one of the best impulse buys I have ever made.<br />Margaret George wrote an intensive book on the queen of Scotland, who was also related to Elizabeth I somewhat distantly. George did a great job of telling Mary's story ~~ a story of a rash, flighty woman who didn't stop to think before acting. Who thought with her emotions (such a different queen than her English cousin!) ~~ defied the normal conventions and rules set upon her by her advisors and did whatever she thought she wanted to do. Naturally, we all know how the story turns out in the end ~~ but George does a wonderful job of epicting &quot;what might have happened&quot; throughout this novel. And she does a wonderful job combining facts within the novel ~~ so you might pick up a few things here and there about Scottish history. <br />For those of you who want to read about the royalty but are too intimidated to read the historical tomes, I suggest you read this one. It's long ~~ but the writing itself will keep you interested and propells you onto the way to learning more about history. When you finish the last page, you rest in confidence that you tackled such a hefty book ~~ and you walk away just a little smarter about history. If a book can get you to do that, then the praises should rest on George's head.	2001-04-02

Reading this book has helped me delve more deeply into the woman who many has made into a legend. I was surprised too at the movie &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; ~~ which I really enjoyed ~~ but a lot of stuff in there were not historically accurate. If you want accurate historical notes, check out this book by Alison Weir. She has a talent for combining dry historical facts and make them interesting. The characters on the great historical stage appears alive, interesting and human ~~ unlike mythical tales that make men and women appear larger than they really are. <br />There are lots of books about Elizabeth I out there ~~ but so far, this one does the job of informing me of how the queen lives, breathes and dies in her own age. Truly, Elizabeth is a queen of all time. And this book comes highly recommended. If you're interested in history, pick this book up. It's a great complement to everyone's libraries.	2001-04-02

I wanted so often to shake Mandy and say ~~ look here kid, this is not the end of the world!! Then why are you making those dumb mistakes?? I felt despair often throughout this book ~~ through her choices and choices that others made, Mandy travels through life confused and lost. Between a selfish, self-centered and abusive mother, a father who died of a heart attack, her boyfriend Booner ~~ Mandy struggles with trying to find herself in the process of a cruel, harsh and unrelenting world.<br />If an author can make me feel this strongly about a character and have me make excuses for someone when I normally don't, then she deserves a 4 star ~~ but I must say that I will not add this book to my personal library ~~ because it was too intense for me. I didn't like the characters and oftentimes, felt like I was watching Jerry Springer live. We all make our own choices and should live by them despite the hard knocks we all get in life. Yes, Mandy had it rough growing up ~~ having a white trash family doesn't help. But she should have taken the help offered to her by her college roommate instead of running away. There is a lot of shoulds interwoven throughout this book ~~ and that is how life is. I didn't feel sorry for Mandy ~~ if that was what the author intended. I got tired of her excuses and found myself wanting to shake her and say, snap out of it kid. Wake up and smell the coffee! I have drawn my own conclusions of what happened at the end ~~ but don't want to spoil it for any potential readers.<br />I do recommend this book for any readers who are open to reading new experiences. Brown does do a good job of drawing the reader into her story. And you will question what you read. And you will walk away from the book with new ideas. And that is one of the highest compliments a reader can pay to the author. Even if we didn't like the book, at least the book made us think. Just for that reason alone, I'd recommend this book.	2001-03-30

He becomes obssessed with her affair and at the same time, narrates how the affair affects the family throughout the year. There's Elvira, who is obssessed with becoming a Civil War re-enactor. There is his dad, Kevin Shaw, who lives in a different world of his own ~~ wrapped up in his teaching career and students. And there's Henry himself, in the midst of discovering first love with one of his oldest childhood friends. <br />Hamilton does a great job interweaving the characters together throughout this book and she does a great job with the descriptions ~~ you feel that you're there. But after awhile, Henry's obssession with his mother begins to wax and wane ~~ and you start thinking to yourself, this kid needs to get a life. It all starts innocently enough by accidentally reading Beth's emails, but after awhile, without any confrontation between any of the characters ~~ it seems to drag on and on. <br />I have read one other of her books and enjoyed that one much more ~~ The Book of Ruth ~~ at least you are drawn into the characters' lives. But this book ~~ it drags on after a certain point and never really picks up again. By the time I was finished with it, I was relieved. I'm not saying this is a bad book to read ~~ it just isn't what I thought it would be. I rate it 3 stars for the superb writing ~~ not for the plot itself. I'm glad I read it ~~ but I won't read it again. It's not going to rank as a classic in my personal library.	2001-03-30

It is a delightful, quick read ~~ I read it in one day. <br />Ruth and Amanda are the main characters in this book. Ruth lost her mother at a young age to drowning, and Amanda is her aunt, who raised her from toddler on. This story is about their relationship and how love can be too smothering at times. There is also a mystery woven throughout the book as well, just exactly how did Ruth's mother drown ~~ when she was an agile swimmer? <br />This book keeps you hopping and engrossed ~~ just when you think you can't read another page, you find yourself turning the page just to see what happens next. It is a bittersweet story of a woman growing up and of a woman letting go. Out of all the Oprah's picks I've read lately, this book ranks among the top picks. It is easy to read and it still haunts you after finishing the book. I recommend this book if you're looking for a lighter Oprah read.	2001-03-27

There are Mike Sr., Corrine, Mike Jr., Patrick, Marianne andJudd, who happen to live the dream that everyone dreams of. They livein this gorgeous old farmhouse with lots of farmland and animals ~~horses, cats, dogs and cows and other strays. Mike Jr. is the perfectolder child ~~ the football star, Patrick is the brainy child,Marianne the gorgeous cheerleader and Judd is the child that tagsalong after his more glamourous siblings. Mike Sr. is a successfulbusinessman and Corinne, the mom everyone wishes they had. Narratedfor the most part by Judd, this book goes into the relationships thefamily had with each other and others ~~ till a dark tragedy tears thefamily apart.<br />That's when Oates show the dark underbelly of a&quot;perfect&quot; family. That was when the family failed each otherin the time of greatest need ~~ especially for Marianne, who sufferedrape. Oates did a good job getting into each of her characters' mindsand she showed the ultimate selfishness on the parents' parts whocouldn't handle their daughter's pain because they couldn't handletheir own pain and disappointment. I have never read of more selfishpeople till I read this book. They failed their daughter and in turn,failed their other children and failed themselves. <br />If you arelooking for a &quot;pretty&quot; book, this is not it. If you'relooking for a book with character development, this is it. I must warnyou, it is long and gloomy ~~ and I have several times wanted to giveit up ~~ but Oates keep you ensared in the characters' thoughts andemotions and you just have to know how it ended. Though not directlytalked about, rape is an issue that divides families and parents apartfrom one another.  Oates did do a good job in showing that division ~~....  It is a thought-provoking book ~~ but it's not one that you'llread again.	2001-03-24

It weaves in ancient folklore with whispers of Lilith, the Mother Goddess of all the earth. And Na'amah tells the story softly to enchant the readers into listening to what may have happened in the Garden of Eden. It weaves together the creationist and evolution theories together. <br />I must be brutally honest here ~~ I did not care for Adam and Eve in this story. I walked away with the impression that those two are incredibly selfish and bent on having their own way of doing life. In the hunter-gatherer age, the clan was very vital for survival. No one could survive outside of the clan. Adam came up with a new vision to create a new beginning of the way life should be ~~ a farmer rooted in one spot. It's a great vision ~~ for it led the way to our lifestyles today ~~ but to accomplish that, he had to deny the daughter he had. Na'amah wanted nothing more than to haver her father to love her ~~ which he was never able to do, especially after he set eyes on Eve. He wasn't allowed to marry Eve because of the tradition that a man should never remarry while the offspring of his first wife was still alive. He literally had to resort to murder to accomplish his dream of marrying Eve. <br />It is an awesome feat of changing the way a clan shall live from then on ~~ that is how things evolve over time. Adam can be credited with having the foresight of changing the future ~~ but he can also be credited with destroying a beautiful way of life and for destroying the garden. Eve in this book is nothing more than an immature child with eyes only for Adam. She was the temptress ~~ but so immature!<br />I could go on and on with discussing this book but I better not ~~ so you can read the book yourself. I highly recommend this book, especially if you like &quot;The Red Tent&quot; by Anita Diamant (I think that's her last name!). &quot;Leaving Eden&quot; is abook that leaves you feeling that your vision of Eden is slightly altered ~~ it is a what if book ~~ what if Adam hadn't met Eve, what if Eve was a different woman, and what if the ruler of the universe is a woman. It just gives you a different perspective of how things could have been. It is a book that requires a lot of imagination ~~ just listen to Na'amah tell the story and listen carefully. It'll be worth your journey.	2001-03-21

I started it last night and stayed up till 3 a.m. to finish this book! I really enjoyed this book ~~ it was funny, lighthearted and cute! I laughed out loud in some places and found myself shaking my head in other places.<br />Rebecca is a girl who overdraws her bank account and maxes out her Visa card. I am not a big shopper (unless you call shopping for books a shopping spree ~~ then I am!) of clothes but it was funny just to hear her describe her clothes like she is posing for Vogue or Cosmo or even 17. Her justification for buying things are hilarious and the scene where she was trying to make curry made me laugh so hard! (I'm a cook and that scene just cracks me up because I've done the same thing she did!) Sophie took a character riddled with anxieties and insecurities and made her so likeable ~~ you can't help but laugh at some of her excuses. She has a vivid imagination which really carries the book through.<br />I can see why some of the critics didn't care for this book ~~ it does sound like something from a fashion magazine, but Sophie is a good, clean writer. I really enjoyed this book and would like to read more of hers. Her sense of humor is a lot like mine and it is a refreshing read! I recommend it for a light, easy reading and if you're looking for humor, this book has it all.	2001-03-20

It has such an uplifting beat to it and it was hard for me to put it down just to go to work!<br />It's about Jenny Brown on a search to find fulfilling happiness with her life. All she wanted was: A happy marriage, a job she loves and a reunion with her birth mother. <br />This book takes you on a journey as she discovers what really matters in life. She falls into directing a play at a local school by accident (let's say, the job was thrown at her!) and discovers herself in the process. She had just moved from Cambridge to California, feeling lonely as her husband worked in a lab 24/7, and hates her job as a loan officer. She stumbles into the Institute of Affirmation, an adult education center offering oddball courses such as Homecooking for Pets and so on. The friends that she has made, the discoveries she realized and lessons learned all tie up neatly in this book.<br />It is a great affirmative read ~~ and Jenny is like each one of us. After all, we all have gone throughs jobs where we hated it, a dull, staid marriage and a feeling of not belonging anywhere. This book does make you stop and think about where you are going in life and what you want to do with it. I'm not saying that it is a philosophical book ~~ but it does make you think a little harder than some of the other books you may have read. It's a rare jewel of a book that can do that!<br />This book is a perfect addition to anyone's library!	2001-03-20

It was a pleasant surprise to read that she is an Ohio State University professor and it was even nicer to read that this book is set in Ohio too! I thoroughly enjoyed this book ~~ light, funny and sexy. Who ever says small towns are boring need to read this book!<br />It all starts with a dog. Quinn McKenzie rescues a small dog and falls in love with her. She decided to keep her in spite of her boyfriend's objections. Then her &quot;beige&quot; life (where she's dating the nicest guy, has a good job, surrounded by friends and family ~~ only to realize that she was bored to tears) suddenly changed into a life of color (there's even a huge red couch in her new life). Between dog-nappings, breaking and entering, seduction, sabotage, stalking, secrets and suddenly two men who were crazy for her ~~ it's enough to keep you interested in the book.<br />It is a quick read and funny as heck. There are some scenes in there that reminded me too much of my experiences with a stalker ~~ Cruise writes that vividly! I would wait till the last minute to go to work because I was so caught up in the book. Then the first chance I would take, I would grab it and start reading it again! <br />Even if you don't need a reason to buy this book, I recommend it anyways. It's fun, sexy, terrifying all rolled into one ball. Since I have read two of Cruise's books, I will be keeping an eye out for the rest of her collection. Once you start reading this one, you're hooked. And it's a ride that you won't easily forget.	2001-03-19

This story about two sisters who enter the small Ohio town of Temptation and wreak chaos on the lives of the townspeople is full of zany humor and sexy surprises! The story focuses on Sophie, the good sister in the Dempsey family ~~ a family known to be from the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot; and Amy, her sister, who wants nothing more than to be a movie producer. <br />Sophie and Amy enters the town to shoot a video for one of Temptation's own who wants to be a movie star. Only the homecoming video was turning into an erotic video and the plot thickens with the townspeople erupting into an uproar. Phin Tucker, the town's mayor, and Wes, the police chief much rather play pool but instead, are drawn into the controversy surrounding Sophie and Amy. <br />It is a quick read and a fun one too. There are places in the story where you laugh out loud and suddenly realize that you're in a quiet waiting room where everyone's staring at you. Oops. It is a fun, fun book to read. One I highly recommend to put on that summer reading list!	2001-03-19

If you're looking for something is easy on the eyes and brain (meaning you don't have to think deep, probing thoughts), then this book is for you.<br />It's about a rich and cranky billionaire ~~ the king of toilet paper ~~ who decides to throw his greedy heirs off balance by announcing that he has found a new heir ~~ his long-lost granddaughter, Annie. Grady Sullivan is hired to be Archie's bodyguard, only to fall in love with the sassy granddaughter. And that's just the beginning of the adventures that the Peevers family saga endures. Between a butler who is known to &quot;lift&quot; things from the ugly mansion they all are residing in, a son who hides behind his wife's skirts, a dumb blondshell who giggles through everything ~~ guns, arrows, car crashes and everything that can make a mystery novel work. And of course, the romance between Annie and Grady makes for a happy ending. <br />It is a cute book ~~ one that you can take to the beach or read on the subway because it doesn't require a lot of thinking. And it is a guarantee that you'll laugh at some parts of the plot. Great book for a light read ~~ though the writing isn't of top quality. Like I said, if you want something light and sassy, then this should do it!	2001-03-19

If you like those dry British wit, then this book is for you to read ~~ both men and women. <br />Everyone who is single can definitely relate to this book ~~ Ralph with his puttering around till being in love with his flatmate made him a big success in the art world; Smith with his snobby attitude and in love with the girl upstairs while dallying with his other flatmate, Jem who is in love with him. Then there's Cheri who is in love with Karl, who is in love with Siobhan. It is a book about six people in love with someone other than whom they are with. It is a classic love triangle. And it comes to a final explosion at Ralph's party. <br />Interspersed with grace and humor, there are some crudity ~~ what do you expect when you have guys in the book as well? But all works well by the end of the novel. And I do have to say, I totally relate to Siobhan, who left Karl after 15 years and rediscovered herself in the process. She and Jem are the only two characters (beside Ralph, of course) who have any depth to them. Those two are ordinary women who made themselves extraordinary by the time Ralph's party came into full swing. And Ralph. He's the guy every woman wants to bring home to meet their parents. At first though, he didn't give off a good impression. But he fell under Cupid's arrow and turned his life around ~~ that is impressive.<br />Not bad for a first novel effort. I won't rush to the bookstore to buy her next book, but I won't turn her down either. I am curious to see how Thirtysomething would turn out ~~ if I ever get a hand on that copy. <br />All in all, it is a good book. Grab a glass of lager and kick back for a few hours and read it. It's a great way to fritter away a cold night.	2001-03-13

This story about a man who suddenly loses his beloved wife after being married for years only to rediscovered life and love is wonderfully written. Make sure you keep a kleenex handy as it is sad and uplifting. You will relate to the main character, Bill, as he stumbles through the dark days of grieving. He goes out into the dating world again ~~ unsure of what to expect ~~ everyone can relate to that regardless of how they loses their spouse. Also, he describes his characters ~~ Lannie and Elena ~~ as well as the others ~~ with vivid descriptions. You feel that you are there in the room eavesdropping on their conversations.<br />Bill does find love again and this time learns a meaningful lesson that each day is precious. You can never recapture a lost moment ~~ but you can live tomorrow with the vow of making sure nothing gets unappreciated or taking a chance to live.<br />I found this book to be really interesting since it was a man that wrote such a romantic book. He captures the emotions and dreams very vividly. While reading it, you feel that you are Bill torn between wanting to fall in love again and wanting to stay in love with his lovely wife that died unexpectedly. It is a man who lives an average life ~~ battling cancer at the same time ~~ and finding his way to light.<br />I recommend this book to everyone ~~ once you get into it, you cannot put it down. You find yourself cheering Bill on as well as sympathizing with his sorrows. It is a book that will make you stop and think ~~ I shouldn't be taking anything or anyone for granted because it may not be here tomorrow. This book is about taking chances with life ~~ living it to the fullest. And a book like that is a perfect addition to everyone's personal library!	2001-03-12

I was a little disappointed because the author kept bashing Cleveland ~~ a city that has worked hard to reinvent herself into a metropolitan. But that's beside the point.<br />For every bride or bride-to-be, this book is definitely something that we all can relate to! Lily experiences last-minute jitters about getting married to the guy of her dreams. With three weeks to go, she decided that they haven't known each other long enough to get married ~~ plus she wanted to go back to New York. It is a hilarious account of an overbearing mother who is pushing for the wedding of the millenium, father-in-law who couldn't resist to show off his newest daughter-in-law-to-be, a fiance who is perfect beyond words, even hilarious accounts of the kids in there ~~ every bride's nightmare come true! ~~ Lily had to fight her way through all the entanglements to really discover what she really wanted.<br />I found it amusing ~~ it would have been even better if she hasn't kept knocking Ohioans down throughout the book. You can relate to Lily as she struggles with loving Mark but not wanting to get married to him just yet. You can roll your eyes at the sisters who are so snotty and suburban. You can shudder when the mother of the bride keeps insisting on carrying through with the wedding. And you will just love the grandmother who is practical and on Lily's side throughout this confusing time. You will shudder at some of the stuff at the bridal fair. Every bride will enjoy this light-hearted novel and find something in it to relate to.<br />And Lily will keep you guessing to the end. If you can get past the snide remarks about Ohio and the Midwest, then you will enjoy this book.	2001-03-12

I do remember reading Wuthering Heights ~~ but that was in college. Jane Eyre is much more romantic than Wuthering Heights ~~ it is a Cinderella Tale with a happy ending too!<br />Jane was orphaned at a very young age and was raised by a cold-hearted aunt and terrible cousins before being shipped off to an institution. Jane makes the best of her lowly lot in life and decided to take a chance of living life to the fullest by taking a governess job for Mr. Rochester. Little does she know how much life would change because of that decision!<br />The trials and tribulations that beset Jane are those that every woman can identify with. The joy and fear of falling in love with Mr. Rochester (Edward) is inspiring. The tragic secret that Edward failed to disclose to Jane ~~ sending her away is so sad. Jane finds herself again in a town many miles away from her beloved ~~ and finds her family after all these years. Only the unrequited love for Edward was the mar on the beautiful paradise she has found. She does find love again and grows into this splendid woman who is strong and independent ~~ and yet, still very feminine.<br />I strongly believe that everyone should read this classic as Charlotte Bronte wrote a thought-provoking novel filled with description and conversations. It is a moral book ~~ designed to make the reader think of what is right and what is wrong. Jane stood up for her belief at the cost of her love ~~ though it was one of the hardest decisions she has ever had to make. And love finds her again.<br />This is a book that makes you believe that if you have faith, things will come right and true for you. Even if it wasn't already a classic, it should be. How many books have withstood the test of time? This one is a golden treasure to add to your library!	2001-03-12

I am beginning to think that not ALL Oprah's picks are gloomy ~~ this book is far from gloomy; it's thought-provoking, fun, tragic and interesting. You pick up tidbits of information that you never thought to learn ~~ example, Tao's reverence for &quot;Golden Lilies&quot; is typical in his culture (bounded feet that Chinese women think glorifies their beauty ~~ as well as being helpless and feminine), wherease nowadays, most women would scoff at the idea of being helpless and so feminine ~~ we don't really need men to protect us. In China, that was the woman's role ~~ to be defenseless and to bear boy babies. (Girl babies are often thrown out with the trash ~~ in Chile, where the other main character derives from, girls aren't revered either.)<br />This is not just a love story about a Chinese man who falls in love with a Chilean girl with the &quot;big feet.&quot; This is a book about a young girl who falls in love with her Chilean lover and travels to California to find him. On the way, she discovers the realities of life ~~ as a woman, there were only two options opened to her: prostitute or some man's wife. She decides to disguise herself as a Chilean boy to protect herself in the rough days of the Wild West and the hunt for gold that swept through California and the world and in the process, finding herself as a woman again ~~ not a wimpy female who couldn't do anything for herself, but as a strong independent character who can survive on her own. This is also a story of a Chinese man who finds himself in California, making his way and fortunes of the time. This book entertwined their stories.<br />This is also about women who finds themselves &quot;trapped&quot; behind their corsets, society's mores and rules. This is also a story about racial issues ~~ Tao was told once never to look at a white man in the eye because it was a sign of disrespect. Though California is a melting pot, for a long time, racial unrest unsettles the people there ~~ till money speaksvolume. Between ship captains, gold lust, prostitutes, racy novels ~~ it's all there in this book. <br />This is not your typical romantic read, nor is it Oprah's typical gloomy book. This book is about going after your own fortunes and fulfilling your dreams whether you're a man or a woman. It's about daring to take a chance despite the circumstances you'd find yourself in and going along with the wild ride that is called Life. Reading this book is like taking a ride into the past, with your perceptions changed.	2001-03-06

I too have found myself saying throughout reading this book, oh yeah, I so know what she's talking about. Oh yes, that happened to me too. And I never thought I would relate to the main character, Fran/Beth as she escapes from an abusive husband. Her fears of being found, thoughts of how it's her fault and so on are disturbingly realistic. <br />More and more women are talking about domestic violent, and just now, they are being taken a lot more seriously. Fortunately, some of us don't have to go underground ~~ changing our lifestyles completely, moving to a strange place just so we can stay alive ~~ but this book speaks to our deepest fears. We fear of losing everything ~~ our homes, our friends, our children and our lives ~~ because we fear the one person who promised to protect and cherish us. If we can't trust the one man who promised to protect us ~~ especially from him, then how can we trust anyone else? Quindlen explores that issue with a thorough directness throughout her book. <br />As gloomy as this book may be, there is a glimmer of hope. Victims of domestic abuse can relive their lives again ~~ even with the fear that hangs over them for the rest of their lives. It's about one woman who decides to live her life despite her ex-husband and having to go &quot;underground&quot; for awhile. She finds true love the second time around ~~ with a man who doesn't use violence to control her. <br />Every woman should read this book and see the dark sides of marriages that do happen ~~ and women should speak up against domestic violence ~~ it can happen to you.	2001-03-06

It's not as funny as Isabell Wolff's &quot;The Trials of Tiffany Trott,&quot; nor any of Marian Keye's books ~~ for an American writer, this is pretty dishy and funny. If you like reading about sex in L.A. or Hollywood, then this book is it. <br />Elizabeth West is a free-lance screenwriter who is dreading being in the &quot;Zone.&quot; The Zone is that age between 28 and 35 where women start thinking about their biological clock and settling down with a man. So every date is a &quot;Maybe&quot; and most often than not, it's usually a &quot;No Way.&quot; Or about how a man would call for the second date and he never does ~~ it's about how women try their hardest to capture a man's attention and how hard they work to keep it ~~ it's a cynical view of dating and marriage. <br />This book explores a woman's dating life (er, well, sex life) as she tries to find the one man that she would spend her life with. Elizabeth West portrays the average L.A. party girl, fascinated with designer shoes and making it big with her screenplay, keeping in touch with her friends and living life in the fast lane (except drugs ~~ that's not her style, alcohol is more like it). It's not a thought-provoking book by any means, but it is escapism.<br />The Brits writers (Keyes, Trott etc.) still have the corner on the single woman's plight as she searches for marriage, meaning to life and so on ~~ dashed with lots of humor; but Wolper doesn't do such a shabby job with her first book. It is fun to read and you can still relate to Elizabeth West as she struggles for acceptance in the hardest city of the world ~~ Hollywood. It's a lot more realistic than you expected from Tinseltown, but it's still a glamourous read.	2001-03-06

Elizabeth Berg takes you on a journey between two best friends as one of them embarks on her final journey for life. Annie and Ruth became the best of friends after meeting each other at a party. When Ruth was diagnosed with breast cancer, Annie learns the meaning of love and letting go while Ruth handles her dying with grace and humor. <br />This is a book I would definitely recommend for friends to give to one another. Elizabeth Berg knows how to write about women ~~ how they talk, eat, live and gossip among themselves. This is a treasure about friendship. Men don't understand the connection women feel for one another ~~ how we need to laugh and cry during life's most stormiest times, and how we need our friends' love and friendship as well. Berg does a wonderful job drawing the readers into the private lives of the characters ~~ and you don't feel that you are standing on the outside either. You're drawn to Annie because of her nurturing, caretaker nature, and you're drawn to Ruth like a moth to a flame ~~ full of life and laughter.<br />If you haven't read this book yet, I would suggest you do so soon. Breast cancer is still the number one killer among women and though this book doesn't really talk about cancer itself, it does talk about love, friendship, survival and death. It is a book to treasure ~~ to pass on between friends, mothers and daughters.	2001-03-02

This one is about divorce ~~ a sudden surprise to Sam, who all of a sudden is caught unawares ~~ though there have been signs of marital discord in her marriage for a while. So Sam decides to gather in boarders so she can keep her big house, and she goes to work for a temp agency ~~ learning different jobs each week. It is a fun book especially for someone who is going through a divorce.<br />This is a quirky read ~~ of a woman's self-discovery as she deals with the aftermath of her husband's leaving, her best friend and mother trying to fix her up with dates, a new friend she meets, and entering work force for the first time in 20 years ~~ and so forth. It is a light read, easily read in one day, full of laughter and grace. I highly recommend it for a light read if you're in the midst of troubles.	2001-03-02

This one barely had any defense when Barbara is called upon to defend the wife of a man who was killed in an accident. Only, after an investigation, the man was discovered to be murdered and the spotlight of suspicion turns upon his wife. Barbara has to find evidence that the wife didn't do it ~~ and she takes you along on a journey of investigating what really happened that night on the mountaintop!!<br />Once again, Kate Wilhelm takes you along for a ride. She draws you into the story ~~ just look at the first sentence in the book ... &quot;The rising sun is veiled with desert haze, rose-red streaks extending north and south against a royal blue that only gradually turns maeve.&quot; And there you go ... hooked into the story with its backdrop against the desert and the mountains. <br />Wilhem is a master writer ~~ everyone should try reading one of her Holloway books and once they do, they're fans for life. Wilhelm doesn't disappoint her readers!!	2001-03-02

I picked it up from the library and finished it in one day ~~ now, all I have to do is try the recipes that Karen Stolz so generously put into the book!<br />This book is about Roxanne, who is 12-years-old in the beginning of the book and it details her growing up years ~~ from a tomboy transformed into a graceful woman. Growing up in a small town, Roxanne learns that life isn't always fair or always nice. <br />Between the whimiscal lifestyle of a small town, a mother who gets pregnant during Roxanne's teenage years, friends, boyfriends, crushes, first love, death, marriage ~~ it brings back memories of your growing up years. It is a wonderful journey through memory lane ~~ especially during the 60s in Texas. Roxanne is everyone's next-door neighbor ~~ the one you watch growing up. <br />If you're looking for a book that doesn't bog you down with gloom and despair, then I recommend this one. You won't be bogged down ~~ not with this book! There is no place like home and as Roxanne discovers, you can go home again.	2001-03-02

This book describes the ordeal that Connie went through while watching her vibrant mother slowly dissolves into a confused woman filled with self-doubt. <br />This is an interesting book ~~ you'll learn more about childbirth than you ever wanted to know ~~ and it does preach the cons and pros of midwives compared to hospital births. This is a story of a love between a mother and a daughter, wife and husband, friendships, loyalties, client and lawyer ~~ it covers a lot of range in this book. It changes the way you perceive things too ~~ I didn't know much about midwives or what their roles are ~~ I usually hear of the old tales where midwives are usually dirty and so forth, but not in this book. Sibyl takes care of her clients better than a lot of doctors do ~~ only something went wrong with one delivery. It seems that Mother Nature was conspiring against her as well as a jealous intern. This book does provoke a few emotions, so be warned.<br />It is a quick read as well and not as depressing as some of Oprah's other books. It's a learning experience.	2001-02-21

Finally, I went to the bookstore and bought it. And I was hooked. Aliena, Jack, Richard, Philip, Tom, Ellen, William among other characters come alive in these pages. You feel exasperation, horror, awe, wonder as you discover just how hard life is in the middle ages. You learn how they build catherals then. You become involve with the intrigues, treachery, loyalties, passion ~~ it's a great book for both men and women to read. It may be a hefty book to read, but once you do, you cannot escape the characters' words and lives as easily as you think. Follett takes you right into his middle ages world and you walk out with a view of life then forever changed.    If you need to escape from realism ~~ or you're looking for a book that has love and hate, loyalties and treachery, hope and despair, I guarantee that you will find it all in this one!    **** UPDATE ****    This is now seven years later and I just finished reading it again for a book club. I swore that I wasn't going to spend my time reading a monster book like this one. I loved it then and am sure that I would love it again, but I just didn't have time to devote to the size of this book. But it took me in and wouldn't let me go, you know. I just HAD to read it again and could not put it down till the last page was turned. This is probably the only time where I can honestly say that it's a good thing that there's nothing on TV (all of my favorite shows aren't on the air these days), because I was able to finish this book in a week. I really couldn't put it down.     What do you say about this book that hasn't been said by hundreds of reviewers? It's big. It's fast. It's full of likeable characters and dishonorable ones too. It shows all the ranges of human emotions between fear, anger, disgust, love, pride, and shows the depths of actions like fighting for one's honor, dreams, ambitions and so forth. There's Tom Builder who had a dream of building his own cathedral and nearly starved himself and his entire family while holding out for that dream. There's Philip the Monk who wanted to have Kingsbridge to have the largest cathedral in England at that time. There's Aliena, a displaced Earl's daughter who suffered abuse, starvation and indignity at the hands of her rejected suitor, William, and yet, somehow overcame those adversities to find love again and regained her honor, her dreams and kept her oath to her father at the same time. There's Richard, her brother, a weak man who was twisted by anger and revenge. There's William Hamleigh, a weak man who preys on others to make himself feel invincible. There's Jack, the hero of this novel, who grew up in the forest not knowing who his father was nor his family history, but still became a builder of great proportions. There's ambitious bishops, devious priests, kings and queens fighting over everything at the expense of the people.     This is a novel of immense proportions and a perfect one for book clubs to discuss. It's one of the best novels around. If you like historical fiction, you will like this one. If not, then don't waste your time because it's a huge book to read and it might discourage you from reading it all the way through. However, if you've wanted to try reading in a new genre, I will have to say that I can't imagine a better one to start with. It's just full of good reading and it cannot be put down till the last page has been turned.     I think I appreciate it better this time around than I did the first time. There's so much more that I picked up that I didn't remember the first time around. So in my opinion, this book is a keeper.     1/28/08	2001-02-21

Anita takes you on a journey through a woman's self-discovery as she struggles with her husband's death and the reality that she didn't know him like she thought she did. It is a portrayal of a strong woman who sets out to learn who her husband really was ~~ while at the same time working to protect her daughter and helping her through this trying time as well as exploring her self-realization. <br />It is a quick read as well as an engrossing one. Though the book doesn't stir up lots of debates like Oprah's other selections, the topic of adultery still hits too close to home. However, it is interesting to see how Kathryn deals with it during her grieving process and comes to the realization that none of us really know another person. This book may sound depressing, but it really isn't. You have to read between the lines to see that there is a gift of hope that Anita was trying to share with her readers as you grow along with Kathryn on her journey.	2001-02-21

I am not fond of Nancy and Noel ~~ two of her children who seems to expect too much from their mother, while Olivia is my favorite child ~~ she's so much like her mother except for being career-driven. She doesn't put many demands on her mother ~~ she's the daughter every mother wishes she has!<br />Pilcher writes convincingly of the human relationships between Penelope and her children as well as the other characters. She writes of ordinary lives transformed by love. Her descriptions of Cornwall are so vivid that you can almost see the breakers on the beach as well as smelling the salt in the air. It must be artists' paradise! <br />What captures my fancy is how Penelope is such a warm-hearted person who uses her inheritance to pay for a trip home. Too many people expect their parents to leave them money after they have gone, whereas Penelope spends her inheritance prudently and wisely. She has never followed the rules and she does it with so much grace and love ~~ it makes one want to be more like her instead of like two of her greedy children.<br />This book covers more emotions and depths of the human lives and these characters become as real as your family. It's a great summer read (or even a winter read ~~ with a pot of hot tea nearby and delicious scones!) and the characters will linger long after the last page is turned.	2001-02-21

This book is so wonderfully refreshing compared to a lot of novels today. It's a sequel of a sorts to &quot;The Shell Seekers,&quot; but the characters are different people than the ones that occupys &quot;The Shell Seekers.&quot; Only Noel is presented in this book and it's such a nice change to see him growing up into a real man throughout this book. If anyone can prove that they can redeem themselves, Noel is the best example of that! <br />Be sure to read this book right after you've finished &quot;The Shell Seekers.&quot; That way, Noel and his tendencies are still fresh in your mind and you can see Pilcher at work intertwining lives of people in both books. <br />Pilcher is an author I highly recommend to everyone to read. She's a clean writer, refreshingly so! Her descriptions of every day life in Scotland and England are vivid ~~ where you can see the loch in its glory on a fall day, smell the tea, see the rainy mists just outside the windows. She takes you with her on her journeys. And it lingers long after the last page.	2001-02-21

Going back and forth between the mother and the daughters can be a little confusing especially since it seems that Kingsolver has used different &quot;voices&quot; for each of her characters. The evangelist, Nathan Price, the husband of Orleanna, father of Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May, is a man of contradictions ~~ enough to be exasperated with him and typical of a lot of missionaries who only seek God's glory in the wrong ways. Orleanna seems to be a hen-pecked wife but she in turns discovers her strength when she needed it the most.<br />The daughters are interesting in their own way. My least favorite is Rachel for she never loses her spoilness and selfish ways. My favorite is Leah ~~ she didn't let anything stop her in the way of true love. Not even war, prison, hunger, broken dreams ~~ none of it stopped her from staying with her husband.<br />Kingsolver is consistent in one thing ~~ she is a writer who describes the surroundings in which her characters find themselves in. And you can feel the tropical heat of the jungle, see the insects, animals, hear the call of the monkeys and feel the humidity sticking to your skin. If you have time to read, then this is the book to read in slow spurts. Sometimes, it's all too much to handle in one sitting or even one week, but the ending does come. When I came to the end of the book, I felt a sense of relief that I was finally done. It isn't her best book ~~ Prodigal Summer more than makes up for what she didn't do in this book!!	2001-02-21

This is a thought-provoking book where it shows the darker side of Vivi's life ~~ why she turns to alcohol to escape from her sadnesses and frustrations. Though Vivi presents this happy, carefree person to the world, she deals with depression and a sense of loss throughout her whole life. She is not a happy person and though she tries to avoid it, it does affect the lives around her. <br />Rebecca Wells writes with humor and she touches in places that most women hide from the world ~~ even from their own families or those closest to them. This is a book for mothers and daughters to read for every daughter longs to know exactly what her mother is really like and every mother longs to remain the most important person in her daughter's life. Wells really explores the mother-daughter theme with grace and humor. It isn't a book easily forgotten.	2001-02-21

The setting in The Colony reminds me of the little village in Michigan by one of her numerous lakes ~~ where I had spent my summer vacation. The love, passion and friendships, complicated relationships span over the years and the ending is just as enthralling as the opening paragraph. You just don't want to put this book down. Out of all the Siddons books, this is the best written one.	2001-02-21

The author doesn't grab your attention by the horn, but slowly, softly does she tell her story between two cousins and the choices they have made with their lives. And she is excellent weaving two lives separated by different cultures and oceans. You can feel the hot air in India, being surrounded by jasmine and you can see New York through Indian eyes ~~ feeling the sense of freedom of being away from a different lifestyle.<br />Anju and Sudha are unforgettable characters ~~ each so different in her way and both strong women. They grew up closer than twins for they were always together, and the stories they tell to each other are exiquiste. Then marriage and their choices regarding their marriages only kept them apart for a while ~~ after all, they are sisters of the heart and nothing can really keep them apart. It makes one wish that they had a close relationship like theirs in their lives. They are so fortunate and yet so unfortunate.<br />I highly recommend this book. It is an easy read and the whispers that Divakaruni tells throughout the book isn't easily forgotten. This is the first book I've read by Divakaruni and she is an author I promise to read again. She makes you feel like you're sitting some place safe while someone you love most in this world is telling you secrets only for your ears. And that is the most delicious feeling ever to have in this lifetime. If an author can create that feeling with a book, then she is superbly talented.	2001-02-19

Dena, Norma, Macky, Gerry and other characters just revolved into fascinating people. <br />The book isn't hard to follow along despite the traveling back and forth over 40 years. And Dena is a character that is slightly unpredictable as you read along with her. Gerry though is my favorite character ~~ I cannot say why because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read this book.<br />This book arouses many emotions ~~ loathing, suspense, laughter and joy and sadness. It also promotes friendships, family, loyalty and so on. <br />This is a book to pass onto friends and families. The characters will stay with you long after you turn the last page. It is a fun book. You won't regret buying it.	2001-02-13

In my experience, this book has aroused many thought-provoking conversations between friends and families. The characters are vividly drawn and they arouse strong emotions ~~ either of hate or sympathy. And as you are reading this book, you begin to become drawn into the characters' lives. It is like walking into a fog because you don't know what to expect in the next page or even the next paragraph. And when I think of sand, I think of quicksand because of the troubles that surrounded the characters ~~ and how they chose to resolve their problems. <br />This book is graphically descriptive ~~ you can almost feel the breeze blowing through the windows, smelling the tangy sea air and feeling the thirst for a coke after a hangover. The author has done a real good job of drawing the reader into his private world and leaving them hanging page after page. <br />This is not my favorite Oprah's pick, but I am glad I read it. It is full of beauty and grace as well as sadness. You learn more about the human nature than you thought you would. And it is a great ice-opener at parties. People of all walks in life have different opinions about each of the characters, and it makes for a lively conversation.	2001-02-07

I would read a few pages a day, put it down for a week, then return to it only to put it down. The cycle repeats itself constantly till I gave up on the book. I have never once in my life not finish a book till this one. <br />What's wrong with it? Nothing major that you can pinpoint. The characters are depressing. Then Irving goes on and on about the realities of life in the 1800s. He also carried on about abortion ~~ giving too many graphic details. For someone who is pro-choice, all that information is just too much. Even the sex scenes were depressing. So I gave up on the book ~~ I reached a quarter of the way and decided it wasn't worth reading. I guess I do read to be informed, but not like that. <br />This is the first book I refused to finish and I am not about to read any of Irving's other books. I know that others rave about this book, but I just couldn't find anything positive about it! <br />Thumbs down, is my final review.	2001-01-27

I couldn't put this book down ~~ it was so hilarious and Tiffany's trials with the personals in finding Mr. Right hits the spot. I totally sympathize with her in her quest. The guys she meet are so-so, or delicious but they dump her for the ravishing girl next on the list and so forth. She falls in love with Seriously Successful ~~ can't spoil the ending for you. <br />I have never read any of Isabel Wolff's books and this one fits the modern, dating woman to a tee. Most women I know have dated guys only to groan that they will never find Mr. Right. I can relate to Tiffany as she sees her friends pair off ~~ after which she has helped interfere in some way to bring those people together. Tiffany is an outrageous but lovable character. <br />If you are blue or married but thinking the relationship is so staid, pick up this book. I guarantee that you will be thanking your lucky stars that you're not on a hunt for Mr. Right. However, if you are single, you can totally relate to Tiffany and how she has to go through all the Mr. Wrongs before she found love. Realistically, not all of us have dates every week nor have a job where our hours aren't set, but it's a fun book to read.<br />I highly recommend The Trials of Tiffany Trott.	2001-01-26

The Forest is a rich, vivid historical read ~~ with fiction intertwined with history of England's most lush forest. If you are a history buff, this book is a good read. It seems long but unlike &quot;London&quot;, this book didn't drag in some places. Keeping track of the families were easier this time for some reason. Maybe it's because after reading all of his books, you tend to get an idea of how he writes.<br />In my opinion, Rutherford gets better with every book, though &quot;Russka&quot; is still my favorite Rutherford book. Rutherford goes out of his way to find the little historical facts as well as the well-known ones. The characters are vividly drawn in their periods of time. The scenery is terrific ~~ the whole time I was reading this, it was below zero outside and all I could think of was hiding in the woods in the middle of summer to feel the breeze going through the treetops. <br />If you are looking for a long read during these cold winter nights, this book is a great bet. Just grab your glass of wine, a blanket and light the logs in your fireplace and settle down for a nice winter read. It's worth it.	2001-01-26

Well, maybe not. However, Daisy Fay is one of the most unforgettable characters in the history of books ~~ at least in my personal journey through book reading! She is hilarious and she tells you like it is.<br />There are several scenes in the book where you laugh out loud and you just have to share it with someone else. And the ending ... don't you just love a good story? <br />If you find yourself reading a dark and gloomy book, be sure to pick this one up. After reading it, you will find your outlook on life so much brighter and cheerful. Fannie Flagg is a master storyteller and though this is the only second book of hers that I have read, you can bet that I will read the rest of hers. <br />What is so memorable about Daisy Fay? Well, as a child of a broken home, she has managed to find humor in just about every situation of her life. She resists her mother's attempts to make her into a lady ~~ a secret desire just about every girl has ~~ and her father has always told her that he is so glad that he didn't have a son ~~ she was his heart. Daisy Fay captured a lot of hearts in this book and she is guaranteed to capture yours.	2001-01-26

It's not the best read which really disappointed me as I had been waiting for years to read this book. I also had a hard time reading it because of the lack of quotation marks, puncuations and so forth. I also lost track of who was who in the story. Otherwise, his description of Texas and Mexico, the lonely life as a cowboy, waxes lyrical. I would recommend this book for those who really likes cowboys and westerns. It just didn't appeal to me very much!	2000-12-26

You learn more about moths, birds, nature than you think you would from just a novel. And she entertwines the main characters beautifully ~~ making sure that you know just how important the characters are to each other, just as how the animals and insects need each other in order to survive. This novel is much more interesting than Poisonwood Bible (though I liked that one too!)and you can relate to the characters a little more realistically.<br />If you like birds, animals, insects or are environmentally-conscious, I highly recommend this book. It gives a fresh outlook on the ecological system in the midst of the Appalachian mountains. While reading this book, I long for the winter snows to be over so I can camp out in the midst of the woods in southeastern Ohio and listen for the birds' return. <br />Once again, Kingsolver produces a lyrical read ~~ and keeps you on tenderhooks till she wraps up the ending. It's a great book to read by the fireplace while it's snowing outside. And it's a great book to share with your friends.	2000-12-22

However, reading this book really made me realize that I am not the only one experiencing the same stuff as Cassie is undergoing. If I was in Cassie's shoes, I would have done the one thing right ~~ to protect something so precious. It also helps to know that I am not the only one who was fooled by appearances. Not everything that glitters turn out to be gold. Picoult dives right into the scenery and the characters have more life than you would think. It's not as poignant as her later books, but I really enjoyed this one. I couldn't stop turning the pages even though I figure that if Cassie goes back to Alex, it wouldn't stop. Picoult also gives her usual twist at the ending ~~ this time leaving it open for the imagination. Once again, I am not disappointed with Picoult's talent. Too bad all authors aren't as talented and brillant as she is.	2000-12-14

Jodi keeps you guessing all along even while she is developing the characters' potential for life. And once again, her ending leaves you guessing. Some people think ... oops! Almost spoiled the ending for you. Just pick it up and read it for yourself. The title alone speaks for the book. And remember, Jodi has a tendency to keep you on your toes and smack you on the side of your head with her surprise ending.	2000-12-14

I am so grateful to have this book ~~ I feel as if I know Tony, Charis and Roz as well as I know my best friends. Their shared jealousy and anger with Zenia is refreshingly honest. They remind me of three ladies sharing their stories with each other in mutual aggravation with the central character who flits in and out of their lives. Once you pick up this book, you won't be able to put it down. I know, I tried and couldn't.	2000-12-09

The only other Atwood book I've ever read was The Handmaid's Tale and when Blind Assassin came out, I swore I was going to read it. Thankfully I did because it is really a superb reading. Atwood doesn't disappoint. Not at all. Someone mentioned in one of my clubs that this book was really two stories entwined together throughout the book and I thought, oh geez, I'm going to have to do a lot of backtracking just to keep everything straight. Actually, it flows together beautifully with a twist at the ending ~~ almost as if Atwood was tying up the loose ends of the stories with a bow. You finish the book with a sigh and being totally amazed at Atwood's prowess with words. If you don't have a lot of interruptions, then take the time to savor her descriptions and her voices as a journey through someone's life. If you do have interruptions, reassure that you won't lose the thread of the storyline. You can pick up just where you left it at and become immersed into the story again. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone! You won't regret it. And Atwood has gained another devoted fan in me.	2000-11-29

I love reading historical fiction ~~ actually any kind of history and fiction makes it a lot easier to read than some of those tomes that doesn't instill life in your imagination. Woolfolk sure didn't disappoint here. Words fail to describe the experience I had with this book, so I suggest that you go and find out for yourself what a great novel this is. And while you're reading it, just remember one thing, we women have come a long ways since the Middle Ages, thanks to countless of other women and Joan who dared to follow their dreams ~~ at a great price for them. We the lucky ones shouldn't forget so easily.	2000-11-29

My favorite book by her is still The Colony, but Nora, Nora transported me away to the deep South as well. I read it in one sitting, while swinging on the porch swing drinking iced tea. It's a perfect book to read on the beach as well. If you're looking for something light to read, this one is it. It also has a bittersweet, happy ending to leave a smile on your face for rest of the day.	2000-11-25

It is a cleanly written novel with strong characters. And it is a quick read as well. If you are looking for a mystery novel written in New Orleans, then you must give this book a read. Once you start, you won't be able to put it down, so be sure that you have a couple of hours slotted away just to read this book. Both men and women would like this book ~~ the female characters are strong-willed women and yet still retain their feminity as well. It's a great stocking stuffer for the mystery-lover in you.	2000-11-21

Ok, someone told me that Rachel (the main character) tends to get really whiney and bratty. Well, I didn't find that at all. I can relate to Rachel with her insecurities and low self-esteem, and though I have never been a drug addict, I still know enough of the reasons why Rachel chose to escape into drugs. While Rachel is in the Cloisters, she still retains her sense of humor throughout one of the most painful periods in her life. Marian Keyes is one of the best modern-day fiction writers. She knows her readers and she knows the average woman with her insecurities and uncertainities. I have found myself laughing out loud in some places as I can relate so well Rachel. If you are a Bridget Jones fan, this one is even better. For one thing, it's longer and it's funnier and sad in some places. After all, who hasn't felt unattractive, fat and still lust after a man? Or have troubled relations with their parents and siblings? This book is a must read for women (and men if they can understand a woman's point of view!). It is a perfect book for those long dreary winter days. Not only is it poignant in some places, it is funny and it does have a happy ending. What more can a reader ask?	2000-11-21

It is one of the most lyrical reading I've done in a long while. The descriptions of the life then is very vivid ~~ I can almost smell the paint and see life viewed through the characters' eyes. Chevalier takes you on her journey through time and when you finished the book, you almost wish you weren't done. And it does take a few minutes to travel back to the 21st century ~~ so vivid is her description of life in Holland. I recommend it to anyone who has a few hours to spare to read and to daydream.	2000-11-15

It starts out a little slowly, and maybe the main character doesn't appeal to you. But if you read past the first few paragraphs, the story draws you into the beauty of Scotland in winter. It is a lovely book with a predictable ending, but you don't care. It's pure escapism and so enjoyable to read. I recommend it to anyone who needs something to read on a rainy or snowy day. It takes you away for a few hours into a different world and you come back cheered.	2000-11-13

Well, after reading the first paragraph, I must say, I was wrong. The words and stories of each of Jacob's women weave together into a beautiful tale. And Anita brought the past to life ~~ with its dusty reality, not this purified pretty version that the Bible gives out. (How can you really span a life story of one man and his family and not use up more than a thousand pages?) Anita writes about all points of views and shows the reality of life back then. She also writes about the enduring relationships women have with one another. This is one book I am planning to buy for my closest girlfriends as it celebrates friendship, love and family. And when I finished the book, I felt as if I lost a new set of friends. This book is well-written and embraces the reader into Dinah's life. And leaves the reader with haunting images from time past.	2000-11-12

I was totally caught unaware of the ending of this book ~~ and once again, Anne Rice surprises me! Last Rice book I read was Armand, which had a tendency to make me fall asleep. Merrick didn't. This book is such a lovely cross between the Mayfair witches and the Vampires. And reading it over a few foggy nights sure help set the mood for reading Merrick. I don't get scared very easily, but Rice's description of hunting for a long-lost mask is a little nerve-wracking. Her descriptions once again is very vivid ~~ I almost feel I was there. She is a little weak on the characters' interactions with each other ~~ she seems to have glossed over lots of meaningful conversations and focused too much on David, Louis and Merrick's physical beauty as well as their sexual attractions. But reading it makes up for those small deficiencies. I've always enjoyed Anne Rice's books and she didn't disappoint me on this book. It's not her best (The Witching Hour is much better), but it's not as bad as other fans seem to think. If you're looking for a good read, Merrick won't disappoint you there.	2000-11-06
