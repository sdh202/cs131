She is getting tired of receiving \\"inspirational\\" e-mails from Julie Singletree and is trying to think of a way to cut her out of the chain.  Just as she writes a tactful brushoff e-mail, Lee discovers that Julie has been murdered.  Full of self-reproach, Lee begins to do her own investigation and she discovers that other people in her e-mail group are having computers stolen or information erased.  A subplot in this book has to do with a disagreement on wedding plans between Lee and Joe.  Lee wants a small, simple wedding and Joe wants a big bash where he can invite all of his friends and family.  As usual, there is chocolate trivia interspersed throughout the book and the descriptions of the chocolates which are produced at Aunt Nettie's chocolate shop are enough to make your mouth water.  This is another enjoyable addition to the series.	2005-10-13

She enjoys working with her customers and tries to keep a stiff upper lip by staying involved with her friends and the community.  As always, she looks forward to Mardi Gras and she attends one of the parades which takes a frightening turn when one of the participants is murdered.  Shamus seems to have had motive and opportunity so the police zero in on him as their #1 suspect.  Despite the hurt she has suffered from Shamus, Carmela feels it is her duty to protect him by finding the real killer.  She checks out people who might have had a problem with the victim, and finally she discovers the truth.  This book has a few loose ends and doesn't do a very good job of explaining Carmela's feelings for Shamus, but all in all, it is a pleasant read.	2005-10-12

The featured couple in this book are Roy and Corrie McAfee who are receiving mysterious post cards from someone who forces them to look at their past.  At the same time their daughter Linnette is moving back to town and Corrie tries to introduce her daughter to a young man she wants her to date.  Olivia and Jack Griffin face a crisis in their marriage just as her mother Charlotte begins her new life with Ben Rhodes.  There are romances, pregnancies, and births among the younger set, and an unfortunate fire which destroys a Cedar Cove landmark.  Author Macomber does a good job of creating new situations for her characters and keeping up reader interest.  The next book in the series will be 6 Ranier Drive, which will feature Seth and Justine Gunderson.	2005-10-07

Not having gone through a similar experience, I had a hard time relating to this book.  I can only imagine that this would be a valuable tool for someone going through a dark time in their own lives.  Her suggestions about waiting for the Lord and resting in Him are valuable for all Christians and her point is well made that we try to make things happen according to our own agenda, instead of joining God in his almighty purpose.  This point is also made (more convincingly to me) in the book, \\"Experiencing God\\" by Henry Blackaby.	2005-10-05

In this installment, Father O'Malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the Arapahoe and Shoshone Indians has been re-ignited, and that dead Indians can be found on an ancient battle ground.  When Father O'Malley goes to investigate, he discovers three dead Shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles. Things heat up when the young Shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends.  Vicky Holden, the other main character in the series, has entered into a law partnership with Adam Lone Eagle, and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling.  Vicky wants to defend Frankie Montana, who is a suspect in the murders, and Adam tries to persuade her not to take Frankie as a client.  As always, author Coel creates a wonderful setting and characters, and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series.	2005-10-03

What's so amazing about grace appears to be that there is so little of it demonstrated in the world.  Although it is something which people hunger for, it is also something which we are reluctant to give.  Philip Yancey reminds us that God is the source of grace and Jesus is our earthly example.  Despite this, Christians are sometimes the last people to show grace to others. Yancey gives the reader numerous examples of grace in personal circumstances, and shows how it can heal relationships and encourage other people.  He also shows how Christians could be a positive influence in the area of government, but how we often miss the mark and become strident and legalistic in our demands.  He points out that the thing that sets the Christian religion apart from other religions is grace, and argues that if Christians exhibited more of this special quality, more people would be drawn to the church.  This is an inspiring and informative book which would be an asset to the library of any Christian.	2005-09-28

From the poignant opening moments when Ashima tries to make a palatable Indian-like dish from Rice Krispies and onions to the final moments, when she returns part-time to India, this book details the trials and heartaches of the immigrant experience.  Ashima is a partner in an arranged marriage and she travels to America to put her life and future in the hands of a man she hardly knows.  She works hard to keep Bengali customs alive in their home while making the necessary adapations to a new culture.  Her children are drawn to the ways of America, and quietly rebel against the old customs of their parents.  The story follows Gogol, the son, whose love affairs with women mirror the duality of his American/Bengali heritage.  Central to this struggle is his name Gogol which his parents call him at home and Nikhil, the name they give him when he goes to school.  The book uses the names interchangably, depending on which culture is the predominant one in his life at a particular time.  When his father dies, Gogol mourns, not so much at his passing, but at the missed opportunities to spend time with his father and give him the appreciation he deserved.  The book rings with truth, from the broad themes of clashing cultures and generations to the poignant details such as Gogol and his sister Sonia losing the train from their Monopoly game by dropping it accidentally into the heater.  The reader learns about many Bengali customs while at the same time vicariously living through the immigrant experience.  The people in this book are at first torn by the two cultures, but eventually they learn to make peace with both of them and to feel like whole and integrated people.  This is a book well worth reading.	2005-09-28

Tozer, a man who served as a pastor for 44 years without benefit of any college or seminary training.  Tozer discusses 10 of God's attributes, from his mercy and grace to his immensity and holiness.  In the back of the book, David Fessenden adds a study guide which can be used by an individual or by a group.  Tozer contends that our faith can only be as big as our God and he feels that we have \\"watered down\\" our Lord and as a result, we have also reduced out faith.  In each chapter Tozer tells the reader about one of God's characteristics, then defines it and discusses how this attribute effects the life of the believer.  In the process he answers questions such as \\"Why Are We Not Happy?\\" and shows us that God is perfect and infinite in every way.  God's Lordship derives not from what He does but in who He is, and Tozer does a good job of helping us understand that better.	2005-09-11

The first man to influence her was her father, who deserted her and her mother early in her life.  The role of father then fell to her beloved Uncle Charlie who was always nearby and was supportive of Bacall's efforts in life.  She dreamed early on of becoming an actress, but her chances of succeeding seemed rather remote.  After a few false starts in modeling and acting, she struck it big and became an overnight star at a very young age.  From then on she had many love affairs with men she admired, but none so important as her relationship with Humphrey Bogart.  Their 12 year marriage was filled with mutual admiration and love, which she never seemed to recapture after Bogie's death.  This is a fascinating story of a fascinating woman who has had to deal with her insecurities and the tug of work vs. family responsibilities in order to emerge as one of the premier actresses of our time.	2005-09-09

As she progressed through life, she looked for validation, through various causes and the many men with whom she had relationships.  Her three husbands, Roger Vadim, Tom Hayden, and Ted Turner, represent qualities she thought she was looking for, but at the same time they lacked some of the very qualities that she needed.  At this time in her life, Fonda feels that she no longer needs a man to validate herself and that she is more authentically herself than at any other time in her life.  (One can only hope that this is true!)   <br />At first I resisted reading this book because of the old \\"Hanoi Jane\\" memories and the chameleon-like and very public metamorphoses she has gone through in her lifetime.  When I finally decided to read it, I was very impressed with her candor and the honesty and humility with which she presents her weaknesses and failings.  I feel that she is still misguided in some of her thinking, and probably still too easily swayed to see one side of an issue, rather than both sides, but this book is very well-written and displays Fonda's intelligence and passion for life.  I wish her well on this final portion of her life's journey.	2005-09-03

When she discovers Korman's murdered body, she feels a sense of relief, although she worries about the effect his death will have on their son Arch.  Little does Goldy realize that her ex will come back to haunt her, when she is accused of his murder.  With a lifetime of Korman's shady dealings and a number of affairs, there's no lack of suspects in his murder.  It's up to Goldy and the police to find out which is the true murderer.  All of the usual characters are in this book--Goldy's long-suffering husband Tom, her best friend and fellow Jerk-hater Marla, and her son Arch.  With all of the red herrings in this book and people with motives it's a wonder that Goldy is able to solve the crime.  What is even more surprising is that Goldy and her family don't weigh 300 lbs. with all of the gourmet food that they keep preparing and eating!  This is another good read from author Davidson.	2005-08-27

Margaret Truman knows enough about the inner workings of the U.S. Government to make her Capital Crimes Novels ring true.  In this installment, a young writer named Richard Marienthal is eagerly looking forward to the publication of his novel which chronicles the revelations of a mob hit man named Russo.  Russo comes to Washington D.C. to testify at some hearings, but before he reveals anything, he is murdered.  Russo's information, which is also described in Marienthal's book, is potentially very damaging to the incumbent U.S. President, and to organized crime.  For Marienthal and his friends, it's hard to know who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  Marienthal still possesses the tapes which he used to write the book and he realizes that he and the tapes are in danger from several different people.  Not wishing to risk his life or that of his fiance, he has to make some difficult choices.  This is a good book and has a reasonable amount of suspense and intrigue.  The ending seems a bit too neat and sudden, but all in all, it is a good read.	2005-08-25

The cruise is postponed and more bad things begin the happen, from jewel thefts to more murders.  The passenger list consists of some very eccentric characters, from a wealthy dowager and her submissive daughter to a pair of hard-drinking amateur sleuths who help Judith and Renie solve the case.

Miss Julia and Sam Murdoch have eloped to the Smoky Mountains and have had a family honeymoon at Dollywood.  Unfortunately, there seems to be some doubt as to whether the wedding chapel preacher is really qualified to perform weddings.  Since proper behavior is #1 with Miss Julia, she tells Sam that they must have separate quarters until the marriage mystery is cleared up.  Meanwhile Hazel Marie, Miss Julia's erstwhile housemate, is involved in a beauty pageant which will raise money for the sheriff's department.  She, Miss Julia, and the flirtatious Etta Mae Wiggins, are in charge of the pageant and the contestants, a rag-tag group of six girls which present a real challenge to their mentors.  This book is not quite as much fun as its predecessors in the series, because of Miss Julia's unfounded concerns about Sam's fidelity and whether he truly wants to be married to her.  Otherwise, it's the usual romp with the characters which have become to beloved in the other books.	2005-08-19

Hazel Marie is on a date with a church fundraiser and fails to show up back at their house.

They are not yet married and they each live in their own homes with some of their children and grandchildren.  One night when they find themselves miraculously alone, Romeo attempts to carry Julie up the stairs to the bedroom where he suffers an injured back.  Julie's home becomes a 3-ring circus for the next several months with Romeo bed-ridden with a bad back and Julie's daughter coming to be taken care of before the birth of triplets.

All of the favorite characters are here, such as Arch and Julian, and a few new ones are added.  This is another good entry in this consistent series.	2005-08-02

Jance masterfully weaves two plot lines in this, her latest J.P. Beaumont book.  The first plot has to do with a nun who is beginning to remember that she was the witness to a murder when she was a 5-year-old girl.  Her memory is being encouraged by a hypnotherapist who comes to Beau for his help on the police aspects of the case.  The second plot has to do with Beau's old friend and former partner Ron Peters, whose ex-wife has just been killed.  Both Ron and his daughter Heather are implicated in the murder, and Beau is determined to find the real killer.  Mercifully these two plots never intersect, but instead run as two separate stories which are skillfully told in one book.  Many of Beau's friends and some of his enemies show up in the novel, along with a relatively new character whose presence promises some romance for the aging lawman.  Jance fans will be pleased by this entry in the series.	2005-07-31

Her next job is as an assistant to her Uncle Dante who is promoting the First Annual Route 66 Yard Sale which has 100-miles of continuous sales in small communities along the old Route 66.

His letters to his family, particularly his wife Abigail, as well as letters to other public figures form a basis for the writing of this book.  It is fascinating to read his public writings in light of the happenings of his time, and then read his private letters which reveal candidly his true thoughts. <br />Adams was a consummate New Englander--thrifty, hard-working, and very much involved in life around him.  He would have happily remained a farmer, but for the events which swirled around him.  He could not stand by and watch the British bully America, and he was one of the earliest and strongest proponents of independence.  When the war was won, Adams continued his public life as a diplomat in France, the Netherlands, and England.  His dogged determination and a refusal to compromise his integrity sometimes got him into trouble with foreign governments, but his judgment was usually proven to be correct.  His relationships with other notables of the Federalist period, especially Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, were fascinating.  Though his absences from home were long and difficult, he maintained a loving relationship with his wife Abigail, and took one or the other of his sons with him on his government assignments, when possible.  His eldest son, John Quincy, especially thrived by being a close observer to important historical events and people.  This later served him well when he was elected the sixth U.S. President.  Although sometimes the details in the book become a little tedious, overall this is a most interesting read.	2005-07-27

The followers of the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency should be delighted with this latest entry in the series.  All of the favorite characters are here along with two new ones--a man just out of jail who becomes an employee of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and Mma. Ramotswe, and a shy, awkward man whom Mma Makutsi meets at dance school.  There are lots of amusing subplots including a mysterious intruder, a watermelon from an unknown source, Charlie the apprentice consorting with a rich, older woman, a missing Zambian businessman, and the disappearance of Mma Ramotswe's white van.  A major twist concerns a secret which Precious has guarded even against her husband.  With his usual style and grace, author Smith manages to untangle these many situations and to create an eminently satisfying read.	2005-07-21

He did his job, which included giving the signal for executions to take place, while inwardly questioning the humanity of capital punishment.  This is a fascinating story of a man who began his career in the prison system as a part-time guard, trying to earn some money for college.  He fully intended to leave after graduation, but somehow he never did and as the years went by and the promotions came, he continued in the work for which he seemed so well-suited.  This book is written in the first person and this adds to the immediacy of the description of prison life and the relations between prisoner and prison employee.  The stories which are told in this book show the depths to which human beings can go and also the common humanity which binds us together.  This is a fascinating and well-written book.	2005-07-19

Of course, it's all about money and power, and the old guard having to put up with social interaction with the nouveau riche whose social skills have not quite caught up with their financial well-being.  Central to the plot are Elias and Ruby Renthal whose somewhat shady backgrounds at first scandalize the established social gentry, but who eventually become social scions by virtue of their lavish parties and improved manners.  Woven among the phony, materialistic values are a few characters who show refreshingly genuine emotions of love and selflessness.  This is an interesting study of a group of people who indeed have more money than sense.	2005-07-17

The initial descriptions of the four people--two recently released convicts, a woman whose husband has committed suicide, and a police officer--are interesting and promise an intriguing story.  Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from there.  The characters are manipulated in an artificial manner, and the interactions are forced and wooden.  I agree that the writing is surprisingly amateurish at times and a good editor would have caught the awkward phrasing and helped improve it.  This is not Danielle Steele's best work!	2005-07-15

It is about Caroline Hartzinger, a young half-Jewish woman whose family is being threatened by the Nazis, but who manages to escape to America.  She is betrayed by her lover who deserts her during her pregnancy, but is married to a kind man who wishes to give Caroline's baby legitimacy.  The book details the life of Caroline, her daughter Eve, and her granddaughter Jane, all of whom are profoundly effected by the betrayal of Caroline's lover.

Plum's love interests, Ranger and Joe Morelli, are very much in evidence and Stephanie has fun trying to juggle the two men in her life without them knowing what she is doing.  Lula, the overweight Spandex Queen takes over Stephanie's job and has some unusual techniques for doing her bounty hunting.  Grandma Mazur is still hanging out at the funeral home and is as feisty as ever.

He finally gets the opportunity and in the process he learns a lot about himself, life, and family expectations.  Adriana Trigiani is one of my favorite authors and in this book she creates another madcap, loving, eccentric Italian family who provide the background for the story.  Barolomeo's sister Toot is a particularly memorable character, but the reader will also love and laugh along with many of the other characters.  This is a rolicking, funny, feel-good read which I heartily recommend!	2005-06-27

The book is all about small-town life in the South and is a tongue-in-cheek look at the attitude that appearances are everything.  Miss Julia is approached by Dwayne Dooley who wants to lease some land that she owns in order to build a Walk Where Jesus Walked theme park.  Although her Presbyterian sensibilities are riled by the thought of commercializing Christianity, Miss Julia agrees that this is a good business deal and decides to go through with it.  Meanwhile, scandals abound as several prominent citizens are observed in highly questionable situations and the women of the town are quite happy to jump to all sorts of nefarious conclusions.  Added to this, Miss Julia's boyfriend Sam Murdoch tries his best to convince her to marry him.  It's all in good fun and makes for an enjoyable read.	2005-06-23

This is her first book which was published in 1987, and it tells about a portion of her spiritual journey.  She was a young woman who was all too typical of today, a person who tried to be perfect in every aspect of her life.  She rushed around baking homemade cookies for every event imaginable, being in charge of several events and ministries in her church, and trying to be the perfect wife and mother.  She tried to earn God's love by being the best that she could be and by constantly doing good works.  As a result, she wore herself out and began having physical symptoms of the stress she was under.  She learned the hard way that it was better to be in fellowship with God rather than rush around earning his favor by works.  This is the story of her metamorphosis from an over-stressed wife, mother, and church worker to a true daughter of God who learned to slow down, accept God's love and revel in his presence.  There is much to be learned in this book by all Christians who wish to have a closer walk with God.	2005-06-20

Her mother has inexplicably cut off her finger and Jessie's aunt is understandably concerned.  Jessie returns reluctantly and finds her mother to be remote and confused, but she refuses to accept help from her husband Hugh.  She finds herself drawn into old memories of her childhood, including the painful ones surrounding the death of her father in a boat explosion.  Her mother lives next door to a monastery and sometimes cooks for the monks, so it is only natural that Jessie meets Father Thomas, one of the monks.  The feelings which they develop for one another become stronger and Jessie soon finds herself struggling with decisions about how and with whom she will spend the rest of her life.  Sue Monk Kidd has an amazing way of sprinkling her narrative with beautiful imagery and of weaving mystical tales among the more realistic elements of her story.  The relationships between Jessie, Father Tom, Hugh, and Jessie's mother are all developed with sensitivity and insight and are at the center of the story.  Jessie makes mistakes and causes and experiences pain, but after all, isn't that how life is?  This is a wonderful tale of love, healing, and redemption	2005-06-12

Author Thayer minces no words when she describes the physical, mental, and emotional problems of growing older, but what her characters realize is that any problem is easier if it is shared with sympathetic friends.  Faye is a lonely widow who is concerned about her daughter's marriage, Shirley is an aging flower child with an unfulfilled dream, Marilyn is an academic who has given up on love and romance, and Alice is a type-A personality whose self-esteem is tied up with her successful career.

Things become even more complicated when the fifth member of the team, a woman named Kate, shows up on the Island, and there are now two people to protect.

She was not particularly interested in hearing family stories until 1995, when she quit a lucrative job and begin researching the Louisiana plantations along the Cane River where her ancestors were slaves.  What she discovered among family papers and oral history was the impetus for this novel.  She chose to present it as fiction, but it is based squarely on the real lives of real people, who seem to be representative of a lifestyle in the American South in the early and mid-1800's.  The book chronicles the lives of the strong women who preceded Lalita Tademy in her family line.  They were women who did whatever was necessary to survive and to provide a better life for their children.  Each of these women bore illegitimate children fathered by the Creole plantation owners along the Cane River.  The men loved their children, and tried to provide for them, but the laws and social customs of the day did not allow interracial marriage or the transfer of property from white fathers to black children.  After so many years of producing half-white children, Tademy's family could have passed as white, but almost all of them chose not to.  I was totally captivated by the stories of these women, and I learned a lot about a very unjust time in our country's history.	2005-05-29

Her husband Gabe, the local sheriff, and her friend Hud, a police investigator, implore Benni to let them solve the murder, but as usual, she does her own investigating.  She discovers that one of her child actors may have been a witness to the murder and Benni fears for the child's life.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the strength of this series lies in the relationships between the characters.  Earlene Fowler is wise enough to realize the complexities which can exist in a marriage and the tension between the two strong leading characters, Benni and her husband Gabe, prove to be the impetus for their character development.  Fowler always manages to reveal a new facet to the personalities and pasts of Benni and Gabe in each book.  The one aspect of this book which disappointed me was that I was able to guess who the murderer was about halfway through.  Regardless, this is another very good entry in the series.	2005-05-24

When the resort's chef disappears, caterer Faith takes over and her vacation is essentially over.  Another dead body shows up and no one knows who to trust.  Author Page does a good job of portraying the difficult relationships which can occur when an extended family gets together for an long period of time.  Her choice of a Vermont ski lodge as the setting of the book is also a good one.  Her portrayals of the teenagers and the strange woman who lives in a \\"gingerbread house\\" in the middle of the woods are less believable.

After the recent death of Nick's wife, his young son Lucas has gone off the rails and is repeatedly suspended from school.  Added to this someone seems to be stalking him and is entering his home to spray graffiti messages about Nick having no place to hide.  As if this isn't bad enough, Nick's employees are working behind his back to sell the company to a group in China.  Eventually the stalker enters Nick's yard, and a tragedy ensues.  Finder spends the rest of the book tangling these plots tightly around his hero.  My only objection to the book is the easy \\"feel-good\\" ending, but up to that time it is a very good read.	2005-05-12

The reader is given an inside look at Afghan culture, including the delightful description of the kite-flying contest in which the last one with a kite in the air is the winner and the kites which are cut and fall to the ground are prized possessions for the \\"kite runners\\".  A tragic and violent incident brings on the heavy, main part of the meal, and the lives of the two boys are changed forever.  Unspeakable guilt and long-kept secrets work to undermine the happiness of the main characters.  The dessert is the sweetness of repentance and redemption, which comes at great cost to some of the characters.  The author uses the background of 30 years of political unrest in Afghanistan as a setting for characters whose lives are likewise torn up and re-invented.  This is a wonderful book which I highly recommend.	2005-05-04

The donation does not come without some stipulations, as the first production is a play written by Jane Obermann, which traces the history of her family.  Much to Jane's chagrin, the cast and director take some \\"poetic license\\" and the play when produced is a little different from the way it was written.  On a more serious note, the sisters hire China's husband Mike McQuaid to protect them from their handyman, Hank, who has been threatening them.  Soon Hank breaks into their house and is shot dead by Jane, an obvious case of self-defense.  Meanwhile China's stepson, Brian, has become interested in archaology and he discovers an old skeleton in a cave where he is doing some work.  These seemingly disparate incidents are brought together as a result of investigation done by China and her friend Sheila who is the town sheriff.  This is another interesting mystery written by Susan Wittig Albert who manages to mix in some interesting facts about herbs with her stories about China.	2005-04-29

When he arrives, he meets the town librarian, Lexie Darnell, who soon lets him know that she has been hurt by romances in the past and she refuses to get involved with a big-city man such as himself.  They spend the rest of the book falling in love and trying to resist each other because they are so different and they lead very different lives.  Usually the best part of Nicholas Sparks novels is the depth of his characters, but somehow Jeremy and Lexie don't become as well-developed or as loveable as many characters in Sparks' other books.  He has written some memorable books with somewhat tragic endings, but this book is all fluff and not much substance.  Hopefully Sparks will return to what he does best in the future.	2005-04-22

I realize I am going against the grain of 99% of those who have written reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Rebecca Wells recaptures the spirit and spontaneous craziness of the four life-long friends, and fills in a few blanks in our knowledge, such as how the girls met and became friends in the first place. It might have been better if this book had been marketed as a group of short stories because, although there are some ties between chapters, most of the stories stand alone.  I laughed out loud at some of the adventures of the Ya-Yas and their progeny and the book evoked the same sense of enjoyment I felt at being let in on their world in the first two books.  This is not a novel in the conventional sense, but it does bring the reader back to the world of these four unconventional women and the friendships which sustain them throughout their lives.	2005-04-20

In this novel, his main character is William Henry Devereaux, Jr., who is the interim English department chairman at an obscure university in Pennsylvania.  He is a totally irreverant man who aggravates his fellow academicians and his family with a sharp wit which is aimed at anyone who happens to be near him.  His patient, long-suffering wife Lila goes off on an interview, with the dire prediction that he will end up in the hospital or jail while she is gone.  Wrong!  He ends up BOTH in the hospital and in jail.  The situations that he finds himself in are hilarious, but underneath there is some serious business going on.  He fears for his health (much time is spent musing on an imagined kidney stone) tries to ignore his father who has returned after a lifetime of infidelity to his mother, and ponders the many questions of a man in mid-life crisis.  Russo creates a world that is humorous enough to keep the reader amused, yet real enough to ponder seriously.  He is a writer worth reading.	2005-04-07

Nevada Barr has flirted with the dark side of human nature in her previous books, but in this entry, the dark side predominates.  Anna Pigeon is called to be district ranger at Rocky Mountain National Park a mere 3 days after she marries Sheriff Paul Davidson.  Of pressing concern is the disappearance of three young girls who are members of a religious cult.  When two of the girls return, they will not speak of what has happened to them, claiming amnesia.  The girls are discovered by Heath, a former climber who has become wheelchair-bound as the result of an accident, and her Aunt Gwen.  The girls bond with Heath and Gwen but refuse to tell them what has happened.  Anna begins her investigation with the girls' families, who are strangely intertwined by seemingly-polygamous arrangements.  (Why is it that religious people are so often depicted as wild-eyed radicals in novels?)  This is just the tip of the iceburg, as there are hints of terrible things going on in the park.  Animal sacrifices and ritual slayings are just a few things that Anna discovers on her way to the truth.  I agree that the situations in this book go over the top and I hope that Nevada Barr will return to books that are more entertaining and less horrifying.	2005-04-04

She writes a play which she plans to produce for the homecoming of her older brother Leon, with the help of her cousins as cast members.  Things go awry and the play is never put on, but a drama of a bigger sort takes place instead.  Briony is the witness of two events between adults at her home, and her young age and impressionable nature keep her from interpreting the events correctly.  She claims to have seen someone committing a crime, which causes him to be sent to jail, although he is completely innocent.  The book then switches to graphic scenes of wartime, as Briony searches for atonement for her crime.  Through beautiful prose and wonderful character development, the author spins a tale which explores the possibilities of forgiveness, and the terrific responsibilities of writers whose words will invariably influence the thoughts and attitudes of others.  This book is not for everyone.  Be advised that the narrative moves slowly and it's not until the very end that issues are resolved.  For me, the book was enjoyable and the brilliant ending justified the slow pace of the story.	2005-04-01

First is Victoria Roubideaux, a young high school girl who is pregnant and has no place to go.  Then there is Guthrie, a high school teacher, and his two boys Ike and Bobby whose mother stays in bed most of the time and eventually leaves the family.  Guthrie has a friend named Maggie Smith, who is also a teacher, and the final two characters are the McPherons, two bachelor brothers who run a farm outside of town.  The author titles his chapters with the names of these characters and gently weaves a story about their everyday lives.  His prose is simple and spare, and he does not even include quotation marks when his characters are speaking.  There are several situations which are never really explained nor are they resolved, and I found this frustrating as a reader.  The strength of the book is in the characters, but the plot lacks structure and closure.	2005-03-29

However in \\"Prep\\", Curtis Sittenfeld accomplishes just such a feat.  Her brilliantly-drawn character is Lee Fiora, a bright young girl from South Bend, Indiana, who feels that she will do much better in a boarding school than in her local public high school.  She convinces her parents that this is the road she should take, and when she is accepted as a scholarship student at Ault, she eagerly takes the position.  The next four years consist of unending misery for Lee, as she continually measures herself against others and always finds herself lacking.  She becomes a veritable recluse while she \\"toughs out\\" the four years of high school, while attempting to be as invisible as possible.  Even when others reach out to her in friendship, she finds it impossible to reciprocate.  Only a kind girl named Martha can get through her shell, and they spend their last three years as roommates.  Lee becomes obsessed with having a boyfriend, yet she always seems to sabotage any efforts that boys make to befriend her.  She finally centers her obsession on a boy named Cross, and predictably this relationship is doomed from the start.  Sometimes Lee can be maddeningly self-destructive, but whataver her reactions to the situations around her, she comes across as an honest portrayal of an unhappy, self-conscious teenager who is just trying to surivive in a demanding and difficult situation.  I am very much looking forward to this author's second novel.	2005-03-27

The heroine is Dorothea Granger who lives with her parents on her uncle's farm.  Her father's farm was swept away in a flood and Uncle Jacob took in his sister and her family, when they had nowhere else to turn.  Jacob is a harsh man and Dorothea's family lives uneasily under his strict rules, hoping that someday the farm will be left to her brother Jonathon, who is studying to be a doctor.  Dorothea is not married, but one of the young men in the area shows a lot of interest in her.  Their relationship is marred by the fact that their families stand on opposite sides of the Abolition question.  The Grangers are steadfastly in favor of Abolition and they befriend their black neighbors, some of whom are former slaves.  As the book continues, the tensions rise, until people's lives are put in jeopardy.  As usual, author Chiaverini spins an interesting story with well-drawn characters and a plot in which a quilt plays a major part.	2005-03-24

Jeff Abbott is a Texas author who can really write an exciting novel, with well-drawn characters and a plot which twists and turns often enough to satisfy almost any reader.  In this book, Judge Whit Mosley decides to track down his long-absent mother in order for her to explain the desertion of her family to Whit's dying father.  In the years since she walked out on her husband and six sons, Ellen Mosley has transformed herself into a member of the mob, living in Houston and specializing in money laundering for her boss, Tommy Bellini.  As Bellini lays dying, his son Paul manages to make the family vulnerable to attacks from the outside.  He bungles a drug deal and ends up without the drugs or the money.  Ellen, who is now called Eve, is implicated in the robbery of Paul's money, but she is innocent.  What then transpires is too complicated to try to describe, but basically all of the bad guys are trying to end up with the drugs AND the money.  Whit stumbles into this situation and is soon entangled in illegal activities which threaten his career and his mother's life.  Abbott manages to untangle the complicated situation at the end and to create an interesting story along the way.	2005-03-22

Julian is heartbroken and Goldy is determined to find out who is responsible for Claire's death.

Only three remain--Julia, a lobsterman named Noah, and a young woman who has been rendered mute by the trauma of the accident.  As a result of this near-death experience, Julia reasseses her life and her role as the family doormat.  This is a solid premise and holds the potential to be a good book, but somehow the author never really engages the reader or makes these characters deep enough to be highly valued.

They start off with shared custody until they see that shuffling Tommy back and forth is causing a strain on him and they revert to having him live with his mother most of the time, with frequent visitation from his father.  They work together to help Tommy through the aftermath of the divorce and then again collaborate to counsel their average-student son into the college application process.  They keep their cool, do everything right, and are sure that Tommy is doing fine.  When he goes off to college and encounters problems, they are in denial and don't want to think that their divorce has anything to do with it.  Author Corman writes convincingly and sensitively about an all-too-relevant subject for today's world.  A pertinent question seems to be, if these well-educated and well-grounded parents do everything right for their child and he still has problems, what is happening to families where the parents are not as well-equipped to handle trauma?

As she frantically searches for her true self, she ignores the life that is all around her until her octagenarian roommate, Poppy, sets her straight.  This is an interesting novel with several universal themes and well-drawn characters.  It moves slowly at times, but is certainly worth the read.	2005-02-22

After many years as a marriage counselor, Gary Chapman began noticing patterns in the way couples interact with each other.  Although one or both partners might be trying to please their mate and make their marriage better, somehow their efforts were falling short.  He noticed that after the first blush of romantic love begins to fade, couples are often unsuccessful in keeping the loving and affectionate feelings alive in their marriage.  He concluded that each of us has a \\"love language\\", which is based on a need within us which must be filled in order for us to feel loved.  This love language is part of us early in life and seems to continue to adulthood.  In order for us to effectively love our spouse, we must be tuned in to his/her \\"love language\\".  The love languages include quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, and physical touch.  Often people intuitively know which is their love language but for those who don't, Gary Chapman provides a questionnaire which will help each person identify which one is primary for him/her.  He has a chapter explaining each love language and how you can speak this language to your spouse.  If both partners are committed to making their marriage better, Chapman's case studies show this is an effective way for them to minister to each other and improve their communication and interactions.	2005-02-20

Melvin Stolzfus, the chief of police, decides to quit and asks Magdalena to solve the murder.  As she interviews those closest to Reverend Schrock, she discovers that he was practicing many of the sins that he preached against.  She is shocked and dismayed, and she begins to realize that many people had a grudge against Schrock and were glad to see him dead.  Before the madcap bed-and-breakfast owner is through with her investigation, she uncovers many closely-guarded secrets in the tightly-knit Mennonite community, some of which concern those nearest and dearest to Magdalena herself.  Fans of this series are in for a surprise when they read this latest in the Pennsylvania Dutch Mystery Series.	2005-02-18

Janet Evanovich has spoiled her readers with her Stephanie Plum Series in which the madcap bounty hunter never fails to amuse, amaze and entertain the reader.  This series seems pale by comparison, starting with the tepid heroine, Jamie Swift, and her too-rich-to-be believable boyfriend, Max Holt.  In this 4th. book of the series, Jamie's newspaper has just begun a want-ads section for the romantically-challenged.  A murder occurs and a copy of the ads is found near the victim.  The police immediately decide that the killer must be one of the men who put an ad in the paper.  Jamie feels guilty because the ads were her idea, so she calls in the intrepid Max to help her solve the murder.  It's amazing that he has the time to run a multi-million dollar corporation while chasing Jamie around her apartment and helping her put out the paper and solve a mystery.  Of course, there is his car computer which talks and hands out advice, as well as a visiting psychic called Destiny, a dog named Fleas and..........are you beginning to get the picture?  My advice is to skip this series and go to the Stephanie Plum books which are Vintage Evanovich.	2005-02-17

Apparently it takes an obsessive personality, a lot of money, and an unrelenting competitive spirit.  Mark Obmascik captures all of this in his book which features the top 3 birders in the 1998 competition.  The birders are as different as they are interesting.  Sandy Komito is a former Big Year winner, Al Levantin is a retired CEO who lives in Aspen, and Greg Miller is a computer programmer who attempts to work full-time while doing a Big Year in his \\"spare time\\".  Author Obmascik follows them all over North America, from the mosquitos of the Florida Everglades to the blinding snow storms of the remote island of Attu, and chronicles their successes, struggles, and failures.  Adverse weather conditions, only an advantage to birders, allow these three men to tally huge numbers of birds.  The book contains a lot of interesting birding history, insider practices, and a lot of laughs which make this a delightful read.	2005-02-16

She takes advantage of living by a pool and begins swimming every night.  She meets the handsome pool man and falls in love.  From then on it's a wild ride with Charlotte living her dream life while the officials in New Hampshire are in hot pursuit.  The whole concept of this book is delightful and though the writing is a little uneven in spots and the story turns out to be too good to be true, it's still an entertaining read.

Lydia Hoffman is a two-time cancer survivor who decides to open a Yarn Shop as a symbol of her new life.  Jacqueline Donovan joins Lydia's beginning knitting class, but has a hard time fitting in with some of the other women, due to her haughty and superior attitude.  Carol Girard is a woman who is desparate to have a baby and she thinks that if she joins the knitting class and makes a baby blanket, that will be a good omen for her goal of motherhood.  Alix Townsend seems like a real misfit when she joins the group.  She is a tough young woman who has grown up on the streets and she is particularly prickly with the aristocratic Jacqueline.  As usual, Debbie Macomber mixes these disparate characters together and somehow manages to \\"knit\\" them together in a lasting friendship.  This is an enjoyable and easy read.	2005-02-10

This book introduces Cayboo Creek, South Carolina, and its entertaining residents.  It centers around Elizabeth who works at the Bottom Dollar Emporium along with owner Mavis and the elderly but spunky Attalee.  The introduction of the new Super Saver Dollar Store chain to Cayboo Creek is a real threat to the survival of Bottom Dollar.  The town is just not big enough to support two similar stores.  Another plot thread involves the love-life of Elizabeth, who has almost given up hope of meeting her Prince Charming.  The author's tongue-in-cheek wit and the charm of her characters are a winning combination.  The \\"mystery\\" of Elizabeth's parentage is pretty transparent, but nevertheless the book has a heart-warming ending.  I look forward to the second book in the series.	2005-02-08

All of this becomes more complicated, however, when Aubrey Andrews Armstong, a supposed Hollywood producer, comes to town to investigate the possibility of making a movie based on a book written by Maia Michaelson, a local woman.  Lee knows that Maia is not a very good writer, and is suspicious of Aubrey's motives.  She becomes even more unhappy when if appears that Aubrey is attempting to romance Lee's Aunt Nettie.  As if this isn't bad enough, Joe begins to pressure her about helping him make  <br />choices in redecorating his apartment, so that she will be more eager to marry him and move in with him.  Needless to say, many chocolate bonbons and quite a bit of action later, Lee manages to get some answers to these problems.  I especially enjoy the setting of these books because it is close to my hometown and is an area with which I am very familiar.  This is an enjoyable series and is one that I look forward to reading more of in the future.	2005-02-06

They are puzzling over the death of one of their guests who turned out to be one of Bob's fellow servicemen during his tour of duty in Viet Nam.  He and Bob shared a terrible secret and Bob is afraid that his life may be in jeopardy too.  Woven into this mystery are the everyday relationships of the people in the town--newlyweds Olivia and Jack Griffin, about-to-be-wed Jon Bowman and Maryellen Sherman, the widowed Grace Sherman and her love interests, and Olivia's mother Charlotte who has a new male friend.  As usual author Debbie Macomber keeps all of these threads going as she weaves them into an interesting plot.  The setting is a beautiful seacoast town near Seattle, but the real draw is the interesting cast of characters who continue to develop as the series progresses.	2005-02-04

Police soon hear that it is the super-villain named Wolf who is responsible.  He teams up with another nemesis of Alex Cross, named The Weasel, to hold the world hostage by threatening to bomb four major cities unless there is a huge ransom paid and political prisoners are released.  Alex embarks on a world-wide chase of the criminals and even ends up being kidnapped and hand-cuffed to a bomb.  The final fate of the villains is not nearly as exciting as the efforts it takes to catch them.  There are several red herrings, and people mistakenly identified as Wolf along the way.  The ending is not even conclusive and leaves the door wide open for a sequel.  There are lots of good action scenes and some enjoyable interaction between Alex and his family and girlfriend, but in an attempt to make each of these books bigger, better and more exciting, Patterson seems to fall a little flat in this one.	2005-02-02

Olivia's mother Charlotte meets an interesting man and they soon find themselves in a protest march together.  The death of a mysterious man in a local bed and breakfast is never completely resolved and it leaves some unfinished business to be tackled in book #4 of the series.

Having no family left in Colorado, she seeks to do something special as her beloved grandmother predicted she would.  She finds life difficult because of inclement weather and a lack of conveniences, but the biggest problem she faces is that of prejudice.  She seeks to teach and befriend all of the people in the small town of Chicken, Alaska, where she lives but she soon discovers that her kindness towards Indian children raises the ire of the white people in the town.  She has to face up to the local school board and the town's people before she is allowed to teach Indians in her school.  As if that isn't bad enough she ends up falling in love with a \\"half-breed\\" and adopting some mixed-race children.  This book is full of adventure and real insight into what it was like to live in Alaska in the 20's.  It is also a triumphant story of one woman's love and her persistance in encouraging justice in her small Alaska town.	2005-01-27

The highlighted character is Grace Sherman, Judge Olivia Lockhart's best friend, who waits in vain for the return of her husband Dan, who has disappeared without a trace.  Grace is convinced that Dan is with another woman so she relutantly divorces him, much to the joy of Cliff Harding, who makes no secret of the fact that he would like to pursue a relationship with her.  Other main characters who appear are Seth and Justine, who marry at the end of book 1; Jack who is pursuing Olivia; Stan, Olivia's husband, who is having marital problems with his second wife; and MaryEllen, Grace's single daughter who becomes pregnant.  Macomber weaves these characters in and out of her story, and unlike many of the reviewers, I enjoy the simultaneous story lines.  After awhile these characters seem like old friends, and I look forward to re-visiting them in other books in the series.	2005-01-25

Author Mark Haddon shows an uncanny knack of getting inside the boy's head and relating things from his black-and-white world.  His world must be orderly or Christopher has a hard time functioning.  He does advanced math problems in his head in order to calm down in stressful situations.  He is presented with a lot of stress when his parents disappoint him, each in a different way.  He feels forced to make his way across England on his own to elude perceived danger and he overcomes situations which are fraught with frustration for him.  His parents show a lot of compassion at times, but his idiosyncrocies sometimes get the best of them.  This is an amazing book, which probably shows the reader more about the way an autistic person thinks than would many textbooks on the subject.	2005-01-23

Things are going his way until he gets in over his head and tries to sell a computer program that can control the satellites put up by other countries.  He's not too fussy about his clients and he gets in trouble by playing one country against another.  He goes to jail which serves as protection for him against his enemies.  When a badly defeated president is about to leave office, he is persuaded to grant Backman a pardon so that the U.S. can observe who tries to kill him and thus answer some questions about the satellite deal.  Backman is whisked away to Italy where the plans are to shield him from his enemies temporarily and then turn him loose so that they can observe him and his stalkers.  Rather than be a sitting duck, Backman decides to elude his \\"keepers\\" and strike out on his own.  This book has an interesting setting and a lot of intrigue woven into a fast-moving plot.  This is an enjoyable read, but I had a hard time with the main character who is portrayed as a contrite man when he is in Italy, but who reverts to being an arrogant person when he returns to Washington.  Having been described in villifying terms at the beginning of the book, Backman does a lot of personality flip-flopping before the end of the book.	2005-01-21

The method of each killing is copied from classic cases in the past.  Meanwhile the two sleuths are hired to defend a man who is being accused of burglary by the Battles, a wealthy, though dysfunctional family.  As in most books of this genre, the two cases begin to merge as the victims are shown to have some relationship to the Battles.  Author Baldacci takes the reader through the thought processes of the depraved killer, never hinting at his identity.  The suspense builds until at last the killer is caught, but Baldacci has a few more tricks up his sleeve before the books ends.  The author's technique of using short chapters only enhances the suspense which the plot creates.  I had a hard time putting this one down.	2005-01-18

However, Alexandra Barnaby makes it easier by her wise-cracking, tough, yet vulnerable persona.  The adventure begins when Alex receives a call from her brother Bill, saying that he'll be out of town for a while and not to worry.  Of course Alex is worried to the point that she gets on a plane and flies from her Baltimore home to Miami to check on her little brother.  One of the first people she meets is Sam Hooker, a NASCAR driver who is not amused because Bill seems to have stolen his boat.  The fast-moving dialogue between Alex and Bill is at the heart of the book, and keeps things light even in the face of the bad guys who suddenly seem very interested in Alex and her brother Bill.  Author Evanovich lives in Florida and does a good job of using Miami and the Florida Keys as a background for Alex's mayhem.  It's tough to forget Stephanie and bond with Alex, but it's too much fun to miss!	2005-01-15

In the latest installment, Quill's K Foundation is bankrolling a new bookstore which will be run by his lady love, Polly, the former librarian of Pickax.  All of the usual characters are in the book, along with Alden Wade, a smooth operator who has just moved to town.  He charms the locals and ends up marrying one of the wealthiest women in town under suspicious circumstances.  His stepson appears briefly in the book, but makes a hasty exit before he does much to impact the story.  Alden seems to be a lethal husband as two of his wives die, but there is no resolution in the book, just a lot of questions written in Quill's journal at the end.  Braun is at her best when she writes of the gentle interactions of Quill and his friends, but the well-constructed mysteries of her early books have been absent for some time.	2005-01-12

Since Bunny has a bad relationship with Simon, this puts Skye in an awkward position.

There are no end of suspects because Ken Addison was a much reviled person who cheated in his personal and professional lives.

A fourth important character is Olivia's friend Grace, whose husband Dan has a penchant for disappearing without warning.  Lastly, is Cecilia who married a young Navy man rather impusively and now regrets it.  Macomber moves her plot from one character to another, which keeps things interesting.

On one of her visits she is horrified to find that her grandmother has died.  She calls the local coronor, Simon, whom she is dating, much to the disgust of her family, who like to keep family business private.  Soon she finds herself investigating her kin and alienating many of them in the process.  If this isn't enough, she is in trouble with her school district's superintendant who wants her to falsify her school psychologist's records in order to please an influential parent.  A third complication is her love life which now includes two men who vie for her affection.  Having been a school employee with a job similar to Skye's, I recognize the problems she encounters with parents and administrators.  My only objection to Skye's behavior is that she seems to think nothing of being late for school or trying to take last-minute personal days when she has other things to do.  Most school employees are very conscientious about their attendance.  This book is the second in the series and shows good progress in plot and character development.  All in all, it's an enjoyable read.	2004-12-23

When she puts her investigative powers to work, Skye discovers that the victim had a lot of enemies.  In between her job as a school psychologist and her budding romance with a local man, Skye finally discovers the identity of the murderer when she is kidnapped and threatened by the perpetrator.  Denise Swanson's small-town Midwestern setting is enjoyable and her characters are interesting and well-drawn.  This debut novel encourages me to want to read the rest of the series.	2004-12-22

She convinces Judith that something strange is going on there and they need to investigate.  It seems like a dark, deserted place but a couple named Dick and Jane Bland live there.  They are rarely seen and their food is delivered to the door.  As they continue their investigation the cousins find that a mysterious package arrives at the house once a year.  Judith gets more than she bargains for when a dead body shows up in the trunk of her car as she and Renie are doing surveillance on the house.  The police feel that Judith is a likely suspect for the murder, so her investigative efforts are now carried on for her own protection.  As usual, Judith's friends and family provide a comic background, especially her cat Sweetums and her cantankerous mother who lives in a converted tool shed.  Judith is also concerned because of marital problems between her son Mike and his wife Kristen.  Daheim fans should enjoy this latest entry in the Bed-and-Breakfast Mystery series.	2004-12-21

It is, as another reviewer said, a book for intellectuals.  It is filled with poetry and difficult, convoluted sentences, yet the premise of the book is an interesting one.  Two researchers of Victorian poets, Roland and Maud, discover some letters which indicate a previously unknown affair between the two authors which they are researching.  Through painstaking investigation, they begin to slowly uncover the mysterious relationship, so long hidden, between the two authors.  Eventually the news of their discoveries leaks out and they are forced to protect their interests in the letters they have found.  This is a multi-layered book with romantic themes running throughout.  It is not a book I can say that I enjoyed reading, but it is interesting and complex.	2004-12-19

Shelley supplies the first project when her husband donates a theater to the local college for their dramas.  Shelley needs to try out some caterers for her husband's business dinners so she agrees to be in charge of arranging catered small suppers for the cast and crew of the first play which the college is producing.  Jane is persuaded to help her out and they are soon involved in meeting the egotistical writer/director of the play and his cast of interesting characters.  A second hobby which they take up is needle point and they enjoy sharing lessons with some of the other people in the play.  While all this is happening, Jane receives the exciting news that her first book is going to be published.  Of course no mystery would be complete without a dead body and soon one shows up at the theater.  Jane and Shelley \\"help\\" Jane's detective boyfriend solve the murder and everything is tied up neatly at the end.  Churchill's plots are always simple and it's not too difficult to discern the murderer, but her books make for a pleasant read.	2004-12-15

His main characters are Luther and Nora Krank, whose only child Blair is departing for Peru in order to help the poor and needy children there.  Devastated at her departure, they realize that Christmas will not be nearly as much fun without their daughter.  Luther is attracted to some travel literature and decides that it will make a lot more sense to spend their money on a cruise this year instead of blowing money on a season that they don't even enjoy any more.  Little do they realize that they will be under pressure from neighbors, friends, and even the local police and firemen to conform and celebrate with everyone else.  Soon comic complications set in, and the Kranks' plans seem to be for naught.  Grisham seems to have as deft a hand as a comic writer as he does when picturing courtroom drama.  This is a fun and light read for the holidays.	2004-12-11

Cheney's problem is that he is being blackmailed by someone who has possession of love letters which he wrote to a female student with whom he was having an affair.  Wilson and the girl broke up and she was subsequently killed in a fire.  Carlotta agrees to find out the identity of the blackmailer and try to get the love letters back from him, before Cheney is exposed.  In the course of her investigation, Carlotta encounters some interesting information concerning a drug company Wilson has started plus the fact that his marriage is very shaky.  Gradually the seemingly simple blackmail case turns into something much more, and Linda Barnes skillfully twists and turns the plot into a very interesting story.  I agree with some of the other reviewers who enjoy Carlotta's supporting cast and it was good to see a return of Sam and Paolina in this book.	2004-12-10

The thought of the brochure stays in the back of his mind until he decides to take action and begin planning the trip.  He invites his wife but she feels that family responsibilities for their five children are too heavy for both of them to be gone at the same time.  At this point Nicholas knows that there is only one person to invite--his brother Micah.  The two of them set off like a couple of school boys and they discover that the trip is a wonderful time for them to bond and heal, as well as to sightsee.  Each chapter covers a different location, and as they are having new adventures together, they reminisce about their growing-up years.  During the course of the book, it is revealed that the Sparks family has endured much more tragedy than most families, and it is interesting to see how Nicholas uses these tragedies for the basis of his novels.  The memoirs of his family were much more interesting to me than the travelogue, but the combination of the two make for a very intriguing book.	2004-12-07

Petra's case is made more difficult by the lack of identification of one of the victims and by eye-witnesses who are reluctant to get involved.  Meanwhile Isaac thinks he has discovered some links between unsolved murders, all of which might be committed by one serial killer.  Although doubting him at first, Petra begins seeing the pieces fall in place which support Isaac's theory.  Add to this Isaac's dewy-eyed adoration of Petra, a middle-aged librarian in hot romantic pursuit of Isaac, and Petra's wandering journalist boyfriend Eric, and it makes for interesting reading.  Petra gets in trouble with her superiors but, ever resourceful, she always manages to do her job.  Despite some unnecessary plot swings, this is another good read from Jonathan Kellerman.	2004-12-06

The residents take him to their heart and, as one of the few bachelors in town, he is soon in great social demand.  The plot thickens when the local shop owner rescues a baby cardinal and people begin coming to his store just to see the red bird.  Soon a little girl named Patsy comes to the store and Jack the bird becomes her best friend.  Patsy is crippled and is living with a family that does not take care of her or even want her.

Suddenly there is an embarrassment of riches and she has two clients.  The first one is Eddie Conklin, an ex-cop who is now working for a national security firm.  He asks Carlotta to investigate some shady doings at the \\"Big Dig\\", Boston's over-budget tunnel project which is supposed to alleviate traffic problems in the city.  The second client is a wealthy woman named Dana who wants Carlotta to find her missing tenant.  Both of these cases are just the tip of the iceburg of bigger, more serious problems which Carlotta uncovers.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book suffers a bit because Carlotta's usual supporting cast members are either missing (Mooney) or given small parts (Roz).  Paolina is becoming more obnoxious with each passing book, which is a shame since her relationship with her Big Sister was once a very appealing part of the series.  Also, in this book Carlotta is so busy running around solving mysteries that she doesn't have time to hang out with her volleyball-playing buddies.  Fans of Barnes will want to read this book, but it's not the best in the series.	2004-12-02

She receives a visit from Mrs. Burton-Cox, a woman whose son wishes to marry Celia.  She has a strange request--that Mrs. Oliver find out whether Celia's mother killed her father or vice versa.  She does not reveal her reasons for wanting this information, but her request sends Mrs. Oliver right to Poirot who does much of the sleuthing for her.  The two friends take separate paths in order to interview as many people as possible who can remember things from the Ravenscrofts' past.  Mrs. Oliver dubs the witnesses as \\"elephants\\", people who will not forget important details which may help them solve the case.  The mystery in this particular novel is not as difficult for the reader to unravel as it is in most of Christie's books, and that spoiled the fun for me a bit.  Uncharacteristically the author reveals too many clues too early in the book, but it still is worth reading.	2004-11-30

Things become more complicated as their son goes to college, their daughter becomes an uncommunicative teenager, and her mother moves in with them.  A crisis occurs when Sam loses his job and Ruth's father, who has been estranged from her mother for many years, injures himself and asks to come live with Ruth and Sam.  Ruth's parents can hardly stand to be in the same room together, which makes meals and other family occasions a little difficult.  When things get really bad, Ruth pretends that she is inside a cake which seems to calm her down.  Baking a cake is even better, although her family begs her to quit feeding them her baked goods when they feel overstuffed.  Sam does not seem to be making any progress towards getting a job and becomes enamored with the idea of buying a boat and fixing it up.  Ruth's mother, ever the practical one, thinks that Sam is just being idle, while her father, the dreamer, encourages Sam to follow his dream.  This book is all about following your passions, in middle age and beyond, and turning them into something special.  Although her first two books were better than this one, Jeanne Ray again writes a delightful novel with wonderful dialogue and characters.  I was disappointed to read in an interview that Ray says that this is her last book and I sincerely hope she reconsiders and continues writing.	2004-11-27

Just as they congratulate themselves on having a quiet night with a dinner for two, the McSwains are interrupted by two phone calls.  One of them is from their emotional daughter Kay, who has just become engaged to one of the wealthiest men in town, and the other is from Caroline's sister Taffy whose husband is leaving her for another woman.  Thus starts the delightful chaos which envelopes the McSwains and their friends.  One especially enjoyable character is Woodrow, a contractor who is making the McSwain's home improvement project into his life's work.  In his spare time, he trains Taffy's wayward dog and begins to restore her self-esteem.  By the time things are worked out and the proper people have become couples, the reader has had some good laughs and has grown very fond of Ray's loveable characters.

Although possessed by moods of depression, Moody is a loving husband and father most of the time.  When his nephew comes to visit, they begin to plan for Moody's family to come to Iran for a two-week vacation.  Betty suspects that Moody may try to detain them in his native land, but she relents when he promises on the Koran that this will not be the case.  They go to Iran, where Betty finds Moody's relatives to be rude and arrogant, as well as having filthy houses and bodies.  She cannot wait for the 2 weeks to be over, but when the time comes to return to the States, Betty's worst nightmare comes true when Moody detains them.  While he is in Iran, Moody's word is law and no one can interfere with his decision to keep his family there.  What follows is a nightmare of beatings, harrassment, and virtual imprisonment, as Moody returns to his traditional Islamic ways.

She has been taught from an early age that Cacciamanis mean trouble, and when her daughter Sandy had the temerity to fall in love with one, she and her then-husband dutifully broke up the teenage romance.   <br />Julie's business is floundering and she again meets Romeo Cacciamani (father of Sandy's ex-lover) at a seminar for small business owners.

Unfortunately these two novellas do not give them a proper forum in which do do what they do best.  The Boston story is the better of the two and deals with the death of a talented college basketball player.  From among the characters in this story, the detective named Dorothy, who is the single mother of a large brood of growing kids, is interesting and worth developing.  The Santa Fe story deals with the death of an obnoxious art dealer and neither the character nor the plot inspire much interest.

The plot centers around a group of people who have come to a Greek island for various reasons, mostly to avoid a bad situation at home.  While they are there, a tragic fire occurs on a tourist boat, and the separate people are drawn together by their common witness of the unhappy scene.  One character is fleeing from a divorce, another one has left a cheating boyfriend, yet another one is avoiding taking over his father's business and the last one is running away with her boyfriend in spite of the disapproval of her parents.  An older woman named Vonni becomes a counselor to them all, although she is not wise about her own life and situation.  A recurring theme is broken relationships within the family and the possiblity of healing those relationships.  Despite the author's best efforts, I never felt really involved in these characters' lives or their problems.  The relationships between them formed too quickly and too superficially to have the life-changing impact that they were supposed to have.

Anyone who thinks that Yao has had it easy, will soon discover that he has worked very hard for everything he has and that his 7'6\\" frame has sometimes been as much a liability as it has been an asset.  Yao describes a bit about his growing-up years and shows how his parents, although basketball players themselves, wanted something more for their son.  They encouraged him to pursue a college degree, but when he opted for life as a professional athlete, they supported him in his decision.  Although very committed to China and to playing for its national team, Yao shows a surprisingly independent spirit and has definite opinions which he shares in the book.  Things bog down a bit during the chapters on the negotiations which brought him to the Houston Rockets and the NBA, and the multiple voices which tell the story are rather distracting and confusing at times.  Yao is at his best when he uses his humor to contrast life styles between China and the U.S.  Although he sometimes pokes fun at both cultures, he manages to show respect to the individuals he writes about.  With his work ethic, competitiveness, and balanced outlook on life, Yao is sure to be a success in anything he attempts in life. <br />	2004-10-24

She begins to investigate Thea's wealthy and politically-active family and begins to uncover some skeletons in the closet.  She works with her old police buddy, Mooney, and after several red herrings, begins to unravel a tangled web of lies and deceit that run very deep in Thea's family.  Some of the familiar elements of this series are missing in this book.  Carlotta plays nary a game of volleyball and her little sister Paolina is absent until the very end of the book.  A parting of the ways occurs between Carlotta and her current lover with suddenness and fury over a seemingly minor matter.  Also, the presence of Paolina's father lurks furtively in the shadows, but never really makes an impact on the story.  Other than this, readers should enjoy this entry in the series.	2004-10-22

The 5 women are Faith, a woman with a secret past; Merit, the dutiful pastor's daughter; Kari, a strong and loving woman; Slip, a political activist; and Audrey whose favorite topic is sex.  Those who have strong marriages provide support for those who do not and later they all swap child-rearing stories and advice.  They survive abuse, death, alcoholism, illness, and divorce.  Each decade of their lives is chronicled, along with the world events that influence many people during that time.  This is a formula which has been used by many authors, but Landvik's version has well-defined characters whom readers can really care about.	2004-10-05

In this book she evokes the melancholy mood and slower pace of the Mississippi Delta and uses it to create a book about five generations of China's relatives and the tangled web of deceit which some of them wove.  Without her usual supporting cast of husband, son, best friend, and other inhabitants of Pecan Springs, China goes to the Mississippi plantation of her ancestors to help her mother Leatha to care for her sickly Aunt Tullie.  There has been a death, and Leatha is afraid that the old woman is somehow involved.  When China investigates the murder, she finds more than she bargains for and begins uncovering long-hidden secrets of her family.  Before she is through she discovers forbidden love affairs, illegitimate children, suicide, murder, and many betrayals by family members.  This is a nice change of pace for this series and it shows that Albert can write about a variety of settings with continued high quality in her writing.	2004-09-28

Curtis recreated battle scenes by hiring <br />Indians to dress like their forefathers and relive scenes from the past.  During one of these photo sessions an Arapaho woman is shot and killed.  Her Anglo husband testifies that he saw three Indians murder his wife.  With this as a background, the book shifts to the present-day Wind River Reservation, where an Arapaho woman is found dead.  Father John O'Malley and Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden discover a connection between the Curtis photographs and the recent murder.  Their investigation threatens a politician who is running for Senator and who advocates mining the natural resources on the reservation.  As usual, Vicky and Father John grapple with their feelings for one another as they attempt to solve the murder and to do what is right.  This is an altogether satisfying mystery which gives the reader a look at history and a feel for the Arapaho culture.	2004-09-27

As if this isn't enough, she's run out of wreaths and has to make a trip to the country to pick up new ones from the two sisters who make them for her.  While she is visiting with them she discovers that they are having problems with their neighbor Carl who supplies China with mistletoe for her herb shop.  She also discovers that they are caring for their elderly aunt, who thinks that she is being pursued by Klingons.  When Carl is killed by a hit-and-run driver China suspects one of the neighbor woman hit him on purpose.  Further complications occur when China's best friend Ruby, begins acting strangely and refuses to talk to China about what's bothering her.  Her last problem is her new cook at the tea room, who seems to have a problem with larceny.  Albert does her usual fine job of weaving a mystery around the professional and personal life of China Bayles.  Although the killer seems to confess too easily to China in the end, this is still a good addition to the series.	2004-09-24

Charlotte Muravieff asks Kate to prove that her mother is in jail on false charges that she killed her son in a fire 30 years ago.  Kate somewhat reluctantly takes the case and begins her investigation into the crime.  In doing so, she tangles with one of the most influential families in Alaska.  Soon, people close to the case begin to die and Kate knows that she is getting close to an answer.  Her own life is also put in danger.  Two subplots which are woven through the main plot involve her relationship with policeman Jim Chopin (written in a surprisingly heavy-handed fashion) and two young boys who seek refuge with Kate when things get too tough at home.

Adriana Trigiani has a way of drawing readers into her stories of Italian-Americans and making them feel like one of the family.  This book starts out slowly but gains momentum as the reader follows the life and dreams of Nella Caselluca.  Nella puts up with the bullying of her older sister and life on a farm which she does not enjoy in order to achieve her dream of becoming a teacher.  Her family supports her in this, until a near-tragedy derails her plans.  She goes to work in a blouse factory in order to help her family through a difficult time.  In the midst of this turmoil she meets the handsome Renato whose relationship with Nella is woven throughout the book.  Nella is stubborn and independent and it takes her a long time to realize what real love is all about.  Some of the plot lines seem somewhat contrived, but Trigiani's ability to touch the reader's emotions and create endearing characters is undiminished in this book.	2004-09-17

Her old friend, police lieutenant Mooney helps her with the former and her sometime lover Sam's friend Frank helps her with the latter.  Added to this is Carlotta's angst at receiving large sums of money for her Little Sister Paolina from Paolina's mobster father which she doesn't know what to do with before Paolina goes to college.  Her tenant and sidekick Roz is tired of having the money stuffed into her mattress.  The plot thickens when there is an attack on Green & White, the cab company owned by Sam whose family is also connected with the Mob.  All of these elements are woven into a very complex plot which is a little hard to follow at times.

If this isn't bad enough, Carlotta's garbage cans are stolen from her yard, and her little sister Paolina (from the Big Sister' Organization) is <br />consorting with a much older man.

McQuaid becomes embroiled in a murder case and China decides that she'd better help him solve it if he is to be at the wedding on time.  The victim is Edgar Coleman, a local real estate developer who will stoop to any means to complete a deal.  He needed approval from the city council for a new real estate deal to go through, so he methodically gathered incriminating information on each council member and threatened to reveal their secrets if they didn't give him a favorable vote.  His other character flaw was a penchant for chasing women other than his wife.  These two factors provide a slew of suspects for the murder.  Author Albert skillfully weaves a lot of red herrings into the book, along with the frantic preparations for a wedding which is threatened by all sorts of catastrophes.  Only China could go through a 2-week pre-wedding period such as the one in this book.  This is Albert at her best!	2004-09-09

The reason for this is Mike's ongoing rehabilitation as the result of a shooting which occurred during one of his recent investigations.  Added to this, China's mother has come to help out and their relationship has always been tenuous at best.  China is temporarily distracted from her problems when the whole town begins preparing for its annual chili cook-off.  McQuaid is also pulled from his depresssion when the cook-off sponsors persuade him to return to his annual role as a judge in the contest.  All seems to be going well when one of the other judges dies after tasting several of the chili recipes which have been submitted.  China and McQuaid begin to help the police by tracking down who could have tampered with the chili and who had a motive for killing the judge.  The judge was considered quite a ladies' man and was in the middle of a nasty divorce, so suspects abound.  Albert takes the reader on a round of plausible red herrings before the killer is finally revealed.  This book develops the characters of China, McQuaid, and China's friend Ruby to a new level and really shows Albert's skill as a writer.  The many interesting facts about chili peppers sprinkled throughout the book also add to the readers' enjoyment.	2004-09-04

It has perched at or near the top of the Best Seller List for many weeks.  In his book, under the guise of fiction, Dan Brown makes some phenomenal assertions.  He refutes the basis of the Christian religion, namely that Jesus is the son of God and He is the only way to salvation.  In this book, two Christian theologians dispute this viewpoint and defend the Christian faith.  They assert that the sources which Dan Brown uses to make his claim are faulty and have been proven to be so.  Some of their arguments are a little \\"soft\\", such as the fact that the Bible contains the stories of Deborah, Tamar, Rahab, and Mary, and therefore Christianity is not anti-female.  A more compelling argument is the treatment of women by Jesus himself, who showed love and concern for all people, regardless of gender or status.  Many people say that this debate is not important, that \\"The DaVinci Code\\" is merely cleverly-written fiction.  Dan Brown has give numerous interviews that show that he clearly had an agenda for writing the book.  Garlow and Jones point out his agenda and demonstrate the danger which \\"The DaVinci Code\\" gives in presenting paganism and gnosticism as a viable alternative to Christianity.  They make a point that people have two choices in their religious beliefs:  they can either worship the Creator or that which He Created.  The authors also show that in our \\"feel-good\\" society, the allure of these ancient relgious practices is very enticing.  Dan Brown uses his characters in a convincing way to demonstrate what he sees as the validity of his beliefs.  Garlow and Jones are less successful with their fictional character, Carrie.  Nonetheless, their message is an important one and will hopefully serve as a warning to those who embrace the tempting and charmismatic beliefs of Dan Brown.	2004-09-02

Because of this China eagerly agrees to accompany her ex-nun friend Maggie on a retreat to the monastary where Maggie used to be.  She anticipates two weeks of quiet, solitude, and the opportunity to meditate on the course she wants her life to take.  When she arrives, she finds things to be very different than she had pictured.  The monastary had been heavily endowed by the wealthy woman who donated the land and she intended for it to be used to house the nuns and to grow a special kind of garlic.  Recently the old convent had been merged with another group of nuns and the new group wants to build a large meeting center with all the amenities.  The sisters are deadlocked over this issue and it is causing strife between the two factions.  Soon, disturbing letters are being sent to the nuns and some fires wreak havoc in the convent.  Also some items begin to disappear and two elderly nuns die mysteriously.  If this isn't enough, China encounters an old boyfriend from the days when she was an attorney in Houston.  She is sorely tempted to resume her relationship with him, despite her attachment to McQuaid.  All of these things cause a tangled web of intrigue which China unravels, after a few false starts.

Unfit and woefully unprepared, the two men set out on a 2,000 mile adventure.  Creature comforts become real luxuries as they slog along the trail fighting heat, cold, insects, muscle camps, and blisters.  There are a few instances of real or imagined danger, but mostly they are two city boys who find out what the woods are really all about.  The book bogs down a bit as Bryson lectures about the geology, flora and fauna of the areas he's traversing, and his carping on environmental issues becomes downright tedious at times.  This book is definitely at its best when Bryson gives his wry view of his personal hiking experience, especially when in the company of the intrepid Katz who is his perfect comic foil.	2004-08-13

Her detective agency is not doing well financially, and her fiance, Mr. Matekoni, has two lazy apprentices who are not helping him much with his car repair business.  Added to this, Mr. Matekoni himself is behaving in a very strange manner.  Rather than fire her secretary, Precious instead promotes her and puts her in charge of running both the car repair business and the detective agency.  For some reason, which is not well explained in the book, Mma Makutsi is wildly successful in running the businesses and motivating the apprentices.  Mr. Matekoni is shuffled off to the local orphanage (which makes no sense) to try to recover from his problem.  His absence is keenly felt in the book and part of the interest is lost because he and Precious have very little interaction in this installment.  Also there are some subplots which are weak or which go nowhere (such as Mma Makutsi's ill brother and the strange boy who is found in the wilderness.)  The book is at its best when Mma Ramotswe is trying to solve the mystery of a Government Man's relative who is being poisoned, and Mma Makutsi investigates the moral character of four beauty pageant contestants.  These plot lines show the delightful tongue-in-cheek spirit which have made these books so popular.	2004-08-09

The story takes place in Scotland and revolves around the people who are attending the Lochdubh School of Casting: Salmon and Trout Fishing.  The school is run by John and Heather Cartwright who are working hard to make the school a profitable endeavor.  The guests include an American couple, an attorney, a secretary, a 12-year-old boy, and ex-army major, and a debutante.  These people would have probably gotten along if it had not been for Lady Jane Winters.  Lady Jane knows a guilty secret about each of the guests and she is not hesitant to proclaim the secret to everyone.  The guests all loathe her, so it is not surprising when she shows up dead, on the end of someone's fishing pole.  Hamish Macbeth, the village constable, comes on the scene, but he is not nearly as interesting as Agatha Christie's inimitable Hercule Poirot.  Also the solution to the identity of the murderer is pretty straighforward and doesn't have the clever twist that many mystery writers add.	2004-06-09

I only saw the incandescant smile and the undeniable charm of this young actress.  James Spada has done his homework and he uses multiple sources to put together the story of this complex, often insecure woman.  In the early part of the book, the reader learns that Julia's parents created and directed a children's theater in Atlanta, Georgia.  They were some of the first people to cross the color line, and their clients included the four children of Martin Luther King.  Julia's father was charismatic, but troubled, and ran the gamut from charming to abusive.  Her mother had her own problems and was unfaithful to her husband.  Julia and her estranged brother seem to hold divergent opinions about their parents, but clearly this was a dysfunctional family.  Spada chronicles Julia's school days, during which she considered herself an ugly duckling.  He follows her during the lean early years of her acting career and traces her meteoric rise from a walk-on part in &quot;Firehouse&quot; in the mid-80's to her first big break in &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; in 1989.  During this time Julia began the pattern of pursuing men, falling in love with them, and then leaving them which repeated itself countless times in her life.  The book continues through the 2003 release of the &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; and the projected 2004 sequel to &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot;.  Although there is no evidence that Spada spoke directly to Roberts, he manages to assemble a lot of information which he shares with the reader.  This book shows all sides of Roberts, some which support her charming on-screen persona and some which are a lot less charming.  Kudos to him for a job well done.	2004-06-03

Immediately things start to go wrong and Shawna and Johnny fear that they will lose the ranch when an old set of human bones is found during a trail ride.  They fear that this grisly discovery will upset their guests and that none of them will want to come back.  Also mysterious things begin to happen, such as a fire and the escape of a prize bull.  There are a number of interesting minor characters, including Victory, a well-known quilter who gives lectures, and an interesting foursome of female cousins who enjoy the company of Hud, the investigator sent to uncover the mystery of the bones.  Earlene Fowler seems to like romantic triangles and she perhaps overdoes this in creating tension between Gabe, Hud, and Benni, as well as Shawna, Johnny, and Whip, a cowboy whom Shawna's father had taken under his wing.  Also there are a few loose ends, such as why the fire was started and whether the bull's escape was an accident or not.  Other than that, this is a good read and an enjoyable entry in the series.	2004-05-30

Charlie and her husband Drake have agreed to run Drake's friend Brian's helicopter service to the oil rigs while Brian is with his dying mother.  They look on it as a lark and an adventure in a new part of the world, but they don't bank on some of the hardships that they will encounter.  They are staying in a cottage on the grounds of a castle and they become acquainted with Robert and Sarah Dunbar, the castle's inhabitants.  When the Dunbars discover that Charlie is a professional investigator, they ask her to try to recover two of their lambs which are missing.  Later, they come to her with a more serious problem when their grandson is kidnapped.  The third problem they face is serious opposition to the helicopter business from union workers who fear that the helicopter service will put the union's boat service out of business.  There are lots of suspenseful passages in the book and Charlie and Drake are an attractive, loving couple.  The main flaw is that the three mysteries are given a big buildup and the solutions to them are somewhat anticlimatic.  Other than that, this is a good read.	2004-05-25

One thing he did know was that she was different.  Different from his father, his siblings, himself, his friends, and his neighbors.  When he would ask her if she was white, she would avoid the question or answer that she was &quot;light-skinned&quot;.  When he once asked her what color God was she replied, &quot;He's the color of water.  He has no color&quot;.  This is the way Ruth McBride looked at the world.  When her Jewish family acted in an unloving manner towards her, she turned to black friends, who were more accepting of her.  James loved his white mother, whom he calls &quot;Mommy&quot; in the book but was also embarrassed by her racial differences and was confused by a lack of knowledge of her roots.  This book seemed to be a catharsis for him as it allowed him to contact some of his mother's relatives and old friends whom he had never met.  Ruth McBride considered her greatest achievement to be the many college degrees which her 12 children earned and their professional occupations.  This is an interesting story of a woman who did not ever let life defeat her and who held high educational and behavioral standards for her racially-mixed children.  It is also the story of a search for identity.	2004-05-22

Because of this, he feels that he can't turn down the offer of a chance to fill in for a divinity professor at Harvard for a semester.  Surprisingly, big-city girl Faith feels sad to pull up her roots from Aleford, if only for a little while.  When she reaches their house in Cambridge, she feels a sense of foreboding, as if something mysterious has happened there at one time.  Her feelings prove to be true when she finds a diary written by a woman who was literally held as a prisoner by her husband in the house in the 1940's.  Meanwhile Faith encounters an old boyfriend named Richard at a homeless shelter and he tells her that he is doing undercover research for a new book he is writing.  She begins to meet with Richard and does not tell her husband Tom about the meetings.  This particular plot twist did not sit well with this reader, particularly since Faith is very vocal about her jealousy over one of Tom's female graduate students who becomes friendlier to him than Faith would like.  Eventually the questions brought up by the diary and by Richard's presence are answered, and this latest &quot;Body&quot; book ends with some of Faith's favorite recipes.  This is another good entry in the series about the caterer and the pastor.	2004-05-17

A young woman named Rosaleen has married a man named Underway.  Upon Underway's death, Rosaleen remarries a wealthy man named Gordon Cloade.  He dies two weeks after the marriage, which makes Rosaleen a very wealthy widow indeed.  She and her brother come to take over Cloade's home and fortune, much to the dismay of Cloade's family who have lost a fortune to her.  Soon a man comes to town and claims that Rosaleen's first husband, Underway, is not dead, meaning Rosaleen is still married to him and so should not inherit Cloade's fortune.  People begin to die and one of the Cloade men asks for Hercule Poirot's help in solving the mystery.  Poirot interviews the people involved, gets his little gray cells working and puts together the puzzle to solve the murders.  This is another wonderful book by the world's most famous mystery author.	2004-05-11

Among the authors' goals seems to be to translate the words of Revelation into a story that modern people can understand and to encourage people to search in their Bibles for the truth.  In these two things the authors have been hugely successful, as evidenced by the sales of their books.  As for this particular book, it is not one of their best.  The authors try to include as much Bibical knowledge as they can, and as a result they lose the human element.  Some of the events seem too simplistic and the characters do a lot of joking around about the single most important event in history.  The book seems shallow and anti-climactic after the buildup of the previous 11 books.  I hope that this series will encourage the writing of better fiction, based on the Bible, in the future.	2004-05-10

During the course of the book, Pi tells the story in great detail of how his zookeeper father attempted to move his family from India to Canada.  Pi, along with his parents and brother, was aboard a ship that sank.  He ended up on a life boat with a small group of animals, which his father was transporting to various zoos.  By his wits and by the grace of God, whom he worships as a Christian, Muslim and a Hindu, Pi does survive an experience which would have killed a person with less hope or fewer survival skills.  At the end, Pi is questioned by two Japanese men who represent the company who owned the ship that sank.  They do not believe his story and so Pi tells the story again, in a condensed form which changes many of the important details.  The reader is left with the dilemma as to which story is true.

Unfortunately I was disappointed by what I found.  The book has the obligatory complex family tree at the beginning and a beleagured heroine in Amy Steadman, the main heiress of her grandmother's fortune.  After her grandmother's untimely death, supposedly at the hands of a mysterious intruder, Amy goes to her North Carolina home to clean up her things and sign the papers to sell the house.  She becomes reacquainted with family members whom she hasn't seen in years, and discovers that all of them stand to benefit financially from her grandmother's death.  She also looks into her mother's suicide which occurred when she was a small child.  On top of this, Amy suspects that her husband Eric is having an affair, but actually has nothing to prove it.  She flirts with a law officer in North Carolina and keeps putting off her husband's calls, a jarring note to her supposedly decent character.  Her half-sister Beth appears on the scene and her character zigs and zags its way thorugh the book in a way that lacks credence.  After reading this book, I look forward to the next Deborah Knott story with great anticipation.	2004-05-09

He is caught by the police chief, but his slick lawyer, who had betrayed Ellen romantically, works hard to prove him innocent.

Most of the people there are related in one way or another to the host couple, the Angkatells.  One of the guests, Dr. Christow, is married to Gerda but is carrying on an affair with another guest named Henrietta.  The Angkatells' neighbor turns out to be a woman who was engaged to marry Dr. Christow, but who broke up with him before the wedding was performed.  Dr. Christow is interested in women, but his main focus seems to be on his work, in which he is researching a rare disease.  Not surprisingly, Christow is the victim of murder, and his wife Gerda is found standing over him with a gun.  Hercule Poirot is a guest at the home and comes upon the scene shortly after the murder.  Upon further investigation, it is discovered that the gun in Gerda's hand was not used in the murder.  Which of the remaining guests had a motive?  The police investigator goes chasing after red herrings while Poirot uses his little grey cells and succeeds in finding the murderer.

Bush was an unlikely candidate for the U.S. presidency in his early days.  Overshadowed by his high-achieving father and without a coherant plan for his life, he floundered until his Christian conversion led to lofty goals and plans.  This book details the gradual awakening of Bush's spiritual side, with influence from his wife Laura, Billy Graham and other Christian leaders.  From a carefree playboy, he became a devout, religious man who was not afraid to express his beliefs in a sometimes unfriendly political arena.  Since becoming President, he has seen issues through the filter of his Christianity and he has responded accordingly.  This book is profoundly comforting in its portrayal of our highest leader as a man of God.  It gives me great hope for the future of our country.	2004-04-02

The author is a man, and yet he writes this book in the first person and succeeds in sounding like the voice of a Japanese woman.  She is born with the name Chiyo in a small fishing village on the Sea of Japan.  Unfortunate family circumstances cause her father to sell her and her sister to someone who will have them trained to become geishas.  She and her sister are separated and she is put into a household of women, including another geisha who always seems to be at cross-purposes with Chiyo.  When she tries to meet her sister and run away, she is caught and her training is interrupted.  When things seem darkest for her, there is always a rescuer who appears on the scene.  One of the most fascinating parts of the book is the training Chiyo goes through.  Geishas consider themselves to be hostesses and entertainers and they spend years training in dance, singing, musical instruments, and the tea ceremony.  Throughout her life Sayuri, as she is known after becoming a geisha, is at the mercy of other people, first the women in the place where she lives, and later the men who support her.  This is a bittersweet tale of a young girl who first loses her family and then her closest friends in order to survive and attain her goals.  It is a fascinating look at one aspect of another culture, but it has sad undercurrents throughout.	2004-04-01

When her relatives come to visit, they all try to talk Aunt Emily into giving them some money.  She refuses all of them, and that evening, she takes a nasty fall down the steps, presumably as a result of tripping over Bob's ball which is often left at the top of the landing.  She is injured, but not fatally, but some days later she does succumb to some mysterious malady.  She writes a letter to Hercule Poirot after her fall and it is delivered to him posthumously.

In this book Brigid is a woman who has always resented her mother for deserting her as a child, but who always adored the father who raised her.  Upon his death, she inherited his estate and converted it into guest cottages which she and her husband rent out.  Despite her resentment towards her mother, Frummie, she allows her to live in one of the cottages.  She also resents her half-sister Jemima who lives nearby and who seems utterly irresponsible to Brigid.  Brigid's husband Humphrey is in the navy and is gone most of the time, but they still manage to have a loving marriage.  Humphrey has a difficult relationship with his father Alexander, who remarried very soon after Humphrey's beloved mother died.  Alexander comes to stay for a few weeks and he proves to be the catalyst to healing relationships between Brigid, Frummie, and Jemima.  Another important character is Louise, a boarder, who has become good friends with Brigid.  She is trying to heal from a painful family experience and finds the quiet English countryside a good place to do so.  Willett's strength lies in the development of deep characters and their interaction with one another.  The book moves somewhat slowly at the beginning, but the pace picks up a bit as the reader comes to know the characters better.  This is a very good read for those who like books about relationships.	2004-03-16

As for the positives, Anita Diamant is a beautiful writer whose prose almost sounds like poetry at times.  Her descriptions of the events and emotions of the women who surrounded Jacob in the Bible are deep and believable.  She is a good story-teller and the life of Dinah, Jacob's only daughter is told in an interesting and compelling fashion.  As has been noted in many of the other reviews, Diamant does some creative editing to the original story from Genesis.  Some may argue that this is a work of fiction and, as such, the author has free reign.  However, when you are using the Bible as a source it should be given the respect and accuracy that it deserves.  For instance, the author changes the time of 7 years which Jacob worked for each of his first 2 wives to 7 months.  This completely denigrates the point that Jacob was a dedicated and determined man who did what it took to meet his goals.  Another fabrication is the fact that Rachel asked her sister Leah to step in for her at her wedding ceremony at the last minute.  In fact, it was her father Laban who did this and thus showed a weakness in character and an unwillingness to do as he promised, which was to give Rachel to Jacob as his wife.  The rape of Dinah is described as a love affair between her and the prince, a point which changed the whole rest of the story.  Also the mention of a variety of gods disregards the fact that Jacob, as Isaac and Abraham before him, was loyal to one God.  Author Diamant seems unable to accept the fact that women were second-class citizens in those days and she changes the story to accommodate greater power than they really possessed.  Hoping that at least most of the background was true, I turned to the author's website and was disappointed to discover that probably the red tent itself did not exist during Dinah's lifetime.  Mixing fact and fiction with such a heavy hand is confusing to a reader who hopes to find some truth even in a fictionalized telling of a Bible story.  The book starts out on a high note, but begins to fail as the plot twists are fabricated, and the last section, which takes place in Egypt is downright dreary.  It's difficult to write a better story than God did.	2004-03-12

He uses a combination of setting (Mississippi in the newly-desegregating 70's) unforgettable characters, and a plot which has enough twists to keep the reader interested and guessing.  In this book a young man named Willie Traynor has talked his wealthy grandmother into buying him a small-town newspaper with a shrinking circulation.  He manages to expand the paper's readership by including human interest stories and just enough controversy to keep the Letters to the Editor column full.  When there is a brutal rape and murder, everyone knows that is is Danny Padgitt of the notorious Padgitt Family who did it.  The dying woman had his name on her lips and Danny had her blood on his clothes.  The Padgitts are extremely powerful people in the community and Willie and his friends doubt that he will be convicted.  After the trial Danny threatens all of the jurors, and Mississippi laws (which Grisham admits to exaggerating) allow him to be released from prison much sooner than the town of Clanton expects.  Grisham delves into race relations, crooked politics, bad laws, and our all-too-human tendency to judge people without knowing all of the facts.  This book has a bit over everything and should be a winner with old and new Grisham fans.	2004-03-05

He knows that the killer had to be someone in the room so he begins his investiation of the the four family members and two others who might be involved.  The usual red herrings are thrown out before Poirot reveals the real culprit.  This is an average Christie story and doesn't contain any of the clever twists that distinguish her best work.	2004-02-11

Each one faces a crisis for which she is unprepared, during the course of the book.  Eve is the central character, and her world is rocked when her \\"perfect marriage\\" comes to an end as the result of the death of her husband.  At first she retreats into herself, but eventually she forges a new life for herself and her children.  Annie is an independent, self-starter who is used to achieving anything she sets out to do.  However, her obsessive desire to have a child, although she is 43-years-old, drives her husband to despair.  Although she is used to being in control, she discovers that her body is one thing she cannot control.  Doris is a wealthy woman who is used to being the perfect wife, mother, and hostess, at least to the outside world.  She finally realizes that much of her life is a lie and she has to come to terms with who she really is and what she wants out of life.  Midge is a single woman who longs for love and belonging, but doesn't seem to know how to go about it.  She has an uneasy relationship with her mother, and she is not pleased when her mother moves from Florida to the Chicago area to be closer to her.  Gabriella is not as fully developed as the other characters, but she faces the problem of having a husband who is out of work which forces her to get a job and keep expanding her hours.  Each woman's story is interesting and the interactions between the characters are delightful.  My main criticism would be that too many of the women's problems are solved too easily and the bad attitudes and wrong thinking that they display seems to \\"magically\\" disappear in order to give the book a happy and tidy ending.	2004-02-10

They share a love of snorkeling and scuba diving, they tease each other as only close spouses can do, and they plan for a future life in the Cayman Islands.  On September 11, 2001, the unthinkable happens when Jim is killed in his office on the 105th. floor of the World Trade Center.  Jennifer is shocked beyond belief and wallows in pain and denial until the anger breaks through.  She rails at God and repeatedly asks him why this had to happen.  She has always been a faithful Catholic and has prayed to God daily for her husband's safety.  That is the way her life has always been--she prays and God provides.  What has happened to the &quot;contract&quot; she has with God?  She relates the numbingly painful days which follow Jim's death--the empty holidays and the searing grief.  Gradually she begins to see that God is sending her &quot;angels&quot;, people of faith who help her faith grow.  She is able to establish some special memorials to her husband and she begins to look outward to others and upward to God to find peace.  The most revealing part of the book is the diary at the end in which she writes her innermost, unvarnished thoughts and feelings to God.  It shows the metamorphosis of a woman who is focused on her own pain to one who accepts and embraces the love and comfort of God.  Jennifer is truly polished and refined by the fire of this tragedy and she emerges as an example of Christian faith and forebearance in the face of unspeakable tragedy.	2004-02-09

She creates a wonderful setting of small-town ambience with the creation of a new bookstore in Pickax and the 200th. birthday celebration of the neighboring town of Brr.  Oh, and by the way, there is a murder which Qwill solves in his spare time, with the murderer confessing to his crime during a casual conversation.  Author Braun creates warm and wonderful characters, including the two felines Koko and YumYum, and that is indeed where her strength lies.  The murders in these books seem almost an intrusion on the gentle life of Pickax and are probably unnecessary.  Perhaps the cats could work on less lethal mysteries and the results would be better.  Also, it seems that the introduction of a group of turkeys in this book is done in order to give the book a name.<BR>Readers are advised to seek out the earlier books in the series, which are much better-written.	2004-02-05

In this book the heroine, Prue Valour, is a 41-year-old woman who is married to Max, a man 20 years older than she is.  At the beginning of their marriage, Max's daughter Violet gave Prue a lot of problems, so she is not pleased to hear that Violet, her husband Jamie, and baby Edward are coming for a protracted stay.  Violet has not lost any of her waspish nature, and her husband Jamie begins to realize it as much as Prue.  From this bit of shared experience comes a growing fondness between Jamie and Prue.  Their feelings escalate and soon they are engaged in an affair.  Another major character is Emmy, Edward's nanny, who is treated badly by Violet and who is pursued by an irresponsible man who eventually makes her pregnant.  Buchan sifts these difficult elements with a deft hand and comes to some interesting conclusions.  The weaknesses in the book are its slow pace and the attempt to compare Prue's situation with Joan of Arc whom she is researching for a book.	2004-02-04

She invites a diverse group which includes her lawyer, her accountant, a reporter, her daughter, and a collector of movie souvenirs.  The auction seems strange because Tasheba and her husband Cavender have been recluses on a remote island off the coast of Maine for many years.  Among the guests are writer Bennis Hannaford and her friend Gregor Demarkian, an ex-F.B.I. agent.  The presence of Demarkian seems to make some of the guests nervous, and some of them appear to have secrets to hide.  There is a severe storm which traps the guests on the island and soon dead bodies begin to appear.  As in Agatha Christie's &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, the people on the island begin to fear one another.  Demarkian, however, has the solution to the murders all figured out, and eventually he shares his findings with the guests.  Haddam is a good writer, and she creates interesting characters in a foreboding setting.  There are a few points of the plot which don't make much sense, but all in all, this is a a good read.	2004-02-01

It is the story of 10 seemingly unrelated people who are lured to an isolated island under false pretenses.  A copy of the poem &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; is posted and there are 10 figurines representing each Indian.  Soon, deaths begin to occur and each time a figurine is smashed or disappears.  The guests soon come to the conclusion that nine of them will die and the perpetrator is the only person who will survive.  They begin to regard one another with suspicion and they all fear for their lives.  Each person has a secret to hide and each has been directly or indirectly responsible for the downfall of another human being.  This cleverly crafted novel will keep you riveted and puzzled at the same time.  It is definitely one of Agatha Christie's best works.	2004-01-29

The book shows an unlikely relationship between the two, first as co-leads in a play, but later as something much more.  Nicholas Sparks displays an uncanny ability to climb inside his 17-year-old main character's head and make him sound real.  He delves into themes of life, death, and faith with a deft hand and leaves the reader with a lot to think about.  This is definitely one of Sparks' best books.	2004-01-29

Elizabeth Buchan writes with uncommon insight and great compassion about the unraveling of a 25-year-old marriage.  Rose is blissfully happy in her empty nest and feels fulfillment through her marriage to Nathan and her job as a book reviewer.  Her shock is complete when Nathan informs her quietly one night that he has &quot;found someone else.&quot;  The someone else turns out to be Rose's assistant, Minty, who soon takes her job as well as her husband.  Rose goes through the usual stages of despair, anger, and depression, but eventually finds great strength and determination within herself.  Author Buchan does not fall back on the usual cliches of the single woman being rescued by a fabulous new job or a returning swain, but instead forces her character to dig deep within her own resources to create a new life for herself.  Nathan, on the other hand, realizes too late what he has given up.  Reading this book certainly makes me want to read others by this author.	2004-01-20

It is the story of the birth of a city, Los Angeles, which coincides with the settling of the area by two prominent families, the Deanes and the Van Vliets.  Through marriage, these two families merge and produce adventurous men who gamble everything on risky business ventures and beautiful women.  The Van Vliets take center stage, and the story follows the lives of two brothers, Bud and V3 (short for Vincente.)  The older brother Bud is a confident, take-charge sort who intimidates his more introverted younger brother, V3.  The younger man always feels that he is in his brother's shadow and so he constantly strives to match Bud in business and in love.  This inevitably pits the two brothers against one another, and their sibling rivalry results in rash actions which have consequences on each succeeding generation of the family.  The background setting of early Los Angeles is the perfect one for this epic novel, and the well-developed plot and characters make this 25-year-old book one which deserves to be rediscovered by today's readers.	2004-01-18

The discovery of a dead body at Double Dives brings Father John into an investigation, just as his friend Vicky is offered a job at the Indian reservation's gambling casino.  Vicky has her doubts about the casino job, but she is convinced by Adam Lone Eagle, the other attorney at the casino that it would be beneficial to her people.  Vicky has been barely making ends meet in her law practice, so she agrees to join Adam.  As she learns more about the operation, Vicky becomes suspicious about the legality of some of its practices.  The human side of gambling problems is revealed when one of Father John's employees becomes enmeshed in gambling debts.  The delicate balancing act of Vicky and Father John's relationship is again addressed in this book, and the possibility of a new romance for Vicky causes them to face some issues that they have chosen to ignore in the past.  The beautiful background of the Wyoming reservation, the well-defined characters, and the tightly-woven plot are all typical of this series.	2004-01-15

In a departure from the norm, Mrs. Boynton suggests a trip to Jerusalem and brings her family with her.  They are accompanied by a family friend, two physicians, two ladies, and Hercule Poirot.  Poirot overhears two of the adult Boynton children plotting to kill their mother and he uses this evidence as a beginning to investigate the eventual murder of the old lady.

His neer-do-well father was a poor role model, while his adored mother had her own problems.  His brother was a drug addict, his wife ridiculed him for his passive attitude toward life,and as a result she decided to divorce him.  Years ago he felt compelled to leave college in order to come home and tend to his dying mother, but she rejected his help and criticized him for not completing his education, and fulfilling his potential.  The light of his life is his daughter Tick, but she hangs out with some of the social outcasts in her high school and seems not be confused by life.  Miles is the manager of the local diner which is owned by the scheming and manipulative Mrs. Whiting who owns half the town and who bullies people to do her bidding.  At the diner we meet the other characters who live in Empire Falls--Walt, the buffoon who is engaged to marry Miles soon-to-be-ex-wife; Max, Miles' father; Otis, the local high school principal, and many others.  Through the everyday interactions of the book's characters and the history of this once-prosperous but now-depressed community, Russon weaves in a variety of themes: sacrificial love, a man's coming of age, redemption, justice, class struggle, and a host of others.  With his sly humor and no-nonsense writing, Russo captures the reader's heart and mind.  The only weakness is the plethora of violent actions which take place at the end which are not worthy of the atmosphere set earlier in the book.	2003-12-21

Soon the investigators decide that the drink may have been intended for Marina because a long line of ex-husbands and betrayed wives would have a motive to kill her.  Miss Marple puzzles over the possible suspects and does some interviewing until she finally decides who the culprit is.  This is another one of Agatha Christie's carefully constructed novels which challenge the reader to solve the mystery before Miss Marple.  Not the best of the books, but a good read nevertheless.	2003-12-09

The first incident involves Sean King who is distracted momentarily while protecting a presidential candidate who is then killed.  The second involves another presidential candidate who is out of sight of Agent Michelle Maxwell just long enough to be kidnapped.  The two former agents join forces to try to find out who is behind these incidents.  The plot becomes convoluted and complex as many people seem to have a motive for masterminding the kidnapping and the murder, but nothing seems to tie the two together.  A third person enters the picture as King's former lover Joan joins the investigation.  Baldacci is a slick writer and he knows how to weave a web of plot and then to unravel it when the moment is right.  The ending does stretch credibility, but suspending disbelief has its rewards in an entertaining read.	2003-12-02

Ruth had recently visited with Carrie Louise, and something in the household did not seem right.  She persuades Miss Marple to visit Carrie Louise herself to see if she can detect what's wrong.  When she arrives, Jane discovers that Carrie's home has been turned into a haven for delinquent boys by her husband.  Soon a murder occurs and the plot thickens.  Although professional investigators are called on the scene, Miss Marple exhibits her famous powers of deduction and comes up with a solution before they do.

When Vicky investigates, she encounters denials by museum officials that such a ledger ever existed.  She theorizes that there is a cover-up because the ledger would reveal that Arapahos were part of an Indian massacre in which the descendants were promised land.  The Cherokees try to claim that they were the only people to be killed at the battle.  Meanwhile Father John O'Malley returns to the reservation after a month-long sabattical during which he renewed his priestly vows and his resolve not to become involved with Vicky on an emotional level.  Soon he is caught up in the murder of a young Arapaho and his path crosses Vicky's while he is investigating.  As usual, the two pair up and try to solve the mysterious events occuring in Denver and on the reservation in Wyoming.  Father John and Vicky possess a depth which many characters in mysteries lack.  Another plus to this series is the information on Indian culture which is portrayed so well in these books.	2003-11-26

She is being romanced by two men, Richard, a handsome and charming engineer, and Mike, the down-to-earth mechanic who was her husband's best friend.  When she chooses Mike as a steady date, Richard begins to act in a bizarre fashion and his actions frighten Julie.  She and Mike have a hard time convincing police that Richard is a danger to them, and so the stalking behavior continues.

They become acquainted with one of their favorite authors, but also meet some less pleasant members of the writing fraternity.  Among them are the chauvinistic critic Zac Zebra, and the obnoxiously aggressive Vernetta Strausmann who is pushing her self-published and poorly-written mystery.  Also there is a woman who calls herself Ms. Mystery who listens in on people's conversations and then puts the gossip she gathers onto her website.  When Zac is attacked and editor Sophie Smith becomes violently ill, Jane and Shelley's radar goes up and they begin to investigate.  This book remarkably has no bloodshed or dead bodies, but the mysteries it does contain are not exactly riveting.  Also this book lacks the laugh-out-loud humor which was so endearing in the earlier entries in the series.	2003-11-22

Meanwhile Vicky is working to oppose a transaction which would allow a ranch to be turned over to a company which will use it for a nuclear storage site.  More people die, and Father John is afraid that Vicky will be next.  There are abductions, car chases, and other scarey moments while the Jesuit priest and the Arapaho attorney pursue the murderer.  There are also the usual glimpses into the Arapaho culture which always enrich Margaret Coel's books.  This is another good entry to this series.	2003-11-21

When she discovers that she is pregnant, she finds little support from her fiance, her family, or her college and she is pressured by many of them to have an abortion.  There is no doubt where Francine Rivers stands on the subject of abortion.  She is squarely against it and she uses everything in her writing arsenal to put across that point.  Even while agreeing with her viewpoint, I feel that she has not done the topic justice in this book.  The plot is very predictable from the very beginning and the characters are one-dimensional.  It seems as if every woman in the book has had an abortion at one time or another and that is not realistic.  There are several questions left unanswered at the end of the book.  Who will take care of Dynah's grandmother?  How much support will Dynah receive from her father?  How will Joe finish his education?  If you want to read better Francine Rivers books, I recommend her Women of the Bible series.	2003-11-20

Instead, he teams up with Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden, and tries to solve the murder while helping Vicky with her drug-addicted daughter, Susan.

Her gentle humor and all-too-human characters have been a delight to me over the years.  However, this book somehow misses the mark and it neither interests me nor tugs at my heart as the other Mitford books have done.  In this installment, Father Tim is re-doing a manger scene for Cynthia for Christmas.  Working with his hands is quite foreign to him so this is truly an effort of love.  The characters from the other books reappear here, but they are not fleshed out enough for a reader to be involved with them and the rapid movement from character to character is quite distracting.  Hopefully, any future Mitford books will return to the charming qualities which make these books so special.	2003-11-14

Father John O'Malley has been sent to the reservation after his battle with alcoholism during his previous post in Boston.  His struggles with drinking have given him insight into the alcohol problem which is so prevalent among the Arapahos that he serves.  Just before a festive powwow is to begin, Father John discovers the dead body of Harvey Castle, one of the tribal council members.  He teams up with an Arapaho attorney, named Vicki Holden, and the two begin an investigation in order to protect Harvey's nephew who has been accused of the murder.  Coel creates interesting characters, and both Father John and Vicki have past problems which give them more depth than many characters in mystery stories.  Coel also does a good job of portraying the Arapaho culture and adds interesting details about things such as funeral customs, &quot;Indian time&quot;, and the &quot;moccasin telegraph&quot;.  I look forward to reading the other books in this series.	2003-11-13

In their book, Robert Grant, a black candidate for re-election to the Senate from Georgia, is thwarted in his attempts by a giant conspiracy.  He is accused of adultery, drug dealing and murder and there is circumstantial evidence to back up each of these allegations.  His college-age son is also a target and he is framed for drug use and possession at a party given by his friends.  The characters in this book tend to be one-dimensional.  Grant is portrayed as an ethical man whose behavior is a model of perfection, while his enemies are totally evil, with no redeeming qualities.  The characters are either very good, very bad, or too weak to resist the evil around them.  The plot becomes quite unbelievable as the President of the U.S. orders that Grant be shot on sight and yet he is allowed to enter the offices of CNN and do a national broadcast.  Grant's son is betrayed by a close friend, but he embraces her despite the problems she has caused.  Fiction is obviously untrue, but it would be nice to think that at least the plot in a work of fiction is plausible.  This one is not!	2003-11-08

This book details the life of Barbara Bush from the time her husband left the White House until her son took office, with a short addendum about 9/11.  She describes the places she went, and the people she spent time with, as well as family events and world happenings.  She is not unlike many other active women her age, with the exception that her travels are to places like Egypt and Russian and she is always greeted by local dignitaries, royalty, government officials, or some of her very large circle of influential friends.  She is at her best when she describes her family members and get-togethers with her children and grandchildren.  All too often, her activities are listed in a rapid-fire manner without enough description and fleshing-out to make them vivid to the reader.  She has not lost her considerable wit which is turned on herself as often as it is on someone else.  She is a delightful, down-to-earth lady who, as she says, &quot;married well&quot;, but this book doesn't do justice to the life she has led in the past 10 years.	2003-11-05

The detective works with his friend Hastings, who is staying at Styles, and he methodically interviews each person in the house to ascertain the identity of the killer.  Poirot pays fastidious attention to every detail and painstakingly pieces together a solution, much to the consternation of Hastings, who is more impulsive and emotional when trying to solve a crime.

He knows the murderer's identity but will not reveal it to Hastings, and says he is counting on his old friend to help him prevent any further deaths.

Neely has his own demons, fostered by a long-hidden incident between him and his former coach.  He also has regrets about his shabby treatment of his first girlfriend and a football career that was short-circuited in college after a cheap shot from a defending player.  He talks to his old football buddies and a flood of memories returns, showing him how much his life has been impacted by his years on the football field.  His hometown reflects the positive and negative qualities of being football-obsessed, as do its former heroes.

Knowing that makes this book, her first published in 1925, even more poignant.  &quot;Herbs and Apples&quot; is semi-autobigraphical and while the story revolves around its main character, Derrick, it is narrated by one of her best friends, Sue.  Derrick is from a rather well-to-do family in the small fictional town of Tecumseh, Ohio.  She is a bright girl and is always the nominal leader among her group of friends.  They look up to her because of her intelligence and philosophical view of life as well as her writing talent.  She and her college friends proclaim their motto to be &quot;Down with Matrimony, up with Art, Fame before Forty or bust.  These idealistic women all plan to become famous or important for something, but, as Derrick discovers, Life has a few surprises in store and reality does not always allow a person to follow her dreams.  Although the book seems to be about a simpler time, the struggles and attempts to find one's self are certainly as serious and difficult as any in our current time.  This book is full of beautiful language and descriptions of Derrick's world, both internal and external.  It is a wonderful read for those who like to contemplate life and purpose.	2003-10-02

She hardly remembers her mother who was killed by unfortunate circumstances when she was small.  Lily knows that she had a part in the murder, but she's not quite sure what it was.  She is left in the care of her father, a hard man who is unable to show any affection towards his daughter.  The only loving person in her life is Rosaleen, a black servant, who treats Lily in a more kindly manner than her father does.  Lily is with Rosaleen when she is assaulted by some white men and then is put in jail for striking back at them.  While Rosaleen is in the hospital getting her wounds treated, Lily manages to sneak in and spirit her away.  They run away to Tiburon, the name of a town that her mother had written on the back of a picture of a black Madonna.  When they reach Tiburon, they discover that the black Madonna is the label from a certain brand of honey, so they go to the home where the honey is made.  There, they are taken in by 3 kindly black beekeepers--May, June, and August.  It is there that Lily is able to heal from her unhappy childhood and to come to terms with some of the longings in her life.  There are several themes in the book, the most obvious one being the pursuit of a mother by Lily.  Mothers are compared to the queen bee, who is an integral part of the honeymaking of the three sisters.  Madonna, another mother figure, is revered by the Catholic ladies of the household.  There are also common references to race relations when outsiders criticize Lily for staying in a home with black people.  There are regrets and there is redemption.  This is a multi-layered debut novel which holds a lot of promise for future work from this author.	2003-09-23

Interviews with his parents and others who knew him lead them nowhere.  Meanwhile there are some scenes between Alex, his current love interest, Allison, and Robin, his ex-girlfriend.  Alex and Robin seem to have ambivalent feelings towards each other and these are not completely resolved in this book.  Milo's colleague Petra has a new partner whose unusually stoic personality inspires some curiosity on the part of his co-workers.

Johnny is living with Kate Shugak, a private investigator who was once romantically involved with Johnny's father Jack, and who promised him that she would take care of Johnny after Jack's death.  Kate helps Alaska State Trooper Jim Chopin investigate the case.  When Kate's life is threatened, Jim decides to fire her for her own protection, but to no avail.  As always, this is an interesting mystery set in the beautiful Alaskan area near Prince William Sound.  Stabenow hits all of the right notes in portraying the off-again-on-again relationship between Kate and Jim and shows us a softer side of Kate as she relates to Johnny and her friends.  The final chapter in the book is a warm portrayal of the Alaskan spirit when people go out of their way to help their neighbors.  This is one of my favorite books in this wonderful series.	2003-09-16

Readers know what will happen within the first 30 pages of her books, but they still clamor to read the numerous mini-series which she has written.  In this book, Seth Quinn returns to his home and family on Chesepeake Bay after honing his artistic skills in Paris for several years.  He meets a beautiful woman named Dru Whitcomb (on p. 30) and begins his pursuit of her.  She has been betrayed by a man she was engaged to and is understandably reluctant to enter another romantic relationship.  Seth has his own secrets, especially his dysfunctional mother who haunts him with demands for blackmail money in return for her keeping their sordid past a secret.  This is a cut above some of Roberts' books, but is still pretty predictable.	2003-09-11

The Flynn's bed-and-breakfast is being redone, and it seems like the perfect time for them to get out of town.  Renie is scheduled to attend a conference at the Stillasnowamish Casino, so she invites the others to come along.  The Flynns are building another B &amp; B on family property near the casino, so this seems like the perfect solution to all of these situations.<BR>Judith, Renie, and their husbands attend a magic show put on by the Great Madolini and they are amazed by the illusions in the show.  Unfortunately, Judith soon discovers the dead body of the magician's assistant.  Things go from bad to worse when her contractor at home keeps calling her about things that are going wrong, and the contractors on the new B &amp; B seem to be digging the foundation in the wrong place.  Of course, Judith cannot resist a good murder mystery and she and Joe make a wager about whether she can solve it by a deadline that Joe gives her.  This is a good addition to the Bed-and-Breakfast Mystery series and it has some twists at the end that add a lot of interest to the story.	2003-09-08

Texas is a huge state with a rich multicultural heritage.  It takes a real tour de force, such as David Marion Wilkinson's &quot;Not Between Brothers&quot; to do it justice.  In this epic view of Texas history, Wilkinson uses fictional characters Remy Fuqua and Comanche Indian Kills White Bear to tell the story of life on the frontier between the years 1816 and 1861.  Remy is a Scotch-Irish orphan who grows up in Louisiana and is permanently scarred by his unhappy childhood.  He carries a &quot;never-say-die&quot; attitude and a quick temper throughout his life.  Kills White Bear is a Comanche warrior who nurtures a hatred for the white people whose diseases rob him of many of his loved ones.  Remy and his cousin move to Texas where they negotiate a piece of land from Stephen F. Austin.  Remy meets and falls in love with a beautiful, wealthy Mexican woman, and this causes problems for both of them throughout the rest of their lives.  Remy and Kills Bear's lives weave their separate paths until at last they intersect, with predictable dire consequences for both of them.  Wilkinson's wonderful prose and unforgettable characters make for an excellent read.  He weaves in a lot of history and the reader is treated to up-close looks at Stephen F. Austin, Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, and others who are painted in wonderful shades of gray and who are not made to look like saints.  For anyone who enjoys historical fiction or who has an interest in Texas, this is highly recommended reading.	2003-09-05

While going into the gym, she discovers a local bodybuilder with a barbell across his neck.  This and other incidents lead Lily to believe that racial problems are getting out of hand in her adopted Arkansas town.  She teams up with a handsome detective and they search for the truth, almost afraid of what they may find out about their fellow townspeople.

His parents are killed and he inherits enough money to go to law school instead of becoming a teacher as he intended.  He puts off his marriage to his high school sweetheart and his entire life takes a different turn.  The author makes it very plain (no pun intended) that Robb's pursuit of money and prestige inevitably leads to his downfall.  The characters in this book are not as finely drawn or as sympathetic as many in Plain's other books and her message is pretty obviously made, but it's not a bad read.	2003-08-28

The novel is based on the Biblical account of Cain and Abel in the book of Genesis.  Steinbeck dwells on the sibling rivalry which pits one brother against another for their father's love.  This occurs in two generations with Charlie and Adam in the first generation and Adam's twin sons Cal and Aron in the second.  There are fascinating characters, such as the wicked Cathy who finds men's weaknesses and preys on them for her own gain, the wise and philosophical Chinese servant Lee, and the wonderful dreamer named Samuel Hamilton.  The Hamilton family is patterned after Steinbeck's maternal family and he sometimes takes side-trips to the plot in order to tell some family tale which has been passed on to him by oral tradition.  Another interesting theme has to do with dreamers, like Adam and Aron, who only see what they want to see, and realists, such as Samuel's wife, whose view is likewise narrowed by her practical nature.  Abra starts out as a dreamer, but grows into a woman who sees the greys in life and learns to accept them without letting them detroy her.  A favorite theme seems to deal with paternal expectations and how these can overpower and sometimes detroy a son.  Steinbeck delves into the question of inherited predisposition towards sin and resoundingly concludes that we all have choices and we are not driven totally by our genetic disposition.  This is a fascinating study of human nature and of good vs. evil and is a wonderful read.	2003-08-25

The police think they have found the man who did it and they are ready to close the case.  Peter Decker thinks otherwise and he spends the rest of the book trying to find out what was really behind the murders.  He looks into the family lives of some of the deceased and finds multiple motives for the murders.  Several family members stand to gain financially and personally from the deaths of their relatives.  Peter is accused of sexual harrassment when he interviews one of the suspects, and Rina stands by him when he is forced to defend himself.  This is another good entry in the series.	2003-08-19

In \\"Street Dreams\\", Peter's daughter Cindy takes center stage again, as she did in the earlier book, \\"Stalker\\".  This time she is a more well-rounded character and is more sympathetic despite her tough demeanor.  At the beginning of the book she is called by a man who hears a strange noise coming out of a dumpster.  Cindy investigates and finds a newborn baby whom she rescues.  She then sets out to find the mother and father of the baby.  While doing so, she becomes acquainted with a male neonatal nurse who is destined to have a major role in Cindy's life.  During her investigation she is followed and shot at, actions which only increase her street dreams--cops' nightmares of what could really happen to them.  She is also a witness to a brutal hit-and-run accident which she feels is related to her search for the baby's parents.  A subplot concerns Cindy's step-mother Rina who wants Peter to investigate the murder of her grandmother many years ago during a time of Jewish persecution.  Cindy's romance is a classic dance of drawing closer and then moving apart due to miscommunication and misunderstood motives.  There are some innuendos in the book which seem to go nowhere, such as Cindy and Peter's uneasy state of mind at the beginning of the book and the dark moods of Cindy's friend Koby.  Perhaps this is intentional and Kellerman will develop these strands more fully in later novels.  The crimes in this book seem to take a back seat to the personal lives of the characters but that makes this book very readable and does help the character development, particularly with Cindy.  Kellerman fans should not be disappointed in this latest entry in the series.	2003-08-19

In this third book of the series Bubbles is looking forward to a romantic getaway with Stiletto at the Passion Peak Resort.  Before Steve arrives, however, Bubbles receives a fax from her editor directing her to cover a story at an abandoned mine.  She finds an injured Steve and the body of another man.  There is an explosion and from there on the action is non-stop.  Strohmeyer populates her books with crazy characters, including Bubbles' mother and her cousin Stinky.  There are inevitable comparisons between the writing of Sarah Strohmeyer and Janet Evanovich but surely there is room for two comical heroines who manage to solve the mystery and catch the bad guy at the end of a fun-filled tale.

In this novel, a young man named Peter Mullen is brutally killed while parking cars at a millionaire's beach house.  The police do a hasty investigation and declare that Peter's death is due to suicide or an accident, but Peter's brother Jack knows better.  He is in law school and he uses all of his expertise to try to find out the truth.  Bad things begin to happen to Jack and his friends as he gets closer to solving the mystery of his brother's death.  The good news about this book is that it is very readable and the action moves along well.  The setting of East Hampton is an interesting one and the characters are generally well-drawn.  The problem is the plots twists at the end which are pretty hard to swallow.  If you can suspend your disbelief over the last 100 pages or so, this is an enjoyable read.	2003-08-09

This book illustrates the delicate balancing act she performs, but it seems that her worklife takes precedence over her homelife.  She spends very little time at home because she's trying to solve the murder of Carol Mossman, a hoarder of animals whose 17 dogs die with her.  Joanna becomes embroiled with Mossman's family and delves into its ugly secrets in order to solve the murder.  Along with this, Joanna is faced with a large number of undocumented aliens who have come across the border from Mexico and who have been killed or injured in a bad car accident.  There are political implications in this book, too, because Joanna is running for sheriff and each one of her actions seems to bring forth a new protest group.  She could never pull all of this off without the help of Butch, her selfless stay-at-home husband who takes care of hearth, home, and Joanna's daughter while she is performing her duties as sheriff.  There are some developments on the homefront plus the election which are not settled in this book and are a perfect lead-in for the next book in this dependable series.	2003-08-07

There are actually two stories, told in parallel fashion about Sylvia Bergstrom Compson and her mother Eleanor.  Sylvia is about to be married to her beau Andrew and before this momentous event, she has some unfinished business.  She decides to look for five quilts which her mother Eleanor made when she was a young child.  Her mother died when she was young, so she had never had time to get to know her well, but she wanted the quilts as her mother's legacy.  Eleanor's story revolves around her delicate health and the difficult relationship she had with her critical, overbearing mother.  Eleanor and her sister both defied their mother's wishes when choosing husbands, and her mother never forgave them for what she viewed as rebellion.  These stories weave in and out as Sylvia pursues her mother's quilts and the end product is a very satisfying read.  This book can stand alone, but it will probably make more sense, particularly with regard to the minor characters, if you read the other 4 books in the series first.	2003-08-03

The murder of a museum curator occurs in the Louvre during the first chapter.  As the man is dying, he leaves a series of convoluted clues which his granddaughter Sophie and an historical symbologist named Robert Landgon, spend the rest of the book trying to follow.  What is their objective?  The Holy Grail, which is given a different spin in this book.  While there are historical rumors about the nature of the Grail, not as the chalice used by Christ at the Last Supper but as something quite different, this book's fictional plot is based on shaky conjecture.  It is well-written and the plots weaves deliciously around so that yesterday's allies are today's enemies.  Despite its strengths, this book is on shaky ground and it was hard for me, as a Christian, to accept the basic premise.	2003-07-31

In this, the 10th. book of the series, she tells parallel stories of heroine Benni Harper.  One of the stories takes place in 1978 when Benni is married to young rancher, Jack Harper, and the second relates incidents in 1995 when Benni is married to Gabe, the local chief of police.  Prominent in both stories is Emma Baldwin, an author whom Benni had admired in her younger days, and whom she interviewed for<BR>a paper when she was in college.  Another character is Luke, a friend of Gabe's whom he used to work with and who is back in town to visit.  Fowler carefully weaves these stories together, much like a quilt pattern, and emerges with a well-told tale which has unsuspected connections at the end.	2003-07-25

The Stephanie Plum novels are not so much about the mystery as they are about the crazy characters who cavort across the pages of these delightful books.  Janet Evanovich is back with all of our favorites and they get themselves into some very interesting situations.  Stephanie's boss, her cousin Vinnie, is in trouble because of the disappearance of Samuel Singh, an illegal immigrant for whom Vinnie has posted bail.  Vinnie assigns Stephanie the job of finding and apprehending Singh, which becomes even more fun when the trail leads to Las Vegas where Stephanie is accompanied by her pals Lula and Connie.  Dead bodies begin to accumulate and it is assumed that the killer is the same person since each murder is accompanied by flowers.  Stephanie receives threats and it appears that she is the next one on the killer's list.  My favorite character is Lula and she is at her best as she goes on a high-protein diet in her quest to be a supermodel.  Never mind that her idea of a diet is 7 cheeseburgers (without the bun) or a half-dozen pork chops at one sitting.  The girls stir up some big trouble in Las Vegas, and this book lives up to its predecessors on the laughter scale.  Enjoy!	2003-07-23

Within the monastery are unforgettable characters whom she paints with a loving and compassionate hand, showing both their sins and their unbelievable acts of love and sacrifice for God and their fellow man.  The main character is Father Peregrine for whom the book is named.  Throughout his life as a monk, he develops from the shallow son of an overprivileged upbringing to a man of tremendous faith and compassion, and finally to a shell of a man wracked with physical problems and the aftereffects of an undeserved beating.  His interaction with his brothers gives us an example of Christlike love and behavior and likewise his sufferings show us the physical tortures which Jesus endured.

This book is written through the eyes of Dr. James Sheppard, who has been called when his patient, Roger Ackroyd, is murdered.  Dr. Sheppard has recently lost a patient named Mrs. Ferrars who was engaged to the deceased.  Before her death, <BR>she confided some personal information to Dr. Sheppard which gave him an inside track on the identity of the murderer.  The victim's adopted son Roger, seems like a likely suspect, so his fiance Flora hires a retired detective, Hercule Poirot, to find the real killer.  In his precise and logical way, Poirot does just that, uncovering the truth bit by bit as he interviews the possible suspects.  They are all present--the family members who stand to gain financially from Ackroyd's death, the butler, the efficient private secretary, the housekeeper, the parlor maid, and a mysterious stranger.  Only one of them is guilty and Poirot works his magic in this cleverly convoluted story.  It is amazing to see that this book was written in 1926 and it is just as interesting today as it was almost 80 years ago.	2003-07-15

Her sled dogs are farmed out to a friend for training and the only dog she has kept with her is her lead dog, Tank.  Feeling very bored, Jessie receives an invitation to help out with a booth at the Alaska State Fair.  She agrees, and soon she and Tank are in the middle of things at this busy event.  A death occurs, and people become concerned about their safety.  Meanwhile a young boy and a senior citizen steal away from their respective homes and join forces to elude their captors.  Most of the story is told by flashbacks which definitely detract from the suspense since the reader already knows that the characters are safe.  Author Henry brings back a former lover of Jessie's but somehow, her instant acceptance of him, despite a long absence, does not ring true.  Having just returned from a trip to Alaska, I was looking forward to the author's usual wonderful descriptions of this area, but I was disappointed that this particular book was lacking in that respect.  I gave the book 3 stars because it  lacks the suspense and the vivid descriptions of others in the series.	2003-07-10

To that end, each generation has inched its way closer to the dream of a college education.  In her son's family, Luke, the eldest child, has received a scholarship to attend teachers' college and  to realize the dreams of his ancestor.  Tragedy occurs, however, and Luke must put off going to college to help his family.  His dreams are passed on to his brother Matt who wanders the ponds of Crow Lake with little sister Kate (the book's narrator) while he teaches her everything he knows about the little creatures within the pond.  In turn, Matt's dreams are shattered and Kate is left to fulfill the family's desire for an education.  Sadly, this very education serves to separate her from the siblings who were once the center of her world.  When she is invited back to Crow Lake for her nephew's birthday, she is forced to face old demons and to have a meeting between her current life, as exemplified by her boyfriend Daniel, and her past, represented by her family.  This brief description does little to convey the power of this beautiful novel which is all about the things that matter most to us--family, careers, and priorities in our lives.  This is a wonderful book and I look forward to reading more from this inspiring author.	2003-07-02

James has a very good reputation as a mystery writer so I was anxious to read some of her books.  This is the first one I tried and I found it very dry reading indeed!  The story takes place in the home of a wealthy couple in England who have hired a young unmarried mother named Sally Jupp to come and work in their household.  She and the son in the household come to announce to everyone that they are engaged to be married.  When the announcement is made, there are unhappy family members and a jealous woman who had hoped to marry the man herself.<BR>Inspector Dalgliesh arrives and finds even more people who have a motive to murder Sally.  He interviews each person and it seems that each one is hiding something.  Of course, at the end, the truth is revealed and there are several people who have a small piece to the puzzle of who the murderer is.  The mystery is well-constructed, but the writing style makes it difficult to stay interested and to follow the story line.

The initial tragedy of Susie's death gives rise to succeeding tragedies which she watches helplessly from heaven.  She cannot stop visiting Earth until there is closure to some of the issues which her family and friends face.  There are universal themes of love and redemption which run throughout the book and this may be what has been so appealing to readers.  There are two things which keep me from liking this book as much as the 5-star reviewers.  The first is that after seeing it atop the Best Seller list for months, I felt that it would be an extraordinary book, but for me it wasn't.  Secondly, the heaven<BR>which Alice Sebold describes is not one that I, as a Christian, can identify with.  In her book, heaven is different things to different people and seems to be centered on the individual's preferences in life rather than a central deity.  There is no God mentioned and no joy from being with the creator and sustainer of life.  Because of this, I had a hard time accepting some of the other premises of the book.  On the upside, it was well-written and Sebold has the ability to create interesting characters.	2003-06-21

Peter's biological brother's brother-in-law (are you following me here?) is killed and his niece is missing.  Peter is called from LA to help the family, yet every time he tries, he is rebuffed by them.  He and Rina are supposed to go to see his parents in Florida but Peter keeps putting this off to work on the case.  (I have a lot more trouble changing airline tickets than Rina seems to.)  Besides the plot being somewhat a rehash, there is also the return of Chris Denotti, a psycho killer and sexual predator who needs to disappear from the series but who seems to be set up in this book to return again.  Also the relationship between Peter, his adopted brother and his biological brother is revisited, but there are no new insights.  The plot is dark and somewhat complex and is not as satisfying as most of the other books in the series.  Still, Kellerman fans should probably give this one a chance.	2003-06-20

Unfortunately, she has a bit of an attitude and her fellow officers are not happy about that or about the fact that her father is a lieutenant.  Things begin happening to her which confuse and frighten her.  First it's small things, like verbal jibes, and then it becomes things that are out of place in her apartment, and then more serious occurrences.  Out of pride, Cindy tries to handle these incidents herself instead of asking for her father's help.  This makes her appear more foolish than brave and certainly does nothing to endear her to readers.  Things go from bad to worse until the stalker threatens her life.  This is an average book in comparison to the other outstanding ones in the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series and just goes to show that Cindy is not as riveting a central character as her father and stepmother are.	2003-06-16

This gentle story of Sal and her mother and Little Bear and his mother picking blueberries on the mountain is one of her favorites.  There is enough repetition in the story that I can pause and my granddaughter will fill in with \\"Kerplink, kerplank, kerplunk\\" or whatever other words fit in the story.  Losing one's mother and getting lost are great concerns for children, so the happy ending of this classic is very appealing to little ones.  This is a highly recommended children's book.	2003-06-13

The deceased was a well-known astophysicist named Emil Ganz who had disappeared and then surfaced as Father Jupiter, the leader of the cult.  His death is reported to the police by his daughter, Europa, who is not involved with the cult but who had followed her father's footsteps into his occupation.  When Decker and the LAPD try to investigate the death, Jupiter's four lieutenants try to stonewall their efforts.  Soon there is another death, and some disappearances from the compound where the cult lives.  Decker and his cohorts are horrified as they uncover the secrets of the Order of the Rings.  Peter's longtime partner Marge plays a pivotal role in an exciting rescue attempt at the end of the book where the action really peaks.  Peter also discovers some long-hidden secrets about his stepsons, but as usual, his homelife takes second place to his professional one.  This is another good entry to the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus Series from the gifted writer, Faye Kellerman.	2003-06-13

She finds him an attractive man until she discovers that he plans to build a 5-star hotel which will be in direct competition with her PennDutch Inn.  When the colonel is found dead, there are no end of suspects in Hernia, because many of the townspeople opposed the new hotel which they felt would change the slow pace of the town which they had always enjoyed.  Interspersed with the mystery are humorous interludes with a 25-foot snake and Magdalena's intrepid fiance, <BR>Gabe.  As usual, it is up to Magdalena to solve the mystery because the town's policeman, her brother-in-law, is not up to the task.  This book will not disappoint Tamar Myers' fans.	2003-06-10

The language and character development by author Glass was well done, but at the same time the characters were so full of angst that I wanted to shout at them, &quot;Lighten up!  Life is not meant to be so tortured.&quot;  The story covers three summers (or Junes) in the lives of a Scottish family.  The first part describes the life and marriage of Paul McLeod.  Although it was interesting, it didn't seem to be developed fully enough.  The next section, about Paul's eldest son Fenno, was longer than necessary and seemed to drag in parts.  The last part was about Fern, a woman who was important in Paul's life and seemed to be destined to become a big part of Fenno's as well.  Their relationship developed unrealitically quickly and seemed to magically defuse all of the doubts which had tortured Fern for many years.  The author has real potential, but will hopefully be less heavy-handed in future novels.	2003-06-09

My first advice to the reader would be to finish this book, even though it's difficult and confusing at times.  It's worth it to see how masterfully Margaret Atwood manages to weave together disparate elements of the story into a beautiful tapestry.<BR>This book has four story elements going at one time and is amazingly complex.  The first story is a narrative by Iris Chase, an ailing octagenarian who writes briefly about her current life but who concentrates on telling the history of her and her younger sister Laura.  Then the story shifts to a book called \\"The Blind Assassin\\" in which a young woman meets secretly with her lover and he spins tales for her about imaginary planets and ancient kingdoms.  This is a bit intimidating to the reader at times, but wading through this book is worth it to see how it all comes out at the end.  Atwood writes with frank but beautiful prose and comes up with some startling lines such as \\"Time rises and rises, and when it reaches the level of your eyes you drown\\".  If you want a bit of a stretch in your reading and you appreciate complex plots and characters, this may be the book for you.	2003-06-05

Faith is chagrined to realize that Tom's idea and her idea as to what constitutes a house ready to move into, are two different things.  Tom has been working diligently with a crew of men to finish up their house, but it's not yet ready for human habitation.  Faith's best friend's mother, Ursula, kindly invites them to move in with her until their home is finished.  Faith welcomes the opportunity to live in comfortable surroundings and to get to know Ursula better.  The elderly woman confides in Faith that all is not well on the island.  There is a battle between those who want to Keep Sanpere Sanpere (KSS) and those who want to develop it and thus remove the wilderness from the area.  Things begin to happen to those who oppose the new developments and soon graffiti begins to appear on the island.  One of the island realtors accidentally drinks some turpentine while preparing for a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and one of the major developers is found dead in the island's lighthouse.  All signs point to one of the members of KSS, but there is no proof.  Along with these disagreements, there is an ongoing struggle between two island families over lobster fishing rights.  There are so many suspects that Faith is at a loss as to who might be responsible until the killer confesses to her.  This is another good read from Katherine Hall Page which contains interesting information about the origins of lighthouses as well as a good mystery.	2003-06-02

J.W. Jackson and his wife Zee resist the efforts of Fox's company Saberfox to buy their house.  Coincidentally, they are in a nearby restaurant when Fox's brother Paul is shot.  Fortunately Paul is wearing a bullet-proof vest and he recovers from the attack, but J.W. is still a minor suspect in the shooting because of his dealings with Saberfox and his proximity to the shooting.  Meanwhile another of the Vineyard's inhabitants asks J.W. to find out more about the man who is courting her mother.  She has no objections to her mother having a relationship, but wants to make sure that the man is an honorable person.  J.W. sets out on his investigation, and suddenly finds himself being followed by Saberfox employees.  Philip Craig weaves these two plots together and throws in some of the Jacksons' family time to create another good read in his Vineyard series.  As usual, he includes some recipes in the back of the book and uses Martha's Vineyard as the appealing background for his novel.	2003-05-29

The battle rages and the cost is high.  Several members of the Tribulation Force who have been waiting for the Glorious Appearance of Jesus with great anticipation, are not allowed to live long enough to see it.  This 11th. book of the series is more intimate (closely following the capture and imprisonment of a prominent character) and more compelling (with descriptions of the events leading up to and beginning the battle) than in the most recent books.  The authors are not the best writers in the world, but they do tell an important story in terms that 21st. century people can understand.  They seem to be meeting a need of the reading public because these books consistantly top the best-seller list.	2003-05-28

Lieutenant Peter Decker is called in on the case and he discovers that the doctor fathered some very dysfunctional children who stood to benefit from their father's life insurance policy.  To complicate matters, Dr. Sparks was developing a controversial new drug, and several people had a motive to disrail his research.  A third complication is Dr. Sparks' unlikely association with a motorcycle gang with whom he rode on weekends.  As always, Faye Kellerman weaves disparate threads into an interesting pattern and intertwines Peter Decker's professional and personal lives.  In this book Peter's wife Rina has an unusual connection with one of the murder suspects and this creates some tension between the two of them.  This is another winner from Faye Kellerman.	2003-05-25

He is married to a woman named Crystal at the time of his disappearance.  Kinsey investigates several motives, including some shady financial dealings at his work and an unhappy marriage.  A second plot revolves around Kinsey's plans to rent office space from two brothers, who are hiding a grisly secret.  The search for Dr. Purcell occupies most of the book, and Kinsey finds a lot of dead ends as she investigates his family and business connections.  The relationship with the two brothers is more suspenseful but that subplot ends in a rather [bad] and unsatisfying manner.  The solution to the disappearance of Dr. Purcell moves very slowly until the end, when Kinsey has a sudden revelation, seemingly something she had not considered during her investigation.  Though not the best book of the series, this one is still a good read.	2003-05-12

There are the requisite number of chases, strange-looking people following them, adventures and misadventures for this book to join the others in the enjoyable Mrs. Pollifax series.  The one thing that puzzles me is why Dorothy Gilman had her heroine marry Cyrus in one of the early books and then have him serve as background, always off on his own business when Emily does another assignment for the CIA.  Perhaps she received negative feedback from readers when Cyrus accompanied her on one of her adventures, but it seems too bad to shove such a nice man into the background.	2003-05-08

He is a former CIA agent who is now an art dealer and he has been asked to authenticate the signature of Julius Caesar on a document.  In the process of doing so, he has been chased and shot at and he is currently in hiding.  Mrs. Pollifax shows up with a young woman named Kate who has been assigned to help her.  When they have trouble finding a safe haven, Kate takes them to her aunt's house.  Mrs. Pollifax finds all sorts of interesting activities going on there and learns more about the people who are chasing Farrell.  This story has the amusing complication of having Carstairs assign a person to follow and protect Mrs. Pollifax.  She is not aware of this and she levels the poor man with a well-placed karate chop.

As a favor to him, she promises to look at a case in the small town of Nota Lake, where a detective named Tom Newquist has just died of a heart attack.  His widow feels that her husband died under suspicious circumstances and that she cannot rest until she finds out what really happened.  Kinsey decides to take the case and begins interviewing the local people who might be involved.  They turn out to be an unfriendly bunch and before she knows it, she suffers some injuries at the hands of a mysterious attacker.  That's just the beginning, and before long Kinsey feels like a real outcast among the citizens of the tiny town.  She continues to investigate to see what really prompted Tom's death and whether there was foul play involved.  This book is a little more predictable than some in the series, but Kinsey's adventures always make for a good read.	2003-05-05

Farrell and Mrs. P. go through the requisite chases, shootings, and beatings until a happy conclusion is reached.

When Kadi arrives in Ubandiba, she becomes the target of an old enemy, and Mrs. Pollifax does her best to protect the young girl.

She tries to help the girl get away, but the pursuers are right on her tail, so she appeals to Carstairs, her CIA contact, who sends her to a &quot;safe house&quot;.  Much to her surprise the safe house turns out to be a carnival and Mrs. Pollifax and Kadi learn some new skills to become part of their new environment.  Someone who is also on the run and is hiding in the carnival is badly beaten and Mrs. Pollifax has a  new angle to explore.  This is all tied in with Kadi's friendship with a young man from a small African country and the disappearance of a wealthy American businessman.  Before it's over, Mrs. P. and Kadi are whisked to Africa and new problems surface before a satisfactory ending is achieved.  This is a delightful romp with the intrepid 60-something heroine and most of it is set in the United States, a nice change of pace from her other adventures.	2003-04-30

She uses a true story as the basis of her book, and while this sounds like a good idea, somehow it just doesn't work.  Kinsey is asked by her friend Lieutenant Dolan to help solve an old murder in which he and his friend Stacey Oliphant discovered a body which had never been identified by any name other than Jane Doe.  Stacey is having health problems and Dolan figures that a little police work is all it will take to pull him out of the doldrums.  (Where's the reasoning there?)  Grafton throws in a few scenes with the estranged members of Kinsey's family, but nothing seems to work in this slow-moving book.  The characters are shallow and I never really cared whether Jane Doe or her murderer was ever revealed.  I live in hope that Grafton will do better on \\"R\\".	2003-04-29

In this eighth book of the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series, Kellerman concentrates on another character's point of view as much as she does on Decker's.  She tells the story of Terry, a hard-working young high school girl whose father and step-mother expect her to keep house, babysit her younger sister, and maintain top grades.  She is asked to tutor Chris Whitman, a young man who runs with the popular crowd and happens to be related to an important Mafia figure.  She enters a world of lies and intrigue, where the only thing which remains somewhat constant is Chris's obsession with Terry.  Despite this, he maintains sexual relations with other girls and treats Terry with the utmost respect.  One of his sexual partners is killed, and Decker quickly closes in on Chris as the chief suspect.  This book is loaded with twists and turns, and stories within stories.  It deals with police politics, race relations, and gangland justice, and is a very satisfying read.  Congratulations to Faye Kellerman who outdoes herself on this wonderful and complex book.	2003-04-25

Lisa Beamer writes about the childhoods and upbringing of herself and her husband Todd, and how their faith in God influenced every decision they made.  She describes their meeting, courtship, marriage, and parenthood and shows her husband to be a strong Christian.  His biggest weakness seemed to be a tendency to work too hard and spend too little time with his family, but the Beamers worked out this problem with the help of Todd's Christian friends, who kept him accountable for a more balanced lifestyle.  Lisa describes how she first learned of the terrible tragedy which claimed her husband's life, and how she survived the difficult days after September 11.  She shows how Christian friends stepped in to help her, as a grateful nation showered her with notes, prayers, and gifts for her unborn baby.  She tells about her meetings with President Bush and famous members of the media, such as Larry King.  She also tells the intensely personal moments of having to go through family holidays and the birth of her daughter without her husband at her side.  Lisa's faith was tested and strengthened by events over which she had no control, because ultimately she knew WHO was in control.  This is a wonderful and inspiring book.	2003-04-18

She tries unsuccessfully to detect her future partner and is very surprised when the agent's identity is revealed.  She sees a lot of interesting Chinese countryside and tries to get acquainted with other tour group members.  Later in the book, she rides a runaway horse and encounters some rough stuff from a Russian spy.  This book, as the others in the series, is charming, and a little romance adds some pizzazz to this one.	2003-04-03

Jillian is the only child of a wealthy judge, while Leslie is one of five children of an alcoholic man and his long-suffering wife.  The story is told through diary entries, newspaper articles, report cards, police reports, and letters.  Although I thought this might be a distracting format, it worked well and author Macomber uses the different kinds of written material with great skill.  Throughout the book, the reader sees decisions, both bad and good, which the two women make and how these decisions effect their later lives.  It is an absorbing tale, and makes for a very good read.	2003-03-29

Rina is surprised because they hasn't been in close contact with Honey in recent years, but she agrees to the visit.  Meanwhile Peter works with his partner Marge on a case involving an entire family who have suddenly vanished.  The husband is a diamond dealer, and there are many motives for a possible murder, most of them having to do with money.  Coincidentally, after Honey comes to the Lazarus home, her husband, also a diamond dealer, is mysteriously killed.  Peter's quest for the truth in these matters eventually takes him and Rina to Israel where they pursue missing persons from both of these cases.  As usual, author Kellerman weaves interesting facts about the orthodox Jewish religion as well as Peter and Rina's evolving family life.  The trip to Israel adds an extra dimension to the story, and the total package is very satisfying for a mystery reader.	2003-03-27

I was very interested in this young man's personal story, but the technical parts were beyond my comprehension and I found myself skipping several chapters and parts of chapters.

The first was that her neighbor, who helped raise her after her parents' death, confides that their plane crash was not an accident, but was the result of a bomb which had been planted on the plane.  The second event is that Charlie's fiance, Drake, will soon be coming from Hawaii to move in with her.  This necessitates rearranging some of her things to make room for Drake and her discovery of some of her father's old papers in the attic.  Her father had been an employee of Sandia Corporation and had been privy to some confidential government information.  Working on the theory that her father had some incriminating evidence about someone at his job, Charlie begins interviewing his former co-workers and looking for answers to her questions about the plane crash.  Bad things begin happening to Charlie and the people she talks to, and the net begins to tighten around Charlie and the murderer.  This is another good entry in the Charlie Parker series.	2003-03-20

Sally is going to visit her friend, Laura, who has suffered a miscarriage.  About that same time Laura's friend Cynthia dies while having a miscarriage.  Laura suspects that Cynthia's abusive husband Richard has something to do with his wife's death.  The husband blames Cynthia's boss.  Charlie, not one to turn her back on a mystery, begins investigating and discovers the diabolical plot behind the death and miscarriages.  Author Connie Shelton throws in several issues in this book, including gun control and spousal abuse, but never really ties them together or makes them into a unified plot.  The actual solution to the crime is pretty far-fetched, as is the fact that Charlie's dog Rusty is allowed to stay in a jail cell with her.  There is also a visit from Charlie's love interest, Drake, and that relationship heats up during the course of the book.  Despite its flaws, this is still a pretty good book, with interesting characters and nice descriptions of the New Mexico countryside.	2003-03-19

Drake's fellow pilot, Mack, is in the wrong place at the wrong time and he is accused of the murder.  Drake asks Charlie to help with the investigation, since local law enforcement officers seem reluctant to look for any further suspects.  Charlie obliges and, as a result, her relationship with Drake begins to blossom.  She pursues the investigation with fervor (how many people would be willing to interrupt their Hawaiian vacation for a side-trip to California?) and eventually finds herself confronted by the killer.

Greed and the misuse of power are rampant throughout the story.  The main character is Clay Carter, a young attorney who works for the Office of the Public Defender in Washington.  He is discouraged by his low pay and lack of advancement, and is burned out because of the hopeless people that he defends.  His girlfriend, Rebecca, and her overbearing parents are growing weary of his seeming lack of initiative and they begin to feel that he is not a good marriage prospect.  When Clay rebuffs Rebecca's father's efforts to find him a higher-paying job, she decides to break off the relationship.  At about this time, Clay is tempted to become a litigator and he is presented with a golden opportunity to make a lot of money.  Clay goes for it, and begins a downward moral spiral where his disregard for his clients is only exceeded by his greed and pride.  Although the original premise of a drug which causes people to kill is a bit hokey, the story is one of Grisham's usual page-turners and should please those that enjoy his courtroom dramas.	2003-03-12

The story begins when Misha's father, Oliver, dies.  Oliver was a judge who had a failed attempt at the Supreme Court because of his association with an underworld figure who was a close friend.  Misha's sister is convinced that their father's death was all part of a conspiracy and she is determined to uncover the plot.  Misha receives a request to reveal his father's \\"arrangements\\" from his father's shady friend<BR>but Misha doesn't know what he's talking about.  In the ensuing chapters, Misha is stalked, attacked, and frightened in a variety of unpleasant ways.  He is confused as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys and why they all seem to be after him.  Meanwhile he has to tread a thin line with university politics, his wife's possible appointment to a judgship, his not-so-secure marriage, and several fractured relationships within his family.  Author Carter balances these <BR>plot lines with the finesse of a juggler and manages to keep the reader's attention through a long and complex book.  Carter could probably have trimmed off about 200 pages and still had a good story, but his main character's ruminations are erudite and illustrate the thought processes of a highly-educated, intelligent African-American man in today's society.	2003-03-11

She details the life of a large Hispanic family, who take an annual trip to Mexico to visit with the grandparents of the main character, Lala Reyes.  Cisneros follows the Reyes family back for three generations, and makes her characters understandable because of what they've been through.  The family lives in Chicago and San Antonio, and the details of their everyday life ring true.  Cisneros paints the lives of these characters, warts and all, and shows outsiders what it's like for a young girl to live in a family with no privacy, but with bonds that securely link these characters together.  There is a lot to be learned about the Hispanic culture between these pages, and the reader is left a lot wiser for having read this book.	2003-03-02

The timing seems right, as Anna has just been proposed to by Sheriff Paul Davidson in Mississippi and she needs some time and space to consider the offer.  She finds that entertainment is lacking on the small islands, so she's pleased when her sister sends letters that their great-great-aunt wrote while her husband was commander of Fort Jefferson on Garden Key.  The book alternates a chapter on Anna's investigation of suspicious activities at the park with letters from her great-aunt which describe her life during Civil War times when the fort was used as a prison.  The most notorious prisoners were two men who were thought to be conspirators in Lincoln's assassination, and were thus reviled by all those around them.  Although at times it's frustrating for the reader to be forcibly moved from one exciting plot to the other, the two stories are well-written and interestingly intertwined.  Anna, ever the intrepid heroine, goes through a series of death-defying scenarios, but emerges as a surprisingly vulnerable character.  Kudos to Nevada Barr for another enjoyable read!	2003-02-24

There is no proof of murder, but also there's no other evidence as to how she died.  Janice goes to Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone to find out what really happened to her daughter.  As Kinsey probes into Lorna's past, she finds out that she was involved in a lot of unsavory activities.  She also suffered from some health problems that might have contributed to her death.  Kinsey places all of Lorna's associates and friends on her list of suspects and her investigation takes her into some pretty seedy places and situations.  The reader remains as puzzled as Kinsey as to who the actual perpetrator is.  When the killer's identity is revealed there are a few interesting plot twists and Kinsey begins to wonder what true justice is.  Also all of the loose ends are not tied up neatly as in most of the Kinsey Millhone books, and some questions remain, even after the last page.

Sue Grafton can be relied on to provide a good read, and this book, although not the best in the series, is no exception.	2003-02-09

Detective Peter Decker and Orthodox Jewish Rina Lazarus have finally tied the knot in this book, but their honeymoon leaves a lot to be desired.  They are spending it in Brooklyn with Rina's in-laws.  Peter understandably feels uncomfortable in this situation and he is not yet accustomed to all of the Orthodox Jewish customs, despite his months of study.  Two plots wind through the book, namely the disappearance of one of his wife's troubled nephew and Peter's discovery of a person from his past.<BR>These subplots wind neatly around one another and, as usual the reader is treated to lots of interesting background about Orthodox Jewish custom.  Rina and Peter go through some difficult moments as she wants to help in the investigation and Peter does not want her put in danger.  All in all, this is a satisfying read and it makes me look forward to reading the rest of the series.	2003-02-07

This is the story of a small New England town where Jessica Warwick has returned to care for her mother, who is a stroke victim.  Jessica's mother, Lillian, was one the social leader in this small town, but a scandal involving Jessica's father has reduced Lillian to a bitter, complaining old woman.  Her snobbery intact, Lillian disapproves of her daughter dating Sam who is a local carpenter and handyman.  Years earlier, she had disapproved of her other daughter Emily's marriage to a man whom Lillian considered to be her social inferior.  Emily's husband died and she returned to Cape Light with an uncomfortable secret.  Jessica fights her own social prejudices and resisists Sam's efforts to build a closer relationship with him.  This book is similar to those of the Mitford series, but the authors do not have Jan Karon's ability to sketch characters and make them instantly likeable.  There are many loose ends left in the lives of the townspeople, obviously leaving the door wide open for a continuing series.  This is a pleasant read, but not a literary masterpiece.	2003-02-05

Meanwhile she is living on the opposite coast from Peter and this is making him very lonely.  As he is returning home from work one day, Peter discovers a wandering toddler who has no identification.  He takes her under his wing and makes it his mission to find her family.  Unfortunately when he does find them, they have been brutally murdered.  Rina comes to visit him while he is immersed in investigating these murders.  Their relationship deepens and then is threatened by the presence of one Peter's old army buddies who has been accused of rape and assault.  Kellerman eventually unravels all of these different sub-plots but only after uncovering some unsavory family secrets.  Parts of this book are overly graphic with descriptions of murder victims, and it is not as well-constructed as some of her other novels, but all in all, this is a good read.	2003-01-31

The call is made by the victim's friend, Rina Lazarus, whom Peter is attracted to immediately.  Thus begins a wonderful mystery series which features a strictly religious orthodox Jewish woman, and a man who is indifferent to religion, but not to Rina.  The tension between the two creates a wonderful dance of approach/avoidance and a question as to whether their beliefs or their feelings will reign supreme in their relationship.  Decker becomes acquainted with Rina's two sons and does his best to protect her from any future sexual attacks by the predator who roams the yeshiva community.  The rape occurred near the mikvah where the women go for spiritual purification.  Throughout the book the reader is treated to a background of orthodox Jewish practices and receives a real education in this fascinating religion.  The difficulties in the relationship between Rina and Peter are clearly defined, but the ending leaves room for further development in the other books of the series.	2003-01-27

She and her mother had left the island 10 years previously and her mother was now dead.  When she meets her father again, she can see that he has deteriorated physically and emotionally and he is just as uncommunicative as she remembers him to be.  People on the island seem frozen in time.  The same customs, feuds, and supersitions are all in place, as Mado remembers them.  The book is very difficult to get into and moves at a maddeningly slow pace, much like life on the island.  Things do pick up a bit towards the middle of the book, and at the end numerous secrets are revealed.  Several of the characters in the book are not who they seem to be, and the secrets in their lives have caused them to live in self-destructive ways.

They grew up in the same town, and at one time even lived in the same apartment complex in Houston, yet their paths never crossed until some friends introduced them at a barbeque when they were both over 30.  \\"Georgie\\" was the son of a wealthy, influential man and, although he loved and respected his father, he had a hard time forging his own identity.  Part of a large family, George was a naturally outgoing young man and the quintessential \\"party animal\\".  Laura was the only child of a well-respected builder and in her ladylike way she always tried to please her parents and do what was right.  They each experienced the tragic death of a loved one, and although deeply effected, they got through it to become stronger people in the long run.  When Laura came into George's life, her influence on him was immediate.  She is cited throughout the book as a person who has a calming influence on those around her and she was instrumental in slowing George down from his frenetic pace and endless quest for fulfillment.  Theirs has been a solid marriage, which is,in turn, the foundation for his attitude that his job is not everything because he also gains a lot of fulfillment from his family.  This is an interesting story and shows how George particularly has grown and matured over the years.  As he himself says, \\"Even a 'C' student can grow up to become President of the United States.\\"	2003-01-15

Abby quickly discerns that coming from &quot;off&quot; (anywhere other than Charleston) immediately puts a person down on the social scale.  However, when socialite Mrs. Amelia Shadbark invites her to tea, she feels that her social status is assured.  Mrs. Shadbark's invitation is more business than social, and she invites Abby to sell her priceless Lalique glass collection.  Abby is only too glad to oblige, but before she has the opportunity to start, Mrs. Shadbark is found dead.  Because she was the last person to see Mrs. S. alive, Abby becomes a prime suspect.  She does some of her own investigating, as is her custom, and discovers several suspects.  How she pins down the real murderer, while avoiding becoming the next victim, constitutes the rest of this amusing tale.  Myers has a new setting for her stories, but brings along most of Abby's pals, such as C.J. and the Rob-Bobs, whom we've grown fond of during the series.	2003-01-12

Realizing the difficulty of finding evidence in a case that old, Kinsey still persists in her investigation.  The small town where the murder occurred is just as inbred as most small towns and Kinsey hears gossip which tells her that Jean was a very promiscuous young lady.  She was also pregnant at the time of the murder, so that gave a motive to any of the various men she was involved with at the time of her death.  Kinsey keeps evolving throughout Sue Grafton's novels, both as a character and as an investigator.

In this latest Thomas and Charlotte Pitt tale, Thomas is about to leave on a 3 week holiday with his family.  He is summoned by Victor Narraway who tells him that he will not be able to make the trip because he must stay and try to foil the efforts of Charles Voisey, a Tory who is seeking a seat in Parliament.  Pitt has tangled with Voisey before and knows what a dangerous man he is and what evil he could do in a position of power.  He has no choice but to give up his trip and purue Voisey.  In the middle of his investigation, a death occurs which seems to be tied to some politicians and their wives who will be effected by the outcome of the election.  Pitt continues to investigate both the death and Voisey, while fearing for the safety of his family in the country.  Perry presents several people who have a motive for killing the dead victim and, in the end, ties the tale together neatly.  For those who have followed Perry's two series and for those who are new readers, this is a recommended book.	2002-12-22

This book fills in some of the blanks and tells how the girls went overseas in the first place and what their lives were like before they were captured by the Taliban.  They attempted to help the poor people in this Muslim country while letting the people know that they were Christians.  Since Taliban law   forbade people from attempting to convert Afghans to Chrisianity, they walked a fine line.  The majority of the book describes their imprisonment and the life they led while waiting to be rescued.  Although the details of their captivity are presented in a somewhat confusing fashion, the book is inspirational in that these two young women gave up the comforts of home, and risked their lives in order to do God's will.

In this latest installment, Judge Knott presides at a case where four young men have vandalized a game owned by Tallahassee Ames, who is part owner of a carnival which is playing in town.  Very shortly thereafter,Tallahassee's son is killed while Deborah is at the carnival.  As she does some investigating, Deborah discovers that she is related to Tally and to her son, Braz. She pursues the investigation while trying to develop a relationship with Tally, a sometimes tricky balancing act. Deborah's large extended family, consisting of 11 older brothers and their families, provides background and several interesting characters for this book.  Braz and his step-father had bought up the contents of several storage areas which had been auctioned off, so there were several angry people trying to get their property back who had a motive for killing Braz.  The book contains a lot of information about living in and running a carnival, and even contains a glossary of carnival terms.  It is nicely paced and even contains a little romance, which should combine to be very pleasing to both old and new Maron fans.	2002-12-14

As she delves into the investigation, she uncovers a prominent family's secrets and continues to get into trouble herself.  As usual, Kinsey's investigation causes physical danger to her, until she hunts down the perpetrator.  This is another good read from Sue Grafton.	2002-12-09

She does not disappoint in her latest novel, centered around the restaurant Quentins.  Her heroine is Ella Brady, a woman who has been the delight of her parents in her early years.  Later, however, they become concerned about her when she begins an affair with a married man.  He charms everyone around him, and Ella decides that a part-time relationship with him is better than none at all.  Later in the book, Ellas decides to make a documentary film which centers around Quentins and which will describe the changes in Irish society which have occurred over the years.  Several characters from Binchy's previous books, such as Tom and Cathy Feather, and Nora, reappear to delight faithful readers.  Short stories of Quentins' patrons are interspersed with the main story and each is a little Binchy masterpiece.  There is love, betrayal, suspense, and drama, and it all adds up to a pleasing package for readers.	2002-12-05

Kinsey Milhonne can't help but notice Bobby Callahan, the young man who works out at the same place she does.  Although only about 20-years-old, he shows the physical effects of a terrible car accident he has endured.  He is convinced that the accident was someone's attempt to kill him, and he feels that the person is still pursuing him.  He hires Kinsey to find out who that person is.  As she investigates, Kinsey finds out some surprising things about Bobby, but above all she feels admiration for a man who is battling to regain his memory and return to his normal physical state.  The investigation takes Kinsey through high society and wealthy people in the medical community where secrets begin to unfold to her.  This is the usual well-written Grafton mystery which has just enough twists and turns to make the ending interesting and satisfying to the reader.	2002-12-03

She is a hard-boiled private investigator in the mold of Marsha Muller's Sharon McCone. In this book she is approached by Nikki Fife who has just been released from 8 years in prison for the murder of her womanizing, ex-husband Laurance. Plenty of people had a motive for murdering him and Nikki plans to find out who really murdered Laurance. Kinsey works her way through a series of Laurence's business associates, past lovers, and their husbands as she seeks the murderer.

A confrontation with airline officials has resulted in his being banned from flying, so the train is the only way to go.  Tom is an adventuresome sort, but all of the travels and experiences from his days as a roving reporter have left him feeling empty, as if he's missed something in life.  He regrets a long-ago breakup with Eleanor, the love of his life, but--what's this?--she's actually aboard the train.  Baldacci spins a tale which includes train lore, eccentric characters, and danger to Tom and Eleanor, but somehow this book never grabbed me emotionally.  I felt like a stranger looking in at some strange situations, but the story never really touched me.  I have enjoyed other Baldacci books and I applaud him for trying another genre different than his usual thrillers, but I can only give him a &quot;C&quot; for his efforts.	2002-11-20

She also is dealing with her ex-husband, and trying to figure out her relationship with Joe, a local man who expresses interest in her,yet is reluctant to take her out in public.

Little does he know that Daniel intends for him to meet his daughter Serena, who is a blackjack dealer on the ship.  He does meet Serena and is instantly attracted to her, although he doesn't realize who she is.  These two independent people do a lot of sparring, and fight the growing feelings of attraction that they feel.  When Serena's life is put in danger, Justin realizes how much he cares for her.  The second story, entitled Tempting Fate involves Serena's brother, Caine, and Justin's sister, Diana.  Caine is a charming lawyer who is used to having his way with women.  Diana, also an attorney, is wary of relationships because of past hurts she has suffered.  Caine's father Daniel thinks that they would make a great match, but they are not convinced.  Roberts' books are predictable and the ones I've read seem to follow the same pattern, but they have a wide appeal for those who enjoy this genre.	2002-11-07

Both fiercely independent, they each wanted their own way in life more than they wanted each other.  Anna was a woman ahead of her time, studying to be a doctor against the wishes of her parents and the norms of society.  Daniel was a consummate businessman, who had begun to build a business empire which would only grow in the future.  Anna wanted a career and Daniel wanted her to be his non-working wife.  How they worked out their differences is the crux of this first story.  The second story tells of Daniel's ancestor, Ian, who had a history as a rebel in his native Scotland and who brought that rebellious spirit to America where he continued to fight the British.  The first story is longer and does a better job of developing the characters, while the second one is almost too short to tell the story properly.  For The MacGregor Family fans, however, this book fills in some information about the history of the family.	2002-10-30

All is well until they discover the dead body of one of their guests under a pile of presents on their bed.  Thus begins Susan's latest efforts at solving a murder mystery.  This book did not hold my interest as some of the others in the series have because there were so few suspects and not enough interesting red herrings.  Susan, her friend Kathleen, and her husband Jed seem to hash and rehash the same scenarios over and over before the murderer is revealed.  As in some of the earliest books in the series, the solution is pretty far-fetched and didn't provide a satisfying climax to the book.  This series has its ups and downs and this is one of the less sterling additions to the Susan Henshaw Mysteries.	2002-10-29

The breakfast meetings allow them to share their trials and problems and when things go bad for any of them, the others are there to lend their support.  As I read about situations which I had been through, I realized that Macomber's narration of these characters' feelings is right on target and the situations are realistically portrayed.  Reading this book encourages me to look for other books by this author.	2002-10-21

When Sharon begins to investigate, she finds that there are many irregularities in the company's finances, and the executives are treating their employees very poorly.  A close friend of Sharon's is killed and her investigation intensifies.  This is a typical well-written Sharon McCone mystery and it shows us even more facets of a character which has endured since the late 70's.

Add an eccentric psychic to the mix, and things become very complicated.

In spite of my negative vibes I proceeded with the book and enjoyed it thoroughly.  As always, Marcia Muller catches the essence of the California coast and she weaves a wonderful story into a beautiful background.  Deputy Rhoda Swift has never gotten over the multiple murders which occurred in her territory 13 years previously, and old memories are dredged up when another murder occurs near the anniversary of the deaths.  A writer named Guy Newberry comes to town with a plan to write about the murders,and he and Rhoda form a bond based on past hurts in their lives.

Sharon has always known that she is part Shoshone Indian and her investigation brings her face to face with her Native American relatives.  Greed, prejudice and corruption are all uncovered as Sharon seeks out her identity.  Her lover Hy is at her side, as always, but the McCones oppose her quest.  This book marks an interesting twist in the long-running Sharon McCone series, but watching Sharon try to solve her own mystery is not as intriguing as watching her solve other people's.

The heroine of the story is Laura, who was adopted by the plantation's overseer and his wife after Laura's birth parents died of cholera.  Laura is in an interesting social situation, not of the landed gentry, but also not a slave.  She relates to the slaves and the landowners but never really fits into either group.  She is attracted to the young son of the plantation owner and also the tutor who comes to Fairhope to teach the children there.  The book helps the reader sees what everyday life was like on a Texas plantation before and after the Civil War.

Soon it is established that Rochelle was poisoned and the likely suspect is her boyfriend, LaMar Jenkins.  Jenkins admits that Rochelle was trying to break up with him, so he has motive and plenty of opportunity.  Another disturbing finding is that Rochelle is not who she claimed to be.  There are connections with the state of Washington, and soon author Jance's first well-known character, J.P. Beaumont, shows up to help with the investigation.  Joanna resents the intrusion of an outside agency and is, to say the least, uncooperative with J.P.  In this reader's opinion, no book is big enough for these two larger-than-life characters.  One of them has to take a back seat and, in this case, it's J.P.  Joanna continues to treat him rudely until, inexplicably she has a change of heart and welcomes him into the investigation.  There is also a hint of romance towards the end of the book and this seems awkward and out of place.  Jance is an accomplished writer and this book is no exception, but the books seem to come across better when they are featuring either Joanna Brady OR J.P. Beaumont.	2002-09-27

The unlikely situations continue as her neighbor Amy pops in and out of her house at will and makes herself right at home.  Anyone who puts up with this much interference in her life, would be an unlikely candidate for unravelling a mystery!  Even though cozies are designed to be fun, the reader needs more realism than is shown in this book.  The strength of this series lies in the repeated characters and their interactions, not in the plots.	2002-09-23

Sharon McCone, female PI, begins to hear reports of someone who is impersonating her.  This person uses her credit cards, breaks into her house, has affairs while using Sharon's identity, and begins to seriously mess up Sharon's life and psyche.  At the same time, Sharon's secretary Ted is exhibiting strange and irrascible behavior.  Eventually it comes to light that he, too, is battling with a stalker.  Are these incidents related and is it the same person doing all of this mischief?  Sharon has to investigate these problems without the support of her lover, Hy Ripinsky, who is off on an assignment for his company.  The identities of the stalkers are revealed before the end of the book, but Muller still spins a good tale of Sharon's investigation and pursuit of them.  As usual, flying plays an important part in this book and there is a good mystery told.  This book will please Sharon McCone fans, old and new.	2002-09-20

She is still reeling over the divorce from her beloved Evan, and resents his new wife, Rebecca.  The holidays promise to be a difficult time for Kelly, especially with all the entertaining that goes on in this wealthy Connecticut neighborhood.  Things are complicated by the arrival of Susan's mother-in-law, her self-proclaimed nutritionist boyfriend, and Kathleen's mother.  These three are constantly harping on Susan and Kathleen about something, whether it's the non-healthy food they serve or the behavior of their families.  Rebecca and Evan give their usual elaborate Christmas party, but things are less-than-merry when Susan and Kelly discover Evan's dead body.  By the time the police arrive, the body has disappeared and Susan and Kathleen spend the rest of the book trying to discover who the murderer is.  This book is better written than the first two in the series, but the characters take a strange, blase attitude towards the fact that Evan has been killed.  Neither his wife nor his ex-wife seem too concerned about his death or the disappearance of his body.  Other than that, this is an enjoyable \\"cozy\\".	2002-09-16

If you've ever considered becoming a nanny, a quick look at this book might change your mind!  Two former nannies write a thinly-veiled fictional narrative of life as a nanny on Park Avenue.  The nanny in the book is a graduate student at NYU who needs a part-time job, but soon her employer, the heartless, self-centered Mrs. X, has Nan working all hours running errands, cooking, cleaning up messes,and generally enabling Mrs. X to get her nails done and do her &quot;charity work&quot;.  The sad part is that Nanny is very fond of Grayson, her 4-year-old charge, who is desperate for some quality time with his parents.  Whenever Grayson approaches his mother, she &quot;spatulas&quot; him off with protests of his messing up her hair or her perfect outfit.  Nanny herself is the product of a loving household and is truly appalled at the way that Grayson is shuttled off to French lessons, tennis lessons, swimming lessons, and whatever else Mrs. X can find to occupy him.  This book gives us a peek into a life which many envy, but which few would want to be part of if they knew what really goes on.	2002-09-13

The book continues with Chang, the Christian mole, dodging bullets at GC Headquarters, and Chloe, Hannah and Mac attempting to rescue George from Greece.  The Bowl Judgments begin to pour onto the Earth and it's evident that the Believers are immune, while the GC loyalists suffer greatly.  The style in this book is similar to the rest of the series, with scatter-shot views of events occurring in different places in the world.  The later books are certainly less compelling than the earlier ones, but I keep buying these books and reading them to see how it all turns out (although Revelation tells us that!)  Kudos to the authors who, while not the greatest of literary talents, have certainly focused people's attention on the Tribulation as no other modern writers have.	2002-09-09

Dr. Dean Ornish has done some revolutionary research on reversing heart disease by diet, exercise, and positive social interaction.  His diet is a life plan and is radically different from most American high-fat, high-calorie kind of eating.  He advocates a drastic reduction in fat (10% instead of the more common 40%) in food intake.  He explains that most diets are based on reduced portions which causes the dieter to feel hungry and want to go off the diet.  Under his plan, the amount of food is not so important as the kind of food that you eat.  He explains that all calories are not equal and that fat is the enemy of those who are concerned about heart disease.  A radical change is threatening to most people, but he addresses those issues and puts forth a very convincing argument for the advantages of his program.  Many of his recipes seem exotic and full of hard-to-find ingredients, but there are enough of them to satisfy the most particular palates, and readers can make their own modifications to produce more user-friendly recipes.  For those who scoff, the results which Dr. Ornish's patients have seen are hard to deny.	2002-09-05

At the beginning of the book, Holly is planning to marry lawyer Jackson Oxenhandler.  Violent and unexpected events occur, and suddenly Holly and her father Ham are pursuing a group of murdering bank robbers.  Ham infiltrates a left-wing group and walks a narrow line as a double agent.  He and Holly work in connection with an FBI agent, but they are never sure whom they can trust.  Woods has a lean writing style which is driven by dialogue and does not contain much description or detail.  If you enjoy this style, as I do, this is recommended reading.	2002-09-05

This book spans 50 years in the small town of Elmwood Springs, Misssouri, and follows such wonderful characters as Tot Whooten, Hamm Sparks, and the Oatman Family Gospel Singers.  The book is reminiscent of &quot;The Prairie Home Companion&quot; and Flagg spins her tales in a never-take-a-breath style which evokes equal shares of laughter and tears in her readers.  Her stories and characters are unforgettable and Flagg recounts a wonderful era during the 40's and 50's when neighbors were neighborly, people were honest, and patriotism was a quality to be admired.  This is a wonderful book, which will bring back warm memories to those of us who lived in that era, and will show those who didn't what they missed!	2002-09-04

We all wonder why godly people stumble (including ourselves.)  The author explains to us the seductive forces in the world today and shows how sincere Christians can fall into wrong thinking and acting.  She then details how we can arm ourselves, through prayer, Bible-reading, accountability groups, and other methods to resist the temptation all around us and keep our eyes on God.  She describes what repentance really is and shows us how to go about restoring our tarnished relationship with Christ.  This is inspiring and is a wonderful &quot;how-to&quot; book for any Christian.	2002-08-29

When Sharon begins to investigate, she finds that Ricky's marriage to her sister is in danger, as well as his life.  As she digs into Ricky's past, she discovers some sordid things he has done, and finds people who might have a motive to harm him.  This is a fast-paced mystery, full of interesting characters and enough twists and turns to keep things interesting.  There have been many changes in Sharon's life during the course of this series, and this book is full of them.  Marriages and partnerships are made and broken, and the reader gets a fascinating look at part of Sharon's family and at the backstage life of a music star.

Kathleen lets it slip that Susan's husband Jed is preparing for a surprise party for Susan's 40th. birthday.  Susan is already depressed by her approaching middle age and the fact that a woman named Dawn, who has had affairs with most of the men in the neighborhood, is back in town.  The party becomes really depressing when a dead body shows up and Susan and Jed become murder suspects.  There are no end of other people with motives, but the final conclusion is a weak one and the motive is pretty questionable.  There are some nice touches, such as Susan's son Chad becoming a hero because of his knowledge of cars, but basically the book falls a bit flat at the end.	2002-08-26

It is difficult to explain the plot without giving away too much information, but basically it deals with betrayal, good intentions and lack of discernment when choosing friends and spouses.  It is a wonderful book, full of unforgettable characters and sad thoughts of &quot;what might have been&quot;.  It tells of love which remains steadfast and love that flees in the face of temptation.  It is one of Maeve Binchy's best, which is high praise when the whole body of her work is considered.

The reader is privy to many more of McCone's inner thoughts than in the earlier books, and we come to know what makes her tick.  In this installment, Sharon is asked to pursue the so-called Diplobomber, who targets embassies of oil-rich nations.  The bomber has toyed with officials, giving a warning before he strikes, but still eluding their efforts to capture him.  During the course of her investigation, Sharon learns of the daily life inside the Azadi consulate which is dysfunctional, to say the least.  She continues her very open relationship with Hy Ripinsky, becomes very attached to a little girl who is a part of the investigation, and takes some impromptu flying lessons.  The action is often tense, and the conclusion is slowly but surely arrived at by McCone.  This is one of the best books of this series.	2002-08-20

Their children are growing older and more independent so these moms have more time to do some things they want to do.  The problem is that they are not sure that this project is such a good idea.  When they go to see the house, they are discouraged by the poor condition that it's in.  Also some strange things are happening on the job site which convince them that someone is sabatoging Bitsy's efforts.  Added to this, they are put off by the bossy and incompetant manner of the contractor, Sandy.  When a murder occurs, things become even more grim.  Jane and Shelley turn from decorators to investigators and finally, quite by accident, Jane solves the murder.  This is not Jill Churchill's best effort, but Jane Jeffry fans will probably want to read it.  The solution is presented very abruptly at the end, without much leading up to it.  Also there is not quite as much humor in this book as in some of the previous ones in the series.	2002-08-18

Her first case involves an old college chum whom she calls Suits.  Although he was an unpromising youth, Suits has become a man of some wealth and influence.  He specializes in taking over companies and turning them around so that they become profitable entities again.  In the process of doing so, Suits usually cuts unprofitable people and activities, thus earning him numerous enemies.  When someone starts to harass him in dangerous ways, Suits decides it's time to bring in an investigator to find out who's responsible.

One day the cheese is missing and that causes differing problems for the four creatures, depending on their personalities.  This book takes some heavy-duty themes and puts them in a light context.  In less than 100 pages the author brings up concepts such as values, entitlement, fear of failure, being proactive and the whole idea of leaving your comfort zone and venturing forth in new directions.

Instead of the reprimand which she expects, Sharon receives the offer of a promotion which would put her behind a desk and away from the action.  Although this goes against her grain, Sharon knows she must accept it if she wants to continue to work at All Souls'.  At the same time, she discovers that her lover, Hy, has disappeared while on a job for a company called RKI.  When she talks to Gage Renshaw at RKI, he tells her that he thinks Hy has double-crossed him and he wants to find him.  Sharon offers to do so, thereby getting paid for something she planned to do anyway, and also having a paying job which doesn't involve All Souls'.  She travels back and forth between California and Mexico in search of Hy and the answer to a series of unanswered questions.  Muller's books in this series become longer as time goes on, and this causes some extra action which becomes a bit distracting to the main plot.  However, she still spins a good tale and Sharon McCone remains a very likeable heroine.	2002-08-13

She then proceeds to the Biblical accounts in Acts which describe his conversion, and subsequent ministry.  She then proceeds to the letters Paul wrote to his disciples, such as Timothy.

His survival guilt drives him to discover who is behind the massacre and why he froze up and thus did not enter the area where the killing occurred.  He is helped by Clair Daniels, a beautiful divorcee who also happens to be a psychiatrist.  The plot has a satisfying number of twists and turns and is complex enough to take several chapters to unfold at the end.  This book has both an interesting plot and a complex hero which makes for a very good read.	2002-07-31

In this second book of the series, author Chiaverini takes us deeper into the lives of the Elm Creek Quilters.  We read about a mother and daughter who don't get along, a woman whose father deserted her mother before she was born, a mother having trouble with her teenage son, a quilter whose husband is considering adultery, and others.  Quilters will probably enjoy this book on several levels, but even a non-quilter such as myself can appreciate reading about the talents of others and will enjoy the friendship and support that the women in this book give to one another.	2002-07-24

She pursues several dead ends before she finally figures out who is responsible for the murder and the other mischief.

She creates brochures with clues to different mysteries to advertise the event and to entice readers to enter the contest to discover which books are referred to by the clues.  Meanwhile someone else distributes bogus flyers which refer to unsolved mysteries which have occurred on the island in the past.  Things become even more complicated when murders begin to occur.  Annie and Max try to solve the murders and determine who has distributed the muckraking flyers.  It is somewhat distracting as a reader to have 5 mysteries hanging in the air along with the murders.  The solution at the end seems quite abrupt and incomplete as there is never a good explanation as to who distributed the flyers and why they were ever created in the first place.  This is not typical of author Hart, which causes this book to be one of the lesser lights of the series.	2002-07-17

This book has a deliciously convoluted plot and a mystery which Muller and Pronzini develop to a crescendo and then reveal to the reader bit by bit.

Although not sure of her beliefs, Cile attempts to be a good wife and to serve her husband and the church.  When she comes across her old high school boyfriend Andy, they begin an affair and eventually plan to divorce their respective spouses and marry one another.  In some ways, the announcement is ridiculously (and somewhat unrealistically) easy.  None of their four kids seems to have a problem with their parents' marriages breaking up and the congregation waves Cile a world-weary goodbye without any of the recriminations which one might expect.  In other ways, the breakup seems to cause problems as far as Andy's farmland and Cile's independence is concerned.  The book has a lot of flashbacks which are sometimes hard to distinguish from the current action.  The book is saved by the wry commentaries on life in small-town Texas and on the greed which seems to be at the center of so many events of the 90's.	2002-06-07

This is the first installment of her Sharon McCone Mystery Series which had a strong influence on later female authors and heroines.  Sue Grafton, in a quote on the book jacket calls Muller the \\"founding mother of the contemporary female hard-boiled private eye\\".  That's quite a claim considering how many well-known female investigators there are in fiction now.  In this first installment, Sharon McCone is the investigator for a group of attorneys called All Souls Cooperative.  Her boss Hank asks her to investigate the murder of an antique store owner who has been stabbed with one of her own knives.  Sharon learns that the dead woman was about to make an important decision about selling her property and she feels that this might be a motive.  She also discovers some shady goings-on among the art dealers and tries to fit this in to a motive for murder.  Add to this some past and present romances, and there are several possible suspects.  Muller's writing is clear and to-the-point.  She tells a good story and carefully wraps up each loose end.  I look forward to reading the other books in this series, which has so far spanned a 25-year period.	2002-06-05

That all rings true, but what happens next does not.  A murder is committed and a likely suspect disappears and suddenly the inhabitants of the island are enticed into a city of tents, divided up into men's and women's quarters from which they are to launch a search for a missing woman.  It is difficult to imagine that such a thing would happen (why can't they search during the day and stay in their own homes at night?) and even more difficult to believe that a newly-married couple would fall for such a scheme.  Max's mother Laurel provides some comic relief in the book, but her occult-loving friend Ophelia is a just a bit over the top.  Let's come back down to earth, Mrs. Hart, and return to the formula which made you successful, the Agatha Christie-like mystery solved by the deductive reasoning of the heroine.  Annie's solution to the case comes as almost a minor event compared to the other things which are going on in the book.	2002-06-04

He compares Satan to a plantation owner who knows that legally his slaves have been freed but who tries to convince them that they'll never make it in this world without him.  He says that sometimes we need to make it to rock bottom before we realize that &quot;Christ IS the Rock at the bottom.&quot;  He details the great power we have in Christ if we will but turn our lives over to Him and allow Him to work through us so that we can be all that God intended us to be.  He discusses strongholds which all of us have and how to overcome those strongholds with the power of Christ.  This is a very inspiring and encouraging book, both for those who have not confessed Christ and for those who have been Christians for many years.	2002-06-04

It is the story of Elizabeth White, a shy young 10-year-old English girl, who is sent to her mother's school chum in Ireland in order to keep her from the dangers of World War II.  The Irish O'Connors are the direct opposite of the English Whites.  Whereas Elizabeth is an only child, her chum and counterpart Aisling shares the house with a rollicking set of brothers and sisters.  Elizabeth's parents are formal and strangely aloof, while Aisling's are loud, demonstrative and loving.  At the end of the war, Elizabeth returns to her cold parents, but she keeps up a correspondance with Aisling.  As they grow up, the young women endure unhappy love affairs, illness in their families, and unfulfilled dreams, yet they are always free to confide in and support one another.  Binchy describes life in a rollicking Irish family with loving detail and creates characters which the reader grows to love.  The other side to that is the Irish melancholy which is also an important part of her writing, so the reader needs to be prepared for both.	2002-05-30

Jessie is distressed by the destruction of her cabin by fire, as described in the previous book, Beneath the Ashes.  While waiting for her cabin to be rebuilt, Jessie is living in a tent which lacks many of the comforts of home.  Fortunately a friend has purchased a Winnebago and needs someone to drive it to Alaska for him.  Jessie agrees to do so and she departs on what she thinks will be an adventure and a good sight-seeing trip.  She meets Maxie, a compatible older woman and they strike up a friendship as they travel north through several RV parks.  At the same time, Jessie meets Patrick, a young man with a troubled past who is very secretive about his life yet who appeals to the two women for help.  They agree to bring him along with them, but trouble seems to follow them, and they begin to debate the wisdom of taking Patrick under their wing.  As usual, this book contains wonderful descriptions of the breath-taking Alaskan and Canadian scenery and some pretty suspenseful chase scenes.	2002-05-16

The local police suspect it is Annie herself but with her friend Max Darling, she sets out to find the real murderer. Max and Annie discover that each of the Regulars has avoided a brush with the law and each has something to hide which Elliot could have known about. There are lots of wonderful references to classic mysteries and mystery writers as Annie and Max work to solve the case. This is the first book of a justly popular series.	2002-05-16

At the same time, Jessie receives a call from a former neighbor, Anne Holman, who asks to come and stay with her for awhile.  Anne is very insistant and after arriving, she asks to be taken to her old cabin.  She also tells Jessie that her husband has been abusive to her for years, something that Jessie never suspected of her former neighbor.  Eventually the husband arrives in town in search of his wife, and he tells a story that is exactly the opposite of Anne's.  Jessie is confused and can't decide which of the couple is telling the truth.  There are more deaths and more fires before Jessie unravels the truth.  The explanation for the motivation for setting the fires is not very believable and there are several things which don't make sense, such as why Anne's husband would help her in certain ways.  Also, Alex Jensen provided a love interest and some interesting tension in previous books in the series, and they are not the same without him.  Even though Henry gives some interesting information about the training of racing dogs, her best books are those which actually occur during a race.	2002-05-13

She also describes well the feelings of the characters who are put in dangerous situations.  Henry deals with Jessie's ambivalent feelings about her relationship with Alex Jensen in this book.

Alex decides that Jessie needs to go to a remote island where she can be safe and he can find the culprit.  There is a lot of suspense in this book, and the usual wonderful descriptions, but there are some flaws which are not evident in Henry's other books.  The reason for the harrassment is hard to believe and is too convoluted to ring true.  Also, author Henry seems to be changing her mind as to who is the main character in her books.  The earlier books in the series are labelled at the Alex Jensen Mystery Series, but now that Jessie is emerging as the main character, they are called the Alaska Mysteries.  There also seems to be a lot of ambivalence on Jessie's part as to what is more important--her relationship with Alex or her independence.  If you can swallow the improbable ending, the book is still a good read.	2002-05-09

Soon there is a murder and a theft to add to the intrigue.  Henrie O does some behind-the-scenes investigating in order to piece the puzzle together.  The setting of the River Walk is a brilliant one and Hart's descriptions of San Antonio are vibrant and very accurate.  There are a few unlikely scenarios, such as a thief letting Henrie O take a very valuable valise full of goods, and the way Henrie O decides to trap the murderer in the end, but this still remains a good read for Hart fans.	2002-05-03

Magdalena discovers that there were 4 people who visited Clarence in jail and she deduces that one of them must have put the deadly arsenic into his dinner.  She races around the countryside in her newly-purchase sedate Buick (which replaces the red BMW she has just sold to Clarence) and interviews the suspects while searching for clues.  As in each of the preceding books of the series, the reader is informed that the Amish and Mennonite bloodlines are so mixed that Magdalena is her own cousin.

Doing so involves trips to Texas and Kauai where she confronts Richard's friend Belle whom he was visiting at the time of his death.  Henrie O had always been afraid that Richard's involvement with Belle was more than platonic and she vows to find out the truth behind their relationship, as well as the identity of the person who murdered Richard.  There are no end of suspects on the island, all of them Belle's family or employees, and Henrie O has her work cut out for her trying to discern which one killed Richard.  As always, author Hart crafts a well-written book and this one has an added emotional intensity because of Henrie O's love for her late husband.

Canoeist Jim Hampton is on a trip down the Yukon River when he discovers the bones and the journal of a prospecter, Addison Riser from the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897.  While pondering the question of what may have caused Riser's death, Hampton is attacked and left for dead himself.  He escapes and is discovered by Detective Alex Jensen and Inspector Charles Delafosse who are investigating a stolen car ring and the murder of a prominent man.  There is evidence to suggest that Hampton committed the murder and the two lawmen investigate that possibility.  The story continues with the constant weaving of Riser's story from the 1800's with that of modern-day Hampton.  The story includes lost treasure and a further murder.  Henry makes the story rich and complex, yet manages to convincingly tie up all of the loose ends at the end.  The reader is also treated to the rich background of the Yukon and a history lesson about the Gold Rush.	2002-04-09

Unfortunately her friend becomes ill and is not able to go, but she urges Henrie O to go anyway.  When she arrives at the cabin, she encounters her friend's nephew who is in shock and is covered with his wife's blood.  He has discovered her dead body and has run away in a panic, thus squarely pointing the finger of suspicion at himself.  Henrie O believes that the young man did commit the murder and she sets out to find out who did.  The cabin is near the upper middle class town of Fair Haven, and Henrie O finds a lot of people who envied the dead woman and who stood to gain financially from her death.  After the usual red herrings, Henrie O finally uncovers the surprising truth.  Carolyn Hart's books are always engrossing and well-written and I would recommend them to mystery fans.	2002-04-07

Wealthy, arrogant Chase Prescott invites his long-ago colleague Henrietta O'Dwyer Collins to come to his private island to try to determine who is trying to murder him.  He tells her that an attempt has been made on his life and that he is determined to find the culprit.  He invites anyone whom he feels had the motive and opportunity to Dead Man's Island (renamed Prescott Island by the egotistic Chase.)  Henry O accepts his invitation and joins the others for a few days on the isolated, mysterious island off the coast of South Carolina.  The problem she encounters is that everyone present does have a motive and that makes it difficult for her to find the culprit.  The action becomes more exciting towards the end when a powerful hurricane threatens the island and murders begin to occur.  The solution to the murder is a convoluted one which defies logic and which makes me wonder why Chase invited Henry O in the first place.  The book is very readable, however, and gives the reader many pages of real suspense.	2002-04-04

They chat amiably and harbor unspoken feelings about one another, but none of them really knows the others.  Each of the passengers, and Tom himself, have secret lives which they wish to keep hidden from the others.  In this book, Maeve Binchy uncovers all of these secrets and leaves us to ponder how little we really do know about those we see and chat with on a regular basis.  Some of the secrets are noble, but some are not and there is a poignancy about each one.  Following the &quot;Lilac Bus&quot; are four unrelated stories where Binchy weaves her magic with quickly sketched characters and plot.  Some end a bit abruptly and leave the reader wanting more, but Binchy fans will probably want to include this in their reading.	2002-04-02

The book details the progress of the race and the unusual &quot;accidents&quot; which take place along the way.  State trooper Alex Jensen is highly suspicious that some of the mushers may be sabatoging others in an effort to gain an advantage in the race.  Henry creates vivid descriptions of the race course and the brutal conditions which beset those brave enough to participate in the Iditarod.  She creates enough red herrings to make the mystery interesting and vividly writes about the dangers, both natural and man-made, which the racers encounter.  I  highly recommend this book!	2002-03-30

In this book, she does it 22 times and manages to make each story contain a universal truth or moral.  The main characters either remain blissfully unaware of the truth they are illustrating or have an \\"ah hah!\\" moment by the end of the story.  The frustrating part of the short story genre is that readers would often like to hear more about the characters and see the plots more fully developed.  Her novels, which knit together disparate characters into a pleasing whole, are more appealing to this reader, but if you enjoy Binchy, this is still worth a read.	2002-03-29

She decides that different perspectives are needed on this difficult case, so one by one she invites women with different kinds of expertise to join her in the investigation. Clues begin to fall into place until the killer is revealed to the women. This is an interesting book with enough intrigue to keep the reader guessing, and reading. My only objections are that so many things in the plot seem contrived and Patterson uses a few too many twists to keep things believable. Nevertheless, it's a good read.	2002-03-23

With this rather weak premise, Quill packs up his cats and heads off for a mini-vacation.  He soon figures out what is causing the problem, but his conclusion doesn't make much sense to this reader.  He also discovers a dead body, but after reporting it to the police, he almost seems to forget about it and to become involved in other activities in the community.  He does several interviews for a new book he's writing, attends dramatic presentations and gets to know the other guests at the Inn.  He also carries on a correspondence with his friend Polly, who is taking a trip with her sister.  In her postcards, she keeps mentioning a man she has met, but that little subplot also goes nowhere.  Finally, the killer's identity is revealed, but it is handled as if it is an insignificant event.  There are lots of subplots which are never fully developed and the reader is left with a rather incomplete feeling at the end.  These books will probably be read by Braun's die-hard fans, who can only keep hoping that the books will return to their previous charm and polish.	2002-03-03

Emma is uncertain as to what to do, but her sidekick Vida convinces her that she must help Ronnie, since he is a family member.  Emma decides to go to Seattle to help Ronnie and Vida invites herself along.  When they arrive they discover that the life of the dead girl, Carol, was quite a tangled web.  Emma and Vida begin their own investigation, since they find the police in Seattle to be just as inept as they are in Alpine.  There are a number of people connected to Carol who seem to be good suspects but the intrepid investigators from Alpine keep coming up empty-handed.  Nothing seems to make sense in this case, especially when another murder takes place.  Emma stumbles upon one of the murderers and then realizes who the other one is.

They are helped by their daughter Anna, who is just getting over an unhappy love affair.  Less helpful are their other two children, Helen, a hopeless bungler who is hoping to be taken on as a nun, and Brendan, who has escaped his childhood home and family to take up farming with his Uncle Vincent in Ireland.  Other guests include the best man Frank, who has become much more successful than Desmond and the maid of honor, Helen, both of whom have their own problems.  Deirdre is extremely concerned with appearances, since she married &quot;beneath her&quot; 25 years ago, and her gentle falsehoods and nervous posturings effect her children and others around her.  Each of the eight main characters is introduced in a chapter and they all come together for the celebration at the end.  This book does not have the depth of other Binchey novels, nor the redemption of all of its characters, but it is an interesting read, nonetheless.	2002-02-04

He is intimately involved in their lives, yet refuses to let them become involved in his.  He is a man of mystery and as such is the center of much speculation by those who know him.  When his life ends tragically in an accident, his friends are saddened and horrified.  What they don't realize is that his death will be a catalyst to their own rebirth and rediscovery of themselves.  As they probe into Adam's past and attempt to discover who he really was, they find out things about themselves that they never knew.  Joyce Carol Oates has offered this interesting premise to the reader and has couched it in sensitive prose which probes the depths of her characters.  She has taken a group of wealthy people, by nature unsympathetic to readers because of their self-centered, materialistic and empty lives, and turned them into happy and fulfilled individuals who discover new truths about themselves as a result of their friend's death.  This is a wonderful book!	2002-02-02

The chapters rotate among three separate stories.  Her first character works for the Park Service in an effort to restore an area to its pristine wildness with each species being given the opportunity to flourish without the interference of man.  She is particularly interested in the coyote and carefully guards the den of a coyote family who have returned to an area they left long ago.  The second story concerns a man who is trying to develop a perfect chestnut tree and his neighbor who abhors any kind of chemical being sprayed for the purpose of killing weeds or insects.  The third story is about a well-educated city woman who is an expert on moths and who marries a farmer with a possessive and suspicious family that leaves her feeling like an outsider.  Eventually the three stories are woven artfully together and the characters intersect.  Kingsolver's wonderful writing is as evident in this book as in her others, but her environmentalist's agenda comes on a bit strongly in this one.	2002-01-14

It must have been the most difficult one to write, as it is the story of Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Her story is so well-known and oft-repeated that even the most casual Bible reader is familiar with it.  As usual Rivers fleshes out the Biblical accounts with more emotional and everyday incidents.  In this case she reached a bit further and wrote some incidents which were never recorded in the Bible but which could have happened within the context of Jesus' character.  She emphasizes the maternal feelings which Mary had for Jesus, and her sadness at &quot;losing&quot; him to his ministry.  This book does not succeed as well as the others in the series, but is a noble effort and does give the reader some food for thought about what might have been.	2002-01-08

This is a laugh-out-loud book with situations that are hilarious and bizarre.  In this latest entry, Stephanie is in search of Eddie DeChooch, an old man who has been caught selling stolen cigarettes.  Eddie can't see or hear and there are a few other things he can't do, but he is excellent at eluding Stephanie, her sidekick Lula, and her bounty-hunting friend Ranger.  Apprehending him becomes even more of a priority when a dead body shows up in his shed.  After that the plot takes a few sharp curves, including the disappearance of Stephanie's Grandma Mazur (a pretty feisty lady in her own right) and two of Stephanie's acquaintances, Mooner and Dougie.  Throw in some mud wrestling and a pig heart, and you have some idea what you're up against in this book.  Evanovich just keeps rolling along and her fans keep rolling in the aisles.	2002-01-08

She has mixed feelings about this as she knows that Ranger is much better at hide-and-seek than she is and she also has a somewhat personal interest in him.  Since Ranger is wanted by the police, bounty hunters, and the mob, Stephanie keeps running into one or the other of these people who think that Plum is hot on his trail.  In the middle of this Stephanie suddenly has two roommates--Bob, the dog, who is dumped on her by a &quot;friend&quot;, and Grandma Mazur who is mad at her son-in-law.  They add to the complications of her life and put a real crimp in any romantic designs she has on Ranger or Joe Morrelli, her cop friend.

She grows up and unwillingly becomes the wife of Uriah, still clinging to her love for David.  The Biblical events of her affair with David are narrated, along with the guilt they feel from betraying Uriah.  Even after Bathsheba and David are married, their troubles do not end.  Family intrigue becomes a way of life and a tragic death mars their marriage.

Hopefully future books will pick up the pace a bit.  Certainly the next book in the series has been set up with the action in this one.  Carpathia has become more demanding and demented and after desecrating the temple, he demands that all believers take the mark of the beast.  That makes life a bit more difficult for the Christians who have evaded his annihilations so far.  The believers are gathered and transported to Petra, where they are promised safety by the Tribulation Force.  There are more martyrs in this book, and the climatic scene sets up a confrontation between the believers and the Global Community.

They work together trying to find out who is at the bottom of all of this.  I wondered how the two authors would work together on this joint effort and they used the format of each one writing every other chapter, which features his hero.  This is a pleasant book and an enjoyable read but, disappointingly the murderer was too easy to spot.

In desperation, she begins working for Ranger, a more experienced bounty hunter who moonlights by participating in some suspicious activities.  He keeps presenting Stephanie with cars, and she keeps destroying them.  Her new and closer relationship with Ranger has sometime cop boyfriend Joe Morelli a bit concerned.  A clever ending keeps the reader wondering which of these two men Stephanie has chosen.  As usual the book is full of hilarious characters, including Grandma Mazur, who has a penchant for attending funerals, and Lula, a former prostitute who is Stephanie's bounty-hunter-in-training.

Emma then joins them in their search for answers as to who the skeleton was and how it got in their basement.  Many of the premises of this book seemed very contrived to me.  Supposedly Emma barely knew her hostess and yet she imposed on her for several days.  Also I wondered why the threesome would go to such great lengths to uncover the identity of the skeleton.  Also, all of their theories were pretty much only theories, since they could prove none of them.<BR>Of course our intrepid heroine comes up with the solution almost by accident.

Emma and her friends uncover some things about Marilynn's background which connect her to the victims, but Emma is convinced that she did not commit the murders.  After a few red herrings, Emma finally discovers the truth.  This is an enjoyable read, but it was difficult for me to believe that there would be this much discrimination in the 90's and a few loose ends were left at the end, such as who was sending Marilynn the hate mail.

There are the requisite number of red herrings, although Brown gave a clue towards the end which enabled me to guess the murderer.  My only objection to these books is the conversations between Harry's pets, done in italics, which tend to be distracting.  Overall this is an entertaining book.	2001-11-25

Her characters in this book, as always, are sad and their glasses are half-empty instead of half-full.  Happiness eludes Codi, the main character but is close at hand if she will only reach out and grasp it.  She is an aimless soul who quit medical school shortly before finishing and ended up back home where she checks on her ailing father, the town physician.  Her relationship with him has always been uneasy, as her mother's death deprived her of important aspects of being parented, and her father was unable to fill the gap.  Her beloved sister Hallie is in Nicaragua trying to save crops and thus people, and somehow Codi feels useless by comparison.  Added to this, her parents came from Illinois to this remote spot in Arizona, and the family were always outsiders.  This is a beautiful story of Codi's redemption and growing maturity.  I highly recommend it!	2001-11-17

Jordy Poteet's newly-discovered father, Bob Don Goertz, invites him to a family reunion on an island off the Texas coast.  Jordy does not want to acknowledge Bob Don, let alone the rest of his extended family.  However, his girlfriend Candace convinces him that he owes his father the respect of going and that he needs to get to know his biological family.  Jordy goes grudgingly, and begins to think he made a mistake, when his new family begins to argue and snipe at one another and at him.  One of his relatives shows up dead under suspicious circumstances and Jordy notices how eager some of them are to blame it on natural causes or suicide.  As time passes, Jordy begins to learn family secrets which have been kept quiet for years.  He feels certain that one of the family is the murderer, but the family lies and deceptions seem to have created a number of people who had motive and opportunity.  This is the most powerful book yet, in the wonderful Jordan Poteet Series.  Abbott paints wonderful word pictures and creates totally believable, if malevolent, characters.  This book is highly recommended!	2001-11-14

Jordy Poteet, inveterate librarian in the mythical small town of Mirabeau, Texas, returns to solve yet another murder.  The book begins with some mysterious explosions, one of which injures Jordy's arm.  Shortly after his injury, Jordan is surprised with the appearance of Lorna who was his girlfriend when he lived in Boston.  She is presumably in town with a corporation which is attempting to buy some land for an upscale housing development.  She is accompanied by her boss who is unceremoniously killed with a length of barbed-wire.  Complications arise when environmentalists oppose the development and Lorna tries to seduce her old boyfriend.  Jordy is caught in the middle, between Lorna and new girlfriend Candace, and frankly begins to enjoy all the attention.  Things get serious when there's another murder and Jordy works to sort things out.  There are a sufficient number of &quot;red herrings&quot; to make this an enjoyable mystery and one which is not easy to figure out.  As usual, Abbott creates the perfect Texas small-town background for his well-written book.	2001-11-05

Grisham evokes a time from his past, growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm.  Although not specifically autobiographical, this book could only be written by someone who knows what it is like to pick cotton in the burning summer sun until his fingers bleed and his back aches.  The narrator is a seven-year-old boy who, though somewhat sheltered on his parents' farm, sees life and death in a stark, realistic way.  He seems to be everyone's confidante and he carries around secrets which are too much for a 7-year-old.  He also relates the closeness of family, the teamwork necessary to keep the farm running and the kindness which his family shows to those less fortunate than themselves.  Put away your thoughts of courtrooms and lawyers, and come enjoy the craft of a gifted writer.	2001-10-29

Before this book was published, the majority of studies on the subject of near-death experiences had dealt with adults.  This book specifically concentrates on NDEs of children.  Dr. Morse theorized that children would be less influenced by their culture and environment, so their reactions would be more &quot;pure&quot; than their adult counterparts.  There are many similarities between the experiences of children and adults and only one major difference, as Dr. Morse points out.  He includes many interviews with children and even includes two patients who had NDEs as children and again as adults.  For the scientific-minded among readers, there are plenty of studies included which show that it is unlikely that any of the experiences recorded in this book had anything to do with delusions caused by drugs or by physical or mental illness.  These experiences seem to have caused great comfort to those they happened to, and thus to the reader.	2001-10-01

To celebrate this august occasion, members of Virgil and Mary Alice's family attend a benefit to help raise money for the refurbishment of Vulcan, the majestic statue which has mooned--er--loomed over Birmingham for many years. Part of the entertainment is a chorus line of 30 Elvis impersonators, some of them Virgil's relatives. One of them is killed during the performance and falls into the orchestra pit. The spotlight of suspicion falls on the Elvises, Virgil's family and even Patricia Anne herself. The Sisters do a little undercover work but are baffled when they discover that their leads are false ones. Finally, in a climactic scene the murderer is uncovered and the Sisters narrowly avoid being victims themselves. Anne George has written a delightful series which is always warm and humorous. Her fans mourn her passing and will certainly miss their annual adventure with Mouse and Sister. Fortunately we have eight wonderful Sister books to read and cherish and to remember her by. (Please forgive the preposition at the end, Mouse.)	2001-08-29

As isolated at the retreat is, it gives Sister Joan a bit more freedom and introduces her to a wild area of Scotland with some interesting townspeople. There is a decided anti-Catholic sentiment in the nearby village, but two families overcome their prejudice enough to invite Sister Joan for a meal. She discovers that there has been an unhappy history between the two families and they are currently estranged because of past romances. She spends some of her leisure time painting pictures of a monastery which is on an island which can only be reached by a rowboat, obligingly rowed for her by a young monk named Cuthbert. Of course the inevitable body shows up and Sister Joan is torn between her obligation to the monks and her responsiblity to report it to the police. As usual, she would rather solve the case herself than to turn it over to the local authorities. This is a good addition to the series and the loose ends are all cleverly tied up in the end.	2001-08-27

Born in 1898, he tells of what life was like in Texas before integration.  He turned away racial hatred by his gentle manner and kept his dignity during the most trying circumstances.  He did manual labor from the time he was 4 until he was 90, and at age 98 he began to look for new challenges and so decided to go to Adult Education classes and learn to read.  When he was growing up, he was always working,and as the oldest son he was depended upon to contribute financially to his family.  His younger brothers and sisters went to school, but he never had a chance until someone knocked on his door and offered him the chance to learn to read. His quiet dignity shines through the pages as his story is told to co-author, Richard Glaubman.  Glaubman is an elementary school teacher from Washington who became fascinated with a newspaper article he read about Dawson in a Seattle paper.  The two became good friends over the course of the writing of this book and it is told in a narrative style of two friends chatting about the past.  Some of the most interesting stories involve Dawson's early years and the times in his 20's when he traveled around the country just to satisfy his wanderlust.

In this novel, Binchy details the lives of a group of young people in the town of Castlebay, Ireland, from 1950-1962.  There are the usual class distinctions which are far more important to the adults than they are to their children.  One young woman, Clare O'Brien, renounces the usual life of her working class parents by working hard enough to get scholarships to school.  She studies under the tutelage of Angela O'Hara who was also academically gifted, but whom circumstances have trapped in a dead-end teaching job in her hometown.  Clare works hard for her degree, thus separating herself from her family.  However, her academic successes have not put her on an even level with some of the young people who come from more prominent families.  She and a wealthier young man fall in love and they must battle a variety of negative outside influences.  This is an engrossing tale which causes the reader to really care about the characters and what becomes of them.	2001-08-21

The Quilliam sisters are in the process of buying back their beloved Inn at Hemlock Falls which they had sold to a local businesswoman, Marge Schmidt.  They are being helped (inexplicably) by a wealthy Finn named Horvath who has fallen in love with American fast food.  He wants it served at the Inn, but of course this offends Meg Quilliam who is renowned for her gourmet fare.  At this point a group of writers from a cartoon show decides (again, inexplicably) that they will have a working vacation at the Inn so that they can revamp their show.  Somehow they decide to make it a satire on all things Finnish, which offends Horvath and endangers his business deal with the Quilliams.  Dead bodies predictably begin to appear and the Quilliams do their usual sleuthing.  The plot is tied together in a rather fast and loose fashion at the end and the Quilliams are left with the usual questions about their love life?  Does Quill love Myles or John?  Or neither?  Will Meg marry Andy and move to New York or commute or not marry or...... you get the idea!	2001-08-05

His overbearing attitude aggravates Sarah Quilliam who runs the Inn, and her sister Meg, who is the chef.  At the same time, the former members of the Hemlock Chamber of Commerce have split and formed two new groups which are organized by gender.  The men take mysterious trips into the woods to play on drums and find their true nature while the women are beginning to have real feminist leanings.  An inquisitive tv reporter named Nora Cahill comes to cover the proceedings.  During the course of the book several murders occur and Sarah becomes a chief suspect.  One of the delightful fringe benefits of reading Claudia Bishop is her extensive vocabulary which sends me scurrying to my dictionary a time or two during the reading of a book.  The word this time was &quot;tatterdemalion&quot;.  I am looking forward to reading more of this author's work.	2001-07-24

Magdelena is called upon to be a temporary deputy in order to help Melvin solve the murder of an Asian visitor who has been strangled and then run over by an Amish buggy.  Magdelena has her usual group of interesting guests at the PennDutch Inn and they are suspects along with some local teenage boys who love to drive their buggies around town late at night.  She is unwittingly aided by her father-in-law who is in search of aliens and flying saucers and who helps her uncover some important evidence.  This one is a bit thin as to the plot, and the murderer's motive is pretty shaky, but it's still good fun if you're a &quot;cozy&quot; fan.	2001-06-25

Rahab stands as one of the most courageous and faithful women of the Bible. Despite being a Caananite and a prostitute, she recognizes the truth and power of God of the Israelites.  She realizes that the Jews are indeed his chosen people and that they had been promised her land by God.  When two spies are sent to Canaan, she welcomes them and helps them.  In return, they promise to spare her and her family when they invade her country.  Rahab persuades her family to seek refuge in her house and they watch in amazement as the Jordan River parts and the Israelites return to the land of their fathers.  Even more amazing is the 7-day march around Jericho and the eventual fall of the walls.  Again, Rivers brings a Bible story to life and makes it more memorable to the reader, while making every effort to stay true to the Biblical account.	2001-06-19

They quarrel, and Adam leaves for a business meeting aboard his boat.  When there is an explosion on the boat, with everyone presumed dead, Nell is wracked with guilt.  She is torn between her dead husband's wishes and her grandfather's insistence that she participate in the campaign.  Her grandfather raised her after the untimely death of her parents, so she feels she owes him a lot.  Nell and her Aunt Gert both possess some psychic abilities, so she is not totally surprised when her Aunt Gert's friend, Bonnie, says that Adam has contacted her and wants to communicate with Nell.  Added to this, it seems that Adam may have been participating in illegal activities connected with his architecture business.  These disparate plot threads are never completely woven into a satisfying whole and this is not Clark's best book, but it is basically a good read.	2001-06-18

She shows the faith and perserverance of Tamar, who is chosen by Judah to be the wife of his son Er.  Er treats her cruelly but she remains faithful to him.  God puts Er to death and Tamar then becomes the wife of Judah's second son Onan.  Onan refuses to father a son with Tamar because he knows the son would be considered to be his brother Er's.  After God puts Onan to death, Judah fears that the deaths are connected to Tamar and he banishes her from his household with the promise that she will one day be the wife of his third son, Shelah.  When Tamar realizes that this is an empty promise she uses deceit to persuade Judah himself to father a child.  When Judah discovers the truth, he is ashamed of his own deceit and realizes the consequences of his sin, beginning with the banishment of his brother Joseph whom he refused to protect against his angry brothers.  This is a story revolving around the theme of sin and redemption and gives deeper meaning to the life of Tamar.	2001-06-15

Jabez is a rather obscure character in the Bible who appears in 1 Chronicle 4:9-10.  He is described as &quot;more honorable than his brothers&quot;, but what sets him apart is his powerful prayer.  Wilkinson describes each part of the prayer and explains some of the consequences of praying it each day.  Basically, the prayer asks for increased blessings from God which will lead the believer to a deeper and fuller Christian life which will be characterized by greater responsibility and service.  Wilkinson throws down a challenge to his readers, gives them a method to revitalize their Christian walk and then leaves it squarely up to them as to whether they have the courage to pursue it.	2001-06-15

She is a no-nonsense lady and cleverly includes in the options for the inn the Amish Lifestyle Plan where the guests clean their own rooms. This corresponds to the Amish culture and saves Magdalena a whole lot of work.  Magdalena also cooks for her guests and Myers sprinkles recipes throughout her book.  In her spare time, Magdalena tries to keep her more worldly sister Susannah on the straight and narrow, argues with her tempermental cook, Freni, and works on solving the murders of two of her guests.  She is an interesting and amusing character and is not quite as &quot;over the top&quot; as Myers' heroine, Abigail Timberlake, in the Den of Antiquity series.  This is an enjoyable introduction to the series with amusing characters, complicated enough plot and all the loose ends put together at the end.	2001-06-11

Anne Perry is an exqusite writer.  Her prose is beautiful and she evokes the era of Victorian England in a wonderful and believable way.  In the latest book of this series William Monk and his bride Hester are invited to dinner at the home of Donald Alberton, an arms dealer.  An unpleasant scene occurs when Lyman Breeland, a passionate supporter of the Union discovers that Alberton has already promised a shipment of guns to Philo Trace, a southerner.  Alberton's daughter, Merrit, is in love with Breeland and she argues with him for her father to support the anti-slavery stand.  Alberton claims that he has promised the guns to Trace and cannot back out of the deal, despite his personal feelings about the war in America.  Breeland and Merrit flee and one of the main characters is brutally murdered.  Breeland's watch is found near the murder scene, which puts the suspicion squarely on him.  The rest of the book shifts to American Civil War battlefields and then to a courtroom in England.  The identity of the murderer is elusive and is twisted with personal and political motives.  As always, Perry provides a very good read.	2001-06-01

It chronicals the 62-year-old Episcopal priest's nervousness upon proposing marriage for the first time in his life, describes the gently amusing engagement period, and the disasters and eventual triumph of the actual wedding and honeymoon.  This book falls chronologically into the middle of the series, but gives some charming details about the Kavanaughs' wedding.  Karon's prose often sounds suspiciously like poetry, and her insight into human nature and its frailities and successes is a joy to behold.  Her stories are always lovingly and carefully told and this book about the Mitford years is a worthy addition to its predecessors.	2001-04-30

The book starts out well enough with the wedding of Judith Flynn's son Mike and his long-time girlfriend, Kristen.  We have heard a lot about Mike in previous books in the series, but this is the first time he has actually appeared in one.  While they are at the rehearsal dinner for Mike's wedding, Judith sees a man in a tux pushing a woman in a bridal gown over a balcony.  When her policeman husband Joe is unable to find a body, Judith begins to doubt her sanity.  Thereafter we are introduced to a parade of characters, who seem eccentric but somewhat disconnected.  Judith, of course, continues her own investigation, trying to stay one step ahead of her husband.  The plot is hard to follow and when the killer was revealed I almost didn't care any more.  In her attempt to throw out red herrings, author Danheim just makes this book difficult to read.	2001-04-27

Added to this, Judith and Renie have an unfriendly tenant who is disagreeable to everyone with whom he comes in contact.  Renie argues with him and hits him on the head with a dinner plate when he becomes aggressive and demanding.  He leaves and shortly thereafter, he is found dead.  The cousins fear that Renie's blow may have contributed to his death, but further investigation leads them to several of the island's inhabitants who seem to have a motive for murder.  As usual, the cousins have more success than the local law enforcement officers, and after several red herrings, Judith discovers the identity of the killer.

It revolves around Dr. Temperance Brannan, a forensic anthropologist who divides her time, as does the author, between Montreal, Canada, and North Carolina.  The author is very knowledgable about her field and includes a lot of medical and anatomical detail about the victims and the crime scenes, but many readers are probably not as enamored of these details as author Reichs is.  In this book there have been a number of murders between rival bicycle gangs.  Brannan's job is to sort out and identify the victims, but she extends this to discovering the perpetrators, much to the chagrin of the investigators with whom she works.  The insight into the organization and origination of biker gangs is interesting but again the author probably gives us more information than we need to know.  The book is at its best when Reichs allows Brannen's character to demonstrate her human side when confronted with a rebellious nephew and the defection of her policeman boyfriend to a biker gang.	2001-04-17

Eveyone thinks it's a great idea except for the crabby Enid Goodrich who seems to be lacking in Christmas spirit.  She has been a detriment to the neighborhood for some time and it's hard to find genuine sympathy among her neighbors when she is killed with a hatchet just before Christmas.  Of course this means that there are lots of suspects because Enid has offended almost everyone she has come in contact with.  This includes her rather unsavory relatives who dislike her as much as everyone else.  Judith and her cousin, Renie, do their usual sleuthing job and Judith finally comes up with the identity of the killer.  This is enjoyable reading for fans of this genre.	2001-04-10

When Aunt Petulia is poisoned with chocolate candy, there are many suspects among her greedy heirs.  Wills appear and disappear and it is unclear as to who is to inherit her fortune.  There are several skeletons in the family closet, including illegitimate children and runaway teenagers.  Judith and Renie are led a merry chase trying to discover the identity of the killer.

She goes out with a ranger and a young Earthwatcher named Rory.  Soon Rory disappears during an apparent bear attack and his step-mother who was camping nearby is found dead.  Anna puzzles over the seemingly unrelated clues and considers each person in the area as a possible suspect.  As always, the lovely background of the Park is described in wonderful detail by Barr.  She does go into more detail than necessary on the &quot;blood lure&quot; which is used to attract the bears, but taken as a package, this book is intriguing and well-written.  A reader can always pick up some information from Barr's book, such as the bear research in this one.  Although the premise of the murder may be a bit farfetched, Barr does weave an intriguing tale which keeps the reader guessing until the very end.	2001-03-24

While there they visit their neighbor Riley, who is a renowned artist.  Shortly after their visit, he is killed and is found lying in tempera paint.

As usual, Judith comes up with the answer to the crime and she comes close to being killed herself before the murderer is brought to justice.  Is it just me or does Judith spend more time with her cousin than with her new husband?

She interviews the last remaining member of a prominent, philanthropic, political family.  Thoroughly charmed by him, she is horrified when he dies shortly after the interview.  She decides that it is highly unlikely that his death or the deaths of his family members were accidental, although they were designed to look that way.  She begins investigating and flies all over the world, becoming embroiled in international intrigue and being betrayed by people she considers her closest friends and allies. She is in the process of adopting a 12-year-old son and one wonders about a woman who would abandon him to a new nanny as often as she does in the book.  Also, it seems unlikely that she would so generously encourage her handsome fiance to tend to his ex-wife during her bout with breast cancer.

Marie asks her old friends to join her and her friends who are all luminaries in the theater.  Early in the book there is a murder, and Marie and her friends are the chief suspects.  Judith, of course, feels that she is better qualified to solve the case than are the local police investigators.  She and Renie follow several red herrings and pursue the pasts of each of their eight companions, with sometimes disastrous, sometimes hilarious results.

During the murder investigation, Judith becomes reacquainted with an old flame who is now a police investigator.

The shock of finding themselves in a home with no electricity but plenty of back-breaking chores is lessened by the kindness of their great-grandmother and the beauty of the surrounding mountains. They are befriended by a young boy named Diamond and a local attorney despite the rough treatment they receive by schoolmates who tease them about being Yankees. Life is relatively bucolic in their first year in their new home, but complications set in when greedy men from a natural gas company plot to take away the land where their great-grandmother has lived a lifetime. This book is beautifully crafted by Baldacci and the characters are well-defined and heart warming. This is a winner!	2001-02-04

She is contacted by her old school chum, Emma, who is being blackmailed because of secrets in her past.  In an effort to protect her husband Michael, an aspiring politician, Emma pays off the blackmailers.  People connected with her past begin to commit suicide (at least according to police reports.)  Emma becomes more and more distraught over these situations and Faith tries to help her solve these mysteries.  It is interesting to look into Faith's past and to see how much she loved life in New York.  She can almost convince the reader that New York IS a nice place to live.  As always, her descriptions of the food she prepares are wonderful!	2001-01-28

One of the plusses is that it features Faith Fairchild instead of her less interesting neighbor, Pix Miller.  However, Pix is totally banished except for one or two brief appearances and this does not seem like a good thing to do to Faith's favorite sidekick.  Another plus is the interesting mix of characters, especially Stephanie Bullock, the spoiled young girl whose mother has hired Faith to cater her rehearsal dinner and wedding reception.  However, Faith does seem to obsess over the items which are stolen from her house and they seem to hold a more important place in her affections than do her own children who breeze in and out of her life and into the arms of their father, their babysitters and nursery schools.  Most young mothers are way too busy with their offspring to spend hours skulking about the countryside investigating murders and robberies.  Also the ending is not well conceived and seems too trite.  Not the best of the series, but not a bad read for &quot;cozy&quot; fans.	2001-01-23

In this installment of &quot;The Body.....&quot;  books, Pix accompanies her mother on a trip to Norway.  She has been summoned by her childhood friend, Marit Hansen whose daughter has disappeared after the death of her fiance.  The theory is that since the two young people were tour guides, the group of women can join the tour and discover the culprits to the apparent murder/kidnapping.  The best part of the book is the background of Norway with frequent references to the geography, climate, customs, and food of the country.  Somehow this book doesn't come across as well as others of the series and it's hard to care about characters who are never fully developed.	2001-01-18

Her Aunt Augusta tries to guide her rearing but only succeeds in antagonizing Peyton with her selfish and materialistic values.  Her closest connection is with 2 other outcasts who join her to form The Loser's Club.  When they meet, they share their most humiliating experiences with one another and revel in their shared failures.  Peyton's own favorite failure is her notion that she killed her mother by being born. Suddenly, this circle of negativity is broken by the appearance of Petyon's father's cousin, Nora.  A liberal and free-spirited person, Nora slowly begins to change people's perceptions of themselves.  She has a particular influence on Peyton and begins to open up her world and demonstrate the young girl's many strengths.  Nora is not without her faults.  She is tactless and brazen and succeeds in alienating many of the town's inhabitants.  She also has a shameful secret which Peyton finally uncovers.  This is not Siddons' best book, but her insight into human nature and her beautiful writing style begin to be more evident in the second half of the book.  It is an interesting narrative of the emergence of a young woman from her self-imposed exile.	2001-01-06

Kate is in a state of apathy, but finally her investigative instincts rise to the surface and she begins to check into a scheme which seems to connect the Russians with a local banker and a local politician.

Her sweeping phrases carry the reader to heights and depths of emotions while reading about the Price family.  Nathan, the patriarch, takes his family to the Congo in the late 1950's against the advice of his church and his friends.  He is obsessed with the idea of saving souls in a land of which he has no understanding.  His misguided religious fervor blinds him to the perils to which he has exposed his family.  He rules his family with the hand of a tyrant, using Bible verses as punishment and criticism of his wife and four daughters.  Each chapter is narrated in turn by the five Price women.  They all have distinct personalities and each views the events in their lives in a different way.  Kingsolver compares their struggle for independence with that of the Congo.  She compares the tyranny of Nathan with that of despotic leaders of the Congo.  Her political views are very apparent, but this does not detract from the power of this book.  Oprah recommends it and so do I.	2001-01-01

The controversy becomes broader when the town becomes divided over the new project and those who oppose it begin to receive poison pen letters.  A brick through Lora's window and the destruction of a piece of heavy equipment at the construction site deepen the community's concern.  Soon there are two dead bodies and an attempted poisoning.  Faith, as always, feels that her investigative powers are superior to the police, so she sets up a trap for the person she suspects is the murderer.

The believers resist and there are several martyrs among them who lose their lives to the guillotines which Carpathian imports for just that purpose.  There is one significant convert in this book and the action seems a bit crisper and clearer than in the previous two books.  This book is clearly a transition to the time when the Tribulation Force will be dispersed to gather new believers to thwart Carpathian's plans before they disappear so they are not forced to accept the Mark of Satan.  Hopefully, the remaining 3 years of the Tribulation will not require 8 more books!	2000-12-20

The plot is a simple one.  Jane and Shelley decide to improve their gardening skills by taking a botany class.  Before the class starts, the instructor is beaten and ends up in the hospital with amnesia about the event.  She is replaced by a stodgy old fellow who manages to bore all of the participants with his overly-detailed lectures.  When he encounters an untimely end, Jane and Shelley decide that there is a connection.  Their suspects include all of the eccentric people in their class.  There is very little intrigue in this one, and the false leads that make mysteries so much fun, are missing.  This book is fun, and I wouldn't miss one of the Jane Jeffrey books, but it is definitely lacking in plot and suspense.	2000-12-18

The body is wrapped in a quilt which gives Pix a clue to start her investigation.  This is a departure from the rest of the series in that the main character is Pix instead of Faith.  She is not quite as exciting a character as Faith, but seems to adopt some of her friend's penchant for investigating, sometimes at foolish risk to herself.  A second body is found, also wrapped in a quilt and Pix decides that the two murders must be connected.  Faith appears at the very end of the novel when Pix has almost solved the case.

Yet, it seems that something is missing in this one.  The plot sort of meanders and it plays for laughs instead of being a coherant whole.  Abby and her mother go to an auction at her mother's church.  Since the proceeds are to go towards a van for the youth of the church, Abby decides to participate.  She buys a painting which she knows is a cheap imitation, but she likes the frame that it is in.  She pulls the picture out of the frame in order to sell it to her ex-boyfriend and in doing so, she discovers a VanGogh masterpiece underneath it.  There are a few shady characters who show up wherever Abby is, but no clear-cut suspects.  Also, there are not the usual red herrings and twists and turns of the plot which Myers usually delivers.  Her mother becomes almost a caricature in this novel and the humorous CJ is just a minor player.  Also, she has used about as much mileage out of the character of Hooter as the law allows.	2000-11-01

The lobbyist sometimes resorts to illegal means to accomplish his worthwhile goal of supporting children in underdeveloped nations.  The CIA official is ruthless and uses murder, blackmail, and his considerable influence to further the power of himself and his agency.  In the middle of this intrigue are Faith, the lobbyist's assistant and Lee Adams, a private investigator hired to protect her.  These two are pursued by the CIA and the FBI, but they manage to elude their pursuers while their personal relationship deepens.  There are numerous twists and turns in the plot and credibility is sometimes strained, but it is a good story and keeps the reader guessing to the end.	2000-10-30

He uses many actual people and events from the Storm of 1900, the worst natural disaster in the history of the US.  He writes sketches of the lives of several characters in a flash-back format and then switches to the current time, describing the coming of the storm and the blase manner in which the people approached it.  Weather forecasting was in its infancy, and no one on Galveston Island realized the full impact of the pending storm.  Residents had ridden out many a storm and didn't look at this potent killer in any different way from the storms which had come before.  Galveston's lack of preparation and failure to build a seawall resulted in terrible destruction of life and property.  Rozelle uses these elements to create a story in which the reader learns to care about the characters and then watches the courage with which they faced this catastrophe.  This is a very moving book and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in this subject.	2000-10-28

A timely offer from Tradd, the handsome son of a wealthy family, includes a request for her presence at his grandmother's house to help advise him about her antiques during the course of a family game.  She becomes acquainted with Tradd's siblings, none of whom appear to approve of her appearance in their game.  Before long there is a murder, and Abby is in the middle of finding out which member of this avaricious family is responsible.  In this book, author Myers continues to develop the characters of C.J., Abby's neighboring antique store owner, who is famous for her long, pointless stories, and Abby's mother who rebounds from her unsuccessful attempt to become a nun in the last book, to finding a holy image in Abby's store.  Again, Myers creates a humorous and enjoyable book and manages to have the murderer be the one you would least expect.	2000-10-13

This book details the naivete, pride, and ignorance which was prevalent in the Weather Bureau at this time and which resulted in a city which was totally unprepared for such an emergency.  The best weather minds of the time wrote learned papers which detailed why such a thing could never happen in Galveston.  The US Weather Bureau, in an attempt to establish its own credibility, refused to use or acknowledge information which was available from Cuban weather forecasters.  The book describes the small amount of knowledge which was part of forecasting in those days and describes in detail the actual causes of a storm such as the cataclysmic one described in the book.  Isaac Cline, the head of the Galveston Weather Bureau at the time, is described as a proud man who mirrored his employers' opinion that hurricanes would never hit Galveston with the fury of the Storm of 1900.  He failed to warn the city in time for escape of its inhabitants partly from pride and partly from lack of knowledge.  The best part of the book is the actual description of the storm and the hours before it hit, as the narrative follows the everyday activities of several inhabitants and then the terrible struggle to survive.  This is a well-researched and documented book and is a good resource for anyone interested in this subject.	2000-10-10

Abby's joy turns to concern when she sees that the tea set she has just received is identical to one she purchased at an auction as a one-of-a-kind, expensive silver set.  Her concern is deepened when her engagement announcement is found in the pocket of a dead man in Pennsylvania.  Abby decides that she must investigate this situation up close and personal, so she and her three dearest friends drive to Pennsylvania to look into the matter and hopefully to puchase some antiques and quilts.  Their culture shock at being &quot;north of the Line&quot; is very amusing as is the interaction of these roommates who were not made in heaven.

As usual, Abby considers the police to be too slow, despite the fact that her handsome boyfriend is a detective, and she does some sleuthing on her own.

As in most families, there are varying degrees of greed and lust and Abby spends most of her time conjecturing as to who could have committed the murder.  The author further develops some of the characters from the first book, such as Rob and Bob, and introduces some new ones such as C.J. (Calamity Jane.)

Kinsey Millhone is  ever the irreverant, joke-cracking private investigator, but in this book  her past life is part of the investigation.  She is offered a box full of  memorabilia from her past when her ex-husband defaults on the payments to  his storage area, and the contents are bought by the highest bidder. The  man who buys the contents of the storage area offers them to Kinsey for a  price which her curiosity prods her to pay.

Added to this are the complications of guests  who are arriving, especially Butch's mother who rivals Joanna's own mother  when it comes to tactlessness and nosiness.  Through it all, Joanna manages  to keep her composure, with the help of her soon-to-be groom.  This book  has all the elements of plot and character which make for a very good read.

The subplots in this book are a little more complex than  in the previous books in this series and include a mentally challenged man  who is found wandering aimlessly, a man in a witness protection program,  and a deepening romance for Joanna.  Sprinkled throughout the book are the  usual problems with Joanna's overbearing mother, and her feisty young  daughter.

Her  co-workers still doubt her ability at times, but her straightforward  approach and honesty seem to be winning them over.  In this book, a young  teenager, Bree O'Brien, is brutally murdered on the way to a rendezvous  with her secret lover, Ignacio Yberra.  Her father, who harbors a prejudice  against Mexicans, immediately blames Ignacio.  Mr. O'Brien is a wealthy and  influential man who counts the Governor as a close friend, so Joanna has to  approach the case in a careful and discreet manner.  She decides to treat  it as any other case, and is criticized by a local reporter for not giving  it a higher priority.  At the same time she is drawn into a case where  illegal Freon from Mexico is being smuggled into Arizona.  Eventually these  two cases prove to have some common threads. On the home front, Joanna's  daughter Jenny goes off to camp for the first time, with the usual angst on  the part of both mother and daughter.  Joanna's mother Eleanor pulls a very  surprising move which leaves her a bit bewildered.  I would recommend this  book for anyone who enjoys a good mystery with a look into the personal  life of the heroine.	2000-08-10

In this book, Hal Morgan's beloved wife is run over by a drunk driver  on their 19th. wedding anniversary.  The driver is Bucky Buckwalter, a  veterinarian who serves his short term and some community service, then is  released.  Hal is upset by what he perceives as a mere slap on the wrist,  and becomes very active in Mother's Against Drunk Drivers.  When Bucky is  found dead in a burning building, everyone assumes that Hal is the  murderer.  Everyone except Joanna, that is.

He maintains his sense of humor and simply adds a plot.  The plot defies description but basically it involves a teen-aged boy who  is attempting to &quot;kill&quot; a girl he's interested in with a water  pistol, all of which is part of a game played at his high school.  As he  and a friend approach the girl's home, another duo, who truly are killers,  are attempting a real murder of the girl's father, a man who has embezzled  bribe money from his company.  This situation, coupled with a homeless man  who lives in a tree near the home, and a curious and friendly dog, causes  no end of chaos.  The mental pictures created by Barry's prose are  hilarious.  This book would make a great movie, but Jim Carrey would have  to play several parts in it.

Hints of blackmail and jealousy  are turned up in the course of the investigation.  The problem is deciding  which one was the actual motive for the murder.  The second case has to do  with the bones of an Indian shaman which are discovered in a public park by  some satanic, role-playing teenagers.

The children make an unhappy discovery when the  body of the museum president, Cornelia Moore, is found with a rapier thrust  through it.  The rapier is one of a pair from the museum collection which  is missing.  There are a few false leads, but the community seems to think  it is the Phantom Fencer which supposedly haunts the museum.

In the course of the  book he is saddened by the impending death of his ex-wife, and has some  nice moments with her second husband.  He also sheds tears over the death  of one of the book's central characters.  There are no tears shed over the  intial murder in the book--that of Donald Wolf, a biotech corporation  executive.  He is a womanizer, a rapist, and all around bad guy.  The  identity of the murderer seems obvious at first, but Jance manages to  create new possibilities as the book progresses.  Unlike her previous book,  Lying in Wait,  Jance ties up the loose ends and provides an unusual and  strangely satifying end.  If this is ever made into a movie, Katherine  Hepburn should play Grace Highsmith.	2000-07-20

Jance is a prolific and reliable author, but this book is not up to her usual standards.  The murders in this book are brutal and both follow the same m.o.  A person is burned to death and each finger and toe are  severed.  J.P. Beaumont and his new partner, Sue Danielson, do enough  investigating to make a connection with a Nazi past and some missing gold  from a German death camp.  Perhaps in an effort to infuse something more  exotic into this series, Ms. Jance sacrifices some of the basics of good  writing.  There are indeed, many unanswered questions at the end.  I began  to wonder if I had drifted off somewhere in the reading process!  We do  catch the usual glimpses of the attractive environs of Seattle and J.P.  Beaumont is more human and more attractive as a recovering alcoholic rather  than a man who reaches for a McNaughton's every time the going gets tough.	2000-07-19

What has happened to that sweet, fun-loving librarian, Aurora Teagarden?  This book begins in typical humorous Aurora-fashion with her firewood delivery man going crazy in her front yard by disrobing and  hurling the wood in all directions.  As soon as he is picked up by local  law enforcement, Roe is greeted by the arrival of Martin's niece and her  newborn baby boy.  Roe hadn't received any previous warning of their  arrival and in fact didn't know of the baby's existence.  Soon the baby's  father is found murdered, and the mother disappears.  Martin and Roe take  the baby to Ohio where they hope to solve these mysteries as well as find  someone to take care of the baby.  They find more than they bargain for and  this tale of bedlam turns dark at the end with an ending that will surprise  and probably not please the reader.	2000-07-06

He and Detective Milo Sturgis set out to solve the crime of a psychologist who worked at a hospital for the criminally insane.  The head of the  facility tells them that the Dr. was safe when she was there--it was in the  outside world that she met her untimely end.  The victim had been working  with Ardis Peake, a young man who had brutally murdered his own mother and  another family many years ago.  Her interest in him was spurred by dark  family secrets in her own past, which are uncovered as the plot proceeds.   More murders occur which bear a grisly resemblance to the Dr.'s murder and  which are eerily foretold in the psychotic mutterings of Peake.  There are  many twists and turns until the final solution is revealed.  Kellerman  writes of the inmates with stark realism, but also with a great amount of  understanding.  An interesting book!	2000-07-04

Jackson has definitely mellowed since his marriage to Zee and the birth of their two children.  Now when J.W. is following the bad guys he as often as not has one or both children in tow.  In this latest mystery from  Martha's Vineyard, he has a reunion with Corrie Appleyard, a blues-playing  musician who was a friend of his father's.  Corrie is staying with the  grandson of a friend in one of the dilapidated old houses which are rented  to unwary college students who just want a place on the island which they  can afford.  The landlord and his brother have made a lot of enemies and it  is not surprising when some of their houses are burned.  The arson becomes  too close for comfort when the house Corrie was staying in is burned and a  dead body is found inside.  J.W. spends the rest of the book trying to  solve the mysteries of who burned down the houses and who died in the last  fire.  A subplot concerns a friend of Zee's who is receiving threatening  phone calls from an unknown man.  Enjoyable summer reading!	2000-06-28

Beaumont series	This is the first book of the series that I read and it hooked me and spurred me on to read the rest of them.  Although the author, J.A. Jance is a woman, she writes very convincingly about a male character, J. P.  Beaumont.  We see the struggle between his personal and his professional  life as he is summoned to a Shakespeare Festival where his daughter is  pregnant and soon to be married.  After his arrival, two actors are  murdered and Beaumont uses his professional skills as a policeman to solve  the murder while trying to be civil to his prospective son-in-law and his  daughter's artsy friends.  Beaumont has a wry way of looking at his own  foibles which endears him to readers.  If you enjoy this book, there are  several more in the series.	2000-06-21

I could not  identify with a couple of 20-ish young people of the 30's who inherit a  large home from their uncle, but who have to have paying guests in order to  support their expensive habits.

J.W. is about to propose to his beloved, Zee,  when she is kidnapped.  There is a visit from the Padishah of Sarofim  (where's that?) a missing necklace, and other inexplicable happenings which  add up to a less-than-believable plot.

Although the premise of the book may be a bit far-fetched, it is still entertaining.  Two parallel plots are presented at the beginning.  Three judges who have been incarcerated in a minimum security prison are working  a scam through a homosexual want ad.  At the same time, the head of the CIA  is manipulating his anti-war candidate into the White House.  For awhile  the reader is made to wonder what these plots have in common, but Grisham  in his inimitable fashion finally does connect them.

While a hurricane is raging miles away on the North Carolina coast, a young woman is murdered in a  motel room.  She was known to have been an unfaithful wife and had several  lovers so there are no lack of suspects.  As usual Deborah's large extended  family plays a part in the book, especially her nephew Reid who is a  suspect.  We see a lessening role for Kidd who has been Deborah's lover in  the past several books.  As always the North Carolina setting presents a  pleasing background for this series.	2000-06-16

Using nature as a backdrop is what Barr does best.  She evokes a real sense of the swampy atmosphere of the Natchez  Trace and uses a lot of humor to describe Anna Pigeon's reactions to this  new locale.  Anna has taken on an administrative position in the park  service for the first time and a lot of the book is dedicated to her  discomfort over her new role.  She also has a lot of interesting  interactions with her new co-workers who strive to upset this lady  carpetbagger who has descended on them.

Kate seems philosophical through it  all--from airplanes falling from nowhere to grizzlies appearing in her  path.  She attributes every situation to the time of year.

Her stepson is engaged to his pregnant girlfriend who is a member of a prominent local family.  At a family get-together to announce the  engagement, one of the girl's cousins is killed.  Since her son is about to  marry into this family, it becomes awkward for Benni and her police chief  husband, Gabe, to investigate a murder which appears to have been committed  by a family member.   I did not give this book a 5-star rating because some  of the best characters, i.e., Gabe and Dove, are given minor parts.  Gabe  is often with his ex-wife, hashing out their son's problems and he and  Benni do not have their usual dialogues filled with tension and resolution.   Dove plays a very small part in this book and I missed her down-to-earth  presence.  Also, the revelation about the murder is a rather sobering one.   Still, it's worthwhile reading.	2000-06-13
