The 'Foreword' notes that the discussion about the future funds does not address the more important topic of productive capacity of the economy in 50 or 75 years (p.xv). Most politicians and economists have a poor record in forecasting future events (p.xvi). There are a number of reasonable options available. The word \\"entitlement\\" is used for prejudice against Social Security, which is earned and not granted. The 'Preface' explains the major parts of this book and its 247 pages of text, 64 pages of notes, bibliography, and index. One flaw in this book is the lack of a short summary aimed towards a general audience. It prevents its message from being widely received. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 tells of the propaganda campaign about the need to save Social Security, as if there is some horrible event that will occur in 30 or more years. The biggest expenses for government are education and Social Security, but only the latter has a dedicated source of financing. Some proposed solutions to \\"save\\" Social Security and Medicare are designed to destroy them (p.5) These schemes use ignorance and fear to sway opinions (p.8). The author points out the ignorance about the proposed changes to Social Security (p.9). Projections about the future depend on assumptions, which are based on what a person would like to see (p.11). The author suggests modest changes are all that is needed at this time. Future generations will solve future problems. The \\"irresponsibility\\" is to make changes when you don't know what will happen and do unnecessary damage (p.12). Cutting Social Security and Medicare may be good for the budget, but the government exists to benefit the people, not the budget (p.13). <br /> <br />The advantage of social insurance is explained (p.20). The length of life and need for retirement income is variable. You would need to save the maximum for a worst case situation. But if the money is pooled then people would be protected as a lower cost. The plan for social insurance was a reaction against the Townsend Plan which would pay for pensions out of general revenue. Doing nothing was not an option. Benefits are earned, not given, or won in gambling in the market (p.22). Page 23 explains the redistribution of benefits. Having a pay-as-you-go system also keeps payroll taxes lower (p.24). The cost of living adjustment started in 1972 [after Nixon devalued the dollar in 1971]. Another question is when to finance benefits from general revenues (p.25). [Should capital gains and dividends be taxed?] <br /> <br />Medicaid is given and means-tested; it is not earned. It has both state and federal features, and is less reliable since it varies as t changing income (pp. 34-35). The author points out that people pay taxes for public education even when they receive no benefits (p.36). [Yet people correctly complain against the excessive costs of public education that is paid by regressive taxes.] <br /> <br />Social Security and Medicare allow the retired to live with dignity and security in their old age without becoming a burden on others. The debate over Social Security is not about affordability\\" but of politics: what should be done (p.38).There is a hidden agenda to the attacks on Social Security, one that proponents dare not mention to the public because it is anti-human or anti-people. <br />	2005-10-09

He has long urged that innocent people who were wrongly convicted of crimes should be compensated for their wrongs and injuries ('Preface’). Federal and state governments did not do so (in 1932). Some believed that it is a “physical impossibility” to convict an innocent man. So 65 cases were selected from a much larger number to refute this supposition. Most of these cases were taken from the twentieth century. Fifty of these cases are more important, fifteen are presented concisely. Innocence was established by: the appearance of the alleged murder victim, the conviction of the real culprit, or the discovery of new evidence. This does not include cases of pardon without an admission of erroneous conviction. These cases are mostly due to: mistaken identification, circumstantial evidence (where erroneous inferences are drawn), perjury, or a combination of these errors. There is no index to the people involved.<br /><br />Each of the fifty cases take up about six pages each, the fifteen supplementary cases each have about three pages. The ‘Conclusion’ summarizes the mistakes in these cases. The major source of these errors was the identification of the accused by the victim of a crime of violence. Besides the emotions of the victim, other factors enter (desire for revenge, support an identification made by others). In many of these cases there was a little resemblance between the wrongfully accused and the actually guilty criminal. Little scientific study has been done on the effects of suggestion or defective powers of observation. There are enough wrongful convictions on circumstantial evidence to be disturbing. Circumstantial evidence coming from different sources is less likely to be false. But evidence can be manufactured or suppressed (p.369). Presenting evidence of a prior conviction can prejudice a jury against a defendant (p.370). The use of thethird degree” to produce confessions is a public disgrace (p.371). Such “confessions” are a factor in wrongful convictions. Public opinion can be blamed when passions are aroused and demand a sacrificial victim. How many wrongfully convicted have been executed is impossible to say (p.373). There are problems in the unreliability of “expert” evidence. An alibi or collateral testimony which is false will be extremely prejudicial to the defendant, even if innocent. A defendant who is poor and can’t hire a competent attorney will be convicted (p.374). Borchard recommends an independent investigating committee to consider certain cases (p.375). An appeals court should review cases on the facts as well as on the law in felony or at least capital cases. A review on the facts could set aside an unjust verdict, and correct errors in the administration of justice (p.376). Borchard recommends the NY law that allows an appeal court to order a new trial if the verdict was against the weight of evidence or against law, even if no exception was taken in court.<br /><br />Borchard thinks highly of English law (pp.377 378) and its laws on paper. But that didn’t save an innocent from the gallows (“10 Rillington Place”) and the abolishment of capital punishment around 1962. Borchard urges the adoption of legislation to indemnify the wrongfully convicted. Any amounts should be adjusted for the devalued currency (or “inflation”).	2005-09-29

Fleming's grandfather became a millionaire through his banking investment trusts in American railroads. Fleming's father was a banker, country squire, Member of Parliament, and Major. Young Ian was the second son and a difficult child who had troubles at schools. Fleming was sent to Europe to learn French, German, and Russian; all practical skills for his future as a reporter (spy trials in Moscow) and Commander in Naval Intelligence during WW II. Fleming set up an \\"Intelligence Commando\\" to quickly seize information from freshly captured enemy command posts. \\"Advance Unit 30\\" was commemorated in the \\"AU 30\\" license plate on Goldfinger's limousine. Great success came around 50 with his action novels, and the films of these stories. These films have been successes for over 40 years, even when they repeat earlier stories and the action scenes therein.<br /><br />Fleming had an important career as a journalist before his fame as the author of \\"James Bond\\". He often used the names of friends and relatives for characters in his books. \\"Quarrel\\" was based on Red Grant, whose name was used for the killer in \\"From Russia With Love\\". When these novels gained popularity after 1961 \\"James Bond\\" was criticized for his cruelty, hedonism, and amorality. When you read this biography you will understand the basis for this fictional character. Fleming was a model for some of these deeds, but \\"James Bond\\" is the fantasy character Fleming wanted to be (pp.177-178). The last half of this book covers Fleming's last twelve years, when he found fame and fortune as an author. The continuing films keep his memory alive, unlike John Buchan or E. Philip Oppenheim.<br /><br />The existing censorship at the time prevented any mention of Ian Fleming's meeting with J. Edgar hoover in July 1941. Fleming brought Dusko Popov, Yugoslav playboy, Nazi spy, and British double-agent to tell of Popov's orders to spy on Pearl Harbor. Hoover wasn't interested, and Popov was then forced to leave the country.rders to spy on Pearl Harbor. Hoover wasn't interested, and Popov was then forced to leave the country.	2005-09-27

From around the 1940s media censorship presented American history like the 1890s as \\"The Good Old Days\\", a time of happiness and prosperity, like the magazine covers illustrated by Norman Rockwell. Many historians believe there was a \\"major crisis in American life during the 1890s\\". This refers to the worst economic depression in 19th century America. This book is an antidote to that manufactured propaganda myths. The problem with creating a book from unknown photographs and random newspaper clippings is the lack of a unifying outlook. By not telling about the context of those times the book continues that cover-up. There is no explanation to diet, drugs, hunger, malnutrition, poverty, alcoholism, syphilis and other causes of the mental illnesses listed here. Presenting only such news distorts history. Similar news is usually censored nowadays, unless it is part of a reported crime. Back in the 1950s the local newspaper used to have a back page with such news. Many of the items were for men indicted \\"for unlawful carnal knowledge\\". The editing of newspapers stories must represent a tiny portion of those twenty years, as realistic as items from a weekly tabloid newspaper.<br /><br />If you hear talk about \\"the good old days\\" you should know that life then was often \\"short, mean, and nasty\\". If we neglect this lesson of history will these times reoccur? Look and see for yourself. One thing is different. Suicide is rarely mentioned in the newspapers, they call it \\"died at home\\" in the obituary columns. You are seven times more likely to die of suicide than murder at home in America. Children are always safer in school than at home.<br /><br />The dates on the newspaper items for \\"1885-6\\" suggest it was a weekly. The `Conclusions' recalls and mocks the science of yesteryear. Is fiction like \\"The Jukes\\" repeated in today's books? What will the future say about the psycho-babble here? Lesy is wrong in imagining that the suicides and murders in the rural country were not occurring in the city. Lesy's comments about \\"paranoia\\" and psychology seem like a compulsion for a historian. Is this a fitting ending to his work? There is no mention of food and diet here, even while scientific research was examining the causes of pellagra! Now that Lesy is older and wiser, how would he rate this book? Why are there no page numbers?	2005-09-24

[Do some people have a similar view when it comes to the economy?] Thucydides described the Great Plague of Athens, but wouldn’t speculate as to its origin (p.73). Fracastor first used the word virus to denote the germ of contagion (p.34). Rosebury suggests that the “leprosy” of Medieval times was really syphilis (p.47). Leprosy is bacteriologically related to tuberculosis. Chapter 8 discusses polio, and its spread with the wider use of the flush toilet (p.77)!<br /><br />Part II discusses “Literature, Art, and Music”. Chapter 9 lists quotes from the Old Testament to suggest “leprosy” meant gonorrhea and syphilis (p.90). Chapter 10 discusses the works of Shakespeare, his knowledge of medicine (Hippocrates and Galen). [Now you know what those obscure words mean.] Rosebury said Ibsen’s “Ghosts” shocked Victorians because it portrayed death and disease as a punishment for virtue, not the wages of sin (p.114). Chapter 13 tells of the effect of syphilis on famous people, facts usually censored from biographies (p.130). Pages with names of famous people follow. [No mention of Lenin of Stalin or any American politicians.] What happens when an absolute ruler is affected by irritable inconsistency and delusions of grandeur (p.135)? Mankind has long believed that disease was a punishment for sin, or the work of evil spirits (Chapter 14). This chapter ends on an optimistic note, as VD is close to being eliminated. This 1971 book does not list chlamydia or AIDS.<br /><br />Part III presents “Facts and Figures”. These chapters are more technical. While penicillin was a miracle drug in the 1940s it began to lose effectiveness in the late 1960s (p.204). Does the treatment of syphilis in China sound “too good to be true” (p.220)? Part IV deals with “Control: Past, Present, Future”. Chapters 19 and 20 discuss the Futility and Failures in treatment. Chapter 21 tells of the need for a vaccine for syphilis, and a blood test for gonorrhea (p.250). Page 257 tells of the effect of a “liberalizing” law, and its commercial uses for tourists! Chapter 22 discusses the chances for a vaccine. A successful vaccine would have to be used by children in elementary and high schools to be effective. But this would create other problems (Chapter 23). Control of VD requires changes to habits and conduct, a difficulty for human nature (p.278). The ‘Conclusion’ presents a summary.	2005-09-24
36986:US	38002140	R3F1K5054OBJP1	0380016362	500864378	Laura: The Life of Laura Ingalls Wilder	Books	5	16	18	N	N	The Pioneer Girl	The stories about life as a Pioneer Girl made Laura Ingalls Wilder forever famous in America. This biography tells of the world of reality behind the stories. The author used documented records as well as Laura's unpublished memoirs for the authentic story of her life. It tells about the events that were not put in the books, and the later life as a farm wife and writer in Missouri. New facts add to the memories recorded in her books. <br /> <br />Changes were made for her publisher's request. There is no mention of the birth and death of little Charles. Laura describes their well, but not the outhouse. Some people were simplified into composite characters. The publication during the Great Depression also meant a constraint on events. There is nothing on elections and politics, but these were written from the viewpoint of a young girl. More people learned about frontier life from her books than from a historian like F. J. Turner (p.x). <br /> <br />Are these books historical fiction or plain facts? Rose Wilder Lane said they are the truth as Laura remembered it (p.246). Much of it is true as it happened. But unaided memory after 50 years can be tricky. There were changes between the draft manuscript and the final published version. The truth of these books is in the outlook of the life of Laura. Life is different now, but the real things haven't changed. \\"It is still best to be honest and truthful; to make the most of what we have; to be happy with simple pleasures and to be cheerful and have courage when things go wrong\\" (p.248). The philosophy in this seems to avoid united action, unlike some of the stories in the books. Read them for yourself: government grants (Homestead Law), charity from Back East (Christmas barrels), the college for Mary, local organizing. Overall the Ingalls go from self-sufficient owners to wage-earning workers using store--bought goods. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 tells about life in the Big Woods of Wisconsin, and the economics of buying land(p.18). But Pa wanted to move to Kansas, and they did. Chapter 2 tells about the long trek, and the importance of homesteading. But Pa was a squatter, he never filed a claim. Margaret Clement was able to locate their property (pp.35-36). Fevers were as common as mosquitoes. Chapter 3 tells of their return to the Big Woods. But then they left for good. Chapter 4 tells about life in Minnesota, by Plum Creek, on the flat fertile prairie. Their crops were destroyed by a hail of locusts, and they moved away. Chapter 5 tells of the Ingalls family removal to Burr Oak Iowa. Chapter 6 has the Ingalls at Walnut Grove. Laura learned that life is not always kind or nice (p.128). Pa wasn't doing well, Aunt Docia had a job available, and they moved again to Silver Lake (Chapter 7). They suffered the Long Winter. Chapter 8 has more information on the Golden Years, Laura's teenage years. Chapter 9 tells of Laura and Almanzo's life together, a time that was grim and dark with worry (p.209). Laura thought of herself as a 'Pioneer Girl' (p.212). Their problems were typical of debtor farmers. Other hardships followed (pp.213-214). They moved away to a place that was not too cold or too hot - the Ozarks (p.217). They soon had a paying farm (p.219). During this time Laura wrote for newspapers (p.229). After the death of Ma and Mary, Laura began to write her memoirs (p.233). Laura's life taught her \\"courage, self reliance, independence, integrity, and helpfulness\\" (p.239). At age ninety Laura followed the rest of her family to the days of auld lang syne. <br />	2005-09-23

Patterson, Governor of West Virginia. Warden Orel J. Skeen felt that a condemned prisoner was not guilty and called the \\"Court of Last Resort\\". Robert B. Bailey was convicted of murder by an eyewitness even while he was arrested drunk several miles away. The Governor commuted Bailey's sentence and called for a new investigation of this case. Not every governor would give up a few hours of his holiday to review the evidence on a closed case.<br /><br />John Carver Billings II visits the Cool & Lam agency. He first danced with Morrie, then was dumped by her. He then spent the night with Sylvia and Millie. Morrie has gone missing, and Billings II wants them to find Sylvia and Millie to establish his alibi. Lam sees problems in his story, Cool only sees his money. But who is John Carver Billings II? So Lam starts his investigation to track two unknowns on behalf of another unknown. And he succeeds, so the client is happy. But Lam know this \\"paper trail\\" was left for him to find! So Lam goes back to the motor court to re-investigate, and finds a clue that brings him to San Francisco, and he finds out more about that night, and more about the Billings. Then Lam finds information about a hit-and-run accident. Also about the discovery of the body of Morrie (Maurine Auburn), shot twice in the back.<br /><br />Lam warns Millie about her life-style choice (Chapter 4). It won't work in the long run, she's only \\"a cog in the economic and social machine\\". Millie craves action, variety, and luxury. In Chapter 11 Lam reads about a wealthy mining man who has gone missing, and goes to interview his wife. Lam learns something about George Bishop, the first link to the Billings. He gives advice to Mrs. Bishop. Lam surmises the connection between Billings II and the need for an alibi. Billings I tells Lam of the mysterious mining operations of George Bishop (Chapter 12). And so we find out about the puzzle of the body in the yacht - it isn't there!Lam tells about a test for bloodstains. Would there be bloodstains if the carpet was brand new? Then Lam gets information from the accountant (Chapter 14). More facts are discovered by Lam in talking to Mrs. Bishop.<br /><br />The police search of the crime scene found the murder weapon and the fingerprints of Billings (Chapter 16). Lam describes \\"The Green Door\\" and its adjoining shops. Lam investigates to uncover more facts, only to be trapped and threatened for a while. A phone call to \\"George Granby\\" serves as a deus ex machina to end his predicament. And so this puzzle is solved in the police station (Chapter 19). The Billings are freed. Lam's return to the home office is played out for its comedic value. Note the modern touches here (college basketball). The bonanza in the gold mine stock sounds like insider trading.

Being `actually innocent' is not grounds for a release from prison in the criminal justice system without a new trial (Sheppard vs. Ohio). This decision must be made in a court of law, not in some laboratory. The `Preface' tells of the beginning of the \\"Innocence Project\\" which uses DNA tests to free convicts who were innocent (p.xiv). This has \\"exposed a system of law that has been far too complacent about its fairness and accuracy\\" (p.xv). It can be due to: mistaken eyewitnesses, racism, rigged lab tests, inattentive defense lawyers, lying prosecutors. [We know how DNA evidence can be forged or fabricated, like fingerprints. There is no limit to human error.] But DNA tests only work with biological evidence, and they wonder how many were wrongfully convicted in other crimes? \\"Eyewitness error remains the single most important cause of wrongful convictions. If the prosecution holds back the evidence for DNA tests, a conviction prevents the right to have them done\\" (p.xvi). William Rehnquist agreed! Government statistics do not keep track of the number of innocent persons who are convicted (p.xvii).<br /><br />Eyewitness testimony was known to be unreliable in the 19th century (Mass. vs. Borden), especially when the people are not well-known to each other. Are false confessions the obverse of misidentification? Chapter 4 explains why you should never talk to the police without your lawyer present. Police are rewarded for closing cases not leaving them open. Prosecutors are also responsible for false convictions (p.101), especially in this case (p.105). Chapter 5 discusses \\"scientific evidence\\"as it has been presented in far too many cases. How many other cases has prosecutorial perjury been passed for science (p.116)? This will continue until there are independent laboratories that are reliable. [See the book \\"Tainting Evidence\\".] Chapter 6 has examples of prosecutorial perjury. Could hairs be planted for evidence (p.151)? Page 157 tells of safeguards against false information. Chapter 7 deals with the \\"junk science\\" of hair analysis and its weaknesses (p.162). There is a need to regulate crime laboratories (p.170). Chapter 8 tells of \\"harmless error\\", deliberate misstatements used to convict suspects (pp.174-175). A prosecutor can't be sued for knowingly allowing perjured testimony (p.180)! Are Federal prosecutors exempt from ethical rules (p.181)?<br /><br />Chapter 9 shows the need for capable defense lawyers. Does the low pay for indigents' lawyers in Texas result in a higher number of executions (p.189)? President Clinton and Speaker Newton Gingrich made it easier to convict the innocent (p.190)! Public defenders are overworked and underpaid (p.191). Chapter 10 tells how \\"Race\\" can result in the conviction of a man later found innocent by DNA evidence. Chapter 11 shows how a heinous crime demands a conviction. The need to cover the face of a suspect is to avoid false witnessing (p.215). Page 217 tells how an innocent comment can be twisted into a sign of guilt. One out of eight condemned to death is later freed as totally innocent (p.218)! Chapter 12 tells of the problems facing the wrongly convicted. The test for counterfeiting evidence is on pages 236-237. Sometimes people see what they believe, not the other way around (p.237). Chapter 13 has lessons from crimes. Conviction of an innocent may mask a serial murderer (p.244). If DNA tests were done right away it could eliminate suspects (p.245). [Unless a blood sample would be used to frame a suspect.] No state has an Innocence Commission to review convictions (p.246).<br /><br />Appendix 1 has a short list of reforms to protect the innocent.<br /><br />Erle Stanley Gardner and the \\"Court of Last Resort\\" pioneered investigations into the wrongfully convicted around 1948 (p.249). Gardner's advocacy for the use of forensic science educated generations of his readers. His books outsold the totals of his competitors. \\"Potboilers\\"? Shame on the authors! Gardner's stories warned of the dangers of invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. Some stories made the point that while ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (during or after the crime). \\"Perry Mason\\" advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer. There is a famous true crime that has the above elements. Sacco & Vanzetti were convicted of robbery and murder in spite of their alibis and the lack of guilty evidence. Most believe they were innocent and were convicted as part of the political repression of the 1920s.	2005-09-23

Young Buster worked as a newsboy and a caddy, and enjoyed sports especially football and boxing. He tells of his job at the Bank of Commerce (pp.20-21). Buster traveled around the country doing various jobs which prepared him to become a stuntman. He had other jobs and businesses; people learned never to cross him (p.37).   Part II tells of his work as a stuntman in Hollywood pictures, and scenes off-camera. Her worked with Errol Flynn and became friends due to their sports interests. Errol’s father was a Professor of Marine Biology at Queen’s College in Belfast Ireland. Buster tells of his work in “High Sierra” where he played the rifleman who shot “Roy Earle”, then doubled for Bogart to fall down the mountain (p.90). His main training was to run seven miles a day. After Pearl Harbor Errol Flynn was deferred due to heart murmur and tuberculosis (kept secret). Flynn did work for British intelligence (pp.112-113). Flynn sold War Bonds, and visited Alaska to entertain soldiers.   Part III tells of his life after quitting the movie business; aches and pains took longer to heal. Buster worked as an agent for jockeys, and traveled up and down the Pacific Coast. His advice for betting on horses is on page 175. Buster loved the excitement of gambling, but his winnings often disappeared as fast as he got them. Buster was shocked to hear of Errol Flynn’s death, but he knew he lived fast. The legends about Flynn aren’t all true (p.185). Buster wrote this autobiography to correct the misinformation in the CBS film that fictionalized Flynn’s life (p.202). He sets the record straight.   The important part of this book is the Appendix by William Donati, who checked the sources for Higham’s biography. Wiles told of the lies in that book (p.208). Those who knew Flynn, like David Niven, didn’t believe that book (p.210). The declassified documents show that it was not Errol Flynn but Dr. Hermann Erben who was the subject of investigation. There was nothing to Higham’s story (pp.211-212). Dr. Erben first met Flynn in 1933 before Flynn began acting in Britain. Higham modified an official document to support his story (p.221)! Donati interviewed Dr. Erben (pp.229-237). Other examples of Higham’s errors are given (pp.249-260). If Charles Higham can’t be trusted (p.261) how reliable is his story? Does this controversy arise from the uncorroborated writings of Dr. Erben (p.264)? Did he create a notional agent for money?	2005-09-21

Edgar Hoover, Sex, and Crime: An Historical Antidote	Books	2	2	4	N	N	He Only Followed Orders	This book was written to deny the claims of Anthony Summers that Hoover dressed in women's clothes at orgies. Given that the lack of corroboration, that claim is easily refuted (p.41). Curt Gentry's book told that Hoover's real crime was filing false expense reports. Athan Theoharis argues that Hoover's disinterest is organized crime was the result of a \\"lack of accountability\\"!! Hoover was not from a wealthy and powerful family, his career depended on pleasing powerful politicians by using his personal skills and talents (p.79). Hoover was first promoted under Wilson, kept his job under Harding, Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, and then Franklin Roosevelt (who increased his powers). Hoover curried favor with powerful businessmen (p.40), and also sought information to stay in power (p.72). Hoover didn't investigate syndicated crime as long as the ruling Power Elite wanted that. Congressmen controlled the FBI budget, and Hoover got along by going along. [After the US Secret Service investigation sent a Senator and Congressman to jail, their budget was cut.] Naval Intelligence worked with organized crime during WW 2. Hoover's statement \\"no single individual or coalition of racketeers dominates organized crime across the nation\\" (p.17) is still true today; read that closely. Hoover collected scandalous news a necessary self-protection in the political jungle of Washington (p.72). If Hoover concentrated on left-wing groups rather than La Cosa Nostra he was just following orders (p.139). <br /> <br />Chapter One discusses the personal character of Hoover, but not his family background. The charge of homosexuality was often \\"used by persons who wanted to smear someone\\" (p.27). One example concerns three high-level aides of Nixon (pp.30-31)! Hoover wanted \\"sworn statements\\" from them denying their homosexuality; did he get them? [Any chance to forge them?] Hoover quickly suppressed such rumors (pp.34-38). Could a \\"sex photograph\\" have existed in 1946 (p.47)?[Composite photographsare possible, and actors with make-up to double for real people.] Chapter Two tells about the collecting of personal information of a sexual nature and how it was used for political purposes. [That went on with the Founding Fathers!] Prominent personalities could be controlled and political agendas could be promoted with the possession of this knowledge. [Remember one of the \\"Honeymooner\\" shows where Ralph tells Alice she is a \\"Mrs. J. Edgar Hoover\\"? What did Jackie Gleason mean?]  <br /> <br />Chapter Three discusses the expanded Federal powers of the New Deal. [Actually, that started earlier with Prohibition.] The purpose of the New Deal was to save the Power Elite by triage of malfunctioning units (p.120). The failing economy was followed by a rising crime rate (p.121). The expansion of federal powers was presented as a moral conflict between good and evil, divorced from economic reality. Hollywood produced is melodramas (p.125). [No connection here between the end of a \\"well-regulated militia\\" and the rise of organized crime.] FDR re-assigned counter-intelligence from the US Secret Service to the FBI (pp.127-128). The FBI took an interest in politicians (p.135). FBI wiretaps immunized crime bosses from prosecution (p.141)! The justification for secret, illegal bugging practices is on page 150. The protection of organized crime by the Attorney General is on pages 151-152. Read it for yourself! <br /> <br />Presidents, attorneys-general, Congressmen, and others cooperated with and benefitted from J. Edgar Hoover (p.160). Was the ACLU then controlled by the FBI (p.163)? The summary on page 164 only underlines Hoover's role as an enforcer for the Power Elite. <br /> <br />	2005-09-21

Books	1	3	4	N	N	Nix On Hixson's Stories	Hixson has picked four murder cases as \\"highly revealing\\" as to \\"history, culture, and jurisprudence\\". He is mistaken in his judgments. What is the purpose of this book? Was it created as propaganda for the last case? A good history is based on reality, not the author's prejudices about \\"gender\\", \\"nativism\\", \\"class anxieties\\", or \\"racial injustice\\" (p.2). His arrogance is shown in his comments on page 3 regarding other's works. Hixson seems proud of not using footnotes, and points to his \\"critical bibliography\\". <br /> <br />Hixson has no excuse for failing to list David Kent's \\"Forty Whacks\\", the one best volume on this murder. In 1960 Edward Radin went to Fall River to re-investigate this case; he was a reporter who attended hundreds of murder trials. His book ended with a suggestion that Bridget did it, a new solution that would sell his book. Did Hixson read this book? Frank Spiering's book has a lot of background material, including the financial motives for arresting a suspect. A relative and heir of Lizzie did in fact offer this solution, however \\"far-fetched\\". Arnold R. Brown's book is based on the personal recollections of Henry Hawthorne plus the investigations noted in his book. It is the final chapter until someone writes a better solution. <br /> <br />Anthony Scaduto is another newspaper reporter who investigated this long-closed case to bring out new evidence: Hauptmann's time sheet had been blotched to hide evidence that he worked in Brooklyn that day. It seems impossible for Hauptmann to drive to a distant rural spot on a day when the Lindberghs would normally be absent. Ludovic Kennedy's book also raises serious questions as to Hauptmann's guilt of kidnapping. Hixson appears wrong in rejecting these books. As to a \\"Lindbergh baby\\" being alive, that is also likely. Lindbergh was a superstar like today's sports stars or musicians, it was possible for him to meet his groupies. We now know of one family in Germany. Did Hixson put that in his book? Notunderstanding this suggests a naive ivory-tower academic. <br /> <br />James Neff's book tells of the commercial rivalry in this case. Hixson says Dr. Sam Sheppard was wrongfully convicted, but I wonder what he would have said back in 1954, if he dared to speak out then? Note how he praises Paul Holmes' work, even thought this reporter pointed to a married couple as being guilty! No quaint sneer about \\"historical accuracy\\"? <br /> <br />The last case may have motivated this book. O. J. Simpson was correctly found \\"not guilty\\". It took a new law and a biased judge to fix the wrongful death suit. Hixson should be ashamed of his poor choice in the bibliography. One of the first books was Stephen Singular's \\"Legacy of Deception\\" which told of his investigation until stopped by the LAPD. Vincent Bugliosi never attended the trial; his book is his opinions of the case. The other books cited were written to justify the actions of the authors. Hixson has no excuse for failing to list Donald Freed & Raymond Briggs? \\"Killing Time\\", the one best volume on this case. It is the only book to contain the autopsy reports, and offers arguments both for and against guilt. No other book is objective enough to offer an opposing viewpoint! Certainly not Hixson's and that is why he gets a low score. Aside from his bias, it provides a condensed digest of four sensational murder trials. Just don't believe everything you read. Lizzie Borden was \\"not guilty\\", and O. J. Simpson is innocent. <br /> <br />Pages 141-142 tell about rigging a lie detector test in 1954. Page 202 tells about emotions affecting lie detector tests. How many people wrote this book? <br />	2005-09-16

Lee	Books	4	5	6	N	N	A Fighter Pilot in 1917	Arthur Gould Lee was a young pilot with the Royal Flying Corps in 1917. These letters were written to his wife from his Fighter Squadron in France. The airmen of the First World War were the first to give battle in this new frontier. They engaged in single combat like the knights of medieval times. Airplanes were first used for reconnaissance, like aerial cavalry. Then the enemy began to shoot them down. Next began the individual combat between airplanes in 1916 and 1917. By 1918 large disciplined formations clashed in vast dog-fights. They were regarded as knights, but most came from social levels other than the nobility of Europe. Most were young, and had a high wastage rate (p.xvii). The majority did their job without the glory of becoming an ace. This book contains the modified letters he sent home from the front. They tell of his experiences, but this will not interest the general public.<br /><br />Appendix A discusses the Failure of the High Command. They designed a standard government aeroplane for aerial reconnaissance which was totally unsuitable for offense or defense (p.213). Britain lacked a flourishing aircraft industry, like in France or Germany. Creating a monopoly leads to a loss in quality (p.214). The Admiralty did not make this mistake, so the Royal Navy supplied their surplus to the Royal Flying Corps. The survivors of this debacle prevented this from re-occurring in WW II.<br /><br />Appendix B discusses the Strategy of the Offensive and its distant patrols. This caused extra losses and wear and tear on pilots and planes by continuous patrols along the whole British front (p.217). The Germans concentrated superior numbers as it suited them, and caused heavy British air losses (p.218). Sending obsolescent machines deep into enemy territory was as irrational as Haig's adherence to attrition or the Admiralty's resistance to escorted convoys. This was not repeated in WW II.<br /><br />Appendix C discusses the lack of parachutes for airmen. Two explanations were given (no official documentation exists). The claim that no reliable parachutes existed in 1917-1918 was not true (p.219). The other claim that pilots would give up without a fight was contradicted by daily action in France. The effect of having a parachute was to encourage an extra effort, as shown in WW II (p.223). The disavowal of parachutes came from senior officers who had no flying experience! A decision was made in September 1918 to order parachutes, but the war ended before they could be used (p.225). Time purged the decision makers by WW II.	2005-09-16

A Medical Examiner can determine if a death was murder, suicide, or accidental. This book is dedicated to Joseph B. Fallon, recently retired Deputy Superintendent of the Boston Police Department. Fallon was a shrewd interrogator who taught and trained his picked investigators to carry on his skills.  <br /> <br />Della Street tells Perry Mason that a new client is waiting impatiently to see him. Audrey Bicknell has five tickets on a horse in a race, and wants them cashed in if the horse has won. Perry wants more information to protect himself. Audrey wants cash only, no cashier's check (Chapter 1). The radio says this long shot paid off 27 to 1! After Perry cashes them in, a police detective and Marvin Fremont claim the money was embezzled by Rodney Banks. They have no proof of any connection to Perry Mason. Perry returns the call from Audrey Bicknell, and finds her name is Nancy Banks! Perry finishes this business with receipts for everything (Chapter 4). Acting for Nancy Banks, he puts up bail money for Rodney Banks, her brother (Chapter 5). <br /> <br />Then Perry gets a phone call summoning him to see Nancy Banks. Her motel room is empty, but a check of the bathroom finds a dead body! Then Nancy shows up with a story about being robbed at her apartment; her hands are ice-cold. Nancy doesn't want to call the police. But when Nancy admits to finding the body earlier, Perry calls Lt. Tragg in Homicide, who then questions Nancy about her day's events. Nancy is too upset to answer all the questions, so she is free until tomorrow (Chapter 7). Perry now has a new client who may be holding out information. <br /> <br />But Nancy disappears on her return to her apartment! Paul Drake calls Perry, Larsen Halstead is there with a story about Marvin Fremont's business and it bears on Rodney and Nancy Banks. Wehear about Fremont's dealing in antique jewelry (Chapter 10). Perry calls Lt. Tragg to report this, and learns the police are looking for Halstead. Perry finds out where Nancy Banks is staying. Perry visits Nancy and gets her story (Chapter 11). They discover a secret in Marvin Fremont's remote past life (Chapter 12) and in his business (Chapter 13).  <br /> <br />Chapter 14 finds Nancy Banks charged with first-degree murder. The body was found in the shower of her motel room. Was this in fact the murder site? Perry suavely sidesteps a baited prosecution witness. The police tell of finding the murder weapon, which was owned by Marvin Fremont! Does the District Attorney have a trick up his sleeve, based on a new law (Chapter 15)? Rodney Banks refuses to testify, but Hamilton Burger grants immunity to get answers (Chapter 16). What he says shocks and surprises everyone! Burger is so upset that Perry tries to calm him down. Then when witnesses are recalled we get a completely surprising ending that definitely clears Perry's client. The final explanatory chapter has a weakness in explaining the placement of a hundred-dollar bill, but is balanced by the trial testimony and cross-examination. <br />	2005-09-08

Audrey Bicknell has five tickets on a race horse and wants them cashed in if the horse won. This long shot paid off 27 to 1! Perry cashes them in, but a police detective and Marvin Fremont claim the money was embezzled by Rodney Banks. They have no proof of any connection to Perry. Perry returns the call from Audrey Bicknell, and finds her name is Nancy Banks! Perry provides receipts for everything. Acting for Nancy he puts up bail money for her brother Rodney Banks. Perry gets a phone call to see Nancy. Her motel room is empty, a dead body is in the bathroom! Nancy shows up with a story about being robbed at her apartment; her hands are ice-cold. When Nancy admits to finding the body earlier, Perry calls Lt. Tragg in Homicide, who then questions Nancy about her day’s events. Nancy is too upset to answer all the questions, so she is free until tomorrow. Perry’s client may be holding out information. Nancy disappears on her return to her apartment! Paul Drake calls Perry, Larsen Halstead is there with a story about Marvin Fremont’s business and how it bears on Rodney and Nancy Banks. Fremont deals in antique jewelry. Perry calls Lt. Tragg, and learns the police are looking for Halstead. Perry visits Nancy and gets her story. They discover a secret in Marvin Fremont’s past life and his business. Nancy is charged with first-degree murder. The body was in her motel room. Was this in fact the murder site? The police tell of finding the murder weapon, which was owned by Marvin Fremont! Does the District Attorney have a trick up his sleeve, based on a new law? Rodney Banks refuses to testify, but Hamilton Burger grants immunity to get answers. What he says shocks and surprises everyone! Burger is so upset that Perry tries to calm him down. Witnesses are recalled to get a surprising ending that definitely clears Perry’s client.<br /><br />“Lonely Heiress” (1948) begins when Robert Caddo, the publisher of “Lonely Lovers Publications”, visits Perry Mason. Heran an anonymous ad, the authorities investigate it. Caddo wants Mason to verify this item. Caddo explains the market for this publication. Perry wonders if this ad is part of a scheme. One letter draws a reply, and Perry will have detectives who can spot and follow “MM”. Perry and Della visit Union Depot to watch the meeting. Perry reports the facts to Caddo. Later Perry gets a report from the young detective who met “MM”; was there a trick? An errand brings Perry and Della back to Union Depot, and they see familiar faces. Later Marilyn Marlow visits Perry to ask for help with the problem about a will. She explains the purpose of her ad. Dolores is upset by her husband’s involvement with “MM”; she’s not so dumb. Perry tries to calm her and fails, so he warns Marilyn Marlow. Bob Caddo shows up. They learn Rose Keeling has been murdered! Perry questions Marilyn and stand by his client. Lt. Tragg arrives and questions Perry and Della. They try to visit the other witness, Ethel Furlong. Perry is fooled by appearances. Perry meets the Endicott family: Ralph, Palmer, and Lorraine. Marilyn Marlow is intensively questioned and she blurts out some facts to Sergeant Holcomb. Lt. Tragg takes her to his office; an example of ‘bad cop, good cop’. Dolores Caddo met Rose Keeling after 11 am. Mr. & Mrs. Caddo deny everything to Lt. Tragg. Did they outsmart Perry? No one seems to have a motive for the murder except Perry’s client. Perry and Della take another look at Rose Keeling’s apartment. Della knows the difference between packing and unpacking. They get a big surprise when they leave. The Preliminary Hearing tell how a bloody knife was found hidden in Marilyn’s car, wiped clean of any fingerprints. On their return Perry and Della see Robert Caddo with the Endicott brothers. The cross-examination of Lt. Tragg involves the difference betweenpacking and unpacking clothes. Paul Drake gets more information. An important fact arises from the use of the a new and rare ballpoint pen. The case against Marilyn Marlow is dismissed, and Perry explains the solution. “Once you get the correct solution all of the evidence fits into place.”	2005-09-08

Those in the Cleveland area believed Dr. Sam was guilty, those living further away were more likely to believe in his innocence (p.xi). Biased coverage by the media can affect people for decades. While this book was being written, the prosecutors tried to commandeer his research (p.xii). The author is a prize-winning journalist and editor, who was a reporter and columnist at the Cleveland 'Plain Dealer'. This very readable book tells about the commercial rivalry between the \\"Sheppard clan\\" osteopaths and the allopaths who controlled Cleveland's hospitals. The Sheppard's suburban hospital performed therapeutic abortions, considered as murder to many in Cleveland (p.37). <br /> <br />Part 1 tells of the crime, trial, and conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard. The county coroner disliked the \\"Sheppard clan\\", Dr. Sam was the suspect from the first day (p.16). Marilyn had fought her attacker, she had 15 lacerations on her head and 35 wounds overall (p.18). Important evidence was lost by mistake (p.19). Dr. Sam had physical injuries from a powerful blow to the back of his head (pp.28-29). Dr. Sam's rescue vehicle for car accidents in 1953 had irked the medical establishment (pp.36-37). Stories were leaked to the press to make Dr. Sam appear guilty (pp.39-40). Dr. Sam's family all backed Marilyn when there were problems in their marriage. Dr. Sam had been copying the permissive life style of the rich and famous in Los Angeles (p.48), but Marilyn tolerated Sam's affairs (p.65). There was a trail of blood drops from the kitchen to the cellar, Dr. Sam had no wounds. They was never tested by Mary Cowan, the co-worker and close friend of Coroner Dr. Gerber. People's minds were made up by the stories in the press (p.71). There was no forensic evidence to tie Dr. Sam to the crime (p.91). Possible evidence for an intruder was neglected (p.95)! The local press and court system were convinced of Dr. Sam's guilt (p.127). The prosecutor used Dr. Sam's adulteries as a motive for murder (p.133). The coroner testified that a \\"surgical instrument\\" was the murder weapon but there was no factual basis for this claim (pp.142-144). After many days the jury decided on murder second degree (p.166). <br /> <br />Part 2 tells of the appeals to reverse the conviction. Defense lawyer William Corrigan hired Dr. Paul Kirk, the \\"founding father of criminalistics\\" (p.174). The prosecution concealed evidence that suggested an intruder (p.175). Kirk found evidence to support Dr. Sam's story (pp.179-184). Coroner Gerber used his political connections to damage Kirk (p.187). The flashlight murder weapon was found in the lake, then neglected by the coroner (p.190). Chapter 22 tells of Richard Eberling's early life. In 1961 Paul Holmes published his book which presented Kirk's findings. Dr. Steve Sheppard was introduced to Francis Lee Bailey, who sued to get Dr. Sam's conviction overturned (Chapter 26). Bailey believed he could win an acquittal (p.242). The Supreme Court overturned the conviction. The retrial resulted in a 'not guilty' verdict because of the blood spatter evidence and the testimony for a third person's blood (p.281); there was reasonable doubt. But Dr. Sam's victory was followed by personal defeats. His surgical skills deteriorated; he also drank. Ariane divorced him, Dr. Sam became a professional wrestler (p.287). His drinking continued until he died of a liver disease (p.289). Chapter 32 tells of the career of Richard Eberling and Oscar B. Henderson. They gained power and influence under one Cleveland mayor. An elderly woman where Eberling lived died form an accident, a fracture like Dr. Sam's (pp.299-300). Later Eberling got a life sentence for murder, forgery, theft, and related crimes (pp.305-306).  <br /> <br />Part 3 tells of Neff's investigations. Marilyn's death did not fit the usual profile (p.333). Kirk's old files were found, the blood sample pointed to Eberling, but not uniquely (p.336) Neff explains the \\"hard facts\\" why Dr. Sam did not kill Marilyn (Epilogue).

R. Rule, Major USAF, who studied law, then specialized in the field of legal medicine, as it applies to the military. He is currently Legal Counsel for the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. The Armed Forces have developed a nearly perfect system for the administration of justice.    Della Street tells Perry Mason a young woman, Dorrie Ambler, has come to establish her personal identification through an appendectomy scar. Perry suggests fingerprints would be better. Dorrie is afraid of becoming a victim of a frame-up! She has been given clothes to wear, even shoes and underwear; but she won't explain. Perry has her followed when she leaves. Dorrie goes to the airport, and does the craziest thing you could imagine (Chapter 2)! The police show up and arrest the woman who came out of the rest room. This is one goofy case or client. The five o'clock news tells of the event at the airport and that Minerva Minden, the madcap heiress of Montrose, has been arrested for her pranks.    Then Dorrie Ambler shows up, and tells about the job she was hired to do. [Anyone remember \\"The Red-Headed League\\"?] A lot of personal questions were asked to qualify for this high-paying job. Dorrie had to wear a complete outfit and walk at an intersection. Dorrie tells Mason how she identified the detective agency that gave her instructions. When she went there to learn more, she saw her double waiting there for her car. Dorrie got the license number of her double's car (Chapter 3). Because she was afraid of being used for a sinister purpose, Dorrie staged that scene at the airport. Perry figures out why Dorrie was hired, and how she is being used.    In Chapter 4 the trickery employed results in the police apparently waiting to arrest Dorrie Ambler for a crime she didn't commit! Perry Mason and Paul Drake come right over on this \\"red-hot lead\\". But the door is locked, and a woman screams. They break in to find a body onthe floor, so they call the police. The police find a stolen car that was involved in a hit-and-run in Dorrie's garage (Chapter 5). Can a case be fixed by selecting the judge, and then a lawyer who is a good friend (Chapter 6)? Is Dorrie involved in a crooked scheme that if financed by a Las Vegas businessman (Chapter 7)? Is Dorrie an innocent victim or did she inveigle Perry into her scheme (Chapter 9)?    Chapter 10 has a shocking surprise. Minerva Minden was taken in for questioning by the police. She will be charged with a double murder. Perry warns Minerva against her \\"madcap heiress\\" reputation. People are convicted of murder on evidence that only shows guilt of adultery (Chapter 11). [Is this a reference to the Dr. Sam Sheppard case?] The trial begins in Chapter 12. The prosecution brings out new facts against Minerva, which fills in unknown details in this case. The witnesses give their testimony. One witness has a shocking story to tell! This is the most important chapter. Perry Mason tells Paul Drake to get a quick report on all unsolved stick-ups. Perry has only one chance for a not guilty verdict (Chapter 13). Chapter 14 has the testimony of Lt. Tragg on the thumb prints, and another shocking discovery! The judge orders a directed verdict of 'not guilty' after the conflicting stories are resolved (Chapter 15). The loose ends are tied up in the last chapter. The ending is different from many other stories. [Gardner managed to ridicule both eyewitness and circumstantial evidence in this story.]	2005-09-07

Sybil doesn't want a divorce, she just wants her husband back. Sybil wants Perry to buy stock in a real estate development company to create difficulties that will affect Enright's affair with Mrs. Roxy Claffin. Perry buys the stock from George Lutts, paying $32,750 for 2,000 shares, and learns more about this property in a run-down residential district. Roxy owns the adjoining property. Sybil tells Perry the new freeway will increase the worth of this property. They drive to the old mansion (partitioned for small businesses). They observe Roxy by her swimming pool. Perry attends the director's meeting, and says Roxy has invaded their \\"right of lateral support\\" by removing fill dirt and could be sued. Late in the afternoon Perry gets an emotional phone call from Sybil; when she was at the old house with George Lutts someone shot him! Earlier Lutts bought 3,000 shares of the stock for $24,000 from another director. Sybil tells all at Perry's office, the gun in Sybil's car is now missing! Perry gives specific instructions to Sybil. Paul Drake monitors taxicabs by their radio frequency. Sybil tells Perry she followed his advice. Perry calls Herbert Doxey and asks to inspect the property. They find Lutts' car and the body. Sergeant Holcomb suspects something from Perry's presence. Roxy's problems and complaints to Enright have sent him back to Sybil. Paul tells Perry the police found the murder weapon; it was sold to Enright A. Harlan! The taxidriver picked up a woman near the murder scene, another taxidriver brought the woman to Harlan's home. Perry visits Sybil in jail. Perry assigns his detectives to get information on the other people who are involved. The preliminary hearing gives the details about the death. [Did you notice anything?] The taxidriver's testimony is contradicted by the printed receipt! We learn some woman other than the defendant signed to buy the murder weapon. The case is dismissed and Sybil is released from custody. Perry and Della perform an experiment on the testimony. The District Attorney presents new evidence at the trial. Perry finds out that Sybil didn't tell him the whole truth, she explains why. Sybil's friend is called as a prosecution witness, as are others. Roxy threw out junk like boards and torn canvas sacks at the dump. Other witnesses are questioned. The questioning of Enright Harlan uncovers a surprising fact! A new witness admits to facts that point to another person. Perry explains his observations just before the judge instructs the jury to return a verdict of not guilty for Sybil.	2005-09-07

Myers, M.D. a specialist in forensic pathology. This specialty can keep the guilty from escaping justice or the innocent from being wrongly convicted. These seekers after truth are different from the partisan expert witnesses who testify for one side [but are needed for checks and balances]. Gardner says these experts are relatively underpaid.   The opening of this novel is a change from the usual style. Sue Fisher came in to work Saturday morning to finish typing a report. Her manager's son and governess came by; Carleton Campbell is dropped off so Elizabeth Dow can run a personal errand. Sue gets a call from Amelia Corning, who is at the airport and demands help; she will make a personal check on the business she owns. Corning is dissatisfied with what she hears, and send Sue out to buy luggage so Corning can take papers to her hotel for inspection. Later, when Sue reaches Endicott Campbell to tell him what happened, Endicott says Sue must be crazy or lying. Sue hangs up and calls Perry Mason. Endicott calls back and demands Sue meet him at Amelia Corning's hotel. Perry tells Sue she should have had a witness to verify the cash found in that shoe box to forestall any possible claims. When they all show up for the 8:45 meeting they find that Amelia Corning has left the hotel, and just disappeared into thin air with the company records!   Then another Amelia Corning shows up. Forewarned, Perry Mason meets her at the hotel. Can anybody judge a person by the sound of their voice (Chapter 4)? The auditors found over $160,000 missing, and heavy losses at their Mojave Monarch mine. Perry and Della visit this mine to talk to Ken Lowry, the manager of this mine. They find he was hired by mail, and received instructions on the telephone from someone he's never met. Lowry sent in monthly figures as if the mine was still in operation. The payroll check would be cashed and most of it sent backin a secretive manner! It was peculiar (Chapter 6).   Amelia Corning calls Perry for a meeting - but Amelia disappears! When Perry and Della visit Sue Fisher, she isn't there. When she returns, Sue tells of the order she received over the phone. When Perry and Della visit the place where Sue parked, they find a body and the missing records! Perry calls Lt. Tragg to report the body, then continues his investigation into this case. The dialogue tells of the efforts. Sue Fisher is arrested as a suspect in the murder; she fit the description. Chapter 11 begins the Preliminary Hearing. The testimony of Mrs. Jackson shows how a &#34;maybe&#34; gets turned into positive identification.   Perry gets information from Paul Drake about a lady friend of Endicott Campbell, and asks for a recess. Perry quickly investigates this person, and solves this riddle to free his client. Perry, as a veteran trial lawyer, had a good idea who was telling the truth; and this led to the person who was lying, and guilty. Note Gardner's illustration of the fact that a rented car will have the fingerprints of prior users.

Brooks' background is in engineering, not programming. His observations are personal opinion, not Absolute Truth. Those who are impressed with this book appear to have little practical experience. Woe to any programmer who disputes his manager because 'Brooks says so'!     This 20th anniversary edition reminds me of an old computer program that has been modified to meet new needs. Chapter 16 through 19 have been added, as if there was no need for any other changes in the earlier chapters. But many of the examples in the earlier chapters became obsolete with virtual programming, faster machines, and bigger memories. The programmers of that Golden Age are now on the beach or have gone underground. The new era of Windows and Intel, with offshore jobs, have turned mainframe programmers into a new version of 19th century whalers and buffalo hunters. As I understand it, the problems of OS/360 were due to: a new machine architecture, a new assembler language, and new people with less experience. In time these problems were overcome. Some might compare the effort to the Union Army in 1861-62,    Chapter 16 speaks of the folklore nightmares of werewolves! Is he kidding? Brooks needs to see \\"Abbot & Costello Meet Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman\\" to update his knowledge. Software costs have dropped rapidly, as the price for Windows 2000 shows. Brooks confuses mass-production with custom work. You can compare stick-built houses to modular houses, more common outside the USA they say. Software entities are complex because they use general purpose programming languages. A specific purpose language should be less complex. Another advantage of a high-level language is fewer typed characters, and hence fewer typing mistakes that can't be found by a compiler. The advantage to time-sharing is to cut delays, it also makes programming more intensive. The rest of the chapter, pages 188-203 can be skipped. There is a \\"silver bullet\\": offshore programming where programmers are rented for $30 a day compared to $50 an hour state-side. Cottage weavers were eliminated by factory production, and whaling ships by kerosene production.     Chapter 17 has Brooks' comments on replies to his \\"no silver bullet\\" concept. A silver bullet is an alleged particular solution to a specific problem. Did anyone do a field test for this solution? Perhaps a better symbol is needed? Chapter 18 regurgitates the original book in outline form with Brooks' added comments. Did you find this educational?    Chapter 19 asks about the appeal of MM-M. Perhaps it is due to its counter-intuitive claim that adding more labor to a process makes it take longer? Would removing labor from a process make it finish earlier? More new people who don't have experience reduces the average level of knowledge needed for the job. Usually more people means the job is done earlier, as in barn-raising. Talk of a \\"second system\\" implies more experience. Brooks failure to understand this suggests some personal problem. The prevention of \\"featuritis\\" is accomplished by following the needs of users according to priority. Brooks admits his advice \\"to throw one away\\" is wrong (p.265). Page 266 tells of the problem is listening to unproven fantasies. Brooks' comments on \\"fluidity\\" (p.280) seems oriented to entertainment not production (\\"slide presentations\\") The coalescence of operating systems seems similar to automotive manufacturing (who remembers marque-specific engines?) Is \\"software engineering\\" an a priori fantasy? Other engineering creates rules for mass-production (p.286). Programming practice should be concerned with the rules for efficient creation of programs. There is a picture of Brooks on page 228, another on page i. Do you see what I see? What is the usefulness of this book?    [Novice programmers may find Scott Adams' \\"Dilbert Principle\\" better for today's world.]	2005-08-31

This car was stolen earlier that day, but quickly found by the police. Perry starts his investigation. Perry and Della find a black sedan which has been in a recent accident. This owner confesses to the hit-and-run, and writes out a large check for the injured youth. Could there be two guilty parties to the same crime? They find the body of the chauffeur shot dead!

The police quickly find the missing witnesses, they are wire-tapping Drake's telephone as well as Mason's! When court resumes Perry cross-examines a prosecution witness to reveal the truth. Perry says any iron-clad alibi in a murder case should be inspected closely as they can't be taken at their face value.  \\"The Case of the Cautious Coquette\\" (1949) begins when Perry Mason, a lawyer in a hit-and-run accident, posts an advertisement for any witness who can identify the speeding black sedan. He receives an anonymous typed letter with an address and a key. It appears to be a trap; a young woman disavows all knowledge of the accident. Her stationary and typewriter match the anonymous letter. Perry returns to find a license number in a notebook, and traces it. This car has recent repairs and repainting. This car was stolen earlier that day, but quickly found by the police. Perry starts his investigation. Perry and Della find a black sedan which has been in a recent accident. This owner confesses to the hit-and-run, and writes out a large check for the injured youth. Could there be two guilty parties to the same crime? They find the body of the chauffeur shot dead! The police figured out the shooting was a murder. They traced the gun even after its serial number was removed. Is Perry Mason in over his head? Can he save his client as well as himself? This story has the early version of Perry Mason, part private detective, who sometimes acts just within the letter of the law. The Preliminary Hearing puts the various witnesses on the stand for questioning. There is a recess in the hearing. Perry Mason and Lt. Tragg drive to a residence, they see a witness take off. The story ends with Perry Mason's client being freed.	2005-08-30

Gardner wrote the \\"Perry Mason\\" novels from 1933 to 1970, and other works. Gardner, and others, formed \\"The Court of Last Resort\\" in the 1940s to investigate the wrongfully convicted. The background of the stories tell of the era. Gardner never put dates in his novels, but the monetary figures date these stories.<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Rolling Bones\\" (1939) begins when three people visit Perry Mason. Phyllis Leeds is the niece and secretary of Alden Leeds. Emily Milicant is the girlfriend of Alden Leeds. Ned Barkler is a friend of Alden Leeds and a fellow Klondike prospector. Phyllis Leeds thinks Uncle Alden wrote a big check that could be used to declare Alden incompetent by relatives who want to get his fortune. They want Perry Mason to investigate this financial transaction. Paul Drake found the name of the girl who cashed that check, but she left town in a hurry. Drake traced Marcia Whittaker to L. C. Conway, who also moved away. Phyllis Leeds tells a relative has taken Uncle Alden for a ride and put him in a sanitarium! Perry will serve a writ of habeas corpus on this nephew. Perry and Paul talk to Marcia Whittaker who cashed that big check. There is a habeas corpus hearing, Alden Leeds was hospitalized against his will. Judge Treadwell goes to make a personal examination but they find Alden Leeds has fled! Emily Milicant had been a Klondike dance hall girl. Alden Leeds isn't at home but knows how to take care of himself. Drake's operatives are watching Conway's apartment, they note who showed up and the time they left. Perry gets a call from Marcia Whittaker, and the identity of Conway is revealed. Her boyfriend, John Milicant, will never be angry again. We learn the facts behind the murder and the backgrounds of the people. A handwriting expert gives his opinion on two samples. Perry's conversation with Guy T. Serle brings out facts about Conway and the events of that night. We learn the Klondike history of Alden Leeds and Bill Hogarty. Perry moves fast to guard his client and obtain more information. The preliminary hearing has the witnesses testify. There is a recess, and Perry Mason gathers more information about the murder and the events that occurred in the Klondike.

Perry says any iron-clad alibi in a murder case should be inspected closely since they should never be taken at their face value.<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Silent Partner\\" (1940) begins when Mildreth Faulkner calls Perry Mason for an appointment. She owns a small flower shop. A competitor, Harry Peavis, bought up a few shares in her small corporation. Now he wants to buy control. She visits her invalid sister Carlotta and her husband Bob. A nightclub with a PRIVATE door runs a racket. The witness, Esther Dilmeyer, is poisoned by candy but is found in time. Mildreth suspects Bob has given up Carlotta's shares in the corporation. Mason visits the nightclub owner's cabin, only to find the police and newspaper reporters covering his murder. Lynk was dead for a while (the coagulation of blood and rigor mortis). Was it someone from the list of suspects, or an as yet unknown person? A suspect could refuse to answer questions based on constitutional rights. Lieutenant Tragg plays with Mildreth like a cat with a mouse, and gets her admission (Mason represents her sister Carlotta). Mason points out that husbands and wives are more likely to kill each other than a stranger. A claimant in a court of equity must have clean hands; illegal means, entrapment, fraud, or oppression disqualify a suit. Mason learns of facts that lead to the questioning of a witness, and the truth comes out to free his client. Mildrethrecovers the missing stock and keeps her business.	2005-08-30

The table of contents lists the 25 chapters, and the index. It covers many historical events from the Neanderthals, Stonehenge, and the legend of Theseus , to Freud, the `Titanic' and the Romanov dynasty. Reporters show up after an event, and reconstruct it from eyewitness accounts. Historians perform similar actions. So read these stories and be entertained. Each chapter has references for more information.<br /><br />Chapter 1 discusses the relationship between Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon humans. Varied theories conflict, and show that scientific belief is as constant as a weathervane. Chapter 2 explains the controversy about Stonehenge. If it was built to record the times of the year, Gerald Hawkins' book explains his findings. If the pyramids were built as tombs for the pharaohs, why do they lack a body (Chapter 3)? The different accounts of the four Gospels is typical of eyewitness accounts when there is no collusion to get their stories straight (Chapter 6). Using the Nazca lines to record the solstices of the year makes sense (Chapter 7). Extra lines could have been added to conceal the secret. Chapter 9 asks why the Mayan civilization collapsed leaving no traces of a disaster. It seemed due to \\"endemic warfare\\", drought, and disease.<br /><br />What \\"sign\\" was given to the Dauphin by Joan of Arc (Chapter 11)? Joan was condemned in 1431, but posthumously rehabilitated in 1456. There is no mention of Giles de Rais (\\"Bluebeard\\") and his sponsorship of Joan. Could some magic trick have impressed Charles and then raised the morale of the French troops? Chapter 13 discusses Richard III, the last Plantagenet. [Is he missing the tips of two fingers in that portrait?] If he murdered the two Princes in the Tower that would follow the royal habits of those times. Chapter 14 discusses whether Columbus expected to discover a New World. Aristotle and Seneca discussed sailing west to the Indies. Chapter 15 teaches the unreliability of eyewitness identification, even in a small town. Chapter 16 tells of the Casket Letters, an example of forgery for political purposes. But Mary Queen of Scots wasn't fit for the throne (her bad judgment). Chapter 17 considers whether the little known owner of a theater company was the true author of all those famous plays. It shows how those with a point of view can find evidence for their positions. Was Captain Kidd a pirate or a political pawn (Chapter 18)?<br /><br />Chapter 19 discusses Mozart's death and his `Requiem'. The movie `Amadeus' was Hollywood History. Chapter 20 tells of the faulty basis for Freud's \\"science of psychoanalysis\\". Did Freud invent the memories recovered from his patients (p.164)? Is the popularization of Freud's theory meant to distract from the science of Pavlov? Chapter 21 asks if the `Titanic' could have been saved if it didn't speed through the ice field. Why didn't they have enough lifeboats? Blame was given to the captain of the `Californian' for not going to the `Titanic', even though it would have been too late. Chapter 22 explains why none of the Romanovs survived. Chapter 23 tells of a young woman found shot in her uncle's home with her uncle's pistol. Was it suicide? Her uncle's alibi was a speeding ticket, but there were rumors about their relationship, and the uncle's strange sex life. Did this affect the uncle? Chapter 24 discusses Rudolf Hess's surprise flight to Scotland. Most likely the British Secret Service lured Hess to embarrass Hitler, just weeks before Hitler attacked Russia. Chapter 25 discusses the August 1991 attempted coup in Moscow and what Gorbachev did or didn't do. Did Gorbachev stand aside and plan to profit from the success or failure of this coup?	2005-08-29

Timothy Treadwell's fantasy earned him the scorn of hunters, the skepticism of naturalists, and the adoration of some animal lovers. [Does \\"animal lover\\" signify a neurotic person? You can decide based on their opinions.] This book is sort of like a true-crime story, except the perpetrators were animals, not humans. The victims were Timothy Treadwell and Amie Huguenard. Their killers had no names. Both victims ignored all advice and standard protocols followed by the scientific community (p.55). Was Treadwell motivated solely by ambition and publicity (p.39)? Did he lack any scientific background (p.57)? Bears aren't \\"people in furry suits\\" (p.55). [Actually, they are similar. Just as most people won't bother you if you don't bother them, there will always be rogues who will look for a victim.]    The Katmai Coast has world-class trophies, male bears weighing up to 1,500 pounds. They are the closest thing to a pre-historic cave bear in today's world. Treadwell was advised to show restraint and take basic precautions, for the bears' sake as well as his own (p.41). Any bear that kills a human is hunted down; likely suspects are killed until the right one is found.    What to do in case of a bear attack? A slug-loaded Remington model 870 12-gauge pump shotgun with rifle sights is recommended protection (pp.246-247). It is best to avoid any dangerous situation in the first place. [Just as with humans!] Would you like to try \\"Counter Assault\\" against a charging bear (p.247). You could also use a 12-gauge flare gun to scare away a bear (p.249). But what if there is more than one? Decades ago I used to read that man-eating lions or tigers were too old or crippled to catch their usual prey. Would that explain this attack? Note that bears, like other animals, are cannibals.    Brown bears have the speed of a horse, the power of an ox, and theintelligence that can rival humans. They have a record of killing and eating humans (p.220). But there is no one place that records all attacks in the United States! The danger from the smaller black bear is much lower, but still present. Most black bears flee from humans, evolution or acquired characteristics (p.227). But when they do attack, it is to kill for food (p.228); they are driven by hunger (p.229). That old rule about \\"playing dead\\" will turn a person into bear food (p.231)! Bears attack when they feel stressed by their environment - other bears, drought, hunger, etc. (p.232). An intruder is viewed as competition for their food supply (p.233). Some bears have learned that a gunshot is like a dinner bell calling them for foot from hunting leftovers (p.234). Nick Jans has two theories on bear attacks (pp.235-236). Bears attack out of sheer irritation or temperament; the reasons are \\"unknown\\". It could be brain damage (parasites?) or even mental illness (diagnosed in pet dogs). As with shark attacks, there is safety in numbers (p.238). The advice here should be read by anyone who would travel in bear country (pp.239-250). Electric perimeter fencing works 100% of the time.    The Bibliograpy has a list of published books. They will probably not be found in your local library or bookstore.	2005-08-24

It seems to be that serial killers are most feasible in large cities where there are a lot of transients and other opportunities (Cleveland's Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run). Such things could never happen in a small town with only a few thousand people, like in rural Kansas. Or could it?    The various cases mostly happened in the 1960s, when Ann Rule was younger and more likely affected by their reports. These stories show Rule's narrative style and were originally written for magazines. Each is self-contained and are not consistent as to background. They all originate from love (or lust), or a desire for money. The love of money is still the root of evil. Do the rich murder for love or lust, or is that just another sign of poverty?

His research on an unknown dead woman led to her recognition, and the to the man who killed her.     This story begins with a new client, Horace Warren, who wants Perry Mason to attend a dinner and observe a person to judge his character. There is discussion of fingerprint identification. Warren wants his wife Lorna protected from a blackmailer; her past is a mystery (Chapter 1). Perry and Della join other guests at this dinner party, and are introduced (Chapter 3). [Is this 'hiding in plain sight'?] The fingerprints of the guests are recorded and checked out. They find one person had been arrested, but acquitted; it is Lorna Warren (she had worked for a man convicted of fraud). The police are interested in Collister Damon Gideon because they believe he has hidden funds. Smooth-talking Gideon shows up at Perry?s office, he knows about Lorna (Chapter 6). [This also explains how agents shadow a person of interest.] Gideon wants a 'donation' to help him disappear. But Perry has some trump cards he can use against Gideon (Chapter 7). Perry baits a hook to catch Gideon (Chapter 8). But Gideon disappears while being followed by six operatives (Chapter 9)! Perry's plan to scare Gideon away develops a flaw (Chapter 10). But Perry thinks of a sure-fire scheme to thwart this blackmailer (Chapter 11). But there is a surprise here when Lt. Tragg arrests Perry's client for Gideon's murder (Chapter 12). Now Horace Warren comes clean and tells all to Perry after he's arrested (Chapter 14). The police go to question Mrs. Warren, but Perry got there first and tells her to answer \\"no comment\\" (Chapter 15).     Perry's scheme to scare Gideon away appears to back-fire (Chapter 16). District Attorney Hamilton Burger will complain to the Bar Association (Chapter 17). Perry finds out what happened to the fortune in the suitcase in Lorna's closet (Chapter 18). If both Horace and Lorna deny shooting Gideon, then who did? Chapter 19 discusses the recurring theme about the unreliability of eyewitness identification of a stranger viewed for a few seconds under stress. Perry may be charged with witness tampering for having a private detective question witnesses with the sketch of Gideon. One problem is the incomplete search of the crime scene. Then new evidence is found with a second search, but this crime scene had not been guarded (Chapter 20). The effect of this new evidence is the dismissal of the murder charge against Horace Warren (Chapter 21).     In the last chapter, as in other cases, Perry Mason provides a solution to the mysteries. The past of Mrs. Warren is kept secret. Any person could make deposits to an account that wasn't theirs in those days. Perry deduces the solution from the facts given in earlier chapters. [I did wonder about that strange event after the hold-up.] I couldn't put this book down!	2005-08-23
95438:US	38002140	RN6BRK17K4TPJ	0380709872	241419676	Torso: Eliot Ness and the Hunt for the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run a True Story	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Cleveland's "Jack the Ripper"	In the 1930s over a dozen murders were attributed to the \\"Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run\\", a ravine that runs through Cleveland Ohio and contains this stream and railroad yards. Most of these bodies were unidentified: headless, the arms, legs, and torso were cut up by someone who knew anatomy or butchering. It was never solved, altho one suspect was made to confess, repudiated this confession, and then found a suicide in jail. Such serial murders were rare in America; earlier serial murderers did it for money and left this trail. No motive was ever established for these murders. Most sex murderers are the product of large cities, which have anonymous victims or perpetrators. Chapter Eleven summarizes these cases.  <br /> <br />This book is about the later career of Eliot Ness. After Chicago, he was put in charge of the Alcoholic Tax Unit of norther Ohio. He cleaned out bootleggers, hitting a still every day. Organized crime made Cleveland a safe haven for criminals on the run. Corruption had spread everywhere; neighborhood crime had greatly increased. Harold Burton became mayor, and chose Eliot Ness as Director of Public Safety to oversee the police and firemen. (Burton later became a Senator, a friend of Truman, and was appointed to the Supreme Court.) The ineffectiveness of the police was due to widespread corruption and complacency. With Prohibition gone, Ness prosecuted gambling and union racketeering. Ness cultivated a good relationship with reporters, and got favorable publicity. He tried to purge corrupt policemen but was met with silence. Then a police captain was caught in a cemetery lot racket. Another owned a restaurant which fronted for a gambling room. The bodies found in Kingsbury Run highlighted the corruption.  <br /> <br />Cleveland had been the worst city (after Los Angeles) for traffic deaths and injuries. Ness purged the traffic division, began arresting drunk drivers, prosecuted ticket fixing, gave harsher penalties for unpaid fines, and started tougher automobile inspections. Ness promoted traffic safety with a public awareness campaign. He began an Emergency Patrol with first aid training to reach any accident within two minutes. This cut traffic deaths by half, and he received national recognition. Some of the increased traffic fines were put back into the police budget. Squad cars now had two-way radios. A single phone call brought police assistance within 60 seconds. Ness was criticized for wasting tax dollars, but in one year overall crime dropped 38%, robberies by 50%! Public success was followed by private problems: divorce, late night socializing, stories of drinking.  <br /> <br />Ness later resigned to join the Federal Social Protection Program during WW 2. Afterwards, he became a businessman but was not successful. His campaign for Mayor of Cleveland flopped. He later met Oscar Fraley and began to write his book. Just before its publication, Ness died of a heart attack; he never knew of its success. <br />	2005-08-23

Hiss was found guilty of perjury in denying he knew Whittaker Chambers and handed over secret documents. Chambers had documents typed on the Hiss typewriter, documents written by Hiss, and photographs of secret documents. Could Chambers have been wicked enough to lie and incriminate Hiss? What corroboration was there? Jowitt said only the typewritten documents were self-corroborating since handwritten documents could be acquired by theft (p.17). Given the technique of photographing documents to copy them, the retyping of a document is remarkable! People forget minor details after 9 or 10 years, but would not forget if they paid Communist Party dues then (pp.19-20). So either Alger, Priscilla, and Donald were lying when they denied it, or Whittaker Chambers was lying when he said he collected their dues. Since Donald Hiss’s denial was never challenged in court, then Chambers lied about this. Chambers first swore there was no espionage; then after Nov 17, 1948 he changed his story. Was Chambers lying before or afterward?   Could Alger Hiss have sued W. Chambers for libel if he was in fact guilty (p.21)? Unlikely, but not impossible. Jowitt notes that the date for document turn over was picked as April 1938 so the statute of limitations was passed (p.25)! In 1939 Chambers accused Alger Hiss of being a Communist, but the Assistant Secretary for Internal Security did nothing (p.27)! Similar charges were made in 1945 and 1946 with no action taken. [Could Alger Hiss have been a double agent, as in his actions with the AAA?] Chambers would neither deny or admit to using the name “George Crosley” (p.28). This is remarkable given his other feats of memory. Jowitt questions Hiss’s guilt given the fact that this typewriter was not destroyed (p.31). Chambers abandoned his typewriter (p.272).   Chapter 3 gives Jowitt’s opinions of Chambers based on the recently published book “Witness”. He distrusts Chambers because of his passionate emotions (p.47). Chambers loved drama, sensationalism, and publicity (p.48). Chambers claimed he returned documents to Hiss about 1 AM (p.53). Did he drive or take a taxi? Chambers denied any espionage until the libel suit (p.57). Chapter 5 tells of Alger Hiss’s career, he rose to a high position (p.64). [Usually these jobs are reserved to the very rich.] Jowitt says Hiss must have been checked before becoming president of the Carnegie Endowment. [Were Hiss’s troubles caused by political differences?] Note that Chambers said in 1939 Mrs. Hiss was a Socialist, but in 1948 he said she was a Communist (p.77)! Jowitt notes the details of the alleged $400 loan (p.100). Chambers quit the Communists in late 1937 “as a result of the purge activities” (p.130). [Could Chambers have been a double agent?]      Jowitt thinks they should have investigated how the handwritten documents from Hiss and White got into Chambers’ possession (p.148). Chambers claimed he saved documents as a “life preserver”, but also he had completely forgotten their existence (p.182)! Contradictory? Or an example of drama? Could the documents have preserved his life when he wasn’t around to corroborate them? Jowitt and others did not know then that typewritten documents could be forged by experienced forgers (Chapter XXVII). Giving copies of the documents to the jury would be biased since they had no experience examining documents and could not use magnifiers to inspect the typing (p.322). Chapter XXXIV has Jowitt’s doubts about the verdict after the publication of “Witness”. Jowitt notes that Chambers never accused other members of the group of committing espionage (p.340)! Documents typed on the Hiss typewriter were needed to indict and convict (p.343). Most important of all, who produced the incriminating documents (p.344)?   If the copies weremade in 1938 there must have been wear on the typefaces so they would not match the typewriting made in 1948. Also, the condition of the typewriter went from old and worn to perfect operating order in 1948.	2005-08-22

They had two novels combined in one paperback at a bargain price. Erle Stanley Gardner was \\"the World's Greatest Author\\" in his time, his novels outsold the combined totals of his rivals. Gardner wrote the \\"Perry Mason\\" novels from 1933 to 1970, and other works. Gardner, and others, formed \\"The Court of Last Resort\\" in the 1940s to investigate the wrongfully convicted. The background of the stories tell of the era. Gardner never put dates in his novels, but the monetary figures date these stories.<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Stepdaughter's Secret\\" (1963) begins when Perry Mason and Della Street await a visit from Harlow Bancroft, a wealthy industrialist. His secret past could embarrass him, he has a letter from a blackmailer. Perry offers advice, and a plan to foil the blackmailer. Paul Drake and his operatives will effect Perry's plan for the money. This plan works, but there is a glitch. More complications arise. Bancroft's step-daughter Rosena Andrews also has a secret that she wants kept hidden. One person has a connection to a blackmailer. A blackmailer meets Mrs. Bancroft on their yacht, a gun is fired, a body goes into the water. Now Perry has a difficult case on his hands. This story has advice on handling blackmail that is still valid. The police find the missing yacht, and the body. The Bancrofts keep their lips zipped until their attorney is present. The rest of the book explains how Perry deals with the red-hot potato dropped on his plate. It has the fast-paced twists and surprises expected in a Perry Mason case. It also tells of the hidden flaws in the lives of the rich. The convention is that a guilty person has done wrong earlier. But which one? This story has examples of the unreliability of an eye-witness when the testimony can't be corroborated.

Twenty years ago she won a beauty contest. Her hometown newspaper is looking to publish a story about her, she doesn't want publicity. Perry calls the newspaper's editor and orders him to kill this story because it would be an invasion of privacy after the event is no longer current news. The next day a private investigator calls on Perry; he is investigating this beauty contest winner. Perry devises a scheme to mislead and distract this man as he thinks something is wrong. Perry uses a decoy who resembles Perry's client. This draws out the inquiring investigator. Later Perry and Della meet Ellen Adair to get more. Another complex puzzle begins. Soon there's a dead body and the arrest of Ellen Adair. Evidence accumulates against her. This novel shows the changing morals of the times. The book shows why you should never lie to your lawyer. If there is a reasonable explanation for circumstantial evidence other than guilt, the jury must acquit if the case depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. Perry's client is exonerated, and may live happily ever after. But the ending seems to be tacked on. Circumstantial evidence is best only when it is correctly interpreted says Perry Mason.	2005-08-22
99075:US	38002140	R2413VW9NBO98V	B0006DB2YY	178751505	The Strange Case of Alger Hiss	Books	5	0	1	N	N	The Lord Chancellor Reviews the Case	The Strange Case of Alger Hiss   Earl Jowitt acquired the full transcript of the second trial of Alger Hiss, read the case and analyzed the evidence to write this book. Hiss was found guilty of perjury in denying he knew Whittaker Chambers and handed over secret documents. Chambers had documents typed on the Hiss typewriter, documents written by Hiss, and photographs of secret documents. Could Chambers have been wicked enough to lie and incriminate Hiss? What corroboration was there? Jowitt said only the typewritten documents were self-corroborating since handwritten documents could be acquired by theft (p.17). Given the technique of photographing documents to copy them, the retyping of a document is remarkable! People forget minor details after 9 or 10 years, but would not forget if they paid Communist Party dues then (pp.19-20). So either Alger, Priscilla, and Donald were lying when they denied it, or Whittaker Chambers was lying when he said he collected their dues. Since Donald Hiss’s denial was never challenged in court, then Chambers lied about this. Chambers first swore there was no espionage; then after Nov 17, 1948 he changed his story. Was Chambers lying before or afterward?   Could Alger Hiss have sued W. Chambers for libel if he was in fact guilty (p.21)? Unlikely, but not impossible. Jowitt notes that the date for document turn over was picked as April 1938 so the statute of limitations was passed (p.25)! In 1939 Chambers accused Alger Hiss of being a Communist, but the Assistant Secretary for Internal Security did nothing (p.27)! Similar charges were made in 1945 and 1946 with no action taken. [Could Alger Hiss have been a double agent, as in his actions with the AAA?] Chambers would neither deny or admit to using the name “George Crosley” (p.28). This is remarkable given his other feats of memory. Jowitt questions Hiss’s guilt given the fact that this typewriter was not destroyed (p.31). Chambers abandoned his typewriter (p.272).   Chapter 3 gives Jowitt’s opinions of Chambers based on the recently published book “Witness”. He distrusts Chambers because of his passionate emotions (p.47). Chambers loved drama, sensationalism, and publicity (p.48). Chambers claimed he returned documents to Hiss about 1 AM (p.53). Did he drive or take a taxi? Chambers denied any espionage until the libel suit (p.57). Chapter 5 tells of Alger Hiss’s career, he rose to a high position (p.64). [Usually these jobs are reserved to the very rich.] Jowitt says Hiss must have been checked before becoming president of the Carnegie Endowment. [Were Hiss’s troubles caused by political differences?] Note that Chambers said in 1939 Mrs. Hiss was a Socialist, but in 1948 he said she was a Communist (p.77)! Jowitt notes the details of the alleged $400 loan (p.100). Chambers quit the Communists in late 1937 “as a result of the purge activities” (p.130). [Could Chambers have been a double agent?]      Jowitt thinks they should have investigated how the handwritten documents from Hiss and White got into Chambers’ possession (p.148). Chambers claimed he saved documents as a “life preserver”, but also he had completely forgotten their existence (p.182)! Contradictory? Or an example of drama? Could the documents have preserved his life when he wasn’t around to corroborate them? Jowitt and others did not know then that typewritten documents could be forged by experienced forgers (Chapter XXVII). Giving copies of the documents to the jury would be biased since they had no experience examining documents and could not use magnifiers to inspect the typing (p.322). Chapter XXXIV has Jowitt’s doubts about the verdict after the publication of “Witness”. Jowitt notes that Chambers never accused other members of the group of committing espionage (p.340)! Documents typed on the Hiss typewriter were needed to indict and convict (p.343). Most important of all, who produced the incriminating documents (p.344)?   If the copies weremade in 1938 there must have been wear on the typefaces so they would not match the typewriting made in 1948. Also, the condition of the typewriter went from old and worn to perfect operating order in 1948.	2005-08-22

Felt's recollection of events was refreshed by FBI records, Senate and House reports, and the Nixon tapes. Neither personal malice nor selfish motivations colored his actions or judgment at any time in his career (p.12). After J. Edgar Hoover died Felt, the #2 man, stayed to help the new Acting Director (who had no experience with law enforcement but many years as a Nixon loyalist). Felt resents \\"political considerations\\" imposed on the FBI; yet politics created the Bureau of Investigations. Shouldn't he advocate placing the FBI under Civil Service, like the US Secret Service? When the Secret Service convicted a Senator and Congressman for the Teapot Dome scandal, Congress cut their budget; later FDR reassigned counter-intelligence from the SS to the FBI. FDR depended on J. Edgar Hoover to get reports on the personal life of FDR's friends and enemies. Hoover's gathering of \\"dirt\\" on Congressmen and others was a form of pre-emptive defense necessary to political life in America (p.207). <br /> <br />Felt says the actions of the FBI neutralized the threat of terrorism from Al Fatah, the Jewish Defense League, and the Weather Underground (p.13). Felt warns against any complacency since terrorism can return (p.14)! The following chapters tell of his career and the events that propelled him to the top of the FBI Pyramid. Felt gives his side on the \\"palace intrigue\\" and his disagreements with William C. Sullivan. [Sullivan was shot before he could testify to the House Select Committee that Investigated Assassinations.] New agents were assigned to four different Field offices in their first four years. There were financial and personal hardships in this (p.25). Felt's reports were terse, succinct, and relevant. This attracted favorable notice (p.27). As a novice in the Espionage Section he uncovered a Nazi spy that had been overlooked (p.32). Chapter 4 tells of hiscareer promotions, 1945-1958. Chapter 5 discusses the fallacy of life insurance weight charts, and the use of anonymous letters for revenge. Chapter 6 explains why errors had to found, and \\"carefully evaluated\\". Chapter 7 tells of Felt's skills in solving problems. Felt discusses the FBI's inactivities in the 1960s (pp.104-105); could Hoover have feared Congressional payback? About half the book concerns his last years from 1971 to 1978, and the events of those years. <br />  <br />In June 1971 Jack Anderson reported that an anti-trust case against ITT was settled for a $400,000 campaign contribution (p.166). [Was this a unique occurrence? Were charges brought against ITT to shake them down?] Felt's recollection of the Tytell typewriter is slyly inaccurate and shows his problem solving skills (p.171). Hoover's death shocked Felt, since there was no sign of ill health (p.179). Felt defends Hoover's use of FBI personnel at his house as needed for security purposes (p.204). [Note problem-solving skills!] As to leaking stories to Woodward & Bernstein, Felt says he didn't leak \\"anything to anybody\\" (p.225). Felt has a non-denial denial on page 226. [Anyone who says Felt absolutely denied being \\"Deep Throat\\" didn't read this closely.] Felt explains the \\"Official and Confidential Files\\" (pp.228-229). The reason for files on politicians was \\"to facilitate liaison\\" (p.233). [How clever!] Chapter 18 tells of their investigation into the Watergate burglary. Even J. Edgar Hoover couldn't have stopped them (pp.258-259). Chapter 19 gives Felt's account of the Wounded Knee incident. Chapter 20 tells why L. Patrick Gray was an \\"ineffective leader\\" (p.278). Felt's account of W. Chambers resignation is inaccurate (p.295). After disagreeing with Ruckelshaus' political ploys, Felt resigned (p.303). Later Ruckelshaus did the same (Saturday Night Massacre). Felt's refusal to testify against Patrick Gray led to his indictment for his investigation of the Weather Underground (Chapter 23).[Was that quote of T. Jefferson taken out of context (p.315)?] Did opposition to the Vietnam War really delay the final peace agreement (p.318)? In discussing militant organizations, Felt doesn't mention any part played by agents-provocateurs to create lawlessness (p.320). Felt explains his justification for \\"black bag jobs\\" (p.323). His prosecution was due to deceit and double-dealing by the Justice Dept. he said (p.343). <br /> <br />	2005-08-19

It will clear the misinformation most people get from popular entertainment. <br /> <br />The identities of those who threw the tea into the sea for the Boston Tea Party have been kept secret for over 230 years, and will never be revealed. Some were known, but the successful Revolution exempted them from prosecution. It was a criminal act done for commercial rivalry, to get rid of lower-priced competition. Paul Revere served as a courier to spread the news about the Boston Tea Party, the closing of Boston Harbor, and the increased guard for Fort William and Mary in Portsmouth NH (the local Sons of Liberty raided the depot for its powder, shot, and muskets). Revere then spied against the British troops in Boston until he was sent to warn the militia of Lexington and Concord. [You must read elsewhere about the Stamp Act and its oppressive taxation that caused the Revolution.] <br /> <br />\\"Tragedy of Errors\\" tells of the Battle of Bunker Hill (it was fought on Breed's Hill). The Americans had blockaded Boston from the land side. They defended against the larger British forces until they ran out of bullets and powder. \\"One Life, One Country\\" has the history of Nathan Hale reconstructed from the known factual data. \\"Merry Christmas, 1776\\" is about the American surprise attack at Trenton, a victory after a number of losses. \\"Summer Week End\\" tells of the Battle of Monmouth and Molly Pitcher, who worked a gun after her husband was wounded. <br /> <br />\\"The 1000 to 1 Shot\\" tells quite a bit about the attack on Fort Sumter, then outgunned and short of supplies. The evolution from an ironclad floating battery is obvious. \\"Sheridan's Now or Never\\" tells of Sheridan's ride from Winchester to Cedar Creek where he changed a near defeat into a victory. \\"The Damned Torpedoes\\" explains David Farragut's victory at Mobile Bay. It proved the advantages of power over sail, and ironclads over wooden ships. \\"Army Mystery Man\\" summarizes the military career of George Armstrong Custer, promoted from captain to brigadier general at age 23. He was 36 when be became the last general to die leading his men into battle, the first battle Custer ever lost. <br /> <br />\\"Remember the Maine\\" tells how a mistranslated message sent the 'Maine' to Havana. No one knows then or now what sunk the 'Maine'. \\"Messenger to Garcia\\" tells of the travels of Lt. Andrew Summers Rowan to the Cuban insurgent General Garcia and his return. \\"The Glory That Was Gussie's\\" tells of an attempt to land arms and ammunition for the Cuban insurgents. \\"Hobson's Second Choice\\" tells of the deliberate sinking of an old collier to block the entrance to Santiago Harbor. \\"The Charge up San Juan Hill\\" was the start and finish of the Spanish-American War. Out forces stumbled, but their enthusiasm led them to victory against the last outpost of Spanish colonialism. <br />	2005-08-18

This tax exempted 98% of the people, and was designed to work against an inherited money aristocracy. The estate tax was one of the most progressive part of the tax laws (p.3). The authors claim that support for repeal first came from various groups outside of Washington, and later used lobbyists and others in Washington. This was one battle in the war against progressive taxation on wealth and income. [The authors don’t relate this to the monopolization of the press and broadcast stations, and the propaganda programs that include some “talk radio” shows.] The authors say these groups want to kill progressive taxation not by one big battle, but by a thousand small battles (p.5). George W. Bush’s 2001 tax policies turned a large budget surplus into a great deficit. Manufacturing and jobs were destroyed as if hit by a neutron bomb. [After the 1776 Revolution the Law of Primogeniture was abolished and replaced by the Law of Division to split up large property holdings.]    The authors wonder why a tax that affects so few could be so successfully attacked. They must not listen to the paid propaganda from radio and elsewhere. It could also result from an exemption figure that was too low, given the relentless devaluation of the currency since 1964 (when coins were silver and the dollar was backed by gold). A million dollars is not what it was in 1963. Renaming the inheritance tax as the “death tax” make sit more threatening to people with fuzzy knowledge. The founding of America saw the law of primogeniture replace by the law of distribution so assets would be evenly distributed after death. There are no “property rights” per se, only living people can own property. The belongings of a dead person are distributed according to law and awill. Large inherited fortunes create an aristocracy, and this is inimical to a democratic society. Refer to American History before 1877. Inheritance in a legal privilege, not a natural right, when it comes to large fortunes. The republican ideal was to split up large fortunes so each could benefit from their work. In 1889 Andrew Carnegie argued for a death tax because giving great fortunes to children was a danger to them (p.233). Page 234 provides some examples.   The authors claim that the increasing number of people who own stocks made them believe they would be affected by the inheritance tax. Maybe it is more true that the $675,000 exemption was decades out of date. [Isn’t that the cost of middle class housing in parts of the country?] That proposed raise in the exemption was too little, too late, and confirmed the idea of its wrongness (p.9). The organized coalition for repeal was not halted by assumption about the status quo. [This recalls Machiavelli’s comments on the difficulty of changing laws when a well organized group works actively while the opposition is disorganized.] The purpose of the estate tax was to break up large holdings, like those middle class businesses (e.g. “20 gas stations”) so the many could profit from their own work, and not create a class of the idle rich. One problem with the estate tax is that it doesn’t apply to corporations. Vigorous anti trust actions is needed to break up the mergers and acquisitions effected since 1980. Its never too late to correct these mistakes.   This analysis should teach us to understand politics. The next battle will be to create an oppressive national sales tax (the so called “value added tax”) that will recreate the high unemployment and economic malaise found in western Europe today. Or the so called “Fair Tax” that will lower income taxes for the super rich by raising taxes for working Americans. You can read “Greenspan’s Fraud” by R. Batra for more details in a shorter book.

Houts investigated several murder cases in which innocent men had been wrongfully convicted, and brought about a satisfactory conclusion. Houts created 'Trauma', a publication that deals with the field of legal medicine. Forensic medicine applies to many cases, from accidents to the more publicized murders.    Perry Mason and Della Street have lunch at a restaurant, and are served by a new waitress Katherine Ellis. The next morning Kit Ellis visits Mason for a consultation about her Aunt Sophia. Kit's parents were killed in an automobile accident, she was left penniless, and moved in with Aunt Sophia (who met a divorced man, and turned over her money to him). After he died of heat stroke, his first wife took everything (their divorce wasn't final). Perry Mason said this could be a partnership, and Sophia could claim half of the property. Kit says Aunt Sophia has a hatbox filled with cash, and she is afraid of burglars. Perry advises her to move out for her own safety. Soon Perry gets a phone call from Kit Ellis; she is being accused of theft by a Stuart Baxley. Baxley hired a private detective to get fingerprints from the hatbox. Paul Drake said this is difficult. But Perry Mason knows that Macdonell Associates of Corning NY have invented a method to do this with magnetic dust (Chapter 4).     They learn that Aunt Sophia Atwood is in the hospital, someone hit her on the head with a five-cell flashlight. Kit Ellis had gone back to the house by taxi at night to retrieve her shoes and clothing. Lt. Tragg arrests Kit Ellis at Perry's office (Chapter 9). Mason and Paul Drake visit another person who knows Sophia Atwood (Chapter 10). Perry bait a trap with a seemingly missing will (Chapter 11). Does golf get blamed for things that are the result of human carelessness, stupidity , and foolishness (Chapter 12)? Perry assigns an investigation to Paul Drake: put a female operative at the Gillco Company who can pose as a blind woman (Chapter 14).    The Preliminary Hearing begins with Stuart Baxley. Perry destroys his credibility in his cross-examination. The judge expresses doubt as well (Chapter 15). Then Stuart Baxley changes his story again! In Chapter 16 Perry thinks of a theory that can explain the strange events at that house. Perry and Paul find a cache of money, and are found out by Lt. Tragg (Chapter 17).     In Chapter 18 Perry brings in a surprise witness who reveals shocking secrets! Lt. Tragg admits fingerprints on the flashlight do not match Perry's client, and do match fingerprints on the water cooler, but are from an unknown person. Perry later hands Lt. Tragg some fingerprints to analyze. Kit Ellis is freed to rejoin her Aunt Sophia (Chapter 19). [This has one of the happiest endings in this series.] One point is how medicine has advanced so what could have killed in the past is now treatable. Another point is how a person's fortune can suddenly be changed due to circumstances beyond their control. There is a lesson here, but the young will not learn it.	2005-08-11

Too few people appreciate the importance of legal medicine or its ramifications. It can decide questions that affect insurance or about the circumstances of death (which was the wound of entrance and which was the wound of exit. An expert in forensic medicine can give answers and also demonstrate why his answers are correct.    Kerry Dutton visits Perry Mason for legal consultations. Templeton Ellis, the father of Desere Ellis, set up a spend-thrift trust. Kerry Dutton would dole out money on a monthly basis to Desere because her father disapproved of her friends: long-haired, bearded, left-wing idealists who tapped into Desere's funds. Dutton had held back and mingled some stocks in his name as trustee, and must make an accounting in a few months (Dutton is in love with the younger Desire). Mason tells him what he must do to safeguard Desire's securities (Chapter 1). The author parodies Fred Hedley as an original thinker who spouts cliches. When Desere realizes her inheritance is about used up she wishes she had been less extravagant. Desere plans to take business courses to make a living (Chapter 2). In Chapter 3 a stockbroker explains why good news is printed about an oil company that had been on the decline: to raise its price before a proxy fight! Since this stock had been owned in Desere's trust, Fred Hedley sees a tangible fortune for spending. [There is an obvious lesson here warning young people to be careful in picking their friends.]    Perry calls Paul Drake to investigate Kerry Dutton (Paul drives an older car that blends in with traffic). Jarvis Reader shows up to complain about Kerry Dutton and his earlier sale of that oil stock; he wants an apology (Chapter 4). Drake follows Dutton to Desere Ellis' apartment, Hedley shows up and there's a fight; the police arrive, but Dutton has left. Drake and his men track Dutton so Perry and Della can talk to him (Chapter 8). Their talk is interrupted when the police show up and arrest Dutton for murder! Drake calls Perry to tell him that a body was found at the golf club that Dutton visited last night. Perry visits Dutton in jail, and listens to his story. Perry tells him how a jury would view his actions (Chapter 12). Dutton admits he found his gun by the body, picked it up, then discarded it by the road. Perry tells Dutton he isn't telling all of the facts. Perry then interviews Desere to hear her story. Drake gives a report on the victim Rodger Palmer, and his connection to Jarvis Reader and his oil company (Chapter 14). Perry faces a difficult battle in court, given the prosecution's theory and what his client has said (Chapter 15). Then a surprise witness shows up who may save Perry's client (Chapter 17). Chapter 18 has the testimony of Kerry Dutton, and his cross-examination by Hamilton Burger. Dutton makes damaging admissions about selling and buying the oil stock.    Hamilton Burger questioned the reliability of that surprise witness (Chapter 19). Perry realizes that more investigation is needed. Hamilton Burger questions Paul Drake on his economic involvement with Perry Mason (Chapter 22). The newspapers report that the murdered man, Rodger Palmer, had once been a suspect in two murder cases; a coincidence. Perry notices something, and puts an anonymous ad in the night edition, with a telephone number that will be answered by an operative of Paul Drake. This trap snares someone who shoots when discovered, flees, but is trapped by a police roadblock. The solution frees Dutton. [This is a very interesting story, but the ending came as a complete surprise to me.]	2005-08-11

Gardner wrote the \\"Perry Mason\\" novels and other works. Gardner and others formed \\"The Court of Last Resort\\" to investigate the wrongfully convicted. The background tells of the era, the monetary figures date these stories. Gardner's stories warned of the dangers of invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. While ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (before or after the crime). \\"Perry Mason\\" advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer.<br /><br />\\"The Troubled Trustee\\" (1965) starts when a trustee visits Perry to ask for legal advice about commingled funds. [Its not what you think.] This oil investment has jumped in value. Later a dead man is found, shot with the trustee's gun. It looks bad for Perry's client until a new witness is found. The murdered man had been a suspect in two murder cases. Perry puts a blind ad in a newspaper and snares a suspect. This solution frees Perry's client.<br /><br />\\"The Drowsy Mosquito\\" (1943) begins when Della and Perry visit a ranch on business. Someone fired shots at night, later people are poisoned. There is a question about fraud in a sale of a mine. Were two people poisoned or faking it with ipecac? Who sold worthless land to a city slicker? Perry talks to the DA and Sheriff, then gets an admission from a guilty witness. This early Perry Mason is more of a detective than a courtroom lawyer.

This book was quickly published as a memoir of his experiences with that #2 official of the FBI. It has an index but no table of contents. In 1992 Woodward went to the FBI headquarters to examine their Watergate files. The Watergate burglary was part of a sweeping pattern of illegal, undercover activities against Nixon's perceived enemies (p.7). The Senate hearings on Pat Gray saw him release FBI files that substantiated the reports of Woodward and Bernstein (p.13). Other facts leaked out, and these crimes led to Nixon's resignation on 8/9/74. The identity of \\"Deep Throat\\" was kept hidden for 33 years. In 1969 Woodward was a full lieutenant in the Navy with Top Secret security clearance who also acted as a courier carrying documents to the White House. One evening he met Mark Felt and conversed with him; Woodward received Mark Felt's business phone number and later consulted with him about his future (p.23). Woodward chose reporting over law or marketing (p.26),<br /><br />Chapter 3 tells how Woodward began his career as a reporter. He was told by Mark Felt that newspapers rarely got to the bottom of events (p.32). Woodward did investigate stories that other newspapers followed. J. Edgar Hoover, and Mark Felt, opposed Nixon's plan for a Nazi-style secret police (pp.33-34). Woodward joined the `Washington Post' and worked hard (p.37). He also kept secret his knowledge of Felt (pp.39-40). In Chapter 4 Woodward quotes Felt about Hoover's campaign to discredit Martin Luther King because of the \\"drunken sexual orgies\\". Felt also believed that a leader who committed crimes deserved to be exposed (p.43). This explains Felt's actions as a secret source to Woodward! The description of Felt's career seems to have been copied from \\"The FBI Pyramid\\" without attribution (p.44). After the shooting of George Wallace, Woodward called Felt for leads about Arthur Bremer and reported he was a lone gunman (pp.49-50). Chapter 5 has Woodward's short history of the Watergate burglary and its investigation that led to Nixon's impeachment. When the Department of Justice failed to investigate, Felt decided to talk to Woodward (p.81). By October 1972 Nixon was told that Mark Felt was the leak, but he hadn't committed a crime (pp.85-86). Felt retired in June 1973, but kept in touch (p.103). Felt used clandestine means to publicize hidden information (p.104). Felt's involvement was kept a deep, dark secret (p.111), in spite of reports to the contrary (p.116).<br /><br />Felt and Miller were convicted of ordering warrantless searches. Soon afterwards they both received full and unconditional pardons from President Reagan. \\"Justice ultimately prevails\\" (p.147). Chapter 11 discusses various attempts to discover \\"Deep Throat\\". In Chapter 12, Woodward telephones Mark Felt, and discovers the effects of aging on memory. Woodward meets Felt over lunch. Felt was on a raw food diet for 2 months to bring his cholesterol down (p.171). Chapter 13 has Woodward's interview with Felt, who has few specific recollections. Woodward's protection of his sources helped his reports on government (p.184). The importance of Mark Felt is that he exposed the corrupt system of justice in the Nixon administration (p.186). But he didn't do it alone. Chapter 14 has a later phone conversation with Mark Felt, who remembered less than before. Chapter 15 tells of Woodward's work on this book. Felt's memory was going away. Felt's denial that he was \\"Deep Throat\\" shows than anyone in a jam will say anything to protect himself (p.213). Did Felt act to save the Bureau (p.215)? Was Felt's motive to see the truth published (p.217)? In the end, most of Nixon's inner circle turned on him and testified (p.218). History has judged. The book ends with Carl Bernstein's assessment, and explains why they finally acknowledged Mark Felt as \\"Deep Throat\\".nman (pp.49-50). Chapter 5 has Woodward's short history of the Watergate burglary and its investigation that led to Nixon's impeachment. When the Department of Justice failed to investigate, Felt decided to talk to Woodward (p.81). By October 1972 Nixon was told that Mark Felt was the leak, but he hadn't committed a crime (pp.85-86).

The Case of the Cautious Coquette<br /><br />The ‘Foreword’ dedicates this book to parole boards, the perennial underdog in the field of public relations. When a prisoner is released on parole he has to follow rules: reporting to a parole officer, remaining gainfully employed, etc. If he serves his full sentence there is no control over his activities. Failures are publicized, successes are not. Yet increasing inmates without facilities means no space for new inmates. Parole is the reward for any prisoner who shows signs of rehabilitation.<br /><br />Perry Mason is a lawyer for plaintiffs in a hit-and-run accident case. They post an advertisement for any witness who can identify the speeding black sedan. Perry receives an anonymous typed letter with an address and a key; this letter tells where to look for a description of the license plate. It appears to be a trap. Perry goes to this address, knocks on Lucille Barton's door, and is received by a young woman who disavows all knowledge of the accident. She has been recently with a large alimony, and wants a lawyer who can figure out how she can keep this alimony when she remarries. Perry notes that her stationary and typewriter match the anonymous letter. Later, Perry returns to find a license number in the notebook, and a .38 revolver. He notes the serial number, then traces the license number. Perry then goes to visit the owner of that car, a big black sedan which has recent repairs and repainting. The owner, Stephen Argyle, said his car was stolen earlier that day, but quickly found by the police just about the time he reported it! Now Perry has enough to start his investigation, but Paul Drake must work fast (Chapter 6). Carlotta Boone was in to pick up the reward money, but she had a different story and license number! Could this be a red herring? Perry and Della find the black Packard sedan which has been in a recent accident. The owner confesses to the hit-and-run, then writes out a large check for the injured youth (Chapter 7). Could there be two guilty parties to the same crime?<br /><br />Perry goes back to question the first source, Lucille Barton. He finds a connection to Stephen Argyle via Lucille's first husband. Perry asks Lucille to leave with him, then they find the body of Hartwell Pitkin, Stephen Argyle's chauffeur and her first husband, shot dead in her garage! Perry tells Lucille to call the police, but she doesn't do it until later. Chapter 12 explains why an accident victim should never sign anything without first checking with their lawyer. When Perry does not get a call from the police, he drives by Lucille's place, and discovers Lucille's double-cross (Chapter 14). Did she outsmart Perry Mason? Did Perry make a mistaken assumption (Chapter 15)? Paul Drake reports about his investigation, and that the police figured out the shooting was a murder. They traced the gun even after serial numbers were ground off. Is Perry Mason involved over his head? Can he save his client as well as himself?<br /><br />This story has the early version of Perry Mason, part private detective, who sometimes acts just within the letter of the law. The later version of Perry Mason doesn't play fast and loose with the facts (Chapter 22). Perry's plan to take flash photographs at the motel discredits the identification of him (Chapter 25). Perry warns Lucille Barton that she will be found guilty of murder given the facts uncovered so far. The Preliminary Hearing puts the various witnesses on the stand for questioning. There is a recess in the hearing. Perry Mason asks Lt. Tragg to drive to a residence. They see a witness pack a bag then take off; they follow, and the story ends with Perry Mason's client being freed (Chapter 30). The ending tells how and why these murders occurred.

It is as if it was prepared for a magazine, or a film script that covers the dramatic scenes and highlights. Voiceovers could be used to connect these scenes. <br />	2005-07-30

It contains a Perry Mason novelette and three short stories. Two predate the Perry Mason series.    The \\"Crying Swallow\\" story begins when Della Street brings a pile of money to Perry Mason from a new client. Major Claude L. Winnett, millionaire playboy, aviator, and POW wants to find his new wife who has disappeared. Marcia left a goodbye letter. There had been a burglary the day before Marcia disappeared. Claude heard a swallow crying just before his wife screamed as she saw the burglar. Perry, Della, and Paul Drake will visit his estate and inspect the property. Perry looks into the swallow's nest and finds something; a stored shotgun was not loaded with ammunition. They notice tracks and signs on a road outside of the fence. Perry looks at a trash pile and concludes it was from a man (Chapter 5). Paul Drake's detectives search for the man who bought a lot of groceries early Sat. morning. Their search locates the trailer, but its occupant will not answer any questions. The search for Marcia Winnett locates her by her clothes, and Perry and Della track her to her hotel. Marcia tells how she was blackmailed, and staged a jewel robbery for a payoff to her first husband. Della takes Marcia to a private hospital for her recovery. Perry gathers the facts, and surmises what happened (Chapter 10). Complications are resolved. Unlike many other cases, the murderer is somebody who has not been introduced earlier in the story. This 1947 story is quite shorter than most other cases, as if it was written for a magazine and did not get the usual developed  plot.    \\"The Candy Kid\\" is about Lester Leith, a gentleman who can solve a crime from a newspaper story and then hijack the loot from the robber. Lester imagines how jewels could be hidden in a candy shop. The story tells how Sergeant Ackley plans to frame Leith. A sweet deal? Leith cleverly deduced the solution of the stolen jewels. This amusing story is from the 1920s era.    \\"The Vanishing Corpse\\" is about Sidney Zoom, who can see well in the dark. Officer O'Hara captures a person in the dim light and finds a young girl! What is she doing by the deserted docks at night? Why does she have a pistol? What is in her handbag? The police investigate to learn her background. Was there a theft and a murder? The missing man is seen dead in his car, but when the police arrive the corpse has vanished from a locked automobile! The case against Mildred Kroom isn't perfect. Sidney Zoom explains why she is innocent. A wild story? A psychological trick catches the murderer. Is it \\"divine justice\\"?    \\"The Affair of the Reluctant Witness\\" introduces us to Jerry Bane, the heir of a spendthrift trust. He sees the picture of a grocery store owner sued for defamation of character. Is it a scam? Will lawyer Arthur Anson take this case? \\"Mugs\\" Magoo investigates and learns the facts behind the story. Jerry talks to Bernice Calhoun. She describes the life of an owner-operated business. Jerry comes up with a ruse that will help Bernice and allow her to travel out of state. There is a happy ending for some in this clever story. [Does it mirror \\"Perry Mason\\"?]	2005-07-30

Gardner hopes that the public will appreciate the importance of legal medicine. Gardner did not live to see \\"Quincy M.E.\\",or \\"CSI\\".     Della Street has gone on vacation, and Perry Mason stops by to join her on the beach. Della tells Perry of a mystery about a young voluptuous blonde woman. She is eating a huge lunch as if to desperately put on weight, and is always alone. Perry is intrigued by this situation. Della's aunt Mae Kirby introduces Perry to Dianne Alder, the blonde woman. Over dinner Dianne explains why she wants to gain weight - she is being paid for this! Dianne will model a new style for women who are not as thin as a fashion model. Perry tells Della there is something wrong about Dianne's contract, and ask her to find out more. The next morning Dianne meets Perry with her contract. It seems completely reasonable; but Dianne has agreed to share any money she should receive from any source. Perry thinks of an explanation (pp.23-24), and decides to have Harrison T. Boring investigated as well as Dianne Alder. Then Dianne finds that her contract has been broken, and now must take the weight off. Perry tells Boring that he must see him ASAP. Boring explains that he is a Hollywood promoter whose plans didn?t work out, and can't pay a cent. After he leaves, Perry realizes the contract is a variation of a known racket: find someone who has inherited unknowingly and get them to sign over half.    So Perry has Paul Drake investigate the persons involved. The information gathered is given to Perry, who decides on a course of action. Perry goes to visit George D. Winlock, a wealthy real estate developer. In Chapter 8 Winlock tells Perry what Perry has surmised, and explains his activities. The situation is coming to a boil. Soon the dead body ofBoring is found.    When the police come to talk to Dianne Alder, Perry Mason refuses their request because Dianne is emotionally upset (p.137). George D. Winlock arrives, talks to Perry, then telephones the Chief of Police (p.150); George has political connections. Another visitor tells Perry that Winlock's home was wired to monitor conversations, and offers a deal. There are penalties for not reporting a crime, or not reporting an injured person (p.157-157). Mrs. Winlock offers Perry a deal for his client Dianne, quid pro quo. What can be surmised from an empty motel room (p.161)? Chapter 15 has the critical testimony at the Preliminary Hearing. Perry converses with Mrs. Winlock by telephone, and Mr. Winlock in person. Could they have worked out a shrewd and clever stunt (p.202)? Perry Mason's brilliant cross-examination of a recalled witness brings out the truth (Chapter 17). Dianne is saved, the Winlocks are spared notoriety, so Dianne will receive a windfall inheritance (Chapter 18). Like some other of these stories, they subtly critique the rich and powerful.    I picked up the hint as to the guilty party much earlier. There's a convention to murder mysteries where the guilty person earlier admits to some wrongdoing. The reader can't say they weren't warned.	2005-07-28

They created a new central headquarters for the state's medical examiner, with floors for teaching and research on forensic medicines. A modern medical examiner system protects the living. Most murders are committed among friends and family members. Many poisonings may go undetected without a medical examiner; they are far more numerous that the average person suspects (p.6)! <br /> <br />While Perry Mason and Della Street were away from the office a woman came in who feared for her life. But after giving her name, Adelle Hastings, she stepped out to the corridor and did not return. Then Perry received a phone call from Mr. Huntley L. Banner who is representing Garvin S. Hastings in the divorce. So Perry gets Paul Drake to investigate the individuals. Perry and Della follow the clues by flying to Las Vegas to investigate Adelle Hastings. Now the complications begin (Chapter Three). Adelle Hastings tells her story. Perry points out the inconsistencies, and says the police are too thorough and clever to be fooled by it. If Adelle was telling the truth she has an imposter pulling tricks on her. On the return charter flight Perry learns that a young woman had questioned the pilot about them (Chapter Four)! Adelle has realized that something is very wrong, and comes to see Perry at his office (Chapter Five). And yes, they learn that Garvin S. Hastings has been murdered. Then Huntley L. Banner calls with information he just got from Garvin Hastings! There is an educational part about people in a line-up who appear similar. Did Garvin fail to make a will to provide for Adelle, his third wife? Could his second wife have cooked up this scheme? <br /> <br />So the story continues with Perry Mason talking with the various people involved in this case. The dialogue slowly draws out the facts about the situation. Perry Mason learns more about the background facts. There is amystery about the gun found in the handbag. It disappears from Perry's desk then is brought back. But is it the same gun? District Attorney Hamilton Burger shows up and personally investigates Hastings Enterprises. Then there are a number of surprises that leaves Burger dumbfounded (p.163). The police find the gun is the murder weapon, and a fingerprint is on it. Adelle Hastings is arrested for the murder of Garvin Hastings. <br /> <br />The Preliminary Hearing has many interesting pages of testimony on the gun and its possession (Chapter Twelve). Perry has to do a lot of investigative work for his client, and this create more work (p.213). Perry asks one witness to hand the dark glasses to his receptionist. A further investigation by the police unravels the plot. Garvin Hastings has made a holographic will, dated and signed. This had been destroyed by the woman who impersonated Adelle Hastings. But by law, this destruction doesn't affect the validity of that will. Adelle Hastings is not guilty of the murder, and will inherit a fortune, thanks to Perry Mason. <br />	2005-07-28

His clients are always exonerated. The entertainment is in the search to uncover the truth that will free his client in a surprising ending. Gardner tells facts about the laws and other new developments. The monetary figures date these stories. Details like a “writ of habeas corpus” are now obsolete due to decisions from the Warren Supreme Court. Prosecutors must provide exculpatory evidence (Brady Rule), and the use of “third degree” methods are now only found in old films. [Or are they?] Forensic sciences has made great advances. Just as fingerprints could be forged or planted (Sir Harry Oakes murder trial), so perhaps DNA evidence too. Human error is always with us. Read these novels to learn why Gardner outsold his competitors in his lifetime.<br /><br />These novels warned against invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. While ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (before or after the crime). “Perry Mason” advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer. There is a famous true crime that has the above elements. Sacco & Vanzetti were convicted of robbery and murder in spite of their alibis and the lack of guilty evidence. Most believe they were innocent and were convicted by prejudice.<br /><br />“The Case of the Runaway Corpse” [1954] begins with Myrna asking Perry Mason about a letter from her husband Ed accusing her of poisoning her niece and planning to kill him. The police get involved when Ed is found dead. But then Ed has disappeared! Later his body is found in a shallow grave. There is conflicting testimony between doctors. A witness is recalled, the testimony frees Myrna.<br /><br />“The Case of the Fugitive Nurse” [1954] begins after Stefanie’s husband Dr. Malden died in an airplane crash. She is arrested for murder when drugs were found in a flask in the airplane. Perry Mason finds the body’s teeth did not match her husband. Perry explains what must have happened.<br /><br />“The Case of the Green Eyed Sister” [1953] begins when Sylvia visits Perry Mason about a claim against her future inheritance. Her father’s property may be confiscated. There is a murder and another death. There are problems with tape recordings and post mortem lividity. A new search for evidence leads to a solution and freedom for Perry’s client.	2005-07-28

The dialogue carries the interest of the reader. There is a minimum of characterization or description of surroundings. Gardner did not put dates in his novels, but the backgrounds and dollar figures tell about the times prior to 1971. His stories often involved some new technical development or some obscure law. Some of the legal issues (like habeas corpus) became obsolete due to Supreme Court rulings since the 1950s. Municipal corruption or shady business dealings occur in these stories as a warning for readers.<br /><br />Gardner's stories warned of the dangers of invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. Some stories made the point that while ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (before or after the crime). &#34;Perry Mason&#34; advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer.<br /><br />The Case of the Blonde Bonanza. Perry Mason notices a young woman eating a huge lunch. She will get a job as a model if she puts on weight! Is there a variation on an old racket in this deal? When the man who made this contract is found murdered Perry's client is a suspect. Perry saves his client.<br /><br />Two Clues. These two stories use psychological clues to solve the murder rather than the science of material details. It is more like “Father Brown” than “Sherlock Holmes”.<br /><br />The Runaway Blonde. A farmer plowed his field and found the body of a young woman.  Sheriff Eldon identified Elizabeth Dow. There is a tire with a nick in it, the same as at the crime scene. A consulting criminologist Martin Walworth investigates the case. Sheriff Eldon surmises how the murder occurred, and who did it. The girl’s purse contains the evidence for a motive. Sheriff Eldon solved the murder by his knowledge of “human nature”. The consulting criminologist didn’t have the facts gained from experience.<br /><br />The Hungry Horse. Lew Turlock’s daughter Betty wasn’t home. Irma Jesup calls to talk to Betty. When Lew visited his neighbor’s barn he found a body. Lorraine Calhoun, the daughter of his new neighbors, was dead of a head injury. Why didn’t the mare eat her fodder? Where is Betty? Carl Clausen says the body is not his daughter Lorraine! Sheriff Eldon noticed something strange about the U-shaped mark on the girl’s forehead. The body is identified. Turlock finds a metal bar with a horseshoe welded to it. Who planted it? Who doesn’t know the difference between barley and oat hay? Mae Adrian answers some questions for Sheriff Eldon, he names the suspect. The suspect refuses to answer any questions due to self-incrimination!	2005-07-28

The background tells of the era, the monetary figures date these stories.<br /><br />&#34;The Perjured Parrot&#34; (1939) begins with Perry Mason telling that he only takes a case if he is convinced his client is innocent. Discrepancies in the evidence will free his client. A new client shows up, his father's murder was in today's newspapers. Fremont Sabin was shot with an obsolete derringer, only his pet parrot was in the isolated hunting cabin. Charles Sabin, his son, wants to preserve the will that left the estate to him. Fremont married his housekeeper but became very unhappy. The parrot found in the cabin was NOT his father's pet parrot, this may be a clue to solving the murder. The time of death was estimated as the morning when the fishing season began. Fremont's secretary received a telephone call from Fremont the night before and was told to fly to New York (he has an alibi). Sheriff Barnes estimated the time of death from the caught fish and the canned beans eaten for lunch. Perry noticed someone was tapping Fremont's telephone! Wire-tapping is a felony, private detectives don't do it. Fremont Sabin had been donating to the group that was investigating official corruption; scores of people would murder him if they found out. Paul Drake tracks down parrot sales and finds the shop that recently sold a parrot, and who bought parrot food. The murder weapon was part of the collection at the Public Library's museum. A librarian will be arrested for murder as soon as the police learn about her. Perry meets the very combative widow. Does the parrot offer a key to the solution? What if the divorce decree was forged? Can a parrot testifyin court without committing perjury? Circumstantial evidence is the interpretation drawn from the known facts. Perry reveals an explanation derived from the facts, one that accounts for discrepancies. A summoned witness left, and Perry's client goes free. Then there is a very shocking surprise ending. In fact or fiction, any eyewitness can be mistaken or lying when there is no corroborative evidence for the testimony.<br /><br />&#34;The Case of the Caretaker's Cat&#34; (1935) begins when a caretaker consults Perry Mason about his cat. Perry cautions Charles Ashton about his situation. Della Street looks down and sees Ashton is being followed. The investigation takes them to the private nurse who was on duty the night of the fire. She saw a strange event before the fire, but can't recognize the man in the garage. Why was a hose from the exhaust pipe of that car running into the heating system air vent? After they exhume the body they find a murder. When Hamilton Burger goes to the house they find Ashton murdered! Ashton's cat was saved. Mason and Drake go to visit Douglas Keene, they learn he has fled. Mason is able to bring in Douglas Keene to the police. By reporting the new car stolen the police will stop and question the real owner! It works. The witnesses are questioned. Mason explains the importance of holding and safeguarding the caretaker's cat, and what would have happened if another cat was brought to Ashton's room. Mason provides a shocking surprise ending.

Perry explains why something trivial could develop into something big - like rejecting a client whose suit would have destroyed a prosecuting witness’ alibi (p.6). Perry cautions Mr. Charles Ashton about his situation, and the Peter Laxter will (made two days before he died in a fire). Perry writes a letter for Mr. Ashton, who the leaves. But Della Street looks down to the street, and sees Mr. Ashton is being followed. Perry likes trial law because it isn’t routine, and involves human nature (Chapter II).<br /><br />The investigation takes them to the private nurse who was on duty the night of the fire. This conversation is instructive. Edith DeVoe witnesses a strange event a few hours before the fire, but can’t be sure of the identity of the man in the garage. Why was a hose from the exhaust pipe of that car running into the heating system air vent? Would death by fire mask carbon monoxide poisoning (Chapter V)? Dr. Jason explains how he could make a determination based on the condition of the body. After they exhume the body, Dr. Jason says to go ahead with the investigation of murder. When District Attorney Hamilton Burger goes to the house to question Sam Laxter they find Charles Ashton murdered! Perry goes to see Winifred Laxter, and finds Ashton’s cat. Her boyfriend Douglas Keene brought it to her for safekeeping.<br /><br />Mason and Drake go to visit Douglas Keene. To avoid notice, they park over a block away and walk there. The apartment is empty, as if the occupant hastily left. There are red spatters in the bathroom washbowl. Mason and Drake the find out when Edith DeVoe married Frank Oakley (the other heir of Peter Laxter). When they search for Douglas Keene at Winifred Laxter’s shop they learn he has fled. They get information on Ashton’s crutch, and a new suspect to consider. In Chapter XII Sergeant Holcomb summarizes the case against Douglas Keene, and tells Mason that they found the cat.

They are reminiscences of her early years when living on the western frontier of America in the post-Civil War era. While a smell can stimulate memory, many pages are written about the cooking and foods that they had. Laura also describes the intricacies of female dress of that time. Hoop skirts were probably killed off by the bicycle craze of the late 1880s, they even hindered getting into a buggy. The outlook also changes as she ages from a child to teenager to woman.    The \\"Little House ... Big Woods / Prairie\\" reflect her life as a child and how she remembers it. Since she was very young in Wisconsin, her memory must have been recovered from the stories of Ma and Pa and her older sister Mary. Could later events have affected her memories? \\"Farmer Boy\\" is about the youth of Almanzo Wilder, her future husband, and his life in the far north of New York state. These books are child-oriented.    \\"Plum Creek / Silver Lake\\" are about her later years, where she is aware of things like economic conditions that wouldn't be noticed by a child. The \\"Long Winter\\", about the terrible winter of 1880/1881, is most oriented to an adult in its description of life on the breaking edge of settlement. The story about the railroad camp won't have much meaning to children who have never experienced such hardships. It is a warning against the assumptions of the corporate railroad. If they build a railroad, the trains may not come on time.    \\"Little Town / Golden Years\\" are about her schooling, her school teaching, and her drives in the country with Almanzo, her future husband. I hope they had the happy married life that they deserved.    The books tell what is was like in the late 19th century. If you wondered about the roof on a sod house you will find a description here. Laura tells about digging a well, but the conventions of her time prevent any description on the location of their privy. The politics and events of that time are rarely mentioned, but children and teenagers don't care even today. Then it was work from sun up to sun down, except for Sunday. The Ingalls seem more religious than some others.    There is an economic side to these stories. In the first books the Ingalls live as subsistence farmers, growing or building most of what they consume. Pa hunts game for meat. In the middle of the stories Pa can't hunt, he must buy meat from the wages he earns in town. Laura works so her money can help send Mary to college. By the end the settlers are all raising cash crops to sell. They still have gardens to raise household food, and sew clothes from the cloth they buy. No more homespun. Labor saving devices are bought, like a breaking plow. Mechanized reapers and thrashers are now hired as needed. The forces of nature can still wipe out months and years of work in a few minutes. Hail and tornadoes threaten the growing crops. But the Ingalls strive, endure, and succeed, setting a good example for future countless generations.	2005-07-22

They are reminiscences of her early years when living on the western frontier of America in the post-Civil War era. While a smell can stimulate memory, many pages are written about the cooking and foods that they had. Laura also describes the intricacies of female dress of that time. Hoop skirts were probably killed off by the bicycle craze of the late 1880s, they even hindered getting into a buggy. The outlook also changes as she ages from a child to teenager to woman. <br /> <br />The \\"Little House ... Big Woods / Prairie\\" reflect her life as a child and how she remembers it.

The Ingalls moved back to their shanty on their claim, and life continued. Work took up all their time in the spring. Pa had a new plow for breaking the prairie sod; it spared the horses, and Pa too. After the planting was done Pa and Laura built the missing part of the claim shanty; now there was two bedrooms. There is a new problem in the cornfield; gophers ate half of the kernels. A good cat would help here. Pa loses some of his hair to a mouse. The many new settlers resulted in the need to organize a county. When Pa returned he brought a kitten for them to raise. Pa worked as a carpenter in town building the new church. Laura hoped she could get a job teaching school when she turned sixteen. Pa could not hunt game, but could only buy meat. Mrs. Brant would give a setting of eggs, so they would have chickens (if hawks or weasels or foxes didn't get them). Better times were coming! Their little kitty killed its first mouse. Pa tells Laura she could work in town sewing shirts for bachelors. Laura had never seen a store that sold only dry goods. She also saw another type of family life. Laura also saw two drunken men.<br /><br />After six weeks of work, Laura experienced a lay-off. The Ingalls got 14 chicks, a gift from Mrs. Boast. The Fourth of July starts with a \\"BOOM\\", and Laura walks to town with Pa and Carrie (Chapter 8). They hear firecrackers and a speech. There is a threat from \\"Spanish needle grass\\",  and blackbirds are eating the shocked oats. \\"Earthly life is a battle\\" said Ma (p.89). Chapter 9 tells of the complications in women's dresses. The blackbirds were devouring their corn and oats. Pa shot as many as he could, and they found they were good to eat. The new school year sees Mary going away to a college in Iowa. Laura and Carrie return to the town school, and note how it has grown in the last year. Laura is surprisedto find Nellie Oleson at school! Nellie puts on airs, but Pa tells Laura that Mr. Oleson lost his business and is just like the other homesteaders (p.135). In the fall they picked and packed vegetables for winter in town. The town was prepared for a harsh winter. But little Carrie was thin and pale. The new teacher Miss Wilder seemed to favor Nellie Oleson. There is trouble, and Laura and Carrie are sent home from school by the teacher. The children resent this teacher, and were disorderly. Nellie was two-faced (p.172).<br /><br />One morning Almanzo offers Laura a ride to school, and they exchange name cards. The people in town start a literary society for their entertainment and education. Pa Ingalls suggests a formal organization could get in the way of the functions (Chapter 18). They chose sides for a spelling match. On Thanksgiving they attend a church supper. In late March they are entertained by a minstrel show. The new grass shows in April, and so does a surprise blizzard. Two newcomers from the East were lost (they did not dig into a haystack). Kitty caught more gophers, and some blackbirds. Mr. Owen, the new teacher, taught Willie Oleson to do better in school. The Ingalls family goes to the revival meeting. Almanzo walks Laura home from the revival meeting every night. Laura was invited to a sleigh ride. They celebrate their first Christmas without Mary, and feel sad. Laura meets Mr. Brewster, who is looking for a new teacher in their district, and wants Laura! Laura accepts this job offer, contingent upon getting a teaching certificate. The Superintendent of School tests and passes Laura to teach. Laura will start next week. Pa is on the school board, and knows Mr. Brewster.	2005-07-21

Pa tells Laura that she's never failed at anything she tried to do. Laura must board with the Brewsters. Mrs. Brewster is unhappy, and would like to go back East. Almanzo Wilder comes to bring Laura home for the weekend. His home-made cutter is smaller and lighter than boughten ones. Laura has some problems with her students, but learns to manage them. One day it is so cold that school is closed for the day. Another cold day makes study in school difficult; everyone must wear a coat. The sleigh ride back home was very, very cold. They stop often so Almanzo could clear ice from the horse's nostrils! When school ended, the students thanked Laura and gave her gifts. Laura returned to her school, and found she had kept up. Her composition on \\"Ambition\\" (p.98) was judged the best. Laura can work at sewing on Saturdays. Laura realized how much she appreciated home after she had lived away (Chapter 12).<br /><br />April brings melting show and springtime. Uncle Tom from the Big Woods of Wisconsin visits (Chapter 13). He tells of his trip to the Black Hills. They built a stockade to ward off attack by the Indians who besieged them. The US Army came to escort them out; they had no right to live on Indian territory. Their cabins, wagons, and furs were burned, their oxen killed. Laura would stay with Mrs. McKee and her daughter on their claim while Mr. McKee would work in town. But Laura returned home when Mary came home from Iowa to visit. People come and go; some sell out and go West, other don't like it there and move back East (p.135). Laura worked at sewing in town, Pa as a carpenter. Almanzo takes Laura for a ride every Sunday afternoon. Laura takes the test, and is now Teacher Second Grade. She will teach at the Perry School close to the claim and earn a lot of money. New settlers are seen (p.168). Laura continues to go riding with Almanzo on Sundays.<br /><br />Almanzo arrives with two new horses that he is breaking in. He explains why he sold the matched pair (p.189). The new pair need breaking in and taming; they were a bargain (p 193). One night Laura is wakened so they can all seek shelter from the storm. After the singing school Laura gets a chance to drive the buggy. One autumn drive Almanzo asks Laura about an engagement ring. The next Sunday he slipped a ring on her finger. Next year Almanzo will build a little house on the tree claim. Almanzo and his brother will go to Minnesota for the winter, and the Ingalls will stay at their improved claim house and rent their town building. A surprise visitor shows up for Christmas: Almanzo returned with a present for Laura (Chapter 25). Laura takes the teacher test and gets a second-grade certificate. Ma said that a body makes his own luck, good or bad (p.235). So Laura's school days end. She will teach school, and then be married.<br /><br />One Sunday afternoon they went for a ride in the oppressive heat. Black storm clouds rose, so they returned to home. Pa and Almanzo drove out to see if anyone needed help. One farmer had a splendid wheat crop that would repay his debts; the storm carried it all away, even wagons, stables, and home (p.256). Another family came out of their cyclone cellar to find all was gone. Mary and Laura talk about the good times they had when they were young. Laura wonders if the coming times will be even better (p.264). Neither Almanzo or Laura want a big expensive wedding. They were married by the Reverend Brown in private ceremony. And so they lived happily ever after.	2005-07-21

Pa is using his new mowing machine to cut hay. Laura wants to help; Ma agrees, but she doesn't like it because only foreign women worked in the fields. Laura and Carrie run an errand into town and learn to stick to the road. A frost on the first day of October kills their crops. Pa goes hunting but returns empty-handed; all birds have gone south. The next morning they awake to find a fierce blizzard. They feel uneasy about the weather, and Pa predicts a hard winter. An old Indian comes to town to warn them about a long, hard winter lasting seven months. Pa takes the warning and moves the family into town to their store building for the winter. One day a blizzard suddenly occurs when Laura and Carrie are in school. They must make their way home in a white-out! <br /> <br />Almanzo Wilder had a politically correct understanding at his age (pp.99-100). Now the blizzards occur frequently. The snow blocks the railroads so trains can not bring in food and fuel. Meat, coal, and kerosene run out. The cleared railroad cut was filled with snow 30 feet deep. Their kerosene lamp runs out, and they use wood and hay in place of coal. The coldness increases. In earlier times they burnt fats for light, and wood for heat, materials at hand, unlike kerosene and coal (p.192). Wheat is ground in a coffee mill to make sourdough bread. Ma uses axle grease (tallow?) To make a button lamp. Then they learn that the train can't get through the snow until spring. Their food and fuel won't last. The blizzards pile snow around their house; this helps to keep it warmer. Pa's talents find him a bucket of wheat (p.248). Almanzo Wilder calculates the food supply and the time when a train will bring in supplies; they don't match (pp.255-259). He and Cap Garland take their sleds to search for the farmer with the wheat crop. They find him, and buy 60 bushels at above market prices.Almanzo and Cap quickly load the sacks and immediately start the return trip (pp.278-279). They return, cold but safe, and refuse a payment for their trip. There is a lesson on business and social responsibility in selling the wheat (pp.301-306). The town is saved from starvation by rationing according to need. <br /> <br />Winter lasted so long that it seemed it would never end. They would twist hay for fuel, grind wheat for bread, and shiver until they went to bed. The blizzards went on through March and into April. Then the Chinook blew, and thawed the land. They could not return to their homestead until the shanty was repaired. The train still did not arrive because the snow was packed tight into ice in the railroad cuts (p.315). The melted snows flooded all the roads. A freight train arrived on May 1 the traditional start of summer (p.316). The men show how they can provide for their families (p.321). Their Christmas barrel arrives, and they have a Christmas feast in May (p.326). Mr. & Mrs. Boast tell how they survived the long winter in their claim shanty (p.331). And so this book ends with their yearning for tomorrow's sunshine. <br /> <br />In describing the terrible winter of 1880-1881, this could be a symbol of the Great Depression that was still raging when this book was written. <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

The plague of locusts destroyed their crops one year, and left debts and poor crops afterward. Game for meat was scarce. Aunt Docia visited with a job offer for Pa, but he must leave for a railroad camp in Dakota Territory. A homesteader could get 160 acres there, and hunting is better. Aunt Docia tells the family news from Wisconsin. Another chapter begins for the Ingalls family. Scarlet fever had struck the family, and Mary went blind. Good old faithful Jack expired. Pa left in the covered wagon, and Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace would follow by train. Laura tells Mary about their trains, its windows, and what can be seen. When they stop for dinner Laura is amazed by the railroad turntable. Pa spoke of the wonderful times they were living in. [The Age of Victoria saw many innovations that changed the world.] Pa came in the wagon to take them to their new home. <br /> <br />Uncle Hi worked hard on the railroad all summer. But the company figured he owed them money (Chapter 5)! They are deeper in debt. Laura gets to ride one of the ponies. [Laura's description of the sights to Mary has trained her for journalism.] There was an enormous stillness on this prairie (p.60). They are surprised to find Uncle Henry and his family from the Big Woods of Wisconsin. Pa tells his family about the gambling and horse thieves in the railroad camp. One wonderful afternoon Laura goes with Pa to see them build the railroad. Men with plows break the prairie sod. Scrapers leveled the plowed strip. Low ground is filled in, high ground is cut through to make the grade level. This uses less fuel for the engines. Pa explained how the surveyors measured it all and marked the route.  <br /> <br />The paymaster delivers the cash to Pa, who will distribute the money due to each worker. Pa now carries a revolver for protection against robbers. Some of the men don't like being paidfor only the first two weeks (Chapter 11). There is trouble at another work camp. But work ends for the winter, and everyone leaves. Pa gets the caretaker's job so the family can stay at Silver Lake and live in the Surveyor's House. It is so quiet there you can hear a wolf howl nearby. Visitors come for Christmas, and they feast (Chapter 21). The Reverend Alden also shows up; he will start his church. The warm March weather brings many men who come to settle and claim homesteads. Pa is able to file his claim on the land he wants. But the many people who settle there change the environment. The animals and birds stay away and Pa can't hunt. <br /> <br />There are signs of Laura's maturity. We read about thefts, robbery, and murder. The girls must lock their attic bedroom door when strange men are staying over (room and board), and are not allowed outside by dusk. Pa has a scuffle when registering his claim. When moving to their homestead they see a light wagon drawn by the finest horses in the county; those are the Wilder boys. They move into the little claim shanty. Laura helps Pa put tar paper on the shanty. Settlers must plant ten acres of trees on every section; they break the wind, shade in summer, and provide fuel for winter (p.220). Pa plants cottonwood trees grown from seeds around the shanty. Living near the Big Slough brought mosquitoes at dusk. The wetness that provided plentiful hay had a trade-off. And so the Ingalls settle where lately the buffalo roamed. <br />	2005-07-15

Pa trades his hoses etc. for the crops, land, and dugout house; he wonders about the small field. The book describes their life in their new home. Ma warns Laura against being naughty, since something dreadful can happen (Chapter 5). Laura and Mary have happy care-free days after they do their chores. But they learn that straw is stacked for use, not for play (Chapter 8). <br /> <br />Autumn is unusually warm, no snow at Thanksgiving. Old-timers call it \\"grasshopper weather\\". Pa would like to get a team of horses, because oxen are too slow for harrowing and harvesting. Mary and Laura would make a button-string for their little sister Carrie. Christmas brought them their usual treats, and a team of horses for Pa. Spring brought heavy rains, and a high creek. Laura's rashness is shown by the foot bridge and the swift running stream (Chapter 15). Now that they live close to town Laura and Mary can go to school. Laura plays a devilish trick on haughty Nellie (Chapter 13). \\"Look girls, how Nellie can dance!\\" As the Ingalls family settled near town, they became more dependent on things made by others, and their cash crop of wheat (Chapter 24). But the tragedy of an enormous plague of grasshoppers falls on their land, their crops are devoured. Burning old dirty hay for smoke did not stop them (Chapter 25). Pa went to work to earn money. Grasshoppers laid their eggs everywhere, when they hatched next year they will again devour the crops. Pa will travel east to find work. A cloud brings rain, and things start growing again. A letter arrives from Pa; he found work and sent them money. <br /> <br />When the Ingalls go to town shopping, Laura meets Nellie and gets a little education about class (Chapter 30). But Laura remembers angels don't wear fur capes. [No mention of Nellie's problem of self-esteem.] At the church Christmas party Laura receives a fur cape and muff! This and Mary's coat were donated from back East (Chapter 31). When spring came, the grasshoppers hatched and devoured the crops. Then they walked and flew to the west (Chapter 32). A prairie fire threatened their house. They harvested potatoes and turnips for the winter. Mary and Laura bring in wood for the stove before the blizzard hits. Pa had left for town before the blizzard came, and Ma had to go to the barn to feed the animals and milk the cow. This heavy snow means they will have a bumper crop of wheat next year. It tells how Pa survived the blizzard after being caught out in the open. The book ends with the family united for Christmas. <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

She married Almanzo Wilder (from Malone NY, near the Canadian border), another pioneer who came west as a young man. This book is about young Almanzo and his life as a farmer boy. They ate a hearty farm breakfast. Calories don't count when you walk everywhere, work all day long, and live in a house lacking central heating when it is forty below zero. <br /> <br />Chapter 4 tells schooling in the good old days. Perhaps its explains why William Quantrill or George A. Custer were teachers before their military careers? Chapter 7 describes old-fashioned twisted doughnuts that turn over when cooked in oil. It tells how people lived without running water or electricity for dishwashing. Chapter 9 tells about breaking the calves. You could never teach an animal if you struck it, or shouted at it. You must always be gentle and quiet and patient. The animal must trust to be hard-working. Chapter 11 describes spring planting. Then there was sheep-shearing (Chapter 14). Almanzo's father explains that money is the result of hard work. You can spend and lose it, or you can buy a piglet, raise it, and get more money for it. Father explains that while guns won the Revolution, it was axes and plows that made America by farming the land (Chapter 16). Almanzo had mischievous ways (Chapter 18). Chapter 22 tells of the butchering, and how every part was used. Note how often these memories have to do with feasting on holidays (Chapter 26).

Pa trades his hoses etc. for the crops, land, and dugout house; he wonders about the small field. The book describes their life in their new home. Ma warns Laura against being naughty, since something dreadful can happen (Chapter 5). Laura and Mary have happy care-free days after they do their chores. But they learn that straw is stacked for use, not for play (Chapter 8).<br /><br />Autumn is unusually warm, no snow at Thanksgiving. Old-timers call it \\"grasshopper weather\\". Pa would like to get a team of horses, because oxen are too slow for harrowing and harvesting. Mary and Laura would make a button-string for their little sister Carrie. Christmas brought them their usual treats, and a team of horses for Pa. Spring brought heavy rains, and a high creek. Laura's rashness is shown by the foot bridge and the swift running stream (Chapter 15). Now that they live close to town Laura and Mary can go to school. Laura plays a devilish trick on haughty Nellie (Chapter 13). \\"Look girls, how Nellie can dance!\\" As the Ingalls family settled near town, they became more dependent on things made by others, and their cash crop of wheat (Chapter 24). But the tragedy of an enormous plague of grasshoppers falls on their land, their crops are devoured. Burning old dirty hay for smoke did not stop them (Chapter 25). Pa went to work to earn money. Grasshoppers laid their eggs everywhere, when they hatched next year they will again devour the crops. Pa will travel east to find work. A cloud brings rain, and things start growing again. A letter arrives from Pa; he found work and sent them money.<br /><br />When the Ingalls go to town shopping, Laura meets Nellie and gets a little education about class (Chapter 30). But Laura remembers angels don't wear fur capes. [No mention of Nellie's problem of self-esteem.] At the church Christmas party Laura receives a fur cape and muff! This and Mary's coat were donated from back East (Chapter 31). When spring came, the grasshoppers hatched and devoured the crops. Then they walked and flew to the west (Chapter 32). A prairie fire threatened their house. They harvested potatoes and turnips for the winter. Mary and Laura bring in wood for the stove before the blizzard hits. Pa had left for town before the blizzard came, and Ma had to go to the barn to feed the animals and milk the cow. This heavy snow means they will have a bumper crop of wheat next year. It tells how Pa survived the blizzard after being caught out in the open. The book ends with the family united for Christmas.	2005-07-13

They were sent behind enemy lines near Murmansk, Finland, and Norway to battle German forces and report on military activity. This book was written in the early 1950s but delayed for publication until 1990. The translation is by James F. Gebhardt, a retired US Army major now employed by a defense contractor in Kansas. Viktor Leonov's exploits are comparable to Sergeant York or Audie Murphy. <br /> <br />Leonov joined the Red Navy in 1937 and worked as a submarine mechanic and then in a repair facility. When war started in July 1941 Leonov joined the Naval Scouts (comparable to the US Navy SEALS). Most of this book tells about the operations west of Murmansk, the only Russian port that is ice-free the year around. Leonov's descriptions have a classic restraint that avoids dramatic stories (but you can read between the lines). There is little about personal lives and thoughts. Combat at Cape Krestovy resulted in decorations for all, and a \\"Hero of the Soviet Union\\" (comparable to the Congressional Medal of Honor) for Leonov and two others. The victory in Europe on May 9, 1945 saw the Naval Scouts transferred to the Pacific. <br /> <br />In early August the Soviet Union renounced its Peace Treaty with Japan and attacked the Japanese aggressors (p.180). Their big battle was at Seisin. While Japan surrendered on August 17, fighting still went on at Wonsan. Leonov and nine other scouts went to meet the Japanese garrison commander. The book describes the psychological negotiations with the colonel (pp.197-208). Finally the Japanese colonel ordered all his troops to lay down their arms and surrender. This gave rise to the legend that ten Naval Scouts surrounded 3,000 Japanese troops to get their surrender! Leonov won a second \\"Hero of the Soviet Union\\" award for this action. <br /> <br />This is a book that won't appeal to the general reader but offers interesting insights about the First Front of World War II and a force that may have served as a model for the Navy SEALs.

It provides a description of a primary battle in Lenape county between two bosses, one in New Boynton and the other in Port Alby. The book follows Tom McDonough in his daily life telling what a political boss does. Tom's father kept a saloon with rental apartments, Tom has a riches to more riches story as an important political lawyer. The description of McDonough's daily activities explains the functions of a political boss: to make connections, to do favors, to make things happen, and to profit from these experiences. The political boss must balance and trade-off the various and conflicting demands from groups of people. This may be one reason why so many lawyers are in politics. The other reason is knowing the laws so as not to get caught, and using \\"client confidentiality\\" to avoid testifying.    If you have political parties you'll need leaders to run things. Good leadership costs, it reflects the drive, the knowledge, and their strengths (p.79). [Just as in any business.] Political bosses manage human resources. Reformers may bray about \\"pay to play\\", but they will do the same when they gain power. The system works, just like in Feudal days. Political bosses stay in power by delivering the votes. The attempt to reconcile differences fails, and there will be a bitter Primary fight (Chapter 7). Tom and Carmela visit various taverns and meet varied people; this provides a background to this story. Chapter 13 explains how county-owned land is sold to the highest bidder, via insider knowledge. Nobody goes into business of politics for pleasure; self-interest is paramount (p.128). But due to human nature, somebody talked and this secret deal will be revealed as a political scandal.    The occupational hazard for a politician is ongoing success; the longer he is in office, the more enemies he will make (p.181). The party organization is based on patronage and the favor system. Class and sectional differences make politics, and so do personal ambitions and rivalries. The competition for public office is supposed to give power to the voters so they can choose what is best for them. Politicians may be regarded as dishonest because like advertisers and used car dealers they are believed to promise more than they deliver (p.224). One of the richest men in the state comes to McDonough to get him to end the feud; the wealthy class feels it can rely on the Democrats more (p.262).     Is the absence of pain a blessing or a curse (p.303)? Was the War of Independence followed by the creation of public schools (p.313)? Can a discipline problem in high school affect an election (p.331)? The meeting at McDonough's house goes will until Matt and Lena's treachery is exposed (Chapter 39). People's problems and scandals are revealed to finish this story. Can spreading rumors, or lies, win an election (Chapter 46)? This story has a wide range of personalities and emotions. You wonder what reality was disguised for this fiction. Chapter 54 describes the aftermath of McDonough's primary win. There is a meeting to create a peace treaty, sort of like government laws, with its give and take. Chapter 55 gives a short history on picking candidates (p.489). You should vote in primaries. McDonough wins the primary, but suffers a great personal loss.    As a long-time resident of \\"Lenape\\" county I recognized the reality behind this novel. I wonder if \\"Francis T. Field\\" was a reporter for the \\"New Boynton Home News\\"?	2005-07-01

MI5 is the secret agency that handles counter-espionage in British territories. MI6 handles espionage or \\"intelligence\\" in foreign countries. Chapter 1 tells about their operations in the last year of WW II. The Labor government, remembering the Zinoviev Letter, put a regular policeman in charge. Chapter 2 tells how an \\"autobiography\\" can be created and published for political purposes. And how decryption of Soviet messages pointed to spies, but this decryption had to be kept secret. New security checks were started for civil servants, and improved. The policy of American anti-imperialism in the 1950s annoyed the British. Chapter 3 tells how the defection of the Petrovs was used for advantage in the national election (p.89). Success came from secret wiretaps on Soviet cables. Pages 106-7 tell how information from Washington got a conviction in Britain! One of the greatest sources of information came from a KGB defector who identified MI6 traitors (Chapter 5). While MI5 had run the successful double-cross system against Germany, it was less successful against the Soviets. Did the KGB have agents there? <br /> <br />Chapter 6 tells how MI5 used Stephen Ward to supply girls, then abandoned him when he outlived his usefulness. This caused the Profumo Scandal and the fall of the MacMillan government. [Was there more to this story than given here?] The effects of other Soviet defectors are explained in Chapter 7. The KGB could reveal a spy when it suited their purposes. The leak about a defector was assumed to come from the KGB; but in fact it came from the CIA (p.189)! The hunt of Soviet moles is continued in Chapter 8. Better background investigations could have eliminated the spies. The unsuccessful search for a Soviet mole caused problems for MI5. In Chapter 9 new officials continued the hunt for a suspected traitor, going back to World War I when there was a large number of new people after the Bolshevik Revolution. One retired MI6 officer sold information to the Abwehr in the 1930s (p.229). Suspicion fell on a retired Deputy Director General, but no proof was found. There is the curious case where the KGB kidnapped a Soviet physicist in Britain (pp.269-270). One example of recruitment through blackmail is on page 271. The defection of Soviet military officers in 1968 was followed by the suicides of West German military officers (pp.273-274). Did Lord Mountbatten plan a coup d'etat against the Wilson government (p.286)?  <br /> <br />Chapter 10 ends this story, explaining the decisions in appointing a new Director-General of MI5 (p.297). The 'D' branch found most of its spies from defector's stories, few from their investigations. {How does this compare to other services?] There were two types of spies. Those who were ideologically motivated had researchable connections. Opportunists for money are harder to find. The author contrasts Britain to the United States (pp.306-307). Other Western intelligence agencies had self-destructive mole hunts (p.309), but MI5 was reluctant to admit the possibility of a problem. A bureaucratic institution will hide its problems. The KGB are masters at decoy and deception to protect their valuable agents (pp.310-311). Will we see an updated version? <br /> <br />	2005-06-30

The US Secret Service was used for counter-intelligence before FDR turned this over to Hoover's FBI in the 1930s. This book does not tell of counter-intelligence during the Civil War by Allan Pinkerton's Secret Service, and its useful anonymity. The issuance of Federal paper money, \\"greenbacks\\", meant new opportunities for counterfeiters. Lafayette C. Baker pursued them, and Confederate spies, with avenging fury. One of Lincoln's last actions was to create a permanent force to catch these \\"coney men\\" (p.10). They expanded to detect other frauds against the federal government (p.19). They also put an end to the Ku Klux Klan (p.20), and \\"toy money\\" (p.23). <br /> <br />Protection started with President Grover Cleveland (p.24), the first 25 presidents had no formal protection. The War with Spain saw presidential protection and counter-intelligence officially authorized (p.27). The prosecution of a senator and congressman for fraud led to funding cutbacks (p.32). Teddy Roosevelt transferred Secret Service agents to the Justice Dept. to investigate fraud, this became the nucleus for the FBI (p.33). As the Bureau concentrated on law enforcement, the SS kept to presidential protection and catching counterfeiters. World War I saw the SS involved in intelligence gathering, and counter-espionage (p.36). Does the plan for a German invasion of NJ sound like fiction (p.38)? Threatening a president became illegal in 1917 (p.39). The Secret Service investigation of Teapot Dome sent a cabinet officer to prison (p.41). This led to congressional restrictions on investigations, and the rise of the FBI. FDR ended the role of the SS in intelligence (p.44); he used the FBI to spy on his aides via wiretaps. Chapter 2 ends with the attack on VP Nixon at Caracas Venezuela in 1958. Secret Service men peacefully defended the Nixons (p.56). [I wonder how this all happened in a friendly country whereNelson Aldrich Rockefeller had influence?] <br /> <br />Chapter 3 tells of the tragic failure of 11-22-1963. The Treasury Dept. tried to hide information. [Melanson's claim that JFK's car slowed or stopped (p.60) is not in the Zapruder film that I saw.] Did JFK \\"flaunt\\" security or \\"flout\\" it (p.61)? Politics dominated over protection for this trip (p.63). The SS learned of the details of this trip at the last possible minute (p.66). The publicity about the route was to draw as big a crowd as possible. Did the SS agents in the Presidential detail say it was a conspiracy (p.87)? The aftermath led to an expanded and better trained Secret Service (p.91). The candidacy of George Wallace drew conservative votes away from Nixon; his elimination as an independent candidate gave Nixon a landslide victory in 1972. <br /> <br />This book has only two chapters on the history from 1865 to 1960, and skips the interesting decades of the early twentieth century. It is not well-balance. Note how Congress worried about a Praetorian Guard in the 19th century (pp.135-136). They did authorize \\"Doormen\\". Presidential protection was greatly enhanced during the Civil War (p.137). Chapter 7 tells about current operations. There are politics in protection (pp.200-201) The Secret Service operates under civil service rules, unlike the FBI 9p.195); their Director is promoted from the ranks. [But the SS does not usually investigate members of Congress.] President Nixon instructed the SS to allow a few hecklers in the crowd to provide drama (pp.214-215). JFK's personality charmed the SS, and they acceded to his request to stay off the running boards (p.285). Both Eisenhower and Kennedy were very fatalistic about assassinations (p.287). Ronald Reagan needed his 8 hours of sleep (p.289). LB Johnson was the toughest to guard (pp.290-292). Part Four ends the book, and covers the last decade. Counterfeiting could be used by terrorists (p.320). The authors argue against the dual-functions of the SS (pp.338-339). I think they are totally wrong. Protecting against fraud keeps the operatives in the Real World dealing with ordinary people; a protection only service limits their experiences. <br /> <br />The book mentions Burt Lancaster in \\"Mr. 880\\" but does not mention Sterling Hayden in \\"Suddenly\\". <br />	2005-06-30

Of her many books, this is the only one where she had personal knowledge of the perfect son, law student, social worker, and \\"trusted friend\\". Rule started writing this book before she found out that the suspect in these serial killings was her friend and co-worker, Ted Bundy. [Was he the inspiration for \\"Hannibal Lecter\\"?] Rule says there was nothing in Ted's record that could predict his future (p.xi). Yet there were incidents in his behavior: suspicion of auto theft and burglary (p.12), rifling lockers and stealing from drunks (p.14). His first girlfriend believed Ted used people and took advantage of them (p.15); she was also out of his class. Ted had other disappointments (pp.16-17). But he returned to college and became an honor student in psychology. Ted told stories to gain sympathy from a Professor (p.20). [A sign of a manipulator.] But otherwise Ted seemd to have a bright future (p.21).<br /><br />Ann Rule worked as a volunteer for the Seattle Crisis Clinic in 1971. Ted was one of the work-study students there. They both helped to save lives (p.25). Ted was helpful in his advice to Rule (p.27). Ted's slenderness disguised his physical strength (p.29); racquetball and bicycling. Rule admired him. Ted was a conservative Republican who believed in law and order; Rule never saw any anger (p.32). Ted had a \\"compartmentalized\\" life, moved in many circles where no one really knew much about him. Ted's relationship with Stephanie changed, due to Ted's bitterness. Did Ted court her so he could reject her as she had earlier rejected him (p.47)? She survived this and married someone else. After this, the first victim disappeared.<br /><br />Rule's life continued, a single mother with four children, writing reports on cases for the police, then writing stories for publication (p.49). Rule was a Deputy Sheriff in many of the counties, and spent time withvarious units (p.50). After young girls disappeared, Rule believed the killer would be a violent man, someone let out of prison too soon (p.77). Ted had a letter or recommendation from the Governor of Washington (pp.106-107). His coworkers at the Dept of Emergency Services noted his resemblance to the \\"Ted\\" at Lake Sammamish (pp.108-109). So did others (p.110). The murders in the Seattle area ceased but new murders occurred in Utah, Ted's new home (Chapter 13). But Ted failed to abduct and kill a young woman; Ted impersonated a police detective to fool this victim! After this young woman started to disappear in Colorado; some of their bodies were found (pl143). Early one morning a Utah HP sergeant noticed a VW Beetle driving by; he followed and stopped this car, and arrested the driver for evading an officer, and possessing burglar tools. Now things began to fall into place, and Rule received a phone call from Ted (Chapter 16). Those who worked with Ted couldn't believe the charges (p.157). Rule wrote to Ted in jail, and received Ted's letters. [Rule doesn't say that her association with Ted provided a powerful competitive advantage for her book.] The divorced single mother who lived off and on with Ted admittted he would leave in the middle of the night for hours, often when the girls disappeared (p.166). The police checked Ted's credit card records and telephone bills. Ted had been in the area where girls disappeared (p.175). Prison psychiatrists found Ted to be \\"normal\\" (p0.217); but he was sober then. After his second escape Ted travelled to Tallahassee FL and attacked girls at the Chi Omega sorority. (Rule had pledged to this organization - was Ted sending her a message?) A police officer noted a car coming out of a parking lot early in the morning, followed and stopped it. The suspect resisted arrest, but Patrolman David Lee caught one of the Ten-Most-Wanted. Ted's murder spree was over (Chapter 34). The rest of this book end this story, with Rule's personal experience at the trial.<br /><br />Ted's trial in Miami was televised live; was this a first? The bite marks on Lisa Levy's buttocks first linked a victim to Ted (p.397-398). Rule said Ted was found guilty becaase he fought against his defense lawyers (p.403). [Bite marks are no longer considered accurate evidence in 2013.]	2005-06-27

Borden accumulated large wealth through parsimonious thrift and \\"by means which fell within the letter of the law\\". Mr. Borden's \\"conduct in business matters had made him many enemies\\"; \\"the sharpest man in town\\". Borden was rumored to charge more for funeral services than actually provided. He raised rents for tenants who earned more. Borden's daughters did not  enjoy the fittings of their social rank. Lizzie's character was benevolent in religious and charitable work. Reporter John J. Manning said the guest bedroom was \\"not very light\\", and a body could not have been seen from the hall. One photograph shows Andrew J. Jennings peeking from the front door closet while concealed therein. The walls and ceilings were covered with hundreds of blood spots, yet Lizzie's clothing had none. The murder weapon was never found. Denying counsel to Lizzie at the Inquest resulted in the exclusion of her testimony at the trial.<br /><br />After forty years Arthur S. Phillips was the sole survivor of those who participated professionally in this trial. Phillips joined the defense team with all the enthusiasm of a new lawyer. \\"The mass of documents and other evidence collected by the defence have never been disclosed or discussed\\", because it would be necessary for any new police investigation. [Some believe this hidden history would solve the Borden murders.] A perfectly sane, normal woman without any criminal history could not hack her stepmother and father to death. Lizzie was believed guilty because no one else could have committed this crime. If Lizzie later showed a lack of mental balance it was because she lived alone, was ogled in public, and was very annoyed by public activities.<br /><br />At the time of the murders there were two strangers loitering around the front of the house with a team as seen by Mark Chase, a former assistant to the Chief of Police. Dr. Benjamin J. Handy saw a stranger acting in an unusual and agitated manner. Mrs. Sarah R. Hart also saw him. The back screen door was unfastened during the morning. Lawyer Jennings was aided by George D. Robinson and Melvin O. Adams to avoid an \\"anti-climax\\", some minor matter that could unduly affect a jury. Phillips gives an example that refuted the claim of the Prosecutor that Lizzie was not up in the barn.<br /><br />Public opinion is created and maintained by news stories and editorials in the press. The Fall River `Globe' produced stories to make Lizzie appear guilty, and that money and social position can \\"turn the wheels of justice\\". Bridget was detained by the prosecution and was unavailable to the defendant's attorneys. Andrew J. Borden was not liberal with his family, but Lizzie had $2,800 in her banks, plus textile shares and was not in want. Many children dislike a stepmother. Lizzie couldn't have committed the crime, but has been judged guilty by the classes. This is the real mystery, \\"Others had more reason to kill him\\" even if we do not know the reason for which it was done.	2005-06-27

The Mystery Unveiled? <br /> <br />The object of this book is to lead to correct opinions as to the perpetrator of the Borden Tragedy so none may fear a similar calamity, and to avert suspicion from the innocent. The public was shocked by these murders because of the circumstances of their condition. One person was indicted for this crime, and acquitted. Therefore there must be an unknown party, a villain, who committed the murders. Abby Borden was killed after 9 am, Andrew was killed about 11 am. The author assumes a skillfully wrought plan to kill and leave no circumstantial evidence. The villain must get into that house undetected, commit two murders undetected, and leave undetected. The author claims no one could have done this, and proves this assertion by his assumptions. <br /> <br />The author lays out all the known facts about the Borden home that day. Lunday creates logical assumptions for the difficulty any stranger would have to enter secretly and secrete himself in the house. But all his arguments fail if the villain had knowledge of this old house and the presence or absence of its residents. Emma was away, a very rare event. Uncle John arrived Wednesday without luggage, as if for a short visit. Abby received a note that was to draw her away. Bridget was sent outdoors to wash windows. Andrew went to his bank and returned for dinner. Only Lizzie was inside the house until before 11 am. A villain could enter with a skeleton key, or by invitation to a secret meeting. Lunday assumes that the murder was planned, rather than being the emotional reaction of an unbalanced mind. My assumption was that this meeting was to be kept secret from Bridget, hence the suggestion of a bargain sale that day. The assumptions of Lunday are refuted by the facts of that day. A visitor was brought into the house for a meeting that went awry. Lizzie, outdoors at 11 am, knew who this visitor was, but decided to keep her Father's secret. <br /> <br />Given the facts in Arnold R.Brown's book, it seems to have happened this way. [My assumptions, of course.] Uncle John drops by Wednesday to pass a message for a requested meeting Thursday morning; he then leaves. A note is brought to get Abby out of the house. But she goes to the guest room and finds the hidden visitor. Words are exchanged, and this visitor strikes Abby 19 times. Then he waits for his meeting with Andrew. Bridget was out of doors, Lizzie is in the cellar privy. Noise from the carts and horses masks any indoor noises. After Andrew returns, Bridget is sent to her third floor room, and Lizzie goes out to the backyard. Another violent scene occurs, and Andrew is struck 10 times. As the visitor leaves, he is seen by Lizzie. She knows the meeting is over and returns inside and gets the shock of her life. When the police arrive Lizzie says \\"it wasn't Bridget or anyone who worked for Father\\". She knew, but kept the family secret. The rest is well-known. After the trial, Bridget leaves for Ireland, buys property for her parents, then returns via Canada to western America. [I think Bridget was given a loan for her trip to Ireland, and would have to repay it when she returned.] <br /> <br />You may disagree with this solution, but it best fits the known facts. Thanks to Arnold R. Brown and the book he wrote a few years before his death. The only thing we know for sure is that Lizzie was acquitted, and the same lack of evidence (and motive) applies to Bridget. All of Lunday's assumed difficulties disappear given a secret meeting that went awry due to the insane actions of the visitor. <br /> <br />	2005-06-27

Rodney Kosling has money for an investigation. His hearing allows him to \\"see\\" the people passing by. An unknown young woman was hurt in an automobile accident last Friday, and hasn't returned to work by Tuesday. He wants to know why. A newspaper ad brings a key witness, but he asks for too much, and leaves. Later he returns with a name: Josephine Dell. She suffered a concussion, and wants compensation. Josephine Dell's employer has died. The $10,000 in his wallet disappeared, and Bertha Cool will try to find it by interviewing Harlow Milder's housekeeper. Due to complications, Bertha corresponds with Donald Lam for his advice. Donald points out differences in wording in the will; he also asks about the cause of Harlow Milder's death (Chapter 15).<br /><br />When Bertha goes to visit Rodney Kosling, she finds a dead body; its time for the police. Bertha finds out the likely cause of Harlow Milder's death - a poison (Chapter 19)! Donald telegrams that the original story of a car accident seems \\"impossible\\" (Chapter 20). Chapter 24 tells how Bertha Cool makes sure no one is following her, and how to hide a visit to a hotel. The information learned brings Bertha back to Kosling's home, where she discovers something, and is discovered in turn.<br /><br />Chapter 30 winds up this story with a deus ex machina ending that explains and solves the mystery. Its as if \\"A. A. Fair\\" wanted to quickly end this story without the usual dialogue. The details, like \\"parol evidence\\" point to the legal knowledge of the author. The background describes an America gone forever. People leave their doors not just unlocked but open! Where a dime is a great tip! Those were the days. It also has scenes where an automobile accident victim seems reluctant to sue (or was that just for humor?). This plot, where half the detective team is on the case and communicates by letters, echoes the scenes in A. ConanDoyle's \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\".	2005-06-25
192675:US	38002140	RLRJGD7S6BPR9	B0006AYGO0	547953078	Masterpieces of murder: An Edmund Pearson true crime reader,	Books	4	1	6	N	N	A Selection of His Best Writings	This self-serving description of Edmund Pearson tells of many murder cases condensed to around a dozen pages. Some are well-known (the murder of Doctor Parkman), others have become justly obscure. Pearson had a great reputation is in his time (\\"Preface\\"). This book gives a wide selection of his best true-crime writings as space permits. It is worth reading for entertainment, just like some novels. Pearson, like Raymond Chandler, believed in Lizzie Borden's guilt. Some of the names and references are likely to be strange to readers today. Pearson often makes assumptions about some of the cases.<br /><br />\\"Legends of Lizzie\\" lists the stories told about this Puritan maiden (found not guilty of the murders). Do they sound \\"too good to be true\\"? There is a lot that isn't covered in this chapter. \\"The End of the Borden Case\\" covers this famous unsolved murder of Abby and Andrew Borden. Only two people were home when the killings occurred. Bridget was seen outside around the time Abby was murdered, and Lizzie was seen outside when Andrew was murdered. Public opinion came to believe that Lizzie did it - in spite of the lack of evidence for this! Pearson wrote \\"The Trial Book of Lizzie Borden\\" in 1937, and publicized this story.<br /><br />In 1961 newspaper reporter Edward Radin re-investigated this case for his newspaper. He found a few contemporaries, and these interviews shed new light on Lizzie. Radin said Pearson's book was so biased as to be considered a literary hoax. (Radin also published a book on the murder cases of the wrongly convicted; Pearson could never do this.) Gerald Gross wrote an essay to counter Radin's story (which cast the blame on the innocent Bridget Sullivan). Radin's book \\"Lizzie Borden: The Untold Story\\" was \\"a small masterpiece of literary detective work\\" (p.296). Pearson believed Lizzie was guilty; his account of the trial omitted all the testimony favorable to Lizzie. The 'not guilty' verdict would then come as a shock to anyone who knew naught else.<br /><br />Gerald Gross had his solution: Lizzie and Bridget did it together! Their collusion eliminated the evidence (bloody clothing, the murder weapon, etc.). But their testimony was so varied as to preclude colluding on alibis. There are problems in blaming Emma or Uncle John; both were investigated and found to be far away at the time. Right after the murders Lizzie testified that \\"it wasn't Bridget or anyone who worked for Father\\". She knew, but kept the secret scandal from the public. The best solution published to date was from Arnold R. Brown. David Kent's \\"Forty Whacks\\" provides an over-all summary of this case. \\"The Borden case is without parallel in the history of America. It is the most interesting, and perhaps the most puzzling murder which has occurred in this country\\" (p.274). [But the Trial of O. J. Simpson may be the newest most puzzling murder case in America.]	2005-06-24

He says much of America depends on the network broadcasters for news about the world. [No mention of news about America.] Since the fall of the Soviet Union networks drastically cut back on foreign news, replacing it with sensationalistic and meaningless news. Fenton doesn't understand the purpose of this: to keep citizens ignorant of the events whether in Washington or in foreign lands. People who know little, like children, are easier to manipulate and exploit. The owners of a network can do as they please, and they please the Government that controls their money-making machine. Do Clinton and Bush really want the American people to know what they're doing overseas? Don't broadcasters want a larger audience, no matter what? Fenton is arguing for a system that would reduce profits and the credibility of the US Government, and that won't happen soon. If Fenton were serious, he would recommend short-wave radio to hear foreign broadcasts in English. But that has its drawbacks. A good solution would be a weekly newspaper devoted to foreign news. But who would own and control it? Was the foreign news broadcast back in the 1970s and 1980s all that great? <br /> <br />The bottom line is this: do the networks, and the Govt., really want us to know there were no \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" in Iraq? That the 1989 invasion of Panama was not needed for America?That \\"globalization\\" is a fraud to impoverish the American people? That Reagan and Bush I supported Osama Bin Ladin? <br /> <br />The American public was not informed ahead of time for many big stories (p.3). This is by design of the networks (p.4). The real truth is that most Americans will not waste their time listening to \\"talking heads\\" in a foreign land unless it is relevant. And that eliminates most of the background news that Fenton would want broadcast. You could ask how much of this news is shown on British, French, German, or Italian TV. Could it be that the American voter is irrelevant in a system of fixed and rigged elections, where the Corporations and the President do as they wish? Why did it take so long for the media to break the story of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib (p.10)? Has outsourcing damaged the credibility of TV news (p.12)? <br /> <br />There is no entry in the index for \\"Westmoreland\\". After CBS successfully defended itself against the General, it was sold to new owners. What changes did they make? [See pages 71-72.] Did the FBI fail to follow up the connections to the 1993 WTC attack (p.21)?. Are the network news the equivalent of junk food (p.22)? Was there really \\"a massive and damaging cutback in military and intelligence funding\\" (p.27)? Fenton summarizes the events in Russia on page 30; was this so reported on TV? Fenton says America last saw the horrors of war in 1814; he had overlooked the Civil War, the Indian Wars, even the incursion into 1916 Texas. Fenton uses \\"60 Minutes\\" as a showpiece; but you should know that the questions asked are often created in editing to add drama to the subject's answers! Fenton tells about foreign bureaus (p.65), but not of their work product. The events noted on page 81 can be best covered in a magazine article, not in a few minutes of TV. Chapter 4 documents the use and abuse of the press (p.97). Does the rest of the world get better news (Chapter 5)? \\"Voices Inside the Industry\\" say the reporting of world news is inadequate (p.143). Chapter 7 says we know little of what our Govt. is doing around the world, and its not in the nightly news. Censorship of foreign news is Washington's policy (pp.207-213). What can be done? <br /> <br />Chapter 9 has his \\"Solutions\\". Like other special-interest pleaders, he claims that what benefits him is good for the country. My experience is that 30 minutes with your local newspaper will tell you more than TV news. Your results may vary. <br /> <br />	2005-06-23
194714:US	38002140	R2NM445LJ0UMBM	0875846548	421433715	Broken Promises: An Unconventional View of What Went Wrong at IBM	Books	1	5	15	N	N	What Happened to IBM?	This book presents one viewpoint on IBM during the 1980s and 1990s. The authors claim that a choice of IBM \\"could not be faulted\\" (p.9). [Was that because IBM, unlike some competitors, did not offer kickbacks to customers?] The authors claim IBM broke its promises of high-quality technology and excellent service to customers, and job security to its employees. But no company can guarantee jobs when losing money.<br /><br />IBM's \\"incompatible small computers\\" may have deviated from the S/360 model, but followed industry standards of that era (p.11). One of IBM's mistakes was to listen to its critics (p.15), who could have ulterior motives. The world economy affects IBM (p.24). The discussion about personal computers missed the point (pp.35-40). IBM did not pioneer microcomputers and mass market them. It did give an imprimatur to what some sneeringly called \\"toy computers\\". The problem noted by T. V. Learson is common to bureaucracy (but didn't he retire then?). Did IBM really give away control of personal computers to Intel and Microsoft (p.62)? Such an opinion can only show ignorance of the history from 1976 to 1982. Chapter 5 talks about \\"loyalty\\". Can any corporation offer \\"employment security\\" (p.66) in a cyclical economy where management's first priority is to the share owners? No, but its a good idea. [The only way to guarantee job security is to be the owner-operator of your own business. But even then you can have problems.] The authors state IBM's hiring policy (p.68) but don't say how this was implemented. Did family connections ever trump this ideal? The \\"Open Door\\" policy is one way for top management to find out what is really happening, and avoid filtered feedback (p.69). Was there really no management favoritism (p.76)? Does \\"scientific management\\" work (p.77). Is \\"scientific management\\" just special pleading for the managerial class? Don't employees pay for management's mistakes (p.82)?<br /><br />The authors say IBM's big mistake was to sell equipment rather than lease it. It brought in cash which was used to enlarge manufacturing plants (pp.90-91). But this plan soon failed; they liquidated their assets and squandered the money. No mention of the Board of Directors! The authors tell of IBM engineers forming \\"their own company\\" in 1967, but not of the venture capitalists behind them (p.92). The authors say IBM failed to drop \\"poor performers\\" (p.94), but don't explain any errors in hiring practices. The author's comments on page 104 show credulity. Watson Sr. sold cash registers, which recorded and tabulated money. Hollerith cards were a more general form of recording and tabulating data. Did IBM spend too much time on executive politics rather than profit and loss (p.123)? I don't believe the authors on the F/S project failure, since they overlook customer acceptance. Did customers want another new system that would obsolete all their existing software (p.130)?  The story of Stalingrad sounds like an urban legend (p.131)! This all seems as if the authors didn't do their homework. Chapter 9 considers the advice of \\"Wall Street\\"; but Wall Street produces nothing, it profits from other people's money. Wall Street's own management is marked by failures, scandals, and mergers of failed firms. Wall Street's special pleading is listed (p.135); they have hidden agendas (p.136). Inflation is caused when the Federal Reserve (a private banking cartel) prints and distributes paper money for its purposes. The authors correctly question the wisdom of following Wall Street's advice. Wall Street can benefit by selling short, and promoting \\"high tech\\" stock to gain from a company's distress (p.149).<br /><br />Chapter 11 asks about the future of large corporations, given the reports of financial losses for many old companies (p.179). I think the authors drew the wrong conclusions about IBM's selling and not leasing; its what they did with the money. Lloyds of London had \\"great losses\\" (p.183) on computer equipment that becameobsolete. The comments on small vs. large staffs (p.185) overlooks the rate of administrators to production workers. This is called \\"bureaucracy\\" (p.187) but it could also be called \\"patronage\\". What about special relationships (like nepotism), or if personal whims decided on projects. Was there an abuse of overtime? Could an outside organization have members inside to influence policy?<br /><br />Could anti-trust enforcement have prevented the IBM debacle? When difficulties arose, IBM did split away functions (like Lexmark). Real innovation comes from a small group (p.189). You can add the 1930 invention and patent of the transistor by a long-extinct company.	2005-06-22

It comes with a CD-ROM to test your preparation for the \\"A+\\" certification, and includes a limited version of a test program. Its 1100 pages make it a handful to hold. My comments are selective, based on my limited experience. <br /> <br />The section on \\"Configuring a Modem\\" skips over the very important topic of jumper settings (for older non-PnP modems). You must analyze your PC to understand what you will need to do. Windows 95 assumes COM1 and COM2. If your computer has only COM1 you may avoid problems by setting the modem to COM3 - IRQ3. Modern computers allow you to select the COM port. Your modem can used COM2 - IRQ3 when you select COM4 for the second serial port. Some prefer COM1 - IRQ4 for the modem, and COM3 for the first serial port. Use the MSD program before you start, and find out what BIOS settings are used. Be careful if a beginner! Write or print everything before you make any changes. <br /> <br />The discussion on \\"Installing a Hard Drive\\" doesn't mention the \\"Cable Select\\" option on some hard drives. Some computers may require this setting rather than MAster or SLave. <br /> <br />When adding a sound card or modem to a Windows 95 system, first use \\"Device Manager\\" to remove any old sound card or modem from the OS. Not doing this can result in unexpected problems. You won't make this mistake twice. <br /> <br />What if a used motherboard or computer has password protection for BIOS settings or Startup? Sometimes you can use a jumper to negate this, if you have the documentation. If not, removing the battery for 10 minutes will end the password. You will have to reset the settings (or select the defaults). <br /> <br />Your local Adult High School of Community College may have a course that uses this book.

He uses the phrase \\"economic hit man\\" to describe his work as a confidence man in arranging loans that can never be repaid. Loan Shark? He says the presidents of Ecuador and Panama were deliberately killed in separate plane crashes, not by accident (p.ix). The events of 9-11-2001 caused him to publish a book he had been writing for years. Corporations, banks, and governments use their financial and political powers to spread their ideas and culture (p.xiii); but this is not a conspiracy, he says. Perkins says we must all help to change these policies.<br /><br />The 'Prologue' explains how the scam of \\"foreign aid\\" works. Money is loaned to a foreign country. Most of it is given to Big Corporations in America. When this money can't be repaid, the debtor is forced to make policy changes to further benefit the global empire (p.xvii) by exploiting the country's people and natural resources (p.xviii). These modern conquistadors are disguised to look like normal people (p.xx). If they fail, men of action (\\"jackals\\") are brought in to overthrow or kill the leaders. As a last resort the US military is sent in (p.xxi), as in Afghanistan and Iraq. If all else fails, US taxpayers will be tapped for the funds. This book gathered various topics and news to present a tutorial on imperialist exploitation that is very readable and educational.<br /><br />Part I tells of his youth, education, and early career. Perkins took courses on economic statistics, and learned that statistics could be manipulated to reach the desired conclusions (p.13). A country could be manipulated in a similar manner (pp.18-19). Perkins uses the word \\"corporatocracy\\" to refer to the corporate ruling class (p.26). [Not \\"corporatism\\"?] Part II tells of his job in Indonesia; he visited a puppet show (pp.43-44). Did Arnold Toynbeepredict today's conflicts (p.45)? [Who did he work for?] Perkins summarizes Panama's history (pp.58-60); it has a wide-open banking system (p.63). OPEC was formed in response to the power of the oil refining companies (p.76), and their attempts to keep prices down (by shifting costs to producers). Perkins notes examples of the military-industrial complex (p.79). The high prices for post-1973 oil ended up in the pockets of Big Corporations (p.89). Did Reagan and Bush support Osama Bin Ladin (p.97)?<br /><br />Part III notes how he used applied mathematics to create the desired results (p.102). Perkins supported the transfer of the Panama Canal, and tells how he benefited (p.104). Perkins went to Colombia to create massive developments and debt to exploit its gas and oil (p.122). The sweatshop factories in poor countries only increase their poverty (p.128)! Do some missionary groups work for oil companies (p.142) and swindle natives out of oil-rich lands? The firing of a superior led to Perkins resignation (pp.146-150). Part IV tells how he traveled and wrote. Then he rejoined his company for a higher wage. PURPA created laws that allowed utility companies to buy up smaller companies (p.168), and municipal water systems (p.169). Why was there an unprovoked assault on Panama (p.175)? Why was Noriega a prisoner of war (p.177)? Is globalisation the equivalent of the slave trade (pp.180-181)? After 9-11-2001, and the events in Venezuela, Perkins started writing again (p.198). Ecuador was looted and impoverished (p.203). Chapter 35 has his comments on the War on Iraq. If you bomb a country and then rebuild it, the biased \\"sciences\\" of econometrics and statistics will show great economic growth (p.216)! Perkins finished and published this book, comparing it to the warnings of Paul Revere's ride (p.218). [The vague description of events suggests smart caution; Perkins doesn't want to die in an \\"accident\\".]	2005-06-11

Levitt won an award for \\"the best American economist under forty\\". Stephen J. Dubner is a journalist. This very readable book may educate you about things you never thought about. It may also mislead you as well. The 'Introduction' asserts that the massive crime drop in the 1990s was due to the US Supreme Court's legalization of abortion in 1973. With fewer poor children, there were fewer future criminals. But this does not explain the bubble in the late 1990s stock market! Or the rising indebtedness and poverty since 1973. You have to be careful about agreeing with the stories they are telling, or selling. If morality prescribes how things should work, economics shows how things actually work.     Chapter 1 tells about cheating by schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers. The sumo wrestlers who spoke out were bumped off (p.44). Small communities have less street crime, because of social incentives (p.49). Cheating seems to be part of human nature, getting a bargain. The weather is a factor (p.49)! There is a social factor: executives did more cheating (p.50). Chapter 2 explains the KuKlux Klan as the terrorist arm of the white establishment (p.58). They oppressed those who sought a better life (p.57). The book claims the stories of \\"Superman\\" reduced membership in the Klan (p.65), but couldn't the post-war prosperity also have contributed? They then discuss the methods and language of real estate agents (pp.72-75). Chapter 3 discusses \\"conventional wisdom\\" of popular beliefs. They often come from advertising or other special interests (pp.90-93). There is a story on the economics of crack dealers (pp.93-108). Crack cocaine devastated Black Americans (pp.109-114). Shutting down factories was another cause.     Chapter 4 asked what caused crime to plummet after 1990? The authors discuss the reasons. [Is imprisonment a special form of welfare?] When guns and the homicide rates are compared, note the lack of mention of South America (p.131). [Gun buyback in 2003 New Brunswick NJ was followed by double the murders the next year!] Legalization of abortion was followed by a drop in crime (1973-1991). Early legalization states saw crime rates fall (p.140). No comment on the economic effects. Chapter 5 says there is a vast and diverse flock of parenting experts (p.147). How many have laboratory experiments for their advice? Consider the danger of a backyard pool (p.149). The per-hour death rate from driving or flying is about equal (p.151). Innovations in child safety result from marketing new products (p.153). Would school choice work? Studies suggest it barely matters (p.158). Except for those who went to a technical school (p.159). Practical skills result in a solid career. There are differences between rural, suburban, and urban schools (p.166). A high socioeconomic status suggests the family connections that help (p.168). Does Head Start help future test scores (p.170)?     Chapter 6 considers the effects of a child's name. One judge has noted the strange names of some offenders (p.180). Isn't this an effect of society's treatment of an individual? Since the early 1970s blacks have been giving unique names. The list is on pages 184-186. The effect is for job interviews, again the effect of society's treatment. There is a correlation between a baby's name and the parents' socioeconomic status (p.190). But these names shift over time. A name popular with high-income parents will be later adopted by lower-income parents. The 'Epilogue' tells of two boys from Chicago who made it to Harvard. The black boy was abandoned by his mother, beaten by his father, and a gangster in his teens. He is now a Harvard economist. The white boy had smart loving parents who stressed education. He made it to Harvard, but later left to live as a hermit in Montana. Which of them is better known (p.207)?	2005-06-07

This very readable book is partly about Greenspan’s career in government, and politics, but mostly about the economic policies of the last three decades. Batra explains how the Federal Reserve has impoverished most Americans to enrich the wealthy, and attacked the middle class to benefit Big Business.   Chapter 1 tells the real impact of Alan Greenspan, how he unwittingly effected a global crash and spread economic misery (p.5). Greenspan’s fraud swindled millions of families (p.6), while he benefited from his tax policies. Chapter 2, one of the most important, explains the fraud that was used to raise Social Security taxes in 1983 and then squander this money on tax cuts for the wealthy (p.12)! Greenspan’s fraud was that he helped to raise payroll taxes, then sought to lower Social Security benefits (p.36). Chapter 3 discusses Greenspan’s worship of “free profits” (p.48). Adam Smith was against mergers of competitors, and government regulation to restrict competition (p.50). The fallacy of Classical Economics is they could not account for depressions of falling output and rising unemployment (p.60). Batra explains the fallacy of “Supply Side Economics” (pp.68 70). Chapter 4 explains “Greenspan’s Intellectual fraud” (p.74) as deceiving an audience by using fake or selective data for monetary gain. Greenspan saved the country from a Reagan Depression in 1987 by flooding the markets with liquidity (p.91). Afterwards he raised interest rates to regain this money and prevent inflation (p.92). Chapter 5 reports the global effects of Greenspan’s policies. The 1981 tax cut led to soaring interest rates and a steep recession (p.123). Cutting the interest rate resulted in higher stock prices (p.136). The bubble of speculation inevitably burst (p.139).   Chapter 6 notes that economic theories can’t explainthe causes of a stock market bubble (p.141)! Batra says it is a mismatch between supply (productivity) and demand (wages and debt). When wages are high from productivity there is prosperity without a crash (p.143). Stagnant or falling wages create unemployment (p.146). Expansionary fiscal policies create a debt that comes due (pp.147 148). Regressive taxation and low wages create a global crisis. Chapter 7 explains how the income tax rate affects our standard of living. Reagan’s tax cuts created a giant budget deficit and high interest rates (p.169). Clinton’s raised income tax rates was followed by relative prosperity. Bush lowered the top income tax rate, which always hurts the economy and stunts economic growth (p.173). Chapter 8 documents another of Greenspan’s fraud, the claim that minimum wages create unemployment. This lie has been proven wrong since 1935. Greenspan wants increased immigration to keep wages down (p.191)! High money growth causes inflation (p.192).    Chapter 9 discusses the trade deficit, which could cause the budget deficit (p.199). A country that exports goods has a trade surplus, one that exports services or farm products has deficits (p.204). Prosperity comes from manufacturing (p.205). Regressive taxation has forced a gap between wages and productivity (p.214). A regressive value added tax makes it worse. The merger mania results from a lack of competition and the desire for monopoly control of output. Chapter 10 tells how Greenspan’s policies changed but still aimed at the economic destruction of the middle class (p.217). Most Americans have seen a drop in their living standards since 1973 (p.219). Regressive taxes, higher health insurance, and lowered pensions make it worse (p.220). The effect is rising bankruptcies, mushrooming debt, and a drastic decline in the household savings rate (p.221). Countries with ultra regressive taxes like VAT (value added taxes) experience the same slow growth and higher unemployment (p.229).Chapter 11 lists the needed economic reforms. Batra lists the top ten problems that need fixing (p.236). Returning Social Security to a pay as you go system will benefit the economy (p.240). An ethical economic policy benefits all of us, an unethical economic policy creates massive debt and increasing poverty (pp.244 245). Batra lists 6 reforms for wages and taxes to bring back prosperity (p.247). A separate export exchange rate will benefit manufacturing (p.251). Reducing the wage gap will reduce recessions, inflation, and poverty (p.253). The long run cure for economic imbalance is economic democracy (p.255). [But his proposals seem to idealistic, and lack the checks and balances needed in the real world. Batra does not mention that these regressive policies came about after Nixon’s devaluation of the US dollar in 1971.] [Read “The Looting of America” for more information.]	2005-06-06

It is also the record of balancing law and order with Britain's \\"ancient and jealously guarded freedoms\\" (p.4). Chapter 1 tells of finding a body in a car parking lot at Gatwick. In a few hours the victim was identified, the main suspect determined, and an arrest order sent to Massachusetts (p.10). The English system of policing was first left to local authorities, and the constable. Edward I and the Statute of Winchester returned police power to the people who were obliged to carry arms. In 1748 Henry Fielding, the novelist and playwright, was appointed magistrate and began the professional police force known as the \\"Bow Street Runners\\" (p.16). In 1829 Robert Peel created the Metropolitan Police for London. It quickly reduced thefts and robberies. The end of the Bow Street Runners eliminated this detective force (p.31). This was followed by creating a detective force in 1842, a plain clothes force. Page 33 tells of the Great Train Robbery (not like the film). Charles Dickens wrote about true crimes, and created England's first fictional detective in \\"Bleak House\\" <br /> <br />The author explains Sherlock Holmes' comments in \\"Copper Beeches\\" as referring to the murder of Harriett Richardson (Chapter 4). The Victorian years were marked by the most hideous crimes. This chapter tells of the murder of Francis Kent. Detective Jonathan Whicher interviewed all the household, and concluded the murderer was Constance, the older step-sister. The court and the press did not agree. Later Constance confessed and was sent to prison. Willkie Collins' \\"The Moonstone\\" was inspired by this case, and his \\"Sergeant Cuff\\" had the physical description of Sergeant Jonathan Whicher. Another story \\"ripped from the headlines\\"? Chapter 5 tells of the first murder to be committed on a train. Detective Dick Tanner followed the clues, then caught a break from a cabman. The suspect, Franz Muller, had sailed to America. Tanner left on a steamship to arrive 2 to 3 weeks before Muller. Muller was arrested, extradited, tried, convicted, and hanged. Chapter 6 has the further developments of the detective force, and some famous murder case of that era. Chapter 7 tells of \\"Jack the Ripper\\", who was never caught. Jeffers suggests an immigrant from Eastern Europe, but could he have been literate enough to write the letters? <br /> <br />Chapter 10 notes that A. Conan Doyle started the style of a private consulting detective who outperforms the police. The police journal replied that Sherlock did not have to take on all cases, street brawls to knife fights, for workman's wages with a politician looking over his shoulder. But A. Conan Doyle did investigate and solve a jewelry theft, and others (p.99). In the case of Oscar Slater, Doyle wrote that once the police picked out a suspect, they avoided looking elsewhere. Another writer, Erle Stanley Gardner, often wrote of this human error. Juries are told to wait for all the testimony before they reach a verdict. Chapter 11 tells of other physicians, the Doctors William Palmer, Thomas Smethurst, Edward Pritchard, and Neill Cream; all murdered by poison. The murder of Dr. Harvey Crippen saw two innovations: using radio to catch him, and forensic pathology to identify his wife's body (the head was never found). <br /> <br />The remaining chapters contain a selection of various crimes and punishments, and the ongoing developments of the Metropolitan Police and Scotland Yard. <br />	2005-06-04

They are still interesting novels.     \\"The Wrath to Come\\" predicted a future Pact of Nations pledged to peace and limited armaments. America was not a member. Germany and Japan were, and conspired in a surprise attack on America. Japan would use a hidden fleet and \\"flying ships\\" to attack PEARL HARBOR! Germany, allied with Russia, would attack the East Coast. Since the Pact of Nations only guaranteed peace among its members, a non-member state was liable to be attacked (would a scrap of paper prevent this?). A conference at Nice is to vote on inviting America to join; a few members plan to blackball this. There is a former State Dept. official who is now a wealthy playboy in Monaco. Slattery foils this plot by inviting a delegate for a cruise, then heading out to sea to prevent his vote. Slattery is now a secret agent!     The writing style and the culture reflect the 1920s, and cloak the realities of life that are more explicit in later decades. This restrained style has its charm. The idle rich spend time and money in Monaco, and its transient society. The gambling casino was used in WW II to arrange secret meetings: the numbers played on roulette would tell the day and time for the rendezvous to the knowledgeable onlooker without any personal contact! Ian Fleming used casinos in his stories (was \\"Auric Goldfinger\\" based on \\"Cornelius Blunn\\"?). The book also explains how the owners of newspapers create propaganda. \\"People can't help believing a thing they are always being told.\\" If somebody becomes an obstacle, they can meet with an accident. Secret agents who talk in their sleep have a fault; they shouldn't travel with incriminating documents. This book records the pre-1930s when the Secret Service was responsible for counter-intelligence. Multiple organizations may prevent good coordination     \\"The Great Impersonation\\" begins with Sir Everard Dominey wandering lost through German East Africa, and finding an outpost commanded by Sigismund Devinter, a school mate at Eton (now Leopold Baron von Ragastein). There is a remarkable resemblance between these two, and they tell each other their life stories. Both were exiled after killing a man over a woman. But the German Baron plans to kill Dominey and return to England in his stead. This will allow undercover work during the coming war to crush England! The Baron travels to meet Seaman in South Africa and find the wealth needed to carry out the impersonation.     People notice some differences in the returned Sir Edward, who cleans up the mess he left behind. His wife gets proper care and begins to recover from her long illness. \\"Dominey\\" runs into the Baroness whose husband he killed in that duel; she is not fooled and now wants to marry. \\"Dominey\\" can do nothing as this could reveal his secret and overturn his life as an English country squire. A visitor brings a warning from Africa, then disappears from his room! There is the conflict between those who warn against a war with Germany and those who seek peace. But the conflict between Austria and Servia begins; countries mobilize for war, ending the hopes for peace. At the end the impersonation is unmasked. The backgrounds provide a description of life for the English gentry and their villagers that will disappear in a generation (it reminds me of Agatha Christie's stories).	2005-05-18

Burdens were placed on people who had to learn new skills. People are valuable assets. Page 5 mentions the effects when companies started to buy computers instead of leasing them; no mention of tax laws. <br /> <br />Psychological stress results from losing a job (p.9). Those who remain are also affected, and their productivity. Full-employment companies are among the best-performing enterprises (p.15). Mills has comments on this (pp.19-20). When manufacturing ended at Boulder Colorado it was replaced with distribution and computer programming (p.33). IBM's concept of employees as those who know their job better than their manager reflects reality (p.39) [and \\"Dilbert\\" cartoons]. Chapter 3 discusses the closing of the Greencastle Indiana facility. A warehouse worker could talk to the plant manager. [A good place to work is where the managers and employees share the lunch room and facilities.] After the closing local property taxes went up (p.64). The IBM plant was given to the town in hope of attracting jobs for unskilled and semi-skilled workers (pp.75-76). The Westlake California facility was shut down, and its people moved to Boulder (p.84). A long distance move affected working spouses (p.93). Chapter 6 has empty-minded talk of \\"change\\" (p.98). People accept changes that benefit them, and avoid or fight changes that harm them. The author's definition of \\"career\\" as a series of \\"unrelated jobs\\" is phony (p.99). Mills was amazed that \\"managers and professional\\" got better jobs [then]. They bring more experience and a new viewpoint. Should a company only hire those who have worked at some other place? [You need to think this through.] A company gains by retraining and redeploying people to meet current needs (p.125). <br /> <br />Chapter 7 discusses the need for top-level commitment, and the part played by key committees in running IBM (p.131). Pages 135-137 tell of the contention process which empowers staff executives. Full employment is a measure of resource balancing. Subcontracting is used as needed, as is taking accrued vacation. Hiring standards are noted (p.141). Chapter 8 explains how IBM made redeployment work; they took action to ensure line management followed corporate programs (pp.157-159). Chapter 9 discusses in general the European laws on employment security. Mills argues against the laws designed to help employees: \\"added costs\\" (p.185). He says different state laws could make full employment \\"difficult to realize\\" (p.186). Yet all laws create costs, and benefits. What is the price for high morale (p.190)? Is it economic security (p.193)? What is the price for experience (p.194)? Mills claims \\"once America had a work force which would give commitment without expecting anything in return\\" (p.200). [What a fantasy!] Mills criticizes the practices of many corporations (p.201). Wall Street criticizes IBM's practices (p.202). Do these practices prevent a hostile takeover? [Remember, Wall Street produces nothing, they are parasites that profit from other people's money.] Layoffs have costs for a company (p.206). IBM gets long-term benefits from full employment (p.207). <br /> <br />Chapter 11 wonders about the future. One 1974 book's predictions about \\"no-growth\\" were proven wrong over the decade (p.211). Avoiding layoffs meant IBM retained its \\"well-trained young people\\" (p.213). IBM's pursuit of excellence and service to the customer are as important as ever. But Mills wonders if the full-employment policy will continue. In 1988 IBM re-organized to put operational decisions closer to its customers. Their three basic elements of management apply to every business (p.215). IBM now lacks the dominant position it once held, and this will affect its future (p.216).  <br /> <br />[This book does not mention the layoff of 5%of employees that occurred in 1970. Elephants can't dance because their wing loading is way too high.] I wonder what his next book will say?  <br /> <br />	2005-05-18

They have investigated cases where innocent persons have been wrongly convicted. His \\"Perry Mason Room\\" is dedicated to the ideals of unswerving loyalty to a client, a devotion to the cause of justice, and an indomitable fighting spirit.    This story begins in a company parking lot. Arlene Ferris can't start her car that evening, but a stranger happens by and offers her a ride. He is the son of the company's owner. Then Loring Lamont makes a detour to their country home to drop off some papers. This turned out to be a trick on Arlene, she escaped Loring's advances, and the next day consulted Perry Mason. But they find out that Loring was murdered that night, and the police know Loring was with a young woman. Mason advises his client to visit her friend, and begins working on this case. The police find Arlene and charge her with the murder.    Chapter Five tells of the problem with personal identification. If a victim looks over mug shots, and later sees that person in a police lineup, the victim will likely identify a familiar face. Some people have accurate memories, other people don't. The cross-examination in Chapter Ten focuses on the identification by two eye-witnesses. As in the real world, its who you know that can help you land a job (Chapter Twelve).    Then Mason finds that Arlene's friend got a payoff to skip town, and finds a solution to Arlene's innocence that is consistent with the known facts. \\"The function of a court of law ... is to see that justice is done\\" (Chapter Fourteen). The newly discovered facts leads to the real killer, and Arlene is freed. One of the lessons of this story is why circumstantial evidence (the clothes on the victim) is most reliable.	2005-05-14

John Kirby shows up to say he was at a sales meeting that lasted to 11 pm at night. On the way home he saw a young woman carrying a one gallon gasoline can. He gave her a lift, but her car had disappeared. So he took her to a motel, registered as man and wife, then drove home. Kirby told his wife this story, and she insisted they drive to the motel to help the young woman; but she had disappeared. And the one gallon can was no longer in Kirby's car. After Kirby leaves, Della Street now connects this to an attack on a Doctor Babb who lives in the suburbs. A young woman was seen running from the Doctor's house, and she fits the description of Kirby's rider. The name \\"Kirby\\" was found on the Doctor's appointment book. Paul Drake is called to investigate.  <br /> <br />This is another story with numerous suspects. Perry Mason soon finds Kirby's story had left out quite a few details. Before the Doctor died he mentioned his attacker: \\"John Kirby\\", but witnesses say John Kirby did not leave his car. The name of the young woman was also in the Doctor's appointment book! John Kirby is arrested, and Perry defends him at the preliminary hearing. Doctor Babb had been running a baby mill. Young women would give up their babies so a married woman could present an heir. [The implications about society are not discussed.] The records of these adoptions could provide a blackmailer with lucrative opportunities. One unasked question: could a person taking a shower in his house hear a woman scream from the next house? <br />	2005-05-14

She is given sodium pentothal and her answers are recorded on tape. During the questioning she admits to poisoning her Uncle. Dr. Denair consults Perry Mason to find out if this is confidential, or must be reported to the police. Perry points out a confession to a crime is not confidential, but the statements of a drugged person are not reliable in a court of law since they may be imagined. Dr. Denair brings Nadine Farr to consult with Perry Mason. But the nurse present at the treatment tells this to her policeman boyfriend, and the tape recording is obtained with a search warrant by the police.<br /><br />The story is that Nadine threw away the poison. Perry recovers the bottle and has it analyzed - a sugar substitute! But the police do their homework and find a second bottle with the poison. We learn that Nadine's boyfriend says he found that bottle and flushed it away. We also learn that Jackson Newburn also threw away the poison! The case goes to court, Hamilton Burger accusing Perry of substituting false evidence. This looks like a slam-dunk for Burger until Perry personally inspects the evidence and notices a detail that will clear Nadine Farr of murder, Perry of fabricating evidence, and get a confession from a witness pointing to the real murderer. The scandals that generated this crime are mentioned at the ending.	2005-05-14

Pan Eurasian Petroleum wants to get concessions from the Rumanian government, but its plans were exposed by a leftist newspaper and were suspended. PEP will hire an expensive agent to fix this problem. Kenton, an English free-lance journalist, is on a train to Vienna in search of money. A stranger on this train offers him money to carry an envelope across the border from Germany. The author's knowledge of engineering is shown by his comments in Chapter II: \\"vertical borers, milling machines and turret lathes\\", \\"all-geared head, straight bed S.S. and S.C lathe\\". When Kenton goes to the hotel to deliver the envelope, he finds the stranger has been stabbed dead. The envelope contained photographs and military secrets.  <br /> <br />Kenton was followed, and captured by Colonel Robinson's men. Beaten and threatened unless he surrenders the secret papers. Kenton knew that Big Business pulled the strings of Government statesmen. \\"Follow the money\\" is always the clue to politics. But a near miracle occurs when Andreas appears and frees Kenton. They escape through the woods. During a talk, Andreas explains why Big Business needs somebody like Colonel Robinson: to do their dirty work, and to be expendable if caught (Chapter X). Zaleshoff explains why War Plans are secret, even if prepared for a contingency. Kenton tells them where the secret papers are hidden; but there are problems. Kenton is wanted for the murder, and, masked men stole the envelope with the secret papers. Kenton leaves for Prague. He gets on a tour bus and is befriended by a British salesman, who gives his opinion on western Europeans (Chapter XII).  <br /> <br />The book describes Kenton's escape across the border into Czechoslovakia. After he arrives by train in Prague, he is escorted away by two plains-clothes policemen. They are Zaleshoff's men. Exciting adventures and events follow. The incriminating secret papers are retrieved, then destroyed. Kenton returns to his post in Berlin by train, but no longer plays poker-dice. Ambler knew how to create a story that holds your interest until the end. You can compare this story to those of Buchan or Oppenheim.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-13

No dates are mentioned, but the presence of a wounded soldier says WW II. Tire rationing is mentioned, plus the implications of owning two new tires. Doctors made house calls. Vincent Blane, store owner and banker, has two daughters. One is married to Jake Hardisty, the other is seeing Harley Raymond, a Purple Heart winner. We find out that Jack Hardisty has stolen a huge sum of money from his father-in-law's bank. Adele Blane and Harley are at the cabin when Jack arrives; they leave. When Harley returns, he later finds Jack's body in a bedroom. No murder weapon, or money. Other people are brought into this story, neighbors who could be suspects. The police are called and begin their investigation. Perry Mason is hired to defend Millicent, Jack's widow, who had been seen near the cabin and has no alibi. Her .38 revolver was found near the cabin. Was it the murder weapon?<br /><br />When the trial begins, the autopsy surgeon testifies that scopolamine was found in Jake's body. It is used as a &#34;truth serum&#34;. The estimated time of death was between 7:30pm and 10:00pm. Can the age of a person be determined from a &#34;spectacle lens&#34;? Were the other people who were around at the time of them murder just innocently passing by? Finding two revolvers complicates the case, as well as the buried alarm clock. But Perry Mason figures out what really happened. A negative in a camera is not definitive proof, unless you can be sure when it was taken. The trial is adjourned, and Millicent is not convicted. Can an alarm clock do more than tell time?	2005-05-13

Curphey, M.D., Coroner of Los Angeles County, who is trying to get legal medicine used properly. If autopsies do not use current scientific methods then crimes can escape detection, or innocent persons can be convicted of crimes they did not commit. Dr. Curphey formed the Institute of Legal Medicine to combin the medical schools, the law schools, and the police and sheriff's departments in a practical partnership.    This story is about Mildred Crest, whose world collapses when her boyfriend breaks their engagement, and confesses to embezzlement from the company they work for. Mildred goes for a ride, and picks up a hitchhiker. The car crashes and burns, but Mildred decides to assume the hitchhiker's identity - Fern Driscoll. She finds a new job and apartment, and lives a more reclusive life. But an insurance investigator shows up, and asks \\"Fern Driscoll\\" to write a statement about the accident. Mildred went from the frying pan into the fire! So now she consults with Perry Mason about a \\"personal matter\\". \\"Fern\\" tells about the crash from her point of view (Chapter Three); but Mason knows she didn't tell the whole truth. A stranger shows up, tells \\"Fern\\" a story, and Mildred confesses she isn't Fern! And this is just the beginning of this story. Then the insurance investigator is stabbed, and the police investigate this murder.    Circumstantial evidence is the best evidence, unless it is misinterpreted. Eyewitness evidence can be deadly and dangerous because there is often no corroboration for this testimony (Chapter Twelve). Whenever a person was unjustly convicted, it is usually on eyewitness evidence. Most people cannot recognize a stranger seen for a few seconds (Chapter Thirteen). Would a prosecution witness who testified falsely be liable for perjury (Chapter Fifteen)? [NO!] Chapter Seventeen has the last day of the preliminary hearing. Mason's cross-examinationbrings out the hidden facts that will clear his client. It wasn't just the ice picks that were duplicated! There is another shocking surprise, and a happy ending. Mildred Crest has all charges dismissed, current and potential. [Does part of this story remind you of \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\"?]	2005-05-13

She is picked up by a wealthy man, who drinks and drives fast. There is an accident; people are injured and one dies. But Stephane is found alone in the car, and charged with manslaughter. A friend obtains Perry Mason's help. The owner of this car says it was stolen, and has an alibi. But did he loan this car to a friend? His insurance covers a stolen car, but not one driven by him, or an agent. The investigation of the owner reveals some curious facts, derived from telephone bills (long distance). This leads to a Mrs. Warfield in New Orleans. A promise of a job brings her to Los Angeles (Chapter VII). This chapter gives an example of proper behavior in a job interview, even one designed to investigate the applicant. Mason puts detectives to work on the witnesses. But Mrs. Warfield outsmarts Mason and Drake (Chapter X)! They find the missing driver, but he won't testify in court to clear Stephane.<br /><br />Information is found that would clear Stephane. But the chauffeur becomes unavailable to testify, like the missing driver. The police and district attorney are wary of Hollywood influence (Chapter XIX). An interview in the hotel room with the widow points to the likely suspect, and confirms Mason's suspicions. Mrs. Warfield is found in hiding, and the story ends. The ending seems logically flawed to me. Its as if Gardner was afraid to offend Hollywood and the powers behind them. One interesting scene is where a person leaves their hotel room and doesn't lock the door; what a sense of security in those days.<br /><br />The ending seems logically flawed to me.

She wants Perry to attend a trial and give his conclusions. The trial starts in less than an hour, but Perry agrees to go. A young man is on trial for hit and run, manslaughter. Ted Balfour's attorney shows his skill in his cross-examination of George Dempster (Chapter Two), and Myrtle Anne Haley (Chapter Three). The problem with this eyewitness testimony is given in Chapters Four and Five. Further discussions with various people bring out the hidden facts (Chapter Nine). Investigations reveal hidden evidence and relationships. Chapter Fourteen warns against gambling with strangers, and reveals another level to this puzzling case. It becomes more complicated by Chapter Fifteen, which also tells how a family-controlled business can use &#34;business expenses&#34; to give tax-free money to family members.<br /><br />It appears that Ted Balfour will be convicted, based on the testimony of his step-mother and his company's trouble-shooter. But Perry notices a discrepancy between the victim's driver license and his fingerprints, which leads to the surprising conclusion, and a victory for his client. [The secret is similar to the one in Graham Greene's &#34;The Third Man&#34;.] This story will educate the reader as to cross-examination, where a witness is tested by opposing counsel.	2005-05-12

Three weeks later JFK was assassinated. The \\"lone gunman\\" theory was \\"designed to placate the American public and distract them from the facts of the case\\" (p.x). The authors use recently declassified federal documents to claim that the murder of JFK originated by \\"a partnership between the U.S. Mafia, the French heroin syndicate, and the government of South Vietnam\\" (p.xi). O'Leary was involved in politics for over 25 years, is president of Associated Television News, and a host of his own radio show. Seymour is a writer and author of fifteen novels. <br /> <br />John F. Kennedy never lost an election. He brought hope for a better future in a time of tumult, founded the Peace Corps, signed the first nuclear test ban treaty, cut taxes for an economic stimulus. Most of all he had charisma that few other politicians had. But Vietnam would overshadow his policies. The Vietnamese fought against foreign domination for centuries. Millions died during the WW II famine when Japan supplanted the French (p.4). But the Viet Minh were able to defeat the French and gained freedom for part of their country (p.5). Later America replaced the French as rulers of South Vietnam. Diem became the new ruler (pp. 8-9). But this new ruling class created a rebellion among the rural farmers (p.11). Ngo Dinh Diem acted like a new Hitler, persecuting the majority Buddhists using violent means (p.12). All this was possible because of American money, guns, and lawyers. Was such persecution also done by Winston Churchill (p.13)? <br /> <br />Chapter 5 explains how the Ngo family became important to opium exports to Marseilles, which became heroin for the U.S. Mafia. Chapter 6 explains how the turmoil in 1963 South Vietnam led to the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem. They were killed to silence them (p.30). Diem was put into power during Eisenhower's first term (p.39). The authors believe that JFK would have acted like LBJ (p.51). Many books, and Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\", have educated Americans about the problems in the Warren Commission Report (p.53). This Report was \\"designed solely to mislead the American people\\" (p.55). Many, many books have been written to try to solve the assassination; some are listed in the Bibliography. <br /> <br />Chapter 9 starts with declassified document 632-796, about the deportation of Jean Rene Souetre, who was in Dallas on 11-22-1963. France wanted to hold Algeria and its oil fields, but was pressured by America to allow others access (p.67). De Gaulle used SDECE to neutralize the threat from the OAS (Chapter 11). Chapter 15 tells how heroin was imported by concealment in automobiles. Chapter 16 tells how a government tolerated heroin production in return for favors. Chapter 18 presents the story of Christian David: Marseilles gangsters shot JFK. Chapter 23 presents the truth about JFK and Cuba (p.145).  <br /> <br />The authors claim of a Saigon link to the assassination is plainly wrong, and avoids the fact that JFK canceled a trip to Miami in October, before the coup in Saigon. I think it would take many months to plan a successful assassination (p.147). Blaming Saigon assumes that a puppet can pull the strings (p.150). The authors' claims are exaggerated (pp.152-153). Colonel Pavlotsky's solution doesn't explain the cover-up (pp.154-155). The 'Afterword\\" discusses related topics. It seems to be the best part of this book.

In his mid-30s he began to write detective stories, and became successful enough to make a new career. While traveling abroad in Turkey he was introduced to the Chief of the Secret Police. Colonel Haki told him about finding a body, and Charles asked to visit the mortuary for the experience. Intrigued by the history of this Dimitrios, Charles decided to follow the trail and act as a detective. Dimitrios escaped Smyrna in August 1922 and went to Sofia, Belgrade, Paris, Lyons, and other places. The police knew of him, but can't prove anything. Then his body was found in Istanbul. Charles Latimer traveled to these places to try to learn something. One unforeseen fact is that it is dangerous for a literary person to get involved with criminals; they don't appreciate the interest shown in them! But a Mr. Peters offered to help him in his research by referring him to a retired businessman in Geneva. Charles Latimer should have found a cause for alarm when told he had valuable information, but didn't know what it was! But he continued his journey without any fear.<br /><br />Chapter IX tells how a spy gained the friendship and confidence of a clerk in a government ministry. The clerk needed the money after he lost at a rigged card game. Peters told how he smuggled heroin to France in a coffin, but that couldn't be done regularly. The end of Chapter XI reveals the secret of Latimer's knowledge. [This is similar to Graham Greene's story \\"The Third Man\\".] Mr. Peters will profit from this knowledge. Their last meeting ends with rough justice. Charles Latimer decides to set his next mystery in an English country village. The ending seems unreal, forced by the need for Latimer's survival.	2005-05-09

Pan Eurasian Petroleum wants to get concessions from the Rumanian government, but its plans were exposed by a leftist newspaper and were suspended. PEP will hire an expensive agent to fix this problem. Kenton, an English free-lance journalist, is on a train to Vienna in search of money. A stranger on this train offers him money to carry an envelope across the border from Germany. The author's knowledge of engineering is shown by his comments in Chapter II: \\"vertical borers, milling machines and turret lathes\\", \\"all-geared head, straight bed S.S. and S.C lathe\\". When Kenton goes to the hotel to deliver the envelope, he finds the stranger has been stabbed dead. The envelope contained photographs and military secrets.  <br /> <br />Kenton was followed, and captured by Colonel Robinson's men. Beaten and threatened unless he surrenders the secret papers. Kenton knew that Big Business pulled the strings of Government statesmen. \\"Follow the money\\" is always the clue to politics. But a near miracle occurs when Andreas appears and frees Kenton. They escape through the woods. During a talk, Andreas explains why Big Business needs somebody like Colonel Robinson: to do their dirty work, and to be expendable if caught (Chapter X). Zaleshoff explains why War Plans are secret, even if prepared for a contingency. Kenton tells them where the secret papers are hidden; but there are problems. Kenton is wanted for the murder, and, masked men stole the envelope with the secret papers. Kenton leaves for Prague. He gets on a tour bus and is befriended by a British salesman, who gives his opinion on western Europeans (Chapter XII). <br /> <br />The book describes Kenton's escape across the border into Czechoslovakia. After he arrives by train in Prague, he is escorted away by two plains-clothes policemen. They are Zaleshoff's men. Exciting adventures and events follow. Theincriminating secret papers are retrieved, then destroyed. Kenton returns to his post in Berlin by train, but no longer plays poker-dice. Ambler knew how to create a story that holds your interest until the end. You can compare this story to those of Buchan or Oppenheim. <br /> <br />	2005-05-09

In England a production engineer loses his job due to the slump. After months, Nick Marlow decides to apply for a job that requires \\"fluent Italian\\". This company specializes in high-speed shell production for cannon. After Marlow arrives in Milan, he gets a visit from General Vagas, who says he was a friend of Ferning (Marlow is his replacement). Marlow reports to the Police for his residence permit, but peeves signor Capitano. Then he meets another businessman, Andreas Zaleshoff, who shows him a picture of Ferning, and offers advice, which Marlow spurns. Chapter V tells how to recognize the old-fashioned method of steaming open envelopes to read the letter.     Marlow meets Zaleshoff for dinner and is put wise to the situation. Ferning was murdered because he worked for Vagas; counter-espionage did this to avoid publicity. Marlow would be in danger if he accepted Vagas' offer. Vagas pays off important people so he is untouchable. Now Zaleshoff explains why Marlow should take Vagas' offer! Marlow is attacked and beaten by four men, it is only a warning.    But the secret deal with Vagas is exposed to the authorities; an overlooked human factor did something. Now Marlow has to flee, and he is helped by Zaleshoff. They begin walking cross-country, and hiding in the brush when necessary. This escape keeps your interest. The details about disguises and changing clothes are informative. Marlow gets his bonus from Vagas and returns to England. He then changes jobs.    This story follows the plot of \\"Background to Danger\\". A man gains important and dangerous knowledge while performing his job. He escapes by a long flight through the countryside until he crosses the border to an adjoining country. Later novels avoid this plot. This adventure story serves as a lesson the defense industry and politics that you won't find in your newspaper.	2005-05-09

Each did something to improve the production of wheat, meat, maize, or the hidden hunger (vitamins). This book is written in an up-beat style that moves along. But it has the outlook of the 1920s. <br /> <br />Mark Alfred Carleton brought Kubanka wheat to the American Northwest (p.3). He proved that different grains have different diseases. The wheat that best withstood the extremes of climate made the best bread. The best wheat wasn't the highest yielding, but what best withstood the weather.  <br />Angus Mackay brought the new early-ripening wheat to western Canada; it withstood the frosts. Dry country needed raising a crop every other year, and leaving the land fallow. Cross-breeding Red Fife and Hard Calcutta created \\"Markham\\", its descendants were named \\"Marquis\\" and proven best for the western Canadian provinces. <br /> <br />Marion Dorset researched the problem of hog cholera. He had invented \\"Dorset's Egg Medium\\" for the Tubercle Bacillus. Pigs that survived cholera became immune. Dorset discovered the disease was a virus, not a germ. Dorset's serum saved 96% of the treated pigs.  <br />John Mohler investigated the foot-and-mouth sickness, a virus that would pass through porcelain filters. It was spread from cattle cars on the railroad, prowling dogs, and crows. Any herd would be destroyed if only once case of disease was found. Deer can spread the disease. The cost of this slaughter is less than the cost of a country-wide outbreak. <br />Edward Francis discovered Tularemia, a disease that affected farmers in the harvest season (\\"deer-fly fever\\"). Animals died with an infected liver and swollen spleen - like bubonic plague. It could kill or weaken humans. It spread from the meat or skins of infected animals; by lice in the wild. <br /> <br />Chapter 6 explores the work of the ancient and anonymous breeders of maize, the principal food of people in the Americas. Maize is most dependent on man, it does not grow in the wild. James Reid created Yellow Dent corn from Little Yellow and Gordon Hopkins; he gave it away, unpatented, and his widow died poor. It tells how Henry A. Wallace calculated the worst looking ears of corn had the best yield by weight. <br />William James Beal cross-bred White Dent and Yellow Dent to get a hybrid that produced 50% more for the first year. Discoveries rise from the needs of men. George Harrison Shull experimented with breeding corn and developed high-yielding maize. <br />George Hoffer was a botanist in Indiana who was asked to diagnose ailing corn; it came from diseased stalks. He found the kind of soil made a difference for growing corn, and, too much iron can cause molds. The cure was potash, as needed. A corn stalk is tested with various chemicals to diagnose the problem. <br /> <br />Stephen Moulton Babcock analyzed the food for cattle as to protein, fats, sugars, starches, and minerals. He invented a test to measure butterfat in milk, and didn't patent it. His live tests showed maize superior to wheat as feed for cattle.  <br />Harry Steenbock, and others, discovered that sunlight prevented rickets (soft bones). Sun-lamps were a substitute. Bathing food in sunlight captured this substance, found in cod-liver oil.  <br />Dr. Joseph Goldberger worked for the US Public Health Service and investigated pellagra (a disease of poverty). Those who had fresh milk and meat didn't catch it. Fresh protein food prevents or cures pellagra. This simple finding was not accepted by others. Since pellagra wasn't infectious, the rich and powerful didn't care about a cure which could cost them in higher wages. Dried brewer's yeast was a preventive. <br />	2005-05-05

His clients are always exonerated. The entertainment is in the search to uncover the truth that will free his client in a surprising ending. Gardner tells facts about the laws and other new developments. The monetary figures date these stories. Prosecutors must provide exculpatory evidence (Brady Rule), and the use of &#34;third degree&#34; methods are now only found in old films. [Or are they?] Forensic sciences has made great advances. Just as fingerprints could be forged or planted (Sir Harry Oakes murder trial), also DNA evidence (OJ Simpson). Human error is always with us. Read these novels to learn why Gardner outsold his competitors in his lifetime.<br /><br />These novels warned against invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. While ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (before or after the crime). &#34;Perry Mason&#34; advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer. There is a famous true crime that has the above elements.<br /><br />“The Case of the Fenced-In Woman” is about disputed property in a divorce. The woman had a barbed fence installed inside the home to limit her husband. He claimed a relationship between his wife and the contractor who installed this fence. Then the body of the contractor is found in the husband’s side of the house.<br /><br />&#34;The Case of the Reluctant Model&#34; is about the disputed provenance of a painting. A dead body is found in the client's apartment, her revolver is the murder weapon. A witness provides evidence to solve themurder and free Perry's client.	2005-05-02

Her employer has given her a suitcase to deliver to a locker. Janice believes this is blackmail money. Perry takes her as a client, and gives her legal advice. Della Street will accompany her when she makes a delivery (Chapter 1). Perry calls Paul Drake to have an operative follow the man who picks up the letter with the key to the locker (Chapter 2). The next morning Janice calls with the news that her employer Morley Theilman has gone missing, and a detective has been there to look for him. They find that the suitcase has gone missing from the locker (Chapter 3). Perry explains how this trick works (duplicated keys). The police are investigating Theilman's disappearance, and question Paul Drake and Perry Mason, who know little (Chapter 4). So Perry Mason now begins to investigate this event with the help of Paul Drake. Perry talks to the current Mrs. Theilman, and gains information (Chapter 5). Now Janice Wainwright can't be found, and they discover the real name of the second Mrs. Theilman (Chapter 6). Perry discusses and summarizes the problem with Della (Chapter 7).<br /><br />Perry and Della fly to Las Vegas to surprise Janice; Paul Drake tracked her down. Now a shocking surprise occurs at the train station (Chapter 8). Janice apologizes to Perry and explains what she did. Then Lt. Tragg shows up to question Janice about the murder of Mr. Theilman (Chapter 9). When Perry tries to find Mrs. Theilman he finds that she was led away by a police officer. Perry then finds Mrs. Theilman and tries to question her, but the police show up and order him to leave the state (Chapter 10). Chapter 12 instructs the reader on the techniques used to match tires to tire treads. It shows the cross-examination of a medical examiner. Chapter 14 has another important cross-examination that negates some of the circumstantial evidence against Perry's client. This dramatic story continues to its conclusion by Chapter 17.<br /><br />A \\"shadow\\" is the term for a person who follows another. Like his other books, there is a description and implied criticism of the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Parts of this story read like they came from a gossip column.

No cause of death can be discovered after examining the vital organs. Popular belief blamed it on witchcraft. Or was it a \\"perfect crime\\"?<br /><br />Perry Mason gets a call from a new client, but she can't come in because she has nothing to wear. All her possessions have been stolen while she was sunbathing. Della Street brings her an outfit, and Arlene Duvall tells her story. Her father was sent to prison after being convicted of stealing a money shipment. He was convicted on circumstantial evidence; the money was never found. Arlene hires Mason to find her missing trailer and car. Paul Drake quickly finds the missing trailer, and explains how this is done in Chapter 3. They mention the terrible traffic in Los Angeles (after the destruction of the trolley system). Perry Mason explains to the trailer dealer what constitutes a legal agreement. Arlene hires Mason to investigate the crime and free her Dad. Mason says he will serve justice first; if he Dad is guilty he will get his fee from the reward money.<br /><br />Mason meets with Jordan Ballard, who worked with Colton Duvall at the time of the theft. Ballard asks for a lift home, and tells Mason the background facts. Mason leaves, and checks in with Paul Drake to learn the police were called after Ballard was found murdered! Arlene Duvall was followed, and seen entering Ballard's house just after Mason left. Mason then goes to see Dr. Holman Candler, the good friend of Arlene. The urgency of this situation forces Mason to work through the night. Next morning Mason appears before a grand jury to answer questions about his activity at Ballard's house. The District Attorney wants to charge Mason with perjury, or murder! (There is a lesson her against making assumptions about an action that can have many meanings.) Arlene Duvall is arrested for murdering Ballard, and Perry Mason will have to defend her.<br /><br />As part of this story you will learn about some detective techniques and parts of the laws. A number of funny things happen on the way to the trial. Since Mason's clients are always found 'not guilty' there's no surprise there, but in the journey to this conclusion. The suspense lasts until the final pages when Perry Mason draws the facts together to solve the murder, and the earlier theft of the money shipment. Mason warns against the frequently made mistake of first deciding who was guilty and then fitting the facts to prove that guilt (Chapter 14). I won't give away the ending, but it implicitly warns against assuming that something could not have happened.	2005-04-28

Dr. Camps is the co-author of \\"Practical Forensic Medicine\\". Too many murders have been diagnosed as suicides, and suicides as murder, because of a lack of medical knowledge and pathology.    Carter Gilman was eating breakfast and reading the newspaper. He asked his daughter Muriell to cook another egg and sausage. When Muriell brought this to the dining room she found Carter had disappeared without a word. But he left a note asking for Perry Mason to be called in case of any emergency. When Muriell finds hundred-dollar bills scattered on the workshop floor, she calls Perry Mason; he arrives as quickly as possible. Later that morning Perry Mason has a new client; Edward Carter (who is Carter Gilman). Edward Carter says he is a friend of the Gilman family and wants to prevent Nancy Gilman, Carter's wife, from being blackmailed by a Las Vegas private detective. Perry Mason assigns Paul Drake to investigate. A few hours later Mason receives a phone call from this Las Vegas detective, Vera Martel, who warns him to stay out of this case. Mason realizes there are a lot of assumptions and coincidences in this case, and he needs to recheck the stories that he is being told.    Paul Drake follows a daughter to Las Vegas, and uncovers startling news about a missing heir or heiress. Then they hear more shocking news about Vera Martel: murdered, and made to look like a car accident! The police arrested Carter Gilman on suspicion of murder. Then the police show up to question Carter's wife and daughters. Perry Mason advises them to tell the truth or say nothing, and to not volunteer information. Mason then interviews Hartley Elliott, who was a visitor that morning.    The Preliminary Hearing takes up the last third of the book. There is enough evidence to try Carter Gilman. DA Hamilton Burger wants to indict Glamis Barlow, Carter's stepdaughter, as an accessory to murder. Perry has a very difficult situation and little time to solve it. Mason receives a subpoena, and the news that Muriell has told all to DA Burger. Hartley Elliott will also testify. Mason is surprised to learn the source of the found hundred-dollar bills. Paul Drake calls with more information on the activities of the murdered private detective; his man on location will fly in with the results. This newspaper photo of an engagement helps Perry Mason to question a witness and crack this puzzling case. The last chapter gives the hidden history, and why the murder occurred after a double-cross. Like some other stories, this reveals the scandals in the hidden lives of the rich and famous. [Careful consideration of earlier testimony could provide a clue to the false testimony.]	2005-04-27

Paul Drake quickly finds the missing trailer, and explains how this is done in Chapter 3. They mention the terrible traffic in Los Angeles (after the destruction of the trolley system). Perry Mason explains to the trailer dealer what constitutes a legal agreement. Arlene hires Mason to investigate the crime and free her Dad. Mason says he will serve justice first; if he Dad is guilty he will get his fee from the reward money.    Mason meets with Jordan Ballard, who worked with Colton Duvall at the time of the theft. Ballard asks for a lift home, and tells Mason the background facts. Mason leaves, and checks in with Paul Drake to learn the police were called after Ballard was found murdered! Arlene Duvall was followed, and seen entering Ballard's house just after Mason left. Mason then goes to see Dr. Holman Candler, the good friend of Arlene. The urgency of this situation forces Mason to work through the night. Next morning Mason appears before a grand jury to answer questions about his activity at Ballard's house. The District Attorney wants to charge Mason with perjury, or murder! (There is a lesson her against making assumptions about an action that can have many meanings.) Arlene Duvall is arrested for murdering Ballard, and Perry Mason will have to defend her.    As part of this story you will learn about some detective techniques and parts of the laws. A number of funny things happen on the way to the trial. Since Mason's clients are always found 'not guilty' there's no surprise there, but in the journey to this conclusion. The suspense lasts until the final pages when Perry Mason draws the facts together to solve the murder, and the earlier theft of the money shipment. Mason warns against the frequently made mistake of first deciding who was guilty and then fitting the facts to prove that guilt (Chapter 14). I won't give away the ending, but it implicitly warns against assuming that something could not have happened.	2005-04-27

He takes a vacation on the French Riviera, and brings his Zeiss Contax camera to take photographs. When his roll is finished he brings it in for development. There is a problem when he comes to pick it up: it has pictures of a restricted naval base at Toulon. The police question him, and discover that another camera had been switched for his. Vadassy is stateless; he was born in a part of Hungary that was turned over to Jugoslavia. While a student at the University of Buda-Pesth his elder brother and father were shot by the Jugoslav police for their involvement in politics. The French police demand his cooperation, or he will be deported back to Jugoslavia. Vadassy must inquire among his fellow guests to find the person who also has a Zeiss Contax.    The rest of the book tells of his experiences with the other 12 guests at the small hotel. Vadassy must report his findings to the police each day about the cameras and other events. Vadassy talks to these guests and learns more about them, at least what they tell him. Chapter 13 has the story of Herr Heinberger, more realistic that the story of \\"Victor Laszlo\\" of \\"Casablanca\\". The plan of the police works, and the real spy is traced to his employer. Vadassy will become a French citizen, and discovers some truths about the other guests. They were not what they seemed.    This was Eric Ambler's first successful novel. Like his other novels, it shows the struggle of one person against the power of a state, and his survival. The 'Footnote' for the 1951 edition says the Sumerian rulers of Mesopotamia were using undercover operators thousands of years before Moses sent spies into Canaan. Yet spy stories were only published in the early twentieth century. Detective stories were first published in the mid-nineteenth century. I suspect that society was mostly rural or in small town, and did not have the big cities that need detectives, or the imperialism that needed spies.	2005-04-22

The Anglo-Turkish Treaty meant a trip for him, and he enjoyed travel. The deal was closed, and Graham will leave the next morning. The company's representative takes him to a local nightclub. Someone watches him, then leaves. When he returns to his room, shots are fired at him. It was an attempt at murder, to sabotage the armaments deal. For reasons of personal security, Graham will return by ship. Colonel Haki shows Graham photographs of suspects, and Graham recognizes the man who was watching him.    The ship docks at Athens. Mr Kuvetli asks Graham to show him around Athens. When they return, Graham finds a new passenger, one that he has seen before. Graham had been given a revolver for his protection, but he left it in his suitcase. When he decided to carry it, he found that it was gone. The enemy agents know he is defenseless, and can succeed either by stopping or delaying him. The German agent makes him an offer he can't refuse: die now, or take a 6-week vacation! But the latter choice means he would disappear without a trace, solely dependent on the mercy of his enemies. Firing a bullet into a gasoline tank acts as a deus ex machina. Of course, the good guy wins in the end. The individuals encountered in this book all have their little secrets.    Ambler's novels feature an individual struggling against the powers of a state, and surviving. This 1940 story must have been written during the Sitzkrieg of 1939-1940. His novels were adapted to movies but are not available.	2005-04-19

John Douglas solved unusual kinds of crimes done by those who kill or rape or torture because they enjoy it. Profiling requires \\"creative-type thinkers\\", not accounting or engineering types. They must work well both alone and in groups. They need good judgment based on instinct, which can't be defined in an objective nature. Douglas says serial killers are mostly made, not born. Most come from broken or dysfunctional homes, and are victims of some type of abuse. Real-life killers were used as models for \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", \\"Red Dragon\\", and \\"Psycho\\". The modus operandi is what the offender does, the signature is why he does it (that doesn't change). Virtually all multiple killers are male. Chapter 2 gives an example of solving murders where there was only a vague eyewitness description. <br /> <br />Chapter 3 shows many examples where profiling was used to describe the habits of killers. Chapter 4 tells of more cases, some of which will never be dramatized for TV as they are too horrible. Chapter 5 deals with pedophiles. One warning sign would be a man whose house has games and amusements that appeal to children. Chapter 6 tells of the possible dangers to young children. One example is the murder of Megan Kanka. It doesn't tell you that her murderer was released from prison against all advice because a new governor wanted to cut costs. Fast footwork by propagandists made it appear to be the fault of the parents since \\"they didn't know\\". I wonder if this law affected the crime rate? Chapter 7 tells of the Collins family; its too long. Chapter 8 tells of the murder of Suzanne Collins, a sad tragedy. Chapter 9 tells of the after-effects on Suzanne's parents, and their support group. Chapter 10 is about the savage murder of a wife and her two girls. It established the use of criminal profiling at trials. Chapter 11 tells about the crimes of a rapist-murderer near Arlington Va. [Was this the inspiration for Patricia Cornwell's \\"Post Mortem\\"?] When they noted a 3-year gap in the crimes, they looked for someone who had been in prison for burglary; they found a likely suspect. This suspect was convicted, the first person in the world to be executed on the basis of DNA evidence. <br /> <br />Chapter 12 is about the unsolved murders of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. John Douglas was not called in by the police and the prosecutors, but has formed a strong opinion of the case. [Ever notice how many people's opinions are set by the first news and can never consider the facts in the case?] Note that his discussion of the attack omits the fact that two different knives were used (autopsy report). Douglas talked of the \\"widespread conspiracy\\" argument, but didn't read Steven Singular's \\"Legacy of Deception\\" which tells how a journalist in Denver got news about the LAPD! The timeline says O. J. Simpson is innocent. The limo driver arrived at 10:22 and saw no one enter or leave until the 11pm trip to the airport. Any evidence like a glove or blood drops had to be planted the next day. Ron Goldman was 5'9\\" and 175 lbs. His unexpected visit to Nicole's place put him in the wrong place at the wrong time. Nicole had been involved with another man who was 5'9\\", 175 lbs, but a few years older. In the dark the killers attacked the wrong man, then the witness who came out of the house. If her boyfriend then went into hiding, then that would confirm this theory. <br /> <br />Chapter 13 gives the authors views on crime and punishment. Rehabilitation which makes a good guy out of a bad guy is best. But some offenders can never be rehabilitated and must be isolated from society. Capital punishment prevents the worst from recommitting their crimes. But the problem is to be sure those convicted are truly guilty. Criminals are manufactured from a poor home life. [But isn't this the result of poverty in many cases?] The problem is apparently without a practical solution. <br /> <br />	2005-04-14

It didn't start in Nazi Germany, and didn't end in Abu Ghraib (drugs, electroshock, gags, garrotes, blindfolds, branding irons, sexual abuse, mock executions).

Dieting doesn't work for most people. Extreme obesity is a serious disease. Obesity increases the occurrences of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes. Diabetes increases the risk of coronary heart disease. Fatness can't be cured by reduced food intake. A low amount of saturated fats and higher amounts of complex carbohydrates, with regular exercise, can reduce the risk factors for heart disease. The fear of fat has caused epidemics of anorexia nervosa and bulimia among young women. The prejudice against overweight can cause depression, which is worse than being overweight. While more people are overweight than 50 years ago, they are also living longer. The problem with being fat may be in our attitude towards it. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 says fat, in most cases, is not a health hazard and weight loss is not a generally desirable ideal (p.16). Fat is stored energy (after glycogen). While the body can use fatty acids for energy, the brain can only use glucose. Protein can also be used for energy, but is self-destructive. The 20th century fashion for slenderness contradicts thousands of year of human experience (p.19). Ideal weight tables are meaningless by themselves (p.21), but demonstrate credulity. The body-mass index is a created metric that is a guess (p.23). Body weight is relative, not an absolute ideal. Only extreme levels of fatness can be considered a health hazard: you can see this from 50 yards, no measurement needed. Atrens discusses the social factors that make you fat (pp.27-39). The increase in fatness follows a shift to a continuous supply of food (modern life). Urbanization has an affect on fatness, as does social class. <br /> <br />Page 68 explains why \\"dieting is a health hazard\\". The diet industry is Big Business and lucrative for magazines and publishers. Sound nutritional practices should notbe ignored by counting calories. Exercise is good in itself, even if it doesn't lose weight. Converting fat to muscle affects volume, not weight (p.71). Smoking to lose weight is a cure worse than the disease (p.72)! Chapter 3 notes that fatness indicates intake is greater than expenditure; you must overeat or underexercise (p.73). Eating at night is more likely to result in fat (p.80). Humans are getting both fatter and healthier at the same time (p.83). <br /> <br />Chapter 5 discusses the various diets to reduce fatness. But fatness is not necessarily due to overeating, and undereating does not necessarily lead to slenderness. Atrens comments on the low-energy diets, the no-energy diets, low-carbohydrate diets, liquid-protein diets, and lunatic-fringe diets. The failure of these diets is due to \\"very powerful basic biological forces\\" (p.116). Failed dieters are the norm. Carbohydrates are the main ingredient of human diets. Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver (p.126). Typical Western diets have far too much fat in them. The composition of a diet is important to overall health status (p.128). Chapter 7 discusses the many, many quack dieting schemes that enrich their vendors. Chapter 8 summarizes this book, but you should read the preceding chapters to understand the background. It is also the longest chapter. People could have benefited from this book if they read it thirty years earlier. Atrens mocks the vitamin C recommended by Linus Pauling \\"of Nobel Prize fame\\" because of \\"a large-scale controlled study in the San Francisco area\\" (p.226). [Using vitamin C worked for me, even with smaller amounts than Pauling recommended.] The San Francisco case may not have the temperature range of the NY area, or the dust and pollutants from western lands. <br />	2005-04-11

There is talk by some to prepare for the next war by military training in college. From that, Sinclair Lewis builds a fantasy 1936 election between two fictional candidates: Walt Trowbridge and Berzelius Windrup. &#34;Buzz&#34; Windrip is a chameleon of a politician who easily adjusts to any audience. [Was he modeled after Huey Long?] But a lot of the references mean little to those born after 1965. Buzz's campaign speech is a clever parody of real politicians: he wanted high wages and low prices, etc. Chapter 8 has the &#34;Fifteen Points of Victory&#34;, which may be as satirical today. The fifteenth point creates an Imperial President. [How close are we to that today?] The oratorical skills of Windrip suggest another Wilson, or maybe a Hitler (Chapter 9). Many of the details are now obscure (Chapter 11). Chapter 13 gives the author's opinion of the many reformers who sought a better world. Chapter 17 explains how this Corporate State was organized, and how it controlled and exploited most of the workers, who were now in &#34;labor camps&#34; (company towns?). The resulting inflation allowed Big Business to pay off old debts cheaply, and doubled their wealth (Germany in the 1920s?). Promises made to the people are deferred, then forgotten. A physician who protests the arrest of Doremus Jessup is summarily shot, and his property confiscated; his wife and child left homeless.   The story continues with Doremus Jessup seeking to oppose the rule of Windrip. He starts to print pamphlets (Chapter 26). A modern state, by controlling the press, various associations, and the armed forces, can dominate the population better that in medieval days. The mismanagement by the Corpos is measured by the increasing poverty of the people (Chapter 29). Finally, the Minnie Men come and take Jessup away(Chapter 30). Jessup is beaten, then given a virtual life sentence. &#34;Every action has an equal and opposite reaction&#34; said Newton. Effingham Swan discovers this in Chapter 33.   As happens with other criminal gangs, personal conflicts lead to changes. &#34;Buzz&#34; Windrip is deposed by Lee Sarason. Next month Lee Sarason was shot by Secretary of War Haik, who became the new Chief. Haik becomes a Puritan Emperor after purging the administration (Chapter 35). Changes at the camps gave Jessup a chance to escape (Chapter 36), and then cross the border to freedom in Canada. There was a story about Mexican bandits invading a Texas town - when everyone was away! This meant war. But an unanticipated rebellion occurred against the Corpo regime, and split the country. Jessup will be sent back as a secret agent (?) to organize resistance. In the last page Jessup is awakened so he can flee a Corpo posse, and continue the struggle for freedom. Like other dramas, the question of success is left unanswered. This is worth reading, even if as out-of-date as &#34;Looking Backwards, 2000-1887&#34; or &#34;The Iron Heel&#34;. They give different views of a possible future. Perhaps the first novel on this subject was &#34;Caesar's Column&#34; by Ignatius Donnelly.   Why “it can’t happen here”? Because there were no infringements on the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. The people could protest effectively any attempts at an Imperial President (who acts for the Big Corporations). Is that still true today? I hope so. This story was inspired by a true event, the attempt to stage a coup d'etat during Franklin Roosevelt's first term. The plotter picked a charismatic but patriotic Marine General who denounced the plotters. The promise of “higher wages and lower prices” seems to have inspired the Fair Tax movement, another fraud; it is self-contradictory.	2005-04-08

He learned about the forthcoming invasion of Russia 5 years before it happened. Later he was in charge of the Enigma code breaking operation - The Ultra Secret. Winterbotham first went to Germany in 1934 as an official who had important connections. Hitler did not want war with England, and would boast of Germany's powers in order to keep England neutral. Winterbotham would gather this information to warn the military and politicians of this future danger.<br /><br />Chapter 1 tells of his experiences as a flyer in the Great War who was shot down, captured, and imprisoned. Chapter 2 tells of his joining the Air Ministry. Winterbotham had a law degree, had been a pilot, spoke good French and reasonable German. In addition to technical details, he had to learn about the political and military intentions of Germany. He visited Berlin in 1934, and wondered about its resurgence (Chapter 3). That resulted from the failure of the Allies to occupy Germany and purge its ruling class, who soon wanted another turn at bat. The German Army, controlled by the aristocracy, acted as a political force that affected the government. In Chapter 4 Winterbotham explained that his friendship with top Nazi leaders gave him influence for meeting with lower ranks (p.63). At one school 12-year olds were taught how to attack on a battlefield (p.75). He explains the theory of the Aryan master race (p.76). Chapter 5 tells of his meeting with top Air Force and Army officers. He learned in 1934 of the plans to attack Russia with lightning speed (p.83). This would require a vast armament program (p.89). In Chapter 6 Winterbotham explains the need to talk to the new pilots (p.93), and for wider contacts (p.94). In WWI the airplane was introduced for reconnaissance, but the Germans would use it for a superior fighting force (p.95). Page 100 explains the technical information that was wanted. He explains the problems with divebombers (pp.103-4).<br /><br />Chapter 7 tells of his visit to the Middle East, where he observed the old irrigation canals in Mesopotamia that were destroyed by the Mongol invasion (p.113). They calculated the number of bombers from the number of air crews (p.119). Big bombs produced shock waves that shattered buildings like a small earthquake. The British depended on their Navy for protection (Chapter 8). Aircraft and tanks were minor details. They were warned about the Hitler menace, but disregarded it (p.127). The failure to contest Hitler's occupation of the Rhineland in 1936 resulted in another war (Chapter 9). Winterbotham returned to Germany to learn more about their aircraft. A successful dictatorship must have both an internal and external enemy (p.140). The British Empire was successful because it mostly did not interfere with the religion and customs of the conquered (?). He learned the most by just listening (p.143). The &#34;vast majority&#34; of Germans supported Hitler and his promises for a better life (p.146). The vast rearmaments were not for defense.<br /><br />Chapter 10 tells of his visit to East Prussia, where he saw an amber mine (p.159). The rapid production in Germany slowed due to shortages (p.162). If Germany was to attack Russia in 1941, that meant the Western campaign must be finished in 1940 (p.171). Winterbotham wondered what would have happened if Britain expanded their Air Force years earlier (p.187). Could that have saved France? Chapter 13 answers that question (p.189). It also tells how they were able to photograph from 20,000 feet (pp.194-195). Other airplanes continued this work, identifying German tanks ready for the 1940 Blitzkrieg - but the French disregarded this information (p.201). High-altitude photography avoided the wastage that occurred in World War I (p.202). In Chapter 14 Winterbotham says the Munich pact gave Britain a year to prepare for the Battle of Britain (p.204). Was it really a mistake? Afterthe start of the war Winterbotham was put in charge of the decoding of German messages (p.211). This, and radar, allowed the successful use of a smaller force against a larger attacking force. Winterbotham's comments implicitly tell about his political views.e war Winterbotham was put in charge of the decoding of German messages (p.211).

Chapter 7 gives his \\"Perspectives\\" on solving murders. A national computer database can warn against serial killers (p.336), but only if it is used. Is there money in the budget? There is a need for an independent laboratory for processing evidence so its reports can be trusted (p.337). [Read \\"Tainting Evidence\\".] But this would create political problems when the authorities want a specific finding. The authors criticize \\"conventional wisdom\\" (p.339), but this is really just how the media plays the news. Can a federal agency control this flow of news? Does it do so now?     The 'Introduction' tells how \\"modern behavioral profiling and criminal investigative analysis\\" is used to determine the identity of unknown offenders. [Did this predict the shooter in the Virginia-Maryland area in October 2002 was a middle-aged white blue-collar worker?] These predictions require a faith in a technique that is new and may not stand the test of time. It uses subjective means rather than objective means that can be independently and objectively tested. Who can read the mind of a person? [Why didn't they catch the BTK killer of Kansas City earlier?]     Chapter One deals with \\"Jack the Ripper\\", one of the first and most infamous serial killers. Douglas tells of the methods he uses to analyze these crimes. He discusses the murders, and the suspects, then describes the likely murderer (pp.79-80). We'll never know. Chapter Two is about Lizzie Borden. Most people know very little of this case beyond the jingle. Lizzie was correctly found 'not guilty' of the murders, and the case was never solved. Pages 81-102 summarize the facts. Douglas' analysis on pages 103-109 touches all known suspects. His solution shows his assumptions, and suggests he hasn't done his homework in reading the available books on the Borden murders (p.112). His strategy on pages 115-6 is hilarious to anyone who has readthe books on this case. Just because \\"no outside suspect had surfaced\\" (p.310) is no reason to blame Lizzie.     Chapter Three is \\"The Lindbergh Kidnapping\\". Unlike the previous chapters, it was solved in a court of law. The baby was tucked into bed before 8pm. Around 9pm Lindbergh heard a strange sound. When the nurse checked on Charlie at 10pm, he had been kidnapped. \\"The dog did nothing in the night.\\" By 10:25 the Sheriff and State Police were notified. By 11pm statewide roadblocks were in place (p.125). The house and floor plans had been well publicized (p.127). Meetings were arranged between \\"Jafsie\\" and \\"John\\"; after the ransom money was paid they took plaster casts of \\"John's\\" footprints (p.151). On May 12 they found the body of a badly decomposed body (p.153); it was identified as Charlie. Who planted six of Brinkert's business cards in Violet Sharpe's room (p.157)? One of the ransom bills was traced to Richard Hauptmann. He was arrested, tried, and and convicted. Hauptmann claimed innocence until he was executed. Controversy over the verdict continues to this day. It seem impossible for a carpenter to go 2 years without replacing a chisel (p.174)! Douglas discusses Rail 16, but doesn't mention that this board was thicker than the other floorboards (p.177). Douglas believes the facts point to more than one person involved in this crime (pp.179-180). Hauptmann couldn't have done it alone (p.183). Douglas mentions that \\"John\\" said the servants were innocent, according to Condon. But could that have really occurred (p.185)?     In Chapter Five Douglas explains why Albert DeSalvo was not the Boston Strangler (pp.262-265). He describes many suspects, but doesn't try to solve this crime. Could one man have killed them all \\"from older women to younger ones\\" (p.265)? We'll never know.	2005-04-05

All German agents who were sent to Great Britain were captured; they either worked for the British Secret Service or were executed. This activity involved the cooperation of many branches of government (p.viii). This cooperation was the one essential condition for success.

This book was published to offset the bad publicity suffered in the fifties and sixties (p.xvi). Page 49 says the German spies dropped by parachute were \\"an easy prey\\", and could not make radio contact \\"because of defects in the instruments themselves\\". I think this implies the British had a mole in the Abwehr who cleverly sabotaged their radios.     One of the reasons for this system was \\"to get evidence of enemy plans and intentions from the questions asked by them\\" (p.58). Chapter 5 gives many examples, such as the American Questionnaire which asked detailed questions about Hawaii and Pearl Harbor in August 1941 (p.80). Page 85 tells of Plan Midas, a successful money laundering operation where Nazi money paid for British counter-espionage! Chapter 8 notes that sending information back to Germany via double agents meant that the enemy would not send in other agents (p.108).     Deception was best assured by preventing dangerous information from being passed on, not by passing misinformation (p.110). They passed on facts which lead the enemy to deduce false intentions.

German blunders were due to Abwehr officials profiting from their agent, and could not honestly judge the agent's work. Another is the fact that espionage in wartime is difficult and usually unprofitable; counterespionage is comparatively easy and yields satisfactory results (pp.187-190).

In April 1973 he was told about \\"the true Lindbergh Story\\". Scaduto never believed in Hauptmann's guilt from childhood, and his later experiences as a police reporter. His three years of research convinced him that Hauptmann was innocent of the kidnapping and was executed as a scapegoat for a cover-up. This very readable book explains his initial investigation and background in Chapter 1. Scaduto tells about the murders of Dr. and Mrs. Nimer (pp.20-26), and how it influenced his approach to this case. Chapter 2 summarizes the kidnapping, and how this story overshadowed the real economic and social ills of that time. It helped to sell radios (p.36). Pages 43-44 tell how the upper class readily used organized crime when it suited their purposes. <br /> <br />The first ransom note was photographed and copies of it were distributed to identify its penmanship (this would allow forgery). After the body of a child was found, Parker asked if it could have decomposed so much in 72 days (p.65)? If the child was killed when kidnapped, why no bloodstains? There was a difference between the folding of bills passed earlier, and those in Hauptmann's possession (p.98). Anna Hauptmann gave Richard his alibi for the two days (p.104). Lindbergh's identification of Hauptmann convinced the jury of his guilt (p.124). The problem in this is described on pages 125-127. The plaster cast of \\"John's\\" footprint didn't match Hauptmann (p.137). The problem of handwriting experts is explained (pp.142-143); they're not infallible. The ladder found at the Lindbergh home was made by an amateur, not a skilled carpenter (p.167). Was Hauptmann investigated in 1933 and cleared by his handwriting (p.171)? Page 180 explains the trick use of a 3/4\\" chisel by Koehler. Expert witnesses testify for the side that pays them (p.182). Could Hauptmann's employment records have been tampered (p.189)? The judge reviewed the facts of the case against Hauptmann (p.219). The jury quickly found Hauptmann guilty, but were delayed by considering a recommendation of mercy (p.220). Scaduto wonders about the search in the attic; could it have been delayed (p.227)? <br /> <br />Chapter 12 tells of the abduction of Paul Wendel, and his confession to the kidnapping. The baby slept (p.243). To find another man guilty of the crime would damage the career of the prosecutor, and others (p.253). This story should enlighten you to the politics of justice. Could Wendel have just made it up? Everything he said was known to the public (p.261). An affidavit told where Hauptmann was on March 1, 1932 (p.280). Was there corroboration for this? There is a \\"retraction\\" on page 283. Scaduto examined the copies of the employment records (pp.284-285). There was a problem with eyewitnesses Perrone and Condon. Chapter 15 lists the problems with the original description of \\"John\\" and Hauptmann (pp.310-311). Chapter 16 tells of other discrepancies in the record. Could there have been collusion among the investigating authorities (p.340)? Hauptmann's financial records were suppressed (p.347). Hauptmann did not have any ransom money until after Fisch died (p.363). Did the note left in the nursery differ from the other ransom letters (p.370)? Did it imitate a German style (p.377)? Was Rail 16 manufactured evidence (p.382)? Chapter 17 concludes that the evidence against Hauptmann was perjured or manufactured (p.400). Chapter 18 tells how Hauptmann offered to take \\"lie detector\\" and truth-serum tests (p.415). Nothing prevented his execution. Chapter 19 has his interviews with Mrs. Hauptmann, who lived long enough to read this book. Chapter 20 tells how Isidor Fisch had the ransom gold notes in November 1933 (p.459). Chapter 21 tells of Jonathan Kwitny's article on how a mafioso profited from major land deals when the NJ Dept. of Transportation purchased lands. What bank was the silent partner? David Wilentz's son was also a lawyer and politician. As Chief Justice of the NJ Supreme Court he was adamantly opposed to capital punishment. This may be the Final Verdict on Hauptmann.  <br /> <br />When you read this or any other book watch how they deal with the most important clue. Whoever had the Lindbergh Baby's sleeping outfit was the kidnapper and killer. Do they treat this as a minor detail? <br /> <br />	2005-04-01

Byrd (D-W.Va.) has been in Congress since 1953, and the Senate since 1958. He was a majority leader, and third in line for Presidential succession. This book was written in 2003 to warn against the dangerous policies of the Bush administration (p.9). The 'Introduction' says the attacks of 9-11-2001 transformed a \\"lackluster, inarticulate, visionless president into a national and international leader, nearly unquestioned by the media\\". Senator Byrd did not leave the Capitol then, and fought against the abandonment of the people's liberties in the aftermath (p.13). His study of history and the US Constitution taught him the need to maintain \\"checks and balances and separation of powers\\", and oppose power-grabbing by the presidents (p.14). <br /> <br />Chapter One reminds us that George W. Bush is \\"a child of wealth and privilege\\" who did not have the experience of the ten Presidents who preceded him (p.19). President Bush won a narrow disputed victory and pushed tax cuts for the wealthy that created a huge deficit. Chapter Two says the Executive branch never sleeps; its a bureaucracy that is constantly affecting people (p.37). Chapter Three says the power and independence of Congress is based on its control over the purse (p.58). \\"If there is no check on the presidential use of funds we have, in effect, a monarchy\\". Historical examples are given (pp.60-61). This gives power to the elected representatives of the people (p.62). Allied with this is ensuring money is spent as allocated. Page 63 gives a bad example of a slush fund. Senator Max Cleland lost both legs and an arm in Vietnam; he lost his seat by opposing Bush's plan to repeal civil service protection (p.70). The ending pages warn us of an executive shadow government (p.79). The intelligence briefing of August 2001 \\"warned of terrorists trying to hijack airplanes\\". <br /> <br />Chapter Four discusses Senate Joint Resolution 23, an open-ended authorization for using military force. The idea of\\"prevent\\" became \\"preempt\\" to give President Bush more powers (p.88). Senator Byrd visited Afghanistan in 1955 (p.92). Afghanistan fought against invaders since Alexander the Great. Washington provided arms and money to help the Taliban come to power (p.96). [No mention of its importance in heroin production for the drug cartel.] Chapter Five tells about the conflict between the Senate and the Homeland Security Dept. over accountability. There was confusion at the Capitol on 9/11 (p.103). President Bush had no idea what was in the proposal (p.106); he was \\"ineptitude supreme\\". The plan was a huge merger of 22 agencies of over 170,000 federal employees. This created chaos and confusion (p.107). Changes would allow cronyism and damage worker's rights (p.108). Units and functions could be ended even if this disregarded laws (p.109). Page 111 lists the defects in Homeland Security. But protection was not adequately funded (pp.112-115). It also avoided many of the legislative reforms passed after Watergate (p.117). These policies of Bush seemed to echo the Nixon administration (p.119). <br /> <br />Chapter Six says Bush's claim of \\"preemption\\" was \\"radical having no basis in existing law\\" (p.137). He compares Bush to JFK's actions in 1962 [not \\"1961\\"]. Did Iraq have chemical and biological weapons? Reagan's administration gave these weapons to Iraq (p.149)! Chapter Seven says Cheney was quite naive to think that attacking Iraq would create popularity for America (p.155). Saddam invaded Kuwait after informing America (p.159)! The Tonkin Gulf Resolution is a warning against open-ended authorization to this day (p.170). Chapter Eight explains why \\"the common people don't want war\\" (p.178). Page 184 explains why US military action would create hunger and disease in Iraq, and destroy roads and bridges. The Senate shirked its duty (p.185). Senator Byrd spoke out against the planned war (p.187). He lists the problems that followed the victory (pp.199-203). Bush spent millions in Iraq, rather than in America. [No competitive bids?] Destroyed buildings can be rebuilt, but Constitutional liberty may be gone forever (p.208). <br /> <br />The 'Epilogue' mentions that the Presidential Daily Briefing of August 6, 2001 warned about plans to attack withing the US (p.209). The power to wage war must be returned to Congress. <br />	2005-03-28

The 'Introduction' says they want to present the findings from scholarly journals to contradict the propaganda in the corporate media (p.14). Concealed handgun carry resulted in a reduction of violent crimes (p.17). This fact is censored from the corporate media, even though thousands of lives could be saved. The corporate media portrays gun owners as subhumans, but exempts the Rockefellers, the DuPonts, and the publisher of the 'New York Times' (p.18). This is just bigotry. The availability of guns does not cause murders; murderers mostly have criminal records (p.21). Most murders are drug-related. Gun Prohibition only disarms honest people, just as locks only bar honest people. Historians and scholars say the Second Amendment is an individual right, and this was well recognized prior to World War II. <br /> <br />Chapter 2 tells of the propaganda campaign that uses various medical groups as pawns. Their studies ignore any facts that don't agree with their desired conclusion (p.33). These Gun Prohibitionists assert falsehoods, fabricate statistics, and falsify references, to forge evidence for their views (p.34). Page 38 gives examples where Dr. Tanay and Kr. Kellermann quote references which disprove their opinions! Such articles show intellectual confusion, ignorance of facts, omission of facts, and emotions that suggest a need for therapy (p.39). Freud said fear and loathing of guns is a sign of sexual immaturity and neuroticism (p.38). A neurosis is a mental disorder characterized by anxieties, compulsions, obsessions, or phobias. The criminological evidence refutes the claims of the medical advocates (p.51). The dishonesty of the \\"health advocates\\" on gun control is shown by their disregard of falling accidental gun deaths while the numbers of guns owned were rising (p.57). Are they using the idea of dying children just for its emotional impact (p.58)? The Gun Prohibitionists suppress facts, and falsify data and statistics, in order to prove their case (p.63). The CDC admitted to assuming a conclusion then creating evidence to prove it (p.69). This chapter documents the emotional anti-gun agenda in some medical and public health literature. They generally ignore the large amount of sociological and criminological research (p.83). Violence could be reduced when poverty is reduced. <br /> <br />Chapter 3 explains why \\"gun control\\" proposals are aimed to prohibit the right to own firearms. Gun prohibitionists can't be trusted. Freud said the fear and loathing of firearms was sexual hysterics (p.109). Their strident advocacy of gun prohibition reflects their neuroses. Their emotional diatribes are the reason for their failures. <br /> <br />Chapter 5 discusses distortion of gun issues in the mass media which provides most information to people. This information is shaped or biased to provide a conclusion by excluding certain information. This results from the policies of the \\"owners of media corporations\\" (p.174). But most consumers can recognize these slants. Page 192 tells how CBS' \\"48 Hours\\" faked a story. The evidence of news media bias for \\"gun control\\" is that gun control advocates never complain about the play (p.203)! No national news corporations are against \\"gun control\\" (p.204). Media manipulation of information in general has been documented in books (p.205). This message is widespread and one-sided (pp.206-7). This results in a poorly informed public. <br /> <br />Chapters 6 & 7 reference other articles that are not included in this book. They are not for the average reader. Chapter 8 explains why the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights refers to a right to personal self-protection (p.343). The need for an armed citizenry was explained by Aristotle, Machiavelli, Locke, Montesquieu, and Blackstone. Self-defense is the most basic of rights (p.345). The general possession of arms is a positive social good (p.348). Blackstone said the subjects of England had the right to petition for redress of grievances, and, lastly, the right to have and use arms for self-preservation and defense (p.349). Possessing arms is a sign of a free citizen. A republic needs armed property-owner, said Machiavelli (p.350). Despots disarm people to render them helpless, and morally degraded (p.351). No twentieth-century military can suppress an armed popular national insurgency. <br />	2005-03-26

Two members of a small gang stop at a rural gas station / lunchroom. A reporter stops by, and chats with a gang member. This reporter is covering the \\"Blandish shindig\\", where Miss Blandish will be wearing a very valuable diamond necklace. Then she and her boyfriend will visit a roadhouse. Bailey, and his boss Riley, plan a highway robbery to steal this hard-to-fence diamond necklace.<br /><br />They stop the car to steal the necklace. Miss Blandish's boyfriend tries to defend her, and is shot and killed. The gang decides to kidnap the heiress, and drive away. But when they stop for gas, the members of another gang, bigger and more dangerous, see them and later figure out they kidnapped the heiress. The Grisson gang will follow the Riley gang and hijack the heiress. The Riley gang will not be able to complain. [Would a gang that just murdered a man give up so easily?] Now the Grisson demands a million dollars in used bills, and gets it. But they renege, and keep Miss Blandish for her utility.<br /><br />This story, interesting in itself, has little redeeming value. While fictional, it echoes the crimes of the 1930s: the kidnaps in the Midwest (and elsewhere), the gang wars, the society of that day. There is little mention of politic, or the corruption of local government. The idea of wearing an expensive necklace to a roadhouse seems unbelievable, except as a hook for this story. But it serves as a warning against foolish actions, and the destructive use of drugs. A small company is put out of business by a larger company, and then falls before a more powerful organization. [The word \\"blandish\\" means \\"pleasing, alluring, enticing\\".]  Some have compared this to the kidnapping of Patty Hearst.	2005-03-25

This impressed him enough to pick this subject for his next book. Other books were on miscarriages of justice. Kennedy is against the death penalty (but for euthanasia!?). He used the recently opened case archives in Trenton for this book. The 'Introduction' tells the reader what to expect from this very readable book.<br /><br />Part One is a short biography of Charles Lindbergh. [It does not tell you that his Congressman father opposed the private banking cartel known as the Federal Reserve System.] Lindbergh's love of practical jokes suggests a flawed personality. Part Two tells of Richard Hauptmann. In the war he learned to do whatever it took to survive. Lawlessness increased after the war. Hauptmann burgled and robbed and was caught and sentenced. His adventures showed quick-witted daring. Hauptmann reported for work at 8 am, March 1, 1932. After work 5 pm he went home, then picked up his wife around 8 pm (p.80). Part Three explains what happened after the baby was kidnapped. Two sets of footprints were found leading from the ladder. The Lindberghs decided to stay over on Tuesday morning, so the kidnappers were either very lucky or had inside knowledge. After a ransom note arrived, $50,000 was given to a man in a Bronx cemetery. Then the body was found near the home. Part Four tells of the continuing investigation, and Hauptmann's life and friends. The Lindberghs lived as happily as possible. One of the ransom money bills led to the capture of Hauptmann.<br /><br />Part Five notes the methods of the investigation of Hauptmann. Kennedy explains how a witness is prepared to identify a suspect (p.176), and criticizes their methods (p.177). But Hauptmann often lied (p.178). Pages179-182 explain how the ransom note was forged: Hauptmann was forced to copy the note with its mistakes! There is implausibility in removing a plank from the attic (p.212). The fingerprints on the ransom note and ladder did not match Hauptmann; his shoe size did not match the footprints (pp.213-4). Page 216 tells how they found an eyewitness. Rail 16 was 1/16\\" thicker than the attic flooring (p.220)! Page 226 explains how evidence disappears when it challenges the prosecution's case. Part Six explains the actions of the Prosecution. Evidence was fabricated (p.242, 244). Defense lawyer Reilly was crooked or crazy (p.242). The trick with the ransom note is on page 276. The study of handwriting is an art, not a science (p.277). A chisel was removed to incriminate Hauptmann (p.295)! The \\"expert\\" witnesses impressed the jury. Part Seven tells of the efforts by the Defense lawyers. How could a professional carpenter make such a ramshackle ladder (p.309)? Page 314 tells how Wilentz threatened a defense witness. Rail 16 had \\"only one nail hole\\" after the kidnapping (p.317)! The other facts to prove it didn't come from the attic are on page 319. The jury found Hauptmann guilty in the first degree (p.344). Part Eight lists the efforts to overturn the sentence. Hauptmann's lawyers argued against the unreliable testimony of witnesses. The Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed the verdict. Given the evidence, the verdict was correct. Hauptmann \\"collected the ransom money and was therefore the kidnapper\\" (p.363). Governor Hoffman was advised that the trial was flawed, and Hauptmann was not guilty (p.366). Hauptmann pointed out the flaws in the case (p.367). The Court of Pardons would not commute his sentence (p.377). The evidence against guilt is on pages 383-384. There was a problem with Rail 16; it didn't fit (p.389)! The 'Epilogue' has the aftermath of the case. Page 409 tells of Lindbergh's gullibility on the German air force; or was it his fascist sympathy?<br /><br />Kennedy says Hoffman \\"failed to win re-election as Governor in 1938\\" (p.408). Governors then were limited to one term of three years (as in most other states). The neighboring county is Warren, not \\"Warner\\" (p.241). One important clue in this case was the baby's pajamas; whoever had them took the baby. Where is this mentioned?	2005-03-22

Its human nature to listen to gossip that pretends to give you secrets. Sometimes these facts can't be corroborated easily. So when you read these articles, consider that they may be one-sided. But you have to be one-sided to correct a widespread error. Anyone who's had years of experience with events in the news has figured out \\"you are being lied to\\".  <br /> <br />The 'Introduction' mentions the censorship about various events. The contributors of these articles do not necessarily agree with each other. That is a sign of \\"objectivity\\", not printing to fit. The articles will challenge or educate you, they shouldn't bore you. You can decide which you like better. You are not likely to find them in your local newspaper or national magazines. <br /> <br />The first article \\"Burn the Olive Tree, Sell the Lexus\\" is a good overview on the disastrous policies of globalization. Arianna Huffington writes a good report on \\"Drug Companies\\". Is this why her column is no longer printed in NJ? Jonathan Levy's article will not be found in your local newspaper; stories like this are too hot to handle. Dominick Armentano's essay is an example of sophistry; don't believe him. It denies the history of the late 19th and early 20th century. Lucy Komisar explains how corporations and the rich avoid taxes by using secret offshore bank accounts. Taxes are for the middle-classes. Noreena Hertz tells how globalization has impoverished more people than before. <br /> <br />Mike Males' discusses the \\"Myths About Youth\\". They are not more violent, homicidal, criminal, suicidal, or smoking and drinking more. They are in general more responsibly behaved than their Baby Boom parents (p.115)! Special interest groups, like the Carnegie Corporation, are pushing an agenda to convince people that more repression is needed. Many of their claims are false and deliberately misleading, like \\"injury and violence have now replaced illness as the leading cause of death for adolescents\\". Many fewer teens die from the infectious diseases common before the mid 1950s! The truth is that poverty correlates to the problems of teens, but this fact is banned by the politics of those spreading fears. It would require changes that they don't want to discuss (p.118).  \\"Toxic TV Syndrome\\" by Kalle Lasn explains why watching TV makes you sick: the more you watch, the more depressed you become (p.142). <br /> <br />David T. Hardy reports the truth about the Waco Incident, when the ATF raided a communal church (p.183). It debunks the story in the Corporate Media.  William Blum presents the censored facts about the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, \\"a mass of conflicting evidence\\" (p.190). Peter Gorman tells of the secret coup that overthrew the President of Peru, and how this relates to another secret war to seize control of the coca fields of Colombia. Are there hidden oil fields there? <br /> <br />Russ Kick explains why 9-11-2001 was not a surprise: there were many warnings that something was going to happen (pp.241-257). In Manila 1995 they found plans to hijack a commercial plan and crash it into CIA headquarters, the Pentagon, the White House, the Sears Tower, the Transamerica Tower, or the World Trade Center (p.246). Crashing a plane into a Tower was attempted in December 1994 (p.247). Were telephone calls being intercepted (p.249)? [But some of these stories sound like \\"urban legends\\" (p.253).] Was this attack as big a surprise as Pearl Harbor? <br /> <br />Howard Bloom's article on the Chinese Century is must reading! J. T. Gatto's hidden history of American education is very important for your understanding on how the system works. Before WW I \\"the Education Trust\\" was created to attack the middle-class of owner-operated businesses (p.274). Future generations were to be trained as economic serfs for the big corporations. Children would be deprived of the traditional education learned in farms and villages, and be told of what to think. Schools were like factories that took in raw materials and shaped them into finished products (p.275). The hidden policies created a rise in school violence and chaos due to the process of restricting the ability of teachers to control and discipline children. This created a market for drugs for kids. Big corporations would control schools and children, not the family and church (p.277). The literacy rate for soldiers in WW II, Korea, and Vietnam kept dropping; this measured the \\"dumbing down\\" in the education system (p.278). This was due to the \\"whole-word method\\" (p.279). Was the schooling of the masses aimed at destroying democracy (p.285)? Were today's high-cost, low-value schools created for big corporations (p.286)? What will be the effect of well-educated people who can't find work (p.287)? Can the perverse education philosophy of the last century be cured and corrected? Can we afford anything else? If illiteracy causes crime and violence, doesn't that make our schooling system responsible (p.279)? <br />	2005-03-21

McCoy, and the others listed in the 'Preface'. It takes place in Washington DC. Ronald Malcolm works for the \\"American Literary Historical Society\\", and reads detective and mystery novels to summarize its plots for his employer. One day their new accountant tells Malcolm there is a discrepancy in the records; of seven crates shipped from Seattle only five crates arrived in Washington. This had not been noticed previously. The accountant reports this loss in a memo.    Malcolm reports to work on Thursday. It is his turn to go out for sandwiches for lunch, and he uses a basement exit for a short-cut. He also runs an errand. He returns to find the front door locked; he has to use his key. Then he finds that all of his co-workers have been killed by professional assassins. Malcolm leaves the building and calls the \\"panic number\\" from a public phone to report the maximum damage; he is told to disappear and call back later. When Malcolm calls back, he is told to make contact in an alley of a Georgetown theater. But his rescue team takes a shot at Malcolm, who fires back, escapes, and goes to ground. Will Malcolm be rescued by he CIA or found by the killers? And who is the double agent?    After you read this novel you can better understand the film, which is a simplified and condensed version (called \\"Three Days ...). The story was changed from drug smuggling (to censor drug references?), and relocated to NY city. This story seems implausible to me, since eliminating the one link in Seattle would avoid the furious investigation that would follow a massacre of seven in Washington DC.	2005-03-17

Six Days of the Condor, James Grady<br /><br />The events in this novel are fictitious (`Preface'), but could be actual. The factual background came from Jack Anderson's newspaper column and these books: \\"The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia\\", \\"CIA: The Inside Story\\", \\"The Invisible Government\\" and \\"The Espionage Establishment\\".<br /><br />The story starts on a Wednesday in Washington DC. A small building houses the \\"American Literary Historical Society\\", a privately funded organization that analyzes mystery novels and other literature. This is a government funded operation of the Intelligence Division. It is a rainy April Wednesday; Heidegger asks Malcolm if he noticed any missing books. Seven crates of books were shipped from Seattle but only five crates were received there. Heidegger sends out a report on this discrepancy (but it is intercepted). On Thursday morning Heidegger did not report for work.<br /><br />Thursday morning was rainy and Malcolm went out for sandwiches by a concealed back door. A team of men entered the ALHS by following the mailman. When Malcolm returned he found his co-workers were strangely silent. Malcolm borrowed a revolver and left the building to dial the special number of the Panic Line. He is told what to do. Malcolm kept this appointment but is surprised. Later Malcolm found a safe refuge with Wendy for the night, and became friendly with her. On Saturday Weatherby died unexpectedly in the hospital. A mailman has a package for Wendy. On Sunday the authorities learn more about the dead men and their link to a third man. They realize they have a \\"fairly highly placed leak\\". What about those missing books?<br /><br />On Monday Malcolm phones the Agency to exchange information. Later he and Wendy tour the Capitol. Two men across the street see them. Shots are fired, police converge on the scene but don't stop the men. \\"All Hell has broken loose.\\" Malcolm found another place to hide. On Tuesday Malcolm goes to the address for a Maryland license plate. He wrote a report and mailed it to his bank for re-mailing. The Agency brought in a psychological diagnostician to study Malcolm. Malcolm borrowed a car and drove to that Chevy Chase address. He saw two men approach this house. He then entered through an open window, then is captured! They inject a truth serum and question him. When he awakes he learns the facts behind the plot, and why he is given these facts.<br /><br />On Wednesday Malcolm went to the National Airport to search for this last man. He followed him to a rest room to get private justice for Wendy. Then he telephoned a number to come in from the cold. The loose ends are tied up, the press is given a cover story to explain the last death. There is a happy ending, and Malcolm will get a vacation. What next?<br /><br />The movie made changes to this story. Was it in some ways better? The location was changed from Washington DC to the recently completed World Trade Center in New York city. Was this an example of product placement?	2005-03-17

Barney Adams, the VP of investigations for an insurance company, shows up for an important and delicate investigation. Someone is advertising for witnesses to an auto accident in a newspaper. Such witnesses could affect the insurance settlement. The insurance company wants to know who is behind this scheme. Lam notices something about his business card. So another investigation begins. Lam meets another witness for this ad, and takes her to lunch. She has a sad story to tell: she met a man and married him; the man took all her money and left her. Lam advises Daphne Creston not to get involved in this business, but she doesn't listen. So now the complications arise in this case. An important lawyer is murdered, and the police find Lam driving in the neighborhood. Daphne Creston knows how to give a false address, enter an apartment house, wait, and then leave to shake a tail. Does she know too much (p.93)?    A \\"telespotter\\" senses the electronic impulses from a dialed telephone and records the number. Lam explains why two cabs are needed to follow a suspect (p.107). The police said the murdered lawyer had large sums of money, and dealt with lobbyists who could \\"get results\\". This lawyer was involved with many important politicians in the state. Lam finds more complications in his investigation. Could he have stepped over the line this time? Chapter 11 tells how to send a letter so it can't be traced by anyone following you. This fast-moving story will hold your interest to the last page. It will educate you about the various scams that you will seldom read about in your newspaper.

Lam meets Starman Calvert, gets the photo negatives and a receipt for the money (a confession), and leaves. But when he tries to deliver the goods a new mystery develops! Nicholas Baffin thanks Lam & Cool by giving them a free meal, and they invite Sergeant Frank Sellers. Gratitude, or for another reason? We soon find an unexpected development at the dinner party, with a chance for scandal. Will an eyewitness use his imagination for details his eyes never saw? Donald Lam is in a predicament.    Lam begins his detective work in Chapter 9, and finds the credit card slip for Mrs. Starman Calvert and car license. It tells how a small-town girl like Connie Alford could be lured to Hollywood through a contest created by a promoter for merchandising. In Chapter 10 Lam is told that the dinner was planned to allow for hidden photography, and this witness is scared. Lam then meets with newspaperman Colin Ellis, who is very well informed, but can't print it all without proof (Chapter 12). Chapter 14 tells how witness statements can be arranged to create the desired story. Lam continues his investigation, and takes some pictures to recreate the events around the time of the murder, showing the waitress who found the victim. This leads him and Sergeant Sellers to re-question Baffin and get the information that basically solves the murder, and exposes the wider scandal of campaign contributions to legislators. This fast-moving story is like the best of the Cases of Perry Mason, and an implicit critique of society. It uses the building of an apartment house as a clock to date a photograph.

Uelmen is a professor and former dean of the School of Law at Santa Clara University. He was part of O. J. Simpson's defense team from the beginning, and can speak with authority about this trial. The sixteen chapters contain the lessons that readers may learn. There is no index. You should be familiar with this case or have read some other books before reading this overview of a Trial of the Century. After the jury verdict there was an abundance of proposed solutions which were thoughtless and wrong (p.1). A knowledge of history would correct these errors for those \\"unhappy with the verdict\\" (p.3). These proposals have led California to intellectual, fiscal, and moral bankruptcy in the criminal system, which is weighted heavily in favor of the prosecution (p.4). Many innocents have been convicted because of mistaken identification, police perjury, or simple incompetence by a defense lawyer (p.5). The foolish call for reforms have occurred in the past (p.7). The first lesson from this trial was how the Corporate Media fooled the people and fueled this controversy (p.8). [Joe Bosco said the trial he witnessed was different from the trial broadcast by the media.] <br /> <br />The media blitz led by DA Garcetti affected public opinion. But this allowed the defense to bypass the grand jury and go to a preliminary hearings (p.23). The double-dealing of the prosecution's grand jury is described on page 25. Fuhrman and Vannatter \\"contradicted each other on many key points\\" (p.35). Page 39 tells of the effect of the exclusionary rule, and why judges won't do anything. Do judges lack \\"moral courage\\" (p.45)? The \\"narcissistic personality disorder\\" (p.47) is defined as \\"a grandiose sense of self-importance, a need for excessive admiration, and fantasies of unlimited power and brilliance\\". [Does this remind you of some of your managers?] Uelmen shows his wisdom on page 65, unlike the critics. The need for press interviews by defense lawyers is explained (pp.69-70). <br /> <br />Their concern about evidence tampering and forging is explained (p.72). California law allows a lawyer to protect his client from prejudicial publicity (p.75). The foolish actions of \\"knee-jerk\\" politicians is described on page 77. The \\"National Enquirer\\" is more honest than \\"TIME\\" (p.78). A juror's race is part of their life experience, which affects judgments (p.81). Uelmen explains the death penalty (pp.82-83), and why selecting jurors is very important (pp.88-89). Video recording of trials could be a good teaching tool, but television allows reporters to comment as if they knew what happened (p.94)! The bias of commentators is explained on page 95. They had no idea! Television helped to find witnesses (p.99). But TV is for entertainment, not justice (p.101). <br /> <br />The murders of Nicole and Ron had nothing to do with domestic violence, based on the evidence; it was smear tactics (p.103)! The problems with the blood evidence and its collections are on page 122. The prosecution delayed the defense's testing of the samples (pp.123-4). The flip-flop testimony about OJ's blood sample is on page 126. The Fuhrman tapes were \\"the most devastating evidence\\" to completely destroy the credibility of this police officer (p.129). Fuhrman had been extolled as a model officer. When the Prosecutors learned of these tapes, they tried to get a mistrial (p.145)! I think the original intent of the Fifth Amendment was to prevent torture by forcing a person to testify against himself (p.155). \\"Third degree\\" methods were still used in the early 20th century. The Prosecutors would do anything to convict (p.165). A defendant can be convicted on the basis of circumstantial evidence only if no other conclusion is possible (p.167). Were the threats to Cochran meant to force him to accept guards (p.171)? The jury quickly said \\"not guilty\\", there was \\"something wrong\\" with the prosecution's case (p.180). Watching a trial on TV gives the illusion of actually being there (p.182). Uelmen explains the difference between a criminal trial and a civil trial (p.195). [The example of Lizzie Borden shows flawed research (p.196).] A trial isn't a search for truth, but to have a vision of truth prevail 9p.199). Civil liberties in America are documented in the criminal courtrooms, where the Government infringes on the individual's rights for the weak and powerless (p.205). Chapter 16 summarizes the lessons from this trial. <br />	2005-03-04

Lam will live as a wealthy young man; a plush job? But he has to keep expenses down. But Lam knows how to fiddle an expense account (Chapter 2)! This mousetrap soon snaps on a buyer; the offered price is just over the businessman's offered price. But it seems too easy to Lam. Could this be a frame-up? This investigation continues to get more answers. <br /> <br />Lam tries to identify the young woman who sent him a telegram. While lunching at a cafeteria, Lam follows a woman who returns to the office of Carson's competitor, Herbert Dowling. [The reason for this isn't clear to me.] Dowling leaves for a rendezvous at a motel. A tragic event creates new problems for Lam and Dowling's woman visitor. [About now I began to guess how this story would end.] The police search for Lam, and Lam seeks a witness to clear him of the frame-up. The hearing leads to a solution when a prosecution witness changes her testimony. <br /> <br />\\"A. A. Fair\\" wrote detective stories that had a grittier style from the Cases of Perry Mason. Its as if Erle Stanley Gardner wanted to return to his earlier stories, like \\"Ken Corning\\". This book also has a message about certain police practices of that era. It reminds the reader that eyewitness testimony must be corroborated by facts, since there's no way to know if an eyewitness is mistaken or lying.

Archer, a business executive, visits the agency to hire 24-hour bodyguards for his confidential secretary Marilyn Chelan. She has been getting threatening telephone calls and letters from an anonymous person. Chapter 2 tells how Donald Lam needles the caller to provoke him into talking. Chapter 3 tells how Lam now follows Archer from Marilyn's apartment. Archer made phone calls from a public booth. The next day Lam and Bertha Cool compare notes; something is going on in this case. Marilyn decides she doesn't want protection, and this job is over for Cool & Lam (Chapter 4). Lam creates a cover story for his activity on Rhoda Avenue (Chapter 5). Sergeant Frank Sellers tells Lam to forget everything he may have seen around Rhoda Avenue (Chapter 7). There was a murder there of a woman who ran an escort service, furnishing attractive girls for dates. Lam explains the circumstances to his secretary Elsie Brand (Chapter 8). <br /> <br />Complications arise, and Donald Lam again talks to Marilyn Chelan. Is there a connection to Rhoda Avenue (Chapter 10)? Chapter 11 reveals the hidden facts of this case, but Marilyn's connection is unknown. Chapter 12 tells how to fix an identification for a line-up. In Chapter 14 we find out about the hidden scandal. There is a connection to the events in Chapter 1. Eventually an interrogation brings out the hidden facts (which ties in the characters introduced earlier). Cremating a body prevents any test for toxic chemicals (Chapter 18). But the case is cracked when somebody talks (Chapter 19). Arranging sexual liaison for blackmail purposes is an old, old trick for secret services, and others. But the bait doesn't always catch the fish. A perfect plan failed when applied to an imperfect world. Corporate corruption is covered up. One anachronism was the \\"woman's woolen stocking\\" used as a murder weapon. [This story echoes some of the events in the \\"Black Dahlia Avenger\\" book.] Nixon's 1971 devaluation of the dollar soon made these dollar figures. <br />	2005-03-01

This book tells how Wall Street firms swindled billions during the 1990s. President Clinton's tax increase produced low interest rates that fueled the stock market expansion. But this bubble of New Economy stocks would inevitable burst (p.5). What would falling prices for broadband do to the billions of dollars in bonds (p.7)? The ending of corporate pension plans forced employees into the stock market, where individuals faced unforeseen and unknown risks (p.8). This demand caused prices to rise without any increase in underlying values. The culprits, says the author, was the analysts who pumped out research that justified overvalued stocks (p.8). But this is a cop-out; analysts are employees who do as their told. They're only a pawn in this game (p.10). Were investors \\"greedy\\"? That's blaming the victim, and admitting to fraud (misrepresenting the value of the item sold). But crooks can stay out of prison by paying off the politicians and the government they control. NY Attorney General Eliot Spitzer exposed this corrupt process. You should read this book if you plan to invest in the stock market, have an IRA or 401K, or wonder about the plan to invest Social Security monies into the next offerings of Wall Street. The average small investor isn't smart or nimble enough to benefit from advertised offerings. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 warns against listening to stock broker's \\"research\\": its just advertising designed to get you to buy a product (p.19). Chapter 2 tells how Internet stocks were measured in \\"hits\\" and \\"clicks\\", not earnings and share prices (p.30). The 'New Economy' is described in Chapter 3; they sold shares in companies that had no profits in the past year (p.55). Chapter 4 tells how companies like WorldCom paid for favorable reports (p.74). The 1996 Telecommunications Act forced telephone companies to open up tonew competitors (p.85). Chapter 5 explains how average people were enticed to buy stocks with their savings (pp.96-97). Brokers peddled stock to small investors to gain sucker money (p.99). Could a dot-com company's headquarters be a post office box (p.105)? Does \\"get rich quick\\" investing work (p.112)? Chapter 6 explains what happened when stocks could no longer be pumped up - the price slumped to its real value. <br /> <br />Chapter 7 tells how analysts' true function was to sell deals to investors (p.131). The slow crash of tech stocks was one of the biggest destructions of wealth in the nation's history (p.187). The SEC was snoozing while people were losing (p.190). Upper class brokers stole more than organized crime (p.193)! The 9/11 tragedy distracted America from the various scandals and losses (p.230). Did Spitzer persecute Merrill (p.260)? Was the SEC asleep on the job? The end of the Glass-Steagall Act created massive financial companies that served the rich and powerful (p.266). Page 273 explained how brokerage firms are targeted. A deal was cut for reform (p.283). (Who represented the consumers?) Chapter 13 starts with the 'smoking gun' E-mails of Cutler and Grubman. It involved top executives (p.288). Using the telephone prevents any messages from being preserved (p.298). Will analysts be protected from investment bankers in the future (p.303)? Page 304 suggests an answer. <br />	2005-02-18

Radin covered hundreds of murder trials as a news reporter, and received awards for distinguished fact-crime reporting. In the 1950s he was given the \\"signed confession\\" of Lizzie Borden and used scientific investigation as to its authenticity (Chapter XI). Radin hired a Questioned Document Examiner, who explained why it was a forgery. Radin explained the falsity behind two legends of Lizzie. He pointed out that Edmund Pearson's \\"Trial of Lizzie Borden\\" was so one-sided as to be a hoax. Radin corrected that story, but also bent his story by pointing suspicion at Bridget. Lizzie said \\"it wasn't Bridget ...\\", and the same lack of evidence against Lizzie also applied to Bridget! <br /> <br />Charles Henry Putnam said Lizzie was \\"a nice girl, fond of outdoor activities, fun to be with, a very pleasant companion\\". Those who didn't know Lizzie had a different opinion. Most knowledge of the crime came from Edmund Pearson's book, not the original sources. Radin studied the trial testimony, the preliminary court hearing, portions of the inquest, and newspapers from that time. Lizzie Borden was innocent. The assumptions of guilt was due to caste and class prejudice against the wealthy mill owners. A newspaper war resulted when the upstart 'Fall River Globe' blamed Lizzie, and the establishment newspaper defended her. An unstated cause was the human emotion where people like to look down on someone else. Radin's book shows his skill as a newspaper journalist in describing events (Chapter II). But he does omit or censor facts, such as the name of the heir who had been forced to go along with Andrew Borden's low offer. Fall River pioneered in the manufacture of cotton cloth. <br /> <br />Radin assumes a \\"lack of display of normal tenderness\\" based on the question to Lizzie whether Mr. and Mrs. Borden were \\"happily united\\". This was a trick question that could trap Lizzie into admitting too much knowledge for a Puritan maiden. The bedroom placement may answer that question. One fact unmentioned by most writers was that the 1890s saw the worst depression until the Great Depression of 1929-1949. A publicized murder trial kept people's minds off their own problems. Remember the Lindbergh kidnapping? James J. Kirby tells of his favorable impression of Lizzie before the murders. Lizzie's charity work distinguished her from the rest of the family; would she keep her father's secret no matter what? She was \\"a very kind person throughout her life\\". <br /> <br />Much has been made of Alice Russell's story that Wednesday night, but was it ever corroborated? Could it have been created to force Lizzie to testify at the trial? Hiram C. Harrington's story has too many details to have resulted from a few minutes of discussion; I think it was created as a provocation (Chapter VI). Arguments over Lizzie created many brawls (Chapter VII). Lizzie was supported by feminists and the WCTU. Chapter VIII summarizes the trial, \\"one of the most mysterious of the celebrated cases of the century\\". When Lizzie described the contents of the basket it could have been from prior knowledge. Chapter IX explains the case against Edmund Pearson and his biased writings. This is an important analysis. Chapter X tries to solve the case from the known suspects. Radin suggests Bridget's testimony was a detriment to Lizzie, so Bridget could not have been rewarded with a \\"big bundle\\" of cash. [Unless it was all part of the show, as per Arnold R. Brown.] Radin uses differences in testimony to cast suspicion on Bridget, but people remember differently. Radin is wrong in claiming that it takes longer to wash inside windows than outside windows (practical experience). The fact that Lizzie, Emma, and Uncle John slept in the house suggests they knew they would be safe there; Bridget didn't know and stayed away. The big fault in Radin's solution is its claim that he was a better judge of the facts than the dozens of people who were there at the scene. No, and his failure to mention Bertha Manchester says so. David Kent's \\"Forty Whacks\\" is easier to find and more modern than this book. <br />	2005-02-18

This was written in 1971, just after the pioneering days of programming had ended, when colleges began to issue degrees in computer programming. Its like a fossil of an extinct species. The ability to do programming well is a talent that not all have (p.3). Like other talents, it can be well-paid. But these costs are targeted by computer management. Weinberg believes programmers can learn by reading programs. How many managers would allow this? <br /> <br />The story on page 18 shows that simple logic is not only easier to code, but avoids the bugs that come from complexity. [I suspect the original programmers started with little planning or design.] Page 34 points out that OS/360 JCL isn't hard to use, its hard to learn. Using keywords may be easier, but its more verbose than positional parameters (another trade-off). The paragraph on 'egoless programming' may not be usable in areas with changing personnel, a management that plays favorites or encourages dissent (divide et impera). The point of \\"clear and understandable\\" (p.59) implicitly criticizes subtle and sneaky code, but doesn't address job security. [There is no mention of on-line debuggers that will execute a program statement by statement. <br /> <br />Having a referee to look over programming is more important during initial construction than later maintenance. The discussion of \\"raw trainees\\" overlooks other areas, like the military or a factory assembly line. There is a certain amount of time needed for training, depending on the complexity of the task. Nothing can change that (p.69). Since programming is done by humans, it will always have 'human error' (p.72). Page 74 proves the need for program review by a referee, and for a ban against modifying executable code (non-reentrant). Technical arguments are often a mask for political power, and its rewards (p.78). The story on page 88 doesn't tell who pulledthe plug! Chapter 5 concludes with the problems in 'herding cats' (p.91). The story about a dissatisfied programmer doesn't consider the idea that the manager may have felt threatened and acted accordingly (pp.97-98).  <br /> <br />Doesn't Weinberg realize that his democratic team sounds like socialism? Has anyone anywhere tested the \\"simple maxim\\" on page 100? Page 104 explains the hidden agenda of polling: say something enough times and people will believe it. Weinberg should know that the adversarial relationship between testers and programmers is needed to prevent any problems from being overlooked (p.108). The \\"success of the Austrian Army\\" (p.108)? The story on page 110 doesn't ring true; aren't project managers downgraded if they're \\"too technical\\" (loss of objectivity)? Page 137 reminds me of those days when a bug could be due to hardware error.  <br /> <br />The story on page 157 overlooks the fact that a big expensive project could be canceled if the obvious question was raised. The comment on labels is very  true, but doesn't mention typing errors as another source of bugs (p.163). Weinberg's comment that re-writing a program is far easier than the first writing (p.165) explains the 'success' of the Structured Programming Fad in the late 1970s: \\"write a program in one day instead of a week\\". Wasn't the article on palindromic programming a hoax (p.174)?  The pages on Linearity (pp.231-232) are very informative, but don't mention the effect of punched cards on the use of GO TO statements (adding new coding to the back of the deck). The problem of format errors can be handled by a one-page memo for each programmer (p.236). Are Weinberg's comments on COBOL (p.240) valid afterwards for COBOL II? The bug (typing error) on page 249 could be caught by a code reviewer. The story about \\"hasty punching\\" (p.260) does not mention the need for teaching programmers how to type for efficiency and productivity. CRT terminals give instant feedback. Batch allows code reviews, on-line gets faster results (p.261). <br /> <br />The topic of 'Documentation' doesn't distinguish between that written for the user of a program, and that written for program maintenance. A well-documented program should have comments where needed; the programmer is usually NOT the one to decide where it is needed (code review). Another method is to have the original programmer responsible for all future maintenance. Note how \\"documentation\\" is not defined here (p.262). As I remember it, the author left his University job after this book was published. What did that suggest? <br />	2005-02-14
352723:US	38002140	R4UWK9X4EBJVF	0060589957	918070082	Black Dahlia Avenger: A Genius for Murder	Books	4	8	12	N	N	Investigating a Horrible Crime	From 1963 to 1986 Steve Hodel was a police officer and then detective-supervisor in the LAPD. Most murders are solved by police work: walking the streets, locating and interviewing friends, associates, and witnesses. Information gathered will point to a suspect with a motive (p.5). The facts will provide clues to the solution. A criminal can wear gloves to avoid fingerprints, but cannot hide motives. After this 'Introduction' the author recreates the times and the crimes. <br /> <br />On January 15, 1947 the police were notified of a dead body. Reporters were first on the scene and photographed their scoop. Things are different today (p.12). The body was placed near a sidewalk, not hidden away. Death was from multiple blows to the head and bleeding out. The six newspapers in Los Angeles competed in publicizing this case. The 'Black Dahlia' case was bigger than the Lindbergh kidnapping (p.20). Chapter 3 gives the personal life of the author, who had a cold and distant father (married four times). The author had the knack to read a person's character (p.24). His remote father had a mysterious life; he had no personal friends when he died at 94 (p.34). After his father's death Hodel began the investigation that starts in Chapter 5. His genius father led a complex and unconventional life. Dr. George Hodel specialized in the treatment of venereal disease (p.77). George was a friend of Man Ray, both were interested in Sadism (p.87). Chapter 7, \\"The Hollywood Scandal\\" suggests times haven't changed in the Film Capital. Or was Tamar a \\"pathological liar\\" (p.95)? Dr. Hodel was acquitted of incest in court but his career had ended (p.99). Chapter 8 tells of Steve's horrible childhood. Was writing this book a good therapy? Was \\"market research\\" just a cover name for intelligence operations (p.113)? <br /> <br />Chapter 11 gives the statements of the witnesses who knew Elizabeth Short in the weeks before her death. There were other murders of lone women during the same period (p.152). The newspapers created the hoax of \\"the real Dahlia killer\\" in an attempt to solve the crime (pp.186-7). But the real killer struck again (Chapter 14). The transfer of Captain Donahue was \\"part of an organizational conspiracy within the LAPD to protect\\" a person (p.199). This was \\"one of the biggest corruption scandals in the history of the LAPD\\"! Page 271 tells of J. Edgar Hoover's attempt to access Social Security files. The handwriting analysis in Chapter 22 provides physical evidence comparing the known printing to the unknown samples. Wouldn't the original detectives have access to the printing? (Should other samples have been included?) The murders of other lone women at that time are in Chapter 23. <br /> <br />Chapter 25 tells of crusading Sergeant Charles Stoker and his investigation into an abortion ring protected by the LAPD Gangster Squad. Chapter 26 explains the corruption in 1930s Los Angeles. Millionaire businessmen controlled the California Club and the LA Chamber of Commerce. Page 371 explains the theory of a cover-up. Could the LAPD obstruct justice and allow a psychopathic killer to remain free (Chapter 28)? Did murder of young women in LA really suddenly stop after Dr. George Hodel left California (p.399)? Chapter 33 provides the argument for guilt. I don't think it could convict, and maybe not even indict: \\"a lack of evidence\\" (p.450).

Ingelram returned to Europe with the South American passport and arrived in Berlin to pose as a Nazi sympathizer. Ingelram's attempt to stay in Sweden failed. After he returned to Germany he was arrested, as the Gestapo had learned of his false passport. Luck let him escape from prison, then make his way into occupied Poland to escape to the middle East. There are style differences from his earlier work. This story has more adventures and events, but seems more fictional that way, or, designed for a film script (the cast of contrasting characters). But by this time the market for WW II adventure dramas was gone.<br /><br />This book also describes life in the wild for a lone hunter, living without human comforts. Those who have spent weeks in a jungle can best comment on these pages. In the end \\"Bill Smith\\" finds the death that he seemed to be seeking in these stories. The moral of this story is the need for the proper tool when ridding a farm of a predatory big cat. The oath of never firing a shot seems to have been invented to write finish to this story. [Unstated is the unhappy childhood of a Englishman whose mother was Austrian, an enemy alien.] There is one fault in this story, where Casimir says the two Slovaks didn't speak a word of Polish.

It is written in the form of a journal or confession by an Englishman gentleman sportsman who hunted the most dangerous game. The writer was caught, tortured, then thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident. But he survived and escaped from a central European country. However, the agents of this country were put on his trail in England. <br /> <br />The unnamed hero withdraws funds from his account, then disappears into the country to hide in solitude. But in his escape an enemy agent dies, and the English police are on his trail too. The foreign agents can now use police reports to locate this fugitive. The story tells how he escapes, how he hides, and what happens after his is tracked down by a secret agent. The good guy escapes, assumes the identity of this secret agent, and lays a false trail out of the country. <br /> <br />This story records the thoughts of the hero. Dialogue is sparse. Parts of this story explain the operations of a secret agent. The author served as an Intelligence Officer in Rumania and the Middle East during WW II. His \\"Rogue Justice\\" is the sequel to this book. If you can accept the premise that his captors wouldn't finish him off in the beginning, the rest of the story follow.

There is a remarkable resemblance between these two, and they tell each other their life stories. Both were exiled after killing a man over a woman. But the German Baron plans to kill Dominey and return to England in his stead. This will allow undercover work during the coming war to crush England! The Baron travels to meet Seaman in South Africa and find the wealth needed to carry out the impersonation. <br /> <br />People notice some differences in the returned Sir Edward, who cleans up the mess he left behind. His wife gets proper care and begins to recover from her long illness. \\"Dominey\\" runs into the Baroness whose husband he killed in that duel; she is not fooled and now wants to marry. \\"Dominey\\" can do nothing as this could reveal his secret and overturn his life as an English country squire. A visitor brings a warning from Africa, then disappears from his room! There is the conflict between those who warn against a war with Germany and those who seek peace. But the conflict between Austria and Servia begins; countries mobilize for war, ending the hopes for peace. At the end the impersonation is unmasked. The backgrounds provide a description of life for the English gentry and their villagers that will disappear in a generation (it reminds me of Agatha Christie's stories). <br />	2005-02-10

The power of big business is at its peak, the state of national welfare is in the dumps, due to jobs exported overseas. The welfare of people has been sacrificed to benefit Corporate Businesses. After Lou Dobbs started to cover the outsourcing of jobs on his CNN show, he received insults, slurs, and personal attacks. His critics could not refute his facts and reasons (p.3). Lou Dobbs is a “free enterprise ... Republican” (p.5). If Big Corporations prosper at the expense of the middle class and wage earners, then any plea to Corporate America is a joke. This is why corporate greed ships American jobs overseas. What can we do to make America great again?   Chapter 1 tells of the assault on middle class Americans by Corporations. Domestic automakers are cutting back, foreign automakers are investing. If most production is offshore, who will buy these products (p.19)? Chapter 2 asks if there is any limit on Corporate greed (p.22). Does criticizing “out sourcing” make Lou Dobbs an “enemy of the state” (p.26)? Dobbs exposes the fantasy that paying people less “will result in a higher standard of living for all of us” (p.32)! Outsourcing reduces tax revenues for local, state, and federal governments. Chapter 3 reminds us that corporate management has defrauded investors and fired employees (p.42). The “Free Trade” agreements resulted in $500 Billion trade deficits. Chapter 4 asserts that multinational companies are far too influential in American politics (p.53). They control the “knowledge base” used by Congress to make laws (p.53). “Free Trade” is a slogan used to promote the interests of multinational companies. Is investment in China a long term good? Page 61 explains how the transfer of assets is used to hide profits; page 62 explains how to avoid paying a fair share of taxes.   Chapter 5 notes the high costs that result when American companies build foreign factories to produce products for the American market (p.71). Dobbs complains about the failure to improve fuel efficiency (p.72), but doesn’t mention how this benefits Big Oil. Most jobs lost through NAFTA were in manufacturing; most clothing is now imported. Asia owns half of US Treasury bonds (p.79). Chapter 6 tells of the effects from exporting jobs (p.82). Ross Perot warned us (p.90). Patient diagnoses, radiology, legal research, financial analysis, and call centers have all been outsourced. Will this kill off professions (p.97)? Chapter 7 asks if there is any proof that outsourcing is good for the country (p.102). Dobbs lists twelve myths of outsourcing. Adam Smith favored free trade where there was a mutuality of benefits (p.106). Protectionist policies create trade surpluses (p.109). When jobs disappear, they are not replaced (pp.110 4). [No mention of the benefits to merchant bankers who finance this trade.]     Chapter 8 condemns state governments that outsource government services (p.120). Corporations have shifted taxes to ordinary citizens, but these earn relatively less (p.136). Chapter 9 says America is the largest debtor nation in the history of the world (p.138). America has lost the ability to produce the goods it needs (pp.140 1). Almost every benefit that workers enjoy in this country is directly attributable to the efforts of labor unions. Their decline since 1981 was followed by a decline in living standards for ordinary Americans (pp.144 5). President Bush has not enforced the trade laws (p.146). Chapter 10 says our free trade policies do not serve our national economic, social, and political interests. Nothing can be done as long as political parties are owned and controlled by Big Corporations (p.152). Dobbs cure is: ban outsourcing, adopt balanced trade agreements, change our relations with the WTO to raise the standard of living. Unless there is “an honest public debate” the destructive economy will continue.	2005-02-09

It operates in absolute secrecy, only revealing its judgments in formal written opinions. Their decision making has been kept secret from the people who are affected. This book tells about the inner workings of the Burger Court from 1969 to 1976. The Supreme Court can reinterpret laws, the Constitution, and prior cases. Numerous confidential sources provided information. It tells how 'LIFE' magazine was used to discredit Abe Fortas  to force his resignation (pp.18-19). Page 21 gives the political reasons for Burger's selection. Page 24 suggests the fix was in: the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously recommended Burger. The next seven chapters cover the years 1969 to 1975; each Supreme Court term coves one year from October to June or early July. <br /> <br />Do you know that newspapers manipulate the news (p.31)? [You can see this if your area has more than one newspaper.] One of Burger's first actions was against the rigorous code of ethics proposed for federal judges by Earl Warren (p.32). Next he restricted the normal intercommunication between the law clerks (pp.34-35). Was Burger \\"petty, unpleasant, and dishonest\\" (p.71)? Page 85 tells how Burger tried to change the rules to benefit a monopoly. This was a violation of judicial restraint and strict constructionism! Burger then backed down from Douglas' proposed dissent. While the emphasis is on Warren Earl Burger, the personalities and characters of the other Judges are displayed. Many cases were undecided because the Court was deadlocked 4 to 4. Blackmun would provide the deciding vote on these and future cases. This ended Burger's first term as Chief Justice. This book seems slow-paced in covering many details about the Justices. After 25 years, this then important story has faded into the background of history. But its important to understand that the Justices are politicians who do not need popular approval. This book does notgo into much detail as to why a specific judge was picked. <br /> <br />The \\"Constitutional Journal\\" by Jeffrey St. John was written as a journalistic summary of the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Article III Section 1 defined the Court system. They left further changes to Congress. There is nothing in Section 1 that mandates life-tenure, except by default. Congress could specify a term for a fixed number of years, or an age limit. There are examples from history for an age limit. There were six Justices in Washington's era, seven for Jefferson, and nine for Jackson. About one Justice for every two states. If this example was followed we could have had twenty-one Justices by FDR's era. This could allow more work to be done more quickly. <br />	2005-02-04

Zeiger is a writer and playwright who analyzed the career of Ian Fleming, and wrote this 1965 biography. Zeiger tells how many of Fleming's experiences in Naval Intelligence during the War were used in his fictional exploits about \\"James Bond\\". This book lacks an index. Chapter 1 tells about Fleming's early life. His father came from a wealthy banking/stock broker background, and died in World War I. This explains Bond as a conspicuous consumer of the finer things of life, and as a Conservative. Chapter 2 says Fleming was educated at Eton, and became \\"an athlete of exceptional power\\" (p.27). Fleming then went to Sandhurst, but refused a commission in the cavalry. He chose the Foreign Service and studied languages at Geneva and Munich, but failed to get an opening. He then got a job at Reuters, and succeeded by \\"his attention to detail and his willingness to take on little assignments\\" (p.34). Fleming's first story was to cover the trial of British engineers arrested in Moscow in 1933 as spies. \\"Sabotage\\" could be the usual problems found at the low end of the learning curve (p.45). The OGPU method for extracting confessions is on page 52. After his success, Fleming left for a job as a merchant banker and more money.    Chapter 3 tells of Fleming's talents for intelligence: good languages and business knowledge. Fleming oversaw various activities and reported to the Director of Naval Intelligence (p.65). The early days of the war saw mistakes, but these were replaced by successes (pp.70-72). Pages 76-78 tell of Fleming's intelligence unit \\"30AU\\". His wartime background was used to write his adventure novels. After the war Fleming returned to journalism. Chapter 4 discusses Fleming's life after the war, and his career as a novelist. Fleming admired the American writers of the modern thriller, and the importance of pace (keeping the reader's interest). Concrete details were used to add verisimilitude to the fantasy plot, set in interesting and exciting place.Fleming's favorite car was the two-seat 1955 Thunderbird (p.103). Sales of Fleming's novels soared after JFK's recommendation (p.114).    Chapter 5 presents Zeiger's analysis of Fleming's stories. Like some Eric Ambler stories, they show an individual struggling against superior forces, and winning via personal fortitude. (As if life were  that simple!) Does this popularity tell something about our society? Popular literature has always dealt with violence (the Iliad, Beowulf, the Song of Roland). Other novels deal with sex more than Fleming does. Was James Bond a hero in an age of anti-heroes (p.125)? Zeiger critiques \\"Casino Royale\\" for its death of Le Chiffre before the end of the story (pp.126-137). Was Fleming toying with conventional plots? Wasn't his style different from Raymond Chandler's (p.128)? Why does Bond travel by train rather than plane (p.129)? But that's what Fleming did in the 1940s, and Bond would do in 1950s Europe. Drax's cheating at cards is a sign that he is not an English Gentleman (p.131). Zeiger comments on other Fleming stories. [I found \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" not equal to the earlier stories. Could it have been ghost-written?] Zeiger describes the villain as basically a none upper-class Englishman, who lacks good manners and correct tastes (pp.142-143); none are from inherited wealth (p.145). Does this reflect the fears of a declining upper-class world (p.146)? This is the background of Ian Fleming (p.148). Does James Bond represent a fantasy life that Ian Fleming wanted (p.149)? Zeiger's analysis will shine a new light on these old stories. Read Dusko Popov's autobiography for the facts behind the fiction.	2005-02-03

Your results may vary. The 'Introduction' asks about the interest in the Civil War. Aside from a trend of fashion, it marked a turning point in America. Before, most Americans lived not too differently from past centuries. After, the railroads, canals, and electricity created modern life (as in other countries during the Victorian Age). It is also politically safe, unlike the Revolutionary Wars. The concerns of that time are still with us, although the question of secession was settled. Perhaps the major change was the creation of large corporations, and the lessening power of the middle class. Davis doesn't grasp that Official History, as a collection of battles and dates, is a way to avoid the still important political events of that era. Income tax, greenback dollars, Federal control to aid corporations, corporate control of politics, are all controversial topics. No one can create controversy by sticking to the simple facts, however dull and dreary they are (p. xvi). The fashionable theory about the cause of the Civil War (p.xxx) is another way to avoid reality and mislead students. <br /> <br />This collection of anecdotes will educate and entertain the reader, and is the purpose for this book. Mike Wright's \\"What They Didn't Teach You ...\\" books cover events left out of the academic histories. The original intent of history is for popular entertainment: the Iliad, the Odyssey, Beowulf, the Song of Roland. Or the dramatizations on TV and film (\\"rewriting history\\" was George Orwell's description. <br /> <br />Every book reflects the author's outlook and bias. Page 78 fails to note that the state of Zacatecas also revolted against Santa Anna's dictatorship, and were crushed. Davis oversimplified the Mexican War (p.79). Other military dictatorships have proved incompetent against foreign troops (Greece, Argentina). The discussion about earlier political parties fails to mention the Anti-Masonic party (p.115). Page 119 does not explain \\"Beecher's Bibles\\". Davis should read the book on the US Camel Corps (p.153). A few hundred \\"wealthy and upper-middle-class men\\" still decide the destiny of millions (p.154). The paragraph on blockade running didn't mention the British Bahamas (p.171). The page on Southern cotton didn't mention the greater importance of Northern wheat (p.199). <br /> <br />Davis correctly complains that American history ignores events elsewhere (p.196). In describing the battle of the ironclads (p.216), he does not mention whether Great Britain or France had built one earlier. Do you think politicians have to compromise? Page 251 explains why. Those who wanted a negotiated settlement with the Confederacy wore a copper penny that then had a Liberty head on it (p.296). After wards Congress ordered the use of Lincoln's profile on the penny. The St. Albans bank robbery does not mention this area as a supply center for horses (p.380). Davis says the military commission that investigated the conspiracy \\"should have been a civilian\\" (p.415), but ignores the fact that Washington was under martial law. I once read that \\"kuklux\\" imitated the sound of a musket hammer being cocked (p.432). Davis doesn't know much about George Armstrong Custer \\"eccentric cavalry commander\\" (p.438). Davis fails to mention Lew Wallace's term as Governor of New Mexico Territory (p.448). The notes about John Singleton Mosby was informative (p.444). Appendix II lists the many Presidents who had no Vice-President. <br />	2005-02-02

Their law allowed the police to arrest anyone off the street and send them to a work camp without a trial. Some of these died from being shot while in custody. Clyde Snow's father was an M.D. who practiced in the Texas panhandle, east of Lubbock and beside the railroad. Chapter 1 tells of Snow's life and career. Hunters, and gatherers of wild crops, are famed for discovering lost bodies (p.33). Chapter 2 tells of the trial of Dr. John Webster for the murder of Dr. George Parkman. It gives the history of forensic identification by Bertillon and Vucetich. Chapter 3 tells of the trial of Adolphe Luetgert, who killed his wife and boiled her body in lye to destroy the evidence. The influence of Bertillon advanced forensic anthropology in Europe (p.77). Diet and modern medicine have changed bones (p.83). Anthropologists helped to identify the remains of dead soldiers, and recalculated height from the femur (p.84)     Page 101 tells of the \\"human error\\" involved in body identification after an airplane crash (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 tells how the identity of murder victims can be established by recreating a face from a skull, but its not perfect. It won't work if the family will not identify the victim. Chapter 6 tells how the identity was found for a modern mummy. Chapter 7 tells of identifying the bones found at the site of \\"Custer's Last Stand\\". Was George Armstrong Custer really buried in General Custer's tomb (p.146)? Chapter 8 tells how Snow identified the skeleton of Josef Mengele. Was there conflict amount the government agencies (p.162)? Chapter 9 has the final solution to the identity of Josef Mengele with \\"reasonable scientific certainty\\" (p.200). Chapter 10 tells how they found Mengele's dental records (p.208). They could not do DNA testing (p.211).    Chapter 11 tells of the Argentina politics that killed thousands of its people. Under Peron the life of the people improved, until he was overthrown (p.219). WhenPeron returned, conflict continued and thousands were made to disappear (p.220). This terror was described on pages 222 to 228. One effect was to loot the country by skyrocketing foreign debt (p.227). Clyde Snow and his colleagues came to Argentina to identify the unnamed remains. [There is no mention of what the Ford and Carter administrations were doing.] Snow gathered a group of students to learn his techniques for identifying people from their bones. Chapter 12 tells of the identification of one of the victims, Liliana Pereyra. She had given birth before she was murdered, and the child also disappeared.    Chapter 13 explains how Snow used the statistics of anonymous burials to prove the murder of thousands (p.27). Most anonymous burials are of old men, not people in their twenties. Another statistic was the high number of those dying from gunshot wounds (p.273). Snow's Argentine team was invited to the Philippines by President Aquino (p.277). A new Argentina law excused \\"torture, murder, arbitrary arrest, and misrepresentations\\" if the perpetrator was just following orders (p.279)! Chapter 14 ends the book telling about the ongoing investigation into the identification of unnamed bones. Appendix 1 names the parts of the human skull. Appendix 2 names the parts of the human skeleton. [Are these military putschs possible in a nation that has a right to keep and bear arms?]	2005-02-01

Erickson helped to win the war by reporting about Germany's synthetic oil production, which also produced munitions and rubber. Strategic bombing reduced oil production, and the munitions as well. The lack of oil and gasoline reduced the mobility of the troops and tanks sent against the Normandy Invasion, and on the Eastern Front. To avoid Allied bombings, some factories were sent to eastern Germany; these were soon overrun by Soviet forces. The lack of gasoline meant less training for fighter pilots, which created severe losses against better trained Allied pilots. It also meant less break-in time for aircraft engines, and more failures in flight. The lack of munitions resulted in fewer and less effective AA shells. In the last months of the war Germany had difficulties in moving troops, tanks, and supplies. Germany began the war with the mechanized Blitzkrieg, and ended with horse-drawn transportation. Chapter 43 and Appendix B of the book explain how strategic bombing helped win the war. The First World War was also about oil, and so will the next World War.  <br /> <br />Eric Erickson had many years' experience in the oil business when he was recruited into intelligence work in Dec 1939. He cultivated a pro-Nazi outlook, then traveled to Germany to buy oil and pay with Swedish iron ore. He noticed wartime food shortages in Sept 1941, and the newspapers reported the execution of traitors (8) and spies (5) as if this was a common occurrence. Consider this question: Goering takes Hitler, Himmler, and Goebbels for an airplane ride; if the plane crashes, who is saved? The answer is: the German people. Telling this joke would get you shot! (Have you heard the more recent version?) <br /> <br />Erickson noticed the effect of terror bombing the civilian population: it strengthened morale and the people's will to resist! It was more than immoral, it wasn't cost-effective. He traveled to the many synthetic oil plants, taking note of defenses, and production capability. He never wrote anything down, just passed the information orally to his many contacts. He was debriefed upon his return to Sweden by Allied military intelligence. <br /> <br />Erickson was able to travel freely because of his scheme to build a synthetic oil plant in neutral Sweden. It could not be bombed, and could ship oil to Germany. The Nazi rulers also appreciated the importance of investing their loot in a neutral country. JC Masterman also noted that personal honesty of the British helped defeat German greed in the area of espionage. <br /> <br />	2005-01-29

You can't please all of the people all of the time. But this requires an egalitarian society, not one where 2% of the people own 80% of the wealth. Money represents the power of the super-rich, and trumps the votes of the ordinary people. This is why campaign contributions are in a bad odor; it represents the power of the few over the needs and wants of the many. This book from a Washington lobbyist tells about events that seldom make the newspapers. Editors and publishers have their agendas and priorities too. So be educated and entertained by Winter-Berger's stories. <br /> <br />You can ask if anything is different today, but you can guess what the answer is. Do you ever wonder if things were different in the days of Washington, Jefferson, and Monroe? When the big landowners and rich bankers directly ran the government there was no need for campaign contributions. The need for broadcast advertising means candidates MUST seek money from the rich. So abandon any fantasies of idealism when you read this book. Politicians need money and votes to get elected, and each of these can translate into the other. Money gets things done in Washington by overcoming obstacles (p.12). Lobbyists get things done and collect their share. Different classes and sections have their interests, and legislators try to resolve the differences (p.13). Ever wonder how newspaper and magazine articles are created? See page 18. The red tape and delays of government agencies seem created to require pay-offs (p.20). <br /> <br />Why was Lyndon B. Johnson a powerful Senate Leader? He had files on the personal indiscretions of his Senate colleagues, and a close personal relationship with J. Edgar Hoover (p.55). This allowed LBJ to control a Senator's vote. Page 57 explains the statesmanlike public images of legislators! Another chapter explains how justice works in NY (pp.128-130). Can one crook save himself by discrediting another (p.167)? Would the Establishment save the Speaker of the House (p.172)? Legislators deal with laws that spend millions and can either hurt or help people and businesses (p.128). Lobbying and campaign contributions affect legislators: \\"nothing for nothing\\". Page 184 explains why Big Business gets the big contracts. Page 186 explains why Nixon picked Jerry Ford for Vice-President. Why did House Speaker John McCormack resign from Congress (p.199)? Page 200 shows how political genius finesses a horse breeding bill. Page 205 explains how to fix government decisions in secret. Ever wonder about the purpose of a Washington party? Read page 261 to learn the price tag in government contracts. One hostess worked for tobacco corporations and kept health warnings off cigarette packs (p.268). Wealthy people still want money. Pages 269-270 tell of the lifestyle of the rich and famous, and their women. <br /> <br />Winter-Berger met many of the richest people in the country, and found them to be deadbeats, hypocrites, bigots, and snobs (p.280). Their money allowed them to influence and control politicians on all levels of government. Most politicians are from the middle-class, and are easily corrupted by exposure to the corrupt rich. The rich get the most out of the economy, but do the least for it (p.289). Page 292 tells how to buy a draft deferment. The last chapter summarizes this book. If you think the ruling class will ever change things, you have infantile fantasies (p.308). Why must a good lobbyist also be a lawyer?

Wecht studied the autopsy records of JFK and concluded that the single-bullet theory just couldn't be true (p.13). The forensic evidence says that Sirhan was not the killer of Sen. Robert Kennedy. Wecht was involved in eight of the nine cases in this book, except Jon-Benet Ramsey (p.15). Wecht is a commentator for CNN and other television networks. Some of these cases are well-known. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 tells about the \\"Teenage Baby Killers\\" who faced a first-degree murder charge. These cases happen more often than people imagine. Post partum depression is a legal defense in many countries (p.22). Wecht explains why the infant was stillborn (pp. 35-36). Chapter 2 considers the unsolved murder of Jon-Benet Ramsey based on his review of the medical facts. A supermarket tabloid sent him pictures of the body (p.47).

The pervasive and unfair publicity told of his guilt before the trial. F. Lee Bailey gained national fame in 1964 when he got Dr. Sheppard a new trial. Chapter 5 has the story about the killing of members of a religious sect in 1982 Miracle Valley Arizona. Forensic evidence can determine what happened, and exclude other claims. The events leading to the killing are on pages 160-161. Were Cochise County officials trying to run off the members of the Christ Miracle Church (pp. 165-166)? The lesson learned here could have prevented the Waco Texas massacre of 1993 (p.154). Chapter 6 wonders if Tammy Wynette died of natural causes or as a result of her pain-killers. An immediate autopsy could have provided an answer (p.194). <br /> <br />Chapter 7 discusses the Trials of OJ. Wecht believes the verdicts of both trials were right (p.197)! Was this a \\"great trash novel come to life\\" (p.199)? Was the continuing coverage just a way to fill up cable broadcasting? Wecht was a friend and colleague of the defense lawyers and expert witnesses. [Was this case famous because so many knew the answers but not the facts?] The timeline for the murders is on pages 222-223. Note that the limo driver did not see or hear any car arrive between 10:22 and 11pm. F. Lee Bailey's cross examination was \\"most brilliant and devastating\\" (p.235). Dr. Cyril Wecht now believes the police fabricated the evidence against O. J. Simpson (p.237). [Could Wecht's involvement with TV show business have prevented him from realizing this earlier?] Chapter 8 tells of a Kansas City serial killer who preyed on drug-addicted drifters. None of his victim's bodies were ever found, except for a couple of skulls, the photographs, and Berdella's diary. An insurance company would be liable if these deaths were accidental (p.243)! They settled out of court (p.270). Chapter 9 tells about Robert Curley's poisoning with thallium, which was overlooked in testing for heavy metals (p.272). Poisoning is one of the most difficult crimes to detect (p.277). The hair of the victim was analyzed as a timeline to the poisoning (p.279-280). Who benefited from his death? His wife, who alone had the access during the time he was poisoned (p.285). She wanted the insurance money (p.290). <br /> <br />	2005-01-22

But an argument erupted, and Sharon Barker left Carleton, who slept it off before he left for home. But a Deputy DA was murdered that night, and the police are looking for those who were at that motel! This may affect his wife, his social position, and his job. So Carleton wants Donald Lam to return and pretend he was there that night, since Carleton would have in-law trouble if he went to the police. This red-herring act could be dangerous, but money and the promise of future business wins in the end. Deputy DA Fisher had been prosecuting a murder case, and the police investigation was red-hot. So the meeting occurs, but the detectives recognize Donald Lam, and the security officer knows it wasn't Lam that night. Another plan that goes awry due to an overlooked detail?<br /><br />Donald Lam soon finds out that the police were watching his act, and knew everything except who hired him. Keeping the client's name secret is now a very hot potato (Chapter 6)! Lam returns to the motel room to try to identify the previous occupants (Chapter 8). But more complications and problems arise to advance the plot, and bring in other suspects. Chapter 14 tells what its like to spend the night in a drunk tank. The continuing investigation leads to the solution of Deputy DA Fisher's death, and conviction in the murder case. Cool & Lam keep their license and the monies.<br /><br />Erle Stanley Gardner escaped the formula of the Perry Mason series here. This novel is rawer and grittier, but unlike some short stories of Hammett. The fame and wealth of \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\" required a certain style in the Perry Mason stories. Gardner showed that he could match the pre-war styles of the \\"hard-boiled private eye\\" as he saw it.	2005-01-21

Smith, Warden at the Federal Correctional Institution at Terminal Island California, and has some advice and wisdom on rehabilitating convicts. Gardner says a vindictive punishment is bad because it doesn't rehabilitate prison inmates and leads them to continue the mental attitude that put them in jail. Warden Preston G. Smith tried to provide the fundamentals, vocational and academic training, counseling, etc. Has anything changed over the last fifty years?     The opening chapter tells of a stealth theft from an armored car that was only discovered when the money went missing after the driver and guard stopped for coffee and doughnuts. The \\"Cool & Lam\\" agency gets a visit from Detective Sergeant Sellers because their name and number was found on a piece of paper in a suspect's possession - the alleged girlfriend of a criminal found with half the loot. The police think this money was ordered by a big bookmaker. This girlfriend, Hazel Downer, visits Donald Lam to find her missing husband, and the money she inherited. Coincidentally, this money matches the amount missing in the robbery! [Note how the author builds a complicated case while lightly touching on various human errors.] Chapter 2 gives a quick introduction to the public relations racket and its use in merchandising. Donald Lam follows the clues he discovers. A duplicate trunk is shipped to San Francisco, and Lam follows. Lam meets Hazel and goes for a ride. Their meeting is interrupted by Sergeant Sellers. How will Donald Lam get out of this mess?    Gardner used this pen-name to provide another outlet for his creative talents. This story demonstrates Gardner's skill as a writer of detective stories. Using a continuing series about a fictional person creates a brand and a market for this type of novel. Examples are A. Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming, Patricia Cornwell, and others.	2005-01-21

Her stepmother was found stabbed to death inside her house. The police find a pair of garden shears in the step mom's back. One glove is found outside, its mate is missing. Anne Kimbro's fiancee found the body, and becomes the chief suspect. Anne's step mom objected strongly to her romance with John Leland, due to their parent's relationship. The police are looking for physical evidence, like DNA on John's shirt and handkerchief, to arrest John. We learn that John's father had killed Anne's mother decades earlier. Both families owned stock in a very successful drug company. John's father disappeared after this killing and has never been found! John received a telephone call to his realtor's office, went to this house, met Anne, and they fell in love. But nobody knows who made this call! Perry learns a fact about Iris' past that may be connected to her murder. After the missing bloodstained glove is found hidden away in that house the police arrest John Leland for the murder.  Somebody then sets Anne's house on fire and it burns to the ground, destroying any overlooked evidence. Chapter 17 of this 1991 book explains the new science of DNA testing, which can uniquely identify a person from a bloodstain. Some of the blood found on the victim's body came from John Leland. Then there is videotaped testimony of Benjamin Jantzen, too ill to personally appear in court. The preliminary hearing is interrupted by the news of what was found at the burned down house. Then Anne's stepfather is found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage by John Leland! Chapter 20 has the solution to Anne's mother's murder; it was not John's father. [I found the hints to the real killer.] In Chapter 21 Mason asks the DNA expert if the glove without bloodstains had been tested for DNA; it wasn't [no limb hair?]. Mason wins an acquittal by a hair in Chapter 22. The videotaped confession of the real killer leads to John Leland's acquittal. Mason wonders about the many spectators who congratulate John in Chapter 23. What were their personal motives?  Thomas Chastain was a past president of the Mystery Writers of America and wrote many other books. He was hired by the Erle Stanley Gardner Trust to write this book that follows the original style. There are differences. Usually the first chapter brings in some problem that is followed by a murder. Gardner often mentioned background details about Los Angeles (such as the increasing traffic). I think Chastain lives in another part of the country. There are no details about the lunch in Chapter 6. The drug company that is being sued for a problem with its product is new and good. Anne Kimbro's many romances make her sound like some Hollywood heiress. A wealthy industrialist who uses his political influence against Perry's client seems novel (more likely a newspaper owner). Legal strategy is explained in Chapter 10. Perry &#34;had to drive around the block a couple of times&#34; to find a parking space (Chapter 11) Would Perry drink while working?

Barstow after four months of hard work for a British government agency. After stopping at a hotel for lunch, he could not remember the next 39 days! All he remembers is waking up on a train and finding his passport lost. But the rest of the book fills in the missing story. [The Introduction says this was meant as a parody of stories like from E. Phillips Oppenheim.] Barstow meets a friendly talkative stranger who knows something about him and his remarks on atomic energy. Simon Groom confides in him that the first atomic bomb has been made! Then Groom offers Barstow an important job if he travels to Ixania, a country that is similar to Jugoslavia. <br /> <br />Somehow Professor Barstow is transformed into Conway Carruthers, secret agent, who will travel to Ixania. [There is one big problem with this. It is easier to teach a businessman or scientist to be a spy than to teach a spy to be a businessman or scientist.] Chapter 11 explains how to tap a telephone in a hotel. The newspaper reporter Casey is being used as a confidential agent for some bankers in America, through his contact with Nash. Professor Barstow is working with the Young Peasant Party to help with their planned revolution. [Is this all too incredible? But it is a parody.] There is a happy ending. <br /> <br />This was Eric Ambler's first novel, but not his best. It shows the plot twists that would enrich his later political thrillers. The recurring theme in many is how an ordinary man gets involved in important events, yet survives. The book also tells that carrying a pistol was quite common for travelers before WW II. The idea of an atomic bomb was also known, it just needed hundreds of millions to create one. <br /> <br />	2004-12-31

Gil has been accused of bribing city and state politicians, and being connected to organized crime. A stranger joins him, and they begin to leave. Suddenly, Gil shoots this stranger and takes off in his black Mercedes. The police are called, and go to Adrian's house. They find Gil's wife outside, enter the house, and find Gil dead in the den from two shots to his head! [Gardner always played down the background corruption in his stories. The idea of a double murder popped into to my mind.] Chapter 2 provides an example of wrongful conviction, which happens more often than the dramas on TV would suggest. This is an omen for Chapter 3, where Mrs. Gil Adrian, the trophy wife, retains Perry Mason. Laurel doesn't know much about Gil's business, or of any powerful enemies. Does the political establishment want to hang the murder on Laurel and thus bury the scandal? Mason learns the stranger Gil shot was unidentified; all he had was cash, a phony driver's license, and a .22 pistol strapped to his ankle. Wasn't a .22 pistol the weapon of choice for hit men asks Mason? Mason contacts David Niles, a Federal prosecutor, and suggests an alliance. [This never happened in the original series, to my recollection.]    Chapter 8 tells of the beating that was given to Paul Drake Jr. after he questions Anselmo Costa in Las Vegas. Perry Mason also visits Las Vegas to ask questions, but learns little more. The preliminary hearing in Chapter 19 is as good as Gardner's best. It tells why a defendant shouldn't wear sunglasses. Chapter 20 explains why getting testimony about 'Karl Braundorff' was important. This led to Janet Coleman, a 'roper' (like Raymond Schindler), who told of Gil Adrian's visit to Las Vegas. Then Anselmo Costa is summoned to the witness stand, but he asserts his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Perry Mason gets a clue from the artist drawings on TV. The bank is subpoenaed to find the last check written by Ralph Adrian, Gil's son, before Ralph was murdered. These clues help to solve the puzzle, and Laurel Adrian is freed.    This story brings in updated procedures (the defense gets a list of the prosecutor's witnesses), and mentions the terrible traffic in Los Angeles since the 1960s. But the flavor of the original stories has been lost. Paul Drake has retired, and Perry Mason would be an octogenarian, if still alive. What is missing is a younger lawyer, Perry Jr. or Della Mason, to carry on the father's work. This story is like a good reproduction of an old master like Rembrandt, but in a modern setting. It lacks the dedications that were part of the original series.	2004-12-31

He predicted that ordinary people would soon be visiting these countries via air travel. <br /> <br />Perry Mason and Della Street are dining at a restaurant when Harrington Faulkner approaches and asks to consult about goldfish. Faulkner raises a rare breed, the Veiltail Moor Telescope, and believes his partner has poisoned them. Faulkner is with a beautiful young lady who wants money from this cold, rich married man. If an employee develops a secret cure for gill disease, does it belong to him or his employee? Can the smell of a car's exhaust tell you something (Chapter 7)? <br /> <br />When Perry Mason and Sally Madison return to visit Harrington Faulkner, his wife finds him shot dead. Was Mrs. Faulkner waiting around the corner to giver herself an alibi when her husband's body was found? The length of time a goldfish could live out of water could establish time of death (Chapter 8). The incident in the hotel room tells something about that era (Chapter 9). Perry Mason files a writ of habeas corpus to find Sally Madison, who is being held by the police somewhere (Chapter 13). Mason interviews her in jail to find out what she did, and finally learns the truth. <br /> <br />During the preliminary hearing Sergeant Dorset says the fingerprints were lifted, not photographed first. The places where they were taken from was not identified. [To understand this, refer to the trial for the murder of Sir Harry Oakes, or similar events.] Did the police pick out someone as the guilty party and then disregard any evidence that doesn't fit their presumption? Perry Mason shows his skill when questioning Lt. Tragg about the defendant's fingerprints on the murder weapon and the lack of the earlier possessor of the gun (Chapter 17). After considering the known facts, Perry Mason revisits the person who out-bluffed him before and suggests what must have happened at a corner drug store. This gets a reaction, and Mason call the police. Mason explains the danger of lifting fingerprints, and the likely murderer, in Chapter 19. Sally Madison will be freed, and Perry and Della will celebrate their victory (they are not liable as \\"accessories after the fact\\" for not disclosing their knowledge of Sally's purse). One unusual part of this story is the presence of a victim of tuberculosis, a now forgotten disease. <br />	2004-12-30
409062:US	38002140	R1N9FHVN57CCE1	0679418253	599805840	Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK	Books	2	18	35	N	N	A One-Sided and Biased Book	Case Closed   This book should not be read as a sole source, or an introduction to the topic of the assassination. The 'Preface' states that two-thirds of the public doubted that Oswald acted alone just after Oswald was killed while in police custody (p.ix). THAT is the common sense attitude. Posner doesn't mention the events of the first eleven days that made people skeptical of the Official Explanation. The public knows &#34;that politicians lie and cover up misdeeds while intelligence and military officials plot against the nation they are supposed to protect&#34; (p.x). So what is Posner's problem? Posner's swallowing of the Warren Report is just as foolish as any other outrageous statement of sensational claims. The 'Acknowledgments' thank those who helped Posner, but does not state who advanced the money, and their purposes. Saying Random House &#34;did not care&#34; what the book would conclude doesn't ring true for me.   The 'Bibliography' lacks George O'Toole's &#34;The Assassination Tapes&#34; and Mark North's &#34;Act of Treason&#34;. O'Toole's 1975 book presented the first physical evidence that Oswald was not an assassin, and was followed by the Select Congressional Committee that reopened the investigation. A new generation of books followed. North's book presents the best solution to the assassination, but can't answer questions about the powers behind President Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. Read them for yourself. David Wrone's &#34;The Zapruder Film&#34; presents the best evidence for Oswald's innocence. The picture taken after the first shot does show Oswald in the doorway (that look-alike co-worker was wearing a different shirt - see the picture). The mail-order rifle was wiped clean of fingerprints, wrapped in paper, and hidden among a pile of boxes. There was no gunshot residue on either Oswald's face or hands. Home movies take of the front of the building show neither Oswald or anyone else at the sixth-floor window.   Appendix A says the ammunition was &#34;full metal-jacketed bullets&#34;. The bullet that hit JFK's head exploded into metal grains, according to the X-rays. This bullet could not have been a military &#34;full metal-jacketed bullet&#34; like the only known ammunition for that rifle (CE 399). Posner's &#34;first shot&#34; is a fantasy that assumes a shot was fired THROUGH tree branches! The experienced trauma surgeons at Parkland said the throat wound was an entry wound, and never changed their story. Eyewitness Gov. John Connally always said he was struck by a second shot. Page 482 shows how a faked bullet was created to try to prove the single-bullet theory. Have they no shame?   Appendix B lists many names. After Dorothy Kilgallen died of an &#34;accidental overdose&#34; newspapers said this Hearst reporter had interviewed Ruby in his jail cell and was boasting about breaking this case wide open. Posner offers no proof that she &#34;drank herself to death&#34; (p.494). A few days later her best friend and confidante, Mrs. Earl Smith, was found dead by the same method (p.486). Was this only a coincidence? Note how Posner separated the two events! The story of Albert Bogard shows why an uncorroborated eyewitness could be mistaken (or lying?) about an event. This applies to James Worrell as well; home movies taken at the time do not show this. The link between David Ferrie and Oswald was based on the library card of the former reportedly found in the wallet of the latter. How often does that happen in real life? The 1977 death of George de Mohrenschildt occurred after he was summoned to the House Select Committee on Assassinations. So too the death of William Sullivan. Was this only a coincidence? The above suggests Posner is no better than the other authors he criticizes.   Why is Oswald &#34;not guilty&#34;? He was never convicted or even indicted! Why was he rubbed out two days later? To prevent him from proving his innocence! Lunch time is usually around noon. If Oswald went to lunch at noon and then washed down his meal with a bottle of soda from a machine when that policeman came by. Alive, he could have named the other people who were also in the lunchroom at that time (and they could have confirmed his alibi). Then the conspiracy would be obvious. Being in the second floor lunchroom solves the problem of hiding that rifle then running down four flights of stairs. Yes, this is my assumption, but it best explains the problem of Oswald's movements from the sixth to the second floor.   Another argument for Oswald's innocence is his denial of shooting the President. The killers of Presidents in the 19th century all boasted of their deed. So too those in the 20th century who attempted and failed. All used a pistol. Was Oswald lying about this? George O'Toole's book &#34;The Assassination Tapes&#34; explains why Oswald was telling the truth (or was crazy). The idea of a conspiracy also explains the differences in wounds seen in Parkland Hospital and those on the body in Bethesda. I think the conspirators simply sacrificed JFK's double to create a body whose wounds would fit the &#34;lone gunman&#34; theory. Why did the Establishment bump him off? JFK's use of drugs affected his judgment and risked a Nuclear War in October 1962. The book &#34;Dr. Feelgood&#34; explains JFK's health problems. Doesn't this theory best fit the known facts?	2004-12-29

He researched the history of this country before he left London. When he arrived, his contact Pashik warned him against offending the authorities, and their censorship. Foster goes to interview Madame Deltchev, and her daughter asks him to hand-deliver a letter (Chapter 7). Deltchev was accused of being a member of the \\"Officer Corp Brotherhood\\", a secret organization that used terrorism for its political ends (Chapter 8). Many members were Government officials, or from every class except ordinary workmen. Foster is approached by an agent-provocateur who offers a secret way to send out a message; forewarned, Foster declines. When Foster tries to hand-deliver that letter, he finds a dead body! Next he is found there by Pashik! Pashik tells Foster to tell no one, or return to the Deltchev home. <br /> <br />Foster continues to blunder about, and finds Sibley in Pashik's apartment. Foster tells Sibley all he knows, and finds out that Sibley knows more (Chapter 17)! Pashik helped to roll-up the Brotherhood; and who was the hidden owner of Pashik's agency. Upon his return to the hotel Foster is arrested and interrogated by the Minister of Information, who tells him to leave the country, or else.

Perry Mason and Della Street are on a vacation in Palm Springs when John L. Witherspoon asks for advice regarding his daughter Lois. Mr. Witherspoon disapproves of his daughter's boyfriend Marvin, and wants to end their romance. This requires Mason to re-investigate the trial of Marvin's father.

There are complications arising from that 18-year old murder trial, and the unknown &#34;Miss X&#34; of that time. Coincidences pop up among the characters in this story.  Chapter 17 points out the fickleness of public opinion. Marvin was president of his class, editor of the school paper. Popular and successful in college, and well-liked. But if they find out his father was a convicted murderer, what then? John L. Witherspoon retained the best local trial lawyer in the valley.

Coincidences pop up among the characters in this story.<br /><br />Chapter 17 points out the fickleness of public opinion. Marvin was president of his class, editor of the school paper. Popular and successful in college, and well-liked. But if they find out his father was a convicted murderer, what then? John L. Witherspoon retained the best local trial lawyer in the valley. The Preliminary Hearing in Chapter 19 presents a \\"locked room murder\\" of Mr. Burr. Paul Drake's investigations reveal new facts. Mason is hired by Witherspoon and begins cross-examining witnesses. In a meeting in the Judge's chambers Mason draws the connections from the known facts to point to a solution of the murders. Perry and Della continue their vacation at a new location. This book documents those times, and leaves some events implied rather than explicit.	2004-12-22

There is no index. Chapter 1 tells how he became an expert witness when treating a patient as a neurologist. Chapter 2 tells of a sad case on iatrogenic water intoxication. Most malpractice cases involve average doctors who made a mistake (p.38). Chapter 3 tells why you have to ask the right questions to get the right answers. Chapter 4 discusses the EEGs of Jack Ruby. The importance of winning for an expert witness is in Chapter 5. One of the most important chapters is on carotid stenosis in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 explains the importance or reading labels on laundry products and following their instructions. \\"Therapeutic Misadventure\\" is explained in Chapter 8; did Dr. Parks refer Mrs. Schwartz to Dr. Cooper by mistake? Sleep drunkenness is explained in Chapter 9, and its consequences (pp.136-137). <br /> <br />Chapter 10 tells of a woman who had difficulty falling, she said. The rare third-nerve injury is explained in Chapter 11, and the difference between fiction and a scientific article. Chapter 12 tells of the Trial of Dan White, who shot the San Francisco mayor and another politician. The trial record has been impounded! Chapter 13 explains tardive dyskinesia, an iatrogenic disease caused by long-term exposure to drugs used to treat schizophrenia. No treatment may mean years of psychosis. If you want to know the reason for malpractice suits, read Chapter 13. It has both the good and the bad. Chapter 14 examines the \\"insanity\\" of Ezra Pound. Dr. Klawans does not appreciate the reactionary politics of that era. If a woman uses birth control pills, smoking increases the chances of having a stroke. This can create aphasia (Chapter 15). <br /> <br />Chapter 16 explains the disease dystonia. Dr. Klawans explained how hysteria could be mistake for this disease when the patient could gain from this disease. Could somebody escape from the police by checkinginto a hospital room as an AIDS patient (p.245)? The dangers of lead poisoning for children are documented in Chapter 17. Drugs, as well as premature birth, can affect a child's brain permanently. The dangers of smoking too much too long are described in Chapter 18. This is one cause of emphysema. This leads to a buildup of blood CO2 levels. But the real cause of death was human error (p.271)! The last chapter tells of a woman who had an accident in a federal office building, and began to feel tired and sleepy a lot (a common sigh of depression). The clothes worn by Dr. Klawans swayed the federal judge! Is this a warning against an inquisitorial system where the judge is also the jury? <br /> <br />	2004-12-19

This novel is set in a former colony of the Netherlands East Indies, and is from the viewpoint of a English engineer. Revolution was followed by loans to develop a dam for hydroelectricity. Comments about a new government in Chapter 1 are very wise, and can find parallel events in other countries. The new Government is threatened by some from the former united front; this is complicated by the hatred against the former colonial masters. The engineering company must hire \\"liaison managers\\" who were nominated by the government for these new jobs. Some people had friends among both the Government and the insurgents. In Chapter 4 Steve Frazer finds himself in the middle of a rebellion. His hotel is attacked by bombers from the air force, and flooding prevents the radio station from operating. Frazer uses his engineering background to fix the generator and makes himself useful. This is all part of a clever plot to eliminate the rebels by provoking an attack that leaves the attackers vulnerable to a counter-attack. An old, old trick that works again. <br /> <br />This is another story of an average person who is caught in the political conflict of his times. He survives in part because of his good manners, and the story requires it. <br /> <br />	2004-12-15

A band of terrorists were ambushed and killed near a rubber plantation. The tin mine nearby was long closed. The clerk Krishnan is looking to go into business as a bus owner; but he will need thousands of pounds in capital. Could he find a hidden treasure and profit from this experience? Chapter I tells what happened. Chapter II introduces Mr. Tan, owner of a shipping company, trucks and boats. He knows people and has connections. We meet the American front man in Chapter III, and his wife. Chapter IV tells how to securely handle a business deal: give a postdated check and a receipt for the goods, and receive a promissory note for the amount of the check. This should prevent a double-cross. <br /> <br />Chapter V describes tourist life in Singapore. A journalist wants to interview Greg Nilsen, and takes him to lunch. Chapter VI tells of the trip to Indonesia oil country, and a secret meeting. A problem arises. Greg & Dorothy interface with the Indonesian Government in Chapter VII. A raid on the prison occurs in Chapter VIII; Greg and Dorothy are freed as hostages are exchanged. Greg asks advice from Colonel Soames in Chapter IX, and Greg's deal is finalized. Chapter X has a somewhat happy ending for the principals. A new public transport company is started, and Krishnan is the partner-manager. <br /> <br />This novel weaves historical facts into an amusing and entertaining story. The moral is that tourists on vacation should not meddle in another country's business or politics. <br />	2004-12-13

Seemingly poor, her estate had over $3,000,000 (1938 dollars!). The law said any blood-relation could be entitled to a share; else it would revert to the state. A law firm was appointed administrator of the estate; they collected fees in their search for the rightful heirs. Thousands filed claims, and there had to be evaluated. The only relatives found would be in Germany, the origin of her parents. A lawyer was sent there in 1939, but the War prevented a settlement. The Nazis forged documents for one claimant in Dresden. Now in 1949 a new young lawyer is assigned to re-investigate the tons of documents and provide a final solution. Young George Carey interviews the now retired lawyer who previously investigated the claims. Carey now travels to Western Germany, hires an interpreter, and looks for a Schneider or a Schirmer (original name). If a Swiss citizen, then the inheritance would not be forfeit as Alien Property. <br /> <br />The official records said Franz Schneider was missing in action and presumed dead in 1944 Greece. But he could have survived and joined the guerrillas. So Carey travels to Greece to continue his search; that comes to a literal dead end. We are told of the historical events of that time. Something happens that draws Carey to further meetings. But what if the heir doesn't want to be found? This book explains what a court-appointed administrator does; so be sure to have a will. This is another story where an individual gets snagged in the gears of government; they survive by their self-reliance. To understand the ending you must know about the German laws of that era regarding nationality. <br />	2004-12-11

Chapter 1 gives his short autobiography as to why he became an anthropologist, and his experiences in Kenya. A forensic pathologist is a medical doctor trained in pathology. A forensic anthropologist has a Ph.D. and studied anthropology, specializing in the human skeletal system. Chapter 3 tells about his laboratory, and the tools used for his work. Chapter 4 has many of the cases he worked on. Chapter 5 notes that most dismemberments result from the drug trade or motorcycle gangs. The Interstate Highway System provides arteries for crimes and serial killers. (p.63). Chapter 6 discusses cases of suicide. Many people kill themselves without intending to. It is important to distinguish between murder and suicide (p.86). Page 87 tells why Florida has an inordinate number of suicides. Chapter 7 explains how forensic anthropology developed in response to murders. This chapter discusses some famous cases of this relatively young science. Page 101 tells how to distinguish between bone from rock by taste! Chapter 8 says bones are not solid and unchanging, they are constantly reshaping themselves. <br /> <br />In Chapter 9 Maples tells of the use of capital punishment (p.128), and discusses the various methods (pp.129-131). He seems emotionally involved. Chapter 10 informs us about cremation. Chapter 11 has Maples' most difficult and most fascinating and perplexing case. The two dead in High Springs FL were linked to a shocking double murder in New Hampshire (p.152). Page Jennings' parents made a big, fatal mistake in sending their daughter so far away after her failure as a freshman (p.164). Chapter 12 deals with the MIA in Vietnam, about 2200 compared to the 8170 in Korea. Hollywood movies created this popular image of captured men (p.187). A \\"delusion\\" (p.188)? Maples describes the US Army Central Identification Laboratory that identifies remains recovered from Vietnam. Page 202 tells what happened at the Executive Office Building. Chapter 13 tells of his investigation to recognize the skeleton of Pizarro, and correct an old mistake. The exhumation of President Zachary Taylor and the tests for arsenic poisoning are told in Chapter 14. Page 224 tells of his importance to those times: he backed free states in the new territories. His replacement changed his policies. <br /> <br />Chapter 15 may be the most historically important. Maples was part of a team that identified the bones of Tsar Nicholas and his family. Maples draws political conclusions from \\"rotten, neglected teeth\\" (p.259). Chapter 16 tells of the murder of five college students over two days in Gainesville Florida. Maples identified the murder weapon (pp.271-273). The book concludes with the complaint that states are not funding forensic anthropologists, who are few and far between, especially in Florida (pp.278-279). Florida is \\"the most crime-ridden state in the Union\\". That is a political decision for each state government. This recalls the most realistic portion of \\"Quincy, M.E.\\": whenever Quincy wanted to do more research, his manager often said \\"there's no money in the budget\\"! <br /> <br />	2004-12-09

There was a faith in social, scientific, and technological progress dating from the 19th century (p.3). For millennia, diseases killed more people than war and famine. Since the 1960s new diseases appeared, and old ones reappeared as resistant to drugs. One cause was the high-speed travel from airplanes. This is similar to the 19th century spread of cholera by trains and steamboats. Infection and disease are as old as life. Man's modification of his environment affects other life, and his own. Germs and microbes also change. The tsetse fly's presence in ancient North America corresponds roughly with the extinction of horses (p.19). <br /> <br />Karlen suggests that hunting and meat eating allowed humans to progress (p.22). Leaving the tropics for temperated climates avoided the parasites that still hinder development. But eating wild game can cause problems (p.24). Pages 26-28 tell of Neanderthal man, more advanced than cartoon drawings. The Agricultural Revolution produced greater plenty and more infections; these changes are inseparable and still occur together (p.29). Plant and animal foods leave distinctive chemical signatures in human bones, as do proteins from marine and land animals (pp.32-33). Going from hunting to farming brought declining health and increasing diseases (p.34). New diseases arose: occupational, nutritional, and infectious (p.35). Intestinal helminths may have caused more damage than the more dramatic viral and bacterial plagues (p.37). Domesticated animal brought new diseases (p.39). Farming created new breeding grounds for malaria, organic fertilizers spread both old and new diseases (p.41). Helminth diseases and intestinal infections create a population sapped of energy and disease resistance (p.42). [Recall Richard Henry Dana's comments on New Englanders who settled in Spanish California; \\"laid back\\" could be a medical condition.] The Mystery Disease of Pudoc should be a warning against food imported from Third World countries like Asia (p.44-45). We already know about Mad Cow Disease in Great Britain. This is another warning against \\"raw fish\\" or raw meat. Once one person has this disease, it can be spread by the local fish! <br /> <br />Reading this book will provide a short history of how diseases affected human history. Some of it may be known to you, but the book has it all in 230 pages. The Bibliography has extensive references for each chapter. The Index allows a quick reference to the many topics in this interesting book. Page 140 tells how more abundant proteins from meat and dairy products reduced infections and mortality. [Remember this the next time you read vegetarian propaganda in a newspaper or magazine. They have a hidden agenda for their advertisers.] Measles and smallpox were biological weapons of colonialism (p.59). The Imperialism (or Globalism) of the Roman Empire was followed by new epidemics from the disease pools of Europe, Africa, India, and China (p.65). Will we see this repeated in the 21st century, and be followed by a new Dark Age? <br />	2004-12-01

It provides security in an otherwise insecure economy. This is why it has enormous public support. It is threatened by the deceitful lies and misinformation from a propaganda campaign designed to damage or destroy it. The authors provide the basic facts to inform people of the truth about Social Security. The greatest threat to Social Security come from those who want to destroy it in order to save it (or so they say).    The 'Introduction' says the forecasts of a shortfall for future generations is based on the assumption of an annual growth rate that is half the rate recorded over the past three decades. If the current growth rates do not fail, the system would never run short of money (p.1). The truth is that class warfare has resulted in a real decline in pay since President Reagan took office (p.2). This has created a malaise in people's expectations, due to the well-orchestrated political arguments against Social Security (p.3). This attack lumps Medicare with Social Security to project a huge deficit. But it is Medicare that has the problem due to the lack of cost control (which would be solved by Universal Health Care). Social Security will produce annual surpluses for decades (p.5). America spends twice as much on health care as Sweden, yet Sweden has a much higher percentage of people over 65 (p.6). Sweden has \\"socialized medicine\\" and no corrupt Health Maintenance Organizations.    The Bubble in the Stock Market has burst, and destroyed the arguments of those who want to loot Social Security (p.7). But faster growth rates eliminate shortfalls in Social Security (p.8). Stocks are only valuable if there are profits and dividends. If prices rise, they will fall when there is no rise in the underlying assets. The real truth is that privatized accounts would earn about 2.5% (p.9)! Those who claim investing small amounts over decades will create great wealth have never done so, nor canthey point to anyone who has ever done so. Its all just a fantasy.    The idea of raising the retirement age is crazy, given the class lines of life expectancy, and the increasing policies of dumping older workers who must retire at 62 (p.10). Another regressive policy is cutting the cost of living adjustment, which is needed for devalued dollars (p.11). The declining real wages refute this crackpot idea of the Boskin Commission (p.12). Social Security is the largest and most successful antipoverty program. It provides a guaranteed annuity that is inflation resistant, unlike many pensions (p.13). Social Security is most efficiently administered (no private mismanagement). Social Security is more important than ever due to the class warfare from the 1980s. Employer pension plans are going away, and regressive tax laws reduce private savings for retirement (p.14).    The proposed cuts to \\"fix\\" Social Security are shown to be neither just or justifiable, or even necessary. The high 6.2% tax rate (really double that) is being used to lower taxes on the super-rich. Wall Street pays for this propaganda campaign (p.16). Much has been said about deficits, but little about the problem of increasing inequality in the distribution of income (p.17). The national debt is a trick where the many are taxed to benefit the few super-rich. The rest of this book covers the \\"phony crisis\\" in detail.	2004-11-30

It is broad-based among thousands of laboratories. Much of it is thoughtless or frivolous. This work is unregulated and has no oversight among scientists. The author has projected these principles into this novel. What if extinct dinosaurs were recreated today? Crichton uses his scientific knowledge and talented imagination to create another best seller. A producer, John Hammond, uses scientific talent and piles of money to fulfill his plan; how could anything go wrong? Who was watching the reality to see if it matched the plan? Is there a practical use for dinosaurs? Will he perish, like Victor Frankenstein, at the hands of his creation? <br /> <br />Both crocodiles and sharks have been around since the Triassic age, roughly 220 million years ago. Would there be any problems is dinosaurs were to be recreated? Don't all plans contain simplifying assumptions and outdated data? Reading this book will give you the background to better understand the 1993 film, and the sequels. The book is better than the film, which is a simplified version of the book. There is a fad for dinosaurs among children. Perhaps a comic book version of the film would educate them? <br />	2004-11-30

It has a relatively simple and concise story. The 1941 film is a condensed version of this book, with some changes for the manners of the times. Like other novels, it begins when a client visits the detective agency and asks them to investigate \\"Floyd Thursby\\". Miles Archer takes the job, but is ambushed and killed in a dark alley. Soon after this the body of Floyd Thursby is found. \\"Miss Wonderly\\" is the only clue, and Sam Spade investigates; her name is Brigid O' Shaughnessy [note initials]. Brigid has a hidden past. Joel Cairo shows up and hires Spade to find the black bird, \\"no questions will be asked\\". This statuette represents great wealth to the seekers. [Is this a satire on the 1920s?] Spade goes to a meeting with Casper Gutman to discuss recovery of the black bird. Chapter 13 gives a history of the black bird as Gutman knows it. But Spade makes an assumption. Things happen, Spade travels to various scenes in his search.  When Spade returns home, he finds Brigid, and then the others laying in wait for him. They have a talk, and Spade finally figures out the solution to Archer's murder. The last chapters are full of talk, but this is needed to solve the murder. Spade acts as a \\"roper\\", an agent who plays along with the guilty. The appearance of Gutman's daughter in Chapter 17 is to plant a false clue; no further mention of her in the book. The 1941 film simplifies this event.  The ending reminds me of Agatha Christie's \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\". It would have been better all around if Hammett continued his novels about \\"Sam Spade\\", as Raymond Chandler did with \\"Philip Marlowe\\". Hammett squandered his time and talent in various self-indulgent activities. Note the right to keep and bear arms in San Francisco then.	2004-11-27

Forensic science is \\"the study and practice of the application of science to the purposes of the law\\". Page 4 gives Newcomb's Rule, but provides no proof of verification. Eyewitness evidence is subjective and colored by attitudes and perceptions. If a witness is mistaken or lying, there is no way to tell. Physical evidence is objective, but may have subjective aspects. [The authors ignore the topic of planted evidence. They don't tell that expert witnesses support the side that pays them.] Forensic science dates from the early 19th century with modern chemistry and toxicology. Mistaken identification can occur from photographs as well as live persons (p.7). The paragraph on firearms examination omits the pioneering work done in Germany and first used by Earl Rogers in California (p.10). The paragraph on questioned document examination ignores work done in Europe centuries earlier (p.11). Page 14 tells that government forensic laboratories are usually unavailable to the defense. The book \\"Tainted Evidence\\" explains why this is a problem due to the lack of objectivity.    Chapter 2 explains the techniques of \\"Crime Scene Investigation\\". Fingerprints should be photographed before lifting (p.28). This prevents planting evidence, as in the Trial of Alfred de Marigny. The Case Study is the Jeffrey Macdonald case. I read that Cyril Wecht M.D., J.D. said some of his wounds could not be self-inflicted; the book \\"Fatal Justice\\" gives more details. This may not be the best example for a textbook case. Chapter 4 says placing firearms \\"in the hands of the peasant class\\" resulted in murders! Like with Robin Hood? The case study is the Sacco-Vanzetti trial (a controversial case - see page 103). Dr. Henry C. Lee's \\"Famous Crimes Revisited\\" says \\"the custody of all the bullets had never been traced\\". This case study proves Sacco & Vanzetti innocent IMO. One robber shot Berardelli, then chased Parmenter and shot him twice. The other robber shot Berardelli three times. But only one of the bullets submitted in evidence came from Sacco's gun! This suggests evidence planted to convict Sacco & Vanzetti. A third robber jumped into the getaway car that had two other men. This sounds like professionals who had a plan and left no witnesses. Were Sacco & Vanzetti posthumously rehabilitated by the State of Massachusetts? Chapter 7 covers questioned document examination. Suppose a suspect is asked to copy a ransom note 'to prove his innocence'. If somehow this becomes the state's evidence, would that prove innocence?    Chapter 8 tells about blood, the substance most commonly found at the crime scene, or on a person, clothing, or weapon. Tests to identify blood have been known since 1875 using various chemicals, to today's use of DNA. The case study is the O. J. Simpson trial, the most publicized case since Dr. Sam Sheppard. The authors admit \\"it would have been possible later to switch the collected evidence for faked evidence\\" (p.207). The Medical Examiner who did the autopsies on Nicole and Ron testified the forensic evidence said the murders occurred after 11pm. The red liquid blood was still leaking down the sidewalk when the police arrived at 12:15am (suggesting murder around 11:45pm). Since the limousine driver picked up OJ at 11pm, Simpson could not have personally murdered Ron and Nicole. The glove and blood evidence were both planted. Read Steven Singular's \\"Legacy of Deception\\" for the details. The 'Los Angeles Times' in June 1996 reported that the lead detective took blood samples from the morgue before evidence was turned in for analysis.	2004-11-27

Its history is obscure before the 14th century. Forty American scientists spent four years running thousands of scientific tests on the Shroud. These scientists had backgrounds in branches of physics, biology, and chemical sciences. Dr. Heller has a doctorate in medicine and has been a professor of internal medicine and medical physics at Yale. He is a Southern Baptist, and a skeptical scientist. He first heard of the Shroud of Turin in 1978. The image is anatomically correct, the pathology and physiology represent medical knowledge unknown before the 19th century (p.2). The report by forensic pathologists paralleled the Gospel accounts. Investigating a controversial subject could affect your \\"scientific research\\" (p.11). What a comment on \\"objective science\\"! But Dr. Heller regarded the subject as a rare challenge, and became involved. The Catholic Church has never proclaimed it as the shroud of Jesus of Nazareth. <br /> <br />Most major discoveries in science have been made by young investigators (p.23). They are wiling to test new ideas, and experiment. The investigation of the Shroud required a diverse scientific background (pp.36-7). Preparing for the tests in Turin required a test session in Connecticut. Dr. Heller tells of the fortunate coincidences (p.89). Chapter 6 tells of the political machinations from their rivals in Turin; rivalry isn't just in business (p.91). It also describes the technical difficulties in setting up the tests. After the 120 hours of testing in secret was finished, the analysis of the results began. <br /> <br />Chapter 9 explains how they tested the 700 picograms of red substance. The Soret band test showed that this was old acid methemoglobin from old blood. Chapter 10 tells of the meeting of scientists in Colorado Springs. To create the older form of gelatin, they cooked rat tails! A lot of timeand effort was spent investigating the anomalous claim of one expert. Mankind is no smarter today than 50,000 years ago. Someone could have figured out something that was thought recently discovered (p.169). Was the Shroud a painting? Six different tests, each acceptable in a court of law, prove the presence of blood on the Shroud (p.186). It was human (p.188). The iron oxide on the Shroud did not contain contaminants; it came from retting or from blood (p.196). Contrary claims were never tested chemically (p.196)! Page 202 tells of the difficulties in creating a picture. The Emperor Constantine outlawed crucifixion in the fourth century (p.204). Artistic depictions are medically incorrect, but not the Shroud. The thousand experiments they performed were published by the Canadian Society of Forensic Sciences. An experiment with a glass table simulated the image (p.208). Scourge marks were only visible in UV light (p.210). The STURP team did not find anything to question the authenticity of the Shroud, or the Gospel accounts. How did the images get on the cloth? They just did not know (p.218). Was it the authentic burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth? There is no scientific test for that (p.219). Page 220 sums up the results. Of the thousands of other shrouds known, none have any image of any kind. The preponderance of scientific test overrules any contrary claims, such as the claim it was painted on. This book lacks an index. <br />	2004-11-23

Names have been changed, and some are composite characters. The stories try to give the reality behind the job descriptions. They want to demystify the jargon, and describe the caste system of Internet business. This is not too different from a white-collar factory of office workers IMO. There may be more open antagonism though (pp. 31-32). I once heard that you should never be late for a meeting since the others would gossip about you. The story about \\"Jane\\" on page 96 confirms this, and shows she didn't understand \\"office politics\\". Is golf the rich-guy equivalent of bowling (p.102)? A way to create back-channel links and friendships? <br /> <br />One warning is that long hours results in lower pay (p.136). Another warning is about using your own money to create a product for a company (Chapter 7.3). The story in Chapter 8.3 reminds me of a motivational speaker who spoke of Free Enterprise, but was a tenured professor at a state college! The story in Chapter 9.3 shows how wear and aging combine against the best intentions. Burnout from pride and arrogance? That's only human!

The German Navy used a version of Enigma that defied code breakers in the early years of the war. After key documents were captured by the British, they were able to decode the messages. This book tells this story in about 360 pages, with an index and bibliography. The 'Preface' lists the acknowledgments. The Battle of Britain failed to defeat the British, next came the Battle of the Atlantic to destroy supply ships. The British used ASDIC and RADAR to detect submarines, but this had a limited range. Only decoded German naval messages would locate the submarines, and allow a convoy to avoid them. The U-boats were controlled by radio from France with constant communication. When a damaged U-boat surfaced, the captain of the attacking British destroyer decided to board it and capture its codebooks. <br /> <br />Chapter 3 tells of the history of the Enigma cypher machine. Necessity is the mother of invention. Chapter 4 tells how this perfectly unbreakable system began to be broken: it use by imperfect men (p.69). The prohibition against keys with repeated letters provided a guide to cryptanalysts (p.70)! Chapter 7 reminds us that intelligence is secondary to strength (p.91). The sinking of U-33 led to the recovery of three rotors (p.111). Since small German ships did not use Enigma but a code known to the British, the latter were used to decode the former (p.144). The capture of the U-110 and its Enigma, ocean charts, and coding keys was priceless (Chapter 13). The capture of a weather ship brought a new supply of key settings (Chapter 14). Warnings of U-boats saved convoys (Chapter 15). Capturing a cipher book from the U-559 allowed breaking the new four-rotor code (Chapter 19). Chapter 20 tells how one convoy evaded U-boats. The cavity magnetron allowed ultra-high frequency radar which could not be detected by U-boats (Chapter 21). The Nazis believed this explained the Allies' success (p.261).  <br /> <br />The operational efficiency of U-boats was improved by having them resupplied at sea by special submarine tankers (Chapter 22). Sinking one reduced the effectiveness of many U-boats. The use of escort carriers allowed active attacks on U-boats, not just defensively (p.267). Sinking these supply ships and U-boats won the Battle of the Atlantic. ULTRA was the greatest secret of World War II (p.276). It could both avoid the enemy, and lead to an attack, with a minimal force. Another important factor was the huge production from American shipyards and aircraft factories. [Unmentioned is the war on the Eastern front, which required most Nazi military forces.] The British and Americans used a five or ten rotor machine with a more complex motion; and total censorship of this (p.279). The motivation for intelligence is described on pages 280-281. Another factor for efficiency was that American and British forces cooperated, while Germany had seven major code-breaking agencies that operated separately. A similar comparison could be made to the intelligence agencies. The British were unified, the Germans had competitive agencies. This book provides a short history, but I think it omitted areas for space considerations. <br />	2004-11-20

Cliff writes with a 'stream of consciousness' style that would be faster reading with a more concise style. [Is this a  bureaucratic style?] The book describes the lifestyle of University serfs: eating a lot of pizza, bicycling around, living with friends, and sewing quilts. The big event of the year seems to be dressing up for a Halloween parade in San Francisco.  <br /> <br />This book lacks a Table of Contents and an Index. This is worth reading as a slow-paced real detective story; it is unlike fictional detective stories. One lesson is the care needed when talking over a phone line (the \\"F\\" entity). Were his comments on an uncaring Federal bureaucracy echoed in the aftermath reports of 9/11/? The personal activities of Cliff and his friends show them to be 'dedicated followers of fashion' who imagine themselves to be radically original. [Some of this was done decades earlier.] American telephones are computer controlled so they are easy to trace. <br /> <br />Cliff was asked about the \\"adiabatic lapse rate on Jupiter\\". This wasn't \\"by chance\\", but a test of his bona fides (Chapter 45). Chapter 47 explains how to  decrypt Unix passwords from dictionary words. Plodding through this book was tedious to me; he could have been more concise. Cliff claims the problem with viruses is they destroy trust, as he was later questioned about a virus. That was a sort of left-hand compliment, or hidden jealousy IMO. My advice is: trust no one. <br /> <br />	2004-11-20

But their personal flaws often handicap their race for success. Ralph Pressman owned a successful company, but did not quite own his trophy wife. His choice of bookkeeper was also flawed. They are all introduced in short paragraphs that describe their character (or lack thereof). The goal is to profit from the oil rights on many small farms and ranchs. But Pressman has a powerful rival in George Karper, who has influence on Pressman's bookkeeper. <br /> <br />District Attorney Frank Duryea and his wife Milred are visited by her Gramps Wiggins because of gasoline and tire rationing. The old rascal smuggled in sugar from Mexico. Constable Carl Gentry tells Duryea of the trouble that will result from Pressman's oil drilling. The problem for them is that the voters will remember in November what they do today. [Isn't democracy great?] Gramps believes that this is still a free country, and you can do anything you like, as long as they don't catch you! <br /> <br />There is a rumor that the new chicken farm owner, Jack Reedley, is really Ralph Pressman. But Reedley is found dead, and the police begin the investigation. The \\"smoking chimney\\" refers to the oil lamp in the cabin. Can the oil consumed tell how long it was lit? Gramps Wiggins thinks so. When DA Duryea says the autopsy surgeon gave an estimate, Gramps points out they were wrong in the Thelma Todd case. <br /> <br />Gardner was showing his writing skill in this novel, as if to answer critics of his Perry Mason series. Chapter 26 describes a glib politician who always has a solution after the problem arises. Has that changed? As in later works, Gardner describes (and implicitly criticizes) the manners and morals of his times. \\"Perry Mason\\" was based partly on Gardner's own career as a lawyer. \\"Gramps Wiggins\\" seems to be based on Gardner's hobby as a tourist, down to the home-built trailer. <br /> <br />	2004-11-18

No dates are mentioned, but the presence of a wounded soldier says WW II. Tire rationing is mentioned, plus the implications of owning two new tires. Doctors made house calls. Vincent Blane, store owner and banker, has two daughters. One is married to Jake Hardisty, the other is seeing Harley Raymond, a Purple Heart winner. We find out that Jack Hardisty has stolen a huge sum of money from his father-in-law's bank. Adele Blane and Harley are at the cabin when Jack arrives; they leave. When Harley returns, he later finds Jack's body in a bedroom. No murder weapon, or money. Other people are brought into this story, neighbors who could be suspects. The police are called and begin their investigation. Perry Mason is hired to defend Millicent, Jack's widow, who had been seen near the cabin and has no alibi. Her .38 revolver was found near the cabin. Was it the murder weapon?<br /><br />When the trial begins, the autopsy surgeon testifies that scopolamine was found in Jake's body. It is used as a \\"truth serum\\". The estimated time of death was between 7:30pm and 10:00pm. Can the age of a person be determined from a \\"spectacle lens\\"? Were the other people who were around at the time of the murder just innocently passing by? Finding two revolvers complicates the case, as well as the buried alarm clock. But Perry Mason figures out what really happened. A negative in a camera is not definitive proof, unless you can be sure when it was taken. The trial is adjourned, and Millicent is not convicted. Can an alarm clock do more than tell time?	2004-11-14

As special counsel to a convicted murderer awaiting execution he found new evidence and argued this case to get a reversal of conviction by the Louisiana Supreme Court.<br /><br />A contractor is getting grief from building inspectors on a very important job. He is advised to consult with a \\"public relations expert\\" (who quotes a price to fix the problems). As Ansley leaves the estate, he has a narrow escape from an accident; the other car overturns. Ansley sees a young woman, who calls for help and a ride home to her apartment. But something worries him. He calls on Perry Mason for advice. When Perry checks up, he finds this woman used a false identity; and her car was stolen. The next day the \\"public relations expert\\" is found murdered; the gun that did is found in Ansley's car. Perry Mason and Paul Drake must quickly investigate to uncover the facts. They track down the woman from the fake address (using a real person's identity can provide a clue to the imposter). An undeveloped negative of the model is found in the murdered man's camera (is it proof she was the last person to see him alive?).<br /><br />Using the facts uncovered by the investigation Perry Mason gets the charges against Ansley dropped at the preliminary hearing. The model is arrested for the murder; she worked at the store where the murder weapon was stolen. But she hires Perry Mason as her advocate, and Perry Mason gets the charges dropped again! By now the facts develop to point to the real killer. The remarks of Lieutenant Tragg on driving to avoid accidents are still valuable.<br />If you can only read one Perry Mason mystery, this provides a good example of Erle Stanley Gardner's stories.	2004-11-12
461611:US	38002140	R39RH0FF3LG6DQ	0684853396	977410269	Day of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor	Books	5	23	32	N	N	What Did They Know and When Did They Know It?	To the many uninformed, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was a devastating surprise. To those knowledgeable, it was not. The author claims that the US Government carefully orchestrated a series of moves to create this attack. Historians learned that some knowledge or warnings of this were known in advance. Dusko Popov's 1972 book tells how he and Ian Fleming visited J. Edgar Hoover in July 1941 to tell of Axis interest in the defenses of Pearl Harbor. The author served in the Navy under Lieutenant George Bush, and earned ten battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation. After he retired as a photographer and journalist in 1986, he devoted his time to research and writing this book.  Appendix A has Lieutenant Commander Arthur McCollum's proposed eight actions of October 7, 1940 designed to provoke Japan into attacking. Allying with Britain, Holland, and China; sending heavy cruisers and submarines to the Orient; keeping the fleet in Hawaii; refuse selling oil to Japan; and a trade embargo with Japan. Stinnett does not question America's entry into the war, or even the manipulation to force the Japanese attack. He just wanted to reveal what actually happened; a scoop by a reporter. During 1941 a Japanese spy surveyed Pearl Harbor as a target. His last message on December 6 said it was ready for a surprise attack (p.85). All the time he was watched by Naval Intelligence! The FBI wiretapped the telephones of the Japanese consulate (p.86). But Admiral Kimmel was not informed (p.95). In August 1941 this spy established grid coordinates to prepare for the attack. Their transmissions were intercepted and decoded (p.99). Yet Admiral Kimmel and General Short were not informed (p.107). Did a Rear Admiral leave his ship Saturday to be safe at home Sunday (p.111)?  In early November 1941 Ambassador Joseph Grew warned that Japan decided on war with America (pp.143-4). After Admiral Kimmel ordered a search for Japanese forces north of Hawaii, the White House countermanded hisorder (p.145). This book is so rich in details that is can't be easily summarized here. Except to note that if Kimmel and Short were kept in the loop, the attack on Pearl Harbor would not have been a surprise. The imperialist conflicts between Japan and Britain, China, and Holland spread like a forest fire. But &#34;the United States desires that Japan commit the first overt act&#34; (p.282). The 'Epilogue' summarizes this book.  &#34;The Wrath To Come&#34; is the title of an E. Phillips Oppenheim novel written in the mid 1920s. Reflecting the politics of that time, this novel suggested a plan for a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and attacks by Germany and Russia along the Atlantic seaboard.	2004-11-09

The strange voice identifies himself as her long-lost Uncle Franklin Shore, and tells her secrets to verify his identity. Helen is to contact Perry Mason, bring him to a hotel, and ask for Henry Leech. Helen lives with her Aunt Matilda Shore, whose husband ran off ten years earlier. But her kitten takes sick, and is rushed to the vet (a mysterious poisoning). Later she meets Perry Mason and goes to the hotel. A message redirects them to a place in the hills; when they arrive there they find a dead body in an automobile, and call the police. It is not the uncle; his death would leave a large sum to Helen. Helen returns home alone, as her aunt was taken to the hospital. When she and her boyfriend hear a noise, they investigate. Shots ring out, and her boyfriend is hit. Perry is notified. <br /> <br />When Perry and Della visit the Shore residence, Perry is taken inside where the police ask him to produce the long missing Franklin B. Shore. Della finds Tom Lunk, the gardener, and drives away with him. Lunk tells Perry that Franklin visited his home earlier to spend the night. But they find Franklin has disappeared again. Perry wants Lunk to hide in a hotel, and Della takes him there. But the police find out, and arrest Della for hiding Franklin! Della escapes conviction for hiding Franklin, a material witness, because of the actions of the kitten at Lunk's shack! Lunk can't appear again as a witness because he is killed in a hit-and-run accident. But this results in solving the three murders. The clue again is eye-witness testimony that can't be corroborated. This story shows the variety of events and surprises that will mark future novels. <br /> <br />There is one warning in Chapter 20. Prosecutors have campaigned to sweep away constitutional guarantees, supposedly to fight professional criminals. But the end result was to stack the cards against ordinary citizens because the whole legal procedure has been completely undermined. Can you trust government to see that no known innocent person is ever prosecuted? The prosecution of Della Street provides an answer. Della will be found guilty unless she can prove her innocence!

464974:US	38002140	R2SZ7X24KI7G5	B0006D0CRW	907317695	Fleecing the lambs	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Inside The Exchange	Christopher Elias graduated from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. As editor of the magazine of the New York Stock Exchange he observed the manipulations of this private corporation in plotting and conspiring to violate the Exchange's rules and national laws in order to grab more wealth and maintain control over the financial world. Elias was fired when they found out he was writing this very readable book. This is a shocking report on the many firms of Wall Street, and will alert the public to the frauds that victimize them. Is the NYSE the most powerful and dangerous organization in the United States? You should read this book before buying stock. <br /> <br />Wall Street is full of arrogant people who regard the average investor as a \\"sucker\\" to be swindled or defrauded by selling them stock that the rich and powerful don't want (p.ix). Their main rule is \\"never give a sucker an even break\\" (p.x). The power of the Exchange is shown by the fear of those who work there (p.xi). This power prevents criticism and honest reform. Millions of Americans own shares indirectly through pension plans. Most Wall Street firms are partnerships or privately held corporations and have no public accounting (p.5). They are greedy, incompetent, shortsighted, and even dishonest. Page 8 notes the mismanagement of the later 1960s, and their pay-offs to Nixon (p.9); page 10 tells of their crookedness. Wall Street's biggest fear is not regulation, but competition from institutional investors (p.11). Are large institutions given inside information before individual investors (p.14)? Is the average investor gullible and greedy because of an urge to get rich quick? Does Wall Street \\"create wealth\\" by taking from the poor to give to the rich? <br /> <br />Chapter 3 provides a short history of Wall Street, and why \\"It Was Always That Way\\". It explains the origins of the short sale, the corner, watering stock (pp.32-34). Between 1919 to 1933 the public bought $25 billion inworthless stocks (p.35)! Page 38 tells of another bank swindle. The Exchange enabled swindlers by listing stocks to make them appear legitimate (p.46). The battle against Federal regulation in the 1930s collapsed when the President of the Exchange was caught stealing (p.43)! Chapter 4 tells of the mismanagement and back office losses in the late 1960s. The average investor should stay out of the market and buy shares in an investment plan (p.77). In 1963 the SEC concluded that Wall Street's research was merely a selling tool (p.78). Page 82 explains how selling new issues results in lucrative profits for insiders and underwriters (p.88). The market price of a stock does not represent its value (p.92). <br /> <br />The collapse of the back offices in 1968 shows why Wall Street can't regulate itself. Greed, mismanagement, or other errors were to blame (p.96). There were many problems (pp.98-99). Thefts added to the disorder (p.103). Proficient and honest management are needed for a well-run system (p.104). The author advises people to hold on to their stock certificates (p.105); a receipt is not a tangible asset. Chapter 8 discusses the loose ethics and dishonesty among salesmen (p.107). They sold stock not suited to the investors' needs; they churned accounts, and made unauthorized trades (p.108). Complaints by customers are called \\"idiot mail\\" (p.112). This book was written before the devaluation of the dollar in 1971, so dollar figures are outdated. The first half was more interesting. <br />	2004-11-06

You will be educated in reading this book, but do not assume these stories to be complete and accurate. They are the equivalent of a TV show, meant to be entertaining. <br /> <br />The Boorn Case gets a fuller discussion in Edmund Pearson's \\"Studies in Murder\\", who does not discuss the story of a \\"conspiracy\\". It defies common sense for a poor farmer in Vermont to have access to a man in New Jersey! The main point is there was no proof of any murder, or that the bones belonged to Russell Colvin. The hanging of a Harvard Professor was based solely on circumstantial evidence, a first in America. The Judge's instructions were in favor of the prosecution (pp.105-6). His story about Lizzie Borden is in error. Edmund Pearson's book was shown in error by Edward Radin's 1961 book, and his in turn. There were no bloodstains on Lizzie or Bridget, and no murder weapon found. Neither were a likely suspect, except they alone were present. David Kent's \\"Forty Whacks\\" gives a better treatment of this unsolved murder puzzle. The Judges' instructions correctly favored the defendant. Any story about the \\"Black Sox\\" and Shoeless Joe Jackson should refer to Eliot Asinof's 1963 book \\"Eight Men Out\\" which covers this story better. <br /> <br />The Alger Hiss trial divided America, \\"but not along class or party lines\\". Hiss was convicted of perjury in saying he did not recognize Whittaker Chambers. But a picture taken around 1935 shows Chambers (under his false name) to be around 145 pounds, sandy haired, and with a mustache. Compared to the 1948 Chambers, 300 lbs gray and bald, they do look like two different men. See for yourself. Chambers claimed these papers were a \\"life preserver\\", but were worth little without his corroboration. And Hiss, unlike real Soviet spies, never left America after his release. There are problems with the evidence (p.316). <br /> <br/>The book \\"Tainting Evidence\\" has a chapter on the evidentiary problems in the Jeffrey MacDonald case. This is mentioned on pages 435-6. There is no evidence of any payoff to get MacDonald convicted. One of the most publicized and yet unknown case is the OJ Trial. The limousine driver picked him up at 11pm and drove him to the airport. OJ could not have personally murdered his ex-wife and the visiting waiter. The Medical Examiner who did the autopsies testified that the forensic evidence said they were murdered after 11pm. [The red, liquid blood suggests murder after 11:30pm, just before the bodies were found.] These facts trump manufactured evidence like the planted glove and fabricated blood evidence. In June 1996 the Los Angeles Times reported that the lead detective took away blood samples of the victims before the evidence was turned in for DNA testing. O.J. Simpson escaped the fate of Dr. Sam Shepard (or Tom Mooney). Isn't it true that murders by organized crime are rarely solved by the police? <br />	2004-11-05

Her competitor, Harry Peavis, bought up a few shares in her small corporation. Now he wants to buy up control. Mildreth calls Perry Mason's office for an appointment, then visits her invalid sister Carlotta and her husband Bob. Chapter 2 explains how this nightclub with a PRIVATE door runs a racket. The witness, Esther Dilmeyer, is poisoned by candy but is found in time. Mildreth suspects Bob has given up Carlotta's shares in the corporation. There is another roller-coaster ride of a story where events pop-up as a surprise twist. Complications arise from page to page, chapter to chapter, yet the storyline stays simple to follow.    In Chapter 5 Mason visits the nightclub owner's cabin, only to find the police and newspaper reporters covering his murder. Lynk was dead quite a while (the coagulation of blood and rigor mortis). Now the question is who did it from the list of suspects, or an as yet unknown person. Chapter 6 tells how a suspect could refuse to answer questions based on constitutional rights. Lieutenant Tragg plays with Mildreth like a cat with a mouse, and gets her admission (Mason represents her sister Carlotta). Mason points out that husbands and wives are more likely to kill each other than a stranger (Chapter 9). Chapter 13 explains why a claimant in a court of equity must have clean hands; illegal means, entrapment, fraud, or oppression disqualify a suit. Mason learns of facts that lead to the questioning of a witness, and the truth comes out to free his client. Mildreth recovers the missing stock and keeps her business. This all takes place in two fast-paced days. One item dates this novel: a woman wearing \\"light woolen stockings\\" (Chapter 3).	2004-10-27

She is picked up by a wealthy man, who drinks and drives fast. There is an accident; people are injured and one dies. But Stephane is found alone in the car, and charged with manslaughter. A friend obtains Perry Mason's help. The owner of this car says it was stolen, and has an alibi. But did he load this car to a friend? His insurance covers a stolen car, but not one driven by him, or an agent. The investigation of the owner reveals some curious facts, derived from telephone bills (long distance). This leads to a Mrs. Warfield in New Orleans. A promise of a job brings her to Los Angeles (Chapter VII). This chapter gives an example of proper behavior in a job interview, even one designed to investigate the applicant. Mason puts detectives to work on the witnesses. But Mrs. Warfield outsmarts Mason and Drake (Chapter X)! They find the missing driver, but he won't testify in court to clear Stephane.     Information is found that would clear Stephane. But the chauffeur becomes unavailable to testify, like the missing driver. The police and district attorney are wary of Hollywood influence (Chapter XIX). An interview in the hotel room with the widow points to the likely suspect, and confirms Mason's suspicions. Mrs. Warfield is found in hiding, and the story ends.     The ending seems logically flawed to me. Its as if Gardner was afraid to offend Hollywood and the powers behind them. One interesting scene is where a person leaves their hotel room and doesn't lock the door; what a sense of security in those days.	2004-10-27

They do not teach 'official history', so expect to have your assumptions challenged by fresh points of view. Good history should be enjoyed like good literature. The two dozen articles can't be easily summarized. <br /> <br />David Hapgood's article on Henry George explains the origin of the \\"Single Tax\\", and how this theory evolved from observed facts. Richard Hofstadter's essay seems like advocacy, not history, and is not as good as the surrounding articles. Thurman Arnold's article on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act points out the twin evils of concentrated economic power: high prices due to a lack of competition, and the destruction of local businesses and draining away of local capital. John Garraty reconsiders William Jennings Bryan as a progressive Democrat and a Fundamentalist Christian. John Scott's article on Jane Addams tells how a charity can gain popular support, and then use this for political purposes. Robert Gallagher's interview with Alice Paul explains the need for a federal amendment rather than using state referenda. William Leuchtenburg doesn't tell what bankers, merchants, and manufacturers wanted with the Spanish colonies in the Pacific. Corporate controlled newspapers  created \\"American gullibility about foreign affairs\\" (p.209). Harold Larrabee tells of the American opposition to imperialism (p.219). <br /> <br />Thomas Bailey lists Woodrow Wilson's skill as a rhetorician (\\"the war to end wars\\"). His \\"Fourteen Points\\" was a masterpiece of propaganda. Colonel T. N. Dupuy says \\"the U.S. government, its senior leaders, and its commanders in Hawaii had had sufficient information to be adequately warned that an attack was possible, and had had time to be prepared to thwart or to blunt the blow\\" (p.235). Charles Mee Jr. provides a nicely balanced interpretation of the Cold War. This continued WWII prosperity built upon deficit spending.Page 269 explains why the use of atomic bombs was not necessary. John K. Galbraith analyzes the causes of the Great Depression after the prosperity of the 1920s. One cause was the bubble in corporate investments, a pyramid of holding companies. The stock market boomed as securities would greatly increase in value even if they never paid a dividend! David Rothman explains how low wages and periodic unemployment created poverty among wage-earners. David Bennett tells of the Townsend Plan and its flawed \\"value added\\" sales tax that would have hurt workers. Allan Nevins considers FDR's place in history. His greatness was a product of his situation (p.317); FDR used other men's thoughts (p.318). <br /> <br />Richard Wade analyzes \\"The American City\\", and the progress from 1900 to 1970 (p.331). Corruption in the cities reflected a diverse and non-egalitarian society, different from small towns. Suburbs grew from railroads and then automobiles; but they are no more self-sufficient than the cities (p.339). Larry King writes about LBJ and the failure of Vietnam. Was LBJ in control or being controlled (pp.353-5)? John Brooks tries to describe the broad trends of American society and the change in traditional attitudes and values. He makes many assumptions (pp.376-7). Ray Billington's essay indulges in question-begging. His anecdotes are interesting, but lack facts. The 'Epilogue' by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. reminds us of the pessimism of the Founding Fathers (p.392). They feared that the Republic would end a failure due to \\"commerce, luxury, and avarice\\". The quote from Woodrow Wilson is funny (p.397). JFK said \\"there cannot be an American solution to every world problem\\" (p.399) <br /> <br />	2004-10-23

Curphey, M.D., Coroner of Los Angeles County, who is trying to get legal medicine used properly. If autopsies do not use current scientific methods then crimes can escape detection, or innocent persons can be convicted of crimes they did not commit. Dr. Curphey formed the Institute of Legal Medicine to combin the medical schools, the law schools, and the police and sheriff's departments in a practical partnership.    This story is about Mildred Crest, whose world collapses when her boyfriend breaks their engagement, and confesses to embezzlement from the company they work for. Mildred goes for a ride, and picks up a hitchhiker. The car crashes and burns, but Mildred decides to assume the hitchhiker's identity - Fern Driscoll. She finds a new job and apartment, and lives a more reclusive life. But an insurance investigator shows up, and asks \\"Fern Driscoll\\" to write a statement about the accident. Mildred went from the frying pan into the fire! So now she consults with Perry Mason about a \\"personal matter\\". \\"Fern\\" tells about the crash from her point of view (Chapter Three); but Mason knows she didn't tell the whole truth. A stranger shows up, tells \\"Fern\\" a story, and Mildred confesses she isn't Fern! And this is just the beginning of this story. Then the insurance investigator is stabbed, and the police investigate this murder.    Circumstantial evidence is the best evidence, unless it is misinterpreted. Eyewitness evidence can be deadly and dangerous because there is often no corroboration for this testimony (Chapter Twelve). Whenever a person was unjustly convicted, it is usually on eyewitness evidence. Most people cannot recognize a stranger seen for a few seconds (Chapter Thirteen). Would a prosecution witness who testified falsely be liable for perjury (Chapter Fifteen)? [NO!] Chapter Seventeen has the last day of the preliminary hearing. Mason's cross-examinationbrings out the hidden facts that will clear his client. It wasn't just the ice picks that were duplicated! There is another shocking surprise, and a happy ending. Mildred Crest has all charges dismissed, current and potential. [Does part of this story remind you of \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\"?]	2004-10-16

Sheppard wrote the \\"Peace Officer's Handbook\\" which serves as a guide for the constable and sheriffs of Texas. Sheppard took on the \\"Duke of Duval\\" to end that reign of fear and corruption.<br /><br />Perry and Della are working on an important brief, and need a typist. They call an agency, who promise to send out a skilled typist. Later a woman walks in and is given the work; she is quick and efficient, then takes a break. She never returns. Then they are told of a burglary in the building; the suspect resembles the unknown typist. A partner from the burglarized firm hires Perry to defend the co-owner against a murder charge. Perry tries to find this typist by using a scheme that recalls A.C. Doyle's \\"The Red-Headed League\\". Perry also assigns detectives to follow this partner as he suspects he's hiding something. The accused co-owner also refuses to discuss certain things. Perry visits the partner's woman friend, only to later find she skipped town. Could the alleged murder victim (no body found) have absconded with the smuggled diamonds?<br /><br />Like the stories of Dashiell Hammett, this tells of the techniques used to follow a person, and how to avoid a tail. The jury returns a guilty verdict against Perry's client, no recommendation of mercy. But Paul Drake's investigators uncover the facts implied by the testimony of the witnesses. So who was the other man in the boat? This plot seems flawed in having one of the smugglers going to the police to file a murder charge.	2004-10-16

They have investigated cases where innocent persons have been wrongly convicted. His \\"Perry Mason Room\\" is dedicated to the ideals of unswerving loyalty to a client, a devotion to the cause of justice, and an indomitable fighting spirit.    This story begins in a company parking lot. Arlene Ferris can't start her car that evening, but a stranger happens by and offers her a ride. He is the son of the company's owner. Then Loring Lamont makes a detour to their country home to drop off some papers. This turned out to be a trick on Arlene, she escaped Loring's advances, and the next day consulted Perry Mason. But they find out that Loring was murdered that night, and the police know Loring was with a young woman. Mason advises his client to visit her friend, and begins working on this case. The police find Arlene and charge her with the murder.    Chapter Five tells of the problem with personal identification. If a victim looks over mug shots, and later sees that person in a police lineup, the victim will likely identify a familiar face. Some people have accurate memories, other people don't. The cross-examination in Chapter Ten focuses on the identification by two eye-witnesses. As in the real world, its who you know that can help you land a job (Chapter Twelve).    Then Mason finds that Arlene's friend got a payoff to skip town, and finds a solution to Arlene's innocence that is consistent with the known facts. \\"The function of a court of law ... is to see that justice is done\\" (Chapter Fourteen). The newly discovered facts leads to the real killer, and Arlene is freed. One of the lessons of this story is why circumstantial evidence (the clothes on the victim) is most reliable.	2004-10-16

Its purpose is to educate citizens about their civic responsibilities in the field of law enforcement, and lists the topics. Public understanding and co-operation are needed for efficient law enforcement. Organized crime is becoming stronger, juvenile delinquency is on the increase. This dedication is to those citizens of Texas who worked for a new concept of law enforcement.<br /><br />Perry Mason receives a phone call from a young woman who won't give her name. She wants Perry to attend a trial and give his conclusions. The trial starts in less than an hour, but Perry agrees to go. A young man is on trial for hit and run, manslaughter. Ted Balfour's attorney shows his skill in his cross-examination of George Dempster (Chapter Two), and Myrtle Anne Haley (Chapter Three). The problem with this eyewitness testimony is given in Chapters Four and Five. Further discussions with various people bring out the hidden facts (Chapter Nine). Investigations reveal hidden evidence and relationships. Chapter Fourteen warns against gambling with strangers, and reveals another level to this puzzling case. It becomes more complicated by Chapter Fifteen, which also tells how a family-controlled business can use \\"business expenses\\" to give tax-free money to family members.<br /><br />It appears that Ted Balfour will be convicted, based on the testimony of his step-mother and his company's trouble-shooter. But Perry notices a discrepancy between the victim's driver license and his fingerprints, which leads to the surprising conclusion, and a victory for his client. [The secret is similar to the one in Graham Greene's \\"The Third Man\\".] This story will educate the reader as to cross-examination, where a witness is tested by opposing counsel.	2004-10-16

They had two novels combined in one paperback at a bargain price. Erle Stanley Gardner was \\"the World's Greatest Author\\" in his time, his novels outsold the combined totals of his rivals. Gardner wrote the \\"Perry Mason\\" novels from 1933 to 1970, and other works. Gardner, and others, formed \\"The Court of Last Resort\\" in the 1940s to investigate the wrongfully convicted. The background of the stories tell of the era. Gardner never put dates in his novels, but the monetary figures date these stories.<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Glamorous Ghost\\" (1955) begins with a young woman in a park at night, nearly nude. The police were called and find an apparent amnesia victim. Della Street shows Perry Mason this article, and tells him the half-sister wants Perry to represent Eleanor Corbin, that young woman. The half-sister warns Perry that Eleanor must be in another jam after taking off with Douglas Hepner two weeks ago. Eleanor met Douglas on a return cruise from Europe, their family is wealthy. Eleanor tells Perry that she married Douglas, they were in an automobile accident, and she remembers nothing. But Douglas has disappeared and can't be found. The investigation finds out a number of hidden facts in the background of this newly married couple. But were they in fact married? Other statements don't check out, and lead to new people who are connected to this pair. Soon a dead body shows up, and the found evidence points to Eleanor. Her story sounds incriminating, her only witness is the murder victim! Perry figures out the loose ends, and unravels the mystery to free his client. One fact leads to another until the case is closed. The innocent is cleared and the guilty are revealed in another dramatic court trial. An example where murder is used to hide other crimes. Note how Perry draws the right conclusion from the contents of the dead man's pockets.<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Half-Wakened Wife\\" (1945) begins in a bank where an agent tries to give Jane Keller $500 on a back payment for an oil lease. Widow Keller has sold the property and refuses the money. A bank officer says she needs a lawyer. We meet Jane's sister Martha, her niece, and her family history. Martha takes Jane to see Perry Mason. Perry calls Scott Shelby (who has the oil lease) and goes to meet him. No deal is made. The meeting on the yacht presents the positions on the deal, but nothing results. Perry hears a woman scream and a shot fired, then a splash in the river. They find Scott Shelby has disappeared, and Marion Shelby has a pistol with one empty shell in it. No body was found, they send for the Sheriff. Sergeant Dorset arrests Marion Shelby for murder, Perry instructs his client how to answer questions. Perry visits Paul Drake to discuss the facts and a possible explanation. Drake calls his men to investigate the disappearance of Scott Shelby. Drake's operatives watch the apartment of Ellen Cushing, half-owner of that oil lease. Perry meets Ellen at her apartment, and at her garage. Lieutenant Tragg was there. Perry and Della check on Ellen's story. Finally, Shelby's body is found. Dr. Horace Sterling testifies that Shelby received a blow on the head around the time of death. There were no powder burns on the victim. The bullet was in unusually good condition, did not penetrate deep, and started to wobble. Perry shows bias from this witness. Ellen testifies about her deal with Shelby. Later Marion Shelby calls Perry to fire him as her counsel. Her brother-in-law Lawton Keller advised her to use a lawyer from the firm representing Ellen! During the deposition of Ellen Perry asks questions that sheds new light on the unknown facts. The newspapers report the solution to the murder. Marion is freed by her ex-lawyer.	2004-10-16

They take place in 1950s Los Angeles California where Erle Stanley Gardner lived and worked. Gardner never put dates in his novels to keep them from being dated. But after the devaluation of the dollar from 1971 on many of the dollar figures are long out of date. There were other changes in law and culture as well. Gardner was a trial attorney himself, his experiences were not unlike that of Perry Mason. His novels economize on characterization by using dialogue to keep the story moving. Few of the people tell the whole truth to Mason. His job is to compare testimony to the facts gathered by his private investigator. Mason’s clients are usually “middle class” or better; few clients have messy lives or cases. The stories involve some technical or scientific facts, and show some point of law.    Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the “Court of Last Resort” which sought to free unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone. Mason’s clients are always not guilty, because few would buy a book where a defense lawyer let the guilty go free. An important lesson for the reader is to think about the facts, and not jump to a conclusion based on newspaper reports. These seven novels are often educational (like some novels of Dashiell Hammett) in teaching about the tricks of undercover detectives. You’ll learn about a “roper”, rough or smooth shadows, etc. and be able to identify the undercover operatives that you may encounter in your life.   Gardner’s stories warned of the dangers of invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. Some stories made the point that while ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (before or after the crime). “Perry Mason” advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer. There is a famous true crime that has the above elements. Sacco & Vanzetti were convicted of robbery and murder in spite of their alibis and the lack of guilty evidence. Most believe they were innocent and were convicted as part of the political repression of the 1920s   “The Case of the Glamorous Ghost”. A young woman was found in a park at night, nearly nude. She seems to be an amnesia victim. When her missing boyfriend is found dead she is accused of the murder. “The Case of the Terrified Typist”. A skilled typist shows up for work, then disappears. This typist matches a suspect in a burglary. Perry Mason’s client is convicted of murder, but this is overturned on a technicality. “The Case of the Lucky Loser”. A young man is on trial for a hit-and-run. The investigation brings out hidden facts. Why did his step-mother and a company official testify against him? “The Case of the Screaming Woman”. A wife calls to have her husband’s story checked. He had picked up a hitchhiker and taken her to a motel. After a nearby doctor was killed, the man is charged with murder. “The Case of the Long-Legged Models”. A young lady inherited shares in a Las Vegas casino. A man is pressuring her to sell out. When the man is murdered, the young lady is charged with murder. “The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll”. A woman runs away and assumes a new identity. But an investigator ties the new identity to a past crime. When the investigator is killed, she is accused of the murder. “The Case of the Waylaid Wolf”. A woman can’t start her car, and is given a ride by her employer’s son. She resists his advances, then runs off. When this man is found dead she is charged with murder.	2004-10-10

Books	5	10	10	N	N	The Importance of the Common Law System	This book tells about the murder of Sir Harry Oakes, identifies the murderers, and explains the involvement of others in this officially unsolved murder. The evidence against the accused son-in-law was forged and fabricated by Miami detectives brought in by the Duke of Windsor! Few were neutral about Sir Harry Oakes. To some he was a benefactor and philanthropist, to others he was a robber and cruel oppressor. Oakes made a huge fortune by discovering gold in Ontario; earlier he sought gold in the Yukon and elsewhere. He migrated to the Bahamas, which had no income tax, and spent money developing the island (p.12) <br /> <br />Chapter 2 is a short biography of the Prince of Wales. He had average abilities, and poor judgment that created his bad luck. [An argument against hereditary rule?] He threw away his throne to marry a twice-divorced adventuress. Chapter 3 gives the biography of Wallis Warfield, who learned to please other people. David and Wallis were joined in mutual hedonism (p.35). Chapter 5 tells of the history of piracy, corruption, and crookedness in the Bahamas. It was settled by Loyalists and Southerners. Their social and economic structure is parasitic. Chapter 6 tells of Sir Harry's death: struck by a winch lever that had four prongs (p/67). Sir Harry reneged on a deal with Meyer Lansky! The body was returned to his bed, and set afire as a warning to others. The solution came from an unnamed informant (p.69). Chapter 9 tells of the amazing exploits of Raymond Schindler, a famous investigator. The Bahamian police destroyed evidence (p.91). Chapter 10 explains the origins of the police under the Common Law system. Chapter 11 gives a short history of the Common Law. Cross-examination is distinctive to the Common Law system; it tests the truthfulness of the witnesses (p.127). Chapter 16 notes the medical testimony about the murder. \\"Time of death can be determined accurately only by non-medical evidence: (p.152). De Marigny was at the murder scene beforethe search for fingerprints (pp.172-3). Chapter 19 has the testimony of the fingerprint expert on Exhibit J; this cross-examination was one of the most brilliant in history (p.205). Chapter 21 tells of the problem with this sole fingerprint (p.226). Erle Stanley Gardner's comment is still true today (p.242). Chapter 26 shows the technique of attacking the defendant's character to sway the jury. Legitimate alibis often fail to convince because they involve a relative, neighbor, or friend. Experts disputed the validity of the fingerprint. A Police Captain saw Harold Christie in the passenger seat of a station wagon when he should have been in bed! The Judge summed up the case \\"against the Crown\\" (p.301). The jury quickly returned a \\"not guilty\\" verdict, and the crowds celebrated. Leonarde Keeler used his polygraph to test de Marigny and found his statements truthful. <br /> <br />Chapter 33 suggests de Marigny would have been convicted under a Civil Law system where he would have \\"to prove his innocence\\". [But this assumes he would have been indicted.] Civil Law was created by kings and emperors, not from popular customs. Precedents of prior cases have no effect; there is no habeas corpus, or rules against torture. Common Law judges have had historical independence, and balanced the interests and right of the people against their rulers. There are four basic conditions for personal rights and democratic government. Chapter 34 warns us of attacks on the Common Law system (p.318). Lawyers do not train as apprentices in law offices, law schools do not train them as advocates. Houts suggests five steps to cure this problem (pp.322-324). Trial by jury is the only truly democratic form of participation left in the justice system. Houts suggests five steps to improve the police; we can't go back to the private vigilante system of previous centuries (p.326). The police must gather all the facts in the case, and not ignore or suppress evidence. The judge, jury, and prosecutorwill do the rest. <br /> <br />	2004-10-09

The author is a peace activist turned journalist and author; he writes for newspaper and book publishers. Brenner complains about the Democratic Party because it is not what he wants it to be. Perhaps it is what other people want it to be? Brenner wants \\"liberals\\" to better understand what this party really stands for. His history shows that it has changed over the decades. This history won't be boring; it is his opinions on the past and present. Brenner imagines an ideal party, and is angry because the reality doesn't match it. Isn't the perfect the enemy of the good? <br /> <br />Brenner read James Madison's Federalist No. 10 about property relations driving politics. He also knows that mankind is disposed to suffer evils rather than to right them (Jefferson). Brenner writes well, but makes assumptions (p.45). His opinions are given rather than a complete history. Brenner views American history as \\"an expose of blatant demagoguery, of never-ending corruption and of imperialist murders, past, present and future\\"! Pages 74-75 tell what happened to those who organized the Teamsters: jailed so bureaucrats and crooks could take over! Page 63 mocks poor women who wanted perms.

Sir Harry Oakes became one of the richest men in the world by discovering gold in Ontario. He did not inherit his fortune, or make it by exploiting any person, company, or country. His gruff crude manner masked his erudition. This book lacks an index and a table of contents. Chapter 1 tells the history of Sir Harry Oakes and Alfred de Marigny to 1943. After Sir Harry Oakes' strange death, de Marigny was arrested for the murder. The prison doctor who examined de Marigny saw \\"no marks of any burns\\" (p.25), and was immediately dismissed! Barker and Melchen poisoned Lady Oakes' mind against de Marigny (p.26). Nancy remained loyal to her husband. The most damning evidence against de Marigny was his fingerprint at the murder scene (p.29). When the Commissioner of Police could testify to de Marigny's presence earlier that day, the Commissioner was transferred far away to prevent this testimony (p.29)! De Marigny's driver was beaten to try to make him testify against de Marigny! The two watchmen on duty the night of the murder disappeared (p.31). Nancy hired Raymond Schindler, the famous private detective (p.30). A very powerful person was trying to murder an innocent victim (p.32). <br /> <br />Many of the witnesses that testified were not present at the time of the murder. What some witnesses claimed to know did not match what they really knew (p.35). Harold Christie was very ill at ease in the witness box, and sweated profusely as if terrified (p.39). Captain Melchen did not know of the fingerprint until the funeral (p.51). This fingerprint was not photographed in situ, but lifted. It did not show the background, unlike the example given in court (p.66). Chapter 5 tells about the Normandie fire, and suggests this sabotage was part of a scheme. The Federal Government would ally with Organized Crime. Page 90 offers and explanation of this arson; page 91 explains the death of a witness. The story of the racket in 'Engine Parts' is on page102. Chapter 6 gives the biography of Harold Christie, a visionary businessman who was self-made. Did de Marigny remind the Duke of a former boyfriend of the Duchess (p.116)? The House of Assembly first considered how any development helped them (p.118). Captain H. Montgomery Hyde found lax security in the Bahamas (pp.130-134). The very rich could buy anything in the world, except happiness for their children (p.136). One threat of Axel Wenner-Gren was as a competitor to US investors in Mexico (p.142). Sir Harry Oakes preferred gold over paper money (p.144). Could he have been the inspiration for \\"Goldfinger\\"? <br /> <br />James Leasor used his writing skills to fill in the unknown parts of this story. It relates Sir Harry Oakes' murder to a bigger picture. De Marigny's 'not guilty' verdict was met with popular approval (p.219). The 'Epilogue' tells of subsequent events. The DEA estimates that 80% of the drugs smuggled into the US come through the Bahamas. Their profits are laundered through the many banks there. The Playboy Casino was constructed on the site of Sir Harry Oakes' house (p.246). Independence for the Bahamas was followed by a loss of safety and personal security. But don't other gambling locales also attract criminals? <br />	2004-10-03

If you read the book you can understand the film and the changes made from the book. James Bond again works as an enforcer for an Official Monopoly the Bank of England. They want to eliminate the competition in the sale of gold. Gold is \\"the most valuable and most easily marketable commodity in the world\\", and \\"gold is virtually untraceable\\". \\"Gold attracts the biggest, the most ingenious criminals.\\" You can review the history of imperialism for thousands of years, since Imperial Rome. Bond is to investigate the activities of Goldfinger, as suspect in gold smuggling. <br /> <br />The book begins by telling of as assignment in Mexico to stop the shipment of heroin to England by unofficial means. Arriving in Miami, he meets an American millionaire who wants his advice. Bond finds out why: Junius is losing thousands playing two-handed Canasta. Bond discovers the cheating method, and turns this around; this is his introduction to Goldfinger. [Fleming's detailed observations shows his skills as a former foreign reporter and intelligence agent.] Back in England Bond is assigned to investigate smuggling gold from Britain to India (reversing the effect of 19th century imperialism?). Goldfinger is the suspect; he uses a chain of shops to buy Old Gold (a euphemism for stolen goods?). The problem is to find the method used in smuggling so it can be ended. Goldfinger is also suspected of being a paymaster to Soviet spies, and thus a target for counter-espionage. Bond and Goldfinger play a game of golf. [Fleming shows his skill for details and knowledge of the game and course.] Once again Bond outwits Goldfinger by out-cheating him. <br /> <br />Bond follows Goldfinger to France, and on to Switzerland. There is a complication in \\"Miss Tilly Soames:, and they are caught spying on Goldfinger. Bond offers to work for Goldfinger to save his life and Tilly's too. To further the plot, this offer is accepted! They are flownto New York to be used in Goldfinger's next bold and illegal project, so audacious as to be unthinkable: robbing Fort Knox of its gold! The rest of the book tells how this plot is put into action, and how it fails through the heroic efforts of James Bond. The story continues with Goldfinger's escape from Fort Knox, and his later reappearance in a hijacked airplane. There is a miraculous escape. Oddjob is rejected, Goldfinger no longer needs his millions. Bond survives the crash of a Stratocruiser at sea. And so ends another fantastic story from the mind of Ian Fleming. Was this character inspired by Sir Harry Oakes? <br /> <br />To learn more about Ian Fleming you can read \\"Ian Fleming The Spy Who Came In with the Gold\\" by Henry A. Zeiger. His last chapter tries to explain the popularity of the Bond novels. Perhaps Bond is a heroic figure who can always win against adversity [like The Lone Ranger?]. Does Fleming deliberately and systematically excite and satisfy the worst instincts of his readers? Or does Fleming play to the faults of mankind, who like to read about places and activities that would be strange to their lives? John Le Carre (cover name) says that Bond is a mirror of contemporary maladjustments. Ian Fleming seems like a later version of John Buchan. Fleming's politicization of the enemy recalls the novels of E. Phillips Oppenheim. Note how often the Bond villains are parvenus fighting against the Establishment [a reflection of the sun setting on the British Empire?]. <br />	2004-10-02
503702:US	38002140	R2S0K41DFUXWSE	0700612912	338529938	The Zapruder Film: Reframing JFK's Assassination	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Evidence for Conspiracy	The author is a professor of history who taught courses on the JFK assassination for over 20 years. His close examination of the Zapruder film refutes the \\"lone gunman\\" and \\"single bullet\\" theories. The film provides a precise timeline of events and clues for the timing, number, origins, and impact of the shots. Using other key photos, the author builds a case to refute the Warren Report. More than three shots were fired from more than one location. Lee Harvey Oswald was not guilty as an assassin. The author was assisted by the voluminous archives of Harold Weisberg. David R. Wrone concludes JFK was killed by a conspiracy, but cannot identify the conspirators (p.1). But this is too little and too late, since others have written books much earlier. If their conclusions differ, that reflects their points of view, and the lack of incontrovertible proof. This cover-up implies high-level conspirators in Government and the Establishment. Wrone hopes that scholars who defend the Warren Report would reconsider; this naively assumes they are free to think for themselves. The existence of conspiracies is well known in just American history (p.2).    The Zapruder film disproves the official story of the assassination, and establishes that multiple riflemen killed JFK (pp.47-48). The explosion of JFK's head is incompatible with hardened military ammunition. One of the foremost ballistic experts disagreed with the \\"single bullet\\" theory (p.87). A powerful corporation bought this film and controlled its release to the public. Wrone tells what was wrong with a \\"Scientific test\\" that was government funded (p.103). Was there another rifleman (p.105)? Wrone criticizes David Lifton's \\"Best Evidence\\" and its altered body (pp.136-137). Since the wounds seen at Parkland hospital differed from the wounds seen at Bethesda, alteration was a likely assumption. But switching to a body double was a more practical solution. J. Edgar Hoover immediately claimed a lone assassin (p.143). Mark North's \\"Act of Treason\\" can explain why.    The Warren Commission manipulated the evidence to arrive at a predetermined solution (p.149). The murder of Oswald closed the case and kept the secrets. The corporate media bore a large responsibility for the acceptance of the Warren Report (p.150). The Bronson film does not show Oswald in the assassin's window, or anybody else (p.153). So too does the Hughes film (p.155). Chapter 11 is the most important, as it proves Oswald was innocent. The AEC confirmed Oswald did not fire a rifle or a pistol (p.172). Jim Garrison's \\"On the Trail of the Assassins\\" was the basis for Oliver Stone's dramatic film \\"JFK\\". It seems more credible than the \\"single bullet\\" theory (pp.205-210). Chapter 15 discusses the problems with CE399 (p.211). The origin of CE399 is a mystery (pp.224-227). Chapter 16 reveals the dissent over the \\"single bullet\\" theory (p.259=8), and against the propaganda campaign in the media (p.257).    Chapter 17 is a long argument to confiscate private property without payment. Wrone claims this would reinforce the \\"principles of a truly democratic society\\"! This perverted reasoning would be a violation of the Fifth Amendment. Another big mistake is the failure to list George O'Toole's \\"The Assassination Tapes\\". This 1975 book presented objective physical evidence that questioned Oswald's guilt, and may have led to the Congressional investigation that reopened the case. I dislike his haughtiness towards earlier writers who had less experience.     Why is Oswald \\"not guilty\\"? He was never convicted or even indicted! Why was he rubbed out two days later? To prevent him from proving his innocence! Lunch time is usually around noon. If Oswald went to lunch at noon and then washed down his meal with a bottle of soda from a machine when that policeman came by. Alive, he could have named the other people who were also in the lunchroom at that time (and they could have confirmed his alibi). Then the conspiracy would be obvious. Being in the second floor lunchroom solves the problem of hiding that rifle then running down four flights of stairs. Yes, this is my assumption, but it best explains the problem of Oswald's movements from the sixth to the second floor.     Another argument for Oswald's innocence is his denial of shooting the President. The killers of Presidents in the 19th century all boasted of their deed. So too those in the 20th century who attempted and failed. All used a pistol. Was Oswald lying about this? George O'Toole's book \\"The Assassination Tapes\\" explains why Oswald was telling the truth (or was crazy). The idea of a conspiracy also explains the differences in wounds seen in Parkland Hospital and those on the body in Bethesda. I think the conspirators simply sacrificed JFK's double to create a body whose wounds would fit the \\"lone gunman\\" theory. Why did the Establishment bump him off? JFK's use of drugs affected his judgment and risked a Nuclear War in October 1962. The book \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" explains JFK's health problems. Doesn't this theory best fit the known facts?	2004-10-01

[We know of the dangers from tobacco and alcohol, which have long been used by the general public for many centuries.] Marijuana smoke is more dangerous than tobacco, and as intoxicating as alcohol. But these dangers and better known. Marijuana can cause memory loss, lethargy, and actual brain damage. It causes damage to the liver, lungs, and respiratory tract. It can leave users passive, lazy, disoriented, unable to make decisions, and lacking ambition.<br /><br />The author, a parent, decided to assemble all the facts he could find from many publications. He believes marijuana is more dangerous than cigarettes or alcohol, and can cause irrevocable brain damage and adversely affect other parts of the human body. Every item of information has its source listed. There is no preaching or sales talk, just the facts from experts.

So there will always be those who benefit from tax policies, even if it is called \\"revenue neutral\\" (tax the poor more to tax the rich less). The authors list a number of policies that provide benefits for the rich; they call that \\"wealth fare\\". This book lists various policies and their costs; you'll rarely find this in your local newspaper. The authors believe its wrong for the rich to steal from the poor (p.8). Lower corporate taxes resulted in huge Federal deficits and higher taxes for the rest of us (p.10). <br /> <br />Government subsidies are fixed amounts of money listed in the budget. Tax breaks receive little scrutiny and are open-ended (p.12). \\"Military Waste and Fraud\\" wastes $172 billion a year. But this can provide benefits to the districts of powerful Congressmen, a form of transfer payments. These made the Southwest bloom and the Northeast a \\"rust belt\\". Overpriced items may be \\"Hollywood accounting\\" for cost-overruns. Reagan and Congress lowered taxes on the rich by raising Social Security taxes on earned income (p.36). Raising the taxable limit could reduce this tax for most people. Page 39 explains the scam of accelerated depreciation. The capital gains tax is a subsidy to the super-rich (p.41). Lower capital gains taxes results in lower growth in the economy (p.44). Page 46 explains how the Federal Reserve damaged and destroyed the Savings & Loan banks. They needed help from Congress for this looting (pp.47-48). Like the other scams, the average taxpayer pays for this too (p.51). <br /> <br />There are some mistakes in this book. The \\"average full-time farmer is worth $700,000\\" (p.56). That's not as much as it sounds: 200 acres at $2,000 an acre, house and barns about $150,000, supplies and tools another $150,000 (your estimates may vary). That is for a small owner-operated business. While they may quibble about subsidies, food is cheaper in America than elsewhere, and you don't find people dying from hunger as in earlier times (p.57). [Isn't it cost-effective to have people die from excess feeding in their 60s than from TB or hunger by age 30?] Their price for a barrel of oil is far out of date (p.67). Page 73 explains why the credit for foreign taxes can ship US jobs abroad. <br /> <br />The authors want to tax municipal bonds because the wealthy benefit more (p.74). The real problem is that states continually borrow more and more to create this tax-free income; that's why states now have such huge debts. Federal salaries and pensions can be reduced to save money and taxes (p.81). Page 83 explains the scam of corporate owned life insurance! The diatribe against \\"nuclear subsidies\\" sounds like it was paid by Big Oil. Nuclear power is big in France, Japan, and Saudi Arabia; why not here? The minerals and oil depletion allowances are tax breaks disallowed to wage earners. Page 102 makes the mistake of claiming that tax breaks keep gasoline prices lower; actually the higher prices in Europe are due to higher taxes! <br /> <br />The authors document many types of government subsidies. But don't the same laws exist in many other countries? Various groups collude to create laws that benefit them or their businesses. It just depends on whether you want the greatest good for the greatest number. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-24

It combines an analytic narrative of economic growth with an evaluation of economic welfare. It covers subjects often omitted, such as the distribution of wealth and income. It treats the main phases, trends, and turning points. The first four chapters cover 1492 to 1790, from Colonialism to national independence. The next six chapters cover 1790 to 1860: the agricultural era and emerging industrialism. The next six chapters cover 1860 to 1914: the transformation of the American economy. The last six chapters cover 1914 to 1979: the super-industrial economy.  <br /> <br />The English colonies attracted people who wanted to acquire material goods, a \\"selective migration\\". [Was this different from the Spanish colonies?] Colonies produced staples for export, and imported manufactured goods. The enclosure movements in England confiscated common property to benefit the aristocracy (p.30). Forcing people off the land created immigrants for the colonies. Religious minorities also sought a refuge in America. <br /> <br />The Continental Congress created paper currency to pay for the war; this inevitably created severe inflation and dramatic price rises. Revaluing the currency downwards didn't work. Robert Morris was put in control of finances, but failed to secure taxing power for the national government. Instead of higher taxes, higher inflation paid for the war. America's productive strength overcame the monetary problems (p.87). Some merchants gained wealth from war supplies and its commerce. American continued to trade with Great Britain, but also increased or opened other markets in Europe. The post-war depression resulted in forming a strong national government to eliminate the conflicts and problems from separate but equal states (p.96). The power to tax is the basis for any government (p.97). <br />  <br />America increased in size and population from 1790 to 1860 (p.103). Immigrants, human capital, created a fast-growing labor force. Chapter 5 tells of improvements in transportation: canals, steamboats, and railroads. [No mention here of their spread of cholera.] The lands west of the Appalachians were more productive than the older lands. Improvements in transportation changed agriculture from subsistence to market production. Gains in efficiency resulted from new inventions, and more workers outside of agriculture. The primary source of Federal revenue was the tariff on imports. This protectionism paid for the national debt, and increased the rate of capital formation (p.176). <br /> <br />Industrialized production reduced the real cost of producing goods so the rising level of material welfare exceeded previous levels. Imported technology often had to be modified for local conditions. Cotton cloth manufacturing was the first modern industry (p.188). Page 195 explains the importance of interchangeable parts, as pioneered by Eli Whitney. America became a leader in this area, and in assembly line methods (p.196). Tariffs protected infant industries by redistributing income from consumers to producers. [This isn't just done by taxes.] If you have never read a book on this topic, you will be educated by this one. It compliments the usual Presidents and Wars schoolbooks. Chapter 22 is the most important (pp. 525-530). Pages 501-7 discuss the Federal Reserve, and its effects. <br />	2004-09-22
517942:US	38002140	R26O181YEPI4FF	B00005X65Z	919619860	Where death delights; the story of Dr. Milton Helpern and forensic medicine	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Crimes Seen by a Forensic Pathologist	This very readable book contains stories about forensic medicine, medical knowledge used in courtrooms and the justice system. Its purpose is to apply scientific knowledge instead of hunches or prejudice. The first and longest chapter concerns the findings of the Warren Commission. Dr. Milton Helpern criticized using inexperienced forensic pathologists to perform the autopsy. [Was that done so important facts would be missed?] The \\"single bullet theory\\" is physically impossible (pp.62-63). Dr. Helpern said JFK was hit by two separate bullets, and a third hit Gov. John Connally. The Zapruder film was not a precise timetable, but is a subjective evaluation due to unknown reaction time (pp.67-71). [But it does say that it all happened in about six seconds.] After Dr. Helpern spoke out on this topic, he was blacklisted from Government lists of pathologists!<br /><br />Chapter 2 explains what a forensic pathologist does, and provides an actual case as an example. The love of money is still the root of all evils. Clinical death occurs when there are no signs of life. Before medical death occurs, a person can be resuscitated (p.93). Expert witnesses will testify to favor the side that hired them. Chapter 3 tells why medical science cannot give the precise answers asked of it. A good pathologist won't say anything in the courtroom that he wouldn't say in the classroom. While the cause of death is always a medical question, the manner of death is usually not a purely medical determination (p.135). Every human body is different; you can't judge by tables from an insurance company. Chapter 5 tells of one romance gone awry in Manhattan. Do all humans have a compulsion to confess wrongdoing?<br /><br />Chapter 6 explains why cosmetic surgery can't cure personal problems! Chapter 7 tells where a death after a struggle could be from \\"natural causes\\" rather than a homicide. But an acquittal often carries the stigma of suspicions of guilt (p.194). Chapter 8 has many \\"Incredible Coincidences\\" encountered by Dr. Helpern. Some common misconceptions are corrected. Chapter 9 tells of a misplaced newborn in a Swiss hospital. Blood typing can identify an individual, or rule out a suspect. Dr. Helpern believes there will be revolutionary developments in the future for crime detection (p.227). Chapter 10 explains the \\"thanatognomic sign\\" (p.235). Dr. Helpern rejects the idea of a common grave of multiple victims, like an air disaster (Chapter 11). Diseases can uniquely mark a person (p.249).<br /><br />Chapter 12 provides an example why an autopsy should be done in every homicide case, even the obvious ones (p.261). Chapter 13 explains why \\"brutal, multiple wound cases\\" denote a homosexual murder. Another carefully devised plan failed due to human error (p.269). Embalming a body before an autopsy can destroy or eliminate important evidence. Our affluent society creates stresses and pressures on people (p.281). Chapter 15 explains why some places aren't interested in good autopsies: they primarily benefit insurance companies! It tells of another unusual death (p.289). Chapter 16 observes that weather has a noticeable effect: extremely hot weather results in deaths for the elderly, and may cause more violent deaths (p.291). Each human in an individual, and so is their death.<br /><br />The Appendix contains questions referred to Dr. Helpern; no answers are given. A missionary asked if reading the stories of Erle Stanley Gardner would help in a course in forensic medicine. The `Foreword' in \\"The Case of the Worried Waitress\\" will tell you about Marshall Houts' experiences. \\"The Case of the Shapely Shadow\\" is dedicated to him. Marshall Houts was a member of Erle Stanley Gardner's \\"Court of Last Resort\\" in the 1950s-1960s, and wrote many books on law. The 1967 book \\"The Case of the Queenly Contestant\\" said 'a bullet found on a stretcher is only proof that it was planted there'.	2004-09-18

The next morning July 8 , 1943 Sir Harry Oakes, one of the richest men in the British Empire, was found murdered in bed. This made page one news around the world. Oakes was a crude, tough man who became fabulously rich by finding a rich gold mine in Ontario (p.5). He was rich enough to buy a title from the British Crown (p.6), and still had the rude manners of the rough and tumble mining camps. Oakes had business problems and planned to move to Mexico. Bahamas had low taxes, and a bank that laundered money (p.8).    Harold Christie spent that night sleeping in the next bedroom. He heard no sounds of a struggle, nor the smell of smoke from the fire. The Governor of the island summoned two Miami police detectives to investigate (p.19). The crime scene had not been secured. Later all handprints and fingerprints were removed (p.22)! Alfred de Marigny, the son-in-law of Oakes, was arrested for the murder. The Duke of Windsor personally took charge of the police investigation (politics?). De Marigny had disrespected the Duke. But it came as a shock to be arrested for Harry Oakes murder.    \\"Trials are not really about truth or justice. They are about winning ...\\" (p.69). The accused in Britain is worse off than in America (p.65). De Marigny's wife hired the famous New York detective Raymond Schindler. Page 79 hints of the trouble that can arise from drinking a glass of water while in police custody. The two caretakers who saw a mysterious cabin cruiser the night of the murder were suddenly found dead (p.81)! Page 86 tells how fingerprints can be forged. The four small holes in Oakes' mastoiditis could only have been from a small-caliber pistol (p.92).     \\"Part Three\\" is his condensed autobiography. The older economy of the Bahamas is described (pp.145-146). De Marigny's sailing was an escape from worldly cares (p.156). The King's Cup Regatta is explained (p.162). Godfrey Higgs' cross-examination of James Barker was \\"one of the most brilliant\\"; it cast doubt on the fingerprint evidence (p.219). After being found 'not guilty', de Marigny passed a polygraph test (p.234). Alfred was termed \\"undesirable\\" because he sailed on Sundays instead of praying in church (pp.237-239). Alfred agreed to write an autobiography for Random House; then somebody shot at him so he canceled the book (pp.253-254). Alfred tells of meeting Mrs. Betsy Bloomingdale (pp.262-263). On a trip to Grand Bahamas Alfred finally learned what happened to the two night watchmen that night (pp.289-290). Did Sir Harry Oakes lend money to someone who couldn't repay? Remember the Harvard College murder circa 1850?    The Epilogue gives Alfred's solution to the murder. You need to read the book for its background knowledge. Alfred mentioned the reasons for the Duke's dislike of him; the event of the Exchange Control Board suggests some hidden rivalry (pp.169-170). Alfred's recollections appear to be carefully edited. Do some of Alfred's claims seem to be self-serving statements? [Charles Higham's \\"The Duchess of Windsor\\" has a short chapter on the \\"Crime of the Century\\".] You should read Marshall Houts' book on this case for a more objective treatment.	2004-08-28

She was exceptionally pretty, shrewd, and had native intelligence. Her charms attracted rich and powerful men who catered to her desires. Yet she became another victim trapped by greed and exploitation. Beauty does not trump class distinctions (p.7). Vicki lived fast and died young. The author compares her to Dorothy Stratten, Colleen Applegate, and Edie Sedgewick. Vicki got close enough to corporate rulers and political leaders. Did she know too much and become a threat to the established order (p.8)? Did Vicki's absent father affect her interest in older men? This book lacks a table of contents and an index. <br /> <br />After Vicki sued Alfred Bloomingdale, the tawdry sex life of this intimate adviser to Ronald Reagan was exposed. The author was introduced to Vicki by a movie producer, and began talks to produce a book. Vicki met Alfred Bloomingdale at 17 and became his kept mistress; she then learned the manners and morals of the upper class. Alfred Bloomingdale was a member of Ronald Reagan's kitchen cabinet. He was a co-founder of Diner's Club; personal information about the lives of the rich and famous were useful to intelligence services (p.41). Alfred Bloomingdale could have been a perfect case study for psychiatrists (pp.66-67). Alfred had the money and power to indulge his whims (p.60). Vicki stayed with him because she needed money to raise her son (p.63). But her spending habits suggest she considered it something to get rid of as fast as she got it (pp.81-82). <br /> <br />Vicki tried living with other men, but always came back to Alfred Bloomingdale. After he died, Vicki was left with nothing but shame and despair (p.87). When Betsy saw Alfred and Vicki together, she ended the affair (pp.110-103). Alfred gave Vicki a settlement. The rest of the book tells of Vicki's continued used of drugs and the ensuing decadence. The last 100 pages are a sort of low-key horror story that lead to Vicki's death. President Reagan appointed Alfred Bloomingdale to the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board; what kind of pay-off was this? Vicki's suit against Betsy created a scandal, and her friends departed. Needing money, Vicki took in Marvin Pancoast to pay expenses. But she had been warned against him! One night Marvin turned on Vicki and killed her. This book could serve as a warning to teenagers, but those who could benefit probably won't read it. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-26

It explains the reason for federal income, inheritance, estate, gift, and excess-profits taxes, and the protective tariff. Each period of history has its stages of economic development and its social and economic interests. Tax laws reflect the values and policy for certain goals, and who will pay the costs to attain these goals. The conflicts between the oligarchies and the rising middle class were fueled by taxation. Taxation has always been a source of conflicts between different classes and sections. Taxation can concentrate wealth and income for one class or section, or it can be used against concentrated economic power; it is not just about revenue. The merit of a tax program is measured by its human consequences. Taxes affect employment, the distribution of economic resources, and the supply of factors used in production. The test of taxation in our democracy is whether it advances or retards economic equality. Economic equality is best advanced by income, gift, estate, inheritance, and excess-profits taxes; it is retarded by tariffs and sales taxes. Class politics is the essence of taxation. Taxes carry emotional burdens for the payers when they do not approve of government programs. But in a socially progressive state the benefits equal or exceed the costs of taxes. In a regressive state taxes are used to take wealth from the masses to benefit the privileged ruling groups. Just as the thermometer measures temperature, taxation measures the power relationship between the masses and the classes. <br /> <br />The acceptance or rejection of any type of taxation depends on two basic factors: actual economic conditions and financial needs of the government, and the opinions and social values that determine the acceptable ends and the means. Income taxes can be traced back to early colonial America, the faculty tax of 1643. Colonies passes faculty taxes to pay for the War of Independence. This tax fell into disuse in the 19th century; tax was assessed on the selling value of land. Various state governments used an income tax in the 1840s. Large landowners favored the income tax on merchants and professionals to keep land taxes low. The Civil War produced the federal income and inheritance taxes. The tax on income was universally classified as an indirect tax; this tax was progressive from the start as a pragmatic choice. The inheritance tax was also graduated. Then the protective tariff was raised. Funds were raised by loans. Higher rates on higher incomes was a luxury tax. The progressive income tax is the only tax which could not be shifted to the consumer. <br /> <br />After the Civil War ended, merchants and importers wanted the federal income tax retained and the protective tariff abolished. Bankers and manufacturers wanted the income tax abolished and a high protective tariff. Senator John Sherman said the income tax \\"was the most just and equitable tax\\" and \\"the only discrimination in our tax laws that will reach wealthy men as against the poorer classes\\". The struggle against this \\"most just and equitable tax\\" goes on today. Do you know who is winning? <br />	2004-08-24

But many suspected this was a murder. Some of the suspects were: her business associate; her cafe treasurer; a gangster involved with gambling, drugs, and prostitution; and her former husband (p.8). The author became interested in this case, spent seven years researching old records, interviewing men who had inside knowledge of the underworld, and the personal letters of Thelma Todd. These were used to recreate the true story of this murder. Not all sources could be named (p.11). [This book provides a background to Raymond Chandler's stories.] <br /> <br />Chapter One tells about finding her body, and the puzzling facts surrounding this death. Why would a popular and successful comedienne commit suicide? Hollywood considered itself above the law and had the cash to fix any problem. Thelma's body showed lacerations and contusions around her neck, cracked ribs, a broken nose, and a chipped front tooth. Partially digested food was found in her stomach, which contradicted the official explanation of the Medical Examiner (p.28). The Grand Jury heard numerous witnesses whose testimony held up under scrutiny (p.30). The testimony led to a story of mob involvement (p.47). But DA Buron Fitts wanted to squelch this (p.48). Pages 54-57 tell of Thelma's father, and the influences on her life. Thelma's mother dominated her, and pushed her to Hollywood (p.59). The author tells of Thelma's personality as a sexy virgin (pp.60-61). Thelma was named Miss Massachusetts of 1925 (p.66). A talent scout from a movie studio saw her, and signed her. The \\"good girl\\" from Lawrence became the sensuous, sexy, sultry blonde (p.68). Pages 76-77 explain how \\"public relations\\" worked in Lawrence [and elsewhere]. <br /> <br />Chapter Six describes Hollywood in the 1920s; a boom town with a seamy reputation for sex and drugs (pp.82-84). Los Angeles was \\"wide open\\" and operated for the politically powerful rich. Hollywood boomed during the Great Depression (p.93). Prohibition empowered gangsters (p.97). Drug dealing brought organized crime to Hollywood (p.115). [This book teaches the history censored from the schoolbooks!] Thelma became dependent on diet pills (p.124). Her \\"sweet, bubbly personality\\" made her popular (p.126). Page 139 tells how business competition in restaurants worked. Thelma's career reached new heights when teamed with ZaSu Pitts. But Thelma seemed to have no real male friends (p.221). Thelma took tranquilizers to sleep, and amphetamines for energy (p.224). <br /> <br />There are many people in show business who are found dead after taking pills and drinking alcohol. Victims of gangsters are often shot or knifed, violent bloody deaths. Andy Edmonds builds a case to place Thelma's death as a gangland slaying. The author explains why Roland West's deathbed confession was false (p.279). District Attorney Buron Fitts was rumored to be corrupt and inept (p.281).

The \\"good girl\\" from Lawrence became the sensuous, sexy, sultry blonde (p.68). Pages 76-77 explain how \\"public relations\\" worked in Lawrence [and elsewhere].     Chapter Six describes Hollywood in the 1920s; a boom town with a seamy reputation for sex and drugs (pp.82-84). Los Angeles was \\"wide open\\" and operated for the politically powerful rich. Hollywood boomed during the Great Depression (p.93). Prohibition empowered gangsters (p.97). Drug dealing brought organized crime to Hollywood (p.115). [This book teaches the history censored from the schoolbooks!] Thelma became dependent on diet pills (p.124). Her \\"sweet, bubbly personality\\" made her popular (p.126). Page 139 tells how business competition in restaurants worked. Thelma's career reached new heights when teamed with ZaSu Pitts. But Thelma seemed to have no real male friends (p.221). Thelma took tranquilizers to sleep, and amphetamines for energy (p.224).     There are many people in show business who are found dead after taking pills and drinking alcohol. Victims of gangsters are often shot or knifed, violent bloody deaths. Andy Edmonds builds a case to place Thelma's death as a gangland slaying. The author explains why Roland West's deathbed confession was false (p.279). District Attorney Buron Fitts was rumored to be corrupt and inept (p.281).

552237:US	38002140	R1NBVY2IZ2KR5T	0871134993	540455254	The Dark Side of the Force: A True Story of Corruption and Murder in the LAPD	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The Case of the Convicted Cops	This 1993 book is about two rogue cops in the LAPD. They ran prostitutes, sold automatic weapons, committed insurance fraud, armed robbery, and murder-for-hire. Their plan to kill an erotic dancer to collect life insurance failed, and exposed their schemes to Federal investigators. This landmark ruling expanded First Amendment rights for freelance writers in California. This book lacks photographs and an index.    The crimes described here could not be excused as \\"overzealousness\\" or \\"emotional anger\\": human failings. They were well-planned and done in cold blood. These two officers had impeccable records, and had received many commendations. How could they have fooled their superiors and co-workers? Such villains are rare in police forces, even more so in the LAPD. This story was omitted from Darryl Gates' \\"Chief\\" (p.5). This true crime story could be the origin of the many dramatic stories in film, TV, and books since the 1980s.    Page 12 tells of the destitute conditions of the Adams family. Partly due to poor choices in handling money (no mention of the effects of advertising on people's choices). Chapter 2 tells of experiences in Vietnam that won't be printed in your local newspaper. Page 87 tells how two policemen collected their rent money in downtown Los Angeles and avoided the threat of robbery by acting as if they were part of organized crime! There are a lot of pages devoted to personal history, as if the author was paid by the word. This slows down the story. Both Ford and Von Villas seemed to go bad after a personal tragedy and the stress that followed. The crisis occurred when Joany dated \\"Doctor A.\\" and suspected he was trying to kill her! Bruce had contacted the ATF to protect himself. The ATF carefully checked out his story, and confided with the IAD of the LAPD (Chapter 13). On the night picked for the murder ATF agents went to watch the nude dancers; it was a dirty job but somebody had to do it (p.152).    California tends to have much longer trials than in other states due to judicial and legislature decisions (pp.202-203). Jury selections can also take longer (p.218). A finding of guilt may not be based on circumstantial evidence unless they cannot be explained by innocent acts, and are consistent with guilt (p.259). The jury quickly reached a verdict: guilty on most counts (p.261). Both Ford and Von Villas were found guilty of murdering Thomas Weed (the body was never found). Some said the guilty verdict resulted from their prior convictions (p.316). A wide range of people presented testimony on their behalf during the penalty phase; this was unprecedented (p.317). Both were sentenced to life without parole (p.349).	2004-08-18

He devoted time to 'The Court of Last Resort', which reviewed miscarriages of justice and often freed men who were wrongly convicted. Gardner clerked for a law firm, and passed the California Bar at 21. He was as successful in Ventura County as the fictional 'Perry Mason'. Erle was a prolific author: he dictated and others typed, he edited and it was retyped, proofread by others for final typing; an assembly line (p.16). 'Della Street' was a composite of the Walter sisters (p.18). 'Paul Drake' could have been based on Sam Hicks, a Wyoming cowboy who was Erle's ranch manager. Erle did not follow the standard device of a Dr. Watson to interact with a Sherlock Holmes; he used dialog and fast action for an explanation. Erle developed as a writer through hard work and careful study. Erle had no wish to write an ordinary type of detective story; he hated convention and rules for detective stories (p.26).<br /><br />Erle's mother was of Mayflower stock, both parents were descendants of Colonial New Englanders (p.31). They moved to California in 1899 for business reasons. Ma Gardner ran the household, even when her boys were grown men (p.34), Younger brother Ken was one of San Francisco's most respected physicians. Older brother Walter was in business in Illinois (p.35). Erle's talents were first shown in 4th grade back in Malden Mass (p.36). Erle's legal research foreshadowed his fiction (pp.55-56). His courtroom work was like Perry Mason! Erle created a plot machine out of cardboard to create plots from characters, situations, and complications (pp.82-83).<br /><br />Erle's contributions to American jurisprudence were his legal theories upheld by higher courts, and the principle of \\"limited dedication\\" which limited municipal rights (p.119). The formula for the Perry Mason stories is to have a protagonist who is dragged into danger, yet overcomes his problems (p.159). Manypages in this book tell of the conflicts between writer and agent to present material that met the current interests of the time. Gardner didn't put explicit dates in his stories so they wouldn't be old-fashioned in reprint (p.166). Erle had a wide circle of friends, mostly ordinary people, not writers.<br /><br />Erle covered the Sir Harry Oakes murder trial for the Hearst newspapers (p.238). The Perry Mason show was a hit from 1957 to 1966, but had its problems (pp.248-251). Perry Mason was popular because he fought for human rights and liberties (p.252). An article in the 'Saturday Evening Post' resulted in 'The Court of Last Resort', and an innocent man was saved from execution (p.256). But Erle eventually resigned from the CLR (pp.264-5). Gardner's impact on the administration of justice cannot be overemphasized (p.266)! Erle helped to bring about the Supreme Court ruling than an indigent accused is entitled to legal help, and experts, and to study the prosecution's evidence (p.267). One reason for Erle's success was giving reliable data in his books. The Bibliography lists his work from 1921 to 1973 (pp. 312-341).	2004-08-17

They feature his private detective \\"Philip Marlowe\\". Marlowe is hired to find a missing person and this leads to a murder.<br /><br />The Big Sleep<br />Philip Marlowe is called to wealthy General Sternwood's estate to investigate the gambling debts of is youngest daughter. The husband of his older daughter has suddenly disappeared. Is there a connection? The story turns up blackmail, nude photos, drugs, and murder in this wealthy family.<br /><br />The High Window<br />Philip Marlowe is called by a rich widow to recover property stolen by a member of her family. Her son married a nightclub singer against her wishes. The Brasher Doubloon is a very rare gold coin about the size of a half-dollar. Marlowe must find the missing daughter-in-law and also get the rare coin back. The police can't be involved because it's a family matter.<br /><br />The Lady in the Lake<br />Philip Marlowe got a job to locate a missing wife who said she was going for a Mexican divorce. But Chris Lavery doesn't know anything. Marlowe drives to Little Fawn Lake to inspect Crystal's last known location. He talks to the caretaker Bill Chess whose wife also left him. They walk around the lake and see something below the water. Chess' missing wife Muriel is found! Sheriff Patton questions Bill Chess. Crystal and Muriel both disappeared at the same time. Marlowe guessed what happened. There is an end to the mystery. It will be kept out of the newspapers<br /><br />The Long Goodbye<br />Philip Marlowe knew Terry Lennox. One morning Terry shows up to ask for a ride to an airport. When Marlowe returns home he finds police detectives from Homicide waiting for him: Terry's wife was murdered. Marlowe is held until somebody paid a lawyer to represent him. There was little in the newspapers. Marlowe is released after a shocking surprise. Could Terry kill in such a brutal manner? If not, was he just a fall guy? Mrs Roger Wade visits Marlowe at home; her husband has been missing for 3 days. Marlowe uses his one clue and begins investigating. Marlowe finds Roger Wade.<br /><br />Playback<br />Philip Marlowe received an early morning telephone call to follow a passenger on the Super Chief. Marlowe knows little about this job. He learns others are interested for their own reasons. Was she a murderess who got off because of a quirk in the law? Is there a nasty blackmailer pestering Eleanor King? Will somebody stop him? Marlowe has the same kind of adventures with the same kind of people that you find in his earlier work.<br /><br />Farewell, My Lovely<br />Philip Marlowe is looking for a missing husband on Central Avenue. He sees a big man to into \\"Florian's\\" place to look for his old girl friend Velma. There is a fight and a dead body. The police ask Marlowe to look into this case - as a favor. The investigation results in more dead bodies until that old girl friend is discovered.	2004-08-14

He notices a big man walk into double swinging doors, almost immediately a youth is thrown through the air into the gutter. Marlowe looks in, and is taken upstairs by Moose Malloy. More violence breaks out while Malloy searches for Velma. Marlowe calls the police to report the problem. The police lieutenant strongly suggests that Marlowe should look for Velma. Marlowe gathers information, and looks up Mrs. Florian, wife of the now dead owner of this bar. Mrs. Florian says that Velma is dead, and gives Marlowe a picture of Velma. Marlowe gives her his card, and reports back to Detective Lieutenant Nulty. <br /> <br />When Marlowe returns to his office, he gets a phone call hiring him by a stranger to act as his bodyguard. Marlowe accompanies Marriott to a deserted country spot to pay off a jewel thief. Marlowe leaves the car to make the payoff, but nobody is around. When he returns to the car he finds Marriott dead. A young woman shows up and gives Marlowe a ride to his car. Marlowe returns to the West Los Angeles police station to report another murder. <br /> <br />Marlowe continues to gather more facts. Marlowe has meetings and adventures in pursuit of the truth. The story effectively exposes the crookedness of Bay City politics, and the corruption of the rich and powerful. The ending seems tacked-on to meet the moral conventions of the time: nobody gets away with murder, not in fiction. The author sort of admits this in the last chapter: \\"we'd never have convicted her\\". If the trial and scandal hurt her older husband, she'd be a rich widow. If not, they could move away from this scandal and notoriety. <br />	2004-08-14

She came from Kansas to track down her brother Orrin; he moved to Los Angeles a year earlier and has stopped writing home. Marlowe visits Orrin's last address, a rooming house in the seedy part of town. The room now contains G. W. Hicks, who is moving out, and knows nothing. When Marlowe leaves, he notices the manager is now dead! Later Marlowe receives a phone call, hiring him for a job. When Marlowe shows up at the hotel room, he finds a dead G. W. Hicks, killed with an ice pick like the rooming house manager. Somebody searched the room, but Marlowe found what they missed. The Police are called again. Marlowe uses the claim check to retrieve photographic prints. The hotel detective noticed a woman visitor, and gives Marlowe her license plate number. Now the investigation continues into new territory. <br /> <br />The story echoes \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\" and other stories. A private detective is hired to find somebody. The client doesn't tell the Whole Truth. Coincidences and complications pop up to carry the story forward. The Whole Truth isn't revealed until the last pages, and the final deaths which tie up the story without loose ends. Again, the scandals and crimes that created the murders aren't revealed until the end. There are only shades of gray, no blacks and white. All the characters have something to hide. A recurring theme in Chandler's stories is that crime leads to blackmail, and blackmail leads to murder. Can a snapshot of a couple at a restaurant result in six dead bodies? Chandler makes it believable. <br />	2004-08-14

A beautiful woman has run a barbed wire fence through the middle of his house! Morley Eden paid a contractor to build a house on a lot, but half the lot belonged to his wife, and now she has claimed her share. Chapter One explains how this happened. Perry visits Judge Goodwin to learn about his decision in this case. The Judge hopes to use this conflict against the contractor Loring Carson. Perry Mason visits Nadine Palmer to tell her about Morley Eden's suit against Loring Carson. Nadine was wrongly accused in Loring's divorce suit, and she will get unwanted publicity (Chapter Five). When the press conference is held inside Morley Eden's part of the house they find the dead body of Loring Carson. The reporters cluster around the body like sharks in a feeding frenzy.<br /><br />Perry calls the police, then Paul Drake so he can trace Nadine Palmer. Vivian Carson arrives home and is shocked to hear of the murder on the other side of the house. Perry questions Morley about his whereabouts. Lt. Tragg questions Vivian about her activities, then searches around the house and pool. Perry catches a plane to Las Vegas to talk to the woman who knew Loring Carson. Genevieve explains the policies of gambling (Chapter Ten). [Good advice for everyone!] Perry finds Nadine and talks to her until someone official shows up.<br /><br />In Chapter Eleven Perry finds a briefcase planted in his hotel room, and tries to neutralize it, then returns to the gambling tables. Perry finds that Genevieve just got back from Los Angeles. Then the police arrive to question Perry about a trip. The police don't believe his answers and advise him to leave. So Perry returns to Los Angeles. \\"The best defense to circumstantial evidence ... is the truth\\" (Chapter Twelve). Morley and Vivian will be charged with the murder of Loring.<br /><br />The newspapers report on this case of sex, mystery, drama, missing money, and an unusual setting. The high point is when Nadine testifies to what she saw at Morley Eden's house on the day of the murder (Chapter Thirteen). The cross-examination of Nadine begins in Chapter Fifteen. Perry asks a question that results in Nadine's fingerprints being taken. Perry calls Lt. Tragg to testify about the briefcase found in Perry's room and the unknown fingerprints on it. In his closing argument Perry uses the facts to arrive at a different explanation from the prosecution's theory. Finding fingerprints of a person will not tell you when they were made. Perry asks the jury to compare the sets of fingerprints and decide for themselves. The jury returned with a not guilty verdict. Chapter Sixteen provides a conclusion to this mystery.<br /><br />This story was published after Erle Stanley Gardner's death. Like other stories, it implicitly critiques the morals and lifestyles of middle-class entrepreneurs.	2004-08-13

Her sister, Mae Farr, moved to Los Angeles a year ago. But her letters stopped coming, and Sylvia Farr wants her found. Perry advises Sylvia to contact Paul Drake (Perry noticed discrepancies in her dress). Mae is wanted for check forgery! Perry will represent the sister. Mae's boy friend Harold Anders from back home shows up, and argues with Penn Wentworth (whose signature was forged). Later, Harold and Mae show up at Della Street's apartment: Penn Wentworth was shot while struggling with Mae! Harold was near, and they came to Perry for help. Perry quickly decides what must be done, and takes Mae back to the yacht. But the yacht has sailed away! (Perry is more involved in detection than usual.)    Perry's client doesn't tell the whole truth, and her friend Harold doesn't follow Perry's advice. Wentworth had complications in his personal life. The police were able to find Mae Farr, and her boyfriend (who told all). The police believe Perry found Harold's gun. Penn's partner offers to suppress evidence; Perry refuses. More complications arise, including a witness who asks for money. Page 166 tells how Paul Drake would slow the car speed, then speed up again. [This is one way to check if you're being followed.] The cross-examination at the Preliminary Hearing brings out facts from a surprise witness that results in the clearing of Mae Farr. All seems to end happily for Mae Farr and Harold Anders. The most important advice in this book is Perry's advice on staying sober at a party: join in the first drinks, then stop (the others won't notice).    Mason skates very close to the edges in this story. It was completed before Erle Stanley Gardner's death, but had not been checked and polished. The back cover shows the author with a hearing aid from decades earlier. Using a large format camera instead of 120 film also suggests a date before the 1960s. I wonder if the testimony about the \\"interurban busline\\" suggests a date after the 1940s? The unconventional courtroom practices of the Justice of the Peace suggests an earlier time than the 1960s.	2004-08-13

It was based on a true crime in the Richmond Virginia area. A psychopath kills young women who live alone, striking in the early hours of Saturday. There seems to be no other pattern to the murders. The victims are tortured before they are strangled. There are few clues and no fingerprints. One victim is married, but lived alone as her husband lived away Monday to Friday; the husband becomes the chief suspect, as usual.    This story is told from the viewpoint of Kay Scarpetta ME, a single woman who has a high position in a man's world. Kay is resented by some. There is a sub-plot about a state Attorney-General who is a secret rapist. [What did she know and when did she know it?] There are many pages of details about the Medical Examiner's office. The author previously worked for that office, and as a police reporter. [My opinion is that the many details and characterizations slow the pace of action.] Kay's niece Lucy is shown as being a neglected and emotionally abused child; how will she turn out? Cornwell shows her knowledge of personal computers and software.    Agatha Christie's \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" was a best seller, although it violated the conventions of mystery fiction. This book also does that, but it seems more based on reality that way. Will Cornwell's future novels do as well? Does her political outlook find favor with her audience?	2004-08-07

Perry gets Paul Drake to investigate. Paul explains a &quot;rough shadow&quot; and a &quot;roper&quot;. The first follows a subject in such a way as to be noticed (a &quot;smooth shadow&quot; keeps far away from the subject). A &quot;roper&quot; tries to befriend the subject in a casual way to gain their confidence. The &quot;roper&quot; will admit to illegal or unethical acts in order to draw out a similar confidence from the subject. [You may encounter this in your workplace.] Selma is friendly with a wealthy man; some of his nephews and nieces regard Selma as a fortune hunter! The shadow is the boyfrined of the niece who dislikes Selma. The complication is that Selma's husband Bill died a year ago of food poisoning, and some gossip that his wife took advantage of this to poison him! <br />  <br /> Selma's deceased husband is exhumed; test show arsenic. Selma also had been buying arsenic until her husband died. A bottle of this arsenic was found hidden by the barbecue grill where Selma's husband got sick. &quot;The prosecution's evidence always seems convincing,&quot; Mason said. Who else could have a motive to murder except the spouse? <br />  <br /> Perry's client listens to bad advice, and acts foolishly by flying to El Paso. Perry arrives, and is able to salvage her mistake, and turn it around (Chapters 9 & 10). Chapter 13 tells how Perry uses a polygraph expert to prove Selma's innocence. One example of this was in the Sam Sheppard case; family members proved they had never heard Dr. Sam Sheppard say anything indicative of guilt. [Erle Stanley Gardner kept up with current events.] But courts won't allow a polygraph test to determin guilt. &quot;It's very, very possible to frame a person for murder,&quot; Mason said. <br />  <br /> On the last day of the trial we learn that Selma Anson has just married Delane Arlington, who found the bottle of poison. A spouse cannot testify against another spouse. But Perry says Delane will testify voluntarily! Lt. Tragg testifies that the police found no bottle of poison (clearly marked) when they previously searched the whole area of the barbecue grill. The manufacturer of this poison (used in taxidermy) testified it was freshly manufactured within three months. The owner of the taxidermy supply store identifies the customer who bought this poison. Once all the facts are learned, Perry's client is found not guilty by the Judge. The customers who bought this poison are arrested for evidence tampering; and you know what's next. <br />	2004-08-04

The evil pair are neutralized, and Marlowe finds the hidden pearls.<br /><br />\\"Red Wind\\" begins with Marlowe drinking a beer at a bar, watching another man drink rye. A stranger walks in for a drink. The rye drinker suddenly shoots him, and walks out the door. Now the mystery begins: strangers pop up, then disappear. Coincidences that are part of the story appear. The ending has an \\"O. Henry\\" touch. Illusions fall, and reveal a sad reality. [This is the most dramatic story in this book.]	2004-08-02

Fiction has always tried to be realistic, but tastes change (perceptions of reality). Detective stories often outsell the best-sellers of yesteryear (perhaps because the situations they describe are always current, even if the language and costumes change). Chandler contrasts the writings of Hammett and others to the classic post-WW One fiction (which is usually contained in the houses of the rich and powerful). Chandler lists the problems with A.A. Milne's &quot;The Red House Mystery&quot;. They are too contrived, and disregard life in the real world. The realism of Hammett (and others) is how they describe the world that is seldom reported in your daily newspaper, except obliquely (&quot;Zoning Board Adopts Changes&quot;). This essay offers wisdom and an overview of detective stories. <br />  <br /> &quot;Pearls Are A Nuisance&quot; reads like a satire on detective stories. Walter represents the classic wealthy detective of English fiction, Henry the hard-boiled detective of American fiction. They try to recover a stolen pearl necklace, which is &quot;Dutch&quot; (slang for fake). But a high ransom tells Walter they are real. Walter recovers the pearls in a surprise ending. <br /> &quot;Spanish Blood&quot; starts with the murder of a political opponent. A detective is assigned to search the murdered man's country cabin - and finds a dead body! Sam finds an informer and speaks to him before he is shot. Sam follows this lead, but winds up captured. Sam's speech leads to more dead bodies, and the case is now closed. The last pages present the shocking surprise ending. <br />  <br /> &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; begins with a musician waking up the whole floor in a hotel. The &quot;night clerk&quot; tosses him out; but the musician knows the owner, so Steve is canned. Steve looks up an address, and finds the first body. He meets more people, and finds more bodies. When he returns to the hotel, an old killing is brought up. Following this clue leads to the murderers, and the old scandal that caused them. <br /> &quot;I'll Be Waiting&quot; is about one-night's events at a hotel. A woman checks in and tells the night clerk she's waiting for a visitor. The porter tells Tony that a stranger wants to see him (a warning about another guest). Tony warns this guest, who quickly leaves. But something happens that affects Tony's family. <br />  <br />	2004-08-02

His research into their financial and business practices revealed their involvement in the military-industrial complex and the political, banking, and armaments scandals that could have led to impeachment in other times (p.ix). This book investigates the Bush family over four generations; the corporate media has not done this (p.xi). The Bush dynasty favors energy, defense, the Pentagon and CIA, and tax breaks for the investor class. Page 3 explains why the family, not just an individual, must be studied: their network. The succession of a son to his father's Presidency is unprecedented in American history. The oppression of American families in the 1980s and 1990s (stress on two-earner households, lengthened work hours, daycare, and taxes) was cynically used to promote reaction: those who caused this profited politically from people's anger (p.6). Phillips says the American political system is now in a perilous state. He notes that both brothers were made governors in the 1990s, but can't tell what strings were pulled (p.19).   Chapter 1 provides a summary of the Walker and Bush families and their growing wealth and importance. The purpose of professional sports is to divert popular attention from rising inequality, like during Imperial Rome (p.62). The rise of corporations after the Civil War, with prolonged existence and legal rights, provided the framework for a new aristocracy (p.64). The tax advantages for investment income results in less equality. Chapter 2 explains the increasing dynastization of America. Chapter 3 says Bush Sr.'s 1992 defeat was due to Ross Perot and Patrick Buchanan - as if this was a natural disaster, and not the result of economic policies. Page 78 lists similarities between Dan Quayle and George W. Bush. Pages 88-89 bring up suspected scandals in George W. Bush's past. Was there a cover-up? The change in the polls show the effects of relentless propaganda in the corporate media (p.91). The demonization of Clinton made Bush Jr. look good. This chapter recounts the voting chicanery by the Bush team.   Chapter 4 notes that Texas has replaced California as a source of Presidents. New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco have more extremes of wealth and income than Texas. But Texas, Louisiana, and New York are the states with the widest gaps. Texas spends the least per capita (p.114). [It has a regressive sales tax, and no income tax.] Midland is an Ivy League beachhead with ties to Wall Street (p.120). Page 124 shows why George W. made the best family candidate. Bush Sr.'s reign showed a loss of income and jobs (p.126) - just like Jr. Taxes on the middle class went up to keep taxes lower on the rich (p.127). Lowering taxes on the super-rich created huge budget deficits. Texas' politics created the highest level of cancer risk (p.139). Leaving social services to private charity benefits the rich (p.141).  Chapter 5 tells of the links to Enron and Halliburton. The politics of &#34;energy deregulation&#34; were to make Big Oil richer (pp.156-7). Pages 160-1 tell of the collusion between Enron, the World Bank,and the US Export-Import Bank, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. California opened its electricity market first, and later experienced the results. Enron was a major funder for the Florida recount (p.163). Deregulation of electricity in Great Britain was followed by price spikes, consumer gouging, service complaints, and reliability problems (p.167). The Enron scandal was much worse than Teapot Dome. Enron paid off the Bush family by campaign contributions, joint investments, speech payments, etc. (p.170). World Wars I and II had major oil strategy components for each side (p.176). [And so may World War III.] Read the &#34;Afterword&#34; if nothing else. I believe this book tries to cover too much in too few pages. Kevin Phillips didn't like the Bushes when he was involved in GOP politics, and better understands why (p.334).	2004-07-30

Its aim is to help you to extend and enhance your PC, and is intended for intermediate to advanced users. The operating system is Windows 95, the then latest version. It covers topics that are rarely explained in the monthly hobby magazines. This provides an objective treatment instead of one oriented to the advertisers. You should know that you rarely ''repair'' a PC or its components. Failing components are replaced by new ones, like batteries in a flashlight. Upgrading is much more likely, especially with a slightly older PC. This book is written on a level that the average person can understand. The Glossary defines the terms used, the Index covers the preceding pages. Chapter 4 'Troubleshooting' should be read thoroughly. Part II explains the inside workings of a PC. CD-RW has replaced the often trouble-prone tape back-up devices. AGP has supplanted PCI graphic cards. Chapter 12 'Hard Disks' does not document the different jumper settings for IDE devices (p.260). That is too important to omit! Figure 8.1 on page 173 does not show soldered cache. Page 233 says a motherboard with a single IDE controller cannot support a CD-ROM drive (not true for a 386 or 486 made after 1990). <br />  <br /> Whether you read the whole book page by page, skim through it, or just read selected topics, you will become more knowledgeable about the components that make up a personal computer.

This book is dedicated to Dr. Daniel J. Condon the Medical Examiner of Maricopa County Arizona who consulted on a Court of Last Resort case.<br /><br />Nadine Farr had emotional problems, and visited a psychiatrist. She is given sodium pentothal and her answers are recorded on tape. During the questioning she admits to poisoning her Uncle. Dr. Denair consults Perry Mason to find out if this is confidential, or must be reported to the police. Perry points out a confession to a crime is not confidential, but the statements of a drugged person are not reliable in a court of law since they may be imagined. Dr. Denair brings Nadine Farr to consult with Perry Mason. But the nurse present at the treatment tells this to her policeman boyfriend, and the tape recording is obtained with a search warrant by the police.<br /><br />The story is that Nadine threw away the poison. Perry recovers the bottle and has it analyzed - a sugar substitute! But the police do their homework and find a second bottle with the poison. We learn that Nadine's boyfriend says he found that bottle and flushed it away. We also learn that Jackson Newburn also threw away the poison! The case goes to court, Hamilton Burger accusing Perry of substituting false evidence. This looks like a slam-dunk for Burger until Perry personally inspects the evidence and notices a detail that will clear Nadine Farr of murder, Perry of fabricating evidence, and get a confession from a witness pointing to the real murderer. The scandals that generated this crime are mentioned at the ending.	2004-07-27

Cadman invented a method to detect alcohol in the blood stream quickly and accurately, thereby advancing forensic science. Two examples in determining the cause of death are given.    A visitor consults with Perry Mason, but refuses to give her name. Her payment buys credibility (like for Spade & Archer in \\"The Maltese Falcon\\"). Perry has Paul Drake investigate her, after reading her coded ad in the classified section. Chapter 3 educates the reader on the weakness of eyewitness evidence [when the person identified is a complete stranger]. Paul Drake investigates her backtrail, and identifies Diana Douglas. Perry visits Diana to tell of the 'routine audit' at her company (imports items that are paid in cash only). There is a need to remove Diana and send her home; a substitute replaces her when the stranger visits. There is a request for a pay-off that Perry refuses. Later this blackmailer is found murdered, Diana's credit card is in his room. The murder weapon is traced to Diana, and she is arrested and brought back to Los Angeles.    Perry and Paul continue the investigation. Bit by bit the truth is extracted from Diana. She did visit the blackmailer, but found him dead. She took the gun because she recognized it as belonging to her now dead brother! Just when you think its curtains for her, Perry summons and questions a few of her coworkers. The unusual fact of an old coat among new clothes is explained. Diana is freed once the facts point to a new suspect. Again, \\"murder is caused by love or money, to get it or to keep it\\". The scandal that led to the murder is revealed at the end. Its not a good idea to spread workplace gossip around. This story says carrying a pistol on an airplane was not unusual then. This is Erle Stanley Gardner's last work. He died just after it was published.	2004-07-27

Ken Corning protected the rights of the unjustly accused who were framed by bribed city officials and their crooked police. Erle Stanley Gardner (1889-1970) then went on to create the immensely popular Perry Mason novels that inspired movies, and a radio and television series. Gardner was a noted attorney who investigated miscarriages of justice in his Court of Last Resort. He was well read in psychology, criminology, forensic medicine, and penology.  Justice is not served in the ideal, but Corning's clients walk. These stories are about municipal crime and corruption, and are similar to the stories of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and others. They reflect popular interests of the time. Since the 1950s these kind of stories have been scarce. (I suspect censorship and the rise of powerful corporations that now control the media.) There is one difference between the above authors and fantasy heroes. Sam Spade, Phillip Marlowe, and Perry Mason all make sure they get their money up front. Fantasy heroes (The Lone Ranger, Superman, etc.) don't seem to need money, as if they were on a government payroll. Does this reflect the loss of small owner-operated businesses?<br /><br />'Honest Money' is the story of a woman who had a minor auto accident. She knows too much, and is arrested for a felony; her husband is assassinated. After Ken Corning investigates, she is released and paid off.<br /><br />'The Top Comes Off' begins with a wife looking to clear her husband of a murder charge; she shot her boyfriend in the latter's office. But there is a complication: the lights went out before the shooting. Ken Corning finds out what really happened, and her husband is cleared.<br /><br />'Close Call' tells how the editor of an anti-administration newspaper was deliberately killed by a nit-and-run car. This car was stolen, used for the killing, then put back as forged evidence. The driver of the hit-and-run car may have been the witness against the reformer. But the guilty flee when no man pursues.<br /><br />'Making the Breaks' tells how stolen money is planted for a frame-up. Lawyer Corning defends a man accused of murder; he thinks it was a frame-up, and needs a witness. If Corning can't catch a break, he makes a break.<br /><br />'Devil's Fire' is about a murder on the street. A fleeing man is arrested, Corning defends George Pyle. A witness says Pyle threw away a gun. But Corning uses a contest to pick out the best female shooter. The contest leads to the real killer, and frees George Pyle.<br /><br />'Blackmail with Lead' tells how Sam Driver is found with a dead body in his car. A witness saw two men put something into Driver's flivver. But after she is arrested for possessing booze her memory fails. Corning's investigation leads to the reason for the killing, and the cover-up. The case against Driver is then dismissed.	2004-07-27

This collection of millions of notebooks, letters, memoranda, charts, lists, and even phrases are in a Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. The authors distilled these papers into a 286 page book that has a Bibliography and Index. The Foreword acknowledges the people who helped the authors. <br />  <br /> Erle Stanley Gardner set a record for the 'Guinness Book of World Records' as the best selling author. Gardner had ten year's experience as a trial lawyer, intensive study and writing, a hyperactive personality, and an incredibly agile imagination. Gardner became the greatest writer of mystery fiction who ever lived, only being outsold worldwide by the Bible (p.14). Gardner dropped out of college, clerked for a law firm, and passed the California bar at 21. he learned the importance of keeping records. ESG was meticulous in the use of facts in his fiction, since Perry Mason was scrutinized by lawyers. <br />  <br /> Gardner's first stories were to wood pulp magazines. Then for the slick magazines, movies, television. There was even a short-lived comic strip (p.189). Some called it 'escapist literature', but they always dealt with real-world troubles than made humdrum lives seem better off. Chapter 4 lists what could be learned from writing for the pulps. These magazines were always looking for new writers who could be paid lower rates (Chapter 5). Gardner paid a disabled veteran to solicit comments on stories (p.84); this feedback was used in writing stories. Gardner also analyzed stories for their appeal (p.89). 'A single man, unaided, overcomes difficulties by the power that is within him' describes a lot of popular fiction (p.90). Gardner's comments are still educational (pp.93-104). This explains why Perry Mason's clients must never be guilty (p.99). A mystery consists of a series of interesting events with sinister implications, the logic of which cannot be instantly comprehended (p.101). To improve production, Gardner bought one of the first electrical typewriter (a Woodstock), but later switched entirely to dictations machines (p.109). Chapter 8 describes his writing life. <br />  <br />The titles for Perry Mason novels usually came from the opening mystery, rather than from the principal plot. They were carefully chosen to attract readers (pp.193-4). When ESG was in 'financial straits' he developed a new series writing a 'A.A.Fair' with a new style. Page 202 tells how he planted evidence to support the existence of this author. [But the 'legal skulduggery' suggested ESG]. Gardner wrote books for readers, not for snobbish critics. Gardner would start with an incidental mystery to intrigue the reader and introduce the characters. Then the murder would occur; it would be result of basic human motivation. As in life, there would be conflicts and obstacle to goals. There were few murders from a sudden rush of anger or passion. The murderer would be found out once false stories and clues were found out; this was his mystery story. There would be some minor facts that wouldn't mesh with the cover story; this would lead to the solution. Appendix I lists his 'Fluid or Unstatic Theory of Plots'. The other Appendices show Gardner's organized method for dealing with plots. What could Gardner have done with a personal computer in place of his mechanical plotting device? <br />  <br />	2004-07-27

General Webster's wife disapproves of American soldiers accompanying Japanese girls; and the General's wife commands the General. Eileen wants a regular marriage, not spending years of loneliness as a stateside Officer's wife.<br /><br /> At Airman Kelly's wedding, Major Gruver learns the secret of Japanese women: they make their men feel important. Sometimes a Congressman will get a special bill passed to allow an American to bring his Japanese wife stateside. But American officialdom did everything to prevent these marriages. The story continues with Major Gruver learning more about Japanese culture - and a Japanese girl! [Little hints point to an oncoming tragedy.] Michener paints word-pictures of Japan that match his descriptions of islands in the South Pacific.

An autopsy can uncover the facts of a murder so no subsequent fabrication can cover it up. A medical examiner will find clues that a less thoroughly trained individual could miss. The official autopsies in Mexico City are about equal in number to New York city.    A young couple come to Perry Mason on a matter of life and death. Linda's wealthy widowed aunt has fallen in love with a stranger, withdrawn a small fortune, and traveled to Los Angeles. Linda is sure her aunt's fiancee is planning to murder her for her money. Perry Mason suggests  they hire a private investigator to investigate the aunt's fiancee. They find that this fiancee, aside from his name, does not seem to exist. His bank account emptied and closed, his car sold, his apartment closed out, and no known friends and associates. All fingerprints were wiped clean! Perry Mason learns that the aunt and her fiancee will be going to Arizona to get married. Perry, Della, and Paul fly to Yuma to further investigate. Most of the story takes place here, not in Los Angeles.    They miss the sought couple at the state line inspection station, but locate them later. Linda's boyfriend shows up; he had tried to follow the pair. The aunt's fiancee is later found poisoned, and the aunt is arrested for the murder! Many surprising events continue to happen until the very end. [Note how some seeming minor character in the background turns out to be the real killer.] The very active Perry Mason earns his fee by defending the aunt. The villains are exposed at the end so justice triumphs. This fast moving story has as many surprises as an amusement park ride in a \\"haunted house\\". This book is limited by the censorship of its day, but you can read between the lines.	2004-07-21

His investigations have often refuted the arguments of defense attorneys.<br /><br />Perry Mason gets a very unusual call: a woman wants him to cross-examine her husband to  determine if his story will stand up. John Kirby shows up to say he was at a sales meeting that  lasted to 11 pm at night. On the way home he saw a young woman carrying a one gallon gasoline can. He gave her a lift, but her car had disappeared. So he took her to a motel, registered as man and wife, then drove home. Kirby told his wife this story, and she insisted they drive to the motel to help the young woman; but she had disappeared. And the one gallon can was no longer in Kirby's car. After Kirby leaves, Della Street now connects this to an attack on a Doctor Babb  who lives in the suburbs. A young woman was seen running from the Doctor's house, and she fits the description of Kirby's rider. The name \\"Kirby\\" was found on the Doctor's appointment book. Paul Drake is called to investigate.<br /><br />This is another story with numerous suspects. Perry Mason soon finds Kirby's story had left out  quite a few details. Before the Doctor died he mentioned his attacker: \\"John Kirby\\", but witnesses  say John Kirby did not leave his car. The name of the young woman was also in the Doctor's appointment book! John Kirby is arrested, and Perry defends him at the preliminary hearing. Doctor Babb had been running a baby mill. Young women would give up their babies so a married woman could present an heir. [The implications about society are not discussed.] The records of these adoptions could provide a blackmailer with lucrative opportunities.

As special counsel to a convicted murderer awaiting execution he found new evidence and argued this case to get a reversal of conviction by the Louisiana Supreme Court.    A contractor is getting grief from building inspectors on a very important job. He is advised to consult with a \\"public relations expert\\" (who quotes a price to fix the problems). As Ansley leaves the estate, he has a narrow escape from an accident; the other car overturns. Ansley sees a young woman, who calls for  help and a ride home to her apartment. But something worries him. He calls on Perry Mason for advice. When Perry checks up, he finds this woman used a false identity; and her car was stolen. The next day the \\"public relations expert\\" is found murdered; the gun that did is found in Ansley's car. Perry Mason and Paul Drake must quickly investigate to uncover the facts. They track down the woman from the fake address (using a real person's identity can provide a clue to the imposter). An undeveloped negative of the model is found in the murdered man's camera (is it proof she was the last person to see him alive?).    Using the facts uncovered by the investigation Perry Mason gets the charges against Ansley dropped at the preliminary hearing. The model is arrested for the murder; she worked at the store where the murder weapon was stolen. But she hires Perry Mason as her advocate, and Perry Mason gets the charges dropped again! By now the facts develop to point to the real killer. The remarks of Lieutenant Tragg on driving to avoid accidents are still valuable.  If you can only read one Perry Mason mystery, this provides a good example of Erle Stanley Gardner's stories.	2004-07-17

Dr. Minter devotes his `spare time' to studying the problems of evidence for law enforcement, and the part of the citizen in co-operating with various law enforcement agencies. Dr. Minter is a member of the Board of Regents at the University of Texas, and holds many offices in the field of education, banking, and medicine.<br /><br />The story opens with a proxy fight to gain control of an Oil Exploration Company. Should a company distribute profits, or invest them for greater profits in the future? The CEO gets a phone call that promises him confidential information about his rival's proxies. Conway must go to a room in a hotel for this document. When he enters, a half-dressed woman acts surprised, and waves a gun at him. Conway disarms her, and leaves; he finds one bullet discharged. Thinking this was a set-up to entrap him, he consults Perry Mason. Mason & Drake return to the room to find the body of a young woman - a different person from earlier! Now they must work fast to investigate these strange events, and clear Mason's client. Mason's clients are never really guilty; that's the rule of this series. Also, the real killer is revealed only in the last pages, even if others seem culpable of something.<br /><br />Examining stomach contents can time the death once they know when the victim ate their last meal. The position after time of death is indicated by lividity. It takes time for lividity to be established. The fatal bullet can be traced to the pistol, if the latter can be found. This book uses these and other facts to create a puzzling mystery that will entertain you until the last page. Circumstantial evidence is the best evidence, but it can be misinterpreted. If salad, turkey, potatoes, and peas are in the victim's stomach, but they only ordered the first three items, how toaccount for this discrepancy? The plot takes precedence over character development (which is implicit for adults); this keeps the story moving along. The money figures are many decades out of date.	2004-07-17

A budding writer is found stabbed to death in her home. The 27 cuts were done in a frenzy of hatred, or by a crazed madman. But how did he enter the home of a frightened woman? [Readers of G. K. Chesterton's \\"The Invisible Man\\" can guess.] Soon afterwards a Pulitzer Prize winning novelist, who had befriended Beryl years earlier, is also found murdered outside his home. His sister, who lived with him, soon died afterwards under questionable circumstances. A strange NY lawyer seeks the missing manuscript of Beryl. Medical Examiner Scarpetta begins to investigate the background of Beryl. This takes up most of the book until the killer is caught.<br />Cornwell describes various scenes within official agencies; she had been a police reporter, employee of the Medical Examiner office, and a volunteer police officer. She uses this experience to provide background facts for her story. My opinion is that Cornwell spent a lot of words describing Dr. Scarpetta. Cornwell describes her heroine as amoral in an amoral world (is she headed for a nervous breakdown?). The motive of the killer seems contrived, almost as an afterthought. It could have happened that way, but it seems like a deus ex machina ending. Would a real ME spend all that time to investigate Beryl's murder? There are many gay characters in this book as background. Is this some sort of message?	2004-07-13

Walker and begins by discussing circumstantial evidence, and the various inferences that can be drawn from a fact. It tells what scientific investigation can deduce from a discarded coat along a highway. Often an explanation for some physical clue may turn out to be incorrect. Gardner uses an example from Doctor Joseph T. Walker, an officer of the Massachusetts State Police, and that discarded coat. Doctor Walker has brought murderers to justice and prevented the unjust conviction of the innocent.    This story is as fast moving as a big roller coaster, with as many twists and turns to hold your interest until the last page. Erle Stanley Gardner's taut and sparse prose keeps the story moving along. It is one of the best \\"Perry Mason\\" mysteries, superior to any film or TV drama.    This book starts out when a practical nurse consults with Perry Mason over a possible murder, and ask how to prevent a murder! Next this nurse is arrested for stealing jewelry from her employer; Perry Mason defends her successfully. The problem is assigning guilt when there are numerous suspects. But this story is just starting! Then the patient she cares for is murdered by arsenic. The patient's sister is arrested; she hires Perry Mason to defend her. Now the story picks up speed, and we see numerous twists and surprises to this story. Just how Perry's client is not guilty of this murder comes out at the surprise ending.	2004-07-12

The author begins Chapter 2 by citing the morality of Calvin and Wesley as to amassing as much wealth as they can, and an 18th century traveler as to the worship of self-interest (also true of other peoples?). There is also the tradition of frugality and plain living, which made a virtue out of a necessity. The author betrays a naive and ascetic outlook in claiming the Roosevelts entered politics for &quot;unselfish reasons&quot; (p.22). Government power leads to riches, in all times and places (Kevin Phillips &quot;Wealth and Democracy&quot;). The author says John F. Kennedy opposed the Titans of Wealth (p.23). But every President represents some parts of the ruling classes, and act for its interests. It is also true that JFK represented change, and a threat to parts of the ruling classes and their &quot;order of things&quot; (p.28). JFK's father was one of the twenty richest men in America, but JFK attracted a huge majority from the minorities (p.31). JFK's politics were to be friendly with everyone. His wealth and power created fear among many Americans. One change was the flaunting of wealth and style, a change from Truman and Eisenhower (p.42). Critics sniped at Jacqueline's spending, the lifestyle of the rich and famous.<br />Chapter 4 notes the changes of the Kennedy administration, more striking in retrospect. The author talks of the &quot;aristocratic and plutocratic conception&quot; of the Kennedy family, and their resentment by many of the well-to-do (jealousy or envy?). Chapter 6 tells of the gangland murders in the Boston area (p.89), and the contacts between &quot;millionaire pillars of the community&quot;. [Are they still protected by politicians? Does this explain the Massachusetts laws against Second Amendment rights?] Pages 112-113 list JFK's novel Cabinet appointees; some could have served in Eisenhower's Administration. Page 132 tells of the Defense Dept. control of the American economy. The taxes of the many support the corporations owned by the few. These 'make work' projects prevented another after-war economic depression (p.151). Peace would bring a terrific blow to the oil industry (p.153). The &quot;Alliance For Progress&quot; led to more military coups, and forced capital to flow to the U.S. (p.158). Big Business feared the Kennedy administration (p.174). Chapter 10 explains how Big Oil controls governments (p.189). [You'll never read this in newspapers and magazines!]<br />Chapter 13 is the heart of this 1968 book - it says the assassination was driven by politics and arranged by a &quot;Committee&quot;. It depended on powerful men in the Government who would no interfere (p.288). Chapter 16, and others, are an antidote to the fiction of the Warren Report. Chapter 20 ends the book. The deaths of JFK and RFK were not accidents. [What about JFK Jr.?] The 1960s saw many changes in America (p.375). [One index of the 1960s is that people were economically better off than the decades before or after.] But this chapter's ending became outdated. Thirty-five years later some youthful protesters are now part of the Establishment. Some things have changed, but it still remains the same. The prediction about China is now amusing (p.380). Ten years later the Select Congressional Committee re-opened the investigation; they concluded that there were two shooters (refer to pages 356-7), and effectively demolished the shoddy cover-up of the Warren Commission. More books were written because this was no longer a &quot;controversial topic&quot; that was censored by the Establishment. We've also seen other scandals: Watergate, Contra-gate, Iran-gate. The smiling mask on the Establishment wears thin.	2004-07-07

Dr. Luongo is famous of his desires for Truth and Justice.    A young lady inherits shares in a gambling place at Las Vegas. Her father had refused to sell out, and was murdered. Now the daughter is asked to sell her shares to a stranger. She seeks help and advice from Perry Mason. Perry has another client who also owns a part of this gambling place, and begins to investigate. But his client went out of town and can't be found. Perry locates him by telephone, and carries on a secure conversation; the result is that Perry will protect the young heiress. Perry meets the potential buyer to discusses the price, but nothing is resolved. While sitting outside in his car, he sees his client enter this apartment house, and then leave. Then the young heiress enters, and rushes from the house; Perry picks her up and discusses her visit. The next morning the would-be buyer is found murdered in his apartment.    Read this novel to learn why Erle Stanley Gardner was such a popular author; it is a good example of his work. Gardner was a lawyer who found fame and fortune writing about a heroic lawyer roughly based on the life of Earl Rogers. You will learn a few things about law and lawyers as part of this story. Could these tactics be possible today? The fact of blood clotting after a murder is still relevant today. \\"The police rarely solve gangster killings\\" (Chapter 1).

It begins with the travels of Kern Shafter, a loner, to the Dakota Territory of 1875. He joins the U.S. Cavalry as a private, and is quickly promoted to sergeant. (He has a past that is slowly revealed.) Various historical facts are used for background. This story is about a search for happiness, and the obstacles that are overcome. <br />The author describes life in Fort Lincoln during the Indian wars on the Northern Plains. Chapter XIII describes what a journey during a blizzard would be like; Kern survives and meets unexpected visitors. The high point of this novel is Chapters XV through XXI: the ill-fated campaign against the Sioux and Cheyenne at the Little Big Horn river. Kern is wounded, but survives, as a member of Major Reno's command. The book ends with a promise of happiness for Kern. [Relevant to 1943 America?]<br />The reader can learn some facts about this military disaster. General Crook's forces suffered a defeat earlier, and could not continue to advance as part of the plan. Crook telegraphed Sheridan, but no warning was sent to Terry or Custer about the unexpected large force of Sioux and Cheyenne. A carefully planned campaign turned to disaster because of unforseen changes. Later, another campaign using converging columns worked against the Native Americans when there was no overwhelming concentration of these warriors fighting for their homeland.<br />Ernest Haycox was a prolific writer of Westerns, some of these were made into films. This novel concentrates on the common people, which may explain the popularity of Westerns then, and why they were forsaken since the 1950s.	2004-07-02

Faulk has written a very readable and concise history of an army experiment in the 1850s southwest. Victory in the Mexican War resulted in new territories of arid lands, with military presence. Using mules, horses, of oxen to carry men and supplies was difficult and expensive due to the lack of waters in the Great American Desert between the Rockies and the Sierras. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis urged the importation of camels to test their fitness as transportation. Camels could carry 400 to 600 pounds over 25 to 35 miles a day, and could grow fat on plants other animals refused to eat. They could out-perform horses, but not the railroads. The discovery of gold and silver drew people to the desert country; it was also the overland route to lower California and Nevada.<br />The election of James K. Polk resulted in the annexation of Texas, war with Mexico, and the westward expansion of the United States from California to Washington. Discovery of gold and immigration created the state of California. In between was a region that received less than ten inches of rain a year. There were no trees or rivers like the eastern half of the country. These &quot;shortgrass&quot; plains were where the buffalo roamed, and the deer and the antelope played. It was &quot;unfit for cultivation&quot; and &quot;uninhabitable by a people depending upon agriculture&quot; (p.12). The need for transportation brought the idea of using camels, which perform well under desert conditions (pp.19-23). This idea was adopted by a large segment of the population before Congress appropriated funds for this experiment (p.30).<br />The book contains many drawings and photographs that illustrate the topic. The rest of the book tells about the details, but doesn't bog down the reader. The camel has proved its worth for thousands of years. Arabian and Bactrian camels were used by the British in the Crimean War (p.48). But importing a species to a New World will always result in unforeseen problems. The look and smell of camels terrorized horses and cattle. Camels would defend themselves against the maltreatment suffered by mules and horses. Male camels fought during the rutting season, and needed to be separated. Loading camels presented new problems, unlike horses and mules. Done wrong, the load would create sores on their backs. Riding a camel was totally different from horses and mules. Camels had a problem with muddy, swampy ground. Camels could carry a heavier load, and run faster, than horses or mules. Their lesser dependence on water is legendary. The &quot;camel's temper&quot; denoted a vindictive and unforgiving disposition. Camels would feed on shrubs (&quot;greasewood&quot;) avoided by horses and mules. Camels outperformed mules in adverse conditions.<br />The events leading to the Civil War raised new priorities. A new President and Administration had new policies. The Government camels were sold to individuals, who had mixed successes (Chapter 7). The last chapter provides a summary of this new experiment. Camels did well in the hot arid Southwest, mountains, or desert, mud or rocks, and could carry greater weights. But they were never widely accepted. Steam power proved superior to animal power.

Twenty-five years after the war ended many stories were released. This book tells of “Cato’s Orchestra”, a German spy ring that gathered information in Great Britain. Except that it was totally controlled by the British “Twenty Committee” to feed misleading information to the German Abwehr. “Cato” warned the Germans of the invasion of Normandy just before it occurred, then advised them that this was a feint, the real invasion would occur later at Calais.

With popular resentment against secret societies (the Anti-Masonic Party) at its height, William H. Russell created a secret society that was to \\"dominate the world\\" (p.4). This New World Order will eliminate personal freedom for all but a few wealthy families. Skull and Bones has been running the United States for years. Page 5 tells of this feudal society: members get honors and rewards, important jobs and the wealth that goes with it; they must leave part of their estates to this society. Skull and Bones controls Yale's' teachers and publications, its real estate, and most of the land in Connecticut. Skull and Bones follows neo-Nazi doctrines. Their controlling powers are noted on page 7. The author is a member of a kindred secret society, and discusses these legends.<br />Early in the 18th century Yale was started to preserve Congregationalist orthodoxy. It took its name from a wealthy benefactor (East India Company). About half of its graduates became ministers of churches (1702-39). Some of those who protested Yale's orthodoxy went on to found Princeton. Yale, like Harvard, ranked students by social standing, rather than academic standing (p.23). Hazing was part of this class system. These chapters tell a lot about the history of Yale's societies, but I think its just surface details. It does tell how censorship worked (pp.150-1).<br />Chapter 6 deals with the network. George W. Bush has done a great job in distancing himself from his \\"elite Northeastern connections\\" (p.162). Its who you get to know, the talented with great family connections. Every President who attended Yale was a member of Skull and Bones. And so will the next President elected in 2004! The connections involved in passing Bush Sr.'s banking deregulation bill is on page 169. Where did the looted billions wind up? \\"The Network\\" is the most important chapter of this book. [But could you find similarnetworks in most states?] There is the example of loans to Saddam Hussein (p.174). Overall, they seem to be part of a self-selected aristocracy.<br />\\"The Order\\" (Chapter 7) seems similar to one of those small-town clubs formed by people with similar affinities. Except it has both a wider and more limited audience. It also provides a \\"family\\" for those in college. Forming self-selected groups starts in grammar school, but without the formality. The legends about Bonesmen were created to enhance their prestige (p.200). Some of the things that make Yale different from Harvard or Princeton are noted on pages 202-3. Page 205 imagines \\"conspiracy theory\\" as an explanation for the causality for \\"seemingly random events\\". Does Alexandra Robbins deny the reality of \\"underground control\\"? Or is this just a slight attempt at a whitewash? I found it very disappointing and a way to negate the preceding chapter. This book ends with Acknowledgments, a Bibliography, and the Index.

He has observed them all his life. This book tells of his experiences. The Spanish settler on the Gulf Coast called them &quot;el largato&quot; (lizard), and this was changed by English settlers to &quot;alligator&quot;. Chapter 1 provides a physical description of these reptiles, and the enormous power of their jaws. The author contrasts his observations to published information (pp. 20-23). Chapter 2 tells about the habitat of alligators. They dig holes underwater for safety, and to spend the cold winter months. This makes the grass around it greener. Alligators can make trails between water holes, and often travel locally. Alligators mostly feed during warm weather, April to October (Chapter 3). They feed on every living thing they can catch. The extermination of alligators led to a great increase in garfish, muskrats, ducks, water snakes, and turtles. Deer and dogs can be killed when they drink from water; cattle when they walk through marshes. Hogs can not be raised anywhere near alligators.<br />Chapter 4 tells of their rates of growth, and size. Hunting alligators for their hides has destroyed large numbers. New teeth form inside old teeth and replace them (Chapter 5). Full grown alligators have teeth that are almost solid. Chapter 6 describes the limited vocal ability of alligators. Except for man, alligators have no enemies once they grow to about 3 to 4 feet long (Chapter 7). The author explains why they have acute hearing and sight (p.85). Protecting alligators resulted in destroying great numbers of muskrats (p.86).<br />Chapter 8 tells of the variations in size and location of alligator nests. Fully grown females will often use the same location year after year. The author describes his observations of nest building. The flesh of the tail of young alligators is excellent (p.90), resembling meat rather than fish. Chapter 9 describes the incubation and growth of baby alligators. Alligator eggs take about 63 days to hatch, longer in cooler weather. Grass or leaves of other organic matter give off heat as they decompose. Page 113 explains why alligators grow much more rapidly in the wild where the food supply is unlimited. This chapter ends with a plea to protect alligators so their number can be increased to where it was in the late 19th century. [To what end?]	2004-06-05

If you read the book you can understand the film and the changes made from the book. James Bond again works as an enforcer for an Official Monopoly  the Bank of England. They want to eliminate the competition in the sale of gold. Gold is \\"the most valuable and most easily marketable commodity in the world\\", and \\"gold is virtually untraceable\\". \\"Gold attracts the biggest, the most ingenious criminals.\\" You can review the history of imperialism for thousands of years, since Imperial Rome. Bond is to investigate the activities of Goldfinger, as suspect in gold smuggling.    The book begins by telling of as assignment in Mexico to stop the shipment of heroin to England by unofficial means. Arriving in Miami, he meets an American millionaire who wants his advice. Bond finds out why: Junius is losing thousands playing two-handed Canasta. Bond discovers the cheating method, and turns this around; this is his introduction to Goldfinger. [Fleming's detailed observations shows his skills as a former foreign reporter and intelligence agent.] Back in England Bond is assigned to investigate smuggling gold from Britain to India (reversing the effect of 19th century imperialism?). Goldfinger is the suspect; he uses a chain of shops to buy Old Gold (a euphemism for stolen goods?). The problem is to find the method used in smuggling so it can be ended. Goldfinger is also suspected of being a paymaster to Soviet spies, and thus a target for counter-espionage. Bond and Goldfinger play a game of golf. [Fleming shows his skill for details and knowledge of the game and course.] Once again Bond outwits Goldfinger by out-cheating him.    Bond follows Goldfinger to France, and on to Switzerland. There is a complication in \\"Miss Tilly Soames:, and they are caught spying on Goldfinger. Bond offers to work for Goldfinger to save his life and Tilly's too. To further the plot, this offer is accepted! They are flown to New York to be used in Goldfinger's next bold and illegal project, so audacious as to be unthinkable: robbing Fort Knox of its gold! The rest of the book tells how this plot is put into action, and how it fails through the heroic efforts of James Bond. The story continues with Goldfinger's escape from Fort Knox, and his later reappearance in a hijacked airplane. There is a miraculous escape. Oddjob is rejected, Goldfinger no longer needs his millions. Bond survives the crash of a Stratocruiser at sea. And so ends another fantastic story from the mind of Ian Fleming. Was this character inspired by Sir Harry Oakes?    To learn more about Ian Fleming you can read \\"Ian Fleming The Spy Who Came In with the Gold\\" by Henry A. Zeiger. His last chapter tries to explain the popularity of the Bond novels. Perhaps Bond is a heroic figure who can always win against adversity [like The Lone Ranger?]. Does Fleming deliberately and systematically excite and satisfy the worst instincts of his readers? Or does Fleming play to the faults of mankind, who like to read about places and activities that would be strange to their lives? John Le Carre (cover name) says that Bond is a mirror of contemporary maladjustments. Ian Fleming seems like a later version of John Buchan. Fleming's politicization of the enemy recalls the novels of E. Phillips Oppenheim. Note how often the Bond villains are parvenus fighting against the Establishment [a reflection of the sun setting on the British Empire?].	2004-05-14

It uses historical characters in a late 19th century setting to tell its story and educate you about details of times long forgotten. People were much as they are today, but different. You may be entertained as much as by other novels from that long-ago time. The author must have studied many books and newspapers of that time to gather the details needed to create this story. The book explains the politics involved. Custer had testified during the impeachment hearings of Secretary of War Belknap early in 1876. Custer was favored by the Democrats, while Grant was the Republican President. Sherman's brother was an important Republican Senator (Sherman Anti-Trust Act). [Does this remind you of recent events?] Custer would be tried for what he did before he split his command; they had witnesses (p.74). Jones must have searched many old records to recreate the setting for this court-martial on Governor's Island.<br />The crux of the charges are on page 90: Custer did not determine the size and strength of the enemy that morning. [Other books say the Indian warriors would defend against an attack while the women and children escaped, and then would join them. Waiting would let them all escape, so Custer attacked at dawn.] &quot;But all the Sioux had fled&quot; (p.152). While Custer was criticized for engaging the enemy on the 25th, a day earlier than planned, Colonel Gibbon's forces did not arrive until the 27th, a day later (p.156)! Page 175 tells how politicians were paid to appoint a post trader. (Does this still occur today?) Page 185 tells of newspaper rivalry over the trial. Page 191 says the Massacre at Little Big Horn caused Congress to loosen the purse strings. Page 213 tells of the training problems: unfit pack mules, sparse mounts untrained to gunfire, not enough ammunition to train recruits. Custer's forces were to rest that day, and attack the next day. Their discovery by Sioux scouts changed that plan (p.219). The troops would form battalions in line to locate the enemy. The scouts were as far ahead as possible (p.221). Prior to June 17 the Plains Indians did not attempt a pitched battle; it was strike and run (p.223). Nelson Miles would have done the same as Custer (p.225). Custer's talents are summarized in a left-handed way (p.253). Page 262 has Custer's lawyer guessing about the voting.<br />You should be knowledgeable about the events to appreciate this novel. This book lacks a bibliography of sources that could provide an education. While fictional, it explains the events of June 25, 1876 to the general reader. Most of all, it absolves Custer by pointing out that if he did not attack until June 26 (the original plan), then the same result could have occurred since the other troops didn't arrive until June 27, a day late!<br />This book implicitly raises the question: was Custer set up? Did they withhold information on the number of Indians who left the reservation? Custer testified against the corruption of the Grant Administration; did Sherman plan this payback by first putting Custer back in command, then ordering him on a mission known to be extremely risky?	2004-04-29

Both political parties (like a wrestling tag-team) alternate in taxing the many to benefit the super-rich. This recalls the aristocracy of the 18th century Europe who paid no taxes but received the benefits of government. Our tax system subsidizes the rich by taxing everyone else to pay for it (p.2)! Johnston claims that &#34;apathy&#34; causes people to be uninformed about public issues, or don't even vote. Actually the political propaganda in everyday life, like advertising, is designed to create this &#34;apathy&#34;, or fear of questioning authority. The educational system also conditions people to &#34;official history&#34; and credulity.   Page 7 explains the &#34;charitable trust&#34; racket to money-launder assets like stock or buildings to get 96% of your money tax-free! &#34;The U.S. tax code is the most political law in the world&#34; said an expert. Taxation reflects policy; taxing the poor limits their ability to improve their life (p.10). Wage earners have a harsh set of rules unlike business owners. Tax policy since 1981 created the most highly concentrated wealth since 1929. The richest 1% are taxed more lightly than the middle class (p.11). Page 12 explains the &#34;intellectual property&#34; scam to lower taxes. Ever-tougher rules restrict union organizing. New rules allow trusts perpetual life and eliminate the estate tax. &#34;Limited liability&#34; corporations enabled corporate cheating since 1991 (p.13). These issues are under-reported because they're not 'fit to print'. Talk of the top 1% earning 21% of income but paying 37% of taxes is a created statistic like in advertising (p.15); the truth is on page 16. The 1997 reduced tax rate on long-term capital gains is a major tax break for the rich. Originally capital gains were taxed higher than wages on moral grounds (p.17).   The tax scams began in 1983 when Social Security taxes were raised, changing it from pay-as-you-go to create a trust fund to pay benefits over 30 years. But this money was used to pay for tax cuts for the super rich (p.18)! Whether Democrats or Republicans, the tax cuts for the super rich were financed by higher taxes for everyone else. This tax system is creating fewer stable jobs and lesser retirement incomes. Chapters 2 to 20 cover various related topics.   Chapter 21 explains the problem: the richest man in Congress is in charge of the IRS Oversight Subcommittee. He knows of no problems in tax cheating; 'hear no evil, see no evil, hold no hearings' (p.293). The IRS can't investigate rich tax cheats if there's no money in their budget for this! Or if they're forbidden to gather needed data (p.295). Business owners can legally report a lesser income (p.297). The &#34;Contract With America&#34; promised a fairer, simpler tax system, but resulted in 293 major changes (p.299). Johnston tells what is wrong with a national sales tax (p.300), and the &#34;flat tax&#34; (pp.300-309). Is reform possible with the current batch of crooked politicians? Not without an aroused voting populace. Johnston concludes that our tax system needs a complete overhaul (p.305). Taxes have been cut for the rich by raising them on the middle income (higher Social Security taxes than needed, and the alternative minimum tax). Congress needs to pass laws to report all income immediately and pay taxes on it. You can't believe the &#34;courtesans of wealth&#34; on broadcast media (p.306). Most Americans can't save because of their regressive taxes. A society top-heavy with wealth is an unstable society. Page 308 explains the tax burden. The cure is a simplified tax code (pp.312-316). Economic equality creates prosperity; poverty occurs when only the rich have money. What do you want?	2004-04-17

Higham reminds the reader why Lincoln was both loved and hated (p.xv-xvi). There was a lucrative trade in contraband that benefited Lincoln's circle of friends until 1865 when a Congressional investigation changed policy (p.xvii). The failure of Ulric Dahlgren's raid &quot;compelled&quot; the Confederates to start raids and sabotage in northern states. Higham questions the policy of burning cotton to prevent its capture by Union forces (p.8)! England and France hated Lincoln because the Morrill tariff restricted imports. Higham claims Confederate diplomats paid to be captured (p.9)! The Confederate attack from Canada was to provoke a war with England and gain support for the Confederacy (p.10). Page 27 tells how two millionaires bought a magazine to publish their propaganda in 1852. [This still happens and is hidden by corporate fronts.] Higham describes the Young America movement and the Pierce presidency as a group out to foment revolution in other countries (pp.30-31)! The &quot;radical&quot; Nathaniel Hawthorne was appointed consul in Liverpool to spread subversion! Page 38 notes how the wealth of New York bankers and merchants depended on slavery. Higham claims an attempt was made to plant a bomb on Lincoln's railroad car (p.41), based on one uncorroborated report! Why did General Sherman regard reporters as spies? Because they reported Union troop movements (pp.68-69). Lincoln regularly read intercepted telegraphs from subversives.<br />Those who have a good background in the history of the Civil War can best judge this book. It does remind us of the many conspiracies and secret societies long forgotten. In other areas, an investigator who find secret clues overlooked by others often has created them. Lincoln remains the first President killed by a &quot;lone gunman&quot;, but with a complete investigation into the conspiracy. Forty years after JFK's assassination we still have the cover-up and hidden secrets. Was this due to our Imperial Presidency and a weakened Congress and people?<br />Page 83 tells how Lincoln suppressed attempts to expose assassination conspiracies, since it would also discourage Unionists. It is so typical to portray a population as a &quot;silent majority&quot;. McClellan's popularity is explained by putting his men's safety ahead of any victory (p.87). Or maybe he didn't want to risk defeat of the Union after a lost battle? The Union Army was more experienced and equipped afterwards. The harsh prison Camp Douglas is described (pp.88-89). Was there an attempt to kill Lincoln in February 1864 (pp.118-9)? The raid on St. Albans Vermont is described ([pp.128-132), the aftermath on pages 133-5 (money talks). Next we read that Copperheads were planning an assassination, with J. Wilkes Booth present. But this was an anonymous report filed after the fact (p.137)! Can you believe it? Chapter 6 tells of the attempts to burn New York city in 1864; it failed. Page 163 tells how the B&amp;O railroad was used by both sides. Another curious and previously unreported incident of Booth is on pages 186-7. From improved memory? Chapter 7 shows a surprising amount of travel in those horse &amp; buggy days. Higham acts shocked over the trading between the lines, with Lincoln's friends profiting from cotton etc. Doesn't he know that war is about loot, not ideals? Higham ends his book by claiming wealthy Copperheads were behind the murder of President Lincoln (p.244). Given the bulk of evidence showing Booth as a Confederate agent, and killing Lincoln on his own initiative, the historians in academia should treat this book in their journals. Blaming Lincoln for his own death (p.247) seems to deliberately insulting.	2004-04-10

The costs of polluted air are: shortened lives from lung and heart disease, crop damage, etc. The internal combustion engine used by automobiles is the major source. Los Angeles is the pioneer in dangerous air pollution (after it eliminated its trolley system to benefit large landowners, automobile and tire manufacturers, ant the petroleum industry). Donora Penna in October 1948 was an example of this danger from air pollution. England, Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union had similar problems. The worst case was in London during December 1952. But we can't give up heating homes and traveling to work! Internal combustion gives off carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, and lead. [Modern methods have reduced these.] Carbon monoxide has similar effects like pentobarbitol. Pollutants may be responsible for increased lung cancer in non-smokers.<br />Chapter Two said Detroit reacted by ignoring this, then denying it, then saying there was no cure. Crankcase control devices had been used on older cars to improve engine ventilation. Pages 18-19 tell what pollution is generated when idling or decelerating. Steam power has no pollution because its fuel is completely burned and requires no additives. [But manufacturers and bankers have invested in the old technology, and would lose from the introduction of a new technology.] Chapter Three places steam-powered vehicles in historical perspective; this is the most important section of this book. Leon Serpollet developed an early steam automobile with a flash-type generator (no boiler); it could outdrive anything on an 1890s road. For years the fastest car on the road was a Stanley Steamer. The advantages of steam engines are: simplicity of the engine, high torque at low speeds, overload capacity, smooth and flexible speed and power control. ChapterFour discusses the renewed interest in the late 1960s, when the electric car was being considered. Steam power was a better solution. The steam engine is much quieter than an internal combustion engine. It is also more efficient due to lower power losses.<br />Chapter Five tells about the tinkerers in steam cars: underfunded, and using old technology. Bigger firms were interested in steam power for non-automobile use. Chapter Seven reports on California's activity. Large eastern cities had more smog than Los Angeles and San Francisco, but this was suppressed in these regions! California had one of the best staffed legislatures. [But its smog control is contradicted by taxing cars as property, which encourages keeping older, more polluting cars.] Chapter Eight asks if a &quot;free competitive market system&quot; could eliminate pollution without government intervention? Federal legislation was opposed by the automobile and oil industries. Did auto companies develop without government intervention (p.123)? Only if you don't know anything about history!<br />Thirty years later the promise of steam-powered low-emission vehicles lies in the future. Chapter Nine tells of the trial of electrically-powered vehicles. Their technical limitations remain unsolved to this day. Fuel cells were promising, but not cost-efficient  Hybrid power had been tested, but had serious engineering problems. Gas turbines work, but have high cost and fuel consumption. Chapter Ten tries to sum it up. Automobile travel is convenient; we will never go back to traveling by ship, canal, coach, or railroad. These were functional for a society of small, owner-operated businesses. Large corporations required today's transportation system and will prevent any improvements that lessen their powers (pp.146-7).	2004-04-09

Some are well-known, others are not. They are different form the legends created by dramas and fiction. These stories of violence recall the Iliad, the Odyssey, Beowulf, or the Song of Roland; they were the equivalent of broadcast or filmed dramas of today. America was founded by a violent revolution, unlike Europe or Asia where violence occurs without creating new nations. Most of the heroes in this book are anti-establishment, which reflects American character. Most American myths do not have a military origin (p.viii). America's growth came from struggles against other peoples [like Europe in the Dark Ages]; this still occurs throughout today's world. The relatively higher murder rate of America reflects its colonial past; it is lower than in countries south of the Rio Grande (p.x). In fact, the murder rate in Europe is much higher when you include wars, purges, and ethnic cleansing (pp.x-xi). Myths, stories of historical events that reflect popular views, are relatively recent and better documented than the Trojan War. You can compare this book to an uncensored and unexpurgated version of &quot;Grimm's Fairy Tales&quot;.<br />The British plan for winning the war was to have three armies meet: Burgoyne down the Hudson valley, St. Leger down the Mohawk River, Howe up from New York. [This tactic of converging columns was used by General Custer in Montana.] Chapter 2 will teach you a lot about early American history, like Hamilton's scheme to split the Federalist that nearly elected Jefferson (p.22). Burr's exposure of Hamilton's treachery destroyed Hamilton's political career. Page 33 gives more about the treachery among these men. Custer's forces unknowingly attacked &quot;the largest concentration of Indian fighting men ever seen north of the Rio Grande&quot; (p.75). Custer's Last Stand was the heaviest defeat suffered against the Indians, but it was also the last victory of the Indians. Sitting Bull lived toride with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, only to die when &quot;resisting arrest&quot;. Chapter 7 explains the Lincoln County Land War, and Billy the Kid's part in this commercial rivalry. Chapter 8 explains how the Earp gang profited from gambling and drinking in Dodge City before moving to Tombstone Arizona. Most miners and townsmen were northern Republicans, most cattlemen were southern Democrats; each had their criminals. The business of Tombstone was entertainment: saloons, gambling casinos, brothels (their businessmen were called the &quot;Law and Order Party&quot;). Did Wyatt and Morgan tip off the stage robbers (p.117)? Was the Gunfight at the OK Corral meant to eliminate competitors? &quot;Wyatt Earp, Frontier Marshall&quot; may be history by the survivors (p.125).<br />You've heard of the Hatfield-McCoy feud? But what about the conflicts over land rich in timber and coal, or the railroad (Chapter 9)? The 1921 Matewan coal strike occurred nearby. The War on Powder River, Wyoming, won't be found in school textbooks. The millionaire ranch owners conspired with the governor and legislature of Wyoming to take over the state (p.145). The war between the cattle association and the homesteaders is explained (pp.147-8). The cattle owners eliminated competition by putting political enemies on a death list, and hiring an army of gunmen to invade Johnson County. The people of Buffalo were warned, and armed themselves to repel this invasion. The US Cavalry rode in to arrest the invading gunmen. A book published on this crime had every library copy stolen and destroyed (p.155)! In the next election the Republican Party was swept from power in Wyoming. This marked the end of the Old West of cattle barons, and the New West of settled homesteaders. The rest of the book covers twentieth century events.	2004-03-31

Burr was handsome, charismatic, brilliant, and from one of the foremost families of colonial America; a Revolutionary War hero and Lt. Colonel under Washington. Burr was one of the most famous lawyers, Attorney-General of NY, US Senator, and VP to Jefferson. But those that knew him considered him an &quot;unprincipled villain&quot;. This book is an overview of Burr's life and the Conspiracy - an alleged attempt to create a new republic from the western territories of the US. Burr was a genius or hero like Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Marshall, or others. They were all important, and all had their flaws. The best and the brightest are always fallible humans; this book is a reminder (p.236). That is the ever-present reason for checks and balances in government, and a limited term for Chief Executives in state and federal governments. The Charge of Treason against Burr is similar to the conflicts that arose in newly liberated countries in the 20th century. The Trial kept people's attention for nearly a year. Burr was found 'not guilty' but his political career was still ruined.<br />King George's edict banning settlements west of the Appalachians was one of the causes of the Revolution. The population growth of the Americans was as feared as their arms (p.11). The dangerous life of the squatters who preceded the settlers is described on pages 11-12. The Western Waters were hemmed in by the mountains to the east, the lakes in the north, and the Spanish Empire on the south. The latter was the only possible shipping outlet. An earlier conspiracy was exposed; US Senator William Blount was impeached and expelled. Later he became Governor of Tennessee.<br />Part Two traces Burr's rise to power and fame from his skills as a lawyer. Burr the lawyer stayed on good terms with both the Federalist and Republicans; this made him both powerful and loathed (p.32). Burr's strength was his popular support in New York and elsewhere (p.33). But his downfall began when he didn't give way to Jefferson in 1800; this antagonized his strongest ally. Page 63 explains Marshall's strategy in Marbury vs. Madison. After his term as VIce-President ended Burr moved westward. Burr was popular there for slaying Hamilton, their Federalist enemy (p.78). Burr was linked with the Yazoo land swindlers (p.87). General William Eaton learned of Burr's plan to gain the marine corps and naval commanders to overthrow Congress, assassinate the President, and become ruler (p.94). Burr planned to attack both Mexico and the Union. General James Wilkinson saw he could gain more by denouncing Burr, and did so (p.122). If Burr could be silenced Wilkinson would be a hero (p.145).<br />Leading citizens composed the Grand Jury that indicted Burr. When Wilkinson showed up with a letter Burr asked for his arrest for mail theft! This was ruled irrelevant since it happened in another jurisdiction. Burr and others were indicted for treason (p.189). Jury selection was as important then (pp.196-8). The jury found Burr 'not guilty' because the charge wasn't proven (p.216). Also 'not guilty' of violating the Neutrality Act (p.218). His most serious problems were the suits to recover loans (p.219). Burr escaped by fleeing to Europe for years. He returned to New York in 1812 and practiced law, living in obscurity. Burr died in 1836, months after the Battle of San Jacinto (p.233) which seemed to justify his dreams of expansion into the southeast. Perhaps in today's world he would be as famous and successful as other smiley-faced politicians? His lack of any principles suggests this (p.233).	2004-03-31

Raymond P. Briggs is a visual and cognitive scientist. Most of the books on this double murder were written by those who were involved with the trial. This is the first book with an outside and objective viewpoint. It contains the Autopsy Reports (but most would not understand the medical terms). The `Acknowledgments' thank all those who helped. The `Prologue' has a time-line for the events from June 1994 to October 1995. Technology affects political questions (the Zapruder film, the Pentagon Papers, the Watergate Tapes, the Rodney King Videotape).<br /><br />Chapter 1 has the Prosecution's case, their story of the crime. Could a barking dog time an event? [No, dogs can't testify in court.] The Prosecution could not find an expert in the field of spousal abuse to testify for them (p.40). There was no proof that OJ ever owned a pair of Bruno Magli shoes. Witnesses contradicted the time of the murders (p.54). Chapter 2 has the Defense's arguments to challenge the Prosecution and suggest reasonable doubt (p.59). The Defense time-line is on pages 60 to 62. Many fingerprints at the murder scene did not match OJ (p.66). Neither did some blood samples. The Contested Evidence is listed on pages 69 to 72. The EDTA found on the socks and gate suggest evidence planted from the blood sample. The various time-lines are listed on pages 70 to 83, along with their problems. Bot the prosecution and defense claimed the murders occurred at 10:30 to 10:45pm! The limo driver saw no activity at OJ's compound at this time so it provides an alibi (p.85). \\"The gloves didn't fit\\" (p.89), they had Caucasian limb hair inside. The so-called \\"educated and professional classes\\" believed in the shoddy DNA evidence (p.90)! The limo driver's presence provided an alibi for OJ (p.104). If there is \\"something wrong\\" with the Prosecution and Defense scenarios then there must be another explanation (p.109).<br /><br />Chapter 3 discusses alternate scenarios. The Prosecution's claims were not supported by missing evidence (p.110). Was there a \\"second man\\"? There is Unexplained Evidence (pp.127-131). The witnesses near Bundy gave testimony that excluded OJ as the murderer (p.133). Were there two killers (p.138)? Were drugs the cause of the murder (Chapter 4)? Was someone stalking Nicole (p.146)? Was there a threat to Ron (p.149)? Were drugs involved (p.151)? Was organized crime involved (p.166)? Chapter 5 discusses other killers, such as serial killer Glen Rogers (p.175). Were there two killers (p.177)? The failure to call the coroner prevented a better estimate of time of death (p.189). Chapter 6 discusses Mark Fuhrman's history. He found a moist-looking bloody glove at 6:06am (p.211) and had other activities (p.212). How did that one glove go from the murder scene to OJ's house? How did blood get into the Bronco (p.217)? [That Sherlock Holmes' case is \\"Silver Blaze\\" (p.219).] There is a short definition of the Black Dahlia Murder Case (p.222). The Singular manuscript contained information that could destroy the Prosecution's case (p.226). Chapter 7 says OJ was warned to \\"take Nicole and the children away\\" earlier (p.231). There are unanswered questions (p.232). What if Ron Goldman was the target and Nicole the innocent bystander (p.248)?<br /><br />The Appendices cover ten subjects. The time-lines assume the murders occurred between 10pm and 11pm. This is not true. The blood of the victims would have been black and clotted when the bodies were found by the police at 12:15am. The red liquid blood suggests the murders took place about 11:30 to 11:40pm. A passing couple saw Nicole's body at 11:45. [The book \\"Forty Whacks\\" can tell you this, its about an older double murder.] Ron's height, weight, and age made him resemble Nicole's boy friend, another possible target. Keith went into hiding for months afterwards and was never questioned by the police or at the trial.	2004-03-30
730788:US	38002140	RZYT7NMXH68VZ	0792263626	96389309	Ghosts of Tsavo: Tracking the Mythic Lions of East Africa	Books	4	3	9	N	N	The Outlaw Lions	&quot;Tsavo&quot; means &quot;place of slaughter&quot; - the lions there are abnormally large, have maneless males, and are historically known as man-eaters. In 1898 two rogue lions terrorized a railway construction project; these lions were called &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Darkness&quot; and inspired a 1996 film about this event. The Tsavo district is in south Kenya adjacent to Tanzania. This pair of lions would sneak into the construction camp at night, snatch up men from their tents and consume them within hearing distance. The engineer in charge, Lt. Col. John Henry Patterson, was an experienced tiger hunter but was often outwitted by these beasts. The contract laborers from India came to regard them as body-snatching demons. Eventually Patterson shot one lion from a platform. He trailed the second after wounding it (pp.7-8). A century later another man-eating lion appeared (pp.9-21). Note how this implies another form of colonial oppression: the people cannot keep and bear arms. A dozen 12 gauge shotguns could eliminate these wild beasts.<br />There are other beasts preying on Kenya today (p.33). Muggings, murders, and carjackings are so common that tourism is declining. This is matched by other sub-Sahara African countries. White colonials are safe in their fortresses, like medieval aristocracy (p.34). Tsavo lions are genetically different from common lions. They may be descended from maneless cave lions of the Pleistocene period. Their massive size matches their prey: the large, strong Cape buffalo (p.44). Theory says a crippling wound causes a lion to turn man-eater; the other reason is a loss of natural prey due to disease or over-hunting (p.46). Or they were taught from preying on abandoned bodies! Most man-eaters killed were in good or fair condition (p.47). Page 47 tells how a lion was killed with a knife!<br />Much of the fossil evidence of early human evolution comes from the bones left by large feline predators. It still happens to bicycle riders and drinkers at pubs (p.132). Predators look for a sign of weakness or injury. Page 256 tells how to hunt a lion. Find a carcass, then track the lion to where it was sleeping. Kill it before it awakes. Males with large, dark manes are preferred by females (p.251). Two myths about man-eaters are disproved on page 266. Man-eaters are not old or injured, or can't catch &quot;normal&quot; prey. Primates, like humans, are the normal prey of big cats for thousands of years. 7,000 people were killed in India by tigers in the mid-1920s. 1,500 humans were killed in southern Tanzania between 1932 and 1947 (p.267). Lions use their strong jaws and powerful limbs to kill. They pull an animal down and break its neck or clamp down on its muzzle to suffocate it (p.268). An area free of wild prey can create man-eating lions, particularly if the colonial rulers ban firearms to the people. Burial practices left dead bodies above ground, which attracted predators and trained them as man-eaters. Epidemics and famine added to the human food supply (p.292).	2004-03-26

Since dramatizations are always more popular that dull reality, this work is never ending. The author says that Americans know plenty of history, but little of it is true. No facts are cited, so page 11 serves as an ironic introduction. Seventeen chapters group historical topics. They make entertaining reading, and are informative. But are they all 100% correct? Note how many of his notes reference a sole source. Page 22 questions Eli Whitney's use of interchangeable parts from inspecting surviving examples. But after decades of wear wouldn't the original parts have been replaced? The Ford assembly line (p.25) came from Chicago slaughterhouses.<br />The \\"Founding Fathers\\" chapter teaches you what is censored from the schoolbooks. Page 31 tells of the Yazoo land swindle in Georgia, and the part played by the US Supreme Court after the fact. Neither Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, or Hamilton went to church regularly (p.35). \\"Presidents\\" says that Warren Harding was selected after many ballots. His Cabinet included some of the best minds in the country (p.50). If not the brightest, he made it up by often working from 8am to midnight until he died of a heart attack. Eisenhower's \\"fuzzy locutions\\" were just a way to give evasive answers (p.54). Reagan was a liberal Democrat from the 1930s to the early 1950s (pp.56-57). Most Presidents had a middle-class to rich background, except Andrew Johnson [and Bill Clinton?] (pp.58-59). Shenkman contradicts de Tocqueville on the \\"equality of conditions\\" in America. But de Tocqueville was right; lavish living was politically incorrect, and considered immoral. De Tocqueville also commented on America's fascination with money.<br />\\"Sex\\" suggest the only diference from 200 years ago is more publicity. The sermons against vice in the late 19th century may have been against the industrialized version (p.71). Big cities had guidebooks so \\"the reader may know how to avoid them\\" (p.72)! \\"The Family\\" notes the high rate of divorce in America started in the 1880s (p.80). Divorce seems to follow the economy (p.81). In past centuries early death was so common that single parent families were prevalent (p.82). \\"War\\" suggestss a censored reign of terror during the Revolution; a higher proportion of Loyalists fled than Royalists from Revolutionary France (p.84), where more died. Shenkman says the Mexican War was for territory, as if this was unusual (p.91)! Like most historical arguments, one man's truth is another man's myth. Page 103 says the Japanese emperor and the Supreme Council decided to end the war on June 20, 1945 weeks before the A-bombs were dropped. No one expected deaths from the radiation!<br />The popular image of \\"The Frontier\\" as a place of violence is due to Hollywood movies and dime novels, rather than historical fact (p.112). The Kansan cow towns which saw more violence were those with a large transient male population looking for fun. Davy Crocket's legend came from his political biographies (p.114). \\"Education\\" notes the failures in schooling goes way back; it is not a current phenomenon (p.13). College rebellions were common in the early 19th century (pp.135-6). \\"The Good Old Days\\" refer to the times where problems were forgotten and good memories retained (pp.159-160). Drug abuse was widespread in the late 19th century, not counting alcohol (p.164). \\"Folklore\\" says many famous figures believed to be mythical were based on real people, like Johnny Appleseed (p.166).

The 18 chapters consist of examples and explanations on the subject of firearms safety while hunting. There are slightly over 1.0 fatal hunting accidents for every 100,000 licenses issues. Swimming and boating are typically twice as dangerous (p.10). Hunter education programs have helped to reduce accidents. Chapter 18 lists their addresses for every state and Canadian province. Virtually all accidents fit into 21 categories, some types occur more frequently (p.9). About half involve firing intentionally but not hitting the target. About one-third involve self-inflicted wounds. Never grasp a firearm so the muzzle points at you! Accidents are mostly caused by carelessness, ignorance, or a lack of skill. Most accident victims are friends or family members. <br />Chapter 4 lists the safety rules for firearms and ammunition. It shows the distances that a shotgun or rifle can hit beyond a target. Accidents from careless handling typically occur among the young and those over 55; a lack of skill, or fatigue. Many accidents occur in and around vehicles. Chapter 7 suggests safe carrying examples, and when each should not be used. It warns against firing outside the safe zone for different activities. Hunting is no more complicated than driving a car (p.49). <br />Chapter 9 tells of the illusion of &quot;early blur&quot;, where an observer may see what he expects to see when details are fuzzy. This is a physiological phenomenon that must be avoided. The use of fluorescent orange clothing has reduced the number of hunting accidents. The rules for each state and province are listed. Chapter 10 cautions against line-of-fire accidents, where a shot hits something other than the target. These mostly violate the well-known &quot;don't assume&quot; rule.<br />Chapter 11 lists the special considerations for hunting turkey and waterfowl. Turkey hunters who call birds to where they sit are often victims of shootings. Boating when hunting is dangerous because of unstable boats and hypothermia (cold water). Chapter 12 warns about the use of alcohol which depresses brain functions like balance and coordination. Chapter 13 has the rules for muzzle-loading safety. Chapter 14 explains why accidents don't occur at trap and skeet clubs. Chapter 15 explains the importance of eye and ear protection. Loud noises damage your hearing. Chapter 17 lists items for firearms safety in the home. This book should be placed in every school library.	2004-03-22

He rose, and fell, by being a willing servant. Dean's office was the center of Nixon's intelligence operation (lawyers have client confidentiality). His story was recreated from documents and taped conversations. Dean was working for the Justice Dept. when he was asked about working at the White House by Bud Krogh. John Mitchell advised him that the WH &quot;was not a healthy place&quot; (p.12). (Was this relatively young lawyer recruited to be a future fall guy?) The expenses for the San Clemente complex had been safely buried in inconspicuous budgets (p.16). Dean joined the WH, and soon learned &quot;to keep my mouth shut&quot; (p.23). Dean learned how interior decorating kept political scores (pp.29-30)! He also learned how to move upwards in influence by traveling downward through power plays, corruption, and outright crimes (p.30). Just as he made it to the top, he actually touched bottom.<br />Dean's education began when he read the &quot;Huston Plan&quot;, which removed most legal restraints on wiretaps, mail intercepts, and burglaries. J. Edgar hoover vetoed the plan - the risk was greater than the reward (or turf protection?). More mundane matters are listed on pages 39-40. Page 45 tells of his first liability over a burglary. Page 51 tells how Erlichman won his power struggle against Mitchell. The Dita Beard letter is discussed on pages 53-59. J. Edgar Hoover said it was genuine, another action that infuriated the Nixon WH. The next liability was hiding the Town House Operation (pp.59-62). By May 1972 the ITT scandal ended and Kleindienst was confirmed; it looked like the end of the problems. Chapter 3 tells of the Howard Hughes affair. No mention of the Wallace shooting at all; Wallace's removal from the campaign allowed Nixon to win in a landslide. Dean tells the details of political intelligence for Nixon.<br />Chapter 4 begins with theburglary at the Watergate. Dean was called for advice, and told to investigate the &quot;plumbers&quot;. The most important thing in all this is the friction and conflict among Nixon's men (pp.94-95). When Dean met Liddy they went for a walk outside; was this to avoid bugs (p.96)? If Strachan knew, Haldeman knew, and so did Nixon (p.98). It went up to the top of the chain. Next Strachan came to confess to Dean that he purged Haldeman's files (p.100). Then Sloan called to confess giving &quot;large bundles of cash&quot; to Liddy. Colson disavowed any knowledge or responsibility for Hunt. But Hunt was still on the WH payroll and had an office there (p.103). Page 121 summarizes the problems in defending the Administration, and how Dean hid evidence by turning it over to the FBI (p.122). He then crossed the line into criminal culpability. Dean's personal rapport allowed him access to the warring factions (p.125); but this sucked him into the conspiracy.<br />Chapter 5 tells of his new powers: one of the top people, meeting many new women (p.127). The Press ignored the scandal. Dean was &quot;stunned&quot; by Nixon's &quot;bold lies&quot; at a press conference (p.128). Dean was dazed by Nixon's claims (p.129). Later he began to suspect being set up as a fall guy (p.131). Note how a few pawns were sacrificed to save the king (p.133). Page 136 tells about assigning a case to an Nixon appointed judge! Dean's description of Nixon on page 138 suggests a personal problem. Page 143 explains Nixon's concern for civil liberties, and campaign contributions. Page 148 tells of the massive purge planned by Nixon; &quot;he'll regret this&quot; (p.149). Did this plan amount to a power grab? Stans explained his fund raising: wealthy targets owed a fixed percentage of their income (p.158). When Dean looks up &quot;obstruction of justice&quot; he realizes they're all guilty (p.168)! Hunt's missing notebooks were destroyed by Pat Gray (p.171). Then they hear from McCord: &quot;it will bea scorched desert&quot; (p.177). Dean destroyed evidence (p.182). Do you see where this is heading? Dean wrote a very readable book.	2004-03-13

It treats the Justices as men motivated by their political beliefs and personal backgrounds. The Court has always been a political body, not disinterested seekers after &#34;Truth&#34;. Their life-time tenure often reflects obsolete beliefs and politics that were outdated when they made decisions. The Supreme Court is the most powerful and secretive branch of Government; they are not responsible to anyone or anything. There are no checks and balances on the Supreme Court. This is why past decisions can be overruled, or plain language can be interpreted contrarily. The Court is irresponsible since it can even duck a decision on any issue. They are not required to explain why they refuse a case (p.16). But an important issue does not go away if it is ignored.  There is a need for autocratic power in defending the civil liberties of people from state power (p.22). But the Supreme Court has been most reluctant to do this (p.23). Most Supreme Court cases cover financial matters (p.25). The Supreme Court hides its politics behind a symbolic sacredness that the author compares to British Royalty (p.27). New Justices don't turn over a new leaf (p.30). Any attempt to evaluate the Court's activities must analyze the persons who create these decisions (p.31). The reasons for judicial decisions are often excuses for what they want to do. They are unique for making authoritarian decisions within a constitutional democracy. [Some of the examples cited became obsolete during the Warren Court: &#34;one man, one vote&#34;, the Miranda decision, etc. Did the publication of this book play a part?]  Chapter 2 discusses the origins of the Supreme Court. It has been both agent and exerciser of political power from the beginning. Judicial review allows a veto of any national or state law - a tyranny unknown in any other country (p.35). Interpreting laws makes them so powerful. Page 37 tells of a Supreme Court decisionso incorrect as to be absurd; the very next day Congress passed a reworded stature. &#34;Judicial Review&#34; was created by the first Supreme Court, a royal prerogative (pp.38-39). Judicial review was not wanted by the Founding Fathers (pp.40-41). [Was the Wizard of Oz a symbol for the Supreme Court?]  The Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the six Justices the power to decide the validity of any state or Federal law (p.43). Rodell explains this as a way to extend Federalist control way into the future (p.45). [The senility of William Cushing proved the need for a limited term from the beginning.] Judicial review was first exercised in 1792 when they declined to act in awarding pensions to Revolutionary War veterans (p.52). When the Court allowed a citizen to sue a state in federal court, the reaction was the passage of the Eleventh Amendment (p.55). Pages 57-58 discuss the lack of &#34;advisory opinions&#34;. [But it means the Court will wait to see how things work out before making a decision.] Pages 64-66 tell of the Sedition Act, when the Courts acted as enforcers for the Federalist Party. Could this happen again? The last act of the Federalists was to create new federal circuit courts and Judges, and to appoint John Marshall of Virginia as the new Chief Justice. The rest of this book covers the next 150 years in 260 pages.  Judicial principles are merely words to camouflage grabs for power by one class against another (p.119). Blessing crooked land deals goes back to John Marshall (p.101). Lincoln said &#34;their power is the more dangerous as they are in office for life, and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to elective controls&#34; (p.134). When will the people reform SCOTUS?	2004-03-09

She is the head nurse in charge of one floor. It recounts her experiences and her personal life. I wonder what she would now say thirty years later? TV dramas show intense activity; they skip the mundane daily events. &quot;Drama is real life without the dull spots.&quot; This nurse often talks about death and dying; that seems like a sign of unhappiness or depression. Happy people never think about dying; the very idea is obscene, like asking someone if they've been dewormed lately. (An unfrisky puppy may suffer from this ailment.)<br />This book concentrates on those with incurable illnesses, or with illnesses from poor eating (diabetes). I once read a claim that diabetes is unknown among those who do not eat refined foods. (That may be true, but they may suffer from other illnesses.) But diabetes was described in the time of Hippocrates; it may be as old as civilization. Those who die of TB or cholera at 30 will never live long enough to suffer from diabetes, heart disease, or cancer. You just can't win! The book mentions the problems of untreated diabetes and other illnesses. Is this a plea for National Health Care? I think NHC should be available for all until age 19. We can't guarantee proper eating, healthy living, etc. The pursuit of happiness may not always be a healthful activity.	2004-03-04

This overlooks his importance as Attorney-General and Secretary of the Treasury for Andrew Jackson. This very readable book coves the events of his life. Taney studied law, and married the sister of Francis Scott Key. He first ran for office as a Federalist; the War of 1812 made him support Madison. Taney's direct appeal to the people on election matters showed him as a Jackson Democrat. Taney was extraordinary as a lawyer, he worked with meticulous care. He also took unpopular and losing causes: he defended General James Wilkinson, the Rev. Jacob Gruber against instigating slaves to rebellion, and Solomon Etting against the Bank of the United States. Taney was appointed Attorney-General of Maryland by the Federalist Governor. He supported the railroad against the canal in a famous court case (p.109-112).<br />Andrew Jackson appointed Taney as Attorney-General. The Bank War was one of the most important events. The Second Bank could operate anywhere in the nation, and was the depository for Government funds. If the Bank couldn't be regulated for the greatest good, it would have to be killed. A sound currency does not come from a bank, but from Government acceptance of their notes (p.152). Jackson vetoed the Bank's renewal as it was dangerous to the liberties of the people (p.162). The Bank struck back by contracting the money supply to harm business in selected states; it also violated its Charter by purchasing public debt (p.171). Taney was appointed Secretary of the Treasury to deposit new revenues in selected State Banks. The Bank retaliated by draining specie from circulation, reducing loans, and withdrawing capital from the West. This turned other banks and the business community against them (p.189). When the Bank changed its policy, it proved they had too much power! The election of 1834 saw the defeat of many of Jackson's enemies.<br />Taney was appointed Chief Justice, and settled outstanding cases.The Charles River Bridge case was a symbol of a monopoly against the people; it held that a legislature could not bind their successors, as this would forbid progress, prosperity, and happiness. Taney's decision allowed one state corporation to operate nationwide, but subject to each state's regulations; a corporation was treated as a citizen. Taney sought to keep the Court out of party controversies; \\"judicial self-restraint\\" was to leave maximum freedom to Government agencies.<br />The Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Each state would decide to ban or allow slavery. This caused the rise of Abolitionism; opinions were inflamed and hardened. The North regarded slavery as immoral (freeholding farmers), the South as sanctioned by law and custom (large landowners). Taney's decision on Dred Scott blotched his reputation, and really didn't resolve the political question. This case was created to force a judicial decision (p.382-6). [This case is the perfect argument for mandatory retirement at 72.] This decision became controversial in the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Lincoln said that letting the Supreme Court decide meant people were no longer free to rule themselves.<br />Taney protested President Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus. Ex Parte Milligan settled this issue afterwards. Pages 460-1 tell how Taney disposed of an entrapment case. Lincoln is regarded as a great democrat, the exponent of government by the people, the savior of the Union. But no other President had used executive orders and the powers of proclamation (p.464). [Can you make an omelet without breaking eggs?] Taney's failing health made his death no surprise. Taney's decision, which he hoped would benefit the nation, did nothing.	2004-03-03

Hans specialized in flying captured Allied aircraft that fell intact into German hands. He had no flight manuals and had to fly by intuition; he never crashed or seriously damaged one airplane. This book is based on his wartime records, and tells of his test results. In 1974 a captured Dornier Do335 was sent back to Germany. This led to writing a book about his experiences, illustrated with many photographs.<br /><br />One story was about flying a captured Lancaster bomber at night so it could be tracked by German radar equipment. Their radio failed, and they tried to find a landing field. They were immediately enemy suspects! Hans explained the problems in an unknown aircraft (pp.12-14). Page 20 tells of the troubles with reverse operating instruments. Hans was part of an air to air refueling test (p.21). \\"Most accidents were the result of a combination of several faults appearing simultaneously.\\" Controls were arranged differently in every aircraft; many test flights of captured aircraft ended in crash landings (p.23). Only one kind of aircraft can be optimized for a given purpose. A fast plane should not tow slower gliders (p.27). Prone piloting allowed higher 'g' forces, but it was more difficult to judge the position of the aircraft (p.28).<br /><br />The main advantage of the B-17 was their turbo-charged engines. Germany lacked heat-resistant metals to build these, and German synthetic oil was of a lower quality. The B-26 was a quite passable aircraft but had to be handled with great sensitivity. Italian aircraft, just like the French, developed full power when the throttles were pulled back, unlike German design. This would sometimes create bad accidents for the unwary! Using a higher viscosity oil at low temperature could create problems in landing flaps (p.51).<br /><br />The first airworthy B-24 was captured in 1943, and flown to Germany to investigate this high performance aircraft. Its relatively smaller wing had higher wing loading, a faster take-off and landing speed. Its center of gravity was too far back. The nose wheel was weak, so the B-24 was restricted to concrete runways. Page 61 discusses the trade-offs in B-24 loading; it was not an easy airplane to fly. Page 63 discusses the differences between a manually controlled B-24 and an automatically controlled airplane. The chapter \\"My flying background\\" is a short autobiography of his life in the 1930s.<br /><br />The P-47's strong points were not in dogfighting or heights under 6000m. It excelled in higher altitudes, diving attacks, and long-range bomber escort. Later water-injection improved it for lower altitudes. The P-51 had an excellent Packard-built Rolls Royce Merlin engine. Its performance characteristics were very good; it had excellent aerodynamic properties. The Soviet La-5 was a very serious opponent below 3000m. The Yak-3 performed well up to about 3500m. It had plywood wing surfaces, light weight, and low wing loading. Compressed air, rather than hydraulics, operated brakes, undercarriage, flaps, and radiator grills (soap suds could detect a leak). The plywood wing allowed an easy repair on the front lines (p.125). The Hawker Tempest was a very fast aircraft said to be used to shoot down or intercept V-1 flying bombs. The Me262 jet fighter was faster than piston-engined fighters, but was shot down by Mustangs, Thunderbolts, or Tempests; page 129 explains why. The book ends with his last flight in a Dornier 335, the fastest piston-engined airplane. The book contains no index or listing of photographs. Lerche seems to be an ace technician, or trouble-shooter, who concentrated on his job. This book does not have a wide appeal to the general audience.	2004-03-01

It touches on the significant events of his life. Andrew's father died before he was born. He and his older brothers fought in the Revolution; his older brothers died. Andrew's mother died while caring for prisoners (cholera). The orphan lived with an uncle, tried teaching school, then studied law and was admitted to the bar. When a friend became Judge, Andrew was appointed Prosecutor. Legal fees let him become a large landowner. He met Rachel, the youngest daughter of the Donelsons, one of the most important families in the territory. When Tennessee became a state in 1796, Jackson was elected to Congress, then the Senate. Jackson was appointed Major-General when the War of 1812 began, and was sent to New Orleans. Jackson did not want the help of the local pirates, but the leading businessmen pleaded for their inclusion (experienced artillery). Jackson accepted the support of free men of color. The Battle of New Orleans was an overwhelming victory for America! The excellent marksmanship of American soldiers (\\"a well-regulated militia\\"), and Jackson's luck, helped. Jackson showed his high-handed ways by arresting a Federal judge for issuing a writ of habeas corpus to free a local legislator who wrote a newspaper article!<br />Jackson was appointed Governor of newly acquired Florida. He was incensed by the attempts of the rich and powerful to trample on the rights of the poor and weak (p.89). His policies proved practical and worthwhile; his popularity and political connections made him a likely presidential candidate. But popularity meant little to those who controlled the government. Jackson's well-organized, well-financed, and well-directed campaign was revolutionary. A Central Committee corresponded with other committees around the country, a cadre of Congressmen caucused on strategy. Jackson took positions to straddle the differences among his supporters. This group became the Democratic party, and had rallies, parades, barbecues, dinners. His election was considered the end of government by the large landowners and commercial aristocracy! The Eaton affair caused problems. Jackson was the first strong executive acting to benefit all the people.<br />The two big problems were the Tariff and Nullification. They were ended by the Compromise Tariff. Jackson then toured the country to popular applause. He was the first President to use the veto for political reasons. Jackson rallied the people for their support, appealed to the public interest. His biggest achievement was the destruction of the Second Bank of the United States, which centralized political and economic power under private control, and was an unregulated monopoly with special privileges. This Bank was resented by state bankers, freeholding farmers, urban wage earners, lawyers, small planters, merchants, and manufacturers. Jackson vetoed its charter renewal. \\"There are no necessary evils in government. Its evils exist only in its abuses.\\"<br />The Anti-Masonic Party, the first third party in American history, opposed both Jackson and Henry Clay. Jackson won through party organization. He shuffled his Cabinet, then ordered future government deposits to selected state banks. The Bank curtailed loans and created an economic panic. Some Democrats with National Republicans and others formed the Whig Party. Jackson believed he represented the people against aristocracy and privilege. This doctrine of equality was followed by a wide assortment of reform groups: public education, abolishing debtor's prisons, women's rights, care for the poor, world peace, temperance, improved prisons and insane asylums, and the abolition of slavery. If he did not agree with them, Jackson set these forces into motion by his examples (the first Liberal Democrat?). Jackson was the first to suffer an assassination attempt (a lone gunman). He made Roger Taney Chief Justice (who upheld the right of popular legislators to regulate corporations and property rights). This struck down monopolies and aided the rapid development of industry. Jackson eliminated the national debt through tariffs and land sales. To prevent buying public lands with any kind of paper money, the Specie Circular was passed. The collapse of this speculative bubble was followed by a depression. The Treasury surplus was solved by \\"depositing\\" excess funds to state governments (the first tax rebate?). Jackson's Farewell Address warned against the increasing danger of sectionalism, an that eternal vigilance by the people is the price of liberty.t of popular legislators to regulate corporations and property rights).

Shooting supplanted hawking as a means of providing game birds for the table. Farming plantations reduced the area available for this sport: fewer game birds. Hawking requires open country with few hedges or trees, refuges for birds. Falconry was the chief sport of the aristocracy until the 17th century (p.11).<br />Hawks are divided into two variants: true falcons (long-winged hawks), and true hawks (short-winged hawks). Falcons are at home in the open country, hawks at woody areas. Hoods are used to control a hawk that would otherwise be so nervous and excitable as to become exhausted. Hooded, it can be carried for miles through streets and railways. There are technical terms used in hawkings (pp.25-27).<br />The training of hawks on dead and then live birds is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. A dog is used to flush game birds from cover. When one bird in a flock is killed, the rest find a refuge. They will soon be out again, for there is nothing unnatural in being frightened by a hawk; they readily learn to avoid them. Birds learn to take to any ditch to avoid a hawk. Setters are more suited to hawking than pointers. More game birds are taken by shooting. A passage hawk is preferable to a nestling, being stronger and gentler. But eyesses are easier to train. Falcons and other raptors follow the flocks of migrating birds. Pages 55-58 describe the capture of passage hawks; pages 60-64 describe their training.<br />The book implicitly describes the labor-intensive training of falcons and hawks. Shooting is less labor-intensive and more cost-effective in gathering game birds for the table. It also requires less open country. There are also the increased demands upon time since the 19th century. Falconry has become almost as obsolete as a scythe for cutting grasses. Providing habitats for wild hawks and falcons in suburban areas is one way to lessen the vermin in these areas.<br />Chapter VI tells of those who renewed interest in this &quot;sport of kings&quot; during the 19th century. Sportsmen who take up hawking rarely abandon it, although the land area needed prevents its general popularity. Chapter VII describes the housing for falcons, their care and treatment, and general hints. The intensive hand labor and care is remarkable. The book tells how to repair broken feathers by 'imping' and 'sewing in'. 'Coping' is the shortening of beak and claws. Hawks appear to suffer from as many and complex diseases as humans.<br />This 1971 edition is a reprint of the British 1892 edition.br />Chapter VI tells of those who renewed interest in this &quot;sport of kings&quot; during the 19th century.

The power of communication attracts \\"hackers\\" who seek to arrogate this power for their personal satisfaction. One example is Kevin Poulsen, who really learned how the system worked. Wiretaps are the secret weapon of the FBI, used to ensnare gangsters, and to control Presidents and political enemies (the function of every secret police). In describing Kevin's phone tapping, the author also tells quite a bit about the wiretapping of politically-oriented individuals by Federal agencies. This is not an innocent game (see COINTELPRO). Pages 183-186 tell how \\"facts\\" are presented to a Grand Jury to get an indictment. Dante's \\"Inferno\\" is a trip to the lowest depths of hell. Kevin starts out innocently (?), then travels downward from free calls, wiretapping, contest scams, aiding prostitution, finally looking into wire transfers of funds to the Cayman Islands. Didn't Kevin see what was happening?    In November 1989 an LAPD detective got a tip on illegal phone use (p.198). He and PAC BELL investigators went through hundreds of pages of \\"Escort\\" ads in the LA phone books to find the lines that had no billing statements, but worked. The phone company accepted ads (cash up front), then terminated service upon police complaint. They first sought a dishonest PAC BELL employee, not a hacker. Eventually someone talked and named the person who could arrange this. Then the trap was baited and they hooked a lead.    Page 174 tells how Kevin's \\"oil-leaking clunker\\" died on the highway. Cars over 7 years old often need new oil pan gaskets; its cheaper than another car. Was it a coincidence that Poulsen, Gilligan, and Lottor were indicted after the AT&T long distance network crashed on 01-15-1990 (p.209)? As a scapegoat for system nonfeasance? Kevin's crew seemed to assume that since they were never caught they never would be (pp.230-9). I wonder if General Custer felt the same way on that Sunday in June 1876?    Perhaps Kevin's biggest crime was getting caught so the powers he used were exposed to public scrutiny (the Digital Telephony Act of 1994 on page 280). The telephone companies can wiretap anyone's phone call without court authorization (p.281). I suspect this allows \\"plausible denial\\" for Government agencies. This surveillance can be done without any Congressional funding or oversight.    Page 250 tells of the personal calls made to the police searching for Kevin, and their threats. This made the police more committed to Kevin's capture. The food supply for Kevin's hide-out had no fresh vegetables or fruit (p.251)! This book lacks an index, but is very readable.	2004-02-19
786792:US	38002140	R1G2X8SNGEE2S2	0877491569	526264947	In the footsteps of Sherlock Holmes	Books	3	12	14	N	N	Researching the Locations of those Stories	This book describes London as it existed during the late 19th century, when the Sherlock Holmes stories were written. Since fiction is based on facts, Harrison sought to find the real locations described in the stories. He also compared the stories to some of the scandals and crimes of that era. The names of places were usually changed into fictional places. The old towns of England are often separated by 7 to 9 miles (an hour by horse), the villages by 2.5 to 3 miles (an hour's walk). Harrison explains the reasoning for picking particular sites. &quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot;<br />Why was London dependent on horse-drawn vehicles? The railway investors limited automobiles (steam-driven) to prevent ruinous competition (p.48). 1879 saw electric light bulbs in use. London consumed a large amount of porter, which had double the alcohol and a higher infusion of hops - a narcotic (p.50). The insufficient drainage created mud from horse-droppings whenever it rained. Fresh air was mostly found in the country.<br />Baker Street was originally developed as high-class residential; it had changed to upper middle-class residential and commercial by 1881 when inhabited by Holmes &amp; Watson. It was close to rail and bus routes (pp.82-83). Many of London's suburbs had their origins in villages built by wells (p.121). Their houses were built along existing transportation routes, avoiding the hilly parts before electrified trolleys. The &quot;Bobby&quot; patrolled upper-class neighborhoods, leaving the middle-class to deal with the &quot;roughs&quot; (p.131). A &quot;decent&quot; person wasn't safe outside their own territory. A person's dress proclaimed their social rank. Walking sticks, weighted with lead, were often used as weapons to fend off attacks. A lady could hire a porter to carry a bag and be assured of protection in the street.<br />Sherlock Holmes' restlessness, working without sleep or rest, changes of mode, and collapsing into somnolence are all signs of cocaine use (p.155). This and other chemicals could be as easily purchased as aspirin today. Harrison identifies the location of &quot;Stoke Moran&quot; (p.159). He does not offer a diagnosis for the &quot;mad violence&quot; of Roylott's temper (p.163). Could it be a brain disease?<br />As a background to &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; Harrison discusses the 1878 Congress of Berlin, which avoided a general European war by agreeing to &quot;the spheres of influence&quot; which divided up the world that was not already colonized. Page 206 discusses the alliances of that time which were a forerunner to the Great War. Writing in the 1950s, Harrison describes the places that were little changed from the 1890s. Page 7 shows the older fashion for writing the digit '8' (like a capital 'S').	2004-02-13

The legal team defending the cigarette manufacturer hasn't lost any previous suits. They use a company that investigates jurors in depth, watches them closely, and advises the lawyers. Both sides do this, but not to the same extent. There was talk about illegal means, but nobody was ever caught. This book gives a lot of background information on the Judicial System that you won't see in newspapers or television. A young woman sends inside information to the man in charge of jury investigation for the tobacco company. [One tip-off to an undercover agent like Easter is his prior experience and attempts to gain leadership.] The testimony tells of the carcinogens and other compounds in tobacco smoke. Nicotine is a poison that raises blood pressure, increases the pulse rate, and is addictive. [Comparable to other human activity?] Chapters Nine and Twelve tell how a juror can be influenced by corporate powers. Easter tells the jury he was followed, and suggests the others were (to create fear and hatred?).   Chapter 15 explains the Big Money paid into political lobbying to restrict insurance company awards in damage suits. [Is this happening in your state?] Page 140 tells how insurance companies control physicians. A retired company executive testified about the need for nicotine because of its addictive qualities (p.155). Cigarettes are promoted in advertising (to create &#34;peer pressure&#34;), but when a smoker dies from lung cancer the tobacco company blames the victim!   Chapter 18 tells how new developments are carefully considered by county supervisors. This story about the real estate salesman sounds like it came from the &#34;Mission Impossible&#34; television series. Chapter 29 tells how one juror is bounced for reading newspapers and magazines (did they check for fingerprints?) [Another tip-off to an agent is his skill in provoking trouble for others.]This clever story had an ending that surprised me. The plaintiff wins, and is awarded $400 Million! The jury doesn't worry about giving away somebody else's money in punitive damages; there are no rational decisions here, just emotion and whimsy. Is this a loophole in the system? Why should one get so much and the other Four Hundred Thousand get nothing?   This book shows a den of thieves. People are honest until they are tempted. This reminds me of &#34;The Sting&#34;, whose moral was that swindles are OK if the sucker is worse than you. [Is this Real Life?] This book delivers an anti-smoking message without preaching. But how many will quit after reading it? The use of nicotine gum or patch should allow many to quit, if they so choose. Smoking, like other conditioned reflexes, is hard to break. The characters of Nicholas and Marlee are not credible to me. [I expected to find them as part of a Government sting operation to catch the &#34;jury consultants&#34;.]	2004-02-06

The bicycle craze of the 1890s taught America the benefits of personal transportation. The motorized carriage was the next logical step. These pioneers were self-taught skilled mechanics, born between 1857 and 1864. The main components existed, the principles were known; the automobile creators were not inventors in the strict sense. The automobile answered a need in rural life. Gasoline engines were in use as stationary power plants.<br /><br />America was not receptive to the new horseless carriage. These playthings of the rich were said by Professor Woodrow Wilson to \\"spread socialistic feelings\\"! The public resented the owners who drove as if they owned the road. The rich loved automobiles because they avoided the crowds at railroads. Song writers quickly connected sex with automobiles; they also became a favorite stage prop (\\"Man and Superman\\"). The French leadership in automobiles was partly due to Napoleon's legacy of good paved interurban highways (no \\"Red Flag\\" law). Neither mud or two feet of water could stop a horse. Frequent flats required an hour to repair the tube. Rural farmers learned how to sabotage cars: barbed wire in the road. These noisy machines panicked horses, cattle, and chickens. Speed traps were invented. Doctors were early adopters; they made house calls.<br /><br />Automobile companies began in Detroit rather than the machine companies of New England because the newly rich Midwesterners had a pioneering, gambling spirit; or the background knowledge that automobiles were a good thing. The wealth in Boston and New York shied away from those who claimed a machine would replace a horse! While a steam car needed over ten minutes to warm up, a gasoline engine could be started with one crank of the engine. Most manufacturers built large, expensive cars, leaving the sub $1,000 marketto Ford and others. The practice was to sublet parts manufacturing and just assemble the finished product. The NY financiers who owned the Selden patent threatened Ford and other manufacturers; this was an attempt to create a monopoly. But this was when Teddy Roosevelt started trust-busting. The Ford car was built with items that existed before the 1895 Selden patent; it worked better than the \\"modern cars\\". The Selden patent was overly broad: \\"any vehicle propelled by a hydrocarbon engine\\". The Supreme Court limit its coverage; Ford won, and was regarded as the \\"inventor\\" of the automobile by many.<br /><br />Billy Durant pioneered the integration of parts production within General Motors, and bought up many small companies. GM was listed on the NYSE in 1911, and paid the largest cash dividend ($50) in 1915. This was now the end of the pioneering era; Big Money controlled the automobile business. DuPont bought up a good chunk of GM. Henry Ford gained full control of the Ford Motor Co. The Great Depression killed off many of the small automobile manufacturers. After WW II there was the Big Three and the Little Nine. The 1950s saw the end for the latter; only American Motors lasted until around 1980.<br /><br />The sketch of an ignition system is mislabeled as the \\"automobile self-starter\\" (p.136 in Chapter 5).	2004-02-02

Married in 1855, they moved to Minnesota. When Minnesota became a state in 1857 Donnelly was elected lieutenant governor. In 1862 he was elected to Congress for three terms. He campaigned for Greenback policies and served in the state senate. Donnelly wrote &#34;Atlantis&#34; and &#34;Ragnarok&#34; which became sensational best sellers and made him wealthy. &#34;The Great Cryptogram&#34; analyzed Shakespeare's plays to prove they were written by Francis Bacon.

In 1887 he became a founder of the Populist Party, and was nominated for Vice-President in 1898. He died in Minneapolis on 1/1/1901. His politics, oratory, and literature marked his originality and talents; his writings are now out of fashion.   Donnelly studied the legends and mythologies of Hindus, Persians, Britons, Chinese, Greeks, Scandinavians, the North, Central, and South American Indians, Arabians, Babylonians, and Egyptians that told of disaster by fire, hail, frost, darkness, changes in climates, and tales of dragons and other monsters. Donnelly claimed these reflected a visit from a giant comet, and the proof lay in The Drift of unstratified deposits which came from a cometic collision rather than glacial movement. Donnelly suggested a comet could have caused Old Testament events such as the destruction of the wicked cities, the sun standing still, and stones falling from the heavens. Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Gods (or Rain of Rocks), commanded the interest of general readers, and the admiration (if not credence) of the scientific world. Donnelly, a good lawyer, argued his case well with all the evidence available to him at the time. Decades later Immanuel Velikovsky would publish his version of this theory.   The surface of our planet consists of layers of sand, clay, and gravel (over stratifiedrock). It contains no trace of fossils. The pre-glacial world saw tropical plants growing near the Arctic Circle in Miocene times. Herds of elephants and other animals lived in Europe. Donnelly says a sudden cataclysm brought severe cold, and left deposits of sand, clay, and gravel; fissures were created in earth's crust. He explains why this was caused by a comet striking earth, the heat vaporizing the seas to create clouds, rain, and snow. Rocks on the surface would be smashed and crushed. This collision was preserved in the legends of mankind. The Great Lakes suggest points of impact. Vast clouds, and debris in the sky, would create a &#34;nuclear winter&#34;.   Donnelly says myths and legends are ultimately based on some fact. Finding the same legends among different nations suggests a common experience in prehistoric times. These myths of a cataclysm imply the existence of mankind; they are in accord with the facts known to science and from deep excavations. The legends coincide in this: a monster in the air; the heat; the fire; the cave-life; the darkness; the return of light. Donnelly respectfully suggests the Book of Job is the oldest in the Bible, and gives a new viewpoint to the beginning of Genesis.   Donnelly answers objections in Part IV Chapter IV. The position of certain constellations in Job estimates this time as 30,000 years ago. Donnelly suggests the fire that seemed to drop out of the heavens and set a number of fires in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois on October 8, 1871 was the result of Bielas' comet. There is a universal feeling that regards comets with fear; Revelation (chapter xii, v.3) is a symbol of a comet brushing the earth. Why would God permit such a calamity? Perhaps what was destroyed was not worth preserving? It could be God's plan to punish the wicked of this world, says Donnelly.	2004-01-30

JCS interviewed participants, sifted through the HUAC records, the Baltimore libel suit, the two trials, and the appeals. JCS studied the memoirs of Chambers and Nixon, and analyzed the contents of that famous pumpkin. Alger Hiss (AH) defended himself unwisely at his trials. JCS covered the trial for the NY Herald Tribune.<br /><br />Chapter 2 tells how AH was recruited to Washington by Felix Frankfurter to work for the AAA. Chapter 3 tells of the Hiss family history in Baltimore from the beginnings. &#34;Alger&#34; was his father's middle name; his death left the family impoverished. AH went to Johns Hopkins and was the most popular man in his class. AH went to Harvard Law School and became a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Chapter 7 explains the politics of tariffs: domestic manufacturers lost through lowered tariffs; large landowners, bankers, and merchants won through increased trade. AH wrote legal opinions to justify FDR's policies. Chapter 8 deals with the United Nations. The Yalta agreement used deliberately ambiguous language to avoid open disagreement. When AH joined the Carnegie Endowment the rumors of Communism popped up (job rivalry?). The State Dept. affirmed the &#34;complete loyalty&#34; to John Foster Dulles. But AH was an FDR Democrat and out of style in Cold War America and its striving for hegemony in the &#34;American Century&#34;.<br /><br />Chapter 10 tells of AH at HUAC and his denial of hearing the name &#34;Whittaker Chambers&#34;. Nixon called this a fatal mistake. Chapter 11 says &#34;unfair and totally unjust accusations&#34; were the price to pay for public service. Nixon knew AH would be vulnerable in denying knowledge of &#34;Whittaker Chambers&#34;; how to prove a negative? WC's story of the donation of an old roadster belies his description of AH as &#34;disciplined&#34;. WC saw a picture of AH with his hand cupped to his ear and claimed AH was &#34;deaf in one ear&#34;; also untrue. Page 189 gives the truth to correct WC's lies. AH did object to giving personal details to HUAC to prevent WC from using this information to portray friendship (p.197). The libel trial forced WC to provide new documents and a changed story (p.224)! WC recalled documents that were not produced until two weeks later (p.240). The failure to examine these questioned documents hurt AH's legal defense. Page 260 has the question about the date of manufacture of the microfilm. Analysis of grain size and film layer technology could provide a better evaluation than recurring serial numbers. &#34;Could have been manufactured earlier&#34; is ambiguous. WC's espionage was confirmed by Julian Wadleigh's confession. Page 268 correctly questions the existence of typewritten copies when photography has been the preferred method since the 1920s. There was a problem in the typewriter and chain of evidence (p.269). WC could not recall the date, time, place, or other particulars when he received documents from AH!<br /><br />The analysis of the documents in Chapter 18 suggest they were deliberately created forgeries (p.345). Julian Wadleigh did pass documents to WC, and WC had a government job that allowed him passage into government buildings. Chapter 19 suggests the &#34;immutable witness&#34; of the typewriter was a fake, based on later evidence. Typewriters are machine-made, any two made at the same time are nearly alike. Differences arise later from use. There were similarities between the documents, but also places where letters didn't match at all (p.359). But it was too late to question this fake (p.360). Using moist typewriter ribbons made it impossible to determine the machine used (p.362). The serial number didn't match the date of purchase! The 16-page single-spaced report showed a skill level far in excess of Priscilla's ability, and Alger didn't type.<br /><br />Chapter 20 says AH's defense claimed this typewriter was given away, but they had no documentary proof. AH's memory was faulty on events from ten years ago. Some recollections conflicted with earlier testimony. Chapter 21 says the new judge in the second trial allowed previously excluded evidence and testimony. JCS attempts to provide an explanation that fits the undisputed facts (pp.406-416). WC had a typewriter in 1938 for his translation work. Could WC have switched another typewriter for the Hiss machine? [No one has commented on WC's fears of assassination and his long interest in suicide.] Chapter 22 summarizes the aftermath. The Hiss case became a symbol for the repudiation of FDR's policy of friendly relations with the Soviet Union. [Fear of secret traitors goes back a long time, to the Trial of Socrates.] Forged documents caused the guilty verdict, naive people trusted the prosecution and &#34;objective evidence&#34;.

The book lists the people involved, and a Bibliography of books, short stories, plays, an opera, a ballet, and articles and essays. It lacks an index. David Kent provides &#34;the essence of historical truth&#34; in this one best book on this topic. DK simply laid out the facts to let the reader come to his own conclusion, unlike other writers. Many are fascinated by that brutal slaying that remains an unsolved crime. The Preface provides a summary of previous books with his evaluations; he omits the books of Robert Sullivan and Arnold R. Brown. E.H. Porter was biased against Lizzie.<br /><br />Andrew Jackson Borden was the president of a Fall River bank and on the board of directors of three others. He owned substantial properties and was a director of three major textile mills. Fall River was famous for its cotton industry since the Civil War. DK quotes the 'Daily Herald' for the first news of the murders. There was a farm hand who wanted money from Mr. Borden (see Bertha Manchester?). There were imprints of two men in the hay (when?). The Medical Examiner said Mrs. Borden was killed by a tall man who struck from behind. A suspicious man was seen in the morning. The police searched high and low for any suspicious strangers. Lizzie said she had dressed to go shopping; after the murders she changed out of her morning dress. The 'Daily Herald' of August 5 sums up the problems for a concealed murderer (pp.25-30). Only two people were left alive that morning. Bridget was not a suspect after the first day. The jury said Lizzie wasn't guilty. Who was left?<br /><br />Chapter 4 tells of the problem in timing from 10:45 to 11:15. DK suggests falsified testimony from Bridget and Lizzie (p.36). That Friday evening Morse sneaked out of the house, unseen by the crowd in front or the police guarding the property. Could another have done this Thursday morning? What was the motive? Was the survivor the real killer (p.56)? Knowlton admitted he expected a not guilty verdict (p.78)! Chapter 8 tells of the crank letters and confessions, mostly anonymous (note the one from Albany NY). Reporter Henry Trickey was set up with a hoax story. Chapter 9 tells of the media circus and the beginning of the trial. Lizzie could not have done it unless she were insane, but there was not evidence of insanity or that she committed the murders. The house was searched room-by-room, each garment was examined on the outside, then turned inside out. ME Dolan said the killer was left-handed; Lizzie was right-handed.<br /><br />Chapter 12 mentions the cover-up by the Harvard Doctors who were prosecution witnesses; they withheld exculpatory evidence. There was no weapon, no bloodstained clothing, no hard motive, no eyewitnesses. Chapter 15 had the defense summation, still valid and valuable. In Chapter 16 Knowlton says there was a skeleton in the Borden household! At the end of the trial Justice Dewey addressed the jury that quickly acquitted Lizzie (Chapter 17). After the verdict a crowd of 2,000 gathered at the murder scene, but Lizzie and Emma stayed away (Chapter 18). The Epilogue tells us that a 'not guilty' verdict was not accepted by the masses; the stigma of the indictment and trial remained. &#34;Verdict first, then the trial&#34; is not just from 'Alice in Wonderland'. Can this happen again?<br />Arnold Brown’s book provides the best solution to this crime.ning? What was the motive? Was the survivor the real killer (p.56)?

But a publication will always reflect the bias of the owner (p.55); it is no more objective than a voter selecting candidates. Even allocating a story among different points of view reflects the judgment of the writers. Can a corporation dependent on advertising print news that offends its advertisers? The real problem is corporate ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations and their national censorship. And the lack of voluntary associations that can prevent a counterpoint to corporate propaganda. The talk of &quot;diversity&quot; seems to camouflage the growing monopolization of the press, which makes it less diverse.<br />This easy-reading and thought provoking book presents coverage of the news that you won't find in the corporate controlled media. When you read of hear their stories, measure them by asking: who benefits from this? How often do they advance democracy and the power of the people? You will gain wisdom and understanding of the special interests behind the news. Most of all, do not depend on just one source. BG shows how the networks are mostly like peas in a pot, and copy from the Establishment's newspaper of record, all the news that is printed to fit their agenda. BG's book seems to be repetitive in spots, and could use better editing. The chapters are unnumbered. The chapter on pages 185-196 has suppressed news that you should read.<br />&quot;Political correctness&quot; is the new word for &quot;thought control&quot; (p.1). This is as old as civilization. Manhattan is the headquarters of the ruling classes (banking, insurance, shipping, merchants, advertising, publications, broadcasting, etc.) since the 1880s (p.2). Why does BG quote Andrew Sullivan (p.3)? BG questions the &quot;vast liberal conspiracy&quot; phrase on page 4, but doesn't mention the National Association of Editors and Publishers! The denial of &quot;liberal bias&quot; seems to imply the media elite cannot admit their control by the owners (p.6). If reporters don't know whether they're Republicans or Democrats it could mean they're ducking a purge! Page 7 mentions the propaganda spouters on talk radio, but doesn't mention who pays for this. Are they cheaper than the music they replaced? Page 9 asks why there is &quot;no current liberal talk show host&quot;; this in a book that talks about bias? Page 10 mentions &quot;art&quot; that offends sensible people, but dares not say that corporations paid for it! George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; told where the opposition was controlled by the ruling class. Does this apply to arguments between Democrats and Republicans, who are the equivalent of professional sports teams? Its usually the public that loses from these battles (Bush's &quot;massive tax cuts for the rich&quot; on page 11). You can measure this by the decline in personal wealth since the Nixon Administration. BG's comparison of ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS to Fox is so outrageously biased as to need no comments (p.12). I wouldn't trust BG to shuffle a card deck! BG is also wrong in his reference to Sherlock Holmes (&quot;Silver Blaze&quot;) on page 14.	2004-01-15

Computer systems contain the skill and knowledge about a job so it can be done by those with less skill and knowledge.  The effect is to centralize control and move decision making to higher levels in the organization.  This book does not cover the large data entry sweatshops which are being decentralized (\\"work at home\\"?) or moved overseas.  While cost-cutting is one result of automation, the guiding principle is an irrational prejudice against people.    Chapter 1 has interviews with workers at a fast-food store. The central computer manages the store.  Chapter 2 tells about airline reservation agents.  The Canadian unions kept fixed schedules and standard wages; they also prevented monitoring individual agents.  Chapter 3 discusses the reforms of Social Work (p.75).  Each worker filled out a \\"penny slip\\" to account for their time.  Were they spending too much time on paper work and less time on social work? Chapter 4 tells about expert systems which codifies current knowledge to control the future.  If computers were invented in the 18th century would we still be at that level?  Isn't decadence defined as a failure to progress?  Chapter 5 explains the origin of Financial Consultants.  It is a way to get all your assets for their benefits (p.131).  \\"Wall Street is still the Wild West\\" (p.145).  Brokers like stocks and bonds because \\"you can expect to resell them in six months\\" (p.151).    Chapter 6 discusses \\"manufactured advice\\", like grids used in probation and \\"Workers Compensation\\".  Medical patients fill out their forms, not an experienced counselor.  [Do some talk-radio shows provide examples of \\"mass-produced personal advice\\" (p.159)?]  Chapter 7 discusses computer systems that measure management.  The purpose of this is to make people cheap and disposable in order to make a higher-quality product (p.166); does it work?  Generating more electronic mail is not measurably more efficient than one paper letter; the first increased the amount of labor needed.  Automation is one way to send your money to another company.  Most personal computers could support multiple users, but most software forbids concurrent usage.  More expensive networks are used!  A \\"Word Processing Specialist\\" won't correct silly errors because she no longer understands the subject (p.199).    Chapter 8 explains how electronic surveillance uses networked computers.  Distribution lists help to create junk E-mail (p.210).  The author believes individual monitoring should be outlawed.  Chapter 9 discusses the trend to piecework and temporary jobs, not full-time jobs with normal salaries and benefits (p.235).  Chapter 10 tells about Command and Control, and how it worked in Vietnam.  They used numbers to measure the war: body counts, sorties, bomb tonnage.  None of them worked (p.249).  You can't create an expert system if a human can't do it or explain how it is done (p.254).  Page 257 tells how the simpler Japanese numerical control systems outsold the expensive and unreliable American systems.  The problem with centralized decisions is they prevent quick decisions in the field, an ultimate inefficiency (p.261). The \\"Conclusion\\" can be tested against what has happened in the last 15 years.	2004-01-09

Spying was not considered dishonorable: an aristocrat could work as a laborer to carry out a mission (p.16).  The Japanese learned that the apparent honesty of Westerners cloaked devious purposes and selfish aims (p.22).  The 19th century brought threats to Japan from the imperialism of America, Britain, France, and Russia (p.31).  Japan was able to resist and remained independent, built up an army and navy, and gathered intelligence from Western nations.  They studied military factories and ship builders, and early on learned about inefficient production in the West (p.33).  The Japanese government kept tight control over industries handling military contracts.  Students were sent abroad to learn and gather intelligence legally (p.34).  They also created secret societies to gather intelligence from these volunteers.  One well-tried method to gather intelligence was to operate bordellos (blackmail, bribery).  The Black Dragon Society was founded to oppose Russians in Manchuria.  Japan signed a Treaty of Alliance with Britain in 1902.<br />The Russo-Japanese War began with the massive advance intelligence operations of Japan (p.52).  Japan severed diplomatic relations and then attacked the Russian ships at Port Arthur (p.59).  Some of their spies were trumped by Russian counter-intelligence (p.61).  Japan later entered into an alliance with Britain, France, and Russia for WW I (p.92); they captured German colonies in the Pacific (p.95). Japan tried to save the Romanovs (p.112) and began conflicts with the Bolsheviks.  American pressure on Britain put an end to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance (p.122).  Now Japan turned to Germany, its only possible ally (p.123).  Japan now began to move in on a divided China, like Western countries (p.129). Japan even sought to settle Jews in Manchuria (pp.145-6).<br />The &quot;Thought Police&quot; were created in1927 as part of a national spying system.  People were to report any suspicions about their neighbors (p.158).  The Kempei Tai created a secret society to eliminate all parliamentary political parties and became powerful and feared (p.162).  Espionage increased from the Panama Canal north into California in the 1930s.  Barber shops were used to collect gossip from US naval personnel!  Japan broke off negotiations with America on December 7, 1941.  Page 213 tells of plain-language coded messages that used double meanings.

All five burglars stood out against the usual suspects in police court; all had CIA connections.<br />Page 21 tells of the investigation into McCord's activities; he worked full-time for the Committee to Re-elect the President.  McCord followed orders unquestioningly, did not act on his own initiative.  Two of the burglars had the name and phone numbers of Howard Hunt.  This number led to Charles Colson, then to the R. Mullen Company.  Pages 24-25 tell how address books and telephone numbers were used in this investigation, with off-the-record reports.  While this burglary was bungled, how many others succeeded (p.26)?  The purpose of the break-in was for &quot;scandal, gossip&quot; (p.27). [To find someone vulnerable to bribery or blackmail who could be used as a spy or saboteur.]  There were too many coincidences in this story (some of these burglars were around when offices of prominent Democratic lawyers were burglarized).  While a burglary usually means taking something away, it could also be used to plant incriminating papers.  Days later John Mitchell resigned as manager of the Nixon campaign (p.30).  Bernstein went to Miami, and found out that a $25,000 check donated to President Nixon's campaign was deposited to the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars (p.44).  Page 45 gives an example of how confidential medical records are used in politics.  The GAO audit determined that over $500,000 in campaign funds was mishandled (p.40). They learned about money-laundering (p.54).  Page 55 explains how this is raised for protection money. <br />Bob Woodward had a secret source (&quot;Deep Throat&quot;) who confirmed information that had been obtained elsewhere (p.71).  These reporters had different styles (pp.49-51). The big news was that Attorney General John Mitchell authorized campaign funds for apparently illegal activities (p.98)!  Page 104 explains a clever denial.  Both reporters had sources in the Justice Department who could confirm details (p.111).  An unfair accusation in the 'Washington Post' could ruin careers.  The Watergate bugging made little sense by itself, but could indicate part of a broader campaign (pp.113-4); page 116 gives an example.  Page 127 tells how a faked letter could derail a successful campaign! The Nixon take-over of the Federal agencies was presented (p.130), as if it were subjecting the government and nation his personal whims.  There was subversion of the electoral process (p.135).  This was unprecedented in scope and intensity (p.143).  Page 147 tells of an imposter who imitated the voice of a McGovern campaign official.  There were other horror stories from the Muskie staffers (p.148). Control of the operations was traced to Nixon's appointments secretary, who had daily access to the President.  The rest of this book covers events from 1973 until early 1974.  Page 273 summarizes the connections (Chapter 13).<br />A &quot;third rate burglary&quot; led to White House personnel. Further investigations lead to wide-scale illegal fundraising, and political sabotage that involves misdemeanors and other crimes.  Most of those involved had little experience in politics.  The idol with feet of clay came crashing down.  Most people under 40 missed these events; learn about it from this book.	2004-01-05

There seems to be an undertone of envy and jealousy in Barbara's attacks on Hillary, who has succeeded in political life more than the author.  The Acknowledgments mention &#34;a series of teams&#34; for this product, but no details on the source of funds (p.327).  This book is the result from some political persecution of the Clintons (p.328).  Does Barbara's connections and allies make her a mirror image of Hillary?  Barbara's knowledge of Saul Alinsky raises this question.  Barbara unfortunately perished on one of the hijacked flights of 9-11-2001.  If this former Deputy AG was carrying a pistol many lives could have been saved.  Chapter One discusses the 1996 campaign, but does not tell why Bob Dole was picked to be the designated loser.  Barbara doesn't say if Hillary was the power behind the throne or merely a deputy (p.5).  Chapter Three tells of Hillary's early life and upbringing, which may explain her political outlook (p.30).  One minister may have shaped her mind (pp.31-33).  Was Hilary's passage to the left a reaction against her Dad?  Was  her &#34;toughness&#34; a result of failed heroes (pp.36-37)?  Yale Professor Kennedy taught Law as a &#34;social contract&#34; that expressed the need of the power structure (p.53); is this fact &#34;radical&#34;?  Chapter Four tells how Willy met Hillary and became of one mind (p.67).  Bill Clinton's father was a salesman and a lady's man (p.73). [Genetics?]  Chapter Five discusses the &#34;Children's Defense Fund&#34; which claims to help children (p.103).  Is Hillary a &#34;social engineer&#34; or an advocate for corporate rulers (p.113)?  Children of single parents are more exposed to destructive influences (p.116), such as corporate advertising.  Do attacks on families lead to even more child exploitation?  The sympathetic treatment from the corporate media suggests they are behind Hillary (p.115).  Chapter Six mentions Hillary among the &#34;100 most influential lawyers&#34; but wonders how to justify this (p.117)?  Perhaps powerful patrons planning ahead?  Does Hillary's involvement with &#34;children's rights&#34; reflect an unhappy youth (p.127)? Page 137 tells how Hillary's investment fund shorted pharmaceutical stocks as she pushed a national health care plan, then profited on the falling prices.  Pages 141-2 tell of the cattle futures deal.  Page 150 mentions the connection to the Nicaraguan Contra movement, but you must read Terry Reed's &#34;Compromised&#34; to learn of the Bush-Clinton connection.  There is no mention of Governor W. Rockefeller of Arkansas, &#34;a region rich in petroleum, coal, and natural gas&#34; (p.181).  Was Hillary the shrewdest campaign manager since Mark Hanna (p.216)?  Chapter Eight tells of other wives who exercised power: Wilson, Harding (!), Carter, Reagan (p.221).  Barbara tells how the Clintons improved Arkansas' education system (pp.224-30).  The sales tax was raised and there was more state control.  People paid more for a repackaged product (p.229)!  President Clinton had the right to replace the Travel Office, but lied about it (p.245). [Tricky Dick style?]  Pages 246-250 tell of Hillary's choices for the Dept. of Justice.  Hillary's Health Care plan seems to have failed due to a lack of realism, but Barbara gives no details.  This led to a loss of Democratic control of the House.  (So who were the Clintons working for?)  One item missing is the August 1994 golf date between Bill Gates and Bill Clinton.  Both carried identical gym bags to the golf cart, and each took one away.  Was there a switch involved? Next month the Dept. of Justice made a ruling favorable to Microsoft.	2004-01-05

There is no mention of any DNA match. The other claims are just as misleading or one-sided. It ignores the testimony of the ME who did the autopsies: &quot;the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11PM&quot;. How was that black glove planted - see the &quot;Legacy of Deception&quot;. The limo driver picked up OJ at 11PM, giving him an alibi that caused the jury to find him not guilty, despite planted evidence. DP criticizes the prosecution lawyers as &quot;haggard&quot; and &quot;apologetic&quot;. I think this was caused by their reasonable doubts - they no longer believed OJ was guilty. DP then says &quot;from what little I knew at the time there wasn't any concrete proof that the incriminating evidence against Simpson had actually been planted by the police officers&quot;. What does he now know, and when did he know it?<br /><br />Money was raised for the civil suit, they would not work on speculation. They appealed to the public. Yet they criticized OJ for raising money the same way! DP claims Paula dumped OJ, but he admits Paula returned from Las Vegas to sleep with OJ. Some break-up!  Chapter Six tells about the depositions. DP will try to give the worst interpretation to any statement; he is so clever at this. Neither the agent at the LAX ticket counter, or the passenger on that flight, saw any cuts on OJ's fingers. He tells about his use of the Schwartzes. DP treats OJ's friends with disgust - because they don't think the way he wants them to think!! Chapter Thirteen says Fuhrman was a &quot;star witness&quot;. How could he alone find evidence that the other detectives did not see? &quot;He should have told the truth&quot;. DP suggests Kardashian hid the bloody clothes and knives! DP then claims the golf bag contained the bloody knife. Chapter Sixteen tells about theNational Enquirer picture of OJ and those shoes. I remember those suede shoes were fuzzy but the sole had sharp details! There was a problem with the shadows, and the light on the sole. The Dec 1997 issue of 'Popular Mechanics' provides other examples of photo editing. This book has no pictures. Compare it to the other books, or true crime books in general.<br /><br />Chapter Eighteen tells about the &quot;mock trial&quot;. They used people off the street, tried out various arguments, then picked the ones most likely to convict. Is this the 'triumph of justice'? DP says the blood evidence was collected before OJ returned home from Chicago. But he doesn't tell that the blood sample from OJ and from the victims was collected before the evidence was submitted for testing! Evidence tampering had a powerful effect on the mock jury, so DP decided to negate this topic. The right judge can determine whether you win or lose; the defendant's law firm had prior problems with this judge! DP tells how they eliminated jurors who knew of Fuhrman's perjury. Chapter Twenty One tells how the trial was fixed. All the evidence collected by the LAPD would be assumed to be correct. It could not be questioned unless there was new evidence. In effect, any previously disputed and doubted evidence became Official Fact! Did somebody plant the glove? Did somebody else get the victim's blood before the Crime Lab got the evidence? Yes, but it didn't matter! &quot;It does not matter how the evidence was collected&quot;. The defense was even prevented from arguing that anyone else was the killer! Only the evidence that showed Simpson was guilty would be allowed in the trial. Even Fuhrman's perjury would be excluded. DP says only the victim's or OJ's blood was found at the murder scene. But when the blood and skin found under Nicole's fingernails did not match OJ (or Ron or Nicole), they had a clever answer for this. OJ had no scratches or bruises at all. The blood on OJ's socks was less degradedthan from the autopsy vial. Unpreserved blood would be more degraded, not less! Could this be a sign of manipulation of evidence? Read how DP cleverly turns this about. Note their care in framing questions so OJ could not say &quot;someone planted it&quot;. DP claims the limo driver said the Bronco was not in Rockingham at 10:03; but the limo driver did not arrive before 10:22! Is this honest?<br /><br />Is absence of evidence a  proof of guilt? DP cleverly misrepresents the purpose of the control swatch; they are NOT supposed to contain anyone's DNA. They tell of the questioned Buffalo photo. Since the camera was stolen, there was no way to corroborate the story! The defense's photo expert pointed to differences between the other negatives on the film. They claim &quot;the shoes in this particular photograph ... have not been altered or changed in any way&quot;. But the question was the photograph altered in any way? See it for yourself. Was Nicole was the target, and Ron the innocent bystander? The 25-30 wounds on Ron say he was the target of a frenzied attack, and Nicole was quickly killed as the innocent bystander. DP says &quot;they found blood dropped all over his house&quot;. In fact, drops of blood were found outside leading to the front door, but not inside the house. Were they planted by someone who had no access to the house? DP says the cuts on OJ were made by the victim's fingernails, but it did not match OJ by type or DNA! DP is one clever lawyer! The FBI and LAPD donated thousands of dollars of their services to assist a private litigant. You can decide if this is a vendetta of bias. The judge's instructions to the jury: the criminal verdict didn't matter, nor the custody verdict. Did his other rulings help to fix the case?  DP does NOT tell that the verdict was timed to interfere with President Clinton's State of the Union address. Part of a right wing conspiracy? The last chapter claims OJ &quot;was worth substantially more&quot; than $25 million &quot;because of his notoriety as a famous killer&quot;. How big a lie is that? The red liquid blood found by the bodies after midnight says they were murdered after 11:30PM. OJ Simpson is innocent.<br /><br />Chapter Twenty One tells how the trial was fixed.

The book would have been stamped \\"Adults Only\\" in your public library. Its language reflects the culture of 1940s America. Don't let it prevent you from learning how things worked in those days.<br />Thirty years ago VP Agnew was forced to resign because he was still taking pay-offs from his state. \\"The Washington Payoff\\" told about a Supreme Court Judge taking a money-filled suitcase. In the 1980s drug money was found in AG Meese's personal checking account. Who is guilty today? How much has changed over the last fifty years?<br />One change is the increasing monopolization by large publishing corporations. That may explain why such books are no longer published. An occasional article in a small magazine does not match the audience of a paperback, and TV does not provide these details.<br />This book documents the hidden side of Washington, especially the shady, sinful side. While some details may be obsolete, I wonder if the broad details have changed? Some of the examples given can serve as a warning to any visitor to a big city. The authors also sketch Baltimore and Maryland, a quick train ride from Washington. Also close is Philadelphia and New York, also by train. Travel by train is one obvious difference from fifty years ago, as is increased life in the suburbs.<br />The authors said that crime is under-reported in Washington, and explain why. Is this still true? They also said that it was illegal to carry a gun without a license, but judges rule that carrying an unloaded gun was legal even if the bullets were in another pocket. Are the Federal judges that liberal today?	2003-12-19

[It is NOT just \\"personal irresponsibility]. More people go bankrupt than suffer heart attacks, cancer, or divorce! The average two-income family earns far more than the single income family a generation ago, yet have far less discretionary income (p.51). Financial problems are statistically linked with marital problems. Economic forces are battering the American family. The three indicators for bankruptcy are: possible foreclosure on a home, medical bills that can't be paid, credit card debt that can never be paid.     Chapter 2 discusses the Over-Consumption Myth. The average family spends less on clothing and appliances. More at restaurants but less on groceries. Most increased spending went into homes; there has been a huge increase in prices (p.22) due to concerns for safety and education (p.23). In the 1970s most Americans believed schools were as good or better than in earlier times; not today (p.25). [The authors do not investigate what Federal laws caused this.] They give one example on how crime is used to generate housing profits (p.27)! [Does this reflect the restrictions on Second Amendment Rights?] Forcing movement into suburbs creates the need for \\"a second car\\" and ultimately benefits Big Oil. The best way to get out of the \\"Housing Trap\\" is to improve public education (p.33). If the restrictions between location and schooling were eliminated, there would still be the problem of transportation. [Would those who benefit from the current politics ever allow these changes? You need a new popular political force to change existing laws.] Government-subsidized day care would add more pressure on mothers to join the workforce (p.40); this would lower wages again. Americans view a college degree as the \\"single most important\\" thing for success. Faith in higher education is a new secular religion. [Does the college degree correlate with the decline of the middle class: owner operated farms and businesses? Did America prosper and thrive before WW II just by growing crops and making things?]     Chapter 3 explains the economic benefits of non-working mothers as a safety net\\" caregivers who can reenter the work force as needed. Chapter 4 refutes the charge that bankruptcy is a moral failure. No one chooses to get sick to run up high medical bills, or ship their jobs offshore. You can't run up high credit card bills unless bankers raise your limit. Chapter 5 says single mothers are more likely to file for bankruptcy, an increase of 600%! A divorce splits the assets, but both are 100% responsible for the debts. Divorced fathers who owe child support are more likely to file for bankruptcy. Page 113 charts the changes in personal savings. Chapter 6 explains the debt explosion by the deregulation of banking (p.128). Rising interest rates were followed by increasing bankruptcies. Easy loan money has a hidden price tag (p.133). Some banks issue unaffordable mortgages so they can foreclose and sell the house again! Stores earn more profits from interest and late fees than from selling merchandise (p.144). The Savings & Loan disasters of the late 1970s were caused by the currency devaluation by the Federal Reserve. Deregulation of interest rates caused a massive increase in bankruptcies, but politicians refuse the cure of regulation (p.152).     Chapter 7 is the most important. It says collective action is the most effective remedy and essential for reestablishing economic security for the middle class. Most financial planning books assume steady work, good health, no emergencies. But what if your job is lost? Can you cut back on fixed expenses? Be prepared for an emergency. Beware of long-term financial commitments (p.166). Credit card insurance is useless, your heirs are not required to pay your balance. The authors offer advice for those in deep debt (pp.168-169). Creditors are notyour friends. Corporations that file for bankruptcy don't feel guilt. Economic difficulties and family problems like divorce lead to falling test scores, low self-esteem, discipline problems, and depression. American families need to organize to solve their problems (p.180).	2003-11-24

Kennedy and the Dallas coverup	Books	5	4	8	N	N	It Blew the Lid off the Cover-Up	The voice stress analyzer (VSA) is an electronic device that analyzes spoken words and determines if the speaker is lying. It is similar to the stress detector that measures heart rate, breathing, and perspiration (\\"lie detector\\") of a live human. The VSA does not require the knowledge, cooperation, or presence of the subject. It can be used with recordings to test the dead. George O'Toole compiled copies of all recordings of the assassination. He then interviewed as many of the principle players as possible and recorded their conversations. This book is the result. This 1975 book seems to have caused the Congressional Select Committee that re-investigated the assassination, and uncovered the facts used in the second wave of books on the subject after 1977. The first wave was the books published in the late 1960s.     The conclusion is that JFK was killed by a conspiracy, and Lee Harvey Oswald was innocent. There were two interlocking conspiracies: one small and tightly organized to shoot JFK; another large and loosely organized to cover it up. The latter involved those who became involved accidentally, reluctantly, or after the fact; they were the weakest links. A fanatic will use a pistol since they don't care if they are caught (Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley). A hired killer will use a rifle to allow time to escape before the police discover the location (JF Kennedy, ML King, Judge Woods). The Appendix discusses the commercial rivalry between the older \\"lie detectors\\" and the newer PSE used to analyze voices. The Kubis study was not done by either Kubis or his assistant; they subcontracted defectively recorded audio tapes and received poor results!     The Introduction discusses the Anglo-Saxon conceit that political mischief only happens in non-English speaking nations. It can happen anywhere there is an unresolved conflict among the ruling classes. Watergate revealed this self-evident truth. Like the assassination of Napoleon Bonaparte, time passed before the truth came out. Just as you may be able to detect something wrong from the tone of a voice known to you, the PSE uses objective rules to detect stress in a voice (correlates to telling a lie). \\"It has demonstrated, beyond any reasonable doubt, that every major conclusion of the Warren Report is wrong\\" (Chapter 1). Any questions about the Warren Report should follow the laws of science and logic. Researchers into the 26 volumes found many facts that did not lead to a lone gunman. Sylvia Meagher's \\"Accessories After the Fact\\" is one example (p.15). Chapter 2 discusses some of the problems with the Warren Report. Governor Connally was wounded by a second shot that could not have come from Oswald's rifle (p.23). The angle and elevation from the \\"Oswald window\\" could not pass thru JFK and then hit Connally (p.26). Expert marksmen could not fire that rifle quickly and accurately (p.27). Page 32 quotes a policeman that the bullet dug from General Walker's wall was steel jacketed, not the copper jacketed bullet in the National Archives! There are three important points about the back wound in the Bethesda body: 1) it was below the shoulders, not in the base of the neck; 2) the bullet entered at a steep downward angle that did not line up with the throat wound; 3) the bullet only penetrated a short distance. The Wecht-Smith analysis of the medical evidence was that there were two gunmen firing from the School Depository, neither from the \\"Oswald window\\" (p.38). One interesting note on page 36 concerns the photographs whose facial features \\"are consistent with\\" the recollections of the President's. This is NOT saying the facial features were in fact that of the President! See for yourself.	2003-11-22

Tippit and Lee Harvey Oswald	Books	5	27	32	N	N	The Conspiracy Theory Critique	I first heard of Mark Lane (ML) in 1961 when he revealed that the Republican Speaker of the NY Assembly was part owner of a firm that could get the contract to build \\"fallout shelters\\" in NY state. The bill was defeated, and Mark Lane was later dropped from his Democratic Party office. When ML read the news report of Lee Harvey Oswald's guilt, he wrote an article that noted the contradictions. ML was then asked to be Oswald's lawyer before the Warren Commission. ML continued his investigation into the Warren Report; this book is his critique. ML gave lectures on his findings. David S Lifton was in the audience one day. DSL began to investigate the Warren Report and other articles. He then wrote \\"Best Evidence\\", the first book to point to \\"alterations of the wounds\\" to cover up the shootings from the front.    The Introduction by Hugh Trevor-Roper says the Warren Commission's function was to pass judgment on the facts given to it. They depended on the FBI, the Secret Service, and the police; did the latter reach a conclusion that was seconded by the Warren Commission? [The book \\"Act of Treason\\" by Mark North presents a final judgment and resolution of the JFK Assassination.] Why didn't the Warren Commission have a Devil's Advocate to represent the interests of the accused? The assumption that Oswald acted alone was take for granted: the fix was in. The Warren Report must be judged by the validity of its arguments. Many have found defects in it. HTR says \\"a pattern was made to emerge out of the evidence .. and seemed to subordinate the evidence to it\\" (p.10). One of the most important questions is: how did Patrolman Tippit know to stop Oswald? Evidence which seems solid at first fades away like a mirage when it is investigated (p.11). HTR says the Warren Report is NOT a faithful summary of the evidence. There is also evidence that was not presented to the Commission, but should not be rejected out of hand. The Warren Report has a whole series of conclusions based on carefully selected evidence, and ignored evidence that did not support their conclusion. One Commission lawyer said that no court could legally have found Oswald guilty. [Did the quick killing of Oswald point to a wider conspiracy?] The experienced doctors at Parkland Hospital said the wounds came from the front, and so did most of the onlookers there. This circumstantial evidence is more reliable than a \\"magic bullet\\" or other planted evidence.     If there is a lack of confidence in the evidence, and the Commission's handling of it, then was the Commission deceived or were they dishonest? Some might claim that the Commission of public figures and professional lawyers could not conspire to cover up a crime. [But isn't all that part of their daily life? See Watergate.] HTR says it could arise from prejudging a case before all the evidence has been seen. This is a very common psychological fact. HTR says the quantity of evidence presented in such a short period of time prevented any objective examination. The Commission accepted the foregone conclusion before they were given the evidence. Page 18 lists many unanswered questions. After forty years only one thing is certain. The conspiracy that killed JFK got away with it.     This 1966 book lacks the photographs that became available many years later. This pioneering book is still a classic critique after forty years. Mark Lane was hired by Lee Harvey Oswald's mother to defend LHO before the Warren Commission. These are ML's comments on the Warren Report.    Chapter 1 tells of the suspicious activity that occurred in the parking lot overlooking Elm St. Chapter 2 asks where the shots came from. 58 of the 90 witnesses questioned said the shots came from the grassy knoll. The actions at the time speak louder than anything said in the following weeks. Chapter 3 says JFK was hit first by a bullet in the throat, an entry wound; JFK had a massive wound in the rear portion of his skull. \\"Skull matter\\" was found on the south side of Elm Street; this is consistent with a bullet fired from the north. The police officers to the left of the limousine were spattered, consistent with a bullet fired from the right front. The Zapruder film shows Governor Connally shot from the back about 1.30 seconds after JFK's first wound. This suggests a second shooter.    Chapter 4 is on \\"The Magic Bullet\\" which allegedly hit JFK, then struck Governor Connally in his rib and wrist, yet remained in pristine condition. Chapter 5 wonders why a description of Oswald was broadcast at 12:45 pm when he wasn't charged with shooting JFK until the next morning. Oswald wasn't the only absent employee. Chapter 6 tells of the testimony from the 3 men on the fifth floor, and how it was changed for the Commission. Chapter 7 notes the testimony of the other witnesses: the shots sounded like they came from west of the School Book Depositary. None of these witnesses were called before the Commission! Chapter 8 discusses the 7.65 mm Mauser discovered on the sixth floor at 1:22 pm. The next day the 6.5 mm Mannlicher-Carcano was substituted for it! Chapter 9 discusses the tests of the alleged assassin's weapon. None of the experts who fired the weapon could hit the head or neck of the target.    Chapter 10 tells of the fictitious name \\"A J Hidell\\" used by Oswald. \\"Hidell\\" was the nickname of a Marine who served with Oswald and lived in New Orleans. Who else was entitled to receive mail at that post office box? Chapter 11 shows how the Commission created a story against the eyewitness testimony. Chapter 12 tells how a paraffin test cleared Oswald from firing a rifle that day! The freshly painted boards would give a positive response from both hands. Chapter 13 notes the 43 minutes from leaving the Depository to the shooting of Officer Tippit. No one saw Oswald leave the building. ML analyzes the other problems with the Commission's story. There are discrepancies between the different eyewitnesses stories.     Chapter 14 discussesthe eyewitnesses to the shooting of Officer Tippit. One testimony \\"was inconsistent with the known facts or the Commission's conclusions or both\\". Chapter 15 says the two other witnesses who saw the killing who saw the killing did not identify Oswald. One who saw two men was warned not to talk - or she might be killed. The four bullets found in Tippet's body could not be matched to Oswald's revolver. There was a problem identifying the four shells. The found jacket had a laundry tag but could not be traced! Chapter 16 tells of the murder of Oswald while in police custody. There were warnings about Oswald's safety, and requests to move Oswald in secret on Saturday, but the Dallas PD held to the announce schedule.    The remaining chapters deal with Jack Ruby, the Oswalds, and the Commission. Later books had more of the facts gained from the Congressional Investigation. This remains one of the first books to critique the Warren Report.	2003-11-13

Section 3 discusses the problems of disarmament: economic reinvestment, or &quot;the non-military functions of war in modern societies&quot; (p.25). Section 4 points out that plans for peace assume wars support the social systems. War resolves conflicts of interest between nations or classes (p.28). Since conflicts of interest are eternal, so is war. Peace is what breaks out between wars (p.29). Section 5 discusses the function of war: it is used by and for a ruling class to defend &quot;the national interest&quot;. Its non-military function is to subject the economy to complete and arbitrary central control (p.35). It stabilizes the economy of industrial societies by creating an artificial demand, and protects against another depression. The civilian standard of living rose during WW II. A military force is needed both for a foreign policy, and to assure the legitimacy and existence of a government (p.39); it can absorb the unemployed. One item in this satire is to link restrictions on grain production in America to &quot;famine in Asia&quot;! Another is to claim a lower speed limit would save 40,000 lives a year (p.46)! But the funniest item is the claim that the Department of Defense is stockpiling birds (p.51)! &quot;War is the  principal motivational force for the development of science at every level.&quot; From poison gas to atomic bombs.<br />Section 6 says substitutes for the functions of war must be &quot;wasteful&quot;, and operate free of the supply-demand system. All depressions occurred during low military spending (p.58). Alternatives to military spending are inadequate because they cost too little (p.60). The uncontrolled and arbitrary spending on space research make it a good alternative. The end of war would mean the end of national sovereignty. There would be no effective external pressure for a nation to organize itself politically. How to employ the unemployed? The WPA and CCC provide examples. An expanded prison system (&quot;slavery&quot;?) holds the unemployed. Do we need a &quot;menacing social enemy&quot; to serve a function? Would we need to re-create the Spanish Inquisition or witch hunts for &quot;national security&quot; (p.71)? Should procreation be limited to artificial insemination and laboratory embryos to control population levels (p.73)? Would birth control pills be put into water and essential foods? An excess population is war material (p.74). Would scientific progress cease in a peaceful world (p.78)? Section 7 has a Summary and Conclusions. War is not a means to an end but the purpose of modern societies. War has five non-military functions: economic, political, sociological, ecological, and cultural-scientific. They discuss the criteria, models, and evaluation of substitutes for the functions of war. &quot;Genuine total peace ... would be destabilizing&quot; (pp.90-91) Our government should plan for the possibility of a general peace because of its dangers to society (p.94). Section 8 has their recommendations. The best satire is the last sentence in the book (p.101). But the book seems to use a lot of words to say very little. It wasn't written by a George Orwell or Aldous Huxley.	2003-11-09

This book preserves the manners and culture of America circa 1940, both in what he wrote and what he didn't write. Michener shows his artistry in his descriptions of the foliage, flowers, seas, lights, and the people. Michener served in the Navy during WW II, and wrote many other books over the next fifty years. In 1960 he ran for office as a JFK Democrat, in 1968 he was a delegate to the Democratic Convention pledged to RFK.<br />These stories describe life on the islands of the South Pacific. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; tells of the Japanese invasion fleet that threatened New Zealand. The civilian population would flee to the hills, leaving the old men and boys to guard the beaches with picks and axes; they had no other weapons. &quot;Mutiny&quot; tells of Norfolk Island, the former prison that was inhabited by the descendants of the Mutineers on the Bounty. They had to cut down old pine trees to make an airport. &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; tells of the Ensign who had too much time on his hands. &quot;The Cave&quot; tells how they received information on Japanese activities until their coastwatcher was eliminated. &quot;The Milk Run&quot; tells of a rescue of a downed pilot. &quot;Alligator&quot; is about the planning and background for the attack on Kuralei in the coming months. &quot;Dry Rot&quot; tells of the skin diseases and other disorders from living on an island in the tropics. <br />&quot;Fo' Dolla'&quot; subtly explains political economy, the effect of plentiful money on an isolated region, and the interaction of human emotions and power; all wrapped up in a colorful story. The Sea Bees made war souvenirs and grass skirts. &quot;Passion&quot; tells of a problem in censoring personal letters. &quot;A Boar's Tooth&quot; notes the religious ways of some island peoples. Can a pig be sacred? Is pain and suffering at the center of all religions? Was Michener an Agnostic? &quot;Wine for the Mess at Segi&quot; explains the travails of getting refreshments for Christmas. When the celebration ends, they learn they will hit the next beachhead. &quot;The Airstrip at Konora&quot; tells about capturing an enemy-held island and creating a 6,000-foot airstrip from coral.<br />&quot;Those Who Fraternize&quot; tells about the French colonial planter's society, and their relations with the Navy. &quot;The Strike&quot; describes the Kuralei operations, the Supply Depot, and the masses of goods needed for the invasion. Naval aviators loved baseball caps (did this create the fashion?) The author tells how important it could be to know an admiral! The big attack on the Depot came from a hurricane. An ammunition carrier anchored in the channel exploded; no one ever found out why. &quot;Frisco&quot; tells of the beginning of the assault on Kuralei. This is continued in &quot;The Landing on Kuralei&quot; which describes the landing on the beaches. This is the climax of the book. &quot;A Cemetery at Hoga Point&quot; wraps up the story. Who replaces the good men who died, asks Michener.<br />We now know that the Japanese code was broken before Pearl Harbor, and our top military leaders knew of their plans. The emphasis was on first winning the war in Europe. The island hopping strategy was based on winning the war with minimal means. Japan lost the war with the Battle of Midway; they gambled on a quick victory, and lost.	2003-11-07

A forensic expert's testimony can mean the difference between a conviction and a miscarriage of justice. Hunters and gatherers of crops have long been important for discovering lost bodies. Connecting found bones to a missing person does not always lead to a suspect. The rules of evidence in court require a witness to speak from his observations, not from other's reports. Archeology is closely related to forensic anthropology. Human skeletal identification was used during the Korean hostilities. Forensic anthropology can enable the bones to speak in police investigations! The analysis of modern violence can explain what happened centuries ago. Large samples of skeletons can be used to determine the frequencies of various diseases. The 33,000 skeletons in the National Museum of Natural History provide a standard of comparison. Statistics promote objectivity.     As a young student Ubelaker wrote a term paper on the femur. You could determine that it was human, the height, estimate the sex, age at death, ethnic origin, body weight, patterns of locomotion, clues to certain diseases, indications of occupation, and sometimes how he died (p.45). About 10% of those executed for murder were subsequently proven innocent (p.63)! The low number of reported poisonings suggest that medical examiners should be more vigilant in identifying murder victims (p.62). An \\"accidental overdose\\" could be murder. Far more crimes are committed with paper and a pen (p.74). Chapter 6 tells about distinguishing human from animal bones. Chapter 7 tells of determining sex, size, race, and age at death. Chapter 8 tells that much may be learned from the environment where a body was found. Time since death can be estimated from the type of insects feeding on the corpse (p.108).     Tooth marks on bones can hide or destroy evidence, or create false clues. Insects, larvae, and mollusks can create signs of pathology. Issuing more hunting licenses can result in more found remains (p.120). Chapter 10 explains how \\"dreams\\" can help solve crimes. Chapter 11 says attempts to hide a murder by burning attracts attention to the crime, even if they destroy some evidence. Chapter 13 tells what can be learned from larvae in a body. Chapter 14 says sketches based on skulls are not too accurate, but work because they are close enough to get a response from someone 9p.169). The interpretation of evidence can be highly subjective, as when expert witnesses disagree (p.195). Do professional witnesses shape their testimony to please their clients (p.196)?     Chapter 16 shows Ubelaker misquoting that Borden jingle (p.208). Does the \\"alleged murder weapon\\" have a chain of custody? Page 221 tells of a skull drilled by a .25 caliber Black & Decker! \\"Children who are loved grow faster than those who are not\\" (p.228). The big challenge is to distinguish between evidence of foul play from other environmental changes (p.298). If other people know of a murder, eventually they will tell (p.258). Chapter 21 explains why there are so few serial killers around. A lot of murders go unrecognized (p.263). Chapter 22 tells of murderers that almost got away with it. The murderer of a Swansea Mass girl was named as a suspect, confessed to at least six of his friends, but wasn't prosecuted until five years later. Chapter 24 tells of the need to keep a certain distance from cases to preserve objectivity, and any emotional drain.	2003-11-03

Mary Roach is a journalist who writes about subjects that fascinate her. Is she \\"quirky\\" for writing about a subject that is more obscene than sex? Roach writes a regular column for 'Readers Digest', and these twelve chapters read like magazine articles. You won't have to run to the dictionary with this book. Chapter 1 tells you to avoid surgery by residents if you are in a teaching hospital. Chapter 2 tells of the historic problem of providing medical specimens. Sometimes these \\"resurrectionists\\" only took the teeth (don't ask!). Chapter 3 explains the experiments at the UT Anthropological Research Facility. Don't read this after eating! The Civil War need for shipping bodies promoted embalming. Chapter 4 tells how corpses are used to measure damage from driving accidents in order to build safer cars; dummies are then used for measuring forces. This resulted in safer windshields, and collapsible steering wheels and front halves to save lives. So do lap-shoulder belts, air bags, dashboard padding and recessed knobs. Even if air bags sometimes injure or kill when deployed! Increased survivability has led to study of ankles, knees, feet, and shoulders. Chapter 5 discusses the damage done by airplane crashes. The cockpit flight recorder and black box are the first source of information; afterwards it is the pattern of injuries on \\"the human wreckage\\". \\"Sit near an emergency exit\\", next to a window, in First Class. Chapter 6 is a history on the use of cadavers to test firearms. Mary doesn't know the meaning of the word \\"bolo\\" (p.133). Nor does she understand the effects of stimulant in combat (p.136). Gelatin products include marshmallows, nougat candy fillings, liquorice, caramels, vitamin gel caps (p.139). This chapter ends on a discussion of the best footwear to use for land mine clearance.<br />Chapter 7 tells about the use of cadavers in crucifixion experiments. With the pain, the crucified die from asphyxia. The nail went in through the palm and out the back of the wrist (Zugibe, p.163), not through Destot's space. Chapter 8 discusses \\"organ recovery\\", usually from young healthy accident victims. Mary doesn't understand the fear of live burial in the 19th century 9p.188). At least one example in New Orleans (1850s) is known from the recurrent cholera epidemics. Chapter 9 tells about experiments on detached heads. People put into isolation chambers without sensory input \\"have gone literally crazy\\" (p.211). Could a head transplant be done in the future? Not if the insurance companies won't pay (p.215). Chapter 10 gives the history of medicinal cannibalism! Mary is not making this up. Aren't you glad to be living in modern times? Mary offers an explanation for these cures (p.227). The use of alcohol in these elixirs may explain their success. We still use human blood in transfusions, and HGH. Mary explains the Soviet use of cadaver blood (p.230). Read the rest of this chapter on an empty stomach. Chapter 11 introduces a new method for corpse disposal: cooking in lye (p.253). It's fuel efficient. Another method is human composting as a cheaper burial method (p.264). The chapter discusses the problems with each method. Chapter 12 recycles a Salon.com column about going to Harvard. Mary tells of \\"polymer-preserved\\" bodies: $50,000 to last ten thousand years. Mary's personal history suggest your remains should be handled according to your family's wishes. <br />This book is written in a smirky, sarcastic style that detracts from any serious treatment of this educational topic.	2003-10-28

This book provides a general history of the communicable diseases that affect many persons at one time. Several diseases, like tuberculosis, were omitted. The authors cover the written record from before 1500BC to the 1970s. It is hard to identify the diseases from more than 600 years ago. An endemic disease is one that is part of everyday life in a region. An epidemic disease is one that quickly affects a large number of people. The book does not cover social diseases like pellagra, or industrial diseases.<br />The Plagues of Pharaoh are the best know plagues of ancient times. The authors say they were a series of natural catastrophes from drought (p.4). Dried rivers, dust storms, diseased cattle and men, then a crop failure followed by locusts. The strict adherence to dietary laws saved the Israelites. Other pages tell of diseases from eating fish from rivers used to dispose of plague victims; pigs and dogs are known to be carrion eaters. Quail fallen from the skies suggests they died of a disease. Burning aromatic herbs may protect against plague (p.6) like citronella candles against mosquitoes. Ticks and fleas have long passed on typhus, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, etc. Rats and mice too. Invading armies are also transmitters of disease.<br />The severe plague that hit Rome in 452BC affected society (as in medieval times): people disregarded the norms of their society. Could this happen today after a disaster? The only comparable even was the gasoline shortages of the 1970s, but people weren't dying from that.<br />Given the current level of medical knowledge the plagues of the past should not reoccur. But what if the Power Elite decides to stop vaccinating against a disease like smallpox? Would an epidemic be an accident or the result of this calculation? Readers of &quot;Rule by Secrecy&quot; by Jim Marrs might nor view this as an accident.<br />The Roman plague of the 5th century BC was followed by a reform of the laws (pp.16-7). This also happened after the Black Death in England (14th century). What would happen after a Nuclear Winter? Pages 194-5 tell of the political unrest that followed the cholera epidemics. Another effect was to create Boards of Health and public water and sewage systems in the cities. Cholera was possible because of the rapid transportation from steam power. Previously people would die before they could infect others. This book will teach you many facts that are censored from the usual academic histories. The outbreak of cholera in 1833 Mexico was followed by the revolts in Zacatecas and Texas.<br />Oliver Wendell Homes wrote about the contagiousness of puerperal fever in 1843, and the need for cleanliness. A. Conan Doyle held him in such esteem he gave the last name to his fictional detective. It is educational to read of the controversy on puerperal fever (Chapter 13).	2003-10-26

Homer Croy was the first student of the first school of journalism in the world (University of Missouri). He was born close to Jesse James' farm. Cole Younger came from the most fought-over county in Missouri; fighting began before the Civil War and continues after its end. Cole first killed at 17, was wanted dead or alive at 18, rode with Quantrill at 19. He killed 17 men, was wounded 30 times, but died peacefully in bed with 14 bullets in him. In between he spent over 25 years in prison. If you wonder about strife in countries in countries (like Yugoslavia) just read about the Border War in America circa 1860. I enjoyed the style of writing. This is history written by a journalist. You'll not be bored, since it reads like the newspaper story it was. Most of the great Civil War outlaws were born within 30 miles of Kansas City. Henry Washington Younger was one of the richest and important men of Jackson County, and was elected 3 times to the Missouri legislature, and a mayor in 1859. Thomas Coleman Younger was the 7th son of 14 children. One of Cole's teachers was Stephen B Elkins, later US Senator from West Virginia; Cole saved his life. <br />The Border War was conducted by gangs who were mostly interested in plunder first, flag second. Most families were peaceful, but could not avoid the troubled times. An incident at a dance forced Cole to become a hunted man. The holdup and murder of his father by Kansan Red Legs embittered Cole. Cole joined the Confederate Army, and was famed for his ruthlessness in battle, yet was kindly and considerate afterwards. Cole took part in the raid on Lawrence Kansas.<br />After the war ended Cole and Frank James invented bank robbery in Liberty Missouri 1866. Since Cole was well known, he quickly left for Texas. They gambled away their loot in Dallas. But they had been recognized, and the Pinkertons put their names on a wanted poster: Cole and Jim Younger, Frank and Jesse James, Jim Cummings, Charlie Pitts. Chapter VIII explains how the James-Younger gang covered their tracks; but they were still pursued. Since their gang was well-known, they decided to strike out for Minnesota. Their attempt in Northfield left four of their group dead, others wounded, without a cent. (The unclaimed bodies were donated to medical science.) The quick-witted Cole created a political reason to rob this bank: General Benjamin F Butler was an owner! Cole would say what it took to escape hanging. By pleading guilty they escaped execution. Cole became a model prisoner to get a pardon.<br />After his pardon, Cole was introduced to modern wonders: the telephone, the horseless carriage, the phonograph. For the first time in 25 years Cole saw a sunset. When Cole got an unconditional pardon, he returned to Missouri. After failing as a salesman, Cole joined the \\"Cole Younger-Frank James Wild West Show\\" until he retired. There is one interesting item: the Youngers were all Southerners, but their father was a Union sympathizer and did not believe in slavery! Was Cole a victim of circumstances (Chapter XVIII)? \\"In wartime men are rewarded for doing what will get them hanged in peacetime\\" said Niccolo Machiavelli.	2003-10-23

Books	5	7	8	N	N	His Career in the LAPD	The Prologue starts with his visit to Washington for a conference on violence. He returned to Los Angeles at the time of the Rodney King attack. (Who was minding the store?) Chapter 1 tells of his early life, and the impact of the Depression on his family. His father's lost job was followed by alcoholism and hard times; they depended on government handouts (p.6). His mother was the backbone, and sole support of the family; his father was often in trouble with the Glendale police. After graduating from High School, Daryl joined the Navy and saw action in the Pacific. Daryl went to college on the GI Bill, married, and needed money. A friend suggested joining the LAPD.<br />Officer Gates learned there were more traffic deaths than homicides in 1950 LA. People got citations because warnings had no deterrence (p.20). The people Gates encountered were no poorer than he had been, but the Gates home was never without hope (p.23). Chapter 3 tells of the corruption in the LAPD before Chief Parker. Gates says Mayor Shaw and the underworld controlled the LAPD (but doesn't speak of the local ruling class). Gates was picked to be Chief Parker's chauffeur, and learned the importance of political support (p.31). Gates also learned of Parker's faults. Chief Parker streamlined the organization, reassigned police by time of day and neighborhood where crimes were committed. Parker instituted pro-active policing, creating the most aggressive police department in the country. Page 36 tells of the power of the 'Los Angeles Times': it elected mayors, and told the City Council how to vote (no mention of the powers behind them). Chapter 5 tells how hard he worked at preparing for exams. Gates came out first for the sergeant's exam, and for every exam afterwards (p.58). Promoted to lieutenant, he rejoined Chief Parker, and became his executive officer (p.65). <br />Promoted to captain, he learned \\"you can't give up on people\\" (p.68). Soon he was in charge of Intelligence. Gates noticed a lackof good protection for JFK in 1963 (pp.73-4). Gates explained the conflict between Chief Parker and J Edgar Hoover (p.76). Mob influence was minimal in LA, compared to Chicago or NY (p.78). There were checks and balances to avoid corruption (p.85). Gates was promoted to inspector in 1965, before the Watts riot. The postwar baby boom led to a huge increase in the number of young people, the predominant age group for criminals (p.105). Gates political skills paid off when he won the biggest pay raise in department history (p.130). The May 1974 incident with the SLA made SWAT famous.<br />\\"People really don't have the freedom to know what is going on in the world, only the freedom to know what the media wants us to know\\" (p.181). Proposition 13 \\"substantially lowered property taxes\\", and Chief Gates came up with a budget cut that avoided layoffs. One of Gates decisions was to allow each officer to choose when to wear a short-sleeved shirt. Gates discusses the two \\"chokeholds\\": one disables, the other can kill (p.214). Page 216 tells how the 'LA Times' misquoted him. Page 242 tells how the FBI tried to gain control of the LAPD. Chapter 19 tells of his efforts for gun-control. Was he angling for a plush job with Gun Control Inc? Or a Federal job with some agency (p.128)? Chapter 20 has some suggestions on fighting crime. The Rodney King beating gave his many enemies a chance to oust him (Chapter 22). Gates boasts of the lower ratio of police to population compared to NY or Chicago. But the places with less population density tend to have less crime. And so do places with \\"the right to keep and bear arms\\". This also made LA different from NY and Chicago. LA also has a lower ratio of pedestrians.	2003-10-21

Seedman of the NYPD, a force second in size to the FBI. The Introduction briefly covers his career, no detective chief had ever left such an imprint. His legend rested on his performance: so many investigations with such originality, intensity, or good results. Seedman obtained his solutions by using his intelligence on the mundane information available in a record-oriented society (p.5), and his eye for fine detail (p.6). In all his years Seedman never fired his weapon in action, the situation had never gotten out of control. Some of these cases were widely publicized, and some were not. (You can read between the lines in some of these stories.)   &#34;The Belt Parkway Case&#34; was solved by detective work; they found a needle in a haystack. &#34;To A Gold Shield&#34; tells of his early life. Seedman tells of a 71-year old Frenchman who picked up dots and dashes by &#34;his inner ear&#34;; I suspect a tooth filling resonant to the frequency. &#34;Brass&#34; tells of his continuing career and promotions. &#34;The Fallon-Finnegan Case&#34; tells of his political knowledge: Seedman would not provide a solution until his own boss was there. &#34;The Johnson-Genovese Case&#34; tells of the detective work that starts immediately after a body is found. People saw the attack on Kitty, but no one called the police (&#34;that late at night they just go back to sleep&#34;). Page 141 tells of the intricate politics of a major arrest. &#34;The Mays Case&#34; tells how a department store was swindled: the mob found an inside man. It describes how organized crime collects its taxes. &#34;The Girls in a Box Case&#34; was solved by relentless investigations, and a seance! &#34;The Melville Case&#34; is about the terrorists who set off bombs in 1969 New York. An undercover FBI informer who previously belonged to the right-wing Minutemen infiltrated their group (&#34;he was full of plots&#34;). Typical agent provocateur?   &#34;The Townhouse Case&#34; tells about the explosion and fire on March 1970 in Greenwich Village. The SDS-Weathermen group were destroyed by their bombs. These rebels were mostly from well-to-do or wealthy families and grew up in the 1950s. &#34;The Jewish Connection&#34; tells of the JDL protest bombs. When Seedman met Kahane he noticed something wrong by the look in his eyes (p.315). Again, an inside informant was developed. Page 323 tells of a plan to use a model airplane to bomb a building. Another plan was to set off a car bomb in an underground garage. An incendiary device filled Sol Hurok's offices with thick black smoke, and a young woman died. &#34;The Colombo Case&#34; tells of their meeting; Seedman wanted help in solving two murders (most mob exterminations go unsolved). Joe Colombo formed the Italian American Civil Rights League to protest discrimination, and picketed FBI headquarters. But Colombo began to lose support from former backers, and the fundraising attracted envy (p.350). Colombo was assassinated at a public rally, and so was the alleged assassin. They were never solved. &#34;The Gallo Case&#34; explains the investigation into the murder of Joey Gallo; he was thought to be responsible for the murder of Joe Colombo. This chapter covers the remainder of Seedman's career. One was the change to &#34;detective specialization&#34; (to even the work load). But Seedman was removed from his position. The year before he accepted a free meal at the NY Hilton (p.464-472). No other wrongs were found, and he was named Chief of Detectives again. Seedman retired in 1972, the last of the Depression-bred generation. The new system had all rules in writing, it was like the other Civil Service jobs.	2003-10-18
938577:US	38002140	R2W8YUF5BIKCXK	0805065377	92302129	Eight Men Out: The Black Sox and the 1919 World Series	Books	5	4	5	N	N	The "Black Sox" Scandal Explained	Eliot Asinof tells the history of the 1919 World Series. Most prior accounts have been fragmentary. No one person knew all the factors; many of the participants never met each other or knew of their existence. Asinof wove together a multitude of threads from the newspapers of that time ('Preface'). Official documents had disappeared, and most participants died before talking. Survivors refused to talk, the gambling gangster world was still around. Sources chose to remain anonymous. Many of the incidents in this book represent a composite of sources. The Introduction says this scandal was not an isolated incident in an otherwise unblemished history of baseball. Comiskey cruelly exploited his peons (like others), but this did not excuse this betrayal of the fans. The April 1919 Federal court decision found Professional Baseball violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Act; this must have impressed the players that year. A later Supreme Court decision overturned this (I wonder what was paid for it?). Perhaps the real scandal of 1919 was that it revealed baseball was a business, not a sport.     Baseball and betting were allied from the beginning, just like other sports (horse racing). Bribery and other tricks were used to fix the results (as in the 1876 pennant series). Baseball was the biggest entertainment business in 1917. When race tracks were shut down during wartime, gamblers and bookies switched to baseball. Gamblers would befriend baseball players with women and whiskey; they could control ball games as readily as horse races. Stories were hushed up for the good of the game. Bribing ball players was known, players had done this to win the pennant in 1917.     The heavy betting on Cincinnati lowered the odds. Rumors spread about the fix. One set of gamblers wanted Chicago to lose, but another set wanted Cincinnati to lose (p.47)! There was a thin line separating effective play from a near miss that helped the other side (p.66). When the gamblers failed to make their payoff after the second game, the White Sox went on to win. (The gamblers had them coming and going.) The gamblers said the series must be ended in the 8th game (p.113). Some people suspected something bad had happened. A pile-up of civil cases followed: all the defendants lost money betting on the White Sox. Accepting bribes now left the players open to blackmail and extortion (p.145). 1920 was a bigger year for gate receipts. The American League President sought to use this scandal against Comiskey. There was hatred among the White Sox players (p.166). Pages 170-1 tell why you should never act without benefit of counsel when questioned by the authorities (p.177). Different newspapers reported Jackson't confession in different ways (p.189). \\"The Front Page\\"? The players would not have betrayed Comiskey unless there was a cause for bitterness. The great national pastime must reflect the society it lived in, the worship of \\"easy money\\".     The Black Sox scandal wounded American pride and self-esteem, the image of nobility and humanity (p.197). While corruption was rampant in state and national legislatures, and show business, could baseball not be corrupt? Yet it foretold the 1920s, a decade of unprecedented crime, corruption, and immorality (p.198). Did America expect higher morals from ball players than from businessmen, or anyone else (p.243)? The ball players were charged with a conspiracy to defraud the public; but they only threw some ball games. The jury found them all not guilty; this kept Professional Baseball clean. The next day the new Baseball Commissioner announced that they would be banned for life (p.273). After you read this book you'll know why popular histories of baseball usually begin around 1921; the preceding 50 years is rarely mentioned.	2003-10-15

It uses Roman numerals for its chapters. The purpose of this book is to educate, and entertain, the reader. Its description of that video reads like a pornographic novel. It warns everyone of the dangers in the on-line world. This book is about a serial murderer who trolled the Web seeking willing victims. There were criminal acts in John Robinson's past before he started on murders. His embezzlements were discovered but did not result in jail time because of his restitutions. Most white-collar criminals are not violent. People trusted him; he could have been a politician. The authors say this is one example why career criminals can't be rehabilitated (p.13). Repeat offenders know how to present themselves (p.14).    JR was born in Cicero Ill in 1943. He became an Eagle Scout at 13, and senior patrol leader; he had a lot of talent. JR then entered the Quigley Preparatory Seminary, but was remembered for shrewdness not academic success. He then attended Morton Junior College, and then worked at West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park Ill. He was accused of embezzlement, but was not prosecuted when he agreed to pay it back. JR then moved to Kansas City with his family (p.8).    One of JR's businesses was hydroponics, a way of growing vegetables indoors. (No weeds?) JR manipulated the Kansas City mayor by creating faked letters from real people; it was discovered (p.31). Page 23 says prisoners who become jailhouse ministers want to exert power and control over others. While bouncing between jobs (fired for embezzling) and scams, JR discovered the new world of personal computers (p.26). He also started a prostitution business, and continued to lead a busy double life. (The authors noted his many escapes, but never mention any links to organized crime.) He attracted the notice of the police and FBI, but nothing happened. (Jack Ruby?) In time, his past crimes caught up to him and he went to jail. JR received an education in computers while in prison. After his release he went back to his old pattern. Women would meet him, then disappear without a trace. The Internet gave him a superhighway to his goals.    The case against JR was tangled and multi-dimensional, involving multiple states and jurisdictions, with financial and computer issues (p.159). (JR may have survived so long because there were no insurance claims as in the case of H.H. Holmes.) Serial killers collect mementos of their victims, evidence that is used in court. JR was extensively surveilled before his arrest (p.163). The authors explain S&M as a way to escape adult responsibility by those who are emotionally vulnerable (p.164). (I once worked with a woman who joined EST so they could tell her what to do.) These seem to be lonely women who befriend strangers. Money and sex were the bait. Communities hate being fooled by those they liked and trusted, their feelings turn to anger and hate. (Does this explain the problem for OJ Simpson?) This can splatter innocent associates (p.194). People think a serial killer should look like a monster, but they look like anybody, even someone who wouldn't hurt a fly (p.211). JR was \\"a clever man with a remarkable ability to appear normal\\" (p.220).     To paraphrase that famous cartoon: \\"on the Internet nobody knows your are a serial murderer\\".	2003-10-08

Chapter 1 tells how promoting resentment of \\"limousine liberals\\" is a trick to distract people from acting in their own best interest. The difference between the two parties is explained (p.18). Page 19 tells of \\"Tricky Dick\\" Nixon's exploitation of class and racial resentments. What's Rush Limbaugh really like (p.23)? Chapter 2 discusses the pranks of Ann Coulter. She seems to have many problems (pp.31-2). Conason refuted the claim of Bernard Goldberg (p.33). Does the claim of \\"liberal bias\\" show an inferiority complex by conservatives? Page 38 tells how Rush Limbaugh was wrong again. Page 40 tells how Editors and Publishers, who control the media, mostly vote conservative, unlike voters at large. Page 42 tells who was responsible for creating the scandalous news about Bill Clinton. Conason compares the lies told about Al Gore to the truth (p.43). The lies told by candidate George W Bush were not exposed (p.45). The audiences overwhelmingly prefer CBS, NBC, and ABC over Fox (p.51). [I think their \\"liberal bias\\" delivers a larger audience to paying advertisers; that is the secret.]<br /><br />Chapter 3 discusses patriotism. Are liberals traitors for upholding democratic rights and civil liberties? Do conservatives think that civil rights only belong to corporations (legal fictions) than real people? Are conservatives hypocrites who criticize adverse comments about President Bush (p.56)? Did conservatives avoid criticizing President Roosevelt (WW II), President Truman (Korea), or President Johnson (Vietnam) (p.57)? Page 59 tells how Rush Limbaugh stayed out of Vietnam - his behind was sore! Pat Buchanan had a \\"bad knee\\" (p.61). Can you believe the excuse of Tom DeLay - they gave his job to a minority (p.67)! Conservatives supported Nazis, the Confederacy, and King George III (pp.70-73).<br />Chapter 4 points out that conservatives imagine they alone understand \\"how the world works\\", and are alone qualified to run the world! This is not science. Reagan's deregulation of Savings & Loan banks lost Hundreds of Billions, and created ongoing expenses (p.76). When Republicans spend billions, Democrats tax to make up these losses. Our Ruling Class uses \\"the two party system\\" to control the people by alternating politics and personalities. This ruling class is composed of bankers, merchants, manufacturers, some of the farmers and middle class. Some benefit from one policy, some from another. Each group gets a chance to profit, an this avoids another Civil War (when Southern Planters rebelled against Northern Bankers, Merchants, and Manufacturers). Clinton's progressive tax increase in 1993 was followed by the greatest prosperity since the 1960s (p.79). Bush's regressive tax policies created the worst depression since Hoover's time. Have we learned a lesson from this? Democratic Presidents excel on: gross domestic product, job creation, unemployment, disposable income, deficit reduction, federal spending, and inflation (p.86).<br />Conason notes the fantasies of conservatives: \\"efficiency of markets\\", the \\"creativity of enterprise\\". Both need government regulation to allow competition to prevail over monopolies. The \\"crony capitalism\\" (p.88) has a long, long history from before Classical Rome, when Caesar got his cut from \\"waste management\\" (pecunium non odium).

The &quot;basic liberal values are political equality and economic opportunity&quot; (p.2). Conason lists all the benefits from the past century of liberalism (p.4), conservatives opposed every one of those advances. Page 5 notes the support for a national health system, but doesn't explain why it is unattainable. Conason mentions &quot;reputable polling&quot; (p.6), but doesn't explain how to distinguish it from polls rigged to provide a predetermined answer. Conason adds together the votes for Democrats and Greens (p.7), but doesn't realize the Greens were designed to split off Democratic votes (Get Republicans Elected Every November). Conason says the word &quot;liberal&quot; has been given negative associations through relentless propaganda (p.8). Yet America has never had a Liberal Party and never will. The word &quot;liberal&quot; now means a scarecrow straw man designed to frighten people via emotion; and it seems to work (p.9). &quot;Who controls the media, controls the thinking; who controls the thinking controls the people&quot; to paraphrase George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;.<br />Why then do some prattle about the &quot;liberal media&quot;? First, it is part of their &quot;argument from ignorance&quot; act. Second, it is part of national censorship. The media is owned and controlled by fewer and fewer corporations. The TRUTH is that it is the &quot;corporate media&quot;, but the talk radio actors can't say this! If you don't believe that, try calling one and ask if the media is owned by large corporations. Will they avoid answering you, even if the call screeners let you talk?	2003-09-30
961060:US	38002140	R22P1HFVR51GR0	0262033038	583611375	From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry (History of Computing)	Books	3	18	21	N	N	Looping through Memories	This is a history of the Software Industry. &quot;Software&quot; was coined to distinguish it from hardware; it describes the spirit that activates electronic machines. There are three sectors: software contracting, corporate software products, and mass-market software products (pp.3-8). The book covers events from around 1950 to 1995 in the USA. Chapter 1 gives an overview of the sources available. Chapter 2 tells of the origins of software writing, and its need for high-maintenance. Could errors arise from &quot;one minor change&quot;? Early users cooperated in sharing software. FORTRAN and COBOL became the first standard programming languages. But high costs and slipped schedules became typical. Government support for SAGE helped establish US dominance of the computer industry (p.48). The &quot;Great Society&quot; led to investments in non-defense projects.<br />Chapter 3 discusses &quot;Programming Services&quot;. The established techniques of engineering management filtered into programming projects. Program flowcharts became institutionalized, then flushed away by the &quot;fad for 'structured programming'&quot; (p.69). The boom for software companies in the late 1960s reminds me of the dot-com fever in the late 1990s. All fueled from government spending (p.75, P.80). The arrival of minicomputers around 1970 allowed middling companies to own a computer. Chapter 4 tells about the change to &quot;Software Products&quot;. Computers were more plentiful and more powerful (pp.90-91), programmers didn't keep up. Lines of code used increased 1000% every 5 years, the cost of developing quadrupled by 1965. Page 100 discusses flowcharting, whose purpose was to graphically represent a program's operations. Sort of like a condensed slide presentation of a topic. Page 102 tells of a secret machine instruction used to improve sorting speed (what was it?).<br />Chapter 5 tells how the software industry acquired its current shape, and gives an overview. Software products was acapital goods business. Industry specific software requires in-depth knowledge; in systems software programming skills are critical. The success of CICS can be compared to a system of roads where applications can freely travel (p.151). Chapter 6 discusses the maturing of corporate software packages, and growth through acquisition. It focuses on three large firms that became prominent in the 1990s. Some grew by acquiring smaller firms for their products (diversification). The rise of the relational database had an adverse affect on older database technologies. The use of fully integrated business application software (ERP) created new companies. Pages 182-4 overviews the successes of Computer Associates. A relational database did not require knowledge of the internal structure of the database; ever faster computers masked its relative inefficiency. Sales of SAP R/3 benefited from the &quot;fad for business re-engineering&quot; (p.195). Page 197 explains why SAP is more important that Microsoft.<br />There are strong parallels with other historical systems, such as railroads to airlines. If the database was bundled with the operating system there would be no independent vendors. European firms were able to pioneer ERP because they not not been locked into &quot;legacy software&quot; (p.199). The remaining chapters discuss the history of the personal computer.	2003-09-27

The &quot;Acknowledgments&quot; lists his sources and references. Chapter 7 reviews the early development of microcomputers. The invention of the microprocessor in 1971 made microcomputers possible (p.201). The Apple II was the transforming event of April 1977. The fall 1979 release of VisiCalc transformed &quot;toy computers&quot; into a useful machine for businesses. Digital Research's CP/M allowed any application to run on any computer that used CP/M; this allowed program vendors to access a larger market. Microsoft eclipsed DR by providing DOS for the IBM PC, and its games and programming languages. PC software was usually sold by mail, then at stores. The invention of VisiCalc is credited as boosting the market for personal computers. Productivity applications drove the software industry in the early 1980s (p.215). Word processing was aimed at home computing; Word Star was the most successful. Most computer games were produced by sole authors, lasted a few months, and made little money.<br />Chapter 8 discusses the now mature PC industry. Why did a few companies succeed where many failed? &quot;The Autodesk File&quot; says: product improvements, complementary products, training networks (p.243). Technical competence does not guarantee success unless it meets user needs (p.244). The need to work with two or more applications simultaneously led to &quot;windowing&quot; (p.247); but this required more time and money than first estimated (p.251). Page 253 tells of the big mistake by Lotus' management in rewriting the program. A similar mistake doomed Word Star (p.255). Ashton-Tate's demise is described on page 257. These were one-product companies. Page 259 explains Microsoft's winning strategy for its Office Suite. Page 264 tells of Symantec's strategy for success.<br />Chapter 9 describes software used for entertainment, and looks at videogames, CD-ROM encyclopedias, and personal finance software. Arcade games replaced older pinball machines during the 1970s. Videogame consoles for the home allowed playing many games. Home computers had a keyboard and secondary storage, and could be programmed by the user. Videogames are similar to recorded music's stream of new titles, and relatively short life. The purpose of a CD-ROM with an encyclopedia was to justify the cost of a computer (p.289). Microsoft's Encarta broke into the 1993 consumer market with multimedia. This coincided with the falling price for CD-ROM drives (p.292), and lowered prices for CD-ROM software. By the early 1990s Quicken was the best selling consumer software product of all time. Its founder entered a crowded field with no track record, an untried product developed by a single programmer (p.295). It was designed to be easy to use, and continually improved. <br />Chapter 10 discusses the success of Silicon Valley, and the economic and physical environment that created its culture (p.303). Hardware companies tended towards success, software companies less so (p.304). The great number of computers in the US created a market for software companies. The prices for their mature products ruled out competitors. This pattern continued to the personal computer age. One effect of manpower training is to create off-shore body shops to benefit US multi-national corporations. Clustering firms in a small geographic area helps, as does Government subsidies (like the Internet). But misdirecting support can hurt rather than help (p.311). [I found Robert X. Cringely's book to be better.]	2003-09-26

The Prologue gives his family history, and why he joined the Mossad. Chapter 1 tells how a NATO sleeper cell was used to create atrocities that could be blamed on Communists, and destabilize the left leaning Belgian government (pp,4-5). Chapter 2 tells how they worked with an American company that had desired technology (p.10). Chapter 4 explains how the Jordanian peace initiative was stopped. In Chapter 6 Victor was kicked out of the Mossad, and immediately recruited into a secret organization. Chapter 8 tells how a new head of the Mossad was stopped from taking office. Chapter 9 tells of his secret mission to the KGB to offer himself as a spy (Chapter 13). This would expose a suspected mole.<br />Chapter 15 explains how Libya was blamed for a discotheque bombing in 1986. The US retaliation kept Libya \\"out of the picture\\". Victor then learns how turmoil was created between Kuwait and Iraq. Chapter 17 describes the safe house system in London. Victor traveled to Jordan to advise them on detecting moles. Chapter 21 tells of \\"humanitarian assistance\\" to blacks in Soweto, using a Baltimore hospital for cover. Were they testing medications and diseases? Victor explains the Pollard affair, why Pollard knew too much. Pollard's information was traded to the Soviets to release Jews; Pollard was used and then flushed! Chapter 22 tells of his visit to Egypt, and their interest in Robert Maxwell. Maxwell bought media to influence public opinion, and to provide a cover for assets in other countries; page 204 tells how this worked.<br />Chapter 23 tells how background information was obtained from strangers (p.208). The Vanunu affair is explained (p.209). In Chapter 25 Victor decides to write his book on the Mossad. Operation Hannibal sold military supplies to Iran. Page 228 tells how Kurt Waldheim was branded as a Nazi! Page 231 explains how a politician was smeared and defeated. When this politician tried to clear himself, he was lured to Geneva and given a heart attack (pp.234-5). In Chapter 26 Victor travels to Paris to tell the French secret service about the Mossad's links with fascist elements (p.242). They later asked Victor to investigate the leading advocate of privatization in the US (p.244). This member of the Libertarian Party sought to destabilize a French South Pacific island.<br />Chapter 27 tells about the propaganda campaign against Saddam Hussein (p.247). Iraq targeted Iranian cities using information from American satellites. Pages 250-1 tell how a reporter (who knew too much) was lured into a fatal mission. Then there is the planted story of Iraq's \\"weapons of mass destruction\\". Page 259 tells of the safest sanctuary around - an airport! Chapter 30 tells of President George Bush's visit to the Madrid peace talks, and the failed assassination attempt. Chapter 31 explains Robert Maxwell's partnership with the Mossad, and why he had to be silenced. It was not that he knew too much, but that he began to talk too much under pressure of bankruptcy. Chapter 31 ends the book with his tour of Europe to promote his first novel. A problem occurred in Belgium; Victor knew of the corruption of the Belgian police force. Victor then realized that his connection in the Mossad was no longer reliable (p.290).and defeated.

The past 35 years allows retrospection on his reports. Agnew and Nixon resigned in disgrace, and much has changed since 1968. Reagan has come and gone, elected past his prime. (\\"I don't know.\\" Chapter 15.) Mailer attended the meetings to give his impression of the candidates and their supporters. Mailer's description of the hot humid air of Miami shows his literary ability and style. I swam through the waves of purple prose until I got seasick. These relentless waves carried my exhausted mind onto the sands of countless words. Mailer's quotes from Nixon's speech shows what a rhetorician Nixon was. Nixon \\"gave one impression and acted upon another\\"; but \\"when his language was examined, one could not call him a liar\\" (Chapter 14). Hence the name \\"Tricky Dick\\".<br />\\"Chicago is the great American city\\"; Mailer explains why. His description of a slaughterhouse again shows his rich literary style. Mailer backed Kennedy; he admired the mixture of idealism and trafficking with the overlords of corruption. Politics is property, you never give away something for nothing. If a politician is his own man, then he is ill-equipped for the game of politics (Chapter 6). Mailer says LBJ controlled the convention via Mayor Daley. It was the bitterest, most violent, disorderly, and uncontrolled in decades. Mailer analyzes the behavior of the candidates: Humphrey, McCarthy, McGovern, and others. Mailer discusses the protesters that came to Chicago, and the many organizations behind them. How many of the protesters were undercover agents? Why was the Democratic Convention a target? Was there manipulation of the protest organizations? Chapter 12 ends by saying the police targeted new photographers to avoid future evidence. Chapter 16 tells of the one-sided battle at Michigan and Balbo Avenues. Chapter 26 tells how Mailer was punched and almost arrested.<br />Mailer's description of the Convention listed many names who have passed from politics into the history books.  Mailer puts a lot of himself into these reports; this is like a magazine article, not a newspaper story.	2003-09-09

While every effort was made to be accurate, names, dates, places, and events were intentionally altered (p.ix). It is about a secret side to our government that is kept hidden, one that is not elected but controls our lives never the less. The book begins with an easy job that promised big money. (Shouldn't this be a warning?) The team is introduced by their talents. The job was to place some monitoring equipment at a rural airstrip, then return. But an ambush occurred, and team members were killed. They cleaned up the mess, and escaped (pp.62-4). When the remaining members of the team met at the rendezvous in Colorado, they were warned against using a cordless or cellular phone.<br />Chapters 9 and 10 tell of his entry into the world of black operations in Thailand, where he was involved in transporting \\"military supplies\\". In Chapter 16 Chance learns these \\"military supplies\\" were opium; this was a forerunner for Iran-Contra drug smuggling. In Chapter 17 Chance found out about the history of his black operations. It was to enrich high-level intelligence operations; they were \\"the biggest drug dealers in the world\\" (p.221). All the surviving team members wanted was to be let alone, and not hassled in other ways (pp.233-4). The Appendix gives examples of coded memos from the CIA, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency (what a great cover name!).<br />A few years before his execution, an excerpt from a letter of Timothy McVeigh was printed in the \\"NY Times'. It said the Federal Government wanted to recruit him for a secret organization that would execute drug dealers and corrupt politicians in this country and abroad. This book corroborates that statement. The book \\"Compromised\\" by Terry Reed tells of higher level drug deals by Government officials. Why were the Spooky 8 teams \\"contaminated with toxic wastes\\"? Because they knew too much, and their continuedemployment presented a future security risk (like that C-5 shot down in 1986 Nicaragua). 1992 was a critical election year. The old saying is still true: \\"if you sup with the Devil be sure to use a long spoon\\".	2003-09-04

Simpson	Books	2	5	32	N	N	Following the Lemmings Over the Cliff	This well written and edited book promises to provide \\"a new understanding ... as well as an insightful examination\\". But like others, Toobin fails to quote the coroner who did the autopsies: \\"the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11pm\\". This chatty, gossipy book begins with the lawyer's meeting of 6/25/1994; Shapiro would go to trial and get an acquittal. The autopsies suggested that more than one killer was involved (p.7). Toobin quickly exposes his prejudice: anyone could see that OJ was guilty because of \\"over whelming evidence\\" (p.10). Toobin claims this resulted from over \\"two years reporting\\", and justifies his opinion as based on the \\"full documentary record of the case\\" (p.11). Toobin claims OJ was not framed (p.12). Read Stephen Singular's \\"Legacy of Deception\\" for a more reliable report.<br /><br />Did lawyer Toobin misinterpret that June 6 letter (p.20)? If OJ let Nicole use his home address that could be a conspiracy to defraud the IRS. Nicole's response was to telephone the Sojourn shelter and claim stalking; then she found a new house on June 10 (p.19). Then some dog wailed in the night. A loose white dog followed a man; he passed it to another couple who followed the dog to the murder scene. The bodies were discovered at midnight. Toobin carefully omits the evidentiary fact that red blood was trickling down the sidewalk. This times the deaths to around 11:30pm. Who failed to call the coroner until nine hours later? Page 71 tells of 'TIME's trickery with the photo, but does not mention darkening the skin color hid the fact that OJ had no bruises or marks on his face! Paula's actions after June 12 were inconsistent with a break-up (p.88). Pages 97-102 discuss OJ's \\"suicide note\\" without telling if he was on a drug like Prozac. Marcia Clark appointed herself prosecutor (pp.114-5). Preliminary hearings record the testimony and facts when the events are fresh; this prevents prosecutors from creating new scenarios from their theories. Toobin failed to mention that witness Jill Shively had no corroboration (p.128). Toobin claimed prosecutors \\"never have the funds to hire jury consultants\\" (p.188). Pages 190-4 tell of the mock juries in LA and Phoenix; they correctly rated the people in the case (p.193)!<br /><br />Toobin described Faye Resnick as having \\"an expensive lifestyle\\" (p.199)! And her book helped the defense (p.201)! Page 220 shows F Lee Bailey's knowledge of the case. Judge Ito belonged to the \\"truth school\\" where the important thing is to protect innocent defendants from being wrongly convicted (p.235). The murders did not fit the pattern of domestic violence (p.237). The 25 to 30 stab wounds on Ron Goldman say he was the real target, and Nicole the innocent bystander (p.238). The Prosecution began with \\"a great edifice built on a foundation of little evidence\\" (p.245). Toobin doesn't believe the murders occurred at 10:15, but later (p.247)! Cochran said \\"this case is a rush to judgment\\", \\"an obsession to win at any cost and by any means necessary\\" (p.250). Pages 272-3 tell of the 10/25/93 tape: OJ, however angry, did not commit domestic violence! Was this a mistake by the Prosecution? Denise Brown's testimony backfired (p.278). Toobin claims Clark's examination of Fuhrman was her biggest miscalculation (p.314). This again demonstrated his prejudice (p.315). Allan Park's testimony was most important; this convince the remaining jurors to vote \\"not guilty\\". Park saw no one enter or leave OJ's residence from 10:22 to 11pm (p.331-2). The gloves that wouldn't fit was the high point of this trial. The recall of Mark Fuhrman served as a deus ex machina to end this show.<br /><br />Toobin would have learned more if he read Stephen Singular's \\"Legacy of Deception\\", and Freed & Briggs \\"Killing Time\\" before writing this book. Clark and Vannatter met on an earlier case, when they found a fingernail sized blood spot under a car seat. I wonder how they discovered what everyone else missed? Not calling the Medical Examiner when the bodies were found caused the loss of relevant facts (the onset of rigor mortis, body cooling).	2003-09-03

Both have experience in politics as a reporter or a candidate. This book notes that the attempted impeachment of President Clinton for extramarital relations is a novel interpretation of the Constitution. First, the Starr persecution for alleged corruption failed; then it was switched to Clinton's private sexual behavior. [Could this be an unpublished perquisite of office?] The publicity in the media suggests a conspiracy, or control by the National Association of Editors and Publishers. Then the Republican Party leaders acted to support their \\"family values\\". Was this Hypocrisy? Do our officials regularly lie to the American people? Does corruption damage our government?<br />This book is about the officials in Congress who were most outspoken about conduct that they have also done. Presidents from Washington to Clinton have lied, and not just about private behavior. Congressmen hide some of their private and public actions. There are about 100 secret rooms in the Capitol for trysting Congressmen (p.15). But Washington has a code of silence that crosses party lines. This applies to marijuana, cocaine, and PCP. If Clinton \\"harassed\\" Paula Jones because of Clinton's official status, what does it say about the Senate and their employees? Newton Gingrich restored the old custom of allowing the House to \\"sleep\\" overnight in their offices.<br />This book has a chapter for: Henry Hyde, Barney Frank, Bill McCollum, Dick Armey, Bob Barr, Joe Biden, David Bonior, Dan Burton, Ken Calvert, Helen Chenoweth, Alfonse D'Amato, Tom DeLay, Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, Alcee Hastings, Orrin Hatch, Kay Baily Hutchinson, Jay Kim, Dennis Kucinich, Bob Livingston, Trent Lott, John McCain, John Mica, Carol Mosely-Braun, Frank Murkowski, John E. Peterson, Chuck Robb, Dan Schaefer, EG (Bud) Shuster, Bob Smith, Gerald BH Solomon, Bob Stump, Strom Thurmond, JC Watts, and David Weldon.<br />The impeachment of Clinton, then Gore, would make Gingrich President. More importantly, we would have passed to a Parliamentary form of government where the legislature is supreme without any Constitutional Amendment. That failed, because in my opinion President Clinton bought enough votes to defeat his impeachment. The authors ask if sexual dalliances would have defeated Washington, Roosevelt, or Kennedy (p.250)? [No mention of Ike, Ford, or Reagan.] Probably the latter two. Washington may not have been different from Franklin, Hamilton, or the others. The real question is: did their policies make life better for the people (p.253)?	2003-08-26

With diversified ownership management became separated from ownership and the scandals began. Greed arises from human nature when there is little control or regulation. The \\"Introduction\\" shows how top management can squander resources when ownership is so diluted that the owners can't control management. If a privately owned company did this, there would be no publicly owned shares that lose value. Borrowed money must be repaid; corporate bonds are preferable to shares. Today's scandals echo those from the Gilded Age. One difference is the lack of small family farms; that Frontier has been closed. The lack of a political party to represent the interests of the common people is shown by the absence of half the voters at the polls.<br />This book does not tell why CEOs were rewarded for failures and losses (p.40). Are stock options deductible business expenses to lower taxes? Does this inflate reported earnings? The accounting scandals resulted from changed rules. The 401K plan was to provide additional retirement income, but many companies are doing away with defined benefit pensions. There is a tax avoidance scam when relocating a corporation offshore (pp.55-8). Arianna's complaints about CEOs in the Bush Administration overlooks past history going back to Washington's day. The function of \\"Chainsaw Al\\" was to purge the mistakes of past management to prevent bankruptcy; senior management keep their hands clean.<br />\\"The Bloodless Coup\\" tells of further oppression of \\"low to middle-class people\\" (p.80). Payoffs or \\"lobbying\\" also goes back to the 1870s and the rise of corporations. Arianna suggests the \\"banquet of greed\\" is a new thing; \\"The Monied Metropolis\\" proves otherwise. \\"Wealth and Democracy\\" shows it going on since the 19th century. Closeness to government power translates to wealth and subsidies, franchises, monopolies, etc. The Glass-Steagal Act regulated investment banks and their analysts; it was gone in the mid 1990s (p.155). Doesn't the Internet stock craze echo the Railroad companies of the 1870s and their Federal Land Grants?<br />New York residents can thank Eliot Spitzer for prosecuting crooks who rob you with a fountain pen (pp.165-7). Page 169 tells how the \\"pump and dump\\" worked at CNBC. The chart on pages 176-181 will help you to learn \\"new speak\\". \\"The Binge and the Reckoning\\" notes the consequences of prior actions. Destroying the regulations from the 1930s led to the 1990s binge (pp.213-4); are we in another Depression? Why were there no reforms passed after the ENRON scandal? The Corporations were against it (p.215)! Page 231 lists some of the likely suspects: Cheney, Corzine, Rubin, White. Their playmates are: Tom Daschle, Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy (p.234). Pages 239-246 list specific corporate reforms that are needed (not ordered by priority). But would the corporations allow their politicians to do this? Page 248 shows what an informed fund manager can accomplish. California stopped investing in corporations that have off-shore tax havens. CALPERS will not use banks that do not separate research from banking (p.253). Using tax credits, incentives, and subsidies for socially conscious companies sounds good, but who will decide (p.255)? Wouldn't this plan aggrandize an already too powerful Imperial Presidency? Two dozen groups involved in \\"political and corporate reform\\" are listed but not rated (pp.259-264).	2003-08-21

These meetings in the summer of 1787 were secret, no official records were kept. But the notes of James Madison and others survived to reconstruct daily events. The original intent of this meeting was to revise the Articles of Confederation (Appendix 1), but a new Constitution resulted (Appendix 2). There is no index.   Many of the basics were the subject of debate and controversy. Some called the result a “miracle” (p.x), but it shows the power of a committee whose members work to the same ends. This book attempts to portray the meetings as an evolving news story, as it was happening. Most Americans do not understand the Constitution, because it is poorly taught in schools from unclear text books (p.xiv). Deliberate obfuscation? These 230 pages are a remedy. This book will give a short introduction into the daily operations of this historically important event.   The Constitution has endured for over 200 years because it is a framework (p.131), not a detailed plan that can’t be adapted to changing situations. The Constitution has endured as long as it is in the interest of “We the People” to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure Domestic Tranquility, provide for the Common Defense, promote the General Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity. The hidden agenda of the convention was to create a strong national government that had veto power over all state laws (May 20). The most important reason was the question of domestic and foreign commerce. Rivalries between the bankers and merchants of the North (for high tariffs) against the planters of the South (for low tariffs) prevented Congress from regulating trade (May 23). Both forces would unite against farmers and the common people, and the danger of too much democracy (May 29). The Convention wanted to avoid the failures of the Articles of Confederation. The Confederacy owed [millions] in debt and needed to find a way to pay off their debts (p.139).   The unlimited powers of the Royal Governors made the delegates fearful of a single executive. The consequences of consolidating power was fatal to ancient republics (June 2). Experience rather than abstract arguments shaped the Convention (July 4). Neither the executive nor the legislature should have absolute power. The big problem was to create a national government that would provide balance between the large and the small states. States would be equally represented in the Senate, the lower House would be directly elected by the people, based on proportion to population. This was the key to creating a new national government (p.110). The Southern states were more numerous and wealthy than the Northern states; their method of computing political representatives won (July 12). The Convention unanimously rejected “wealth” as the basis for representation; they should not fear the growth of population (July 13). The new government would be a compound of national and federal government (July 17). A Supreme Court was established, with lower courts (July 18). A single powerful executive would be elected by the people to control the legislature (July 19). The importance of impeachment was discussed and adopted (July 20). The executive was given a veto (July 21). The Constitution would be ratified by the people, not State Legislatures (July 23). The office of President did not exist under the Confederation (p.133).	2003-08-13

Scarpetta and Captain Marino are then summoned from Richmond to work with the FBI.<br />This book gets up to speed in the first pages, unlike a Hammett or Chandler. The author also tells more of the personal life of the fictional heroine, and her faults. Times have changed.<br />A known serial killer is operating in NYC, and is stalking the police who are searching for him! Quite a change from the usual story. [Is this believable?] The computer used to track killings has a virus in it; this mirrors the real-life serial killer. Scarpetta's niece is involved with this computer system, and is searching for the virus. [Could someone just out of college be hired for this seemingly important job?] The serial killer then plays games in the morgue!<br />Scarpetta locates the serial killer's parents, and learns how they wire money to one location.

This 1957 book of ten essays contains no index. I found some essays thought provoking, others not. “The Essence” is the shortest chapter, and gives a sample of his thoughts. The basic philosophic ideals of Communism, dialectics and materialism, did not originate with Marx and Engels. They can be traced back to ancient Greece: the primacy of matter to Democritus, the reality of change to Heraclitus. Marx wanted to discover the basic laws of society, like Darwin’s laws (p.2). The major flaw of Communism is their belief of sole knowledge of the laws of society, and their sole right to control society. This is a dogmatic religion (p.3). Society and individuals strive to increase and perfect production; this causes conflict with others, and competition to survive. Natural and social barriers must be changed to eliminated. Classes, parties, and political systems are an expression of this ceaseless movement (pp.11 12).   Countries that are exploited for their raw materials and cheap labor must create a revolutionary movement to free themselves from foreign domination (p.16). Revolutions occur when the old political system is an obstacle to new economic or social relationships (p.18). They lead to political democracy and a freer production of goods (p.19). Djilas says the industrialization which followed the Russian Revolution was responsible for their success; defeat in war was a necessary precondition (p.22). Other revolutions offered greater legal security and civil rights (p.27). While the people are used to win a revolution, the ultimate benefits flow to the new ruling class (p.27). Djilas calls them “a new class” because they came to power to establish a new economic order, not after the new economy existed (p.38). Communists were more powerful than any other class because of their unity of belief and disciplines members (p.39).   Every ruling class justifiesits rule as benefiting the ruled by preventing chaos and ruin (p.59). Party ideological unity is the basis for personal dictatorship, and strengthens it. It abolishes democracy, and makes ideas follow personal power. Ideological unity becomes prejudice (p.77). Djilas imagines a “lawful state” where the judiciary would be independent of the government (p.88). [Can that ever be?] Communists use elections and a parliament to provide a display of legitimacy for the public. Their parliaments approve that which was decided for them (p.94). Laws are issued without considering the real situations and practicalities (p.95). [Like in some states?]   Djilas notes the development of heavy industry prevented the USSR from being conquered by Hitler, but he claims this wasn’t important (p.116)! A once backward Russia attained second place in world production in its most important branches of the economy, and became the mightiest continental power (p.117). “Every ideology, every opinion, tries to represent itself as the only true one and complete one. This is innate to man’s thinking” (p.124). Djilas quotes a poet to compare Calvin to Stalin as to dogmatic intolerance (pp.130 1).    Djilas essay “The Aim and the Means” tells me he enjoyed being a revolutionary, but did not enjoy life after the revolution. Its like those who look back to their years in college or the military and not the following decades. Page 158 compares the party purges to those of Imperial Rome or Renaissance times. Could these purges be like fashion: some are in, some are out? Or like high school cliques? The United States is carrying out nationalization not by changing ownership, but by putting more national income into government hands (p.199).	2003-07-30

He soon learned that &#34;the government and the military had to deceive the American public to accomplish its national security objectives&#34; (p.18)! The CIA relied extensively upon Air America to conduct their unstated objectives (p.20). What happened to our MIAs? POW camps were bombed by the Air Force (p.22)! The newspapers and government lied about Southeast Asia (p.23). After leaving the Air Force TKR got a commercial pilot's license and worked as a salesman in the machine industry. TKR became an asset for the FBI, then the CIA, on international sales. In 1983 he began to work for the CIA. &#34;Insurance losses&#34; would be used to raise untraceable funds (p.43). What happened to those old traditional values (p.14)?   A NJ arms company was bought and shipped to Arkansas to build receiver housings that converted a civilian AR-15 to a military M-16, and had no tracable serial number. The Rose Law Firm's specialty was brokering deals (p.55). Governor Bill Clinton was disliked because of his attempts to attract out-of-state businesses, and for trying to improve the state educational system (p.56). Page 86 explains how stolen aircraft are laundered if you have Government connections. Mena airport specialized in illegal modifications to aircraft. Barry Seal was used by the Reagan Administration, then thrown away (pp.97-98). Payoffs were made to Arkansas state officials (p.125). The CIA is above the law (p.133). Pages 212-4 tell how the Arkansas governor's friends and relatives were dirtied-up. Does the CIA decide who will become President (pp.231-6)? The BCCI and First American Bank were used by Arkansas banking (p.245). When dirty money is deposited in the Netherlands Antilles, it can be laundered and taxes avoided (p.249). Things went well for TKR until a C-123 was shot down (pp.289-90).   The Mexican Enterprise began Phase 2. The elite of Mexico, like in Arkansas, opposed any change unless they personally benefited. They suppressed any attempt to empower a middle class(p.330). Then TKR discovered his business was being used to ship pure cocaine to the States; the US Govt. was the biggest cocaine smuggler (p.343)! What powerful men owed their fortune to CIA drug traffic (p.346)? Was the crew on that downed C-123 killed before the crash (p.356)? Page 390 tells how a false crime can be created to destroy the credibility of a witness. The Reeds went underground with hidden identities, and traveled the country.   After the case went to trial, the judge declared Terry Reed not guilty due to a lack of evidence (p.459). This kept the story of drug trafficking hidden from the public. The Reeds tried to sue for their false prosecution, but no lawyer would take their case after the judgment against the Christic Institute (p.470). A famous legal expert took their case on contingency. Page 502 tells of the smear story created by 'TIME' magazine. Iran-Contra was not an issue in the 1992 election because both Bush and Clinton were involved! Terry Reed discovered the CIA counsel was now Attorney-General!   The Epilogue claims the Dept of Justice perverted itself under Reagan, Bush, and Clinton. I think Bush picked Clinton as an opponent because Clinton would not prosecute Bush for drug trafficking; then Bush Jr to continue the cover-up. Congress failed to expose Iran-Contra (p.545) because of a pay-off. (Like the Senate failure to impeach Clinton?) The book ends by asking why Barry Seal was bumped off. Did he threaten very powerful people with exposure? Page 240 tells how dirty drug money ended up in Attorney-General Meese's personal bank account. Do these 'Black Operation' flights still continue?	2003-07-25

Does the spiraling crime rate result from private gun ownership? The reality is that areas with the least private gun ownership have the most crime and murders (Washington DC, New York city, Detroit Mich). The corporate controlled media simply lie, or tell half-truths, to promote the interests of the economic aristocrats who own them. You can read other books on this subject, like William Weir's \\"A Well-Regulated Militia: the Battle Over Gun Control\\".<br />Chapter 2 says that gun ownership would be mandatory if the right to keep and bear arms was interpreted like the other amendments (p.12). In fact, that was the law in 18th and 19th century America. You either showed up with your gun for the monthly militia muster, or paid a fine. Could an armed populace defeat a tyranny? It happened in 1781 America, and in Afghanistan, Vietnam, Indochina, China, Cuba, Nicaragua, Algeria, Angola, Ireland, Israel, Mozambique, Yugoslavia, and Zimbabwe (p.20). Read your newspaper for current events. An armed people could not prevent an invasion but would give the invaders holy hell. Chapter 3 mentions that the use of guns is a common and effective deterrent to crime, but rarely reported in the corporate media (its not fit to print?). Chapter 4 explains why concealed firearms will protect the public. Florida's 1987 \\"right to carry\\" law was followed by a lowered crime rate. Chapter 5 tells why a \\"waiting period\\" didn't work in California, or anyplace else (p.42)! <br />Chapter 6 explains the \\"bait and switch\\" tactics used by the corporate media to attack people's rights just because guns started to used plastic in place of wood (automobiles, another deadly weapon, did this ages ago). Chapter 7 compares guns to vehicles. Everyone with a driver's license could buy one, and schools would teach their use. Every town would have one or more stores! Chapter 8 is on \\"Guns for Cash\\": this program has not lowered the number of murders anywhere its been tried. Chapter 9 tells of political chicanery by the Governor of Colorado after gang warfare broke out (pp.75-76). More children die from accidental drownings, bicycles, skate boards, automobiles, or medications than from shootings (p.81).<br />Chapter 10 explains why the hidden agenda of the \\"Brady Bill\\" is to disarm the people through registration, licensing, gun bans, and taxes. \\"Gun Control\\" groups will tell any lie to fool the voters. Registration leads to confiscation (pp.92-93). Chapter 11 tells of the growing realization by more people to defend their civil rights. Pages 100-101 tell of the ABA's policy dispute with the NRA. Gerry Spence says the ABA speaks for corporate interests, not the people. Chapter 12 gives examples on how dangerous convicts are released to terrorize the people. Isn't this a new way to oppress and distract the people? When people are in fear they can't realize how their government manipulates them. Does this result in a lower voter turnout?<br />This book is worth reading, even if you don't agree with all of it. My complaint about this book is its echo of the solution of the Gun Prohibitionists: pass more laws to create a better society. What is really needed is \\"good jobs at good wages\\"; prosperous people rarely commit violent crimes. That and stable neighborhoods (as in small towns).	2003-07-16

Doesn't this reflect prosperity versus poverty? Wasn't Hubert Humphrey's policy \\"good jobs at good wages\\"? Clancy notes that the result of Prohibition was to enrich organized crime and increase criminal activity (p.xv). Could this have been a hidden agenda?<br />This 1994 book claims to provide a concise reference to refute gun control arguments. It does not provide \\"opposing viewpoints\\". But the paid professionals who promote gun control policies use emotion, not reason. Their background is in advertising, public relations, or an allied field. They use fear and ignorance to drive away rational thought. The same techniques used to sell cigarettes, SUVs, and other higher-priced commodities. I once met a woman who was convinced that \\"childproof guns\\" were needed to prevent her 4 year old child from being shot. But she had no gun in her home! She also drove an SUV (for \\"safety\\") but worried about the reports of their dangers. You can't reason with anyone who has been conditioned to fear an inanimate object they they don't own. Telling her that most of the \\"children\\" who are shot are 15 to 17 year olds who are used by drug dealers didn't make any effect. She believed what she read in a weekly newsmagazine!<br />Chapter 2 discusses \\"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\", which goes back to Colonial times. The newly powerful corporate class began to attack the traditional \\"well-regulated militia\\" in 1877 Pittsburgh. The campaign against the right to keep and bear arms still continues by these economic aristocrats, often hidden behind fronts like the Open Society Institute, the Joyce Foundation, etc. A \\"well-regulated militia\\" was composed of all eligible males, who had to show up for the monthly muster with their arms. Most importantly, they elected their own officers for a one year term. They provided the armed support for the civil authorities, and provided a \\"check and balance\\" against unpopular laws (like the attempt to enforce Prohibition in 1890s S. Carolina). Since the militia could not be sent out of state, this was a drawback to a newly imperial national government. The National Guard was invented as a select militia (of the well-to-do) and used as \\"white collar soldiers\\" in strike-breaking, etc. The \\"well-regulated militia\\" was attacked and eliminated by various state and federal laws from 1877 to 1934. These important facts are not in this book. (You can read \\"The Minuteman\\" by Gary Hart.)<br />Starting in 1934 the corporate ruling class then began to attack the right to keep and bear arms on the national level. Some states had already copied NY's Sullivan Law. They adopted the usual tactics of prohibition by banning the least-used arms. World War II intervened in this campaign. But in the mid 1960s the increasingly powerful corporate class passed the 1968 Gun Control Act, and other bans later. James Madison said Americans had the right and the advantage of being armed, unlike other countries whose rulers feared their people (p.8). Who do you trust?	2003-07-14

Kennedy: An Investigation of Motive, Means, and Opportunity	Books	4	13	19	N	N	Motive, Means, and Opportunity	The author of this very readable book has specialized in reporting on organized crime since 1974. He re-investigated the assassination in 1987, and began to accumulate evidence from the police investigators. Robert Francis Kennedy earned a reputation as an enemy of mobsters and labor racketeers while chief counsel of the Senate Rackets Committee (p.17). No one has ever prosecuted organized crime more than RFK did while Attorney General.<br />June 4, 1968 was primary day in California. At first RFK was trailing, then he and his friends went to the Ambassador Hotel to await results. When the results showed RFK ahead, he went to the Embassy Room to make his victory speech. They then retraced the same route to return to the hotel suite. Sirhan was able to get into the kitchen although he didn't belong there. When RFK walked there, Sirhan opened fire. None of those shot admitted to seeing the gunman (p.43)!<br />Pages 85-89 discuss the 8 shots, and the other five victims. RFK was shot from a gun at his right rear side angled upwards, not from his front at 1 to 3 feet away. The fatal wound behind his right ear came from a one inch distance. There are discrepancies between the testimony of the eyewitnesses and the coroner's analysis from the autopsy (p.91). This is critical evidence (pp.95-98). The history of Sirhan is on pages 101-109. Two weeks after the shooting Sirhan was represented by a lawyer who formerly represented mobsters (p.116). The Defense and the Prosecution agreed to a guilty plea and a life sentence (p.120). The judge wouldn't allow this. Sirhan was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death (p.123).<br />The next month the 'Los Angeles Free Press' printed an article that cast doubt on the official theory (p.13). Extra bullet holes suggested a second gunman. There was a discrepancy between eyewitness testimony and the muzzle distance. A criminalist and firearms expert disputed the claim of a lone gunman (pp.138-9). The Coroner said there was no eyewitness to testify Sirhan fired at point-blank range (p.159). The American Academy of Forensic Sciences recommended a re-examination of the physical evidence (p.170). A court-authorized study concluded the original bullets were matches, but could not be matched to Sirhan's gun (p.175)! Note 123 tells about the traces of wood found on spent bullets in Sirhan's car (p.176). Chapter 19 says the case was badly mishandled by the LAPD in regard to physical evidence (p.192). There was a report of removing two bullets from a strip of molding (p.263). A former FBI special agent said he saw two bullet holes in the center divider (p.269).<br />A polygraph test was administered to the guard; he passed and could not have been involved (p.290). DEM interviewed Sirhan\\" he doesn't remember the shooting, only what happened after (p.299).<br />What really happened? \\"Complicated investigations sometimes have very simple solutions\\" (p.305). DEM thinks the LAPD and FBI erred in not thoroughly investigating organized crime as a possibility; they had the strongest motive, means, and opportunity (p.307). Chapter 30 provides his answer: Sirhan alone did it. DEM acknowledges the LAPD's error of omissions, and tries to explain the discrepancies between the eyewitnesses and the physical evidence.

The 1991 Gulf War destroyed many of the military weapons of Iraq, which were previously bought from the same Western powers. This eventually led to their conquest in 2003, and a return to their former colonial status. The book would be better with a chapter on Iraqi history from the 19th century, and a map showing the surrounding countries. Iraqi's oil resources are almost equal to Saudi Arabia (p.337). <br />Around 1976 the USSR put an embargo on arms delivery to Iraq (p.x). This created a market for France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Australia, and the United States to sell tanks, jet fighters, chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, and nuclear supplies. KRT interviewed dozens of weapon designers, technicians, military trainers, intelligence analysts, diplomats, and other government officials for their information.<br />There is a map of &quot;Iraqi Weapons Plants&quot; (p.xiv) that shows nine CBW facilities and nine nuclear sites. Were any found in 2003 after this book was printed?<br />Chapter 1 gives a short history of Iraq from the 1950s through 1974. Saddam was an important figure during these political conflicts. The triumph of the Baath Party led to improved living standards for the Iraqi people (p.15). Chapter 2 tells how Saddam reversed the danger from the Kurdish revolt. After territorial concessions to the Shah of Iran, the Iranians stopped supplying arms to the Kurds, who were soon defeated. This convinced Iraq to not just acquire weapons, but the means to repair and rebuild them. Both France and Iraq sought to escape control by the superpowers. Iraq began to manufacture toluene (for TNT) and ethylene (for rocket fuel or mustard gas). Other contracts were for a new airport, subway system, telecommunications grid, nuclear plants, railroad lines, naval yards, radio and television broadcasting systems, etc (p.39). Yugoslavia, Brazil, and Egypt were very competitive in advanced technology (p.42). France got a contract to maintain Soviet equipment (p.46). When America and Britain turned down a pesticide plant, Belgium agreed to build a fertilizer plant (p.51).<br />The rest of the book covers the events from 1979 (the overthrow of the Shah of Iran) to just before the Gulf War of 1991. The Epilogue asks &quot;how to prevent another Iraq?&quot;. Or perhaps another third world country that wants to better itself and compete with first world countries? The 20th century has seen the decay and impoverishment of South American countries, and the rise of China and India. The solution seems to be keeping smaller countries disarmed and poor. If the Bankers can't do it, then the Military must. Invading a small country to collect debts for bankers is an old practice.<br />Iraq is faced with the enmity of a larger Iran to its east, and a powerful Turkey to its north. Both were former conquerors of Arabia. The other Arab states are disunited and give little support. The previous colonization of Iraq lasted from 1919 to 1958 under Britain; what's next?	2003-07-09

Information is anything you didn't already know. Noise is unwanted information. Information is received through out senses; some people have more sense than others. Predators seek prey, prey avoids predators. Communication is sending messages between living organisms. Humans use speech and writing (or painting, etc.) to communicate. Telecommunications go back thousands of years, to lanterns, semaphores, and smoke signals. \\"one if by land, two if by sea.\\" Nowadays it refers to the use of electricity, and it has had a profound effect on the modern world.<br />Part One tells about Analog Telecommunications. It explains modulation, encoding, bandwidth, and noise. Electricity flows in a circuit, and can be pulsed (the electric telegraph used the Morse code). The telephone uses electricity to generate sound waves. Speech is mostly frequency modulation. Wires are required to communicate. Radio uses electromagnetic waves to communicate.<br />Part Two tells about Digital Telecommunicatons. It uses the on or off state to send digital data, which can be encoded analog signals (like the teleprinter). Digital data is less subject to errors and degradation in transmission. The binary numbering system uses 0s and 1s to represent larger numbers. Binary information follows standard representations. Compact discs use digital numbers to store and replay analog sound. Error correcting codes result in high reliability. The advantage in future digital communication systems is the potential to be interactive. The book's prediction of ISDN usage has not materialized so far.	2003-07-07

It is about Oswald's relations with the intelligence services of 3 nations. The book starts with the defection of Nosenko (Jan 1964) who personally oversaw the KGB file on Oswald (p.7). Nosenko claimed that radar operator Oswald was never debriefed, and of no interest to the KGB (p.8); this story had problems (p.10). The CIA prepared 44 questions to clarify Nosenko's story, but the FBI refused to allow them (p.21). Marina's statements were accepted (p.24). Were her stories accepted because they told what the Govt. wanted to hear (p.42)? Pages 37-7 tell of Nosenko's deceptions, and failing a lie-detector test. But stress reactions measure other emotions besides lying; the Soviet Union did not use lie detectors, the CIA didn't rely on them (p.38). Nosenko's memory proved faulty. This didn't matter: the Warren Commission wanted a \\"lone gunman\\" verdict.<br /><br />Chapter I tells of Oswald's youth. His favorite program was 'I Led Three Lives for the FBI\\", his ambition was to join the Marine Corps (p.59). He was elected president of his 8th grade class, his intelligence was above average. But schooling in NY city gave him Karl Marx as a hero (p.60)! Oswald joined the Marines, took the Radar Operator's course, and was sent to Atsugi where the CIA's U-2 was flown. Oswald minded his business and did his job well (p.68); he would travel to Tokyo on a 48-hour pass and keep it a secret (p.71). Oswald romanced a high-class hostess and brought her to the base. \\"There was nothing dumb about Oswald\\" (p.82). After he left the Marines he went to Moscow; someone there told him \\"the USSR is only great in literature\\" [fiction?] and he should go back home (p.106). Oswald was sent to Minsk, and again advised to go back home (p.108). Oswald learned more about \\"The New Class\\" and the reality behind the fiction. Pages 110-1 analyze Oswald's diary, and why it was fabricated. Page 137 wonders about Lee's marriage to Marina; but don't girls with an unhappy life at home marry the first chance they get? Oswald's changing statements when preparing his return are analyzed (p.153).<br /><br />Book Three introduces George De Mohrenschildt, who made arrangements in October 1962 to move the Oswalds to Dallas from Fort Worth (p.189). (You wonder who was in control then?) Page 212 claims Oswald took a shot at General Walker, but presents no physical evidence. Oswald's' activities portrayed him as pro-Castro (p.229).<br /><br />Other sources said Oswald had David Ferrie's library card in his possession; there is no mention in this book.

This first book was about her early life in the Big Woods of Wisconsin. Later, her second book was about her family's move to the virgin prairies. Like other Americans, then or now, her family moved to a seeming better life. But others stayed to live where their grandfather's grandfather resided. This book teaches the importance to children in obeying their parents, and what can happen if they don't. Her second book shows an improvement over her first.<br />This book presents a simple life that has disappeared beneath asphalt roads. Many Americans still raise their own crops, milk cows, feed and slaughter pigs, and hunt for food. But what has changed is the decreasing number of owner-operated small holders, and the increasing number of corporate agricultural factories. Few want to return to the olden days of constant manual labor, although the Amish continue to thrive on their lands.<br />I hope her books will continue to be read long after the fantasies of JK Rowlings are as forgotten as those of Horatio Alger, or those Wild West stories popular when Laura was alive.	2003-06-30

Katherine DeWitt is a writer and editor. They claim other writers on this topic lacked legal knowledge and knew nothing of forensic science (p.ix). The writers were jurors who applied common sense and general knowledge to a problem. The authors research led them to a theory previously buried.<br />Joe Kennedy Sr. was not a common bootlegger during Prohibition (p.3); he made another fortune by holding import licenses for Scotch whiskies. He had made several fortunes in banking, shipbuilding, and stock brokering earlier. Like some other bankers, he supported FDR in 1932 and was given the Ambassadorship to Great Britain. Kennedy's defeatist attitude killed his political career, but his sons were ready to be all they could be. Pages 6-8 summarize Ted Kennedy's life. Ted did well as a Senator; he was a team player. Like most Senators and Congressmen, he worked in his car while someone else drove. Ted relied on other people's talents (p.10). Chapter 2 tells of Mary Jo Kopechne. No one has ever proven any irregularities in her life (p.18). The July 1969 party was at Chappaquiddick so Teddy couldn't miss it (p.20). Mary Jo didn't feel well and asked Ted to drive her to her motel. Ted made a wrong turn and ended up on the wooden bridge.<br />After Ted returned to Hyannis Port he was examined by a doctor (p.47). The retrograde amnesia and current confusion was diagnosed as a concussion, acute cervical strain. Ted still walked around in a daze on Monday (p.51). Ted and Joan attended Mary Jo's funeral on Tuesday. On Friday Ted plead guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. Ted's candidacy for a higher office was the other victim of this accident.<br />Chapter 5 discusses various theories about this event. Retrograde amnesia always occurs with a concussion, and explains anyone's loss of memory (p.73). Page 117 suggests they did not report the accident immediately because of Ted'sconfused mental state. A tearful, emotional Ted would have ended his career. This is as good a theory as any (p.123), and avoids multiplying suppositions. Chapter 7 discusses the rumors of Ted's guilt. There was nothing wrong with a closed inquest because Mass. always did it that way (p.159). This can prevent prejudicial pre-trial publicity. Pages 160-2 explain why Ted Kennedy did NOT \\"get away with it\\".<br />Ted Kennedy has continued to get re-elected Senator, but has no chance for higher office. This is described as due to a \\"flaw in judgment\\". Would a drunkard and adulterer make a good President? The authors imply \\"no\\" but the history books (or the present?) suggest at least a \\"maybe\\". They ask if Nixon deserved to be hounded out of office for a \\"third-rate burglary\\" (p.166)? Yes, if \\"Watergate\\" was a cover story for the attempted assassination of George Wallace.<br />Edgartown was the locale for filming \\"Jaws\\" in 1974.

Margaret West graduated from the California Culinary Academy, is a former chef, and provided the recipes in Appendix A. This book is not intended as a substitute for medical advice. It is information offered to help the reader in a quest for optimal well-being. There is no \\"magic pill\\" to reduce excess body fat. This book suggests a diet to control insulin will reduce obesity and make weight loss permanent.<br />Why are so many Americans overweight, and this number increasing every year? Probably because of driving more, and walking less (the zoning laws). In one way overweight is better than famine; too much of a good thing IS a bad thing, or at least has a trade-off. Is a person predestined to be overweight? Or to squander money or time? Not if they learn to act in their own best interest, and reject the lies of advertising (p.11).<br />Obesity used to be a problem of middle age (p.4). But now it attacks our youth (less walking and more sitting and watching). Caloric intake has decreased by 10% since 1900 (p.5), but obesity has more than doubled! This book may explain why maintaining your desired weight seems so difficult. Weight alone is NOT a reliable indicator of health (p.6)! The obese are subject to \\"intense prejudice and discrimination\\". In past ages portliness was associated with prosperity; thinness equaled poverty. This prejudice may be a sign of \\"human error\\", where many people are always looking to put down others to make themselves feel better. Does thinness recall a lost childhood?<br />One feature of this book is the debunking of those Met Life weight tables (p.13) which had nothing to do with health, or the ratio of lean to fat tissue! Some dieting styles are genetically and biologically wrong, no matter how many articles and books repeat them. There are three principles to consider: 1) if you are/were overweight you will have a tendency to be fat; 2)almost everything you read in the corporate-controlled  media about nutrition and diets is wrong, guaranteed; and 3) it is possible to lose weight permanently.<br />The secret is to NEVER go on a diet again. It will ruin your health and make you fat! you must eat real food and balance proteins, carbohydrates, and fat. You need a gentle exercise program several times a week. Chapter 2 explains why common diet strategies fail. Diets lead to metabolic imbalances in your body that guarantees eventually gaining back any lost weight (p.24). Dieting, or starving, results in binge eating (p.32). Eating a high-protein breakfast can control binge eating.<br />There is the critique of the \\"politically correct\\" diet of high-carbohydrate vegetables and grain (pp.34-42). The problem of the low-fat diet is on pages 42-54. Fats are an essential part of a diet, but some eat too much. Fried foods from fast-food restaurants are the most dangerous foods you can eat (p.46). Pages 54-56 tell of the problem with a too-high protein diet. The problem of a herbal diet is discussed on pages 56-60; they are not safe! The facts in this book make it recommended reading for everyone!	2003-06-25

It adjusts past reality to fit present needs and future hopes. MD says human relationships are more important than dry facts. He used his personal experiences to describe Stalin's enigmatic personality. How many others knew Stalin as an ally, became an enemy, and lived to write about it?<br />Wartime events led to misunderstandings with Moscow; they didn't realize that the resistance to the German and Italian invasion and occupation went on together with a domestic revolution. The latter caused friction with Great Britain (p.8). Moscow did not comprehend the fact that the Yugoslav Partisans grew into a regular army; Russian partisans were an auxiliary to their army. Tito's policy was to first look after their army and people, as in arranging an exchange of prisoners (p.10). The next was to form a new provisional government. While acting in their own interests, they followed the lead of Moscow (p.11). Djilas says their idolatry of Stalin resulted in an irrational acceptance of \\"unpleasant facts\\" (p.12). Djilas noted that Stalin's style was colorless, meager, and a jumble of vulgar journalism and the Bible (an ex-seminarian). Perhaps their hero worship was due to their need for a hero in their struggle against foreign and domestic enemies? Stalin's prediction of war's end in 1942 may have been a threat of a separate peace if no Second Front occurred.<br />In 1944 a delegation was sent to Moscow (p.13). It had a balanced ticket: General Terzich, Party leader Djilas, a financial expert, atomic physicist Savich, a sculptor.Djilas had never been to Russia and was not tainted with any \\"factional or deviationist past\\". They hoped to be recognized as the provisional legal government. Yugoslavia was famous in Russia for their 1941 revolt (p.43). Djilas' article were severely edited; were they afraid of a plain language code (p.44)? Stalin's army purgesremoved the incompetent and promoted younger and talented men (p.50). One day Djilas was told of an important matter; once in the car he is told he will meet Stalin (p.57). Stalin was of small stature and ungainly, with the white face of an office worker (p.61). Stalin spoke Russian well, but with an accent; he had a real knowledge of political history. Stalin had a sense of humor, and was very close to Molotov. Stalin spoke of 'Russia\\", not the 'Soviet Union'. While Stalin did not promise to recognize the National Committee as the provisional Yugoslav government, that was his favor. Stalin agreed to give military aid, but said an air base in Italy would be needed; it was soon established (p.64). After the Red Army reached Yugoslavia supplies came by land. Stalin warned Djilas of English duplicity, using the example of General Sikorski's plane crash (p.73). This may have decided Tito's flight to Rumania in 9/21/1944.<br />\\"Life is no respecter of desires or designs, but imposes patterns which no one is capable of foreseeing\\" (p.104). The \\"cult of the personality\\" caused this leader to disregard the changing needs and desires or others (p.106). (Another argument for term limits?) Stalin's behavior was no different from a tsar or hereditary king; Djilas expected better. Djilas writes a flattering description of Khrushchev, who was then in power (p.119-120). \\"No one can take freedom from another without losing his own\\" (p.133). Is this a principle or just empty rhetoric?	2003-06-23

Moreno    This very readable book faces the uncomfortable reality of using humans for medical experiments. Government secrecy is corrosive to democracy, and is a true threat to our way of life. The use of human guinea pigs shows something rotten at the heart of society's political rulers.     Chapter 5 tells about radiation experiments. There was a need to study the health risks from inhalation or ingestion to determine the toxic levels. Releasing radioactive products into the air was part of deliberate policy that occurred hundreds of times (pp.153-4). Chapter 6 tells how the Nuremberg Code was adopted for testing ABC weapons (p.166). This rule prevailed in the civilian hierarchy but lacked traction in the military medical culture (p.184); this reflected the political struggles (p.187). Chapter 7 tells of the experiments with hallucinogens as a military secret weapon during WW II (pp.190-1), and afterwards. The Blauer Case tells how state hospitals' experiments killed patients (pp.194-8)! Scanty record keeping on atomic bomb explosions was continued with Agent Orange in Vietnam (p.206). The known dangers from uranium mines were disregarded by the AEC (p.221). Uranium miners fate was to die in their forties for reasons of national security (p.226). After Nuremberg, only America among Western countries experimented on prisoners (p.230).     Chapter 8 tells of the attacks on the Nuremberg Code rules. Pages 252-3 tell why it is legal to experiment on members of the Armed Forces: the Supreme Court said so! Nerve gas experiments were suspended in 1969 (p.263). President Nixon asked for the ratification of the 1925 Geneva Accord to prohibit the first use of biological and chemical weapons. The1977 Senate hearings on the biological testing program resulted in new ethics of research for government agencies (p.265). Chapter 9 tells of the 1991 Gulf War aftermath: many veterans reported illnesses. One explanation was the drug alleged to protect our soldiers caused this problem. PB was never tested or approved, so its use was reckless and a poor experiment (p.269). Pyridostigmine bromide was never approved against chemical weapons (p.270). The FDA created an exceptional \\"Rule 23(d)\\". Did PB react with organophosphates to create harm (p.272)? The lack of records prevents any investigation. The last section on '91 Bravo' reads like a very optimistic and cheerful ending to this story.	2003-06-05

Moreno    Calling chemical warfare \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" is misleading since they are more limited than atomic or biological weapons. Biological weapons can turn against their users. Only atomic weapons have enormous destructive capacity (p.xv). The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation documented secret experiments on humans from WW II to the present day. Biological warfare goes back to ancient times: placing decaying bodies into a water supply or launching them into a besieged fort. There is much more known about biological and chemical weapons today than before 1992. Government secrecy is corrosive to democracy, and is a true threat to our way of life. The use of human guinea pigs shows something rotten at the heart of society's political rulers. This very readable book faces the uncomfortable reality of using humans for medical experiments.     Bacteria and chemicals are hard to control and deliver effectively but relatively cheap to produce and transport. Testing on humans has a long international history, as is hiding these facts (p.4). The Nazi doctors trial at Nuremberg set a standard for military-medical human experiments. Hundreds of other doctors were never tried. A \\"crime against humanity\\" was defined as the reckless pursuit of scientific knowledge, or sheer sadism. Experiments on humans predated the Nazis; in 1931 the powerful chemical manufacturers were caught using patients in hospitals (p.64). Then there was America's own wartime research (pp. 65-6). But America was not riddled with a hate-mongering pathology that permitted the systematic injury of certain groups of humans (p.79).     Chapter 4 tells of Nazi scientists brought to America because of their expertise. They now used American soldiers rather than concentration camp victims (p.89)! Similar experiments were done by Japanese Unit 731 (pp.103-7). Their history was kept secret to protect Army biological weapon testing at Fort Detrick, whose budget was second to the Manhattan project (p.109). The US military wanted this information on crop destruction and human experiments. A Soviet war crimes trial documented these facts (p.111-4). Germ warfare charges in Korea and China are discussed on pages 115-6.	2003-06-04

He researched various books to present a new look at old history. Where could these mistakes come from? Perhaps it comes from the official history books selected by the Boards of Education. Some from entertainments passed off as history. There is always the need to present old history to &quot;prove&quot; the correctness of current politics. If reading opposing viewpoints educates you, read this entertaining book and become a little wiser.<br />Chapter 1 is on 'Patriotism'. Our national flag was rarely in use until after the War for the Union. Troops used regimental colors or state flags. The Pledge of Allegiance was created in 1892. Shenkman seems to not understand the phrase &quot;our flag was still there&quot; (p.8). The meaning to me is whether Fort McHenry was captured. Using lyrics from a song about drinking and loving would not be objectionable to 19th century military (p.9). Chapter 2 is on 'Religion'. Shenkman corrects the misinformation spread by corporate advertising. The fact that church membership (and the right to vote - p.25) was limited suggests churches operated as a ruling class and limited its membership by choice (p.23). Page 29 tells how Madison and Jefferson refused public prayers. Lincoln was the first president to affirm the usefulness of religion in politics. Lincoln was never baptized and never a member of any church; he used religion as per Machiavelli's advice. Chapter 3 is on 'Work and Play'. Shenkman doesn't note that as workers became wage-earners instead of self-employed in the 19th century, there was a new need for leisure time activities. Almost all entertainment or sports were invented in the Victorian era (p.35). Show business is the true opiate of the people. The work ethic was replaced by the consumer ethic in the 1920s (p.45). Could scrimping and saving ruin the American economy (p.46)?<br />Chapter 4 is on 'Business'. Business has a long history of getting help from the government: special franchises, bounties, grants, immunities, protective tariffs, and land grants. Originally, corporations could not be created unless it performed a public service: canals, railroads, water supplies (p.53). Page 58 gives an example of censored history which made this book necessary. Shenkman identifies Marriner Eccles as the prophet of deficit spending (p.61). Page 63 notes how military spending supports business. The statistic about cotton production &quot;not until fifteen years after&quot; is misleading; 1860 produced a huge crop. The statistic about railroad trackage is also suspect (p.65). &quot;War is the continuation of [business rivalry] through non-diplomatic means&quot; said Clausewitz. The post war period of &quot;laissez faire&quot; resulted in more economic depressions than any time in history. The output of commodities increased at a slower rate than before the Civil War (p.69)!<br />The book concludes with Chapter 12 'So Many Myths'. Page 193 tells of praise for Mayes' book; does this result from advertising and pay-offs to sell books? Could it explain the other myths and legends? As long as they can be sold, stories will be created. Look at TV. Just as America devised its own spelling (&quot;jail&quot; for &quot;gaol&quot;), so too they created new national myths (p.197). Are we that different from other peoples? Myths serve as symbols of cultural unity since the days of Remus and Romulus.	2003-06-02

Rather than suffer a slow recovery from weakened eyesight, he shipped out as a common sailor, rather than as a passenger, on a long sea voyage. After becoming a lawyer, he published his recollection of his voyage in 1840; it was an immediate success. He became an active member of the Free Soil Party, and represented fugitive slaves. This first and greatest book shows his sympathy for the suffering and the oppressed, and his courage, unselfishness, and fair-mindedness that characterized his life. This important book describes California before statehood and the gold rush, and life in those times. RHD hoped this book would promote religion and moral improvement for seamen, and diminish their hardships.   Chapter IV tells of being chased by a black hulled ship that flew no colors. They were able to outrun this ship, then lost it in the dark. Chapter V tells of the bad weather while rounding Cape Horn. They passed a whaler from Poughkeepsie NY. Chapter XIII gives his impressions of the Californians. RHD knew that local officials were appointed from the capital, but didn't ask if they controlled the local economy as a colony: produce raw material, buy finished goods. Chapter XVII tells how their captain, known for his flogging, could not hire any new seamen. Chapter XVIII tells of Easter celebration in California. The crews of Catholic vessels get about three more weeks of vacation in a year, and &#34;Yankees don't keep Christmas&#34;. Chapter XXI tells more about California politics. Since the independence of Mexico the missions and their lands became the prey of administradores, and became diminished and decayed. RHD describes the lack of common law, and the private morality. It was a rich country waiting to be exploited.   Chapter XXIII tells of the advantages of a bigger ship over a smaller ship: more hands make lighter work. But a smaller lighter ship can catch a slight breeze that becalmsa bigger ship. Chapter XXV tells how the heavy import taxes of Mexico are handled. A vessel puts in to declare a moderate cargo, then sells a large part. It then sails to another port; but on the way it gets other goods to replenish its cargo. RHD describes his visit to a whaleship, whose crew resembled fishermen and farmers. [Whalers got a share of the profits, not a wage.] The chapter ends with a description of a 3-day gale. Chapter XXIX tells of preparations to sail home: ballast is dumped, the ship sealed and fumigated to kill vermin. Then the hides are loaded, then steeved to pack in more. This hard work was fueled by a constant diet of fresh beef. Chapter XXX tells of the return trip by a shorthanded and inexperienced crew; they would round Cape Horn in the dead of winter, the worst possible time. Chapter XXXI tells of the sailor's need for rum or hot coffee in wintertime; and what it is like to have a tooth-ache at sea. Chapter XXXII describes the terrible times in the iceberg fields. Chapter XXXV tells of the haste to get home by keeping sails aloft. Scurvy had broken out on the ship due to no fresh provisions. They met a brig and got potatoes and onions for a cure.   The Concluding Chapter tells that drudgery and hardship is a sailor's life, not romantic fantasies. The captain must control everything, and be responsible for everything (mistreatment of seamen). Passengers on board (independent witnesses) result in better treatment of seamen. The lives of merchant seamen are shortened by a lack of sleep. RHD would not abolish flogging: most seamen are foreigners, the cast-offs of war vessels, and unknown to the captains. Force is needed to control them. Gradual improvement will correct this, he claims. RHD strongly objects to the practice of granting leniency to a convicted captain or officer because of previous good character, or a family to support. First, they don't know what it was like there, and this excuse is never granted to seamen! It is just a reward for class differences. Moral improvement is the seamen's best friend. RHD visited California 24 years later and writes about this in the last chapter.	2003-06-02

Spence examines the current system of justice in America, and the crimes of corporations. Workers have basically no rights in their workplace.     Chapter 1 notes that corporations rule the American people. Justice is made for corporations, not the people (p.4). Justice can't be defined; you recognize it when its gone. Chapter 2 says that Washington DC has one lawyer for every 60 people. Lawyers are legal warriors who battle for the cause that hires them. Chapter 3 tells how Spence trains for a trial; the lawyer must feel for his client. Spence tells of the discrimination in selecting law school students. Pages 46-8 explain how the LSAT is rigged in favor of upper class students. Chapter 4 tells how law schools turn out graduates who have little experience, and practice on their clients (p.56); this was not an accident (p.61). Page 69 tells of the \\"worker's compensation\\" scandal which exploits and degrades wage laborers. Chapter 6 explains how Federal judges are appointed (p.93). Their attitudes are investigated and then the candidates. The candidate must make \\"hefty financial contributions\\"! Their decisions are payment to their political obligations. Electing judges is covered on pages 97-8.     Chapter 7 explains trials as a sport conducted by its rules, with an umpire who can choose the victor. Page 114 tells dealing with a contractor. An insurance company lawyer protects the greedy from the needy (p.118). Chapter 8 discusses the status of wage earners in our society. Corporate power rests on the ability to exploit workers for their owners. Chapter 9 portrays the insurance industry as a type of protection racket: pay or become poorer without it. Insurance companies profit from litigation (p.183); they are not subject to antitrust laws! \\"Tort Reform\\" does NOT lower insurance premiums (p.192). It will not eliminate negligence or malpractice by physicians. Pages 194-5 tell of propaganda by the insurance companies. There are no more lawsuits per capita than in 1959, and the amount of the mean verdict is the same, adjusting for inflation. \\"Tort Reform\\" punishes the victims; you can't preserve your rights by giving them away. Chapter 10 tells of corporate crime which is over ten times greater than the crimes of individuals (p.198). Government regulators are controlled by the industries they regulate (p.205).     Part Two of this books considers the cures for the problems. Chapter 11 discusses the pernicious effect of the ABA's LSAT requirements for law school. Spence suggests practical alternatives to produce a better product. Chapter 12 is about the lawyer factories. Law describes politics - the power relationships that exist in our society (p.237). Chapter 13 writes about judges. Many came from the ranks of prosecutors. Spence suggests drafting lawyers for judges the was a jury is drafted for a trial. Judges with lifetime tenure derive from Royal rule. Chapter 14 gives many examples of corporate crime that would not occur with this legal fiction. Corporate crime will not end until management is held responsible for their actions. Pages 277-9 tells of corporate murder convictions, and of poisoning their customers. Chapter 15 discusses the evil influence of television: it blots out the real world for a pleasurable and passive mental state. It is controlled by corporations to condition Americans to reject their rights! The networks manufacture audiences for sale to advertisers. TV avoids the mass murders from asbestos to concentrate on personal crime (p.309). Chapter 16 suggest we examine our myths of freedom. If we are better off than other peoples it could mean that corporate interests have not yet reduced us to third-world conditions! [The attempts of \\"gun control\\" is one way to do this.] We must not ration freedom in America (p.318). Read this book for an understanding of our current status.	2003-05-29

Soviet atom bomb development began in 1939, they deduced American research in 1940 (p.80). Julius Rosenberg became involved with Soviet espionage, and a recruiter of people who could provide \\"technical information\\". The crime is committed when the message is relayed (p.92). Life in Oak Ridge or Los Alamos is likened to a socialist paradise where the government provides for everyone; but not all enjoy Army life (pp.100-1). None suspected that DG's insatiable curiosity was to gather information for a foreign government (p.104). Winston Churchill's scientists asked for dynamite lenses (p.107).

The Soviet atomic research resumed in 1943 (p.182), their first atomic test occurred in 1949. This affected the political outlook in Washington (p.183). When they deciphered a message on gaseous diffusion in refining uranium, this led to its author and prime suspect - Klaus Fuchs (p.188). Another deciphered message said a spy at Los Alamos went on vacation in Jan 1945 (p.197); 100 suspects were turned up. The two prime suspects were Luis Alvarez and Edward Teller - the best friend of Klaus Fuchs. <br />DG's confession is on page 242. He hired O. John Rogge and cooperated with the FBI; he could not testify against his wife (p.261). Greenglass and Gold were interviewed together to harmonize their stories (p.278). The Government wanted Julius Rosenberg to confess and identify other members of the spy ring (p.282); the death penalty was the threat (p.287). David was trained as a draftsman and had surprising neat handwriting (p.297). Page 317 says his handwriting needed to be typed, and this implicated Ethel in the crime. The trial found them all guilty. The Rosenbergs got death, but they insisted on their innocence and never cracked. They were convicted on the word of the Greenglasses alone, there was no independent corroborative evidence given at their trial. I think the failure to show spending or money from their spying was a failure in the Government's case. The rule is that spies get paid for their information (\\"The Double-Cross System\\").<br />Some questioned the scientific value of Greenglass' atom bomb sketch. It was \\"valuable information\\" to corroborate the information given by Klaus Fuchs (p.408). The 1946 Smyth Report gave much more information on atomic energy research than given by Klaus Fuchs (p.410)! Page 425 lists the information that Julius could give to delay their execution; nothing was asked of Ethel. President Eisenhower denied clemency because they \\"increased the chance of atomic war and may have condemned tens of millions of innocent people to death\\" (p.430).<br />Chapter 36 has Greenglass' \\"final confession\\". He thought the worse thing he did was working on the atomic bomb because it killed a hundred thousand people (p.469). He didn't regret his spying if it prevented another war (p.479). David and Ruth now said they didn't remember Ethel typing the notes, but \\"that's the way it would have been done\\" (p.483). Without this, Ethel might not have been convicted. Why didn't Julius and Ethel save themselves? Because it would mean putting other people in their hot seat (p.493). DG's verdict: they were guilty, but they didn't deserve to die (p.496). This disproportionate punishment may explain Pope Pius XII's call for clemency. The Prosecution team never again won distinction in their careers.	2003-05-27

Nizer usually wrote about his own cases, but decided to research this case with no opinion as to their guilt or innocence. The reason that truth is stranger than fiction in the courtroom is that \\"fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; truth isn't\\" (p.3). A trial is a war fought under civilized rules. Many people have definite opinions about cases from newspaper accounts, but newspapers give only fragments, not the whole case. Judicial opinions are not the means to a conclusion, but a rationalization of a conclusion (p.5). It is possible to take the record of any trial and through post-facto reasoning deduce that the verdict was wrong. But a jury has the right to apply common sense and their observation of the witnesses; this is not recorded. A jury will forgive errors of law, but not of facts. [Do modern trial lawyers concentrate  on jury selection to effectively win a case?] Any critic of a case usually has not heard the witnesses testify. [This assumes that the evidence and witnesses were correctly perceived in this or any other trial. Would perjury and planted evidence change this view?]<br /><br />For Nizer the question should be \\"do you think there was sufficient evidence to decide they were guilty?\\" The answer is plainly \\"yes\\". But if they had been found not guilty, would the same question apply?<br /><br />Louis Nizer was a defender of the Warren Commission Report; would he have learned anything afterwards? Page 6 tells of the finding of a Mauser on the sixth floor of the Book Depository Building. Nizer makes the willful mistake of saying it was another rifle! He wasn't there, and didn't see the published picture, yet he claims to know the real truth! So you should know that Nizer has the fault of seeing what he wants to see.<br /><br />I used to believe that the Rosenbergs were spies and traitors; this book explains that they were never indicted for treason, and never convicted of espionage. I now believe that were scapegoats for a show trial to explain away the loss of America's atom bomb \\"secret\\". Russia, like other countries, were involved in atomic research in the 1930s. Some of the scientists at Los Alamos were sending secrets to foreign countries. \\"The House on 92nd Street\\" claimed that the atom bomb secret was kept safe by the FBI. There was no mention of Army counter-intelligence. This 490 page book lacks an index and table of contents.<br /><br />\\"Blueprints for Utopia never take into account human frailties. That is why they are so alluring in print and so ineffectual in practice\\" (p.23). This, and other interesting comments on this case and the law in general make this a good book to read.	2003-05-16

At first, most people believed in a \\"lone gunman\\", but too many facts and witnesses changed people's opinions. The revelations created the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1976-79) whose conclusion was more than one shooter, and a conspiracy. There were a number of books written afterwards. But when Jim Garrison began his investigation the US government and the major media came down hard on him (p.xv).     On 11/22/1963 Guy Banister pistol whipped his associate Jack Martin, who then told Assistant DA Herman Kohlman that David Ferrie had made a quick trip to Texas that Friday (p.7). DA Jim Garrison ordered Ferrie jailed for questioning by the FBI. His doubts about the case began after a talk with Senator Russell Long in 1966 (p.13). JG found the Warren Report to be \\"disorganized and confused\\" (p.15). Page 25 tells how Lee H Oswald acted as an agent provocateur in New Orleans for Guy Banister.     In 1966 JG started to re-investigate the case (Chapter 3). In Chapter 4, JG compares the real Oswald to the Warren Commission caricature. Oswald had the character for an intelligence recruit: a military family, close-mouthed by nature, above average in intelligence (p.47). All the facts of his life say Oswald worked for a government agency (p.55). Pages 101-3 tell of the original route for the Presidential motorcade, but not who had it changed. Pages 110-2 shows their detective work on a telephone call. Page 115 shows use of the \\"red book\\" (lists individuals by addresses). JG tells what he accomplished as DA of New Orleans (p.128).    Chapter 13 tells of \\"The Assault\\" on his investigation by the corporate media (p.161). Page 167 tells of the witness tampering by NBC. The criminals who testified for NBC later took the Fifth, and a contempt conviction, rather than repeat their stories under oath (p.170). JG's staff was infiltrated by the CIA (p.179). Extraditions and subpoenas were returned without action. Chapter 15 explains why Oswald did not kill Officer Tippit: he didn't match the description, there was a problem with the shells (pp.198-202). In telling about his appearance on the Johnny Carson show, JG wonders why the NY media industry was \\"so allergic to the very concept of conspiracy\\" (p.214).     Chapter 18 has his history of the trial of Clay Shaw. The autopsy testimony is on pages 246-249; were these errors deliberate, or due to incompetence? The jurors agreed that JFK was killed as the result of a conspiracy (p.251). The prosecution of Clay Shaw for perjury was stopped, in violation of Federal law (p.253). Then Jim Garrison won re-election as district attorney. Two years later the IRS arrested him on allegations of gambling pay-offs. One example of the desperate tricks used is on pages 259-260. Pages 265-270 tell how the case against JG was forged. But the trial derailed his re-election campaign, and he lost. Chapter 20 has a retrospection on the history of those times. JG believes the JFK assassination was to continue the Cold War and spending by the military-industrial complex (p.277). He discusses the various theories of who was behind the conspiracy. JG believes it came from within the CIA, with civilian help; just like Contragate (p.290). Page 293 suggests to me that Richard Condon's \\"Winter Kills\\" is a symbolic solution to why JFK was killed.     Why is Oswald \\"not guilty\\"? He was never convicted or even indicted! Why was he rubbed out two days later? To prevent him from proving his innocence! Lunch time is usually around noon. If Oswald went to lunch at noon and then washed down his meal with a bottle of soda from a machine when that policeman came by. Alive, he could have named the other people who were also in the lunchroom at that time (and they could have confirmed his alibi). Then the conspiracy would be obvious. Being in the second floor lunchroom solves the problem of hiding that rifle then running down four flights of stairs. Yes, this is my assumption, but it best explains the problem of Oswald's movements from the sixth to the second floor.    Another argument for Oswald's innocence is his denial of shooting the President. The killers of Presidents in the 19th century all boasted of their deed. So too those in the 20th century who attempted and failed. All used a pistol. Was Oswald lying about this? George O'Toole's book \\"The Assassination Tapes\\" explains why Oswald was telling the truth (or was crazy). The idea of a conspiracy also explains the differences in wounds seen in Parkland Hospital and those on the body in Bethesda. I think the conspirators simply sacrificed JFK's double to create a body whose wounds would fit the \\"lone gunman\\" theory. Why did the Establishment bump him off? JFK's use of drugs affected his judgment and risked a Nuclear War in October 1962. The book \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" explains JFK's health problems. Doesn't this theory best fit the known facts?	2003-05-13

So what does a private eye really to these days? This book tells of the actual cases from some detective agencies; they are as informative as they are interesting. A PI gathers information to sell to customers; most are former policemen. Most PIs work for lawyers. In criminal cases they find evidence the defense attorneys can use. Most cases are matrimonial: catching the erring spouse and documenting it for trial testimony. Page 12 tells what a \\"psychotherapist\\" means in NY. A \\"bounty hunter\\" captures fugitives as a representative of a bondsman. British Common Law and the Supreme Court case of Taylor vs Taintor establishes the right to arrest a fugitive anywhere, anytime, anyway. Its like rearresting an escaped prisoner (p.31).<br />A private museum gets set up as a tax dodge. Rich people donate heirlooms and get a hefty tax deduction. They still get to visit the family treasures. But the museum has to be careful in hiring employees (Chapter 6). Is being born to money a blessing? Read page 75. <br />Chapter 13 summarizes the 'data mining' techniques. Many people worry about their privacy, but often throw out all kinds of personal data in their trash (p.123). It is legal for the police, or anyone, to search people's garbage. The average American is recorded in about 39 government files, and 40 business files. Social Security numbers provide tracking numbers for all kinds of records. DMV records are used to find males who have not registered for the draft. The telephone company can provide a list of all local call (p.13). Want to get an unpublished telephone number? See page 131. <br />One of the most common bugs is the infinity transmitter. You dial the victim's telephone, then blow a tuned whistle into the receiver. You can now listen to anything (p.190). If the target uses the phone, he hears a dead or hissing line. Page 197 gives an example of counter-intelligence: talk designed to mislead the foe.<br />The booktells about four cases that are interwoven into 37 chapters. These cases would be easier to follow if kept contiguous. But this interweave may give a better idea of the multi-tasking that goes into detective work.<br />The story about the pushcart peddlers reminds me of something I once witnessed in Manhattan. While walking to the train station, I saw a pistachio peddler whose cart was jostled, knocking these nuts into the street. The vendor was carefully picking them up for resale.	2003-05-06

He wore jeans to pretend he was a demonstrator and infiltrate the crowd. He was then beaten with night sticks! Page 57 tells of the agent who protected LBJ in Dallas. Nixon subjected him to petty harassment until he resigned. In 1972 the Secret Service protected candidate Dr. Benjamin Spock, who was also listed as a \\"potential threat\\" (p.60). Information from an agent guarding Sen McGovern was passed to the White House (p.61). This hurt their morale. Chapter 7 gives his experience on guarding foreign dignitaries. Chapter 8 tells of guarding Presidential candidates. Its who you know, not what you know (p.118). Pages 131-2 tell of guarding the President in foreign countries.

Sherman considered himself the best strategist of the Civil War generals. His march to Atlanta succeeded with a single battle. He maneuvered his troops so the enemy withdrew. This very readable book tells about this later campaign. Burke Davis spent over ten years gathering eyewitness accounts fro obscure and forgotten sources. Fourteen pages in the Bibliography replace footnotes; this book is for reading as history.<br />Atlanta was a major supply station for the Confederacy; it was targeted like railroad marshaling yards in WW II. Destroying railroad yards, an oil refinery, and warehouses was a military objective, but the fires spread (as in 1871 Chicago). Sherman was blamed for the destruction of private property (p.6). Sherman's army would live off the land; they could take what was in the open, but could not enter homes (p.8). Most of Sherman's troops were from the West: Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, one regiment of white Alabama Unionists (p.11). Sherman reduced formality to a minimum, and gained these troops affection.<br />When war was declared Sherman volunteered. He turned down an appointment as brigadier general for a colonel of regular infantry (p.15). Sherman was put in command of the Western army, and began to develop his theory of total warfare with highly mobile forces (p.18). Sherman's capture of Atlanta helped Lincoln's re-election. His march to Savannah was planned using census reports of farm production for each county. Sherman had a flat hierarchy, officers reported to him directly (p.26).<br />This foraging, or pillaging and destruction, was unique in American history (p.43). The looting and destruction of the Milledgeville statehouse library reminded one officer of the looting of Egypt (p.64). Sherman had a low opinion of newspaper reporters: they had earlier said he was insane, and published military news that was used by the Confederacy (no censorship then). Sherman was forever blamed for burning Columbia (p.161), but he intended to only destroy public buildings (railroad depots, factories). He said the fire was started by cotton bales burned by retreating Confederate cavalry. Others said it was caused by drunken troops (p.179), and the failure of the Governor to destroy the liquor supplies. His campaign was marked by unexpected cruelties, last seen in 17th century European wars. But not in North Carolina (p.216). Colonel Rhett was a symbol of the arrogant Southern ruling class (p.228). Sherman's focus was on winning the war rather than a victory, so he avoided a battle if possible (p.239)<br />Sherman's \\"Memoirs\\" in 1875 assessed the roles of individuals and governments in a bluff and candid manner, without sentiment. Sherman had some Southern admiration because of his opposition to Negro voting rights, but lost this when he termed the Confederacy as an \\"idiotic, criminal conspiracy\\" (p.300). This made him more popular with the Northern public. His death in 1891 had this eulogy: \\"He never acknowledged an error and never repeated it\\" (p.302). Sherman said \\"War is Hell\\". Clausewitz correctly said \\"war is the continuation of business rivalry through non-diplomatic means\\". Destruction in a country eliminates competition for manufacturers, creates new business for merchants and new investments for bankers. War is paradise when you profit from it.	2003-04-29

Prior to the early 19th century strong drink was regarded as good if not medicinal. (Most houses had no central heating.) Women and children drank at home, men drank at work and in social gatherings (p.9). Industrial capitalism changed the economic fortunes of artisans and laborers, and there was an increase in drinking binges (p.10). The temperance movement started to grow from the 1830s on, as science discovered the bad effects of alcohol. So far it was just a personal choice, like styles in clothes. By the late 19th century effort began to control this choice by force of law. The newly powerful class of economic aristocrats decided to abolish alcoholic drinks. Since they would need to pass new laws, they decided on a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy. Little by little, laws were passed to limit choices. As soon as one restriction was passed, they went on to advocate new restrictions. You can see something similar today in the prohibition of smoking. Laws are passed every few years, or taxes are raised. The end results becoming clear. Another example is the activities of Gun Prohibitionists.<br />The Anti-Saloon League, created in 1895, spearheaded Prohibition. Rather than attack the drinker, they attacked the saloons where beer was sold. [Gun Prohibitionists attack gun stores and gun shows rather than gun owners.] The ASL asked their members to support the candidate, not the party. [Gun Prohibitionists operate in the shadows, and can influence officials better that way.] There were few women members in the ASL. [Gun Prohibitionists often feature women in leadership roles, even if the money men keep out of sight.] Control of the ASL remained in the hands of professional staffs. [Gun Prohibitionists use professional liars from advertising, public relations, and such.] The ASL ran on money donated by millionaires, and other donors. [Gun Prohibitionists are funded by front groups for millionaires, such as the Joyce Foundation or Open Society Institute. One millionaire created the Million Mom March, Inc; his withdrawal of funds ended it.]<br />Chapter 7 provides a seminar on influencing laws. Supporters were asked to write personal letters rather than sign petitions (p.1210. The ASL promised low taxes, peaceful politics, and a booming economy. [Gun Prohibitionists also make promises.] The ASL made use of democratic innovations such as initiative and referendum, and primary elections to advance their goals, yet tried to block their use against prohibitionists! The ASL wanted home rule where they could win, but banned it where they would lose (p.123)!<br />There are two things unmentioned (or unmentionable) in this book. First, the creation of public water supplies provided a safe alternative to beer (the historic remedy against polluted water). Second, the prohibition of alcohol provided a steady support to newly created organized crime (which still depends on local funding). Industrial capitalism needed criminal gangs to do its work in subjugating and exploiting wage earners. Were they needed to to the job that lawyers couldn't do?	2003-04-15

The Civil War spies were amateurs from other varied backgrounds, just like the soldiers. Chapter 1 tells the story about President-elect Lincoln's secret journey to Washington. Chapter 2 tells of William A. Lloyd, a businessman who traveled to the South with his wife and maid. His information was passed to his courier Thomas H. S. Boyd for delivery to Washington. Boyd often used released prisoners to carry back his information. Chapter 3 tells of Rose Greenhow's spying in Washington, where she was the intimate friend  of the Senator from Massachusetts. Her reports were corroborated by the news in Northern newspapers. Page 66 tells of the prewar partnership between William P. Wood and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton! The activities of Belle Boyd sound like a work of fiction if they weren't known as fact (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 tells of Confederate spies. Pinkerton's men were told to look at a man's shoes. Northerners wore the new style of different shoes for left and right feet, southerners wore the old style with the same shoe for either foot. The Confederates' early successes were due in part to better intelligence (p.92). Thomas N. Conrad led a colorful life as a Confederate spy. His haircut and mustache configuration (p.95) suggests he acted as a false double, and was involved in the Booth plot.<br />Chapter 6 tells of other Union spies, such as the talented Timothy Webster, Pinkerton agent (pp.125-130). Were his real exploits greater than the fictional James Bond? But Webster's luck changed after he was laid up with rheumatism. Chapter 8 tells of Benjamin F. Stringfellow, another colorful Confederate spy who had an interesting career. Chapter 9 tells of the Secret Services. By early 1863 the Union's intelligence was now better than the Confederates'. Gettysburg was a Union victory, not a draw. Chapter 10 tells of Lafayette C. Baker and his work in counter-intelligence. Chapter 11 tells of counter-intelligence in Europe, and the Trent Affair. Page 208 explains diplomatic appointments then; would today's news media report this?<br />Chapter 12 tells of the \\"Northwest Conspiracy\\". The bankers and merchants of New York City were the economic partners of the Southern cotton planters; profit was more important than the principle of Union (p.211). There were uprisings against the Conscription Act, the worst was the Draft Riots in July 1863. Opponents of the war wore the head of Liberty from a penny; hence the name \\"Copperheads\\". Chapter 13 tells of the attempts to raise an insurrection from Copperheads and Confederate agents and prisoners; it failed (pp.235-7). The raid on St. Albans VT was a success. Pages 247-250 tells of the attempt to burn Manhattan. Chapter 14 tells of the attempt to raid Richmond and free the Union prisoners. Colonel Dahlgren was killed, and his orders to kill Jeff Davis and his Cabinet were published. The US Government denied this as a fabrication or forgery. This angered many Southerners, and may have inspired John Wilkes Booth's fatal attack. Lincoln believed he would not be assassinated because the assassin would in turn die. No government would order such a thing, and only a madman would do it (p.273). The rest of this chapter discusses the conspiracy, and the capture of JW Booth. <br />The last 9 pages of Sources list many books as reference.	2003-04-15

Masterton has a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry and retired as a full Professor from the University of Connecticut in 1987. He had a long standing interest in this case, and began research after he retired (p.8). Chapters 1 to 8 give his short history of this crime, chapters 9 to 16 give his \\"solution\\". Many books have been written on the Borden Murders; the Sources on page 7 do not list those by E. Pearson and F. Spiering. Only two people were alive in that house after 11am. Lizzie was the likeliest suspect, but she couldn't have done it, and the jury agreed.    \\"Early accounts of the crime were loaded with factual errors\\" (p.18). This is a warning against using unverified newspaper records (p.8). Did Andrew Borden prosper handsomely (p.24)? The truth is that Andrew induced grieving customers to sign up for loans, then called these loans to foreclose on the homes. Andrew got rich by swindling widows and orphans! He became richer by buying into banks and factories, and real estate in growing Fall River. If one of his tenants received a higher salary, Andrew raised his rent. Andrew sold products from his home (p.25); he bought spoiled apple cider and sold it as vinegar. Page 34 quotes Bridget on the murders: \\"I'd be afraid to say anything at all. If I did, that terrible man that killed poor Mrs Borden might come back and kill me too.\\" What did she know and when did she know it?    Page 94 asks why Lizzie didn't burn that dress before the police searched the house. That would have left a residue in the stove. Page 107 talks about the three doors, but says nothing about cellar windows being used to get into the house. Page 124 says the assassin could go upstairs to the guest room to hide, but be discovered by Abby. The jury found Lizzie not guilty. The same lack of evidence also applies to Bridget, and Lizzie said \\"it wasn't Bridget ....\\" Robert Pinkerton says \\"an innocent person is more likely to make conflicting statements than is a guilty on.\\" (His firm was hired by Lizzie.)    Chapter 21 discusses the missing note. Could this explain why Abby went to the second floor guest room? AR Brown has a better explanation for this note. Her discovery of \\"Nemesis\\" led to her unplanned murder. Then this rage must have been directed to Andrew after he turned over that white box. The opinion of Dr Abbot (pp.200-1) seems to be political, not medical. JV Morse's answer (p.202) seems like a way to answer without saying anything. Chapter 14 questions the time of death for Abby. The fact is that Abby was last seen alive about 9:15am, her body was discovered around noon. Since she had been killed earlier than Andrew, the 90 minute estimate is dead accurate. The charts on page 205 are meaningless without indexes for time and temperature. The unscientific studies on page 206 are contradicted by Dr. Dolan's tests on the bodies. The trial testimony quoted on page 210 really means that if a stomach empties between \\"two or three hours\\" there is no estimate possible after this time. Nicole's empty stomach would put her death 3 hours after her 8pm supper. Ron's stomach should show eating between 10:30pm and 11pm (my estimate).    Chapter 16 has one of his solutions: an embezzling bank clerk who played the stock market But a white collar crime like this rules out a double murder? Was it JW Carpenter, who embezzled from Andrew's funeral business? Or maybe J Clegg? Masterton didn't solve the crime! Arnold R Brown's book provided the final solution in theory, because no one has come up with a better one. Masterton's fable violates the known facts of the case.	2003-04-14

McGehee spent 25 years in the CIA; he joined as an idealist, and left as a cynic. The crisis happened in Dec 1968. RWM wondered why we had to bomb the people we were trying to save? Why did the CIA report lies instead of the truth? He thought of his earlier work in Thailand, where his reports were first accepted, then denied in spite of his accuracy. The Agency preferred the old methods that resulted in more killings. RWM decided then to tell what he found out and warn the American people. The CIA is the covert action arm of the Presidency. It is not an intelligence agency because it only seeks the information that supports existing policies. Its propaganda uses disinformation to fool the US public, and justify policies by distorting reality.<br /><br />RWM was class president and in the honor society, and All State as a football tackler. An ardent Baptist, he went to Notre Dame and played on an undefeated football team that won national championships; he graduated cum laude. A telegram recruited him to fight communism and save our way of life. RWM went to Washington and passed the tests. The chapters in the book tell about his career in the agency. Chapter 5 tells of his \\"Life at Langley\\" when he returned to Headquarters. His knowledge of the Bay of Pigs came from television news. It seemed they relied too much on an assumed uprising of the Cuban people. Could such a mistake ever happen again? Pages 57-8 tells how the CIA promoted a bloody extermination campaign in Indonesia. (Read L Fletcher Prouty's book on this.) Page 59 tells of agency coups in South America. American training of the military and police created traitors who overthrew their governments; was this the definition of subversion?<br /><br />Page 61 quotes Howard Hunt on gathering \\"any and all information\\" on Presidential candidate Goldwater for delivery to the White House. Page 63 tells of the CIA's insertion of individuals into dissident circles in order to establish their credential for foreign operations. (Could this explain W J Clinton's success?) Page 64 tells how RWM was transferred to Thailand, and page 80 tells of the sad results. Pages 111-6 tells of his successful survey of Thailand. This \\"good news\\" resulted in his quick removal! Years later the truth dawned on him: the CIA didn't want the truth! This tells of the management trick of offering a transfer to a better job, then eliminating the job after the employee transfers. RWM became another paper pusher. Page 120 shows the bureaucratic faults of the CIA. Page 128 tells of the fatal flaws of our presence in Vietnam. Pages 129-135 gives Vietnamese history in a nutshell. Page 146 summarizes the problem: how was it that one junior officer was better informed and had a clearer picture of the reality out there than all the rest of the Agency? Is this unique to a government agency? The bottom of page 159 tells of the results of his experiences. Chapter 14 concludes and summarizes this book.<br /><br />The Appendix is the last part, but you should read it first to understand the writing of this book. His secrecy agreement let the CIA review and censor any information that they did not want revealed. When his writing was censored, he was allowed to substitute information from open sources. (See page 35 in Chapter 3 on the use of agents.) When RWM found a published book with the same opinions he was then allowed his critical comments. The CIA's secrecy agreement stops critics from explaining their actions to the American people.	2003-04-14

DR replied \\"No sir, Mr President, are you?\\" (a classic response to an accusatory question). Nixon had a habit of diverting or asking for a repeat to give himself more time (p.10). But this interchange gave DR a reputation, and recognition.<br />Chapter 1 is about his beginnings, and learning journalism at Sam Houston State Teacher's College at Huntsville TX. DR grew up in the Houston area, the oldest in the family. His father read a lot of newspapers. His college professor didn't \\"teach\\", he gave them assignments and kept them writing stories. Learning by doing certainly worked for DR. The rest of this chapter has interesting stories about his college life. Chapter 2 has DR at a CBS affiliate TV station in 1961. The most important ingredient was live local coverage; this attracts and holds viewers. DR was sent to cover Hurricane Carla on the gulf, the biggest and most dangerous of the century, which caused high tides and flooding rains. The warnings and the evacuation of 350,000 people, minimized the loss of lives.  Afterwards DR was hired by CBS News, even if he didn't rescue a drowning horse (pp.47-8). Chapter 3 tells of his reporting from Oxford Miss on 9/30/1962 when James Meredith went to the University, and other places. Chapter 4 tells of his reporting on the civil rights issue. DR doubts the authenticity of the secret tapes on Dr ML King (p.101).<br />Chapter 5 tells of his assignment in Dallas on 11/22/1963. He was stationed beyond the triple underpass to pick up film; something happened and cars sped by. DR returned to the station to cover the news. This shows reporting behind th scenes (pp.124-8). After a confidential viewing of the Zapruder film, DR went back to the station and told of its contents (p.133). Checkbook Journalism? In England paying for news was a way of life (p.141). Magazines were doing it for years. Chapter 6 continues the reports from Dallas, and the behind the scenes events in news reporting. The conflict at the local TV station was resolved. DR then tells about his years as a foreign correspondent in London and elsewhere. Chapter 10 summarizes his year in Vietnam, 1965-6. \\"By the time the information is passed up the chain of command, everyone puts the best possible face on it.\\" Chapter 11 starts with his meeting with HR Haldeman: DR was a \\"Lyndon Johnson, Texas liberal Democrat\\". No need for facts since they knew everything! His meeting with Erlichman and Haldeman (pp.248-9) does not honor this pair. Does it reflect unfavorably on Nixon's judgment? Page 250 tells of the effect of Chappaquiddick: Nixon moved further to the right. Was it an accident? After their loss in the 1970 elections Nixon used other Dirty Tricks to try to hang on to power.<br />Chapter 12 is about Watergate, \\"the greatest political story of your time\\". The Washington PD is closely controlled by the White House, as in a one-industry town. Page 264 tells of the coded questioning used with government sources: they won't lie, but they won't tell you anything unless you already know it. The story of President Nixon shoving Ron Ziegler, then denying it after the film was shown makes me wonder if Nixon was psychotic? That would explain some of his actions, and why he was pardoned (p.273). Chapter 13 says television news is a \\"headline service\\"; anyone who depends on it entirely for news is not doing their best. \\"Many Americans really do not want to be told what their government is doing, any more than they would want to know what went into the grinder to make the hot dog they are eating\\" (p.336). A rather sad commentary on some Americans! Do they deserve their higher taxes and perhaps illnesses? Page 338 tells why print is superior to broadcast in preserving the news.	2003-03-29

AC led a parallel life: public school, Harvard, many of the same courses from the same professors, graduate student and assistant professor, received a PhD, and moved to the Montana wilderness. AC found that the most transforming decade was the 1950s; the 1960s were \\"merely acting out a drama whose script had already been written\\" (p.12). The \\"Unabomber Manifesto\\" contained many of the ideas found in the lectures and readings found at Harvard and other liberal arts colleges (pp.20-21).<br />Virtually everything that most people believe about TK is false! His ideas date from the 1950s, not the 1960s. His decision to retreat to the wilderness was made at Harvard, not Berkeley. TK is not a revolutionary hero, nor original philosopher, not genuine environmentalist. His manifesto is neither brilliant nor a sign of mental illness, but a set of cliches whose sentiments are shared by millions (p.24). TK was not the first Harvard murderer (p.26), but had the highest body count - he used technology!<br />Harvard was the site of the Murray psychological experiments on undergraduates which were so unsavory and unethical as to be kept secret to this day (p.31). This book is about the dysfunctional high school environment that is still with us. It tells about the exploitation of colleges during the Cold War by the government. These forces created a culture of despair that infects the educational system and promotes patterns of violence. The purpose of this book is to understand TK as an intellectual and as a criminal.<br />Pages 85-94 analyze the \\"Unabomber Manifesto\\". It contains the conventional wisdom of the entire country. Its publication led to his capture since its thinking identified the author to his family. Pages 123-4 tell of the newspaper reports of his arrest. TK's habits were not dissimilar to others in his area. It tells about TK's friends in the area (pp.125-6). Page 131 shows small groups of journalists discussing how the news should be played, then filing identical stories on the trial. TK faced the death penalty, but he refused the defense of \\"diminished mental state\\" (pp.134-40). The evaluation by experts had conclusions that supported their side (p.141). Was the decision by the judge (p.147) part of a cover-up?<br />Chapter 11 to 13 covers General Education and the \\"Culture of Despair\\" that follows \\"logical positivism\\". Was its effect to brainwash and break down the values of the \\"best and the brightest\\" to create subservient automatons for corporate America? Could this explain the appeal of fundamentalist sects? This is the most important part of this book! Gen Ed undermined values rather than reinforced them (p.205).<br />Chapter 15 tells of Murray's Experiment, which violated the Nuremburg Code (p.236). Many questionnaires were used to learn the background of the subject before 'The Experiment'. Does it remind you of that interrogation in \\"The Darkness at Noon\\"? Chapter 16 tells about Henry Murray, a psychologist who couldn't cure himself. The book ends by noting that schools are even less dedicated to learning than they were, substituting political and behavioral correctness, and using drugs to do this (p.364). Are uneducated people easier to control? Is this the reason for this education?	2003-03-18

This is JLS' humorous history in a very serious agency. The television series \\"The FBI\\" was phony; the only inspectors he knew were those who investigated FBI employees (p.8), Could the show have ended after J Edgar Hoover's death because Hoover could no longer pull strings?     After graduating with an MA in English, WW II veteran JLS applied for a job as clerk in Washington; jobs were scarce in Texas. He was accepted, and showed up late. (He had learned one thing in the Army: never admit a mistake or oversight.) His story of getting on the wrong bus worked! JLS attended college in the morning, then worked 1 to 10pm. Chapter 2 tells how he got promoted - by applying for another job! Most employees would report any word or deed that suggested disloyalty to the Director. (There are other places like this.)  Page 42 tells of a farewell party for a SAC which ended his career. Was he set up by a rival?     Chapter 5 warns you to be careful in your compliments! Chapter 6 tells of the importance of being ignorant. Was there a scandal in your office? \\"I've been too busy doing my work to pay attention to office gossip.\\" Chapter 7 tells of the Metropolitan Life Insurance weight tables and how they were applied to agents. One solution was to extend height or enlarge frames - on paper. One agent knew the difference between perception and reality. Were these tables ever scientifically validated? There were two items in the news recently: obesity is at an all time high, and so is life expectancy! Isn't science wonderful?     Chapter 13 tells of a visit by J Edgar Hoover to Senator Lyndon B Johnson in Texas. There was quite a lot of behind the scenes activity. This would not occur in other government agencies because of civil service regulations. Maybe high-level officers in some corporations could tell similar stories? I wonder if this will be repeated at Homeland Security in the future? Chapter 14 tells how the Bureau catered to every whim of the Director, from toilets to television sets. Does absolute power corrupt absolutely? After I read about J Edgar Hoover in the 1950s \\"Readers Digest\\", I was disappointed to discover the reality afterwards. Chapter 15 tells of the personal concerns of Hoover. Anyone who wanted a promotion had to see him for his personal approval. There were no guarantees; some whim could result in condemnation to the Field. When Clarence Kelley took over, one of his first actions was to send Administrators into the Field, and replace them with men from the Field. This gave knowledge and experience to all; the Administrators could live by their rules.     I guess any Police Chief must rule with an iron hand. Could it help if this ruler has a trusted, loyal friend or relative who could serve as a counselor to filter opinions for feedback? The one substantive fault in the lack of any mention of the events of November 1963.	2003-03-17

In the late 18th century the local tavern was a meeting place for resistance and revolution, and became a symbol of freedom and egalitarianism. Whiskey and brandy were considered healthful or medicinal from Puritan times (p.7). In the early 19th century treating voters to drinks suggested sociability, equality, and the principle that the purpose of government was to help citizens. Others would say it was an attempt to corrupt or manipulate voters. Increased alcohol consumption was often followed by family violence and public disorder. Consumption between 1800 and 1830 was more than double from today. This led to treating alcohol as a social problem to be solved by temperance: drinking beer, cider, or wine, not distilled liquors. Men drank at work or in taverns, women and children at home. The spirit of progress and improvement, along with temperance, began in the 1830s. The religious revival emphasized the perfectibility of mankind, and the need to abolish wickedness. Temperance became the standard for middle class behavior (p.31). Alcohol consumption dropped to its lowest in the century in 1845. Efforts began to prohibit the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages (Maine 1851), but these were repealed or ignored by 1860.<br />The factory system resulted in a permanent class of wage laborers who could never own their own shop, and this frustration was followed by more drinking (p.10). Increased alcohol use was followed by tavern and street riots (p.12). Science found that alcohol was not good, whether in whiskey or beer. This refuted the long-held beliefs from olden times, and was used to support attempts to restrict or ban alcohol.<br />The economic problems of the 1870s and later marked the formation of the WCTU and the Prohibition Party. But some believed that poverty and hopelessness bred alcohol dependency, not the reverse (p.71). (Could this explain obesity today?) Most saloons were tied to breweries to provide outlets for what was now a big business (p.94). (Like gasoline stations today?) Many offered a free lunch with a nickel beer, often better or cheaper than in restaurants (p.104). <br />Prohibition in America came about from the Anti-Saloon League founded in 1895. It was the first modern professional lobby composed of salaried employees supported by donations from the public, and millionaires (pp.113-4). Chapter 6 explains how this was done. Chapter 7 describes the background lobbying used to bring about prohibition as needed for the war effort. Prohibition would result in order, efficiency, and alertness (p.149); it would win the war and create prosperity too. Here's how the trick was done: the 18th Amendment banned the sale and manufacture of \\"intoxicating beverages\\"; many thought this only applied to whiskey and brandy. Afterwards the Volstead Act was passed to set the standard at 0.5% alcohol, which now applied to beer and wine as well! Instead of peace and prosperity, the 1920s had crime, violence, and then the Depression. Chapter 8 tells of the problems of prohibition, and how it was repealed almost as quickly as it was enacted. Some say it was a \\"noble experiment\\", as if ordinary Americans were laboratory rats to be tested by social engineers. This book is important as a short history. Are the same lobbying tricks being repeated today?	2003-03-12

I think it is hypocrisy to apply it to Edmund G Ross (supported a President against Congress), or Gerald R Ford (covered up a President who was virtually impeached). Both can be said to have obstructed justice and the lawful popular will. So why was James Florio added to this list? Neither Florio nor Ford have suffered from their actions; losing an election isn't a sacrifice, it’s part of political life.  When Florio ran for Governor in 1989 he promised not to raise the sales and income taxes. He not only reneged, he extended the sales tax to items previously exempt! The authors take a perverse pride in these actions, but cannot (or dare not) explain why. It is regressive and reactionary to have a sales tax so much higher than the income tax.  Florio was a Congressman from Camden NJ, a once important industrial city that is now a stripped junker of a city. Page 72 shows another dishonest statement about NJ. The Colony of NJ was controlled by the large landowners, then the railroads and other powerful corporations. What Governor has NOT been a servant of the Corporations since the Civil War?  A. Quindlen uses an anecdote (p.72) to justify Florio's law, but never mentions the special interest forces and the money used to pay for this law. She does admit the most objectionable feature was the confiscation of legally owned guns. The Federal Constitution forbids ex post facto laws! The rejection by the courts underlines the lack of democracy in NJ. Judges were never popularly elected since NJ was a Colony. The loss of the Senate and Assembly in 1991 seemed mainly due to the sales and income tax increases. This was the correct political response.  A. Quindlen does an incompetent job in writing of the history of gun prohibition (p.76-77). Those &#34;opinion polls&#34; merely reflect the wishes of those who paid for the desired results. The referendums held in Massachusetts and California overwhelmingly rejected gun prohibition. Since 1987 thirty-three states passed &#34;right to carry&#34; laws. Page 78 lists the latest tactic of gun prohibitionists: present it as a police safety measure. They use politically appointed police chiefs; some do it for the money. On page 80 Quindlen finally tells of the Florio taxes His &#34;skill at taking his case to the people&#34; (p.81) failed miserably once Florio had to talk about a subject most people were familiar with. his defeat by a rich dilettante shows the efficiency of political machines in running a scandal-free candidate (just like Woodrow Wilson). The loss of &#34;grass roots&#34; by &#34;Hands Across NJ&#34; shows what happens to a politically naive movement that lacks a competent cadre of leaders.  Florio's &#34;sour grapes&#34; comments on &#34;the influence of money in the process&#34; recalls similar whines from Bill Bradley, whose Senate law started to tax Social Security. The failure of Whitman to act on campaign promises is not new (p.86); she was the latest puppet of the Republican machine.	2003-03-11

This book contains two dozen opposing viewpoints on the subject of &#34;gun control&#34;. Chapter 4 asks &#34;what measures would reduce gun violence?&#34; and provides eight answers. Reading opposing views will educate you, but you should browse some of the books in your library for more depth.   Viewpoint 1 claims &#34;gun control&#34; will reduce lethal crime. The writer says criminal assaults and robberies are not higher in the United States than other developed countries, but the murder rate is much higher. (Actually, the rate of violent deaths in America is lower than in many European countries, and Japan.) Louisiana's murder rate is 20 times the rate of Vermont (which has little gun control). Cities have more murders than rural areas (with guns?). Page 130 mentions that none of the theories can explain this! But the writer claims that eliminating handguns would lower the number of homicides! Viewpoint 2 says gun control will not reduce violent crime; it is a failure in other countries. Japan's abolition of private gun ownership resulted in an increase of gun violence (p.132). This also happened in Australia and Great Britain (p.133). But in America violent crime continues to fall as the number of states with &#34;shall issue&#34; laws increase.   Viewpoint 3 claims gun control will reduce school violence, because guns were used in the 1999 Columbine massacre. Yet prior to the 1968 Gun Control Act, most schools had rifle teams, guns were more handy, and no massacre ever happened! There were no monstrous high schools, MTV, video games, working mothers, and, less oppression of students. Viewpoint 4 says gun control will not reduce school violence, because firearms are obtained illegally. In spite of the corporate media attention, school violence is declining, and students are still safest in school (p.141). The Columbine killers illegally obtained their legally bought guns. Proposals made after this crime were flawed. Most gun violence is intentional, not accidental. Besides, the 1968 Gun Control Act was supposed to cure this! There are flaws in the criminal justice system (p.145). More people are deterred from crime by social standards, not laws (p.146). He suggests prevention programs need more funding (p.147). But there's big money in prison constructions and operation, and payoff to politicians that suggest early intervention programs will be skimped.   Viewpoint 5 claims gun manufacturers should be held responsible for gun violence. But manufacturers of automobiles, baseball bats, knives, etc. are NOT responsible for their misuse! The CPHV tries to use the tort system to prosecute gun manufacturers for misuse of their products. Isn't this barratry? The truth is that CPHV is using civil torts in an attempt to get guns outlawed since they can't accomplish this through legislation. This article has many half-truths and one-sided claims. It could be used as an example of sophisticated special pleading (p.149-153). Viewpoint 6 says gun manufacturers should not be held responsible for gun violence since it allows courts to make laws that should be enacted by legislatures. Product liability law says manufacturers are not responsible for criminal or negligent misuse of non-defective products (p.157). Viewpoint 7 claims gun safety standards should be mandatory, and suggests some solutions. He also tells of the problem with each. None will prevent human error. Viewpoint 8 says gun safety standards should not mandatory. There are risks in gun ownership as there are with flying or traveling in general. While 392 children were killed in gun accidents, 590 died from medicine poisoning (childproof caps?), 1063 from burns, 1247 from drownings, and 5503 from cars (p.175). And 200 from falls.	2003-03-08
1205727:US	38002140	R27X449DLKVP6Q	0446520810	825118320	The Search for Justice: A Defense Attorney's Brief on the O.J. Simpson Case	Books	4	6	17	N	N	His Search for Truth	The Search for Justice  The Prologue tells about the Bill of Rights, and the duty of a defense lawyer to represent his client. Robert L. Shapiro politely tries to educate the willfully ignorant about law and reality. The corporate media should be blamed for its misinformation. The death of a spouse focuses suspicion on a surviving spouse, especially if they were alone and have no alibi. An accusation is enough to destroy a life. This very readable book lacks an index and table of contents; it is not a good reference. It has 24 chapters in its 363 pages. The last chapter lists the two errors that lost the prosecution’s case. The chapters grow shorter near the end as it they were edited to fit a limit.  Chapter One tells why RLS has to know if his client committed the crime, else the prosecutor has an advantage. He asked OJ Simpson if he did it: “I did not do this” (p.10). Once the justice system locks in, innocence has nothing to do with the outcome of a case! Against OJ were 45 deputy district attorneys, the resources of the LAPD, and the assistance of the Chicago PD, the FBI, and Interpol. There was never any consideration of a plea bargain by anyone (p.13). Chapter Two tells of his recruitment of the experts. If a detective’s job becomes “getting the guy”, then that is improper and foolish. In a rush to judgment evidence is overlooked or mishandled, and procedural and investigative mistakes are made. They would let OJ take a lie detector test if the results would be admitted to court; Marcia Clark refused this (pp.26 7). This test creates charts that can be interpreted in different ways, and challenged on the basis of wrong questions framed the wrong way!  The murderer had to have some bodily injury from this violent struggle. RLS had OJ’s physical condition recorded immediately (no cuts or bruises on head, torso, arms or legs). There was an unprecedented swarm of reporters on this case (p.35). Why was it played up so much by the corporate media? [Todistract people from the bad news of May 1994.] Pages 60 62 explain why the grand jury was dismissed and a preliminary hearing was obtained. Pages 70 72 tell of the problems where four detectives left the Bundy crime scene to travel to Rockingham. The more important the evidence is to the prosecution, the lower the constitutional standard (p.86)! I think a witness was dropped because of a credibility problem (p.87). The judge is part of the prosecution team, usually a former prosecutor (p.109). The forensic criteria puts the deaths after 11PM (p.91). Mark Fuhrman was the key detective in the all important first hours, but his name never appeared in the reports (p.93). Crime laboratories are exempt from regulation and review (p.149), that’s why the defense wanted the evidence checked by their experts. The polling as to OJ’s guilt was not based on what you knew, but on who your parents were (p.192)! Sequestering the jury prevented contamination by stories in the media (p.203). Pages 218 9 summarizes RLS’ dispute with F Lee Bailey.  Bailey’s cross-examination of Fuhrman led to a perjury conviction (Chapter 15). The gloves didn’t fit because they didn’t belong to OJ (p.295). Hair examinations have never been recognized as a positive means of identification (p.302). EDTA is used to preserve blood samples (p.313). If EDTA is found in blood evidence, then it was planted as real evidence on those socks and the back gate. In August 1995 the McKinney tapes were turned over to the defense, who tried to get them into court. Page 318 suggests to me that the substitute for the coroner committed prosecutorial perjury: submitting opinions for fact. Page 319 tells how Marcia Clark tried to protect a prosecutorial witness from his perjury, then tried to replace the judge! RLS was “stunned” by the speed of the verdict, but isn’t that usual when they don’t believe the prosecution’s case? RLS tells of the errors in the prosecution’s case, and why the “mountainof evidence” collapsed (p.352 4). Could the anti-defense attitude in the press corps be explained by the policy of the National Association of Editors & Publishers or the corporate media owners (p.357)? That’s a bigger problem than in just one criminal case.	2003-03-05

It has no index or table of contents for its 320 pages. It is a continuation of \\"The Making of a Cop\\", the career of David Carbone. Most murders rarely make the new because there's nothing sensational about them (p.12)!<br />The mega-metropolis of NY has 301 square miles with neighborhoods of every size and economic condition. Communities of every race, color, religion, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, and political belief. About 2000 murders occur in NY each year, one-tenth of all US homicides! NY detectives solve these and other violent crimes. The Robbery Identification Program was created after they found robbers tended to operate in the same area (p.38). Separate units would concentrate just on robberies in select areas. Robberies often occur with shootings, stabbings, or beatings. Robbers were creatures of habit and do their crimes in the same way. <br />Pages 95-6 tell how one shooting is solved. It happened at a dirt lot. The experienced detective noticed muddy sneakers on an associate of the victim. Brought in for questioning, and the case was solved. Sounds easy, doesn't it? Like watching a major league batter hit one into the stands. Real life detectives needn't be terribly adept in science, forensics, or ballistics to solve cases (p.121), contrary to Hollywood dramas. A large metropolitan police department has many specialists. Its the personality that makes a detective: curiosity, aggressiveness, confidence, and perseverance. Pages 152-3 tell of the politics of justice in NY. A man who proffered the murder weapon and gave the order to rob was never charged with the murder. Did Dave flout the unwritten rules of style?<br />Page 124 tells of the \\"sociological phenomenon\\" where longtime residents migrated to the suburbs, and the result on the vacated neighborhoods. No clue here to solving this economic crime: who profited by this? Detectives aren't magicians, they can only work with what they have. Without witnesses or evidence (fingerprints) they can't break a case. It a witness of complainant won't testify, the case is closed. Pages 271-4 tell of the importance of proper testimony in court. They don't teach that in law school. If there are no witnesses to a murder, and no evidence of fingerprints left behind, the murder weapon not found, the murderer will not be targeted unless he tells someone (p.283). If he has a good alibi he might still get away, unless a detective gets a confession. Page 288 tells how \\"America's Most Wanted\\" helped to locate an alleged murderer. And the \\"War on Drugs\\" continues.	2003-03-03

These were chosen for balance, and edited to fit 192 pages. It has a list of organizations that may be contacted, but not the number of their memberships (tells how broad based they are). It lists 25 books on this topic, but does not summarize them. You should know that Bellesiles' book was discredited as an historical work, and W. Weir's book is better than the others. While unlisted, \\"The Minuteman\\" by Gary Hart is a history of the militia. Reading opposing views will educate you, but you should browse some of the books in your library for more depth. \\"Gun Control\\" is a euphemism for \\"gun prohibition\\". An aristocratic ruling class will always try to disarm the common people in order to oppress them (see Aristotle's \\"Politics\\"). After the Civil War the new corporate aristocracy attacked the Second Amendment. It took sixty years to destroy our \\"well-regulated militia\\" (1877-1934) and to attack \\"the right to keep and bear arms\\".<br /><br />Chapter 1 asks if private gun ownership poses a serious threat to society. It doesn't define \\"serious threat\\", or tell that every gun is \\"owned\\" by its user. Viewpoint 1 does not list a real person as the author. It claims that a weapon is dangerous and must be \\"regulated\\". It is an attempt to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms. It admits the murder rate increased after the 1968 Gun Control Act even when no firearm was used (p.20)! Most gun deaths result from suicide, not murder (p.22). Viewpoint 2 correctly points out that gun ownership has increased faster than the homicide rate (p.27), it is simple minded to claim the former caused the latter (pp. 26-27). Homicide rates fluctuate, and have tended to decline (p.28). \\"Gun Control\\" is a form of political oppression that leads to lower wages, higher taxes, or both. This poverty results in crime, so \\"gun control\\" really causes more crime. Viewpoint 3 uses rhetoric aboutan idyllic youth in East Orange NJ (before the Gun Control Act), but cites no facts in support. Page 32 suggests a biased outlook in the data collection by part of the CDC, and some part of the AMA has a political agenda against handguns. What means will they use to reach their desired end? Viewpoint 4 says the medical and public-health establishment produced research that was biased, riddled with errors, and unreliable (p.39). Page 40 gives one example of bias in the 'New England Journal of Medicine': censorship of the report that the homicide rate went up 25% in Vancouver since the 1977 Canadian law banning handguns! Page 43 tells of the flawed methodology used by A. Kellermann (the \\"43 times\\" fallacy). Kellermann's article did not use deaths in non-gun homes as a control; in the cases of a non-gun home you are 99 times more likely to kill a family member than an intruder. (Most deaths in the home are suicides.) Between 25 and 75 lives are saved by a gun for every life lost by a gun (p.44). Guns prevent harm to people, and protect property every day. When the discredited CDC gun control research was defunded, corporate millionaires began to pay for this slanted research (p.46). Viewpoint 5 is a good example of slick writing that doesn't really say much. The writer didn't do enough research (\\"dime-store novels\\"?). He mentions \\"the past three decades of gun violence\\" which echoes the fact that the 1968 Gun Control Act resulted in more crime and violence. Viewpoint 6 comes from a victim of a crazed shooter. This student of psychology has some insights into the \\"gun control\\" fantasy foisted upon the gullible who believe the corporate media. Who else has been exploited?<br /><br />Chapter 2 asks if the Constitution protects private ownership. The obvious answer is that it did until the 20th century, when the newly powerful corporate aristocracy sought to disarm the people. The phrase \\"a well-regulated militia\\" means armed citizens who elect their own officers; this ishow it worked from Colonial times onwards. \\"Well-regulated\\" also meant well-practiced. The \\"right of the people to keep and bear arms\\" also meant that people were required to own and carry arms, as in Colonial days. Note the word \\"arms\\"; there was no restriction intended on any type. Federal law still classifies all males (18 to 45) as the \\"unorganized militia\\". The Founding Fathers did not want a \\"select militia\\", one not composed of all the people. Viewpoint 1 explains why private ownership is protected by the Second Amendment. In Presser vs. Illinois (1886) the Supreme Court proclaimed that \\"the State cannot ... prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms\\" (p.64). In U.S. vs. Miller (1939) the Supreme Court did not deny the right to keep and bear arms, except in the narrow sense of the recently outlawed type of weapon used (pp. 64-65). This was a fixed case, since Miller was not represented in court! Recent Supreme Court decisions have not denied that \\"the people\\" means just what it says (pp. 65-67). Viewpoint 2 attacks the right to keep and bear arms. It implicitly admits this interpretation was created after the Civil War (p.70). The Miller decision was constructed to enforce the 1934 Firearms Act (banned sawed-off shotguns), another political decision. This introduced the concept of intent! It is dishonest to claim that Cruikshank does not apply to the Federal government (p.71), since the other Amendments do apply to the states (due process, equal representation, etc.). It is amusing to quote Hickman vs. Block 1996, since so many states have passed \\"right to carry\\" laws in the 1990s! Simmons speculates on the intent of gun advocates, but doesn't tell the truth about his own intentions. Viewpoint 3 explains why \\"gun control\\" (meaning 'gun prohibition') is unconstitutional. The Constitution does not contain the power to limit the ownership of arms. The Second Amendment positively forbids infringing the right to keep and bear arms. The Ninth Amendment saysthe people retain all rights not listed in the Constitution, such as the right of self-defense. The Tenth Amendment says powers not delegated to the Federal government are reserved to the people. This proves Congress has no Constitutional power to prohibit the keeping of arms by the people. Viewpoint 4 argues that gun control is constitutional. He admits that guns are not the root cause of violence, and, the news channels play up the tragedies. He admits the Founding Fathers wanted no limitations on the right to keep and bear arms (p.79). He claims \\"the correct interpretation\\" is to allow limits, but fails to see that this novel approach was created in the 20th century, once the corporate ruling class began to oppress the people (like any aristocracy in recorded history). The author tries to create fear and terror by recalling school shootings in a \\"gun free zone\\" (p.81). The obvious fact is that this never happened prior to the 1968 Gun Control Act.<br /><br />Chapter 3 asks if gun ownership is an effective means of self-defense. Viewpoint 1 says guns are effective for self-defense. Most news stories in the corporate media depict violent crime committed with guns, rarely the defensive use of guns. The author suggests this defensive use is largely unreported. If it prevents a crime, there is no report. And if the gun is not legally licensed, it will not be reported. (Every so often the NY city news reports where a crime was stopped because of action by a citizen; but the citizen was arrested because the gun wasn't licensed!) The absence of guns results in more \\"hot burglaries\\", where robbery occurs when the residents are home (p.90). The high rate of gun ownership makes all homes safer. Viewpoint 2 claims guns are not effective for self defense because people can't arm themselves quickly (trigger locks?), or arenot trained to shoot accurately (p.95). Most people are shot with handguns, not assault weapons; most people are not shot at work or school, but on a streetcorner or parking lot (drugs?), or the victim's home (pp.96-96). Viewpoint 3 says defensive gun use is common. It's better to have a gun and not need it than to need one and not have it. The corporate media considers foiled crimes as unnewsworthy (p.100). Most reported self-defense cases occur in the states that allow citizens to carry concealed weapons. The number of these can only be estimated, so controversy results (p.103). Gun prohibitionists want a small number to support their claims. While resisting an attack is risky, it is safer than not resisting. Viewpoint 4 claims defensive gun use is not common, and is more dangerous. No proof is given, except the discredited Kellermann article (\\"43 times more\\"). Kellermann's statistics came from homes where a violent death occurred from a gun. The cases of homes where a violent death occurred without a gun were not studied; there 99 times more residents were killed than intruders. While there are many times more guns than swimming pools, more children die from drowning than are accidentally shot. The number of defensive gun uses are not known, only estimates that reflect political biases (D. Hemenway, p.110). The author does not approve of the sale of defensive handguns, but doesn't think to ask what drives the demand. Hint: it isn't advertising in the corporate media. Viewpoint 5 says concealed weapons makes a safer society. States that allow this experience fewer violent crimes, and no increase in accidental deaths. Over 60% of the states allow concealed weapons. The authors answer five objections to this with facts. A handgun allows self-defense. Concealed handguns reduce crime (Vermont p.114). There was no increase in impulse killings. Training is required before a permit is issued. Concealed carrying does not increase gun accidents. Viewpoint 6 does NOT have a real person as the author! They claim that concealed weapons do not make society safer. On page 119 they talk about \\"11 states\\" will liberal CCW laws, on page 120 they say \\"29 states\\"; are they picking states to get at the results wanted? Their statistics seem to say that strict CCW laws do not eliminate violent crime! And that liberal CCW laws do not increase crime. Fluctuations in crime rates can be due to many factors (p.121). Increases in the crime rates were followed by liberal CCW laws in some states, and they they declined. 'Post hoc ergo propter hoc' applies to the thinking on either side of this issue. The increased crime rates in Great Britain after gun confiscation should tell you that \\"Handgun Control Incorporated\\" is plainly wrong!<br /><br />Chapter 4 asks \\"what measures would reduce gun violence?\\" and provides eight answers. Viewpoint 1 claims \\"gun control\\" will reduce lethal crime. The writer says criminal assaults and robberies are not higher in the United States than other developed countries, but the murder rate is much higher. (Actually, the rate of violent deaths in America is lower than in many European countries, and Japan.) Louisiana's murder rate is 20 times the rate of Vermont (which has little gun control). Cities have more murders than rural areas with guns. Page 130 mentions that none of the theories can explain this! But the writer claims that eliminating handguns would lower the number of homicides! Viewpoint 2 says gun control will not reduce violent crime; it is a failure in other countries. Japan's abolition of private gun ownership resulted in an increase of gun violence (p.132). This also happened in Australia and Great Britain (p.133). But in America violent crime continues to fall as the number of states with \\"shall issue\\" laws increase. Viewpoint 3 claims gun control will reduce school violence, because guns were used in the 1999 Columbine massacre. Yet prior to the 1968 Gun Control Act, most schools had rifle teams, guns were more handy, and no massacre ever happened! There were no monstrous high schools, MTV, video games, working mothers, and, less oppression of students. Viewpoint 4 says gun control will not reduce school violence, because firearms are obtained illegally. In spite of the corporate media attention, school violence is declining, and students are still safest in school (p.141). The Columbine killers illegally obtained their legally bought guns. Proposals made after this crime were flawed. Most gun violence is intentional, not accidental. Besides, the 1968 Gun Control Act was supposed to cure this! There are flaws in the criminal justice system (p.145). More people are deterred from crime by social standards, not laws (p.146). He suggests prevention programs need more funding (p.147). But there's big money in prison constructions and operation, and payoff to politicians that suggest early intervention programs will be skimped. Viewpoint 5 claims gun manufacturers should be held responsible for gun violence. But manufacturers of automobiles, baseball bats, knives, etc. are NOT responsible for their misuse! The CPHV tries to use the tort system to prosecute gun manufacturers for misuse of their products. Isn't this dishonest? The truth is that CPHV is using civil torts in an attempt to get guns outlawed since they can't accomplish this through legislation. This article has many half-truths and one-sided claims. It could be used as an example of sophisticated special pleading p.149-153). Viewpoint 6 says gun manufacturers should not be held responsible for gun violence since it allows courts to make laws that should be enacted by legislatures. Product liability law says manufacturers are not responsible for criminal or negligent misuse of non-defective products (p.157). Viewpoint 7 claims gun safety standards should be mandatory, and suggests some solutions. He also tells of the problem with each. None will prevent human error. Viewpoint 8 says gun safety standards should not be mandatory. There are risks in gun ownership as there are with flying or traveling in general. While 392 children were killed in gun accidents, 590 diedfrom medicine poisoning (childproof caps?), 1063 from burns, 1247 from drowning, 5503 from cars (p.175), and 200 from falls.	2003-03-02

It allowed continuous knowledge of Japanese plans and operations, and allowed victory against an enemy with sometimes greater forces. It enhanced the US submarine service against Japanese shipping. The author worked in Navy communications intelligence in Washington during the entire war. They read and translated intercepted messages. This 1978 book says FDR did not expect to provoke Japan into direct aggression against the United States (p.1). Scapegoats were found to placate a people shocked by Pearl Harbor, even if the scapegoats had not been told all (p.2). <br />If it is true that military leaders prepare for the next war from their experiences in the last war, it is also true that those who fail to learn from the past are destined to relive it. In 1904 Japan attacked the Russian Far Eastern Fleet before they declared war. Destroying their fleet won the war; Japan had no hope or plan to invade on land. The loss of Hawaii would push America back to the West Coast, and America would not pursue this war with Hitler's Germany in control of Europe. <br />America used the strategy of island-hopping to maximize its resources. They knew the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, their moves and countermoves. Destroying their merchant marine and oil tankers reduced their ability to defend effectively, and made attacks impossible. America's superior productive capacity and manpower would have won the war. Code breaking shortened the war by at least a year. This story on naval communications intelligence tells of the whole war in the Pacific, and other operations of the worldwide war.<br />On Jan 27, 1941 Ambassador Grew in Tokyo reported the talk that Japan would begin war with \\"a surprise mass attack on Pearl Harbor\\" (p.58). Naval Intelligence stated \\"no move against Pearl Harbor appears imminent\\". The book \\"Day of Deceit\\" suggests more was known than was told.<br />One mistake of the Japanese submariners was their disdain for merchant shipping. They learned nothing from WW I practices. Their pattern of shipping was not efficient either (p.153). The US knowledge of shipping location and contents allowed selective targets. Convoys were scorned because it was defensive, not offensive warfare. US submarines concentrated on tankers, this fuel shortage affected Japanese military operations (p.161).<br />Chapter 8 tells about island-hopping - bypassing some of the most powerful Japanese bases because of limited resources. This was fortunate, since it avoided a higher number of casualties. Chapter 9 tells about the battle of Leyte Gulf, and how Admiral Halsey withdrew his fleet from San Bernadino Strait. While the Japanese fleet passed without hindrance, Admiral Kinkaid's fleet at Surigao Strait stood guard (p.188). Chapter 10 tells of the plan to use strategic bombing and a naval blockade to bring about a surrender without an invasion of Japan (p.204). Chapter 11 notes that the new American empire after WW II was inevitably to be followed by a Time of Troubles (p.206). The Yalta Conference got Stalin's pledge to attack Japan three months after the surrender of Germany. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, and Japan surrendered on August 14.	2003-02-26

It has a bibliography, but no index. From the Hanoverians of 1714 until 1871 the British royal family was never popular. They were attacked in the press for profligacy, indolence, stupidity, or squalor. Page 3 tells how &quot;spin doctors&quot; and the British press turned public opinion in favor of the royal family. Yet they compared favorable to the royal houses on the continent. Their escapades in the 1990s are a return to past traditions.<br />Spain's rapid economic decline coincided with the reigns of mad rulers. The Habsburgs, Braganzas, Savoys, Hohenzollerns, and Wittelsbachs were inbred, insane, or both. While academic history books deal with trade or battles, they censor the personalities behind those events. The rulers called &quot;Great&quot; were not given that name for any good works. Until the 19th century royals were very often illiterate (like their subjects). History is as much about the madness of men as about social events. The more powerful a ruler, the greater the danger of his folly. So read about the last three centuries of European dynasties. Let's hope that it can't happen here, with an Imperial Presidency and Corporate Aristocracy!<br />This book appears to be a spicy confection. but there is whole wheat beneath the pink icing. This book teaches without preaching; the facts speak for themselves.<br />Page 95 gives the origin of &quot;God Save the King&quot;. The personality of Kaiser Bill is described on pages 144-8. The history of the Romanovs is on pages 151-188. Did you wonder what the world lost in that dynasty? The frequent absences from England by George I was the reason for the creation of a Prime Minister (p.193). During the reign of George V many of the royal rituals were invented. The symbol of a royal family as an example of marital fidelity, good manners, and religious devotion was also created (p.276). The royal family needed popularity to survive. Since the Battle of Hastings, England was ruled by six families, none of them English (p.281). Chapter 9 tells about the Windsors; the most important dynasty left in Europe.	2003-02-25

These were chosen for balance, and edited to fit 192 pages. It has a list of organizations that may be contacted, but not the number of their memberships (tells how broad based they are). It lists 25 books on this topic, but does not summarize them. You should know that Bellesiles' book was discredited as an historical work, and W. Weir's book is better than the others. While unlisted, &#34;The Minuteman&#34; by Gary Hart for a history of the militia. Reading opposing views will educate you, but you should browse some of the books in your library for more depth. &#34;Gun Control&#34; is a euphemism for &#34;gun prohibition&#34;. An aristocratic ruling class will always try to disarm the common people in order to oppress them (see Aristotle's &#34;Politics&#34;). After the Civil War the new corporate aristocracy attacked the Second Amendment. It took sixty years to destroy our &#34;well-regulated militia&#34; (1877-1934) and to attack &#34;the right to keep and bear arms&#34;.   Chapter 1 asks if private gun ownership poses a serious threat to society. It doesn't define &#34;serious threat&#34;, or tell that every gun is &#34;owned&#34; by its user. Viewpoint 1 does not list a real person as the author. It claims that a weapon is dangerous and must be &#34;regulated&#34;. It is an attempt to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms. It admits the murder rate increased after the 1968 Gun Control Act even when no firearm was used (p.20)! Most gun deaths result from suicide, not murder (p.22). Viewpoint 2 correctly points out that gun ownership has increased faster than the homicide rate (p.27), it is simple minded to claim the former caused the latter (pp. 26-27). Homicide rates fluctuate, and have tended to decline (p.28). &#34;Gun Control&#34; is a form of political oppression that leads to lower wages, higher taxes, or both. This poverty results in crime, so &#34;gun control&#34; really causes more crime. Viewpoint 3 uses rhetoric about an idyllic youth in East Orange NJ (before the Gun Control Act), but cites no facts in support. Page 32 suggests a biased outlook in the data collection by part of the CDC, and some part of the AMA has a political agenda against handguns. What means will they use to reach their desired end? Viewpoint 4 says the medical and public-health establishment produced research that was biased, riddled with errors, and unreliable (p.39). Page 40 gives one example of bias in the 'New England Journal of Medicine': censorship of the report that the homicide rate went up 25% in Vancouver since the 1977 Canadian law banning handguns! Page 43 tells of the flawed methodology used by A. Kellermann (the &#34;43 times&#34; fallacy). Kellermann's article did not use deaths in non-gun homes as a control; in the cases of a non-gun home you are 99 times more likely to kill a family member than an intruder. (Most deaths in the home are suicides.) Between 25 and 75 lives are saved by a gun for every life lost by a gun (p.44). Guns prevent harm to people, and protect property every day. When the discredited CDC gun control research was defunded, corporate millionaires began to pay for  this slanted research (p.46). Viewpoint 5 is a good example of slick writing that doesn't really say much. The writer didn't do enough research (&#34;dime-store novels&#34;?). He mentions &#34;the past three decades of gun violence&#34; which echoes the fact that the 1968 Gun Control Act resulted in more crime and violence. Viewpoint 6 comes from a victim of a crazed shooter. This student of psychology has some insights into the &#34;gun control&#34; fantasy foisted upon the gullible who believe the corporate media. Who else has been exploited?  Chapter 2 asks if the Constitution protects private ownership. The obvious answer is that it did until the 20th century, when the newly powerful corporate aristocracy sought to disarm the people. The phrase &#34;a well-regulated militia&#34; means armed citizens who elect their own officers; this is how it worked from Colonial times onwards. &#34;Well-regulated&#34; also meant well-practiced. The &#34;right of the people to keep and bear arms&#34; also meant that people were required to own and carry arms, as in Colonial days. Note the word &#34;arms&#34;; there was no restriction intended on any type. Federal law still classifies all males (18 to 45) as the &#34;unorganized militia&#34;. The Founding Fathers did not want a &#34;select militia&#34;, one not composed of all the people. Viewpoint 1 explains why private ownership is protected by the Second Amendment. In Presser vs. Illinois (1886) the Supreme Court proclaimed that &#34;the State cannot ... prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms&#34; (p.64). In U.S. vs. Miller (1939) the Supreme Court did not deny the right to keep and bear arms, except in the narrow sense of the recently outlawed type of weapon used (pp. 64-65). This was a fixed case, since Miller was not represented in court! Recent Supreme Court decisions have not denied that &#34;the people&#34; means just what it says (pp. 65-67). Viewpoint 2 attacks the right to keep and bear arms. It implicitly admits this interpretation was created after the Civil War (p.70). The Miller decision was constructed to enforce the 1934 Firearms Act (banned sawed-off shotguns), another political decision. This introduced the concept of intent! It is dishonest to claim that Cruikshank does not apply to the Federal government (p.71), since the other Amendments do apply to the states (due process, equal representation, etc.). It is amusing to quote Hickman vs. Block 1996, since so many states have passed &#34;right to carry&#34; laws in the 1990s! Simmons speculates on the intent of gun advocates, but doesn't tell the truth about his own intentions. Viewpoint 3 explains why &#34;gun control&#34; (meaning 'gun prohibition') is unconstitutional. TheConstitution does not contain the power to limit the ownership of arms. The Second Amendment positively forbids infringing the right to keep and bear arms. The Ninth Amendment says the people retain all rights not listed in the Constitution, such as the right of self-defense. The Tenth Amendment says powers not delegated to the Federal government are reserved to the people. This proves Congress has no Constitutional power to prohibit the keeping of arms by the people. Viewpoint 4 argues that gun control is constitutional. He admits that guns are not the root cause of violence, and, the news channels play up the tragedies. He admits the Founding Fathers wanted no limitations on the right to keep and bear arms (p.79). He claims &#34;the correct interpretation&#34; is to allow limits, but fails to see that this novel approach was created in the 20th century, once the corporate ruling class began to oppress the people (like any aristocracy in recorded history). The author tries to create fear and terror by recalling school shootings in a &#34;gun free zone&#34; (p.81). The obvious fact is that this never happened prior to the 1968 Gun Control Act.	2003-02-20

Keep this in mind as you read this book.<br />On p.4 he claims \\"an astounding high level of personal violence separates the U.S. from every other industrial nation\\", but he gives no proof for his claim. It seems like the \\"argument from ignorance\\" logical fallacy. More violence than in Brazil, Argentina, or Mexico? They all had similar historical development in this hemisphere. Or is he talking about western Europe, where Social Democratic policies have long be in use? On p.5 he argues that guns only became common in the mid-nineteenth century, and were concentrated in urban areas! Could it be that people own guns, and people were concentrated in urban areas? He also claims the U.S. government worked to arm its citizens, but gives no proof on this page.<br />On p.6 he claims \\"car magazines ... often publish articles highly critical of the automotive industry\\" but can give no proof. When I read these magazines I saw they lavishly praised the products advertised in their pages. Do they condemn products NOT advertised? Don't the other hobby magazines operate the same way? On p.7 he mentions the \\"view that citizens have a constitutionally protected right to own machine guns\\". But don't the citizens of Sweden and Switzerland have that right, even without a Second Amendment? Perhaps it has something to do with being peaceful and neutral?<br />On p.12 he seems to use the lack of records for proof that there was no \\"American gun culture\\". (But who invented this phrase?) Some of the reviews say his research can not be duplicated, and he destroyed or discarded his notes. Was that a responsible scholarly act? On p.13 he says he examined more than a thousand probate records from northern New England and western Pennsylvania. The vagueness of these locations makes it difficult to check his research. On p.14 he claims there was not \\"well-armed public\\" before 1850! Did Patrick Henry or Eldridge Gerry say so?<br />On p.15 he talks about deer hunters in New York. He compares the PERCENTAGE of muzzle-loader hunters to the NUMBERS of deer culled by archers! He ignores the length and timing of these seasons; would a truth-seeking scholar do this? He doesn't say if the archers later went hunting with guns. On pages 20-22 he tells of the need to keep firearms from the hands of the common people. And THAT is today's motive for \\"gun control\\" - you can't oppress a well-armed people either in Aristotle's time or today. And you don't have to ban a product if people don't want it.<br />Reading the rest of the book is left as an exercise to the student. Will it be as like the first pages?	2003-02-19
1222980:US	38002140	R2O4W863PIHAZL	0938349570	987606657	The Eagle and the Raven	Books	3	8	10	N	N	A Short History of Two Men Who met in 1836	The Prologue tells about his past writings, and why he kept writing into his 80s: his job is to tell stories. This book was intended to be a chapter in his novel 'Texas', but was dropped because it was history and not part of the novel. Michener's reject can stand alone as a concise history of these men. Pages 29-30 notes his solid rules of work at 80: rise at 7:30, eat a frugal breakfast, write until 12:30. Eat a light lunch, take a nap, do research and teaching, then a brisk mile walk at dusk. Supper, the evening news, maybe TV, and the day ends. Michener lived to a ripe old age, after a quintuple heart by-pass, new left hip, dental rebuilding, and vertigo. Like an old apple tree, he kept on growing and producing. These pages are worth reading in themselves.<br />The book gives a concise history into the parallel lives of Santa Anna and Sam Houston. Both were destined to be famous politicians in their countries, but never did overcome their flaws. But how many of out politicians do when the historians release the uncensored facts?<br />Santa Anna won renown by his military action against the many rebellions. They were put down by executing most of the captured rebels, or making them imprisoned slaves. Santa Anna's talents lay in knowing just when to change sides. One morning Santa Anna led his troops against the rebels and was promoted to Lt Colonel. After lunch, he joined the rebels and was promoted to full Colonel! Santa Anna later supported Emperor Iturbide and became a General. All this suggests the Founding Fathers were right to require a small standing Army, and keep the professional military out of politics. This book does not explain who Santa Anna was fronting for; you'll need to read a more detailed history book. Page 112 tells of Santa Anna's use of double agents: military officers who pretended to defect to the Zacatecans, then betrayed the Zacatecan forces who also rebelled against the coup de etat.<br />The Mexican defeat at San Jacinto led to the capture of Santa Anna. Houston showed his political wisdom by  getting Santa Anna to sign a treaty to be released. A live Santa Anna would try to justify his actions, and prevent another general from becoming ruler, and maybe starting another war against the smaller Texas. Houston became President of Texas, US Senator, then Governor. Houston opposed the Confederacy, and was removed from office. What would have happened if Houston used Union troops to stay in office? Could it have succeeded? At 68 Houston must have felt he had done as much as he could do in one lifetime. Houston retired to his farm and died in 1863 at 70 years.<br />Santa Anna was recalled from exile to lead Mexico into the war with America. Their defeat led to the loss of huge areas. Santa Anna was the most expensive President Mexico ever had! (I wonder if Santa Anna was a member of a Secret Society and a double agent? That would explain a lot.) Ever the opportunist, he backed the conservatives who invited Maximilian to be Emperor of Mexico. When the reign of Maximilian was on the wane, Santa Anna switched sides yet again. His one gift to America was to introduce chewing gum, a substitute for the ubiquitous chewing tobacco. Santa Anna returned to Mexico City a few years before his death to live in poverty and obscurity.	2003-02-19

Books	4	16	19	N	N	First Book to Investigate this Unsolved Mystery	This book should be read by anyone who still believes in the conclusions of the Warren Commission. This long essay was first published in the Paris weekly \\"L' Express\\" in 1964. It lacks an index and chapter headings, but applies common sense to the reported stories to refute the \\"lone gunman\\" theory. A few hours after JFK's death, a suspect was arrested although there were no witnesses and no confessions! We were told Oswald was a fanatical Communist who hated America. Was this too good to be true? The fact that Oswald was never a member of the Communist party, or the \\"Fair Play for Cuba\\" group was omitted from the news reports. Never has such an intricate murder been so swiftly settled, without a confession of eyewitnesses!<br />Buchanan explains why neither Soviet Russia or Cuba could benefit from JFK's death (pp. 17-21). The first people to claim JFK was murdered by a Communist were just earlier attacking JFK as pro-Communist! Who was pulling their strings? Buchanan states that Oswald could only have been convicted if he was innocent (p.24)! But if he knew how the crime had happened, he would be silenced (p.26). Oswald's assassination by Jack Ruby proclaims that Oswald was not a lone gunman, and powerful forces were threatened by Oswald's existence and talking. Nothing over the last forty years has disproved this.<br />Buchanan recalls the political circumstances of the assassinations of Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley. You'll find a description of these crimes, and their history, that is skipped in scholastic history books. The important point is that all were done for political reasons, and not of the assassins were crazy. Anything else is just a cover-up (see 'Time' of 11-29-1963). Page 72 explains why Oswald was not insane: he tried to escape, and plead 'not guilty' when arrested. The premeditation says it was not temporary insanity (p.73). Page 91 says the official conclusion was based on the Bethesda autopsy. (Decades later we learned that this 'best evidence' was based on the body of JFK's double, sacrificed to provide proof of a lone gunman firing from the rear. See \\"High Treason 2\\" for these pictures.) Pages 93-97 discuss the number of shots, and the impossibility of three shots in less than 6 seconds from a bolt-action rifle. A bullet that struck JFK at that angle could not have struck Governor Connally's back only a few inches lower, and remained intact.<br />Page 148 mentions Senator Kefauver's 1951 probe into criminal activities in New York, where the police, judges, politicians, and gangsters shared the loot. In the 1930s Senator LaFollette had a similar investigation that showed underworld forces were used by corporations against labor unions. Organized crime is often used to carry out tasks that can't be handled by legal means. The first Gallup poll had 52% believing Oswald represented an extreme right-wing group, gangsters, or some \\"unknown\\" force (p.152).<br />Pages 155-6 note the strange behavior of Oswald in the Marine Corps, which implies he was being trained as a secret agent. I believe it is routine to take a smart and talented recruit from the lower classes to use as a secret agent; they are expendable! While they denied Oswald worked for the FBI or CIA, nobody mentioned the obvious: Naval Intelligence. Page 178 tells of the Dallas ruling class, the how the oil business controls them.	2003-02-16
1228448:US	38002140	R3IDRKCQU5ZZZ	0813506573	730622098	Where Cities Meet the Urbanization of New Jersey	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Snapshot of NJ in 1964	This is a concise history of NJ, and why things developed as they did. It tends to avoid discussing certain controversial problems (p.76). Urbanization in NJ resulted from the 19th century industrial revolution, and the current technological revolution. They affected a larger proportion of NJ than any other state. Even if over 70% of the state is &#34;undeveloped&#34; (p.4) there is a heavy concentration or people in certain areas. The population of NJ is about equal to Montana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, and Arizona, whose area is about 95 times greater. NJ is divided into 567 incorporated municipalities. The 'suburb&#34; is an idea of a mainly residential place outside of a central city, with its own political control. NJ's character is determined by its geographical location, the land bridge between New York and Philadelphia, the first two cities from Colonial times onward.<br /><br />In 1687 the Colony was divided into East Jersey and West Jersey, the first oriented to New York, the other to Philadelphia. There was greater diversity than New England's religious ethic, or the southern colonies' planter aristocracy. County government predominated in sparsely populated West Jersey, while town government met the needs of more populated East Jersey. NJ had many navigable rivers. As a corridor state in Colonial times, it became the site for many Revolutionary War battles. This war brought more physical destruction and social disorganization than any other colony except South Carolina. After the US Constitution was adopted, the economy began to expand, like other states (no tariff barriers). Urbanization grew in the center strip connecting Philadelphia to New York.<br /><br />The War of 1812, the embargo and blockade, promoted home industry and overland travel. Canals and then railroads were built from the 1830s; they connected to either New York or Philadelphia. Manufacturing shifted from the artisan in the home to workers in the factory. More urbanized area were incorporated into municipalities, allowing the residents control of roads, water, sewers, police, fire districts, building codes, and public schools.

But the PC was only a means to an end, not the end in itself. Look up Credit Mobiliere, and the many scams in late 19th century railroads (the high-tech dot-coms of that day). Look up the changed laws, and accounting methods, from the late 1970s for fixing these deals. RXC claims it \\"happened more or less by accident\\" - not true; they met a need. The personal computer is to mainframe computers like the personal automobile is to railroad trains.     Page 9 notes that Wozniak, Jobs, and Gates were college dropouts who disdained academia. Didn't Edward Land also do this? Page 40 says Noyce expanded production and not prices to grow volume and profits; ever hear of the Ford Model T? Page 43 tells a story about teleprocessing, but RXC doesn't understand the AT&T monopoly and 1200 baud modems of 40 years ago. Page 58 explains the invention of the BIOS. Pages 77-80 explains the difference between basic research and research and development, and what it means.     The concept of \\"metaprogrammer\\" (nee Chief Programmer in 1966 Poughkeepsie) is discussed on pages 108-110. It gets the job done, but has a great political problem. If control is localized, so is blame. Most projects are decreed by upper management, but blame descends on the lower orders. Need I say more? Page 110 says this is like \\"collective farming\\" which didn't work well. Doesn't it work when it is voluntary, but not when imposed from above? Collective farming does away with owner operated units and turns them into wage earners; this is how our agribusiness works today. Did RXC ever personally investigate this? Page 113 tells of the problem in making all decisions at the top. First, it restricts parallel operations by creating a bottleneck. Then it prevents making decisions at the appropriate level. It doesn't distinguish between technical and political or design problems (which must be solved at a higher level). But if only inexperienced programmers are wanted, that creates a self-limiting environment as well. Page 124 says Ross Perot left IBM because he filled his sales quote in January; wasn't there some conflict of interest caused by his second job? Page 128 tells a story about Digital Research in July 1980 that may be incomplete. Page 166 explains the reason for PC-compatible, and why other computer manufacturers foundered. Page 261 tells how Aldus was suckered into not producing a word processor for Windows in 1989. Page 268 tells how Apple's money paid for Microsoft's international expansion. Page 281 explains how Microsoft takes a stab at new technology. Page 303 says Sun \\"practically gives away system software\\". Since 1961 the Federal Govt. paid for Multics (and its clones), and ordered this for computer science's on-line needs. What would Sun charge if it had to build it all itself? RXC predicted the death of mainframes on 12/31/99, but I missed reading the obituary notices. There have been great changes since 1999, but not as predicted in this book. Page 307 has other predictions! Page 315 mentions the \\"software studio\\" model, but doesn't ask who on Wall Street will put up the venture capital to make \\"Rocky 1010\\"? RXC did NOT predict the INTERNET, a kinder, gentler version of Orwell's \\"1984\\" that allows Big Brother to spy on activity in your home (p.350)! Page 322 describes the value of being late and over budget. Chapter 17 makes predictions again.	2003-02-13

Davidson has written books on other topics; he has no background on this one. OGD did try to hold back his biases, but they slipped out in many places. Chapter 1 tells of “The Stockton Lesson” and how it was exploited by Gun Prohibitionists to further their agenda. The real lesson is that the Establishment refused to hospitalize a sick, deranged individual; they would prefer to exploit any crazy attack that occurs in a “gun free zone”. How many other walking time bombs are being released in the hopes of another incident? OGD’s criticism of the volunteer NRA (p.22) shows he doesn’t understand “Democracy in America”; DeTocqueville stated that voluntary association was the basis of democracy in America. Pages 28 29 document no infringement on the right to keep and bear arms, then. OGD does NOT mention the name of the group that paid for “sweeping legislation to ban or regulate a wide variety of firearms” (p.29). Pages 35 39 show how the NRA is a democratic organization responsible to its members. Compare that to the “Million Mom March Inc.”, or the major political parties! The 1968 Gun Control Act banned mail order sales of guns and ammunition, even though this leaves a paper trail, and provides a delay for cross checking!<br /><br />Pages 63 81 has a good summary on the passage of the McClure Volkmer law, reports that are usually censored in the corporate media. OGD’s writing shows his bias here. Page 69 shows the difference between the politically appointed Justice Department and popular elected House members. Page 50 mentions a description of ATF as “jackbooted group of fascists ... a danger to American society”, but doesn’t mention why. Could it be Waco? There is no mention of Ruby Ridge either. Read the book “Tainting Evidence” for good information on both events. There is another deliberately misleading or false statement on page 121. The rate of violent deaths in America is less than in Japan, but ahead of Canada. See how OGD constructs sentences to hide this fact! This is the typical dishonesty of Gun Prohibitionists. OGD also mentions the high gunshot death rate among young black males. Does this underline their oppression in our society? Psychologists know that concentrating laboratory rats creates aggression and violence. Are urban ghettos a “kinder, gentler” version of concentration camps? Hubert Humphrey wanted “good jobs at good wages”; didn’t he also attack the 1968 Gun Control Act when running for President? Since crime is very low in South Dakota and Vermont (no gun control laws), could “gun control” be a scheme to generate business for urban hospitals (p.122)? Since 1987, 33 of the other 48 states passed “right to carry” laws that overturned WW I era laws. The book “More Guns, Less Crime” reports the results.<br /><br />Another dishonest statement is on page 129: “opinion polls have showed consistent support for gun control”. The 1976 Massachusetts referendum to ban all hand guns was soundly defeated! The truth is that these polls are rigged to get the answer that is desired! Page 135 shows another deliberate distortion of the Second Amendment. Those who passed the Bill of Rights did NOT want only the Federal Military to “keep and bear arms”. That quote by W. Burger suggests the contrariness that accompanies senility. You will find William Weir’s “A Well Regulated Militia: The Battle over Gun Control” a better and more informative book. The author doesn’t explain the politics of a “waiting period”. This would prevent sales at weekend gun shows! Shutting down the computer would simply prevent all sales as well.gan was for it. Isn't that a self-serving statement? Didn't his biographer say he was senile in his second term? Page 202 mentions reports that were \\"almost uniformly exaggerated or wholly fabricated\\", an admission of biased reporting. Page 215 tells of the trick pulled to report out the DeConcini bill. Arlen Spector created the \\"magic bullet\\" theory used to explain the shooting of JFK and Governor Connally by a lone gunman. <br />OGD doesn't explain the politics of a \\"waiting period\\". This would prevent sales at weekend gun shows! Shutting down the computer would simply prevent all sales as well. Page 277 shows OGD believes Kellerman's story (a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to kill a family member than an intruder). Read the article yourself to see its limitations. In homes without a gun you are 99 times more likely to kill a family member than an intruder. Hint: most violent deaths in the home are suicides; \\"died at home\\" is a code word for this in obituaries. OGD again shows his prejudice when he says \\"gun violence\\" (p.282). Half of all gun deaths are suicides; they can't be prevented by a fantasy like \\"childproof guns\\". Maybe you would do better to read \\"Armed\\" by Kleck and Kates on this topic.	2003-02-06

Elephants can do heavy towing, or push aside obstacles; they can't pirouette en pointe. This book is the viewpoint of IBM by an outside journalist. It lacks a table of contents. The book describes the problems, it does not tell when or why it originated.<br />Page 20 says IBM developed &quot;a lush bureaucracy that prided itself on having a higher ratio of managers per employee than any other business around.&quot; Is this what they teach in business school? IBM's chairmen came from the sales force; if you can't sell it, there's no point in making it. The IBM PC was created from off-the-shelf parts so it could be quickly marketed; pre-defined interfaces too! Page 24 tells how Microsoft did an operating system: they licensed QDOS (a replica of CP/M), then bought it. It eventually made Gates the richest man in America.<br />Page 27 tells of the management problem in creating software. Architects spent months producing detailed designs for software. Then masses of programmers had a hard time deciphering the hundreds of pages of specifications. More time was spent in communicating than actually writing code! Isn't this a recipe for a project to be over budget and behind schedule? Estridge's habit of shunning meetings, not returning phone call, and ignoring unwanted advice could set an example of a well-ordered project manager who concentrates on the mission, not the housekeeping. Page 37 explains why standards for PCs began at birth.<br />Page 53 mentions the &quot;fear of nuclear attack&quot; as the reason for moving out of New York city. But other companies also moved out in the 1970s; the fear of a nuclear attack drained away after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Didn't IBM build a skyscraper in the 1980s only to sell it in the 1990s? Didn't AT&amp;T do the same?<br />Page 87 tells how Gates got lucky when VisiCorp began to self-destruct. Those familiar with counter-intelligence operations maythink of another reason (p.192). Page 97 says IBM never wanted to have too many people in one spot. Unstated here is the fear that nearly all could walk out to a new company (p.186). Page 101 tells that IBM used lines of code as a measure of programming; what did IBM use to measure its management? Microsoft rewrote IBM code to make it faster and smaller, then; how are they doing now? The last pages of Chapter 8 deal with the OS/2-Windows politics. There is no explanation as to why they didn't share the same application interface. Page 201 tells of developing a RISC chip; didn't CDC do this in the early 1960s? Page 208 describes the chip development problem in Burlington VT. Page 217 mentions the &quot;golden screwdriver&quot; and how quickly some machines were upgraded. Think ahead!<br />Pages 245-7 tell of the PS/1 project: crippled so it would not compete with PS/2. Would General Motors restrict the sale of Chevrolets to sell more Cadillacs? Page 281 suggests Microsoft moles reported on IBM's strategies. Pages 301-9 tell of the changes in Lexington under new owners. In political history, this is like a revolution that sweeps away the aristocracy and lets the farmers and merchants rise to power. Does the description of the IBM bureaucracy remind you of France before the Revolution? Will anyone write a book to cover the last ten years as well as this one does?	2003-02-06

Acclaimed as a strategist, he left no maxims. His passage through the Alps, with elephants, remains a mystery. While the destruction of Carthage meant a loss of writing, it seems they kept few records. The Carthagenians were the first great trading nation. Their north African lands did not get the rains as in Europe. The Romans expanded by land, the Carthagenians by sea. Carthage relied on foreign mercenaries, Rome on her citizen army. <br />The conflict in Rome 219 BC seems familiar. The Senate (the rich) was interested in foreign conquest and the riches from trade. The Assembly (the common folk) wanted to work their farms and not be sacrificed in a foreign war that brought them no benefits. But the silver mines in Spain would pay for the costs of war. Envoys were sent to Carthage to settle the dispute. The Roman Fabius asked them to choose war or peace; they replied it was Rome's choice. So Rome chose war. (The Roman Republic was about ten times the size in population over Carthage.)<br />Hannibal's invasion of northern Italy forced Rome to send their army there, this prevented the invasion of Carthage. Hannibal crossed the Alps north of the coast to bring his army to meet his allies in Cisalpine Gaul. When confronted by the Roman army, he offered freedom to the slaves who fought. The Romans were well trained and disciplined; but Hannibal knew they could not handle a strange threat. Hannibal released all prisoners so they could return home (and tell of the Roman defeat); he also sought the support of Rome's allies. Hannibal's skill as a general was shown at the battle of Cannae, which destroyed the Roman army. But Rome and its allies still outnumbered Carthage.<br />Hannibal found friends among the conquered cities and people of Italy. Roman rule usually benefitted the nobility and landowners, not the peasantry of the villages or the common folk of the towns. Being nice to the current rulers goes back quite a while, long before the XXth Century. While Hannibal and his allies were not attacked by land, the Romans controlled the sea. Roman subjects complained of their high taxes and unequal treatment. Roman Censors sniffed out complainers like the secret police in today's world. Hannibal's new allies had the problems of old rivalries.<br />Scipio convinced the Roman Senate to let him attack Carthage, rather than the wily Hannibal secure in northern Italy. The Roman successes in north Africa resulted in Hannibal's recall to Carthage. At the battle of Zama the Romans slowly advanced; then their horsemen attacked the back of the Carthagenian forces. This defeat ended the war. Carthage became a friend and ally of Rome, surrendering war material and paying an indemnity.<br />The wealthy rulers of Carthage did not like the new tax on wealth. Hannibal proposed to meet the yearly indemnity payment without new taxes. He reformed the tax system, and improved agriculture. The government was renovated by yearly elections, no longer by hereditary privilege. Rumors of another war reached Rome; they sent investigators to Carthage, and Hannibal left for the land of Antiochus. This war against Rome also failed. Hannibal travelled further east to Bythinia. In time, Rome learned of his presence and tried to capture him. Hannibal then escaped all earthy pursuit.	2003-02-04

Don't Let the Facts Get in the Way of a Good Story! Those who work for a company know that certain policies cannot be questioned; your manager's opinions are best left unchallenged. After three decades at CBS Bernard Goldberg discovered this fact also applies to media workers! The corporate lifeblood of advertising depends on telling people what to think and buy. What insider can question this? Corporate workers know what policies and viewpoints will help you get ahead, even if you do not have a relative in upper management. Its not just dressing for for success, but politically correct thinking.<br />BG says \\"the networks tilt left\\" (p.2) but provides no proof. Are they advocating a Canadian-style health care system? Are they seeking to nationalize the military-industrial complex, or end corporate controlled agriculture? Are they asking for higher income tax rates? Or are they merely presenting \\"feel good\\" news to sedate their viewers? Hollywood knows their audiences favor a happy ending; why shouldn't there be \\"happy news\\"? <br />BG writes \\"network news ... steals just about everything from print\\" (p.25). So they merely echo the news from Establishment leaders like the 'New York Times' or 'Washington Post'. He doesn't tell who controls these newspapers; he sees the trees but not the forest.<br />Page 32 quotes Dan Rather: \\"you just try to tell me how to report the news\\". Don't his managers do that every day? Can Dan ever deviate from reading his script on TV? (I once was him apologize to the TV camera when he stumbled over the script he had to recite.) And Dan never uses his Texan accent either!<br />Corporate broadcasts of the news use it as a vehicle for advertising. It must be that a \\"liberal bias\\" sells, and other styles don't; the bottom line commands attention. Nothing in this book denies that \\"liberal bias\\" reflects the policies of their corporate owners. <br />\\"The first step in controlling a communicable disease is to determine who is getting it and how\\"(p.89). Do people catch \\"liberal bias\\" by living in small rural towns? Do they catch it from working in urban financial centers like New York, San Francisco, or Atlanta? Do they get it from studies in college? BG needs to document this disorder better. If journalists are more \\"liberal\\" than the general public could it be a type of industrial disease? They do learn more about what's happening, and how the news is censored; it could make them more cynical.<br />Chapter 11 has an important and under-reported story: the decline of \\"child well-being\\". Does the absence of parents result in poor learning, drug abuse, and other evils? Do corporations profit from working mothers, convenient fast-foods, and remedial schooling? Does the media profit from their advertising? BG says this failure to report is caused by laziness (p.167), but the real answer may be that it would reduce the profits of their advertisers.<br />Page 172 says that children in day care tend to be more aggressive and defiant: argue a lot, demand a lot of attention, act cruelly, slow explosive behavior, talk too much, and get into a lot of fights. (Is this Pavlovian conditioning?) The increasing number of children in early day care exactly coincides with the epidemic of childhood asthma (p.176). The news that day care results in more respiratory tract infections was censored from the newspapers (p.177). BG doesn't ask if this is due to advertisers, he just says the \\"media elites\\" kept it hidden!	2003-02-04

Parker. It does not seem to match Chandler's earlier work. Perhaps because it echoes these and other stories?<br />Some anachronisms jarred my reading. I can believe Linda driving a Fleetwood convertible in 1959 or 1969, but they were long obsolete by 1989. While scandals from nude photos were believable then, the weekly magazines and newspapers have inured us since the 1970s. Unless it involved an elected official, and maybe not even then. Marlowe seems to drive around without ever getting caught in traffic, too. Is LA like that? At 42, does his attitudes reflect other baby boomers? The story involves a gambling establishment outside the city limits. Would either the FBI or Calif pass up a chance to raid it since the 1960s? Wouldn't a casino in Nevada be more likely? The sun-drenched streets of pre-war Los Angeles (\\"the best trolley system in the country\\") have been long replaced by the smog and gloom of Big Oil's Freeways. \\"Roger Rabbit\\" treated this as background for a cartoon.<br />The square miles of land around LA were worthless because there was no trolley system there. Destroying the trolley system put people into cars. Now these distant lands became commercially valuable. Newspaper owners benefitted when they were developed. Even bigger forces were at work to bring in Government contracts, and factories from out or state. The northeast was drained to irrigate southern California. And all perfectly legal!<br />The ending is different from \\"The Big Sleep\\", and it seems more cynical to wrap it up with a 'deus ex machina' ending. TBS let the guilty walk because they were rich and powerful, and doesn't it still happen that way? Not just in LA? A better ending would find the suicided Larry Victor with a typed but unsigned confession, and the widow Valentine hospitalized for a nervous breakdown.	2003-02-01

This book has a short history of the years 1848 to 1865 to fill the gaps in your knowledge. These years marked the continental dimensions of the United States, and the evolving policies towards the Native Americans. The military met hostile conditions of climate and geography unlike east of the Mississippi.<br />Chapter One begins at the end of the Mexican War; an army of 100,000 officers and men invaded a foreign country and defeated forces five times their number. The Army's priority was still on westward expansion: travel routes and settlements. Mineral wealth (gold, silver) was the most important; agriculture followed later. A standing army distasteful to the Founding Fathers became a necessity in expanding the American Republic into a Continental power. While the Militia was useful, only the Regular Army could be supported by national tax dollars.<br />The many Indian tribes were never united, and often fought among themselves as with the white settlers. The Army had to protect settlers and peaceful Indians from hostile Indians, and peaceful Indians from white settlers. The Indians knew how to live in these lands, and to take advantage of the environment. Most were partially or wholly nomadic. Their culture centered on war and its rewards. Their loose social organization exalted the individual at the expense of the group; no chief's word could bind his people. This caused conflict with the whites who could not understand this way of life. They would never attack unless they could win, and otherwise quickly disappeared from the enemy. The Army could win by operating as a disciplined team against fragmented warriors (seeking individual combat as in Medieval times). The Army also had howitzers (\\"guns that shot twice\\"), and rifles that could reach their enemy before threatened by smooth bore muskets. The Indian tribes could not unite for a vigorous and sustained offense or defense.<br />Chapter Ten tells how the Army was organized in the Civil War. The Volunteers were the great citizen armies that bore the brunt of the fighting. They were organized by state governors and mustered into US service for 6 to 24 months. Their officers were appointed by governors, general officers by the President. The Militia were also organized by the Governors, but could not serve outside of their state or territory. The Regular Army was enlarged for the war. Most recruits chose the Volunteers for their enlistment bounties and shorter terms of service. Many of the Volunteers were used for the Indian wars, including \\"Galvanized Yankees\\" (Confederate prisoners released for this duty). Their job was to protect the wagon trains on the trails, the stations, and the telegraph lines. They provided business for contractors and neighboring towns.<br />Chapter Sixteen provides a summary of the preceding chapters. One development was the winter campaign. A stationary tribe would be attacked, their food and lodgings destroyed, their only survival lay in reaching an Indian Agency. Another was total war, the deliberate killing of women and children, even if against law and tradition (pp 345-6). Such actions outraged the humanitarian sensibilities of easterners. There was conflict between the military and civil branches of the government.	2003-01-30

Forces are withdrawn from areas not worth contesting to reinforce areas where the battle is critical. Having accomplished his mission, the general retires. The kingdom is now in better shape for having shed their colonies. THINK of an overloaded lifeboat (Boston case in 1850s). The first mate reduces the number of passengers, allowing most to survive. The blame should be on the situation, not the correction. (My condolences for those thrown overboard.) Or pick your own parable.<br /><br />This is written for a general audience, but not everyone will benefit from the contents. I think a lot of stories were left out. This easily read book shows Gerstner would make a good journalist.<br /><br />Gerstner's first and basic decision was to reduce the cost to mainframe customers. They used CMOS transistors (like in home computers) for a lower cost, and IBM renewed its emphasis on customers. This reversed the decline in mainframes and saved the company. The loss of billions required drastic cuts, not just in a bloated administration, but in surplus productive employees. Expenses would have to drop faster than the decline in gross profits (p.63). Page 59 says \\"competitors in the computer industry, unlike any other industry I know, try to create unique standards that they own\\". This is the result of Anti-Trust Laws that allow you to put a generic tire on a Chevy or Ford. Page 64 tells of the fiefdoms of multiple accounting systems, and the need to update and simplify them. Didn't General Motors go thru this same trial around 1982? Page 66 tells of the sale of \\"unproductive assets\\". Page 72 mentions the interaction between ability and morale or reputation.<br /><br />Gerstner's proudest accomplishment is that his successor and the heads of all major business units are longtime IBM veterans. This happens when a company brings in outside consultants to do what is needed, and then leave.<br />Page 257 mentions the \\"wild pronouncements\\" like \\"the paperless office\\" (people want tangibles, and read in many places), or \\"dot-com universe\\" (people want social interaction). Did these originate as customer demands? Chapter 28 underlines the problem of a corporation. High-level managers who get rich through fraud or embezzlement is not new; read the history books for similar events from the 1870s to 1930s. Today's dot-coms are like yesteryear's railroads. Was the media flaunting the \\"new economy\\" a few years ago? Doesn't the business side of the media always control the editorial side? Gerstner mentions the role of \\"investment bankers\\" (p.260); they have been the most powerful members of our ruling class since the 18th century. Pages 261-3 list some common sense cures. A company controlled by its owners is better than a corporation run by hirelings. Page 271 explains the difference between \\"cash flow\\" and \\"revenue\\".<br /><br />Chapter 30 asks about the corporation and the community. Before the 1860s no corporation could be chartered unless it served a public purpose (canals, waterworks, railroads). Corporate contributions may be a vestige of this tradition. Preventing companies from incorporating unless they served a public purpose would answer this question.	2003-01-23

Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets	Books	5	4	9	N	N	Hoover's Hidden History	The first sixty pages tell of the three days after Hoover's death. AAG Patrick Gray asked AD John Mohr for \\"the secret files\\" only to be told there were no secret files (p.37). They used code words to hide them, such as \\"Official Confidential\\" and \\"Do Not File\\" files! Page 73 mentions that Hoover was \\"in charge of counter-radical activities as special assistant to the attorney general\\" since 1917. Hoover was a strong proponent of \\"dragnet\\" raids, made without warrants and probable cause (pp. 72-3). While this is usually censored in the history books, some WW II era movies show Nazis doing this in occupied countries. Page 77 tells how a prediction of insurrection and terrorism resulted in an increased budget!     Hoover was appointed chief of the General Intelligence Division in 1919 (p.79). One-third to one-half of special agents investigated threatened strikes; the DOJ became a national strikebreaking agency! Since 1914 the cost of living had doubled, and wages declined by 14%. Their penetration and control of the two Communist parties allowed them to arrange meetings so their members could be easily arrested (p.91)! The affidavits of probable cause were almost devoid of proof (p.89). (I wonder if this could ever happen again?) Page 93 tells how the BI's undercover agents handed out red membership cards to often illiterate aliens. After warrantless arrests, the \\"third degree\\" was used to get their statements. Since no Revolution occurred afterwards, the 'NY Times\\" claimed a success! Months later the National Popular Government League released its study, and said the Department of Justice was breaking the laws and violating the Constitution (p.98). The twelve signers were famous lawyers. Hoover immediately opened a file on each! Other lawyers condemned these raids, including two future Supreme Court Justices.     Page 101 explains how this \\"Double Cross System\\" worked: \\"beyond reasonable doubt, the Government owns and operates some part of the Communist Party\\". Thissuspected agent had helped write two key documents used in all of these cases. During WW II some in British Intellignce criticized Hoover's arrest of the 8 Nazi spies, saying they should have doubled them. But they didn't understand American politics! They may have looked down on the Americans, but Hoover (and others) were running agents while these critics were still in diapers.     Hoover showed his talents by being kept on with a new administration. He investigated Harding's political opponents, and easily switched loyalties (p.109). Hoover received support from military intelligence (p.11). Page 114 tells how investigating Mann Act violations created massive amounts of data on corruption. Some prominent names (Rockefeller, Mellon, and Vanderbilt) profited from prostitution as landlords. Page 120 tells of a proposal to create sympathy for the Attorney General by bombing his house!     And there are many more such stories in later chapters. Remember this: J Edgar Hoover was promoted because he was the best man available in the \\"Department of Easy Virtue\\"!	2003-01-13

What about 'Father Knows Best', or 'Mayberry RFD', or 'All in the Family'? Weren't they all hit shows in their day? Is 'The Sopranos' a modern dress version of 'I, Claudius'? Would the plots be usable for 'At Home with Cesare Borgia'? Can a work of fiction ever be a measure of society? Perhaps its popularity is due to its dealing with usually unreported facts (like 'The Untouchables'). Or the fantasy of a strong and powerful man who can do as he pleases (think of James Bond or a John Wayne film).<br />I wonder how reliable are its statements? Page 9 claims the murder rate of America is \\"ten times higher than Europe, Canada, and Japan combined\\". But the rate of violent deaths in America is less than in many European countries or Japan, and just above Canada's! Page 11 claims poverty was not a social problem before JFK! That would be news to FDR or Truman. Simon uses his sociological imagination to analyze this show as a case study. This would be a better book if it was based on a real \\"Middletown\\" rather than a fantasy TV drama. <br />Page 14 talks about the pursuit of financial success as if this was strange, but De Tocqueville said the same thing around 1835. Did they have today's problems then? Simon then says America is \\"anti-intellectual\\" because success involves making money, not education! But what about Europe and its history? Is there much difference? Page 16 talks about putting businessmen into government. Was it different under King James II, Louis XIV, or the Caesars? Page 157 says people can \\"keep only $1 in every $2 they earn over $5000\\"; he needs to do better research.<br />Chapter 6 compares crime in America to a department store of many levels, from the bottom to the top. Street gangs, organized crime, white-collar crime, banks and major corporations, the criminal justice system, and, crime in Government Intelligence Agencies. I found this the most interesting section of the book. Are wedoomed? Chapter 8 contrasts the realities of everyday life to what we learned in Civics Class. Simon claims a bewildered and disillusioned public react with skepticism and cynicism. And this keeps people from acting to correct their problems.<br />Chapter 9 proposes solutions to the many problems of today's America. Simon correctly states that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without collective action. I think the same history tells us that his solution is worthless (\\"join a local church ... oppose environmental destruction ...\\"). If the problems are caused by the corporate control of politicians since the 1860s, then the solution is to rebuild democracy by eliminating corporate power on the state and national level. Other books have made this point (\\"Wealth and Democracy\\" by Kevin Phillips). You must start with a new political party that is NOT controlled by the \\"two party system\\". It won't be easy. Corporate power, like hell, is not easily conquered.	2002-12-31

Every scrap of testimony by the prosecution was perjured! The verdict caused worldwide protest demonstrations. Both men were freed after twenty years in prison.   Preparedness Day parades that year were business sponsored, pro-Republican party, anti-Wilson, and anti-labor. It could mean the European War, the Invasion of Mexico, or an attack on Democrats, Progressives, organized Labor, Socialists, pacifists, or supporters of President Wilson (p.12). The parade went on with unaccustomed silence from the crowd. At 2:06PM the bomb went off, killing 10 people and wounding may others; over forty were hospitalized. Glass from broken windows fell on the people below. When DA Fickert arrived, he used a sledge hammer and crowbar to create more damage! Photographs on page 28. Five people were arrested for this crime, when there were no warrants and no evidence to connect them to it.   Thomas Jeremiah Mooney's father was a coal miner and union organizer. His early death left the family poor, and they moved to Massachusetts where they had relatives. Tom became involved in union activities (p.34). The Panic of 1907 saw him travelling to find work across the country. He found work in Stockton, and joined the Socialist Party. Salesman Mooney went out to sell pamphlets rather than wait for customers to call. Tom became a militant organizer for industrial unionism. He then joined the IWW and its &#34;direct action&#34;. Tom often criticized the union leaders as much as corporate employers; he made enemies of those who should be allies.   The early life of Warren Knox Billings saw him moving from job to job. One of his jobs was at a struck factory, where he sabotaged the work (p.54). He then became part of the Mooney family. Page 60 explains how the frame-up racket worked. Tom seems to have had too much arrogance and pride. Page 66 tells how the president of United Railroad looted the company of millions, not unlike today's scandals. Tom tried to organize a union there but failed. Page 70 tells of another attempted frame-up: they hired a look-alike to carry suitcases to where bombs would be set off!   This book is important as it documents prosecutorial tricks repeated at other political trials. Single, double, and triple agents do not occur only in wartime! Part One is their personal history. Part Two is about the trial. Part Three is about the efforts to free them. Part Four tells of their release. The appendix discusses the solutions to the crime. Henry Landau's &#34;The Enemy Within&#34; tells of German espionage in America during that time. His &#34;Secrets of The White Lady&#34; tells of his intelligence work in occupied Belgium and France.	2002-12-26

The more civilized mankind became, the more sophisticated the weapons. There are two kinds of weapons, for either offensive or defensive use. The first would be a club or a rifle; either will strike from a distance with more power than a bare arm. The second would be a shield or a fort. The book provides a quick tour of history, not a detailed one. Every weapon created in the past has eventually been nullified by some countermeasure; until the atomic age. The prospect of a nuclear winter seems to have neutralized them as much as their possession by other countries. Cold kills as well as radiation.<br />Stone weapons began before recorded history. Stone arrowheads and lance heads were used up to 8th century AD. Axes and knives are used more as tools, arrows and spears for hunting. Bronze was first used around 3000BC in what is now called Iraq. These Chaldeans also invented war chariots. Walls protected the cities; this allows a smaller force to defend against a larger force. Around 680BC the Greeks began to use iron for swords and spears. They also invented the siege weapons used up to Renaissance times. The Romans adapted walls as an offensive weapon to trap a walled town until food ran out. The Dark Ages are notable for the invention of feudalism, a form of government that continues to this day in the world of politics. Bows were still used for hunting, spears and swords for war. The invention of knights mounted on cavalry made foot soldiers obsolete.<br />The Bayeux Tapestry shows the use of archers in warfare. The Normans' military system modified the feudal system. Heroism in battle could be valued more than social position or wealth. The purpose of a water-filled moat was to drown out any attempt of undermining the walls.<br />The battle of Crecy, and the defeat of mounted knights by peasant longbow-men, marked the end of the long dominance of cavalry. England encouraged archery among the common people. A qualified archer could shoot a dozen arrows in one minute at a man-size target 240 yards distant - and hit it every time (p.62). The threat of archery was met by plated armor instead of chain mail. Free Companies helped end chivalry, along with gunpowder. Edged weapons were mostly ended by gunpowder by the 19th century; and flintlocks by percussion firing. Percussion caps made pistols more popular. The pepperbox lead to the revolver that Colt perfected. Metallic cartridges were invented by 1860.<br />Page 118 wonders about a single-shot pistol after the Civil War; durability and reliability from simplicity? Page 119 mentions the adoption of the Springfield in 1873 rather than a repeating rifle; the previous reasons, and to use a bayonet? Smokeless powder made repeating rifles practical. The rest of the book deals with the 20th century.	2002-12-22

The effects of concentrated wealth are: high levels of political corruption, arrogant global economic power, a twisted tax code, and the capture of government by private interests. The wealthy have been supported by religious voters because of the preachings of church leaders; the reason for the rich to control the colleges and universities. They have then reduced median family income, stagnated or reduced wages, reduced government services, and attacked the sense of community (p.xiv). Economic inequality leads to political inequality; so noted in Aristotle's 'Politics'.<br /><br />Phillips compares the world power of today's America to yesterday's Britain, Holland, and Habsburg Spain at their zenith. He says the 'war against terrorism' will attack our democratic principles, and blame terrorism rather than economic policy for hard times! The increase in wealth among the top 5% followed the impoverization of the rest of America. The Federal Reserve Board and the US Treasury act to benefit the wealthy few. Technology works to favor the capitalist owners at the expense of the working masses. Phillips then projects current trends.<br /><br />The six major waves of inflation that hit America resulted from wars, and the increased supply of money. But huge fortunes were made in early America from government contracts. Corruption in Civil War supplies doubled the national debt (this means every one is taxed to pay the wealthy few). Great wealth flowed from closeness to Government. Or why millions are spent in campaign contributions to win a seat in Congress?<br /><br />Since FDR, unionization and employee prosperity rose together; since Reagan it has fallen. The portion of the nation's wealth held by the top 1% nearly doubled (p.92), the lower quintiles lost out. Page 104 compares the mercantilism of old to US policies of the 1980s and 1990s; they produced bonds and stocks rather than goods and services. Wage earners have the least: vacation time, maternity leaves, notice of termination; they have the highest death rates from hypertension (p.113). While the EIC and minimum wage increase helped, the jump in FICA lowered after-tax income for the lower brackets (p.132), as did dwindling employee benefits and health coverage (p.133). Federal taxes were reduced for corporations and raised for employees (p.149). Page 162 notes that after 1945 unionized production line workers lived better than European bank managers. After 1990 Americans worked the longest hours in the industrialized world, elsewhere wages rose while working hours shortened. Page 164 explains why the US unemployment rate is higher than reported.<br /><br />Chapter 4 tells how in Hapsburg Spain, the Netherlands, and Great Britain general decline was matched by increased wealth for the few. The reliance on global finance and services rather than commerce and production was the twilight stage of a great economic power (p.172). Those who warned against this development were both correct and spurned by their Ruling Class; Kevin Phillips will be no different.<br /><br />Pages 221-2 explains the scam of the 1986 \\"Tax Reform Act\\". It now taxed Social Security Benefits, raised the lowest rates, and lowered the highest rates. FICA rates were raised higher than income taxes for two-earner families. 19th century Presidents rejected central banks tied to special interests; the best economic growth in America occurred with independent subtreasury units. The private banking cartel \\"Federal Reserve Bank\\" helped to bring about the Great Depression.<br /><br />[This is from the hardcover edition.]	2002-12-21

We could no longer assume that \\"government would not lie, that law enforcement agencies would not fabricate evidence\\" (p.548). Hiss was re-admitted to the Massachusetts bar. This book seems to have been written to convict Hiss yet again.     The statements about W Chambers lead me to believe he was a psychopathic personality that any normal person would avoid. The clue was the many stories he told that are self-serving. One person said Chambers claimed Francis B Sayre was part of a Communist underground (p.337); Chambers denied this. But if you ever meet someone who tells you stories about knowing things, to impress you, its a good chance he is a con man trying to sell you something.     Hiss would not have been convicted without the documents produced by Chambers. The differences in character are so vast that Chambers can't be credible. One unexplained weakness on the part of the Hisses was their friendship with the Crosleys. Could they have been so trusting as to sublet an apartment, loan a car, etc? Yes, if they were taken in by this schemer. Page 360 says \\"most of Hiss's associates and superiors ... found no evidence of disloyalty\\". Is the lack of evidence proof of guilt? The State Dept is the preserve of the rich and well-connected. It is unusual for someone without wealth and family to rise so high, given the rivalry and jealousy, unless Hiss had a powerful patron. As in business, a change in regime meant his star started to fall.     Why is Hiss innocent? Page 357 tells of \\"technical surveillance\\": phone taps, mail cover, physical surveillance, tracking daily movements. No crime was found then. Pages 153-5 tell of the AAA purge. Was Hiss used to investigate a clique that modified the law regarding sharecroppers? Was he then moved up to another agency as his reward? Don't these things happen in corporations and government?     Was Chambers sent back to the Communist Party in 1929 as a double agent? Page 314 \\"... I have had to re-examine my position as of 1929.\\" That could explain his break in 1937, the year of the purges. Chambers tells of hiding copies of documents as a \\"life preserver\\", but I don't see how a hidden paper would help if he wasn't around to corroborate it. I once read that 30% of Communist Party officials and 10% of the membership were FBI informers. How far back did this penetration go?     Page 449 quotes Alger Hiss denying giving any \\"unauthorized\\" documents. Did anyone ask if he gave authorized documents?  Page 557 says it is impossible to \\"exactly\\" duplicate the characteristics of one typewriter by manufacturing another one. But if you can get 99% accuracy, that may be good enough for government work. I once read that an expert could see differences between the Hiss standard, the Tytell machine, and the microfilmed documents. This would indicate there was \\"forgery by typewriter\\", and these differences should stand objective comparison.	2002-12-20

The summer saw Confederate successes, and the invasion of Maryland in September. The Union victory drove back the Confederates, prevented foreign recognition of the Confederacy, raised the morale of the Union, and allowed Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. More American soldiers died in this one battle than in all other 19th century wars combined! Such slaughter would not be seen again until the Great War.<br />The small rivers in Virginia were a defense line to any advance onto Richmond. McClellan wanted a flank attack from Fort Monroe, using a secure supply line. McClellan moved too slowly, the Confederate army escaped, but Norfolk was captured. The Union army was a few miles from Richmond, and the war seemed likely to end. <br />While the Union Navy could not prevent cotton exports in 1861, the South decided not to export cotton to pressure Great Britain to recognize the Confederacy! The bumper crops of 1859 and 1860 created a surplus and negated this strategy. By 1862 the Union Navy effected the blockade, and this reduced any chance of European recognition. (There is no mention of Union wheat exports.)<br />May 1862 saw TJ Jackson's victory in the Shenandoah valley. J Johnston's attack on McClellan's army resulted in his replacement by Robert E Lee. The book mentions McClellan's reluctance to attack, and Confederate successes. This implies that McClellan's intelligence was faulty, and the Confederates much better. McClellan remained popular with his troops; did they see the big picture? Some army officers thought McClellan should have attacked. Part of this criticism stems from the politics of cliques and rivalries, not just the failure to win or even attack.<br />While the Confederacy was founded to keep slavery, their European sympathizers were against slavery (p.60). Since the Union did not then call for abolition, they also lost support. Lincoln was a pragmatic politician. If keeping slavery saved the Union, he would do it. But if saving the Union meant destroying slavery, he would do that. Lincoln was &quot;naturally anti-slavery&quot;, and the South knew it. In July Lincoln told border-state congressmen that if they did not accept compensated emancipation, universal emancipation would follow &quot;a military necessity&quot; )p.70). Public opinion changed since 1861.<br />The Confederate invasion of Maryland was not followed by popular support. Defeat of the Union could turn America into petty republics, as in South America. But the Confederate supply lines were lengthened, and the Union army became more strengthened (p.104). On Sept 13, 1862 Corporal Barton W. Mitchell found an envelope with three cigars. In there was &quot;Special Orders No 191&quot; which told of Lee's plans. This was brought to McCLellan; for once he had the advantage! But Little Mac delayed, and Lee escaped disaster. McClellan failed to use his cavalry to scout the enemy. After Lee withdrew his troops, McClellan, with more fresh troops, failed to pursue (p.130). McClellan did stop Lee's invasion, but did not beat or destroy Lee's army. Lee would not take the offensive for eight months.<br />The Union continued to grow in strength after Antietam. This was the end of the beginning. The battles at Vicksburg and Gettysburg next year marked the beginning of the end. This book gives a concise history of that time.	2002-12-19

In 1962 Nixon's \\"Six Crises\\" boasted they \\"built a typewriter\\" for the Hiss case; the book was quickly revised. I later read \\"Room 3603\\" which told how a forged typewritten document was used to win a franchise for a British airline in 1939; I understood what this meant. Since \\"Room 3603\\" was reprinted in 1978, and again in 2000, Weinstein can look it up.  The typewritten documents were decisive in convicting Hiss (p.569). So if they were forged, Hiss would be not guilty. The Appendix discusses this topic, but does not mention the 1952 TRUE magazine article of Martin Tytell, or his work for the OSS. Weinstein claims the recreated typewriter had dissimilar characters, but this only showed up under high power magnification, not the 4X used at the trial. Tytell only worked part time, and had to search for samples of type to modify for the desired results. Once he learned how to do it, and had a budget for experienced engravers, it could be done more quickly.     Page 572 mentions \\"microfilm\\" but doesn't explain its purpose: it doesn't show any fingerprints, and the paper can't be analyzed. Page 575 mentions the examiners who turned down the offer of investigating forgery by typewriter. Weinstein doesn't mention that this was a very politically controversial case, and would challenge their accepted beliefs. I don't assume Chambers could have forged a document. But as an agent for an intelligence service other assets would be available to do this. Page 578 mentions the collection of \\"hundreds of Woodstocks\\" but doesn't explain why. Page 579 tells about faking letters to ruin people's careers. Can't Weinstein connect the dots?     I always wondered why Henry Luce would have hired a secret Communist as a TIME magazine editor. But if Chambers was really a double agent during the 1930s, his credentials would pass this test. It was only after the complaints of readers that Luce was forced to fire Chambers. Hecould not explain Chamber's background without giving away the secret. Anymore than Hiss could tell that his friends in the 1930s were the Fields, not the Crosleys; read \\"Operation Splinter Factor\\" on this.     The book has a number of photographs, but lacks the long suppressed 1935 photo of Chambers. This shows him sandy haired, mustached, and around 145 pounds; his mouth is closed. Compare this to the 1948 photo showing him gray haired and balding, around 300 pounds, and with corrective dental work. Do they look similar? If people you knew a dozen years ago change in appearance, do you always recognize them under a new name?     One reason why I believe Hiss to be not guilty is that he continued to live in NY, and did not flee like Kim Philby or other real Soviet agents. Hiss lived long enough to see Chambers dead and Nixon disgraced, but not long enough to be rehabilitated. You are well advised to always tear up handwritten memos before throwing them in the trash so they can't be used against you. And if you have the chance to become a triple agent, consider that future management may disavow all knowledge and responsibility for your actions.	2002-12-07

This book is the result of twenty years of experience in troubleshooting hardware and software products. Agans documented his nine rules for debugging, and explains each one in a chapter. You can read this to get ideas for solving problems in a systematic way.     His first rule is \\"understand the system\\", another way to say \\"don't assume\\" or \\"read the manual\\". [His comments on \\"a politician\\" tells me he should follow rule #1 (p.18).] Sometimes the constraints of time and money will not let you capture enough information; management will set the rules and schedules.  The \\"quit thinking and look\\" rule says that facts should drive theories (like in criminal detection). Making a list of probable causes can be a guide to research. Page 54 tells of a bug in \\"one small, simple software routine\\". Is code inspection passe? Page 65 tells of a light not going on. Based on MTBF, its more likely the light bulb than the switch. But don't overlook the possibility of the connection at the receptacle.     \\"Divide and Conquer\\" would be better phrased as \\"narrowing the search\\" for a faulty component in a planned, logical manner. Changing one thing at a time advises against trial and error, or guessing at the solution. Keeping track of all changes allows narrowing the search, and any possible interaction with an earlier change.     \\"Check the Plug\\" suggests using a PRINT statement that works all the time, not just for a certain event. This is not practical advice in my experience! You should test the tool before using it for testing; re-calibration is always good. \\"Get a Fresh View\\" is another way to restate the problem. When doing this you may suddenly realize what you've overlooked. Often someone has come across the same or similar problem. It can also be good politics to delegate responsibility.     Page 125 describes the classic \\"dirty gas filter\\" syndrome. Consider getting the gas lines blown out. A locking gas cap is one way to prevent this; don't overlook sabotage as a cause. \\"In the old system we knew how to crash it so they'd send us out on break.\\" Chapter 11 recommends testing a fix by removing it to prove the change. This rules out any random differences; except when its obvious (p.128). Some problems do go away by itself. I once worked on a serially-reusable on-line program. After I made it re-entrant (so it didn't modify the code) a lot of strange bugs just disappeared.     Chapter 13 gives a number of examples using the rules. The touchpad problem could have been avoided with either code inspection or programming standards. Or a better compiler? Chapter 14 tells how the rules apply to a Help Desk. The last chapter suggests how to use this book at work or in school. But if your job resembles Dilbert's, bring your resume up to date (the tenth rule?).	2002-12-04

The main point is to eat \\"real foods\\" and avoid \\"faux foods\\", and how to tell the difference. He spent two years as a Research Fellow in Lyon France. He ate as much as he wanted, and lost weight (p.7). The author is a historian at University of Pittsburgh. The book has a list for further research. The beginning says the book is intended to be an enjoyable informational and educational supplement, not medical advice.<br />There is a fashion in foods. One year we're told butter and eggs (the traditional defense against tuberculosis) are bad for you; years later we are told just the opposite. The life insurance weight table from 1940 only reflects the Great Depression, the worst catastrophe in the twentieth century. What was the life expectancy then?<br />\\"There are no fat people in France. If you find any, they speak English\\" (p.15). Perhaps an oversimplification? Eating a French diet (bread, butter, creamy cheese, etc.) caused a loss of weight or volume. The average French life span is longer (p.17), even though they \\"smoke like fiends\\". Bad fat comes from red animal meats (or the ingested chemicals?) not from milk (always considered \\"good for you\\"). Higher consumption of animal fat correlates to higher heart disease (p.21). A fat deprived diet lowers the metabolic rate; the body burns up fewer calories. Then the body conserves fat (p.24). Those who eat poorly, and too much, gain weight. You have to eat right, take vitamins, and walk more. You cannot lose weight sitting by the television. Page 27 notes the result of eating bread and pastries, cheese, butter, cream, and whole mile products. Don't snack between meals, get outside and walk around; take time when eating.

Keep this in mind as you read this book. On page 4 he claims \\"an astounding high level of personal violence separates the U.S. from every other industrial nation\\", but he gives no proof for his claim. It seems like the \\"argument from ignorance\\" logical fallacy. More violence than in Brazil, Argentina, or Mexico? They all had similar historical development in this hemisphere. Or is he talking about western Europe, where Social Democratic policies have long be in use? On page 5 he argues that guns only became common in the mid nineteenth century, and were concentrated in urban areas! Could it be that people own guns, and people were concentrated in urban areas? He also claims the U.S. government worked to arm its citizens, but gives no proof on this page.     On page 6 he claims \\"car magazines ... often publish articles highly critical of the automotive industry\\" but can give no proof. When I read these magazines I saw they lavishly praised the products advertised in their pages. Do they condemn products NOT advertised? Don't the other hobby magazines operate the same way? On page 7 he mentions the \\"view that citizens have a constitutionally protected right to own machine guns\\". But don't the citizens of Sweden and Switzerland have that right, even without a Second Amendment? Perhaps it has something to do with being peaceful and neutral?     On page 12 he seems to use the lack of records for proof that there was no \\"American gun culture\\". (But who invented this phrase?) Some of the reviews say his research can not be duplicated, and he destroyed or discarded his notes. Was that a responsible scholarly act? On page 13 he says he examined more than a thousand probate records fromnorthern New England and western Pennsylvania. The vagueness of these locations makes it difficult to check his research. On page 14 he claims there was no \\"well armed public\\" before 1850! Did Patrick Henry or Eldridge Gerry say so? Were people nude and barefoot because there were no mention of clothes and shoes? Where are those records? In the early 19th century firearms were in a revolutionary state, changing from flintlocks to cap and ball, from cartridges to repeating rifles. Any firearm owned decades earlier would become obsolete and not worthy of inheritance. What is the rule today?     On page 15 he talks about deer hunters in New York. He compares the PERCENTAGE of muzzle loader hunters to the NUMBERS of deer culled by archers! He ignores the length and timing of these seasons; would a truth seeking scholar do this? He doesn't say if the archers later went hunting with guns. On pages 20 22 he tells of the need to keep firearms from the hands of the common people. And THAT is today's motive for \\"gun control\\"   you can't oppress a well armed people either in Aristotle's time or today. And you don't have to ban a product if people don't want it.  Reading the rest of the book is left as an exercise to the student. Will it be like the first pages?	2002-12-02

In the Prologue Fuhrman says the mistakes he made will forever haunt him (p.xxi). Any apology would be inadequate.   Fuhrman plead no contest to the perjury charge, and thinks he got a raw deal (p.252). &#34;I should never have been asked the questions that led to my perjury conviction&#34; (p.6). This plea deal was as lenient as the law allows (p.7). The Los Angeles Police Protective League would not help, even though they financed the defense of accused murderers, rapists, child molesters, and drug addicts! Fuhrman complains that &#34;policemen never get the benefit of the doubt&#34; (p.9). After his plea he decided to write a book to tell his story: he did a good job, he did nothing wrong, but was blamed when the case fell apart (p.9). So what did he do to deserve all this? Fuhrman alone found the blood on the Bronco; he alone found the bloody glove (p.32). Yet he did not discover the blood on the inside of the Bronco (p.35)! He blames the lead detectives for the mistakes that would compromise the case (p.45). Page 48 mentions the brown leather glove found at the crime scene, but the picture shows a black leather glove was found at the Simpson estate! On pages 52-54 Fuhrman tells of a bloody fingerprint seen on the back gate. Was it erased because it was not Simpson's, and would weaken the case against him?   Pages 60-76 tell how interrogations are done; you won't see this on TV. Fuhrman again criticizes Vannatter and Lange for their actions, but also said decisions came from &#34;higher up&#34; (p.78). Page 105 gives Fuhrman's comments on the alleged glove planting. &#34;There was not a shred of evidence that I could have done anything like planting the glove. In fact, it could be proved there was no way I could have done so.&#34; You can read Stephen Singular's &#34;Legacy of Deception&#34; for another viewpoint: &#34;all the blood evidence is suspect&#34;. In Chapter 11 Fuhrman gives the allegations, and his facts in denial. Chapter 12 tells of his &#34;professional conflicts&#34; with Judge Ito's wife. Was it now payback time?   Chapter 13 discusses the evidence. Fuhrman uses words like &#34;a match with&#34; and &#34;consistent with&#34;. The book &#34;Tainting Evidence&#34; explains why these phrases are misleading. Fuhrman says &#34;the blue-black cotton fibers are no doubt from the clothes that Simpson wore&#34;. &#34;No doubt&#34;? Can anyone believe that OJ hid the bloody clothes and shoes so they would never be found, but brought the socks and one glove back to his home? Since the forensic evidence said the murders occurred after 11PM, OJ could not have committed these murders. Fuhrman's book is well written. The LAPD's loss is the literary world's gain. Marcia Clark's career also ended, and Lange and Vannatter then retired. No one says why.	2002-11-26
1333159:US	38002140	R357LTAB5D4KU3	0345297431	693709908	Double-Cross System	Books	5	5	8	N	N	The Grand Deception of World War II	This 1972 book explains how the British Secret Service actively ran and controlled Germany's spies during WW II. All German agents who were sent to Great Britain were captured; they either worked for the British Secret Service or were executed. This activity involved the cooperation of many branches of government (p.viii). This cooperation was the one essential condition for success. The examples given by this book could be a manual of operations. Page xii gives the purposes of the Twenty Committee. Other books were written before, but this is the best document on the system. This book was published to offset the bad publicity suffered in the fifties and sixties (p.xvi).<br />Page 49 says the German spies dropped by parachute were \\"an easy prey\\", and could not make radio contact \\"because of defects in the instruments themselves\\". I think this implies the British had a mole in the Abwehr who cleverly sabotaged their radios.<br />One of the reasons for this system was \\"to get evidence of enemy plans and intentions from the questions asked by them\\" (p.58). Chapter 5 gives many examples, such as the American Questionnaire which asked detailed questions about Hawaii and Pearl Harbor in August 1941 (p.80). Page 85 tells of Plan Midas, a successful money laundering operation where Nazi money paid for British counter-espionage! Chapter 8 notes that sending information back to Germany via double agents meant that the enemy would not send in other agents (p.108).<br />Deception was best assured by preventing dangerous information from being passed on, not by passing misinformation (p.110). They passed on facts which lead the enemy to deduce false intentions. Page 116 tells of the German agent who stayed in Lisbon and created stories of his visits to England. \\"Since he always reported what the the Germans expected to hear, and since many of his guesses were startlingly near to the truth, he was more and more readily believed.\\" In April 1942 agent TRICYCLE was to report on American research into the atomic bomb (p.176). 1942 marked a change: Germany now sought information on British offensives, not defenses. In 1943 the policy of the XX Committee was to reduce the forces on the Russian front. Page 138 tells of METEOR, the German triple agent. By 1944 the sole interest was the grand deception for the Normandy invasion. To make the date of attack appear later, to indicate the wrong location of the attack, and to suggest the attack was just a feint. The reports on the V-1 flying bomb were used to make them fall short of the target (p.179).<br />Why did the Germans fail and the British succeed? He says it was the personal integrity of the British. German blunders were due to Abwehr officials profiting from their agent, and could not honestly judge the agent's work. Another is the fact that espionage in wartime is difficult and usually unprofitable; counterespionage is comparatively easy and yields satisfactory results (pp.187-190). Since espionage and counterespionage deal with different sides of the same problems, they should be as united as possible. At least activities should be on records accessible to each other. (This book necessarily lacks all mention of British spying in Germany.)	2002-11-20

(Was he the last General to lead his troops into battle, and die?) In his 36 years he lived in very interesting times. He wanted fame and glory, and bought it on a Sunday afternoon. \\"Custer has been the subject of more books and articles than any American except Abraham Lincoln\\" (p.9). He was also controversial. This book covers both the Civil War and the postwar years, and is based upon recent scholarship and research. The Bibliography has seven pages of unpublished sources and twenty pages of published sources.<br />The Civil War meant an early graduation from West Point, and Custer was sent to the Second Cavalry and Bull Run. Brevet Captain Custer was promoted to Brigadier General in 1863. He was one of the youngest Union Generals in the Civil War.  He adopted a brilliant crimson necktie that was copied by his troops (the 'red badge of courage'?). Custer and his 7th Michigan defeated JEB Stuart's Invincibles to help win the battle of Gettysburg. Custer gained the confidence and admiration of the entire brigade (p.101). There was no question of his bravery, leadership qualities, or skill in combat (p.102). <br />Thousands of square miles of land were given to the railroads. They would profit when white settlers bought this land, grew crops, and used the railroads for transportation. The Army was used to pacify the Indians on the Great Plains, and ethnically cleanse these lands. The Indians fought back in many battles, but lost. Peace treaties were made to place tribes on reservations. Forts were built to protect settlers and towns. Cavalry was used on these vast plains, but were limited by their wagon trains. The army's job was to keep the Indians on the reservation. <br />In 1873 the Northern Pacific sought military protection for its planned railroad thru Montana and Wyoming. On August 4, 1873 Custer and about 90 troops scouted the Yellowstone. They were attacked by 300 Sioux. The troops retreated to the cottonwood trees and held them off. When their ammunition ran low, Custer mounted a counterattack and the Sioux fled. The cavalry with discipline, fire-power (Spencer rifles), and leadership could oppose a larger force of warriors. Three years later Custer's luck ran out. The last chapters tell all about Custer's Last Stand.	2002-11-14

Sometimes, if you know something about the topic, you'll realize it is a one-sided presentation. But this applies to other shows on TV; or the radio.<br />The author investigated the \\"60 Minutes\\" investigators to discover why it is so successful. The answer is: they tell good stories! They identify a problem, explain it, and provide a simple solution. They provide the facts, and let you decide. Do the facts presented lead to the conclusion desired by the producers? With the given time constraints, they can only do so much.<br />The technique is to use a single camera, and record for many hours. After the answers, the newsperson is recorded asking questions (which may be phrased to fit the answers). Then the editing begins. With many hours of statements, they get to choose what they want. The end result is a story whose conclusion follows from the edited statements. They never show \\"out-takes\\"; page 186 explains \\"cutaways\\".<br />Chapter 4 tells how they get the story. It should be read for its inherent practical advice. The producers flatter the subject to gain their confidence. \\"TV news is show business, but uses show business techniques to convey information rather than to distort it\\" (p.54). \\"Drama is but life with the dull bits cut out\\" (p.60). Page 129 gives an example of editing; a twenty-page interview became two-pages on -air. \\"60 Minutes\\" provides multiples of the old 15-minute news, a variety that fills up the hour, and attracts more viewers than with a single subject, and avoids boredom.<br />Chapter 11 tells of the cases where they freed innocent people from jail. Pages 151-2 tell of a particularly corrupt case. A schoolteacher runs for city council, and is then arrested, tried, and convicted for a kidnapping that never happened! Paroled after eight months into a thirty-year sentence, as a convicted felon he could never again run for public office! Could this have happened in any other state?<br />Chapter 13 discusses the editing that goes into creating the finished story. Page 188 explains how they juggle questions and answers; network news forbids separating questions from answers. This cannot be done with live interviews. Page 190 gives another example on how this trick is done.	2002-11-09

The author was a Hearst reporter and columnist for many decades. It contains no pictures of the many people mentioned in the book, and no index. Yet it is worth reading for education as well as entertainment. Earl Rogers was the real person who was the model for the fictional “Perry Mason”. (ER also had a young lawyer on his staff named Paul Drake.) Other books tell of Earl Rogers’ contributions to law and justice. Earl Rogers could have been on the Supreme Court.   Earl Rogers had a number of firsts: the introduction of ballistic evidence, the use of scale models, charts, and blackboards in the courtroom, etc. His advertised motto was: “Call us and keep your mouth shut”, as true today as a century ago. He participated in many famous trials, and would win because of detailed study of the facts and testimony, and sometimes by finding overlooked witnesses and evidence. Unfortunately, his drinking limited and put an early end to his career (like some other trial lawyers).   For another view of Rogers, read “Front-Page Detective” by William R. Hunt.	2002-10-31

It lacks an index and table of contents, but is well written. It takes the technical subject of military camouflage and makes it interesting to the general reader. Magic has been part of warfare since the Trojan Horse. It can explain the Walls of Jericho, and the parting of the Red Sea.    It tells how JM matched tricks with the leader of the Dervishes to get safe passage for British troops. How JM stumbled over the means to get desert camouflage paint. To prevent Alexandria Harbor from being bombed, JM moved it! To avoid an attack, dummy tanks, guns, and troops were created as reinforcements to be seen by enemy air reconnaissance. To protect the Suez Canal he used high-intensity rotating searchlights; this was copied by Britain's air defense.    JM was asked to give lectures on escaping when captured; he became a member of MI9 (which dealt with escape and evasion). His Magic Gang also created dummy submarines to hide the absence of real ones. He traveled to Malta to help hide real airplanes and create dummies to attract and waste bombs. They developed a way to drop a crate of supplies without using scarce parachutes. When his friend survived a plane crash only to die in the fire, JM created a cream that withstood flames for a few minutes to allow people to escape. When testing out in the desert, JM became lost an nearly died from dehydration.    To prepare for the attack from the Alamein Line Gen. Montgomery wanted his forces on the north hidden so the enemy would expect an attack in the south. Since the desert was flat, the camofleurs had an impossible job of deception and misdirection: to put a decoy army in the south and hide a real army in the north. Thousands of tons of supplies had to be hidden in the north while dummy supplies had to be hidden in the south. Pages 278-9 explains how the dummy water pipeline was built. The Battle ofEl Alamein began as planned. The Magic Gang created a phony sea invasion twenty miles behind enemy lines, which diverted German reserve forces. Chapter 18 tells how German tanks were halted by dummy cardboard tanks and silver painted boards! And the battle ended with Rommell's retreat.    Afterwards JM was sent to Canada to establish Station M, which educated and served the OSS and FBI (\\"Room 3603\\" references this). The Gestapo placed him on their \\"Black List\\". He invented air to ground communication using infrared waves. After the war he migrated to Kenya, and died there.  [During WW II I heard about re-positioning a blinking signal!]	2002-10-30

Books	4	4	5	N	N	The Legend of the Hall-Mills Case	Fatal Tryst : Who Killed the Minister and the Choir Singer?<br /><br />This newer compilation was written after everyone involved had died. It lacks an index to its many photographs, and complements Kunstler’s book. Page 71 mentions the curious phone call from Eleanor; doesn’t it sound like a coded message? The photo on the cover lacks the letters. Chapter 12 ridicules the “Pig Woman”; is this just class bias? He says “her story changed”; but is this unusual? I believe her story to be true since it dovetails with other known facts. Gerald Tomlinson says her story was made up because of the “Oh Henry” cry; yet this just happened to be her brother’s name! (Or was it a euphemism for “Oh Hell”?) You can test if a khaki coat (or pants) looks gray in the moonlight.<br /><br />Many times the author questions statements made by the people involved, as reported in the newspapers. Then or now, how reliable are newspaper stories? Page 217 uses the word “katzenjammer”. Think of a cat when it wants to go outside: frantic and nervous. Page 226 tells how fingerprints could be forged in the 1920s. On pages 236 7 Tomlinson commits the folly of trying to analyze someone from a long ago newspaper account; it doesn’t convince me, and seems like a smear of the chief prosecution witness. Why use the comments of Salome Cerenner when there is no corroboration? His description of psychopaths’ “grossly inflated sense of their self worth and importance” sounds like many managers found in the corporate world. Jane Gibson’s story was checked out by the detectives; Kunstler’s book explains this. Does her story sound too good to be true? Is it very different from other eyewitness stories?<br /><br />Chapter 23 shows Tomlinson doing a better job than Kunstler in analyzing Willie’s testimony (p.253), and in the story of the examination of Reverend Hall’s checkbook (p.271). His comments on Simpson (p.300) seems to be just a whitewash of the trial. On page 309 Tomlinson rules out the Stevens as not the type to murder to avenge family honor. Were they from South Carolina where that was more common? On page 313 Tomlinson mentions Jeffrey MacDonald; he needs to read “Fatal Justice” where a wealthy parent may have bought a guilty verdict.<br /><br />Chapter 29 provides “One Man’s Solution” which makes Willie the sole perpetrator. He talks about the failed marriage of the Mills, but says nothing about the Halls; why not? After earlier rejecting Jane Gibson’s story, he adopts it as his solution! His comments as to a blood stained Apperson and Willie’s suit are very good! I believe his solution is wrong because he previously rejected Jan Gibson’s testimony but adopted it for Chapter 29. The straw hat covering Reverend Hall’s face says somebody wanted to keep the crows from pecking at and disfiguring the face; I think this says Mrs. Hall. The throat cutting and excision of the tongue and larynx suggests jealous hatred; I think this says a woman used to cutting up chickens. Some say the 1926 trial was bungled because of the ‘not guilty’ verdict. But it also succeeded in preventing the Stevens from ever being prosecuted! Did wealth overcome justice?	2002-10-30

The author operated as a secret agent in Nazi Germany in the 1930s, then was placed in charge of the Scientific Intelligence Unit. The code breaking operation followed.<br />Their man in Warsaw learned of the Enigma machine from a Polish mechanic, who was then exfiltrated to Paris. He duplicated the machine in wood. Next, a new cypher machine was acquired for study. They were able to break this unbreakable coding machine. He tells how carefully this information was guarded, and used. With radar and Ultra, Britain was able to efficiently use their scarce resources against larger forces. Only a small number of fighters were sent against the bombers and fighters to minimize losses to the RAF. It worked well; but afterwards Dowding was criticized for not using more fighters earlier.<br />Why was the Battle of the Bulge a surprise? They had come to rely on Ultra so much that they disregarded other indicators that were not confirmed by Ultra. And these plans were not broadcast by the enemy.<br />This was written from his own recollection, so it is not the complete history. It has nothing about the code breaking by other forces. This book provides new light on the previously known events.	2002-10-24

This book has 24 chapters, a ‘Selected Bibliography’, and an ‘Index’. This is a cultural history, not a detailed history on a particular subject. The ‘Introduction’ says WW II “killed more people and did more physical and psychological damage than ever before in history”. [A nuclear war would do even more damage (the radiation would affect those who survived the explosions).] It was like no other war. It resulted in many changes in the country because of the travel of so many who would never have left their county (p.226). The chapters discuss aspects of life that are not covered in histories that only mention battles, dates, and the names of politicians and commanders. It is worth reading, but your interest may vary from chapter to chapter.   Those who were old enough to remember some of these events can match it against their memories. The ‘Chronology’ starts with 1922 through 1945 (Japan surrendered on September 2nd). It only mentions the Great Depression in passing. This was as much a traumatic event for Americans. Could anyone write a similar book on “the 1980s”? The Great Depression caused the Stock Market Crash of 1929, not the reverse. Falling sales create a failing business. What other books cover details on the draft (Chapter 1); Camp Life (Chapter 2); Rationing (Chapter 6); and the war service of famous Americans (Chapter 9). LBJ was the first Congressman to join the military (there were eight). Rockets and jet airplanes were introduced in this war (Chapter 11). Chapter 21 tells about the development of the atomic bomb. Research was ahead in England and Germany. It tells about life in Los Alamos, “The Poplars”. Chapter 23 tells about various topics of the war, from personal histories (Calvin Graham) to the Doolittle Raid, the Battles of the Coral Sea, and the Battle of Midway.   This book should be read as an overall guide to WW II history. Mike Wright’s experience as a TV writer and producer allows him to pick interesting stories to educate and entertain the reader. The nine pages of Bibliography must have omitted most of the books published in the previous sixty years. He could have written many more books on WW II without any repetition.  The ‘Epilogue’ contains the author’s reminiscences about WW II and contrasts that to today’s world. Wright tells of the spontaneous celebrations at war’s end (pp.320 322). The ‘Selected Bibliography’ lists many selected books, but no explanation as how they were selected. Some deal with a particular topic in English.   There are some minor mistakes in this book. On page 66 Wright says a Liberty ship “carried about 11 tons”. That would be more like 11 thousand tons. That boxer’s name was “Buddy Baer” (p.78). Wright doesn’t mention Dusko Popov’s book about his assignment to spy on Pearl Harbor in July 1941. The Japanese code ‘Purple’ was broken two years before the war started (p.213). This attack could not have been a surprise. Why did the Japanese wave to Doolittle’s planes (p.274)? The American insignia then had a red circle, similar to Japanese planes! Doolittle’s raid was a political act, but it led to a military victory at Midway (p.277). Allied troops invaded Italy in 1943, not 1944 (p.284).	2002-10-20

Some were nationally famous, others not. He offers comments about various topics, and also talks about his life. This book lacks an index and photographs. The wordiness of this book reminds me of 19th century novels. Spence tells about his career as an insurance company lawyer. In effect, he showed up after the accidents and halted compensation to the victims. Until he rejected this work and vowed never to work for a corporation again.   Spence represented the Silkwood estate against the Kerr-McGee company. Karen was killed on her way to meet a reporter. Her plant manufactured plutonium for breeder reactors; this was a deadly threat to the profits and influence of Big Oil and their puppets in government. Karen allegedly fell asleep at the wheel after leaving a cafe. Didn't something like this happen to one of the witnesses at the Grassy Knoll?   Page 183 tells how support for the anti-nuclear movement came from &#34;certain charities and funding organizations&#34;. Are these the hidden hands of Big Oil? Page 216 quotes a witness &#34;there is no safe level for radiation&#34;. Spence argued &#34;if the lion gets away, Kerr-McGee has to pay&#34;; any deadly thing (like plutonium) requires absolute control by the owner. He won the case, but it was overturned by appointed judges (p.458-460). Page 328 tells of advice on cross-examination of a witness. &#34;Don't get angry. Don't rise to the bait. Answer only when you're ready. And if you're confused, say so, and above all, tell the truth. Its easy to remember the truth.&#34;   Spence is opposed to the death penalty (like Earl Rogers). But pages 367-371 give the strongest argument that I've read for the death penalty. Not as punishment or a deterrence, but simply so society can survive without fear. Pages 379-383 gives his talk to an ABA convention on the subject of trial lawyers. They are the foot soldiers in the front trenches of the justice system. Ithink this is one of the most important parts of the book. Our lawyers are the virtual descendants of warriors who settled trials by combat.   One case was the murder charge against Ed Cantrell. I wonder if he was the scapegoat for the alleged corruption in Rock Springs Wyoming&#62; TV and newspapers created something out of nothing (pp. 453-457). Anyone who believes everything the media broadcast and print must read this. You may then be able to understand the reporting on some other trials.	2002-10-18

Little did I realize that in twenty years another Pope would be bumped off to put another reactionary Pope into power.    This book points out the politics and personalities that went into the decision to eliminate Pope John Paul I. Afterwards, some of the reforms did go thru, perhaps due to the banking scandals of the 1980s, and other events that followed Vatican II.    Back in 1981 a State Dept. employee was kicked out of Nicaragua because she tried to poison their Foreign Minister (also a cleric). The poison to be used was said to be undetectable unless they knew what to look for. The symptoms made it look like the flu, and the cause would likely be overlooked. I wonder how many times this was used in other times and places?     Pages 40-49 tell of a swindle using counterfeit bonds worth $635 million.  They would be sold to the Vatican Bank, and the money used for payoffs, and buying control of a company.  The bank would write this off as a loss.  You can be sure of high-level corruption and collusion in the bank! The murder of Pope John Paul I may never be solved officially.  Perhaps another Pope would continue his proposed reforms; we'll see in the near future.	2002-10-17

Part I tells about the events of 1922. After the murders no indictments occurred! Part II tells of the events in 1926. A divorce action against the former Hall's maid alleged a pay-off to keep quiet. The NY Daily Mirror publicized this, and NJ Governor Moore ordered a new investigation. Four indictments followed. Part III tells of the five weeks of trial; all were found not guilty. The murders were never solved. In Part IV Kunstler fantasizes about it being a Klan killing. No proof is given, he only argues by analogy. No group of men were seen there. I wonder if this is part of a whitewash? There is no mention of public opinion from these times.<br />The Reverend Hall married Frances Stevens, 37 years old, a few years before she inherited millions (with her brothers). Around this time Mrs. Eleanor Mills became active in church affairs. Married at 17, perhaps to escape an unhappy home life, she soon had two children. She sought the mirage of happiness in closeness to her minister. But this minister married for money; love was a secondary concern. Their meetings were not secret from their close associates.<br />On Thursday September 14, 1922 Mrs. Mills read an article justifying divorce for a minister. She cut it out and called Reverend Hall for a meeting; he soon left to meet her. Mrs. Mills boarded a trolley then walked to De Russey's Lane. Reverend Hall left his house by 7:30PM and was seen walking to this location. They were never seen alive again. Saturday morning 9-16-1922 a young couple went for a walk down De Russey's Lane and turned into a grassy path. They found two bodies near a crabapple tree, then ran to Easton Ave to call the police. The missing couple was found.<br />Four people who lived nearby heard shots or screams around midnight Thursday (p.31). The affair between the minister and the choir singer became public knowledge. Next month they learned of the testimony of the \\"Pig Woman\\". While riding a mule to follow a suspected thief, she saw two men and two women arguing near a crabapple tree. There was a shot, and someone fell to the ground. She heard a woman scream, then more shots (p.70). She had tried to tell her story earlier, but was put off (p.72). Detectives accompanied her reconstruction; it checked out.<br />I believe that Frances, Henry, and Willie went looking for the missing minister, and found them together. Frances asked Edward to kneel and promise to sin no more. Willie, covering him with his pistol, touched it off. They then chose to finish the job (p.29). Future events would tell of witnesses paid to vanish or forget. Who was paid to kill the investigation in 1922? [If they were to find the missing gold watch buried in the Hall's garden we would know the truth.]	2002-10-07

His career provides lessons to the modern world and to modern warfare. It was his conscious exploitation of the economic and psychological factors of war in his \\"March through Georgia\\" which helped to end the Civil War. The long and expensive battles in Northern Virginia were replayed on the battlefields of France in the Great War.<br />The Union attempted to take Richmond by the shortest and most direct route; but this way was blocked with natural obstacles. If the Confederates fell back they would be closer to their reserves, supplies, and reinforcements. These facts favored the entrenched defenders.<br />The western campaign ended in the capture of Vicksburg and control of the Mississippi from St. Louis to New Orleans. Liddell Hart contrasts the maneuvers here to the stalemate back east. But the conditions, or politics, did not allow a wide flanking invasion through West Virginia or North Carolina. The threat to Richmond kept Confederate troops there. Longstreet proposed an invasion of Kentucky, a far flanking attack, but was turned down by Lee.<br />It explains how Sherman out-maneuvered Johnston from  Chattanooga to Atlanta. By threatening to outflank Johnston, the Confederates fell back. His replacement by Hood did not prevent the capture of Atlanta. This revived the hope of victory for the North, and helped to re-elect Lincoln.<br />Sherman then abandoned his supply and communication lines (vulnerable to attack) and marched on to Savannah and the ocean. His army lived off the land. This enabled his army to be resupplied by the Navy. He then marched north, seeming to attack other cities, but passed between and continued to destroy railroads and bridges.<br />The end came soon after this, as other armies invaded the South. Sherman designed an armistice and amnesty where the Confederates would be disbanded, and their arms turned over to the states. The latter would allow repression of bandits and guerillas. He was criticized for this.<br />Sherman was a man of modest habits. When admirers raised [money]to buy him a house, he refused to accept unless he received bonds that would pay the taxes! He lived within his means. The resisting power of a state depends more on the strength of popular will than on the strength of its armies, and this depends on economic and social security (p.429).<br />Liddell Hart gave preference to contemporaneous correspondence rather than Official Reports (which are written for history to justify a policy). Some of the ideas in this 72-year old book may not coincide with more recent history.	2002-09-19
1408503:US	38002140	R2HFG0WNLGO9X0	0895872463	278274501	Torso: The Story of Eliot Ness and the Search for a Psychopathic Killer	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Cleveland's "Jack the Ripper"	In the 1930s over a dozen murders were attributed to the \\"Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run\\", a ravine that runs through Cleveland Ohio and contains this stream and railroad yards. Most of these bodies were unidentified: headless, the arms, legs, and torso were cut up by someone who knew anatomy or butchering. It was never solved, altho one suspect was made to confess, repudiated this confession, and then found a suicide in jail. Such serial murders were rare in America; earlier serial murderers did it for money and left this trail. No motive was ever established for these murders. Most sex murderers are the product of large cities, which have anonymous victims or perpetrators. Chapter Eleven summarizes these cases.     This book is about the later career of Eliot Ness. After Chicago, he was put in charge of the Alcoholic Tax Unit of norther Ohio. He cleaned out bootleggers, hitting a still every day. Organized crime made Cleveland a safe haven for criminals on the run. Corruption had spread everywhere; neighborhood crime had greatly increased. Harold Burton became mayor, and chose Eliot Ness as Director of Public Safety to oversee the police and firemen. (Burton later became a Senator, a friend of Truman, and was appointed to the Supreme Court.) The ineffectiveness of the police was due to widespread corruption and complacency. With Prohibition gone, Ness prosecuted gambling and union racketeering. Ness cultivated a good relationship with reporters, and got favorable publicity. He tried to purge corrupt policemen but was met with silence. Then a police captain was caught in a cemetery lot racket. Another owned a restaurant which fronted for a gambling room. The bodies found in Kingsbury Run highlighted the corruption.     Cleveland had been the worst city (after Los Angeles) for traffic deaths and injuries. Ness purged the traffic division, began arresting drunk drivers, prosecuted ticket fixing, gave harsher penalties for unpaid fines, and started tougher automobile inspections. Ness promoted traffic safety with a public awareness campaign. He began an Emergency Patrol with first aid training to reach any accident within two minutes. This cut traffic deaths by half, and he received national recognition. Some of the increased traffic fines were put back into the police budget. Squad cars now had two-way radios. A single phone call brought police assistance within 60 seconds. Ness was criticized for wasting tax dollars, but in one year overall crime dropped 38%, robberies by 50%! Public success was followed by private problems: divorce, late night socializing, stories of drinking.     Ness later resigned to join the Federal Social Protection Program during WW 2. Afterwards, he became a businessman but was not successful. His campaign for Mayor of Cleveland flopped. He later met Oscar Fraley and began to write his book. Just before its publication, Ness died of a heart attack; he never knew of its success.	2002-09-15
1420476:US	38002140	R22B0SGICGQ26I	0806121505	489108827	Cavalier in Buckskin: George Armstrong Custer and the Western Military Frontier (Oklahoma Western Biographies)	Books	5	7	11	N	N	Bringing the Indian Problem to a Final Solution	This biography of George Armstrong Custer devotes most of its pages to his post Civil War career. Most people only know that he died at the Little Bighorn battle; they know the legend or the symbol, not the real person. Chapter 1 discusses his legend from 1876 to the present. Before his last campaign Custer charged the Grant administration with fraud and corruption. So whether he was a \\"victim of Grant's Indian policy\\" or a \\"foolhardy glory hunter\\" depended on the politics of the beholder.<br />Custer's postwar career depended on the support of Sherman and Sheridan (\\"Custer never let me down\\"). Since the Indians kept far away from the railroads, building the Northern Pacific railroad would ethnically cleanse the northern Dakota territory. The railroads were given tens of thousands of square miles of land (\\"sunblasted in summer, frozen in winter\\" p.125). They could not be sold to settlers until Indians were removed and neutralized. Settlers would then buy railroad lands, then use the railroad to transport their produce and supplies. The army's task was to implement this political policy; they only followed orders. There were treaties such as at Medicine Lodge in October 1867. But the Indians had no idea that they were giving up the country they claimed as their own (p.59). <br />The announced purpose of the Black Hills Expedition of 1874 was to find a site for a new fort, and for scientific exploration. The discovery of gold meant that miners would flock to these Indian lands via the Northern Pacific. The chief geologist, and Lt. Col. Fred Grant, cast doubt on this report: it might have been planted (p.141)! These lands could not be developed while the Indians held title, unless a war was created to negate the treaty (p.147). The Interior Dept. issued an ultimatum to the Sitting Bull bands: move to the Great Sioux Reservation or be driven in (p.156). But the Indians were immobilized in winter! Their failure to migrate was used to start a war. The military campaign started in April 1876. Custer believed that the Indians should be civilized into Christian farmers, but \\"if I were an Indian I often think that I would prefer to adhere to the free open plains rather than submit to a reservation\\" (p.149).<br />Just before his last campaign Custer testified against the actions of Secretary of War Belknap. Was he looking for some heroic action to gain popular acclaim? Was he suffering from any ailment that could affect his judgment? Chapter 9 discusses the \\"Judgments\\" on the defeat. Utley wonders if Custer received his chest wound at the beginning of the battle, and this demoralized and confused their defense? This would account for much that is puzzling about the battle (p.199). Those paintings of \\"Custer's Last Stand\\" are imagined. The Sioux fired their rifles and arrows from long range while concealed (p.190). They were too smart for a \\"Charge of the Light Brigade\\".	2002-09-03

Some are controversial, and some will never be solved to most people's satisfaction. But they all make for interesting reading. Each chapter lists books for further reading.<br />Chapter 14 discusses the death of Davy Crockett. Contemporary reports said he surrendered, then was executed. This also happened to the Anglos after the defeat in Zacatecas, the state that also rebelled against the seizure of power by Santa Ana.<br />Chapter 15 discusses the battle of Gettysburg, and how General Lee hoped to use JEB Stuart's cavalry. He didn't mention that George Armstrong Custer's cavalry defeated Stuart and helped the Union victory.<br />Chapter 18 deals with Sacco and Vanzetti. Dr. Henry C. Lee's \\"Famous Crimes Revisited\\" has a chapter that tells of the forged ballistic evidence. It also has a chapter on the Lindbergh kidnapping: Hauptmann did not write that ransom note! Why did the dog do nothing on that night?<br />Chapter 22 asks if FDR knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor in advance; the answer is YES. Curt Gentry's 1989 biography of J Edgar Hoover notes that in July 1941 Ian Fleming brought in a Nazi spy who was assigned to scout Pearl Harbor to see if an attack was feasible. Robert B Stinnett's \\"Day of Deceit\\" finally solved this question when he discovered an action plan from October 1940. It listed the steps necessary to provoke Japan into war. When the last step was taken in July 1941, Japan decided to go to war.<br />Chapter 23 asks if dropping the atom bomb on Japan was necessary. There was a secret protocol to the Yalta Treaty. Stalin agreed to break their Peace Treaty and attack Japan 90 days after the end of the European war. The first bomb on August 6 did not end the war. Russian declared war on August 9 and swept through Manchuria. The Japanese Militarists then knew that resistance was futile.<br />Chapter 25 ask \\"Who Killed JFK?\\". It took hardened criminalsto pull the triggers, experienced agents to plan this executive action, and high-level members of the ruling class to cover it up. The 1974 novel \\"Winter Kills\\" by Richard Condon provides a symbolic solution. Mark North's \\"Act of Treason\\" builds on the work of others.<br />Chapter 29 discusses the missing 18 minutes on that Nixon tape. About twenty years ago I saw a TV interview of Nixon; he said the missing minutes were \\"about the Bay of Pigs\\". H R Haldeman's \\"The Ends of Power\\" explain this code word.<br />Chapter 30 deals with the Reagan's selling government property (military arms) to the Iranians, and then diverting this money to private parties (rebels in Nicaragua). This violation of the law could have been used to impeach Reagan! Reagan's chosen biographer said \\"Reagan was senile in his second term\\"; he was truly the Acting President.	2002-08-29
1436510:US	38002140	RJRN8BZ1YJONS	1573929859	907363783	Cracking Cases: The Science of Solving Crimes	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Find Nothing But the Truth	Cracking Cases: The Science of Solving Crimes, by Dr. Henry C Lee  Forensics is the application of science to matters of law. It is both an art and a science: intuition and common sense are needed. More murders occur during holidays: stress, pressure, alcohol, and confrontations. This book covers his investigation into five cases of spousal murder. The author mentions his co-workers for each case, and other background material.  Chapter 1 tells of a couple driving in the rain. During an argument the wife jumps out of the car. While searching the highway the husband strikes and kills his wife. The lack of exterior damage to the van says murder, not a traffic accident. Blood spatters inside the van tell a story. The description of evidence reads like it came out of a textbook. Page 54 says \\"a red blood cell is about 7.6 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness\\"; shouldn't that be micrometers?  Chapter 2 tells of the disappearance of a spouse. It changed the law to not depend on finding a body for proof of homicide. Only a few bone fragments and teeth were found. The husband passed a lie detector test; page 105 tells of one trick to use. The spouse's friends reported her missing; the house was searched, and evidence was found. Page 120 lists a \\"Nanurrn Pistole\\"; shouldn't that be \\"Manurhin\\"?  Chapter 3 tells of a worst case scenario in this country's media. Dr. Lee was called for questions on certain troublesome facts (p.162). He joined the defense team because of \\"a number of intractable and critical errors had been made by some of the investigators ... and that the alleged findings did not bear the stamp of truth\\" (p.165). The found bloody glove had parts stuck together, but none of the leaves or twigs! This suggests it was planted hours later. After the blood sample was received, it was taken to the crime scene instead of logging it in as evidence. This was a very serious mistake which compromised the sample itself and the chain of custody (p.193). Dr. Lee noticed theyfailed to collect the blood drops on the female victim's back that came from above her body (p.195)! The cyclone fence and the vegetation behind the guest house showed that no one climbed over this fence (p.197). The Deputy Coroner testified the forensic evidence placed the deaths after 11PM (p.202). Pages 211-3 list critical questions on this case. The blood on the back gate was fresher although it was collected three weeks later. Swatches that dried overnight somehow left bloodstains. The jury decided 'not guilty' after three hours, but the court of public opinion is talking longer.  Chapter 4 tells of the importance of establishing time of death. After leaving Friday evening, the husband called home from a friend's house. Their daughter listened in and heard a one-sided conversation. This chapter ends with methods used to estimate time of death.  Chapter 5 tells of the importance of preserving the crime scene and the physical evidence (blood, gun shot residue, bullet trajectory). The husband called in to report that his wife shot herself on the left side of her head. She was right handed and had no blood spatter on either hand; no fingerprints were found on the gun. \\"Something wrong here.\\"  The Epilogue suggests marriages with very deep domestic conflicts can end up in tragedy. There was minimal marriage counseling in these cases.  << The above review was misfiled. Here is the correct review. >>  Cracking More Cases, Henry C. Lee, MD -- More Forensic Investigations  Dr. Henry C. Lee is a professor of forensic science at the University of New Haven, and has been a consultant for over three-hundred police and law enforcement agencies, and an expert witness for the prosecution and defense in many high-profile cases. The `Prologue' explains that technological breakthroughs have enabled the police to re-open and solve very old cold cases. Why is there such an increase in forensic investigations? The OJ case in 1995 and the `CSI' show since 2000 has popularized this arcane science. Three of these five cases have received more publicity. The news media can assist investigators (p.12). He compliments Alex Hunter for doing the right thing (p.13). Thomas W. O'Neil is a professional writer and a professor of English.  Chapter 1 is about the 1973 murder of Penney Serra in a public parking garage in daytime. At age ten Penney became the homemaker for a younger sister and father after her mother died. After high school she worked for a dentist. On Friday July 16 Penney went to town on errands and parked her car at 12:42 PM. After 1 PM a parking employee returned from lunch and found her body by a staircase. The police were called. Blood spots created a trail (p.23). Bloody fingerprints were in her car (p.24). An attendant remembered a young man with long dark hair. Penney was stabbed in her chest. The witnesses were used to create a drawing, it did not resemble Penney's old boyfriend closely, his family said he was at work. A mechanic's rag on the car floor was a clue, but untraceable like the fingerprints (p.30). The crime was recreated (p.39). Twenty-one years later a man beat his girlfriend and was arrested; his fingerprint matched the one from the Serra case (p.43). Edward R. Grant was arrested and convicted because of the DNA and fingerprint evidence after 29 years (p.61). The key to solving cold cases is to never give up (p.63). [Note how blood spots show up on a light blue dress.]  Chapter 2 is about the murder of Martha Moxley in 1975. The crime scene was contaminated, the case turned cold. The pages tell about the background of the Moxley and Skakel families. What are their children like? Can a wealthy family intimidate local law enforcement (p.84)? Can you believe what you see on TV (p.101)? A newspaper article in November 1995 created a sensation (p.102). In June 2002 Michael Skakel was convicted (p.112). The autopsy was delayed (p.115), and evidence was missing. \\"The absence of evidence is equally as important as the presenceof evidence\\" (p.116). Reliance on polygraph tests was a mistake. This crime could have been solved many years earlier (p.119).  Chapter 3 is about the JonBenet Ramsey murder in December 1996. It was well-publicized and unusual for a small town (p.122). The crime scene wasn't properly secured and protected (p.123). [Is there something wrong in making young girls into beaauty queens (p.132)?] Was the interest in this case a \\"sick curiosity\\" (p.185)? DA Alex Hunter decided that there was \\"probable cause\\" but not \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" (p.190). Patsy and John answered the detective's questions (pp.201-204). Detectives studied the 15-room house (p.211). It remains unsolved today.  Chapter 4 is the Lisa Peng case, arrested for the murder of her husband's mistress and baby (p.255). After a mistrial, the second trial convicted her (p.258). This was overturned. There was a plea deal (p.263). There is a Summary about these problems (pp. 264-265).  Chapter 5 is the Suzan Barratt case. Forensic investigators' work is long, tedious, and painstaking (p.267). There is human error (p.268). Stephen Haines was found dead in his garage with bruises and abrasions on his body. Suzan Barratt admitted hitting him with a wine bottle (p.272). Haines was an alcoholic and hemophiliac (an explanation for bleeding and bruises). \\"Very few individuals really know the true facts ... of the case\\" (p.281). Talk-show hosts (actors on radio) are entertainers who affect public opinion that can lead to false convictions. The statements of Barratt were not admitted, the charges were dropped (p.283). The `Epilogue' warns against making simple mistakes. The investigators should keep an open mind and only use the evidence to lead to a solution.	2002-08-19
1441203:US	38002140	ROPP92VG6R9Z	0930330358	457653994	A Private Disgrace: Lizzie Borden by Daylight (Library of Crime Classics)	Books	3	8	14	N	N	The Novelist Tells the Legend	The author (VL) grew up on the next block in Fall River; VL knew Lizzie from the \\"dubious source of in-group hearsay\\". Lizzie Borden was the sane, civilized woman accused of a madman's crime. The case interests many because of her sole opportunity to commit the crime, yet the idea of guilt is incredible. There are two legends. One was a simple, warm hearted girl who became the victim of the police and an ambitious DA. The other was a grasping murderess who lusted after a fortune (p.29). Up on the Hill they thought Lizzie did it, also loved her Dad, but suffered from a \\"spell\\" or temporary insanity seen in some families. Lizzie's mother suffered from migraine and fits of rage (p.47). The author claims a form of epilepsy for the crime.    VL claimed Lizzie's inquest testimony told what specific facts Bridget was paid not to tell. But does anyone have any proof that Bridget was ever paid to shield Lizzie? Page 38 tells of the good works Lizzie did before the tragedy. VL read both volumes of the Trial transcript and the preliminary investigation. VL believed Uncle John was used in a scheme to get Abby away from the house that morning, and mailed a letter to cover it up. VL also tells how the Fall River Globe and Providence Journal were against Lizzie, while those who knew her Dad were not. VL imagines a hiding place from the testimony about not searching \\"2 or 3 dresses\\" (p.153). Wasn't this confession of \\"culpable negligence\\" just a trick to make the jury believe that dress was there? Page 121 tells of a \\"broken off handle\\", but common sense says it was sawn off! Page 210 tells about Jennings secret documents kept hidden to his dying day, and beyond, to prevent their use in \\"any new phases of police investigation\\". VL notes circumstantial evidence stands while eyewitnesses may lie or be mistaken, and is the only evidence available for crimes done in secret. It may be questioned by \\"the man in the street\\" because it assumes or infers from the facts (p.215).    VL says Lizzie was lucky in that her judge was appointed to the bench when her lawyer was Governor. But I wonder if assigning the right judge to the right case is just payback time (p.229). The book skips over Kieran's testimony and its importance (p.235)! Kieran could not see his assistant from the doorway when he was on the floor, and could only see him if he turned his head when going down the steps. VL is also wrong in stating the hatchet found in the cellar was the murder weapon; we know now that the murder weapon left a shred of gilt paint in Abby's skull, so it was fairly new. And Knowlton knew this! VL also omits Justice Dewey's quotes on evidence and experts (p.291-4); it is as true today as then.    The verdict of 'not guilty' was followed by a lengthy joyous pandemonium of cheers. The Providence Journal was alone in expressing dissatisfaction (p.296). Book Six tells of the aftermath. Lizzie's unpopularity resulted from two events. The suppression of \\"The Fall River Tragedy\\" (based on articles from a newspaper) meant that people could not reread the story. The Tilden-Thurber episode of alleged shoplifting was the last straw. Could the Yankees on the Hill accept parricide but choke on shoplifting (p.305)? VL quotes Phillips as to \\"signs of a lack of balance in later years\\" (p.306). And Lizzie became declasse after that big Maplecroft party for actors. VL says Bridget later moved to Montana, married, had children, and died aged 86 years (p.313). She concludes by telling about Lizzie's later years, death, and funeral. Emma broke a leg after hearing this, and and died ten days later. All lie buried in Oak Grove cemetery. In 1991 Arnold R Brown published his solution to the crime. Lizzie (and Emma and Uncle John) were innocent of the murders, but not of the cover-up. Her concocted explanation of an epileptic seizure seems to have been copied from Raymond Chandler's \\"The Big Sleep\\".	2002-08-14

There is no mention of any DNA match. The other claims are just as misleading or one-sided. It ignores the testimony of the ME who did the autopsies: &#34;the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11PM&#34;. How was that black glove planted - see the &#34;Legacy of Deception&#34;. The limo driver picked up OJ at 11PM, giving him an alibi that caused the jury to find him not guilty, despite planted evidence. DP criticizes the prosecution lawyers as &#34;haggard&#34; and &#34;apologetic&#34;. I think this was caused by their reasonable doubts - they no longer believed OJ was guilty. DP then says &#34;from what little I knew at the time there wasn't any concrete proof that the incriminating evidence against Simpson had actually been planted by the police officers&#34;. What does he now know, and when did he know it?  Money was raised for the civil suit, they would not work on speculation. They appealed to the public. Yet they criticized OJ for raising money the same way! DP claims Paula dumped OJ, but he admits Paula returned from Las Vegas to sleep with OJ. Some break-up! Chapter Six tells about the depositions. DP will try to give the worst interpretation to any statement; he is so clever at this. Neither the agent at the LAX ticket counter, or the passenger on that flight, saw any cuts on OJ's fingers. He tells about his use of the Schwartzes. DP treats OJ's friends with disgust - because they don't think the way he wants them to think!! Chapter Thirteen says Fuhrman was a &#34;star witness&#34;. How could he alone find evidence that the other detectives did not see? &#34;He should have told the truth&#34;. DP suggests Kardashian hid the bloody clothes and knives! DP then claims the golf bag contained the bloody knife. Chapter Sixteen tells about the NationalEnquirer picture of OJ and those shoes. I remember those suede shoes were fuzzy but the sole had sharp details! There was a problem with the shadows, and the light on the sole. The Dec 1997 issue of 'Popular Mechanics' provides other examples of photo editing. This book has no pictures. Compare it to the other books, or true crime books in general.  Chapter Eighteen tells about the &#34;mock trial&#34;. They used people off the street, tried out various arguments, then picked the ones most likely to convict. Is this the 'triumph of justice'? DP says the blood evidence was collected before OJ returned home from Chicago. But he doesn't tell that the blood sample from OJ and from the victims was collected before the evidence was submitted for testing! Evidence tampering had a powerful effect on the mock jury, so DP decided to negate this topic. The right judge can determine whether you win or lose; the defendant's law firm had prior problems with this judge! DP tells how they eliminated jurors who knew of Fuhrman's perjury. Chapter Twenty One tells how the trial was fixed. All the evidence collected by the LAPD would be assumed to be correct. It could not be questioned unless there was new evidence. In effect, any previously disputed and doubted evidence became Official Fact! Did somebody plant the glove? Did somebody else get the victim's blood before the Crime Lab got the evidence? Yes, but it didn't matter! &#34;It does not matter how the evidence was collected&#34;. The defense was even prevented from arguing that anyone else was the killer! Only the evidence that showed Simpson was guilty would be allowed in the trial. Even Fuhrman's perjury would be excluded. DP says only the victim's or OJ's blood was found at the murder scene. But when the blood and skin found under Nicole's fingernails did not match OJ (or Ron or Nicole), they had a clever answer for this. OJ had no scratches or bruises at all. The blood on OJ's socks was less degraded than from the autopsy vial. Unpreserved blood would be more degraded, not less! Could this be a sign of manipulation of evidence? Read how DP cleverly turns this about. Note their care in framing questions so OJ could not say &#34;someone planted it&#34;. DP claims the limo driver said the Bronco was not in Rockingham at 10:03; but the limo driver did not arrive before 10:22! Is this honest?  Is absence of evidence a proof of guilt? DP cleverly misrepresents the purpose of the control swatch; they are NOT supposed to contain anyone's DNA. They tell of the questioned Buffalo photo. Since the camera was stolen, there was no way to corroborate the story! The defense's photo expert pointed to differences between the other negatives on the film. They claim &#34;the shoes in this particular photograph ... have not been altered or changed in any way&#34;. But the question was the photograph altered in any way? See it for yourself. Was Nicole was the target, and Ron the innocent bystander? The 25-30 wounds on Ron say he was the target of a frenzied attack, and Nicole was quickly killed as the innocent bystander. DP says &#34;they found blood dropped all over his house&#34;. In fact, drops of blood were found outside leading to the front door, but not inside the house. Were they planted by someone who had no access to the house? DP says the cuts on OJ were made by the victim's fingernails, but it did not match OJ by type or DNA! DP is one clever lawyer! The FBI and LAPD donated thousands of dollars of their services to assist a private litigant. You can decide if this is a vendetta of bias. The judge's instructions to the jury: the criminal verdict didn't matter, nor the custody verdict. Did his other rulings help to fix the case? DP does NOT tell that the verdict was timed to interfere with President Clinton's State of the Union address. Part of a right wing conspiracy? The last chapter claims OJ &#34;was worth substantially more&#34; than $25 million &#34;because of his notoriety as a famous killer&#34;. How big a lie is that? The red liquid blood found by the bodies after midnight says they were murdered after 11:30PM. OJ Simpson is innocent.  Chapter Twenty One tells how the trial was fixed. All the evidence collected by the LAPD would be assumed to be correct. It could not be questioned unless there was new evidence. In effect, any previously disputed and doubted evidence became Official Fact! Did somebody plant the glove? Did somebody else get the victim's blood before the Crime Lab got the evidence? Yes, but it didn't matter! &#34;It does not matter how the evidence was collected&#34; (p.279). The defense was even prevented from arguing that anyone else was the killer! Only the evidence that showed Simpson was guilty would be allowed in the trial (p.380). Even Fuhrman's perjury would be excluded (p.383). Page 415 says only the victim's or OJ's blood was found at the murder scene. But when the blood and skin found under Nicole's fingernails did not match OJ (or Ron or Nicole), they had a clever answer for this. OJ had no scratches or bruises at all. Page 442 tells about the blood on OJ's socks; it was less degraded than from the autopsy vial. Unpreserved blood would be more degraded, not less! Could this be a sign of manipulation of evidence? Read how DP cleverly turns this about. Page 450 tells of their care in framing questions so OJ could not say &#34;someone planted it&#34;. On page 511 DP claims the limo driver said the Bronco was not in Rockingham at 10:03; but he earlier testified he did not arrive before 10:20! Is this honest.?  Page 532 tells of OJ wearing a &#34;dark sweatsuit&#34;; did they find this at his home? Is absence of evidence a proof of guilt? DP cleverly misrepresents the purpose of the control swatch (p.567); they are NOT supposed to contain anyone's DNA. Page 573 tells of the questioned Buffalo photo. Since the camera was stolen, there was no way to corroborate the story. The defense's photo expert pointed to differences betweenthe other negatives on the film. Page 597 has the quote &#34;the shoes in this particular photograph ... have not been altered or changed in any way&#34;. But the question was the photograph altered or changed in any way? See it for yourself. Page 602 claims that Nicole was the target, and Ron the innocent bystander. The 25-30 wounds on Ron say he was the target of a frenzied attack, and Nicole was quickly killed as the innocent bystander.  On page 608 DP says &#34;they found blood dropped all over his house&#34;. In fact, drops of blood were found outside leading to the front door, but not inside the house. Were they planted by someone who had no access to the house? DP says the cuts on OJ were made by the victim's fingernails. But the blood under Nicole's fingernails did not match OJ by type or DNA! He is one clever lawyer! Page 616 notes that the FBI and LAPD donated thousands of dollars of their services to assist a private litigant. You can decide if this is a vendetta of bias. Page 623 tells of the judge's instructions to the jury. The criminal verdict didn't matter, nor the custody verdict. Did his other rulings help to fix the case? Page 626 tells of the verdict.  The last chapter claims OJ &#34;was worth substantially more&#34; than $25 million &#34;because of his notoriety as a famous killer&#34;. How big a lie is that? The red liquid blood found by the bodies after midnight says they were murdered after 11:30PM. OJ Simpson is innocent. Read the book and see for yourself. [&#34;Killing Time&#34; by Freed and Briggs is the one best book.]  The Case of the Framed Football Player  Dr. John H. Watson put down his newspaper. He did not expect that verdict in Los Angeles, he said. Sherlock Holmes put down his book and said he expected that verdict. “Why” said Watson? “It’s elementary, my dear Watson. The Grand Jury did not indict him, so it’s no surprise that the Petit Jury did not convict him.” “But the media kept saying the verdict would be guilty” said Watson. “But you know how the newspapers reported the cases we were involved in” said Holmes. “If you look at the time element and the condition of the accused there is no possibility of guilt” said Holmes. “I’m sorry Holmes, but I don’t understand” replied Watson.  Holmes explained the limo driver took the accused to the LA airport at 11 PM so he could not have killed two people afterwards. The limo driver arrived at 10:22 PM and waited until the scheduled 10:45 PM pickup time. He did not see or hear any SUV arrive during this time. That waiter checked out from work at 10 PM then walked to his home, changed out of his clothing, then walked a few blocks to get that car. If the murders occurred at 10:30 PM or so the blood would be black and clotted. You remember my monograph on this subject?” “So who could have done it” asked Watson. “It was most likely someone who was an enemy of that waiter” said Holmes. “The noise of the fight drew Nicole out of the safety of her house and she became a witness to the murder. So she had to be killed as well to eliminate an eyewitness.”  “Why would anyone want to kill the waiter” asked Watson? “If we knew the motive we would be able to find the killers” said Holmes. Holmes wondered if the waiter stopped somewhere and was followed. “We know little about his history” said Holmes. “Some say the method used to kill Nicole has been used by drug dealers against non-paying customers. I have no experience there” said Holmes. “The LAPD police should not have halted their investigation so soon” said Holmes. After the crime the experienced criminal defense lawyer had his client examined by a doctor and photographed nude from head to toe. There were no bruises or cuts and slashes anywhere on his body, except for a cut on one finger. This cut was not seen by Kato or the limo driver, the ticket agent or the other passengers on the airliner. The hands of the waiter showed bruises from punching somebody hard, he was trained in the martial arts. The blood evidence had EDTA which showed it came from the blood sample, and was planted evidence.  “I guess this will become an addition to that Famous Unsolved Mysteries book” said Watson. “What do you think”? Holmes reminded him of “The Case of the Long-Legged Models”. A woman inherited shares in a Las Vegas Casino after her father was murdered. It was never solved. “Murders by organized crime are seldom solved by the police unless they blame an innocent man” said her famous lawyer. He had covered the murder trial of Sir Harry Oakes for the Hearst Press. “What are the chance of learning a solution” asked Watson? Holmes replied “you mean learning the correct solution”. “Many have invented solutions that are contradicted by the known facts, only those who know little about this case believe them.”  What do YOU really know about this case?	2002-08-07

Lee Bailey in 1964 when he got Dr. Sam Shepard freed from a crime he didn't commit. Shepard was railroaded by a sensational and irresponsible newspaper; his life was ruined to sell advertising. Were things different 40 years later? This book tells of some of his cases, and his observations on the law.<br />Part I \\"The Torso Murder\\" tells of finding body parts, and the trial of the husband. There was no direct evidence against the husband; only the claim of a hobbyist polygrapher that the husband failed the \\"lie detector\\". Bailey's examination and comments are printed. A former business associate of the wife saw her weeks after she disappeared. The book tells of the tricks to discredit the witness: the police officer testified his story was false! But they contacted the priest who had accompanied this witness, and who verified the story. The defendant was acquitted. The next chapter tells of a defendant arrested on eyewitness identification years after the crime. The defendant did not match the description given by the victims. Eyewitness identifications are the greatest single cause of wrongful convictions. They were reliable in olden times when an eyewitness generally knew well the accused. <br />Part II reports \\"The Exoneration of Sam Shepard\\". This is so well known that nothing more needs to be said. Dr. Shepard's career was ruined and his life was crippled through false charges, poor investigation, and newspaper propaganda. Part III reports the Great Plymouth Mail Robbery: a million and a half in small bills were stolen from an ordinary mail truck. This crime was never solved, the money never recovered. Two of the suspects disappeared and were never found; possibly kidnapped and tortured to death by criminals. These chapters tell of the actions of the Postal Inspectors; these are facts, not fiction.<br />Part IV deals with the Boston Strangler and the solution to this case. It is a well known case where books have been written about it. PartV deals with the trials of Dr. Carl Coppolino. Tried in NJ for murdering a neighbor (not guilty), but convicted in FL for poisoning his wife. Bailey points out the weaknesses in the expert opinion against his client.<br />Part VI deals with corruption in Paterson NJ. A newspaper publisher who reported on links between underworld elements and the Passaic County Prosecutor was arrested for murder based on suborned perjury! This fact did not prevent two trials and acquittal in both cases. Bailey's appeal to the NJ Governor and others was used to censure him in MA and suspend him in NJ. Does NJ have the worst reputation in the eastern US? Read this chapter and you will understand why.<br />Part VII deals with \\"The State of the Law\\". It tells of the harm done by police lineups (if the victim is shown a mug shot before), the unreliability of eyewitness testimony (someone seen for a few seconds), etc. Innocence is irrelevant for any defendant! Anyone acquitted will forever be suspected as guilty. Bailey tells of the faults of the grand jury system: they are a rubber stamp for the prosecutor. This chapter gives an insider's view to things that are unknown to the public. This last chapter could be a summary of the book.	2002-07-25

Lee Bailey tells of his friendship and admiration for Dr. Cyril Wecht.  He also &#34;highlights a truth which most Americans do not readily comprehend: that our legal system is not in its essence 'a search for truth' at all. The system is in reality a search for those truths which at least one of the lawyers want to bring to the fore, and not those truths which are too hot ... for either of them to dare to handle&#34; (p.xvi). The Introduction tells of his personal history, experience, and expertise. &#34;Cyril Wecht is the Sherlock Holmes of forensic science&#34; says Alan Dershowitz. Or a Dr. Joseph Bell?   Chapter 1 deals with the assassination of JFK. The single bullet theory, from a scientific standpoint, is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth (p.22). It was one of the worst investigations of a homicide he has ever seen. The autopsy was done by a inexperienced military pathologists. He attempted to get the autopsy reports, which are public records, for the Garrison investigation; but the Federal government would not allow it! Page 35 tells of his examination of the physical evidence. The preserved brain of JFK was missing. Page 43 points out that the forensic pathologist who disagreed with him had economic dependencies with the Federal government. He tells of a computer program that can analyze photographs to show details not observable by the human eye (pp.51-3). It detected alterations in the autopsy photographs. Dr. Wecht helped to develop the scene in the movie &#34;JFK&#34; that demonstrated why the single bullet theory is silly. He found the attitude of the Kennedy family &#34;completely incomprehensible&#34; (p.74). [Perhaps they were authoritatively advised of a shameful genetic disorder that must be kept secret?]   Chapter 2 deals with the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The fatal bullet was most likely the first, which hit him behind hi right ear. The other two bullets were fired into his right armpit. [As if he threw up his right arm as he fell.] Sirhan was shooting from the front, and could not have killed RFK. The appointed defense lawyer never mentioned this. Chapter 3 deals with Chappaquiddick, the accident that killed Ted Kennedy's political future. No autopsy was done on Mary Jo Kopechne. The accident was considered just another weekend car crash (p.94). Any wooden bridge could be slippery with dampness. Page 101 teaches that you shouldn't tell Polish jokes when your judge is Polish; he denied their motion.   Chapter 4 deals with a Doctor convicted of murdering his wife. Dr. Wecht says for a jury to find a person not guilty, the jurors must feel that the defendant was framed by the police, or that it is possible that someone else committed the crime. Chapter 5 tells of the case of Jeffrey MacDonald. When a case is tried several years after the crime, the determination of what happened is limited to the evidence collected at the time. Jeffrey started a new life, then his father-in-law started a crusade to convict him. The old scars could be either self-inflicted or the result of multiple attackers. Jeffrey's psychological profile did not suggest a person who would suddenly snap and kill his wife and children Chapter 6 tells of his review of the toxicology report of Elvis Presley. Many drugs were present; the levels suggested accidental death, not suicide. Dr. Nick was indicted for over-prescribing drugs for the King, but acquitted (p.147). Other chapters deal with Jean Harris, and Claus von Bulow. They are warnings against the recreational use of drugs. The other interesting stories deal with lesser known people. In dozens of cases a person appeared guilty, but the evidence was circumstantial and the person was innocent (pp.180-1). Page 196 explains why a defendant should not testify if they are &#34;very self-confident&#34;.	2002-07-20

The accuracy and fairness of crime lab evidence are entirely dependent on proper identification, protection, and transfer of evidence from the crime scene. The Introduction explains how a seeming accident was found to be murder by analyzing the entrance wound and the position of the shotgun. Forensic pathology investigates sudden, violent, or unexplained deaths. 75% of all deaths are from natural causes, 75% of the rest are accidental. About 1.5% are suicides and homicides. Many of the most controversial cases on record have involved medical examiner systems, due to political influence (p.9).<br />Chapter 1 deals with the Trial of OJ Simpson, and the evidence for guilt or innocence. One of the biggest mistakes was to not get a forensic pathologist to the scene immediately; important evidence was lost forever (p.34). Nicole's stomach contents were discarded; if empty, then 3 or more hours elapsed since her last meal. Page 43 tells of the high error rate in laboratory testing of blood and other specimens. Nicole's uncorroborated diary wrote of being followed to a \\"Payless shoe store\\". Would a fan of fashion and style ever go there? Page 49 says there is NO regulation on DNA testing, or of the astronomical percentage estimates. Page 59 tells that two weeks after the murders there was no blood on those socks; weeks later there was! Page 67 says no cuts were seen on OJ's hands on the flight to Chicago. Page 70 tells of Cochran's wearing that knitted cap; to me, it looked like a child's cap.<br />Chapter 2 discusses the suicide of Vincent Foster, and how rumor mongers blew it up into a fantasy (p.81). Chapter 3 tells of his investigations into the aftermath of Waco. This was a tragedy that never should have occurred (p.100). Chapter 4 tells of a shoot-out in Cleveland; the coroner's staff was guilty of deliberate, willful, and clever deception (p.114). Chapter 5 tells of a shooting in Chicago where \\"this whole operation may have been nothing more than a political assassination\\" (p.131). The State Attorney and the police officers involved in the raid were charged, and found at fault (p.134). Chapter 6 deals with the 1989 Oakland earthquake. Many who died would be alive if state and local emergency management officials had done their jobs quickly and efficiently (p.142). The autopsy reports were done by the lowest bidder, and the reports had the lowest quality (p.146). Chapter 7 tells of the nightclub fire in 1977 Cincinnati. Many did not die of burns or smoke inhalation, but from invisible and odorless toxic fumes (p.162).<br />Chapter 8 explains why a fall from a high building was homicide and not suicide or an accident. Chapter 9 investigated the mysterious death of a government opponent; it was an accident. Chapter 10 tells of the unexpected death of a government official; it was a natural death. Chapter 11 tells of the execution of a maid that caused an international incident. Chapter 12 deals with the swine flu panic of 1976, a result from using \\"Legionnaires Disease\\" to allocate money and authority to the CDC and FDA (p.231). At least 52 people died after receiving swine flu vaccine. Chapter 13 tells of a man serving a life sentence for stabbing his wife and her parents. Fingerprints found at the scene did not match the suspect, the victims, or those who were in the house before the murders (p.247). After the State forced the defense lawyer off the case, he was convicted at the third trial (p.258)! Pages 259-60 tell why a jury will convict even if the evidence is unconvincing! Chapter 14 tells of his viewing of an 18 minute videotape of an autopsy on an unknown being. He could not say it was a hoax.	2002-07-15
1477155:US	38002140	R160TE1TR80W4G	1573928615	609395732	The Gun Control Debate : You Decide (Contemporary Issues)	Books	5	14	24	N	N	Articles on the Controversy	This book contains various articles that deal with the natural right to keep and bear arms, for and against. You can read this book to educate yourself on opposing viewpoints. They date from the 1970s and 1980s, but their arguments are still valid. Since then 33 of the 48 states have passed \\"right to carry\\" laws. South Dakota and Vermont have virtually no gun controls; you can compare their crime and violence to areas with strict gun controls. But owner-operated small businesses overwhelmingly predominate: no powerful corporations to restrict the rights of the people.<br /><br />Gun control goes back thousands of years: the aristocracy has always sought to disarm the common people the better to exploit them. Aristotle's Politics explains how democracy came to Greece once the common people were armed. Nineteenth century America was well armed. The Sullivan Law meant a citizen must prove a \\"reasonable need\\" to own and carry a handgun; the ordinary citizen is always rejected (unless they know somebody). The law disarmed the people, and was followed by increased crime and violence. Organized crime became more powerful after the people were disarmed. An armed militia of citizens could quickly put an end to them.<br /><br />Low violence rates in Europe preceded their gun laws. After gun laws were passed in America crime rates grew. Recent reports say crime rates skyrocketed after Gt. Britain confiscated all guns. When will they ever learn?<br /><br />Chapter 13 is from the 'New England Journal of Medicine' of June 12, 1986 by Arthur L. Kellermann and Donald T. Reay. No information is given on their backgrounds. From other sources you will learn that Kellermann was at John Hopkins University when he wrote this article, and later left to go to Emory University. The medical examiner of Kings County WA investigated 743 deaths from firearms. The results were 84% suicides, 13% homicides, and 3% accidents. From the percentages of victims (family, friends, and strangers) Kellermann concocted his statistic of a gun being 43 times more likely to kill a family member than an intruder. This statistic was heavily publicized in the press. There are five things wrong with this article.<br /><br />1) It did not report on deaths in homes without any gun as a control. This is not scientific! Reports from other sources say a family member is 99 times more likely to be killed in a gun-free home than an intruder. Kellermann's statistics are flawed by design.<br /><br />2) The suicide rate is lower and the murder rate is higher in America; suicide rates are higher and the murder rate is lower in countries that ban private ownership of guns (see Chapter 13). The total of suicides and murders is the rate of violent deaths; this provides a comparison. Most suicides occur in the home, so much so that the phrase \\"died at home\\" is a euphemism in obituary columns. A death in the home is much more likely for a family member than a stranger. America's high rate of gun ownership prevents home invasion crimes common to England and Europe.<br /><br />3) Most assaults and murders occur between people who are known to each other. This makes homes potentially more dangerous that streets or shopping malls. The exception is for illegal activities; just read your daily newspaper. Children are always much safer in school than at home or in their neighborhood.<br /><br />4) Another truth is that medical journals require payment to publish articles. It is another form of advertising or opinion molding. What millionaire's \\"foundation grant\\" was paying Kellermann to create his biased report?<br /><br />5) Nothing in life is guaranteed, neither safety or liberty. Chapter 13 provides a comparison for violent deaths, but omits statistics for South American countries which have a similar colonial history. Isn't it true that countries that ban citizens from owning guns also oppress their citizens in other ways? You can look that up in a history book, or your newspaper.<br /><br />The real problem in Gun Prohibition is its prelude to political oppression by lower wages and higher taxes. Just look at what happened since 1969! Wages were \\"stagnant\\" (the euphemism for being kept lower), taxes were higher (my state sales tax doubled). Nixon's devaluation of the dollar inllated the currency so more was paid in Federal taxes. Reagan increased Federal tax rate from 9% to 15%, the Social Security tax was also raised 50% (4% to 6%). This is the same form of oppression practiced in conquered countries during WW II.	2002-07-13

Stephenson was sent to New York in 1940 to protect British shipping of war material (and to gather information on enemy activities for appropriate counter measures), and to promote public opinion in favor of American intervention on the side of Britain. Any offensive actions would have to remain secret. This was part of Economic Warfare.<br /><br />Chapter 2 documents the important political decisions made at the time by President Roosevelt and others in 1940. Fifty coal burning destroyers were sent to Britain at a critical time. The Sperry bomb sight was leased after they learned the Germans had the plans. Chapter 3 tells of the propaganda campaign to discredit isolationists and Nazi supporters, and the methods used to cripple or harass German officials. Censorship of the mails was used to track down spies and saboteurs. Chapter 4 tells of the intrigues with the Vichy French government. The personal secretary of the Vichy ambassador was recruited into a business to gain knowledge of his affairs. This was used to discredit the Embassy. A British agent was placed in close contact with the Embassy to gain information from her male friends.<br /><br />Chapter 5 tells of the Special Operations of economic warfare: to manufacture evidence of the facts believed to be true but which could not otherwise be proved! They had a laboratory to fabricate letters and other documents. The imprint of any typewrite on earth could be reproduced faultlessly. It tells how letters were created to condemn a Czech collaborator! Another game was to subject Fascist sympathizers to petty persecution to waste time in confusion,and get them into trouble. It tells how a forged letter was created to cause the cancellation of the Italian airline franchise, an important Axis channel of communication. Brazil then broke with the Axis. Chapter 6 tells of the OSS during WW2. Stephenson did everything to help Donovan get the position. The new organization faced two bureaucratic rivals: the FBI, and the military intelligence departments. It was mainly through the assistance of BSC that they survived. Intelligence and other trained experts were put at Donovan’s disposal. It explains how a short wave station in Boston was used to broadcast propaganda.<br /><br />Chapter 7 repeats various anecdotes from the war. They used astrological predictions for propaganda! The techniques to use polling to control voting and win elections was written in 1943 by David Ogilvy. Since then the US Government has used these techniques both overtly and covertly. It tells how stories were given to principal journalists and feature writers, and how columnist Drew Pearson acquired information. Chapter 8 tells how President Roosevelt sent a message to Stephenson on November 27: “Japanese negotiations off. Services expect action within two weeks”. How this happened is a matter of history. There is a discussion on the use and value of double agents. He tells of the training given to secret agents at Oshawa. Sabotage to French locomotives alone nearly equaled the number disabled by air action. The information from a Soviet code clerk in Canada exposed their spy system. The final tribute was that the BSC helped to reduce the number of American casualties.<br /><br />Does this book show how a small group shapes and controls the events that affect our lives?	2002-07-10

Yallop wrote four previous works (one caused the British government to reopen a twenty-year old murder case, another freed a man serving a life sentence for murder).  This investigates the mysterious death of Albino Luciani, Pope John Paul I.  He spent three years of intensive investigation using various sources in Rome, New York, London, and South America; they cannot be publicly identified.     Luciano Albini opposed the looting of Banco Ambrosiano while Bishop of Venice.  As Pope he would rid the Vatican Bank of swindlers, money launderers, drug dealers, and their allies.  But these had connections with organized crime and certain intelligence agencies.  Pope John Paul I was as doomed as President John F. Kennedy's attempts to curtail the military-industrial complex, and Big Oil.     In 1981 there was an attempt to poison the Foreign Minister of El Salvador: the poison was to be put into his alcoholic drink.  Nothing would happen for a week, then he would develop a flu-like disease, and die the next day.  This poison could not be detected unless the coroner knew what to look for.  This plot was exposed by the double agent recruited for the job, and a US diplomat was expelled from the country.  The newspapers did NOT compare this to the death of Pope John Paul I.     Pages 40-49 tell of a swindle using counterfeit bonds worth $635 million.  They would be sold to the Vatican Bank, and the money used for payoffs, and buying control of a company.  The bank would write this off as a loss.  You can be sure of high-level corruption and collusion in the bank!  The murder of Pope John Paul I may never be solved officially.

This is his story of his career, including his anecdotes about his American allies. He joined MI5 as a scientist who specialized in tools for espionage. He had been promised credit for his years as a civilian scientist. When this promise was broken at retirement, he wrote this book to even out things.<br />This is an interesting book that can't be summarized in a few paragraphs. It is definitely worth reading for the details on government activities in a \\"democracy\\". Watergate was a notable failure of such activities. Do these activities continue? Of course!<br />Pages 158-9 tell of his proposal for a \\"Bolshevik model\\" for former colonial countries: let a political party control the army and secret police so that neither the army or another political party could gain control of the government. He pointed out that only those newly created countries that adopted this principle have escaped military dictatorships and civil war.<br />Does the above advice seem to cynical and radical? But our Establishment DOES control the army and secret police so that neither the military or a populist political party (one not controlled by corporate interests) can gain control.<br />Yet the classic solution for democracies, from Aristotle to Machiavelli to our Founding Fathers was well-armed citizens and their militia. It has worked well for over over a century, and the idea still survives today.	2002-07-09

This book is about dieting, and a guide to energy, food, fitness, and health. It explains why calorie counting and unbalanced diets do not work, but often lead to fatigue, depression, and malnutrition. Energy expenditure and balanced food intake will allow you to stay thin.<br />Chapter 8 &quot;All you Need To Know&quot; sums up this book in thirty short paragraphs on 6 pages. You can read this first as a quick guide to the rest of this book. It will give you the knowledge to eat wisely. The first ten points tell the effects of dieting on the human body. The next ten points tell why people in Western countries tend to get fat. The last ten points tell how to lose fat and gain health.<br />Following are some interesting quotes from this book. Page 26 notes those insurance company weight tables created during the Great Depression. (Were they ever proven to be valid?) When he added up the calories in the diet books he found their reasoning to be preposterous (p.34). Measurements showed that fat people ate less than thin people (p.35)! So the answer is &quot;metabolism&quot;. After the author started running as a hobby, he lost weight and fat, and could then eat and drink what he wanted (p.43). Activity, not dieting, reduces weight and fat. Dieting causes a loss of glycogen and water, and low blood sugar levels. The result is weakness, depression, irritation, tiredness, and sometimes faintness and dizziness. Dieting is like famine or starvation, and causes involuntary changes (p.50). Dieting slows down metabolism, a fact that makes &quot;most diet books so much waste paper&quot; (p.59). Overfeeding causes a person's metabolic rate to speed up when asleep of at rest (p.62). Your metabolic rate determines whether you'll stay slim, or get fat easily. Activity will change your metabolic rate, exercise will build lean tissue.<br />Eating a lot of sugar is bad because it contains no vitamins or minerals. Its digestion subtracts nutrients from the body. The most nutritious parts of meat (blood and guts) are usually discarded (p.81). Heart disease and obesity become epidemic about twenty years after a population starts to consume more than seventy pounds of sugar a year (p.102). Be aware that many processed foods are high in sugar (Table I, p.115). Pages 127-8 tell of a painless and effortless manner to lose weight: eat four slices of whole wheat bread before each meal. If you want to lose fat and gain health, do not go on a diet and do not eat processed foods, especially sugar (p.129).<br />Some food of animal origin is exceptionally nutritious: fish, game animals and game birds above all. Their flesh is lower in fat, and their fats are high in essential fatty acids (p.15). (Another argument for hunting?) He tells of a study that compared runners to sedentary people; the former were lighter than the latter, yet ate more. &quot;Lose weight, eat more. Gain weight, eat less&quot; (p.175).<br />So what about all those &quot;fast days&quot; promulgated by some religions in the springtime? I think it was an attempt to modify people's metabolisms so as to extend dwindling food supplies. A true &quot;miracle of the loaves and fishes&quot;?	2002-07-08

The title refers to an incident when as an Imperial Policeman in Burma he had to kill a tame elephant that went wild. He describes the times, and his reluctance to kill a working elephant \\"a costly piece of machinery\\". But the people seemed to expect it - for safety, and a huge amount of meat.<br /><br />The next essay tells of his participation in a hanging. He doesn't tell of the offense, only that he was \\"a puny wisp of a man\\". \\"How the Poor Die\\" tells of his hospitalization in 1929 Paris; he had a fever. He saw a doctor perform cupping on a patient! He was treated next, and then was given a mustard poultice. Orwell notes that a natural death means something slow, smelly, and painful. His prior experience was with people who died violent deaths. The public wards of hospitals often have horror, as if certain diseases only attacked lower income people. Later he learned this hospital had a bad reputation.<br /><br />His \\"Thoughts on James Burnham\\" and the organization of society are still fresh and relevant after 50+ years, but outdated in parts. He pointed out that Burnham's prophecies are of \\"a continuation of the thing that is happening\\"; Orwell calls this cowardice and a worship of power. Orwell notes that a poll would have intelligent people guessing wrong, and less knowing people being right! He blames the worship of power for this. You can judge Orwell by this essay.<br /><br />Orwell criticizes the claim \\"sports creates goodwill\\" by pointing to everyday experiences. Only local games played for fun and exercise create no fanaticism. Sport is frankly mimic warfare. It arouses the passion of the spectators to believe a kicked ball tests national virtue! But these actions merely illustrate the emotions hidden in everyday life.<br /><br />In the \\"Decline of the English Murder\\" he points out that sex and money were involved in many famous murders. To get it or to keep it. This is the lesson of Criminology. Raymond Chandler's article \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\" criticized the fiction where murder is committed to provide a mystery to be solved.<br /><br />\\"Reflections on Gandhi\\" gives Orwell's views. He notes that his prevention of violence served the British Empire. The Indian aristocracy and millionaires preferred him to Socialists and Communists. But nobody thought he was corrupt or ambitious. One fault was that he did not seek adequate personal protection in public! Gandhi treated all people with respect. Gandhi's personal philosophy was: no meat-eating, or any form of animal food. No alcohol, tobacco, spices or condiments; no sexual intercourse. No close friendships and no exclusive loves whatever. [I wonder what the point of all this was?] Satyagraha only seems feasible when a Ruling Class is inclined to grant your requests. It is useless against 19th century British (or other) imperialisms. Most people understand this if they can't articulate it. The concept of \\"passive resistance\\" is useful for a Ruling Class that does not want to lose their power, but may ameliorate the conditions of their subjects. Think about it.	2002-06-27

Chapter 1 tells how HEL remembers the 1950s. The election of JFK made a difference due to the people; the times they were a-changing. Pages 43-4 tells of the \\"bureaucratic phenomenon\\" but doesn't ask if any clique or secret society is responsible. Chapter 2 tells of JFK's medical history. He quotes the curious comments of Dr. Humes on the adrenal glands (pp. 55-6). There would be no reason for covering up any Addison's disease. HEL suggests the use of cortisone by JFK affected his personality: euphoria, strength, endurance, warmth, and libido (p.59).<br />Chapter 3 tells certain findings are conclusive: the back of the head is missing (p.71). If the photographs and X-rays don't show this, they are forgeries. Or from another body. HEL derides the theory that \\"the Mob killed Kennedy\\" on the grounds that they couldn't do a cover-up. But their controllers could! Chapter 5 discusses the events at Bethesda. The face in some of the autopsy photographs does not look like JFK, but of a younger man (p.135). Chapter 6 discusses the conflicts of the autopsy. This is one of the most important chapters in the book!<br />Chapter 14 tells of the discussion for a 1991 documentary. \\"The large hole in the back of the head was an exit wound\\" (p.287). These witnesses insisted there was not entry wound in the back of the head (p.293). Chapter 16 quotes the House Committee report that the authenticity of the photographs was never established (p. 314-6). Chapter 19 discusses some other major political killings following the assassination of JFK. HEL notes that if George Wallace ran for President he would have taken enough votes from Nixon so McGovern would have won (p.403). Friends of this lone gunman soon died or disappeared (p.407). More potential witnesses were bumped off when the House Assassination Committee started in 1977 (p.414). Page 418 summarizes the bottom line of American political history.<br />Chapter 20 summarizes the changes in America since the Nixon and Reagan reigns (p.422); it doesn't cover the 1990s. Page 458 claims the Schoolbook Depository rifle was not fired that day (from negative evidence)! Chapter 24 discusses JFK's \\"intent to withdraw from Vietnam\\", while the military sought to send in combat troops. That happened with the new President. Vietnam is important since it borders the oil-rich South China Sea; and Big Oil is the most powerful special interest in the country.<br />Chapter 25 tells of Jim Garrison's investigation. \\"A secret investigation ... pointed in the direction of Hoffa, Marcello, some Texas oilmen, and a few involved with the CIA in the New Orleans and Dallas area\\" (p.511). But Garrison couldn't get a conviction of anyone. David Ferrie, and others, soon died (p.513). Pages 518-9 discuss the justice system: \\"too often a case can be rigged\\". Jim Garrison was the first official to question the Warren Report in the 1960s. Oliver Stones's \\"JFK\\" was based on Garrison's book; he make a popular film about a Presidential assassination - a Hollywood first! It did renew a wider interest in the books on this case.<br />Chapter 28 gives HEL's ideas of \\"What Really Happened\\", and summarizes this case. Watergate and Nixon's removal were caused by Nixon's use of political murders. Page 571 imagines an \\"ice bullet\\" that would disappear; isn't it more likely that a plastic bullet would not show up on X-rays? Pages 573-7 gives HEL's ideas on how the real government works: politicians are like actors on a stage, spouting the lines written by the invisible government. He says \\"our elections are rigged from the<BR>start\\". And that a vast amount of money was made by those who sold short on the morning of 11/22/1963 due to advance information. The Warren Commission and the Administration were from the high-level banking and financial interests that control our nation.	2002-06-26

The ME must detect this thru medical evidence, laboratory findings, the circumstances, and the patient's medical history. These circumstances are used to analyze unnatural deaths - suicide, homicide, and accidents. Forensic pathology is an untaught specialty. Apprentices train in a medical examiner's office, and learn by on the job training. MEs see the failures of society in deaths that need not have happened. Alcohol is involved in almost half of all unnatural deaths. In Europe, forensic pathologists in emergency rooms analyze victims to see what they can learn. This book contains twelve chapters on various topics from his varied experiences. Dr. Baden was a medical ME for 25 years in New York city. His book will also tell you about the politics involved in his work. It tells a lot about his experiences with the justice system.<br />Chapter 1 deals with celebrities, and uses the phrase \\"conspiracy theory\\" to dismiss those who use the facts to question any Official Explanation. Bobby Kennedy was NOT shot by Sirhan, who was 6 feet in the front, but by a gun held less than 3 inches from the right rear of his head. Note the careful wording of his sentence! The same careful wording is used about James Earl Ray and the question of the extent of his guilt. The sly dedication is another example of careful wording.<br />Dr. Baden takes the Warren Report position on the JFK assassination. The experienced trauma doctors at Parkland all said the shots came from the front. But it was not inevitable that conspiracy theories would arise, any more than they did with Lincoln. He says JFK's autopsy was bungled. Some in Europe (who have an older history) said this clumsiness was sanctioned as a way to destroy evidence. The doctor who did it had never performed an autopsy on a gunshot wound; he didn't know the difference between and exit and entry wound. Dr. Milton Helpern later suggested more experienced MEs should havebeen called it. His name was then removed from the list of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (but this was no conspiracy). The Warren Commission did not seek advice from any forensic pathologist, but this was no conspiracy. Finding the \\"magic bullet\\" with no deformities by somebody's stretcher was not a conspiracy either. \\"The result was an autopsy report filled with errors, sins of omission and commission\\" (p.13). But it was no conspiracy! The doctor who did the Bethesda autopsy said \\"the complexities of these fractures and the fragments thus produced tax satisfactory verbal description and are better appreciated in photographs and roentgenograms which are prepared\\" (p.10). Has a doctor avoided a verbal description in any other case? Other books better document the problems of this case.	2002-06-25

The terminus was named “Atlantic City” (p.15). By 1880 Atlantic City was a thriving summer resort. Its Convention Center was built in 1929   the largest unobstructed room in the world (488 feet long, 288 feet wide, 137 feet high). Chapter 2 explains how any political machine must work to be successful: provide gambling, prostitution, alcohol, and drugs 24x7. With police protection for those who pay for it. (This ignores any commercial rivalry or union breaking.) The Depression and changing fashions led to the downfall of this Queen of Resorts.   Did corruption and crime kill Atlantic City? Can any resort area outlive changing fashions? Chapter 5 points to Newark. With its seaport, airport, and train station, New York close by, it should be NJ’s best city, not a national example of urban decay. Does this reflect the policies of the state’s Ruling Class? Chapter 8 tells of the politics in passing a referendum to allow gambling in Atlantic City. It names the politicians and fixers behind this deal. Does NJ have the reputation as the most corrupt in the nation? It was run in turn by large landowners, railroads, insurance companies, and big banks (p.62). Could this be due to its powerful state government and the relative lack of democratic power of the people?   Part II tell “The Way It Is” and covers the decade after the Casino Control Act was passed. It has all the big names in Jersey politics, and the squalid scandals. Read it for all the stories on corruption that they will never teach you in school. Since the book ends in 1985 it doesn’t cover the effects of the other casinos across the country, or in nearby Connecticut. Too many casinos chasing fewer gamblers? This and changing fashions could mean another decline for Atlantic City. Or maybe not, it they can change with the times. Pages 204 5 tellhow Bally moved from pinball machines into video games, and opened “family amusement centers” in shopping malls, and acquired theme parks, health clubs, and the biggest supplier of lottery tickets in the nation.   After gambling was legalized, property taxes, water, sewer, and utility bills increased by 200 300%; street crimes, prostitution, and drug abuse went up 500% (pp. 367 8). Ninety percent of the businesses operating in 1976 were gone by 1985 (p.378). So who really profited? Chapter 31 gives “The Bottom Line” and summarizes the effects of legalized gambling. Where it once had 30,000 rooms and was a family vacation resort now has a fraction of that in first class hotel rooms. Las Vegas has far more (but this may reflect travel times). “Gambling is a parasitic enterprise that thrives on the weaknesses of people. It leaves in its wake corruption, debasement, despair, and the subversion of moral authority. That is the real bottom line” (p.424). Ovid Demaris is a journalist who covers similar topics of corruption.	2002-06-25
1526655:US	38002140	R33HNE4WZ190BX	0393315444	263889250	Fatal Justice: Reinvestigating the MacDonald Murders	Books	5	16	36	N	N	Actual Innocence	Fatal Justice   Jerry Allen Potter is a novelist and non-fiction writer. Fred Bost is an ex-Army and Pentagon investigator; he won two awards for investigative journalism. Jeffrey MacDonald was convicted of the murder of his wife and two young daughters. The book “Fatal Vision” accused MacDonald of the murders, a TV miniseries convinced people of his guilt. This book of 463 pages used the government’s lab notes and other documents acquired by the Freedom of Information Act to argue for a wrongful conviction. This evidence shows that a group of strangers committed the murders in February 1970. I first learned about this case by watching the TV miniseries which made MacDonald look guilty. Was this story “too good to be true”? Being older and wiser I know enough not to believe fictions on TV and in the newspapers.   Chapter 13 explains the faults in the Appeals to this case. This is an even bigger problem than the wrongful conviction of one man. What can be done to correct the US Supreme Court? [An age limit of 70 and an expansion in the number of Justices seems like one solution.] Due-process rights are fundamental to simple political freedom against a government that can lie and plant false evidence against anyone they want to get. But Nixon, Reagan, and Bush appointed Justices who eliminated some procedural rights. Rehnquist’s decision made it very difficult to get a second appeal hearing (p.362). This is an example where the Supreme Court made a basic change in the law (p.364).If new evidence showed ‘actual innocence’ that would not allow a new appeal! Evidence of innocence was discarded (p.376). Because the government prosecutors hid exculpatory evidence the defense could not use it after an earlier appeal (p.392)! Many members of the prosecution were later found guilty of misdeeds (‘Epilogue’). The lies of the prosecution are summarized on page 397.   ‘Part One’ has the Army Investigation. In the early morning of February 17, 1970 Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald’s family was attacked, his wife and children killed (Chapter 1). But the government prosecutors framed MacDonald for the murders. Many say MacDonald was innocent (p.19). Three people confessed to being at the murders (p.33). Was the trial fixed (p.34)? Potter called Fred Bost to get information (Chapter 2). If the evidence collection was faulty then the evidence cannot be trusted (p.42). The following pages notes the faults (pp.52-61). Chapter 3 tells about the drugs and crime in Fayetteville. The Army CID targetted MacDonald in spite of the evidence (Chapter 4). The Army investigation recommended the charges be dropped. MacDonald asked for an honorable hardship discharge. Then he worked at the emergency department of St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach California. Charges were made against the Army CID; this was squashed (Chapter 5).    The government used many tricks against MacDonald and ignored the likely criminals. The defense was not allowed to test the evidence! Chapter 6 tells about the trial. The judge was biased (pp.138-139). The other pages are very important for the details. A private detective found evidence hidden by the government (p.147)! Psychiatric tests found no problems (Chapter 8). That doctor’s experiments on people reminds me of some Nazi war crimes (p.208)! Is that report an example of ‘psycho babble’ (p.214)? MacDonald was hypnotized to remember the murders (p.215). [I wonder if anyone was profiting from drug dealing and framed MacDonald to distract people from the real criminals?] Chapter 9 tells of “The Verdict”. MacDonald’s wounds were defensive (p.223). The prosecutor lied about the black wool fibers (p.235). With the hidden evidence MacDonald was convicted and given three life term.   ‘Part Three’ tells what happened. Two of the jurors at first refused to convict, but went along with the others (Chapter 10). Helena Stoeckley told about the murders when interviewed (p.250). She was found dead on January14, 1983, no sign of foul play (p.259). It has the confession of Greg Mitchell (p.261) and Cathy Perry (p.265). MacDonald’s description of the attackers matched a group of drug users (p.270). The flow of drugs into Fort Bragg suggested a high-placed official was dirty (Chapter 11). Some say this is why the CID framed MacDonald (p.277). It is illegal for the Army to prosecute someone who is now a civilian (p.278). Was the judge prejudiced (p.298)? His son-in-law was a prosecutor. He did not recuse himself (p.304). Dupree favored the prosecution (pp.307-309). The exculpatory information had been withheld (p.314)!   Joe McGinniss wrote the book “Fatal Vision” which blamed MacDonald for the murders (Chapter 12). [How many knew this was a biased story?] Were they wrong to trust McGinniss (p.318)? The “Sixty Minutes” interview used McGinniss’ claims, which were false (p.324). [This show is entertainment, it does not follow the rules for news shows.] MacDonald’s lawyer called it a “horrible lie” (pp.325-327). McGinniss said one thing to MacDonald and the opposite to his editor (p.339). McGinniss was caught in misquotes (p.344). Did he invent a story (p.346)? Lying to a subject is “unacceptable ... and unprofessional” (p.350). McGinniss paid $325,000 to settle out of court (p.352). Did McGinniss believe his own theory? No (p.355). ‘Part Four’ discusses the Appeal. Since 1990 the Supreme Court attacked traditional rights (p.361). The Rehnquist Court limited the right for a second appeal (p.362). [Isn’t this evidence of their senility? Its no wonder people want to abolish capital punishment!]   The rest of the chapter tells of their attempt to get an appeal for a second and more honest trial. The Fourth Circuit judges turned down the appeal, following the Supreme Court’s novel ruling (p.383). This “rewards state misconduct and deceit” (p.384). Can Congress write a decent “habeas corpus” law to allow appeals when the government failed to disclose evidence to the defense (p.388)? The following pages summarize the problems with the evidence. The ‘Epilogue’ tells of the misdeeds of the prosecution team. In 1993 President Clinton promised ethics reform in government (p.395). Janet Reno ordered the release of Freedom on Information Act information. How did that work out? Why was there a cover-up (p.397)? Four possible motives are suggested.	2002-05-30

Those who would work for any similar change may learn something from his story. From 1942 to 1991 about 25% of the Federal Defense budget was spent in California. This created a growing economy, even if it drained funds from the northeast states.<br />Since 1945 land prices and property taxes were booming in California. After his 1962 retirement, HJ began his involvement with the United Organization of Taxpayers. [A movement needs a cadre of dedicated workers.] It then affiliated with other organizations, and thousands of volunteers from all over the state. [The movement must be represented in all counties.] It is very important to have unity and loyalty to the group. [Fragmentation, petty quarrels, and demoralization should be avoided.] They experienced many defeats. [Expect to lose many battles before final victory.] Proposition 13 cut property taxes in half (p.9)! This set an example for the other states (p.10). It could never have been achieved without the Initiative & Referendum law in Calif. But an organization can pass around a petition and get tens of thousands of signatures. Even if it has no legal effect it will impress and scare elected officials. Calif. passed an initiative and referendum law in 1911, an extension to the right of petition. This allows the people to write a law and bypass corrupt state politicians. Without the right to petition, Proposition 13 would not have been passed.<br />Chapters One thru Seven tell of the work by this movement. 64,000 tax-exempt corporations and 18,000 charitable trusts paid no property taxes. Most of them were set up to get a tax break! Towns would raise assessments one year, then the tax rate the next (p.28). The enormous increases in property taxes priced young couples out of the market. And older people had lowered incomes.<br />Chapter 8 is his autobiography. He was born and raisedin Utah. His father was a carpenter who studied law and became a judge. HJ studied law at the University of Utah by day and worked at a mill by night. He taught boxing in college, and fought as a professional. HJ also played semipro baseball for a copper mill (p.209). He had a varied and interesting life as a newspaper publisher, and then as a manufacturer. Pages 256-7 tell of his legal experiences with the patent on radio push-button tuning; they lost out to big corporations due to high level political decisions. He was part of the group that ran an ad for a Congressional candidate - they decided on \\"the guy in the sailor suit\\" (p.263).<br />Chapter Nine lists his political ideas. He advocates elimination all property taxes, and using income taxes (ability to pay), sales taxes (with some exemptions), and \\"other forms of taxes\\". HJ would encourage more public participation in the public business of government. He recommends limiting the size of government to limit the power of politicians. Public schools should be overhauled to create a better product. HJ wants more personal savings to replace the Social Security system. He also wants the US to have the most powerful military in the world, but doesn't want foreign entanglements.	2002-05-21

After three decades at CBS Bernard Goldberg discovered this fact also applies to media workers! The corporate lifeblood of advertising depends on telling people what to think and buy. What insider can question this? Corporate workers know what policies and viewpoints will help you get ahead, even if you do not have a relative in upper management. Its not just dressing for success, but politically correct thinking.<br />BG says \\"the networks tilt left\\" (p.2) but provides no proof. Are they advocating a Canadian-style health care system? Are they seeking to nationalize the military-industrial complex, or end corporate controlled agriculture? Are they asking for higher income tax rates? Or are they merely presenting \\"feel good\\" news to sedate their viewers? Hollywood knows their audiences favor a happy ending; why shouldn't there be \\"happy news\\"? <br />BG writes \\"network news ... steals just about everything from print\\" (p.25). So they merely echo the news from Establishment leaders like the 'New York Times' or 'Washington Post'. He doesn't tell who controls these newspapers; he sees the trees but not the forest.<br />Page 32 quotes Dan Rather: \\"you just try to tell me how to report the news\\". Don't his managers do that every day? Can Dan ever deviate from reading his script on TV? (I once was him apologize to the TV camera when he stumbled over the script he had to recite.) And Dan never uses his Texan accent either!<br />Corporate broadcasts of the news use it as a vehicle for advertising. It must be that a \\"liberal bias\\" sells, and other styles don't; the bottom line commands attention. Nothing in this book denies that \\"liberal bias\\" reflects the policies of their corporate owners. <br />\\"The first step in controlling a communicable disease is to determine who is getting it and how\\" (p.89). Do people catch \\"liberal bias\\" by living in small rural towns? Do they catch it from working in urban financial centers like New York, San Francisco, or Atlanta? Do they get it from studies in college? BG needs to document this disorder better. If journalists are more \\"liberal\\" than the general public could it be a type of industrial disease? They do learn more about what's happening, and how the news is censored; it could make them more cynical.<br />Chapter 11 has an important and under-reported story: the decline of \\"child well-being\\". Does the absence of parents result in poor learning, drug abuse, and other evils? Do corporations profit from working mothers, convenient fast-foods, and remedial schooling? Does the media profit from their advertising? BG says this failure to report is caused by laziness (p.167), but the real answer may be that it would reduce the profits of their advertisers.<br />Page 172 says that children in day care tend to be more aggressive and defiant: argue a lot, demand a lot of attention, act cruelly, slow explosive behavior, talk too much, and get into a lot of fights. (Is this Pavlovian conditioning?) The increasing number of children in early day care exactly coincides with the epidemic of childhood asthma (p.176). The news that day care results in more respiratory tract infections was censored from the newspapers (p.177). BG doesn't ask if this is due to advertisers, he just says the \\"media elites\\" kept it hidden!	2002-05-20

HRH was not a lawyer or politician; he was in advertising when he first became a volunteer for Nixon in 1956 (p.49). HRH was not alarmed by the Watergate break-in. Nixon used wiretapping in his first term, and it was also used by LBJ and JFK; it was widespread in business (p.5). HRH blames Watergate on John Mitchell's neglect of his duties at CRP (p.10), which left Magruder in charge. Nixon told HRH it was &#34;unimportant&#34;, when in reality Nixon blew up in a towering rage; HRH was being deceived by Nixon (p.13)!   HRH sealed Nixon's doom by meeting him on June 23, 1972 to discuss getting the CIA to stop the FBI's search into CRP money. Tell the CIA &#34;this will open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again&#34;, said Nixon. Helms and Walter denied any CIA connection with Watergate (p.34). But at least one of the burglars was still on the CIA payroll, and was reporting about the proposed break-in even before it happened; the first lawyer for the burglars was reportedly CIA-connected.   When the CIA at first refused to tell the FBI to back off, HRH played Nixon's trump: &#34;this entire affair may be connected to the Bay of Pigs&#34;. Turmoil followed; HRH was absolutely shocked by Helms' violent reaction. And so the CIA asked the FBI to not investigate the Mexican bank and the CRP money. Years later the mystery of the &#34;Bay of Pigs&#34; connection was cleared up by reading Daniel Schorr's &#34;Clearing the Air&#34;; it was a code word for the assassination of JFK (pp. 37-39).   HRH said he protected Nixon by not following &#34;petty vindictive orders&#34; (p.58). But Charles Colson encouraged Nixon's dark impulses, and acted on them. Pages 62-64 tell that the associates who confronted Nixon's &#34;dark&#34; side would not survive on the job. HRH then says he was sorry he did not try to positively restrain the dark side of Nixon. &#34;The Mysteries of theCover-Up&#34; explains how their &#34;containment&#34; created a &#34;cover-up&#34; that the courts called &#34;conspiracy to obstruct justice&#34; (pp. 216-218). In retrospect, there were many indications along the way that could have caused him to wonder what was really going on. His responsibility was the  operation of the office of the President; he chose not to know anything else at the time.   &#34;The Hidden Story of Watergate&#34; mentioned that Nixon planned a reorganization of the government that aimed to give him unprecedented control.

His job is to establish the \\"manner, cause and circumstance\\" of death and to report the findings to the public. Every death is a mystery until the cause is known. A coroner is specifically trained to solve that mystery. He collects evidence, interviews witnesses, oversees the autopsy and laboratory reports on the body. In any unusual death, the first duty of an ME is to suspect murder, until proven otherwise.<br />At age 13 Dr. Noguchi witnessed an incident with his father's patient that set him on the road to forensic medicine. He later learned medicine by day and law by night. After graduation he left for America, the world leader in technology. He aimed to practice forensic medicine because of his love for scientific detective work.<br />Chapter 4 tells of the autopsy of Robert F. Kennedy. One shot entered underneath the right armpit and exited the right front shoulder. Another was under the armpit and traversed sideways to the spinal column. The fatal bullet entered the skull an inch behind his right ear. The thoroughness of the tests gave credence to a conspiracy theory: Sirhan had NOT fired the fatal bullet (p.101)! The murderer fired from the back into RFK's head; the gun was 3 inches from the head, 1 inch from the right ear. Sirhan was firing from the front (p.103). His gun contained eight bullets, twelve bullet tracks were found at the scene. They could not prove the fatal bullet was fired from Sirhan's gun.<br />Chapter 5 tells of his fights in the jungle of bureaucratic politics and personalities. \\"Noguchi was a target because of plain, old-fashioned prejudices\\" (p.113). The secretary who testified against him admitted her information came from newspapers and the prosecutor! Dr. Noguchi's private comments were the \\"graveyard humor\\" common to pathologists. The chief prosecution witness who tried to fire him as \\"emotionally disturbed\\" admitted he offered him a post a county hospital with live patients! Dr. Noguchi's faults were being an extrovert, having a sense of humor, and excessive ambition in expanding his department.<br />Chapter 11 \\"Forensic Science at Work\\" summarizes many interesting and entertaining stories from his career. He says Proposition 13 made it almost impossible to obtain increased funding for an increased work load.<br />Dr. Noguchi reveals the tragic facts of Natalie Wood's drowning. You can read about Marilyn Monroe, Sharon Tate, Janis Joplin, William Holden, and John Belushi. He tells of \\"the terrible danger of alcohol ... the most popular and most deadly drug ever conceived\\"; one out of every four deaths is alcohol related (p.227).<br />Chapter 14 tells of his demotion and removal as Coroner. He had just been installed as president of the National Association of Medical Examiners in Nov 1982. The investigator had ruled that Dr. Noguchi had been \\"unjustifiably demoted\\", but the Civil Service Commission disregarded this ruling. He was the victim of bureaucratic harassment or some kind of personal vendetta.	2002-05-06

It emphasizes the part played by Dr. Samuel A. Mudd \\"a co-conspirator of John Wilkes Booth both before and after Booth's murder of Lincoln\\" (p.3). High-ranking officials of the Confederate Secret Service supported John Wilkes Booth during the war; the assassination seemed to be Booth's idea.<br />In 1864 Union troops planned a surprise raid on Richmond to destroy the city, free captured prisoners, and kill Jeff Davis and the Cabinet (p.4); the leader was killed and his notes captured. The Confederate Secret Service then planned to copy this scheme by capturing Lincoln as a hostage. They knew Lincoln often rode alone in secret to his summer residence (the \\"Soldiers Home\\"), and could be easily be taken by surprise.<br />Lincoln first tried to emancipate the slaves by compensating slave owners in the border states (p.39); it was refused. Later that year he issued the Emancipation Proclamation. The reunited Union would no longer allow slavery (or peonage). The Southern reaction to Black soldiers was to kill all they captured; they understood the threat of armed slaves. Lincoln's \\"Order of Retaliation\\" ordered reprisals against captured rebel soldiers in return.<br />The book mentions Booth's hatred of Negroes, hired laborers, European immigrants, etc. Could this have been in compensation for his own illegitimate birth?<br />John Wilkes Booth's profession and fame allowed him to move about freely and with less suspicion. His fame and personality made him attractive so people would do him favors (p.58). This made him an effective agent for the Confederacy. Booth was a \\"bright and personable character who was admired by nearly everyone who knew him\\" (p.85). But being well-known also meant he was quickly identified as the assassin.<br />Lincoln was given the Episcopal burial service, although Lincon \\"was not a member of any religious denomination and had not been baptized into theChristian faith\\" (p.273). The picture of Lincoln on the dust cover shows vertical strabismus; his left eye turned upwards (see the current $5 bill). I wonder what medical condition caused this?	2002-04-30

Christopher Hitchens' dislike of William Clinton seems due to his assumption of a \\"Liberal Democrat\\" for what is really a very successful chameleon of a politician. He wrote a book on Kissinger, but doesn't mention if Clinton is another flunky of the Rockefellers. What else can explain his rise from a virtual log cabin to the White House?<br />Pages 18-19 tell of an attempt to induce campaign contributions from the Cheyenne-Arapaho peoples of Oklahoma. We only heard of this nasty deal because it was rejected. Hitches doesn't mention if they ever did get their swindled land back; what happened since then? Hitchens' bias is shown by calling Bobby Kennedy and Edwin Meese \\"sordid underlings\\" (p.19-20). He doesn't give any facts to support this allegation. Surely its not due to any political decisions? He also call \\"Clintonoid propaganda\\" the phrase \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\". Surely there was a \\"right-wing conspiracy\\" against Clinton, like some other Presidents. And it did come close to success.<br />People talked about Monica's mother, who lived in the apartment next to Sen. Bob Dole (Viagara Spokesman!). Surely this implies something? Monica's step-father donated money to get Monica a job close to President Bill; his advertising agency's biggest customer was Big Tobacco, which was not a Friend of Bill. Was there a plot to use Monica's habit? Was any foreign intelligence involved here? The resulting scandal appears to me as a failed blackmail attempt. Was Clinton the first of last politician to enjoy \\"female companionship\\" as a tax-free perquisite of office? Remember Wilbur Mills?<br />Page 32 mentions a telephone call from a Florida sugar-grower. Didn't FDR also develop policies for Cuban sugar at the request of New York financial circles? He also mentions how this family supports both major political parties; is this something new or unique to Florida? Pages 34-35 tell about polling, and how it is used to fool the people. \\"The Quiet Canadian\\" told how this then military secret was developed during WW II to control thinking. Orwell's \\"1948\\" was a fictionalized version of 1948 England and the world. Perhaps this would be a better subject for his next book.<br />Chapter Three reminds us that the four largest insurance companies helped finance and design the Clinton's health-care plan. A \\"Canadian-style\\" system would provide comprehensive coverage, and the most cost-effective effort. I guess that's why Hillary became Senator after JFK Jr. was removed as a potential candidate (see 'Flying' magazine from October 2000).<br />Pages 71-72 tell of the resurrected 1969 draft board letter. Could it really have been so far-sighted? Or could it be a pre-dated composition of political engineering? Was the elected Clinton \\"supporting exorbitant weapons-building projects\\" a pay-off for this act (p.74). Clinton is a younger version of Ronald Reagan: a smiley-faced governor who can win elections, and collects on that skill.	2002-04-25

The \\"Introduction\\" provides a snapshot of that era, and there is a great selection of photographs. The advantage of the Jersey Shore was not just the cool sea breezes; it was a haven from hay-fever, and the noxious smells of the city.<br />Page 4 tells of the attack on Charles VanSant, who went into the sea with a dog. The signs say \\"No Dogs on the Beach\\" because swimming dogs attract sharks! Academic experts considered such shark attacks as impossible in these waters. Resort owners talked down any fears of more attacks, which caused lost business. Then attacks in Matawan creek created a bigger sensation. People bought dynamite from hardware stores and threw it into the creek to kill the shark. People were warned against swimming near inlets of deep channels.<br />Page 98 quotes statistics that minimize the chance of a shark attack: only 5 to 10 deaths each year. But another book pointed out that newspapers are more likely to report \\"injured while swimming\\" than a \\"shark attack\\". I remember the event in the summer of 1949 near Asbury Park when a young man was \\"injured while swimming\\" (no mention of a shark); he died a few days later.<br />They are called \\"man eaters\\" because Caucasian males aged 15 to 24 years account for the vast majority of victims (p.101). This also correlates to drowning deaths. Warm-blooded sharks tend to feed on calorie-rich fatty seals and whales; humans are nutrition-poor (p.116).<br />1916 was the first year that sewage was piped into the coastal waters off NJ. This could feed small creatures, and the larger ones higher on the food chain. Fishermen disposed of fish parts close to shore; \\"chumming\\" is known to attract predators. Heavy rains could also wash out food for sea creatures. This may be one reason why shore resorts use holding tanks during the tourist season.<br />Since the Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed in 1972, the number of marine mammals has increased inCalifornia, along with white shark attacks (p.262). An example of \\"unintended consequences\\"?<br />How would the press deal with a shark attack? Since the loss of tourists means a loss of advertising revenue, any bad news could be censored. They could print articles about spotting dolphins off the beach - proof that no sharks were around (p.270). A classic example of thought-control: people would see what they were told to expect.<br />Science does not believe in the \\"rogue shark\\" theory, altho rogues occur with lions, tigers, and elephants. This behavior may be caused by an ailment. The last chapter explains why the great white shark caught off South Amboy was responsible for the attacks in Matawan creek and elsewhere.	2002-04-15

This book tells of his investigation into the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. \\"The truth of the King assassination is that it was a much more sophisticated conspiracy executed by persons possessing the kind of expertise generally found within intelligence circles.\\"<br />Chapter 2 discusses the coincidences in the life of the two Canadians whose names were used by James Earl Ray: they both traveled to the US in the 1960s, and both resembled Ray. This allowed Ray to obtain a legal (if false) passport rather than a forgery. Chapter 7 tells of his discovery of the \\"fat man\\" who delivered a letter to Ray; hours later Ray picked up and paid for his flight to London. There was \\"big money\\" behind Ray (p.60). Years later this \\"fat man\\" was still afraid for his personal safety (p.61). Chapter 9 discusses the problems with the evidence against Ray. Only one spent cartridge was in the rifle; no other cartridges were in the rifle. The cartridge had no fingerprints on it!<br />Chapter 10 attempts a systematic and logical reconstruction of Ray's time and actions. Did Ray use his binoculars to spy on King and then go to the communal bathroom? Did he spend time in a communal bathroom shared by the 13 tenants? There are problems with either scenario. Why would an experienced criminal like Ray leave his fingerprints on the rifle? \\"The best evidence suggests that Ray was an unexceptional criminal who had exceptionally clever help\\" (p.125). <br />Chapter 12 notes that Ray had plastic surgery on his nose in 1968; it made him appear more like Eric Galt. Eric Galt's activities and travel would make him suspicious (p.139). Ray had a flawless performance as a fugitive - until he flew to Europe (and was now on his own). Chapter 13 tells of Melanson's interview with Ray in 1984. Ray claimed to have been set up as a fall guy by the conspirators (p.153). Ray probably does not know the identities of the conspirators anyway, only the go-betweens. So the truth about this tragic assassination remains shrouded in official secrecy.<br />Where was James Earl Ray when Kennedy was shot? The first shot that hit JFK was in the throat. Did it narrowly miss being a fatal shot like the one that killed M L King? There is a difference between using a rifle or a piston in an assassination. A fanatic may use a pistol, and be quickly caught or killed. A professional will use a rifle so he can make his escape before being located, and collect his reward (except when using a piston allows this escape).	2002-04-02

The details follow the very real assassination of JFK. Was this published too soon after the event? The House Select Committee later brought out many facts used by this novel, which explains the assassination as the revenge of organized crime. But it doesn't explain why the ruling circles covered up the assassination. Haven't corporate powers used organized crime to perform those actions which can't be done by lawyers and accountants?    One person in this book is \\"Lola Camonte\\", an international hostess and Washington lobbyist and fixer. Could this be a reference to the famous widow of a Governor? \\"President Kegan\\" asks her about appointing a member of organized crime to the Court of St. James. This could never happen in real life, could it? This book explains how the media is used to portray fiction as fact. (Remember how President Carter was cut off the air when he began to speak about the assassination of JFK in March 1977?)    When the assassination is planned, they order an independent team as back-up. Since the back-up team was not used they are quickly eliminated as potential witnesses. Many innocent bystanders, who saw more than they needed to know, are also eliminated. But this would never happen in read life, would it?	2002-03-26

Kennedy	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Look and See for Yourself	Best Evidence<br /><br />The author notes that what you believe happened in Dallas on 11-22-1963 depends on what evidence you believe. (Or what evidence you've been told to believe.) In courtrooms, juries are presented with conflicting evidence; they decide which evidence is credible. This is called the &#34;best evidence&#34;; the jury decides the facts.<br /><br />One question on the assassination is the discrepancy between the wounds recorded in Dallas (shots from the front), and the wounds recorded in Washington DC (shots from the rear). Lifton's book says &#34;surgery to the head&#34; occurred to change the evidence. But this would have to be quickly and expertly done. A simpler solution would be the use of a &#34;body double&#34;, a replacement for the body of JFK that could be quickly switched. This would explain why the body in Washington was in a body bag while the body in Dallas was in a casket. Doing this is the final proof of a conspiracy and cover-up.<br /><br />There is another way to test this theory. Some books contain the Washington DC autopsy photos. The pictures of the President show a thick faced JFK who looks like other 45-year olds. The face of the body in the autopsy appears about 30 years old, in my opinion. Look and see for yourself. If you agree, this proves a conspiracy in killing JFK. As others have pointed out, while one &#34;lone gunman&#34; can kill anyone, it takes a group of conspirators to cover it up for decades. [The blueprint for switching bodies is the 1938 film &#34;The Lady Vanishes&#34; which was often shown on broadcast TV in the late 1950s. It is also done in the movie &#34;Dave&#34;.]<br /><br />There is today an article on Wikipedia on how the ARRB agrees with Lifton's research into the differences seen on the body in Dallas and the body in Bethesda.<br /><br />Why is Oswald &#34;not guilty&#34;? He was never convicted or even indicted! Why was he rubbed out two days later? To prevent him from proving his innocence! Lunchtime is usually around noon. Oswald went to lunch at noon and washed down his meal with a bottle of soda from a machine when that policeman came by. Alive, he could have named the other people who were also in the lunchroom at that time (and they could have confirmed his alibi). Then the conspiracy would be obvious. Being in the second floor lunchroom solves the problem of hiding that rifle then running down four flights of stairs. Yes, this is my assumption, but it best explains the problem of Oswald's movements from the sixth to the second floor.<br /><br />Another argument for Oswald's innocence is his denial of shooting the President. The killers of Presidents in the 19th century all boasted of their deed. So too those in the 20th century who attempted and failed. All used a pistol. Was Oswald lying about this? George O'Toole's book &#34;The Assassination Tapes&#34; explains why Oswald was telling the truth (or was crazy). The idea of a conspiracy also explains the differences in wounds seen in Parkland Hospital and those on the body in Bethesda. I think the conspirators simply sacrificed JFK's double to create a body whose wounds would fit the &#34;lone gunman&#34; theory. Why did the Establishment bump him off? JFK's use of drugs affected his judgment and risked a Nuclear War in October 1962. The book &#34;Dr. Feelgood&#34; explains JFK's health problems. Doesn't this theory best fit the known facts?	2002-03-18

Lizzie Borden: The Legend, the Truth, the Final Chapter, by Arnold R. Brown    Arnold R. Brown was a native of Fall River and retired as an automotive manager to Florida. He met the son-in-law of Henry Hawthorne, whose memoir of the Borden Murders was based on Hawthorne's personal knowledge together with the information from his mother-in-law Ellan Eagan (she walked by the house that day). Brown investigated this case for two years and completed his solution to the crime. This account fits the facts of the case better than any other theory. Read other books and compare for yourself. A secret will not remain secret if it is written. There can be no \\"documentary proof\\" once all involved in the secret have died. You can only infer the secret from the known circumstances.     This solution implies why some said Bridget Sullivan was paid to leave the country: she knew too much (but didn't know it). Bridget may have seen William Borden visiting. She didn't know that he worked as a butcher, was skilled with a hatchet, had a violent temper, and spent time in a mental hospital. Brown says he was more than just a cousin. Bridget's testimony was not favorable to Lizzie, so there was no bribery or collusion here.     Brown discussed the actions of the local ruling class and the politicians who do their bidding. The spontaneous halt in working, a virtual general strike, had to be ended. There were no labor leaders to be shot or jailed. There was a great need to resume production. Somebody had to be arrested for the crime to quell the restless people. Lizzie was arrested to try to break her so she would talk; it didn't work. Lizzie kept the secret. Brown says that such official corruption is always possible when the price and conditions are right. You can review your own local politics and judge for yourself.     Brown's solution to the murders was a visitor whose identity was kept secret from the public. There was a hitch to the cover-up when the Grand Jury indicted Lizzie, so efforts were made to fix the result of the trial for a not guilty verdict. This visitor carried away the murder weapon so none was found There were no blood spatters were on Lizzie (or Bridget). This shielded the Borden family from a scandal. Yet the fickle opinion of the public soon switched from support of Lizzie to condemnation (perhaps the result of envy towards the rich). People realized Lizzie must have known more than she claimed. Brown surmises this secret meeting was over Andrew's will. I think a more likely reason was over a loan that couldn't be repaid on time. Andrew had a long history of foreclosing for debts secured by the borrower's property. What would have happened if Lizzie told the truth about the visitor? Perhaps popular sympathy would be with the victim of a \\"loathsome miser\\" who swindled people out of their property?     Here are the proofs for this conclusion. No bloody clothes or weapon were found because the murders were done by a visitor who left secretly and whose identity was never publicly known. Shielding this person was acceptable to the ruling elite of Fall River, the trial was fixed for the not guilty verdict. This secret was never revealed by those who knew the secret. Why did Lizzie keep the secret? To prevent the seeming greater evil of revealing the purpose of the visit. Andrew Borden lent money and foreclosed on the property of his debtors. If he was about to do this to a nephew who was lured into a loan, the knowledge of this swindle could create a scandal with wide implications. Lizzie kept the secret, and the Silent Government went along. Emma (who controlled the estate) and Uncle John must have played a part in this deal.   \\"It was Farmer William with the Hatchet in the Bedroom and the Sitting Room.\\"	2002-03-15

Was this a campaign promise, or a conscious lie? This is the true confession of an insider on the Reagan team. It seems that cutting taxes was the easy part, it just required passing a popular law. Spending created benefits for groups who will object to any reduction. Machiavelli noted that any changed law is difficult because those who benefit from the old way are united in objection, but those who would benefit from the new way have not experienced the proposed benefits.<br />Stockman says \\"poverty programs\\" could not be reduced, and blames it on politicians like Bob Dole and George McGovern (p.410). Don't they represent food producing area whose products can be bought with food stamps? Don't the grocery chains profit from these sales? Don't other chain stores profit from any money not spent on food? Stockman only looked at one part of this system, and used his prejudgment to condemn this part. He did not understand the working of the system.<br />The book tells of the results of the \\"Atlantic\\" article on Washington. Stockman seemed surprised that his rivals and political enemies ganged up on him (p.6)! He also seemed surprised that those with opposing politics could misquote him! (It does show how the press can be controlled to target a politician.) Senator Lowell Weicker described Stockman this way: \\"He's had his head up his ... from day one\\" (p.389). This books supports that opinion; why else would he write a very readable book about his mistakes?<br />Pages 10-11 tell about \\"an inflation-swollen economy\\". But he dances around the control of the money supply by a Private Banking Cartel (pp.62-3), an important subject. Stockman blames \\"politicians\\" for debasement of the currency, but ignores the fact of who controls the politicians! If Corporate Capitalists control politicians, then they must be the ones who benefit from controlled inflation. The topic of the\\"gold standard\\" masks the fact that silver has been used for money for countless centuries, right down to 1964 in America (remember silver dimes?). Weicker's location of Stockman's head rings true here.<br />Reagan's picked biographer said he was senile by his second term, and may have been in his first. Page 10 supports this opinion. What does this say about our political system? Has anything like this happened since a dead El Cid was tied to a horse?<br />Stockman's \\"revolution\\" required redefining fairness (p.11). It meant an absolute limit on Social Security payouts. Everyone working pays into Social Security, but the benefits are skewed towards longevity (which may omit the oppressed and exploited classes). Cui bono?<br />Page 41 lists the economic problems of the 1970s: speculation over production (the rewards of capital gains over income), and inflation (devaluation of the dollar). Stabilizing the dollar (a silver standard), and higher marginal tax rates appear to be the correct and untried cure. The Chrysler Corporation bail-out resulted from the Rockefeller-controlled forced borrowing; this is censored here (p.42). Dumping Rockefeller's bankers and putting UAW representatives on Chrysler's board did save it for the next twenty years.	2002-03-04

The subject of this book is “The Battle over Gun Control”. This book explains why criminals will always have guns; why armed citizens reduce crime, and do not increase murders; and why gun prohibition would increase crime and create major new criminal activity. The history of “gun control” goes back thousands of years, long before guns were invented. Kings and the aristocracy have always tried to limit popular access to weapons in order to oppress the common people. The one exception is arming the people to avoid defeat by a foreign power; afterwards they are quickly disarmed.   Page 13 explains why the American militia differed from the English: all the men would be armed, and they elected their officers. Indian wars went on for 400 years, and there were wars with the French, Spanish, and Dutch empires. Hunting game was part of everyday life in America; game belonged to everyone. As noted in Aristotle’s ‘Politics’, armed citizens led to popular government in the colonies. The Second Amendment, like the English Bill of Rights, rejected the idea of a collective right in favor of an individual right (p.32). Whenever the right of the people to keep and bear arms is prohibited, liberty is on the brink of destruction.   The book discusses many topics. Page 107 exposes the subtle lies put into the “Brady II” bill. By requiring a minimum weight for a pistol, and then restricting the number of cartridges in a magazine, it would outlaw almost all handguns! Page 111 tells how the Morton Grove ban on handguns originated as a way to keep out competition to an existing store. Page 118 tells how crime sky rocketed after passage of the 1968 Gun Control Act. Guns are more common than swimming pools, but more drown in swimming pools than die in gun accidents (p.120). “The Politics of Scaring the Public” (p.125) points out that TV news is always showing victims on TV, while most viewers may have never seen as much as a fistfight for years! The number of crime shows on TV may have resulted in the public’s perception (not reality!) of polls reporting crime as the most important problem   or the feeling that there’s too many lawyers!   What is the true effect of “gun control”? The worst homicide rates tend to be among the cities and states with the most restrictive laws; the states with no or few gun laws (SD, VT) are the safest. But this reflects population density in rural area. The hidden agenda of the Gun Prohibitionists is to create more crime and violence in order to create a more oppressive society. Instead of a Reichstag fire, imagine a jumbo jet crashing into a Washington building? Prior to 1977 Canada had almost no “gun control”, and much lower homicide rate. After they severely restricted pistols, the Canadian homicide rate grew closer to the USA rate (p.247).   Stable societies with a fairly equitable distribution of wealth, and opportunities to advance, make a peaceful society (p.262). Nations with high homicide rates do not have these qualities. If you want America to be as peaceful as Sweden or Switzerland, you will need the same “gun control” laws as in these countries. The final chapter lists what must be done to reduce the crime rate. But the powerful special interests will prevent this from happening until more people unite to overcome these forces.	2002-02-26

This still profitable business was shut down when production was moved to Mexico. Computers resulted in a great increase in the use of cut papers, and this needed more staples to fasten them together.    Chapter Two quotes the David Ricardo statement of \\"comparative advantage\\" (p.71). Isn't this just a simple argument created to support a point of view, and not reality? It doesn't address shipping costs, or other facts. Hardware and other goods CAN be manufactured in America and Poland, or France and Portugal. This example masks the political decisions hidden in his argument. Page 75 quotes Ricardo again, and notes it was false when he wrote it; another created argument. Pages 78-79 repeat the praises for President Salinas, then. He unilaterally lowered Mexican tariffs to allow US exports to gain market share; the book says this wrecked the Mexican economy, and Salinas fled the country to avoid arrest for murder and money laundering! The net effect was to loot and impoverish the country.    Page 95 speaks of the Republicans and Democrats as if they were real things, and not just names for a collection of special interests that create oratory to advance their aims. Page 97 discusses the rational of lowered tariffs: to fight \\"communism\\" by importing foreign goods! The fact that those who profited by financing and merchandising these imports also influenced government policy is just another coincidence. Pages 99-125 tell of the intrigue behind the passing of NAFTA (like other special interest legislation). These pages are one of the most important part of the book!    Chapter Three investigates the details of the NAFTA agreement. It starts with the candidature of William Clinton, a \\"master of two-dimensional obfuscation\\" (\\"like Woodrow Wilson\\") on p.143. Clinton's attraction was that, however flawed, he could win and the politicians preferred him over a loser, however pure. Clinton supported NAFTA because that was where the big money was (p.150). Also, it would not give Bush an issue when Clinton was ahead in the polls.    Chapter Four deals with the politics of passing NAFTA with Democratic Party votes. President Clinton sought the help of the Republican Party and the Fortune 500 (p.199). Why? \\"Politics is self-interest. Simply put, it's complete self-interest. The fact of the matter is, they'll get in bed with anyone\\" (p.201). Pages 17-8 tell how a \\"grass roots\\" campaign is manufactured. Pages 218-9 tell how a \\"grass tops\\" campaign is run: find important people in a congressional district and get them to repeat your requests in person. with a lower tariff on Mexican imports, the lost revenue means higher taxes for Americans whether or not they still have a job (p.232).    \\"The fact of the matter is they won NAFTA because of money, because of gifts, because of special interests, goodies, and everything else. They did not necessarily win the debate\\" (p.275). Since then the number of manufacturing jobs have declined; NAFTA helped to export jobs, not goods (p.282). Pages 285-6 lists the bad things that happened after NAFTA's ratification. Page 291 says the abolition of the Mexican communal land system (like the English Encclosure Acts) drove millions off the land, and some across the border; an increasing pool of cheap labor.	2002-01-25

Kennedy	Books	5	17	19	N	N	Memoirs of an Insider	Events in the real world and society are mostly planned, they do not just happen. This book presents selected events from 1943 to 1990. The major events of this time were craftily and systematically planned by the power elite. This book will attempt to explain the Cold War, the Korean and Vietnam wars, the effects of the development of the hydrogen bomb, and why the \\"military-industrial complex\\" removed JFK from the Presidency.    L. Fletcher Prouty spent 1955-64 as chief of special operations. Page xxxiii tells of one incident he witnessed of the \\"power elite\\". Page 4 explains how an agent for the East India Company created an ideological justification for eliminating unwanted people. Page 8 says that neither H-bombs or \\"Star Wars\\" can prevent warfare by terrorists.    Pages 15-16 tells of the driving force of acquisitiveness. Mineral wealth is controlled by corporate interests directly, or by the World Bank or International Monetary Fund. Genocide is regularly practices to limit the \\"excess population\\", particularly those who object to this exploitation. He repeats Elliot Roosevelt's story about Stalin's claim that FDR was poisoned (he had spies everywhere?).    \\"Many of the skilled saboteurs and terrorists of today are the CIA students of yesterday\\" (p.37). \\"The first aerial hijackings were publicly solicited by the US in return for big cash awards, plus sanctuary\\". Page 56 tells why so many of our leaders are lawyers: they are trained to work under the direction of their clients. Their \\"lawyer-client confidence\\" ensures secrecy, even in court; they work for international law firms in government, banks, and major industries.    Chapter Six, \\"Genocide by Transfer\\", tells how over a million Tonkinese were moved to Cochin China; it caused a rice shortage in a previously rice-exporting country! The destruction of self-sufficient villages created consumers of imported food (like post-1962 Burma), and enriched merchants and shippers. It also created a source of cheap labor?    Chapter Seven tells of the destruction of the village economy, and the resulting banditry. The depopulation of rural counties and the \\"urban renewal\\" in the big cities caused internal migration and a rise in the crime rate here in America too. After Textron Corporation bought Bell helicopters, there was now a need for these helicopters in Vietnam. Page 108 tells how 43% of lives lost were \\"not from action by hostile forces\\" - just accidents! The high cost of machines and their need for maintenance (supplies, personnel) helped to lose the war.    L. Fletcher Prouty says the massive slaughter in Cambodia, the Iran-Iraq war, \\"Desert Storm\\", and the Middle East hostilities are an example of Malthusian social engineering (p.187).    Chapter 16 explains the economic reasons for coups d' etat, whether Marcos in the Phillipines, Batista, Somoza, or Trujillo (pp. 236-7). Once a puppet ruler in s country tries to counteract its exploitation, its goodbye. Page 238 tells how \\"foreign aid\\" is used to support American companies moving their factories and machinery to foreign countries. Page 240 explains why Vietnam (like Korea) was a limited \\"unwinnable\\" war.    On November 22, 1963 JFK was removed from office by a powerful group that wanted to escalate the war in Vietnam, and increase government spending (p.257). Pages 261-4 answers those who mistakenly claim JFK did not want to withdraw military forces from Vietnam. Prouty presents information from the public record and his personal experience. NSAM#263 shows that JFK did plan to withdraw military personnel from Vietnam in 1963. The death of JFK changed the war in Indochina from low-intensity to a major operation. Page 291 lists the many things done as standard security procedure which were NOT done on 11-22-1963. If the Warren Report is wrong on any key point, then it is false. Governor Connally contradicted the key point of the Warren Report to his dying day.    The assassination of JFK demonstrated that most major events of world significance are masterfully planned and orchestrated by an elite coterie of enormously powerful people (p.334). You can read Jim Marrs' \\"Rule by Secrecy\\". The August 31, 1983 downing of Korean Air flight 007 resulted in the largest Defense Department budget ever passed in peacetime.	2002-01-22
