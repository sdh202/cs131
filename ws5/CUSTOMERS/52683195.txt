I rated this a four instead of a five because it really is not up to Tim Green's previous books that I have read. Fourth Perimeter is fantastic. If you are thinking of buying this as an introduction to Tim Green, try his Fourth Perimeter first.<br /><br />I won't go into a review of the story as others have done that already. What I will say about this is the characters are believable and the setting only enhances the novel. The plot starts fast and only picks up speed until the end. It is a good book.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-10-11

There were lovely pictures though.	2005-10-10

It is a sturdy book that will put up with a lot of wear and use. There are nice color pictures and some recipes have pictures of how to make a dish to go with the directions.<br /><br />The recipes are fun and are from all over Asia. They are actually devided into country of origin rather than by type of recipe. For example, the recipes from one country are grouped together rather than having all of the chicken dishes grouped together. I like the layout and look of this book and have found it easy to use.<br /><br />While it has some ingredients that are uncommon that is part of the nature of cooking these types of dishes. The directions are easy to follow and the results are great. There are some of the more traditional type of dishes you might expect to find (egg rolls, spring rolls etc) and some unexpected recipes as well.<br /><br />I really enjoy this cookbook. I use it quite a bit.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-10-10

It uses the premise that there are many foods that are prepared or slightly prepared (think already peeled carrots, deli chickens etc) that you can use to make a good meal.<br /><br />The directions are clear and easy to understand, the additional comments are helpful and only clarify any directions. The ingredient needed are generally common ingredients. The end result on every meal I have tried is delicious.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-10-10

There are original recipes from every era in America History- Indian recipes from before the Pilgrims landed, recipes during prohibition and so on. The commentary that goes with each recipe helps to put the recipe in its historical context and provides an overview for what was going on at the time. It is interesting reading and fun to try these recipes. The directions are clear and most of the recipes do not require unusual ingredients. Additionally the end results are usually pretty good.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for homeschoolers hoping to put a new twist on history and teaching about people of the past.

A fun "Beach Read"	If you can suspend your expectation of what reality is- this is a great book. It is fun, fast moving, and exciting.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt is an amazing hero. As one reviewer wrote he is a combination of the Terminator, Indiana Jones, and James Bond rolled into one. He is never afraid and calm in the worst circumstances. He saves the lives of his friends and himself many times over in this book alone. AND he gets the girl.<br /><br />Most importantly he is fairly well off and has a great job with a government agency that seems to have unlimited funds and resources at hand.<br /><br />Once you get over saying 'Yeah right' with disbelief, you will enjoy reading this book. It is a fun book. The plot line moves quickly, the rest of the characters are believable and the setting is fantastic.<br /><br />Basically this book begins when Dirk Pitt and his friend rush to a sink hole to save two diving archeologists. In the course of saving them from certain death they learn of an ancient golden treasure that has been lost. They learn they might be able to find it. At the same time some crooked men are learning about this treasure and gathering clues towards finding it as well. And the race is on.<br /><br />Again it is a fun beach read that moves fast. I enjoy all of the Dirk Pitt novels and look for more. I think they are worth the money.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-10-10

There were several recipes in there that my family requested again and again. Based on that, I picked up this cookbook as well.<br /><br />This cookbook is a bit more comprehensive that her Can Opener Gourmet cookbook. There are more recipes and they might be a bit more difficult than the recipes in the other cookbook. However, every recipe I have tried has been fairly easy, uses common ingredients, and turns out well. In fact there are many recipes my family has requested that came from this cook book.<br /><br />These are the type of recipes a young child who can read and work an oven safely can easily throw together. Additionally these are the type of recipes that can be thrown together in a short amount of time. You can easily add or delete or change the recipe to suit your taste also.<br /><br />It is well worth the money.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-10-10

So while I can roast my own red peppers or make many of my own sauces, by using some already processed foods I can make delicious meals in a short amount of time.<br /><br />The directions are clear and easy to understand. Most of the recipes do not require unusual or hard to find ingredients. The results are great. I have made many meals that are requested by my family members.<br /><br />For a busy mother like me who likes to cook and doesn't have time to do it all from scratch this is a good compromise.<br /><br />Worth the money.

Because of the large success of the Dan Brown Da Vinci Code there are obviously some comparisons but that is unfair to this book. This book can stand on it's own as a book about a puzzle.<br /><br />In this story the main character stumbles across a mention of a man going into a pyramid for two days with a mysterious package. From deciphering the story and solving a puzzle on a pyramid wall, the plot moves fast and furious.<br /><br />I particularly like that the main character is all too human. He is excitable and falls in love and makes some mistakes in judgements.<br /><br />This story starts moving early in the book and the action continues to the very end.

What he says is much the same as I have said repeatedly. I am a former teacher and a homeschooling mother and agree with much of what he says.<br /><br />This book provides a well thought out argument, well rounded argument about why homeschooling in the end, is the best thing for our children.

Each one focuses on the positive and on God's place in these events.<br /><br />For example, one short story was about Daniel Webster and the talk he gave on Plymouth Rock. However, it emphasizes Daniel Webster's belief in God and the role God played in his life.<br /><br />The book brought home to me the high price that many people have paid for our freedoms. It also brought home to me again, the large part that God played in this Country from the beginning to now.<br /><br />These are short stories that do not focus on every aspect of each life or event they chose to include in this book. There are books that have been written about each person and each event that goes into greater detail. I will agree the authors overlooked some of the negative aspects of our history. The previous reviewer is correct. However, I do not think that is the point of this book. This book is a celebration of God and the role he has played in this country.<br /><br />I found this book to be very powerful. It was a strong reminder to me that I have much to be thankful for and much to appreciate in this country. This country has much that is worth protecting. It was a strong reminder to me that God is ever present in our lives and that He has a greater purpose in mind.<br /><br />Having said that, I did not find that this was an \\"God-- In your Face\\" type of book. Rather, through quotes from these historical people and events in history a great story is retold.<br /><br />Well worth every penny.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2004-11-02

The pictures are pretty and compliment the text well.<br />This is a bit simple for adults familiar with the cajun culture. However, it is a great book for children and a lovely book for a 'coffee table' book.<br />Enjoy.	2004-05-18

The author makes some claims that seem a bit 'odd' until you read his book and see how he has dotted the i's and crossed the t's with his research.<br />The one downfall of this book, in my opinion, was that Bob Brewer in this book always turns out to be a victim of unethical lying people and he is always the good guy. In my opinion, he came across as a bit of a martyr. That made reading this book somewhat difficult at times.<br />However, this was an interesting read. It makes you believe that if you just connect the clues you too can find gold. Of course, I'm sure it's not the simple. But this book makes it seem possible.<br />Again, the best part of the book was the history.<br />enjoy.	2004-04-18

I really enjoyed those. I thought this one might be similar to that. I was a bit dissapointed that it was not similar.<br />However, this book is a very enjoyable read.<br />It really makes you think. At the start of the book there are trees that are mutated into houses that people must live in. During the course of the book civilization as we know it ends and a new form of society is founded. Fauns educated children, vehicles are alive, and more fantastic things occur.  The end is a particularly interesting end in that it leaves you thinking about our use of genetic engineering and so on.<br />Enjoy.	2004-04-18

As her brother wanders around doing his 'kung fu' imitation, a man is found dead. The police are not looking for other suspects and this leaves Meg to do the research.<br />From getting knocked out by a moose head, feeding a buzzard, a vet covered in tattoos, and more- this is a funny book.<br />Well worth reading. I think this is maybe on of her best books.<br />Enjoy.	2004-03-16

My son who is four has really enjoyed reading chapter books at night. So I bought this one, and he loved it.<br />The Littles are tiny people with tails. They live in the walls of the home of the Biggs. The Littles use odds and ends that the Biggs no longer need to build an elevator, eat etc.<br />In this story the Biggs go on vacation and the Littles have new big people living in the home. For three weeks the Newcombs don't take out the garbage and mice come. There is excitement and bravery.<br />This is an adorable book. We are buying more.<br />Enjoy.	2004-03-08

The pictures teaming with people from every walks of life with lots of little stories in the greater scene.<br />Now my kids are old enough to begin looking for Waldo. My four year old son is very entertained by looking for Waldo. He has spent hours looking at this book.<br />This book you have to find the dog's tail, waldo, the thing he lost, and several Waldo watchers. It's fairly hard and yet my son still loves it.<br />Enjoy.	2004-02-27

I find myself laughing at times, grimacing at others.<br />The author has a great understanding of snakes and other reptiles. His respect for crocodiles comes across very clearly in this book. He also has a great understanding of human nature and some of the stories he tells are touching and sensitive. Others are hilarious and I laughed out loud while reading this book<br />The book is well written and enjoyable. It is easy to read and grabs you right from the opening pages. Even when he is lecturing to the reader or providing information, it is done in context and is very interesting.<br />Well worth every penny.<br />Enjoy.	2004-02-27

This is excellent. The stories are complete and yet are simple to read. Each story takes up one page. The other page has a picture of the even in a coloring book line drawing form. The pictures are detailed so it is not a young child's coloring book, but that does not mean a yougn child could not color the pages. But this goes beyond, is more in depth, than a young child's coloring book or simple Bible story book.<br />Enjoy.	2003-12-17

She seems to find dead bodies where she lives, works, and visits. In this book a body of a famous chef shows up in her cookie shop. In order to get back into her store and make a living, Hannah ends up working on the case. She dates two men, one a cop and another a dentist, while she manages to keep her business running, solve several murders and save herself from a deadly ending.<br />The book is fairly fast paced. It is a fun book and the characters are fairly believable once you get past the idea that cops might possibly share ongoing investigation information with a mere citizen. Hannah's mother is a character that adds some light hearted moments to the book.<br />I enjoyed this book and look forward to buying more by this same author.<br />Enjoy.	2003-12-04

Level A, Set 1  (re-released as Bob Books Set 1- Beginning Readers)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Excellent First Readers	These first readers are excellent. There are small black and white line drawings and simple words based on a phonetic approach. The first books introduce the basic sounds of the alphabet in their easiest form.<br />My son knows the sounds of his alphabet and was able to read the first three books in this set with no problem.<br />The black and white drawings can be used to have further discussion- what did this character look like? Is he happy to have a cat sit one him? There is not extra information in the drawing to distract the kids. The drawings add to the text rather than distract from the words.<br />The books are short and easy to read and will give a child who has a basic idea of the sounds of letters a success in reading.<br />Worth Every Penny.<br />Enjoy.	2003-11-04

This book basically teaches you how to make simple small books using paper, pencils, and a stapler. That is it. There are a lot of examples and pictures that show you different ways to use each book. The ideas are great. The directions are easy.<br />Well worth the money.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-29

It is easy to read and it is interesting. Mr. Wilson does not just write about Shakespear and give his theories, he provides reasoned arguments about those theories. Mr. Wilson also provides alternative arguments and alternative theories regarding Shakespear.<br />My only complaint? I'd like to see a list of the main people that are discussed with some clue as to their context. I say this because you will be introduced to someone on page 10 and not read about him again until page 87. A quick reference page would be very helpful in keeping everyone straight.<br />Otherwise, this is a great book.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-29

We have loved them.<br />The books are fun enough and interesting enough to keep the attention of a four year old over the course of several nights. There are a few pictures and they are charmingly illustrated.<br />In this book, the plot is centered around Stanely and a magic lamp. The story is fun and although a fantasy type book, easy for even young children to grasp.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-29

It is a fast read, but very thought provoking. Mr. Kinkade and his wife have written with thought and insight about what they have done to make the marriage work. A marriage is work, it takes an investment of time and energy, this doesn't mean it can't be fun. This book demonstrates that in many ways. I believe every couple married, engaged, or just dating should read this book. It provides a long term view of a marriage that works, the sacrifices, the joys, the love and respect that this couple have for each other and gives me an image to work towards.<br />Well Worth reading.	2003-10-29

We are building an addition. This book was very detailed oriened yet fairly easy to understand. It covers everything from heating and air conditioning to duct work to repairs to explaining basic terms.<br />If you are working on an addition or building a house this would be a good book to buy.<br />It is not a book of ideas or suggested floor plans. Rather, this book will help you build the addition or build the house once you have decided what you are doing. This a book more about the 'guts' or the 'behind the scenes' of the house building.<br />Well worth the money.	2003-10-29

Hence the low four star rating. The hero runs around doing what he needs to do because he was told 'stand up and do your duty' as a child and the heroine just goes along for lack of anything better to do. Once they begin to fall in love and see each other though, the book really comes through with a great love story. By the end of the book I couldn't help but like all the characters in the novel. It made me want to run out and buy the other books in this series. I have a feeling they will be better.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-29

Look at Art with Children	This is a good book for adults and children. There is a picture on one page and on the next page there is a little bit of information about the picture and some questions to inspire thinking about the picture.<br />Examples of questions might be- what are the childrenn in this painting feeling? What makes you think so? What is the father in this painting thinking about?<br />This book inspires young children to look at pictures in a different way. It inspires them to put the story to the painting and to explore what the painting is trying to 'say'. Because of this it is a good introduction to art for young children.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-29

I rated it a five because if you were looking for ideas on bears, space or any of the many thematic units discussed in this book, you would find many ideas in this book. Also, many of the ideas in this book can be adapted easily up or down by a year or two.<br />However, it is my belief that any creative teacher can sit down and come up with most of these ideas by his/herself. I was looking for something new and exciting and different and this book did not offer that for me.<br />I'm not sure that it is worth the mony if you are a teacher who already has a large set of idea book or if you are very creative. If you are beginning though or you do not see yourself as creative and want some ideas, this book may be a good start.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-29

Jack Reacher is kidnapped at gun point with a young woman who is with the FBI. Just to make matters worse, the woman has been injured previously and can't walk without a cane and can't run and she is important politically as well.<br />Jack Reacher manages to bring down a militia organization that wants to go to war with the united states and kill women and children to prove a point. He manages to stop the  bombing and save the girl.<br />It's an excellent book in the traditional Lee Child way. The tension is tight and the fast. Jack Reacher is a person who is realistic and so are the other characters in the book.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-29

If you are a creative person you might be able to come up with some of these recipes on your own. Also, some of these are listed on her webpage with the same name.<br />So, if you are looking for just one cute idea to take to a party, you might skip the book and visit the author's website.<br />If you teach young children or stay at home with them, you might find that this book is a true winner. My son loves looking at htis book. We have made some of these recipes. They are very easy to make and require mostly on hand ingredients. Some do require things we don't normally have on hand (like pink marshmellow coconut cakes.)<br />Everything is very easy to make. Some of the items are made from already prepared foods and just arranged to look like something else.<br />Very creative, very fun.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-05

I refer to it often. There are many many recipes and every one of them has turned out great.<br />Most of the recipes require only typical ingredients that a cook will have on hand. Although there is a chapter for cooking game such as elk, duck and goose. Every recipe I have tried was easy to make, the directions were clear, and the results great.<br />There are also little tidbits of history, and colorado trivia included. A fun read.<br />I particularly like the Wynona Granola recipe. There are some fantastic chicken recipes and creative breakfast ideas.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-05

It brought home to me how much was sacrificed during the fight for independence. Although about one person, there are many fascinating stories that are included in this book.<br />The author is obviously a large fan of Francis Marion. On one page alone he is described as heroic, strong, honest, trustworthy, quick thinking, witty, and so on.<br />I would have appreciated a larger map.<br />However, overall this book is a good read.<br />Enjoy.	2003-10-03

The majority of recipes are dump and go. The majority of recipes require ingredients that most people have on hand- cream of mushroom soup, chicken, etc.<br />If you have never really used your slow cooker, this is a great beginner book that will help you explore the wide range of meals you can make in a slow cooker.<br />Now the Negative: I bought this cookbook expecting some different types of recipes-However, most of the recipes in this cookbook are unimaginative and easy to think of without a cookbook. In fact, I would say that there are a majority of them that I have already made without picking up a cookbook.<br />If you have already used your slow cooker quite a bit and if you are looking for something a little bit different, this is probably not the cookbook for you. There are a few recipes I had never tried and a few combinations I hadn't thought of in this book. However, I don't think I would suggest you buy this cookbook for only one or two recipes.<br />I think this is a fine cookbook and if you decide to buy it, just be forwarned, the recipes are very simple and very easy and if you have used your slow cooker very much, very unimaginative.	2003-09-28

I thought this book was exactly what I wanted. It wasn't. It was not helpful at all. I rarely give poor ratings and I want to be very clear as to why I gave this book such a low rating.<br />There was very little thought put to providing a reader with the overall picture of the house both before and after the space was added and the impact the addition made upon the home. THis is a big issue when speaking of additions. I believe, you have to think of resale value, usability, melding the old with the new and so on. I believe this book did very little in terms of communicating any of this to the reader.<br />1- There were no floor plans or drawings to show the before and after of adding space to a home.<br />2- There were very few before and after photographs to show how adding space impacted a home. The photos that were included, and there were alot of photos, really didn't show how the space melded with the old. The other thing I noticed was that many of the photographs seemed to be taken at night so you could see the add on lit up, and although this was neat, I would want to see it during the day as well.<br />3- Everything was really about light and windows and was very 'out there' in my opinion. For example, there was an addition of a second story/loft over a kitchen and the floor? Glass so you could look right down to the kitchen through your glass floor. Very unrealistic if you think of cleaning and privacy at the very least. A lot of boxy, square add ons that had no meaning to the original house. A gorgeous brick home was topped with copper for example. It might have been award winning, and it might appeal to some, but I thought it was down right ugly.<br />In ending, I thought this book was not very helpful. I thought there were some interesting ideas, but not enough information to see how I might use these ideas with my own home. Also, it leaned heavily towards the 'outerspace, streamlined' type look with lots of glass and chrome. This did not appeal to me and would not appeal to those of us who want the more traditional look. There are other books out there about doing additions that are more useful. I would suggest that this book is for those people who like the artsy/space look with lots of glass and chrome and odd additions with no care to the original home.type look with lots of glass and chrome.

He also finds many disadvantages to being flat.<br />This book is a great book for opening discussion with your child-What are the advantages of being you? What do you wish you could change? How can you change? and so on.<br />This is also a great book for letting your child make his own flat stanley and send it off to friends for an adventure. Many schools are doing this now. A great way to teach geography. There is a website based on this type of activity a search for flat travelers should bring it up.<br />Well worth the money.<br />Enjoy.	2003-09-13

All of this has been useful in making some decisions before we begin spending money on a contractor, architect or supplies. The text of this book is as helpful if not more so than the pictures.

And I have to say that I still thought this was a great novel.<br />Reacher is picked up by a lady with a six year old daughter while hitchiking on the road. He fast becomes embroiled in a family full of problems. Not only are the problems family problems but the friends of the family are trouble as well.<br />This is truly a novel of where the past actions come back to haunt the characters of the book.

I'd rate this a high four or a low five. Why? because in the end, the end part of three pivotal characters is just kind of glossed over. In fact, I so much expected and wanted to find out what happened I went back and reread the part again to see if I missed something. I hadn't. So this made for a weakness in the book in my mind.<br />Other than that- the book is great. In fact, so far, anything I have read by this author has been excellent.<br />As always the action is tight as Jack Reacher travels across the country to solve a problem that isn't his. The story is well written and believable.<br />I really liked the ending although this is one of the few Reacher novels I have been able to 'solve' before the ending. I also really liked the addition of a new love for Jack Reacher. The new girlfriend really gives Jack a more human touch as he falls in love with her and settles down a bit.<br />Jack Reacher however, is a hero in my eyes. He takes care of the little people, he gets rid of the big nasty people and he is a true human with flaws and strenths. He is smart and interesting.<br />This book is well worth reading, as are all of the Jack Reacher novels.<br />Enjoy.	2003-08-21

But not the last one I'll read by this author. Lee Child has set up a tight story with many twists and turns. The action is fast and the plot raises and barely gives you time to catch your breath before it raises again. The ending is superb and fascinating. This is absolutely well worth reading.<br />Enjoy.	2003-08-21

It keeps you one the edge of your seat.<br />Jack Reacher is blackmailed by the FBI to solve a series of murders that he's first been accused of and later been absolved of. Jack travels the country in an effort to solve these murders. Even at the end, when I just can't imagine how these murders are committed, Jack solves the problem and saves yet another woman.<br />Jack is smart, interesting, well read and at times I even get a chuckle out of his comments and behavior. He is also hard and knows how to do what needs to be done in a tight situation. Jack takes care of the little guys and brings the big ugly nasties down to size. He is my new hero.<br />This isn't my first Jack Reacher novel nor will it be my last. In fact, I even like the novels by this author that are not Reacher novels.<br />Well worth the money.<br />Enjoy.	2003-08-21

They cover the basics and they do it well. With just these three books, a few math manipulatives, and a selection of books for reading you too can homeschool. These books cover everything you need for the basics. They provide me the confidence I need and a reminder to keep it simple. I wish I had found these books first before reading any of the other 'how to homeschool' type books or wasting my time trying to find a prepackaged curriculum.<br />Enjoy.	2003-08-21

However, this book struck me as having a well thought out hypothesis. It is backed up by much research and evidence.<br />The author was able to write convincingly and to keep my interest at the same time. There was much information and the book could easily have become mired down in facts and proof and could easily have become boring. This did not happen. THe author was able to present the facts and research and keep it interesting.<br />Although his theory does not back up a world flood as depicted in the Biblical story of Noah, the theory is none the less interesting and believable.<br />Well worth reading.<br />Enjoy.	2003-08-08

I saw this demonstrated once and immediately recognized that it hit all the areas of learning. By writing and making the sounds and seeing the letters and hearing the sounds children begin to read.<br />When my son wanted to read I tried this method. My three year old and I began doing this with the flashcards although he really wasn't up to writing the letters with a pencil. I provided him with markers and other writing tools that use large motors and we began learning together.<br />He is now reading. I didn't find it tedious or difficult or hard. I particularly like that this is a method you can use to suppliment school or do at homeschooling and I like that it will be effective for many grades with spelling words provided.<br />Wonderful program.	2003-08-08

It has recipes that are the old traditional such as pancakes and runs the gamut to recipes from various parts of the country.<br />The recipes do not generally call for any out of the ordinary ingredients, they are easy to follow and the end results of every recipe I have tried turns out great.<br />The pictures are lovely. The pages are uncluttered and easy to read. However, I particularly like that there are sidebars with interesting facts, menus from eating establishments say from the 1940's, etc. It makes for an interesting read as well as a nice cookbook.<br />This is the cookbook I regularly turn to when picking out what I'm going to make for breakfast. It is well worth the money.<br />Enjoy.	2003-07-26

I was very dissapointed in this book. The blurb on the back sounded so good. Instead this book quickly became a waste of my time.<br />The premise of a character coming to life (or in this case two) because the author has written them so well is interesting. The idea of a little romance between the author and the character is exciting. The potential for humor and laughter was there in the plot. However, this book just couldn't carry it through.<br />The main character Maggie was unbelievable, she didn't seem real and her reaction to the events in her life were unrealistic. Saint Just was pompous and over all not a very interesting person. The writing read like it was very forced and often times did not flow very smoothly. The humor never fully materialized and as another reviewer stated, what was funny in the start was old by the end of the book.<br />Overall, I don't see why others gave this book such high reviews. The potential was there, but the book did not live up to the potential.	2003-07-26

This book is funny and insightful. The author has written about women and their place in politics and how many important issues are overlooked by men in politics. She was very direct and to the point that there all issues are important to women although not all issues are important to men (such as mammogram scanner machines). She talks about how she overcame some of the preconcieved notions men had about her as a woman and how she learned to survive in politics. Very interesting.<br />enjoy.	2003-07-21

It gives you an overview of what to expect at different ages and stages of children. It covers what they can do physically as well as emotionally and educationally.<br />This is a much more detailed book than many checklists I've seen and covers many more guideposts for parents and teachers to watch for. I like that this book states very clearly that these are just guidelines and that each child grows at a different rate and that you will see some of these guidelines early and some of them later but this is a general idea of what a child can be expected to do at certain ages.<br />Parents can use this book to be sure their child is growing and developing in an appropriate fashion. In later years (school age years) parents can use this book to be sure teachers are working with kids in an age appropriate manner.<br />Teachers can use this book as well to enhance their teaching as they learn what students are capable of at certain ages.<br />Well worth the money.<br />Enjoy.	2003-06-01

It is based on facts- studies, observations, etc. It is not an academic book that you might read if you were going to school. It is written for the parent, the person who takes care of children, the average every day person who is curious about how children learn and what can be done to encourage the learning. It is easily read and easily understood.<br />I particularly like that it doesn't stress pushing your child to learn more, learn faster, work harder. It just suggests ways that anyone around children can gently children learn.<br />Well worth reading.<br />Enjoy.	2003-04-24

They are full of easy to follow recipes, time savers, hints and helps. The recipes require normal ingredients and rarely anything fancy. Every meal I have made has turned out fantastic.

This is why I rated it so low.<br />This is basically a set of stories from the Bible and coloring pages from a Bible printed in 1479 in Germany. It would take a very patient adult to give credit to the page by coloring it.<br />If you are looking for Bible Stories with illustrations for adults then this is a fine book. If you are looking for Bible stories that you can read to children and you, the adult are going to color the page, this is fine as well. But it really doesn't work well for children.	2003-04-24

I have a few complaints about layout of this book. Some of the print (like the names of the recipes) is just not easy to read. The recipes are put on three or four pages, so although this book has many pages, it doesn't have as many recipes as I anticipated. I felt there was a too large section in the front to discuss each name brand and type of indoor grill available. This section will soon be outdated and rarely used. I would have liked to have seen this shorter and had more recipes.<br />The recipes though are fantastic. This cookbook is well worth the money just to get these excellent recipes. They are fairly easy to follow and require very few, if any, exotic ingredients. The results are outstanding.<br />I am glad I bought my indoor grill. It is very useful.

The author can take Joanna from introspection to inspection of a crime scene in a few pages with very little problem in the transition. Although each book can be read on it's own as a stand alone novel, I have had much satisfication of reading them in order and watching the characters grow and change in each book.<br />This book lives up to the reputation of the author.<br />Joanna is planning her wedding, Butch is really, and chasing the bad guys at the same time.

This is a good read.<br />I ranked it a high three/low four because the ending kind of seemed slapped together. Also, and more importantly, the book really never hit a high point in action. There was a lot of agony in the characters (sister gets divorced, brother in law has an affair, best friend leaves husband and so on).<br />Having said all that though- it was a good read.<br />The writing is clean and crisp. It flows and it is easy to like the main character. She has a good grasp on who she is and what is important.

In this book she's paired with JP Beaumont, a character from another set of Jance series.<br />One of the things I particularly like about this book is that Jance is able tell more of the stories of many of the characters in previous books. Angie and the Parrot man, Bobo, JP's first wife and more are all interwoven into this book. AND, she does all of this without losing the main story.<br />As Joanna works to solve a murder about a woman, she learns the woman was in a witness protection program, based out of Seattle, until it was time for her to testify in court. JP is sent from Seattle to help her and to find out the leak of the witness protection program.<br />Together these two make a great combination. Something I didn't expect.<br />Although each of these books by Jance in the Joanna series can be read alone, I would suggest you read them in order.<br />Enjoy.	2003-01-01

Although each novel can stand on it's own, I have found that reading them in order is a better idea.

Joanna has just been elected Sherrif when a grisly murder is discovered. A drugged up ex movie star, a wierd therapist, an old family fued of sorts and the stage is set for a great novel.<br />Joanna is a strong woman and this is a good book. It's good to read about her efforts to mourn with her daughter the loss of her husband. As she comes to grip with the past, she learns to deal with the present.

Although each book can stand alone, later books reference earlier books and it is, in my opinion, much more enjoyable to read them in order so you know the complete history.<br />Having said all of that, this is the best book I have read to date in this series.<br />Joanna was elected sherrif and is off for training. By doing a favor for a friend of a friend, she runs into a serial killer that has escaped detection for many years. There is a touch, just a tiny touch, of romance. There is also a very stressful period of time when her daughter has been kidnapped and the kidnapper has killed himself and the police are searching frantically for Joanna's daughter and the daughter's friend.<br />This book moves right along, the characters are well developed and there is excitement.

While trying to make ends meet, listen to sister in law and brother bicker, and teach several young girls how to cater, she begins to find clues to the identity of the killer.<br />It isn't until the end when another attempted murder and a possible lawsuit brings it all into the open about who the murderer is and the motive.<br />The end is good. I rated it a four stars because Jean mostly just stumbles on the answer rather than really trying to find the answer to the question: Who is the murderer? In fact, she's not even thinking about the whole thing, nor is she even putting any of the clues she has together. So it really isn't a detective book. It rather a book about a caterer who stumbles across a body and who stumbles across a murderer.<br />However, it is still an entertaining little book.<br />Enjoy	2002-11-10

Generally her books are funny, enjoyable, quirky and fun to read.<br />I would rate this book a high three or a very low four.<br />This book was quirky and there were some funny parts, but much of it was just too far beyond belief. The national guard comes out to guard and egg and start aiming their guns at themselves and everyone around them? Please... The egg glows and makes colors and noises and then when the great hatching begins, no one is there to witness it? I'm sure... It was just so far beyond belief it was hard to suspend belief and enjoy the book.<br />To top it off, I felt that the characters were not well developed. I would have liked to learn more about what made them tick.<br />What saved this book from being a two star book were the funny  parts of the book. The mayor with his wild clothes and bunny slippers, the alien was a riot.<br />I would consider buying other books by this author before I bought this one. I think there are other books out there that are worth your money more than this one is.	2002-11-08

This was my least favorite of all the books by Sue Civil-Brown.<br />First the positive: The saving grace of this book was the zany, creative characters. There was an aunt who has tigers for pets, an uncle who paints and so on. The characters in this book gave me some chuckles. I also liked how there were characters from previous books interwoven into this book. It is nice to revisit old characters and see how their lives are moving forward. I particularly liked Seth in many ways, he was the adult voice that Kelly needed to hear. Also, because this is a Sue Civil-Brown book, my least favorite book of hers is far better than other author's best books.<br />And the negative:<br />Right from the beginning Kelly, the main character, was needy, whiney, somewhat self centered, and fairly certain she was the normal, sane person. Her family of aunts, uncles, grandmother were oblivious to her neediness. I couldn't help feeling that her family just needed to sit her down and explained in simple, honest terms that they loved her, were proud of her, that she didn't need to be a creative type to be important. If they had done that there would have been no story.<br />As it was, there really was very little plot. Kelly comes home to save her grandmother (and her grandmother's money) from Seth, a football star with a bum knee who has become a family friend. She is constantly on the lookout for the negative in him. Seth on the other hand has decided that Kelly has neglected her family and has no problem showing her his dislike for her.<br />Despite the initial dislike of each other, these two manage to gain respect for each other and eventually fall in love.<br />So, although this was my least favorite Sue Civil-Brown book, it isn't a complete waste of time or money to read. I just think that there are better books out there that are much more enjoyable.	2002-10-24

This is a must read for anyone who works with children, teaches children, raises children. This is about keeping them safe.<br />I have heard, I don't know how many times, 'it used to be safer...' 'we didn't used to worry so much' 'everyone knew who everyone else was'. This is not the case any more.<br />This book is important. For someone like me, who was raised in a small neighborhood where everyone knew everyone, this is an important book. For someone like me who was raised in a different time and in a different place, this was a valuable book to read.<br />This was an excellent book for me to read when I had children. It is one I am keeping on my shelf for future reading and reminding.<br />Well worth reading.	2002-10-20

And when she is called into look at a haunted building where many senior citizens live, she doesn't know what she is getting herself into.<br />Jake Carpenter is too logical and scientific for words. When he is voted president of the association and 'stuck' with Rainbow and a haunted building, little does he know the fun is just beginning.<br />With a little help from above and a lot of help from Mary Todd, this couple has a hard time finding time alone to get to know each other and yet they really don't stand a chance in the romance. They make such a great couple and are just the kind of people I'd like to know in real life.<br />The book just moves along at a fast pace and with a touch of humor and a touch of the out of the ordinary, this is a great beach reading type of book.<br />Enjoy.	2002-10-06

I have read the other reviews and they described in much detail the plot, so I will leave that to the other reviewers. I will share my impressions and thoughts about the book overall.<br />The characters were very real. Julia Summers know show she is and what she wants. She knows herself. She is willing to work hard to get to where she wants and she is able to set her priorities. Finn Callahan on the otherhand has been running from himself and his feelings for many years. He is tough, handsome, smart and strong in all ways. He doesn't take responsibility lightly, he takes it very seriously which leads him to have the weight of the world on his shoulders. When these two strong people meet, sparks fly.<br />The book is high on sexual tension and sexual chemestry. It is a great book. There is some humor thrown in the mix with the writer of the soap opera in which Julia stars.<br />The mystery doesn't overtake the romance but rather lends itself to the developing relationship between Julia and Finn. However, the mystery is enough to keep the suspense tight and the book moving along in a smooth reading.<br />I sat down and read this book until it was finished. I didnt want to put it down. I'm anxious to run out and buy the other ones by this author. I think I have found a new favorite author to go along with my other favorite authors.<br />Enjoy.	2002-10-06

Mary's long time suitor tries to help as well. Richard tries to keep all the pandomonium to a dull roar as he tries to help Mary legally.<br />Although this book references previous books and characters that were introduced in other books by the same author, this is a stand alone novel. And a good one it is. I was chuckling and mad and enjoyed the book completely.<br />Enjoy.	2002-09-30

For my three year old son who so desperately wants to read, he had no problem 'reading' this story. He was able to tell a story, look at the pictures and pick out different details and tell a different story. The pictures are gentle and kind and show a special relationship with imagination, dreams, wishes, children and the fine line between reality and imagination that children can walk with ease.<br />Enjoy.	2002-09-29

But since I had it, I decided to let my kiddos look at it and see if they liked it. They Did!!<br />My three year old, who wants to read, had no problem 'reading' this story and finding out all sorts of interesting aspects to the pictures as he read the book.<br />My son has bullied his little sister into helping him act out this little book. He has 'read' it to me many times over. He has enjoyed this book and so has my daughter.<br />I rated it a four because, as I said, I found the pictures just a bit creepy when we first got the book.

However, this is one book I'd skip and spend my money else where. The concept of the story itself was good, but the carry through in the writing was weak.<br />Three short stories in one, this is about the Colton Family who are celebrating Christmas and a Wedding all at once, when terrorists take over. During the course of the terrorist attack, three couples meet and fall in love.<br />First the positive: I liked that the women were cool under pressure and strong. I liked that they were classy and smart. I also liked the men who were caring and cute. The story idea was a great one with lots of potential. So although I say give this one a miss, it could be worse.<br />Now the rest of the information:<br />Billy who is a big, tough man has decided he'll never fall in love. Immediately after saying this, he walks into a dry cleaners only to fall in love at first sight. The girl is, amazingly, a diplomats daughter. Of course, when he leaves the dry cleaners, Billy doesn't know this, he doesn't know her name, nothing. But just by chance he opens the door during the party, there she is wanting to pick up something she hid as a young girl.<br />The coincidences in this book, never end and in this story there are more than any other stories. She just happnes to knock on the door he is visiting, terrorists just happen to take over while she's there, they just happen to be upstairs, he just happens to save her and so on. It really stretched the plot of the story and got tiring to read.<br />In the second story, a hostage negotiator and a swat man who loved each other, still love each other, but got divorced meet again. In an action that just screams STUPID, she decides to walk into the house and meet with the terrorists. This makes it clear to big SWAT man that he loves her and can't live without her. During the course of the night all their previous problems that caused the divorce in he first place just melt away and everything is great.<br />The tension that I would have expected to build during these stories never appears. The stories lurch along with very little tension between people or because of the situation. I was very dissapointed, because the second story had great potentional that I felt it didn't live up to.<br />In the third story Ian a very rich man manages to save Juliet a bridesmaid, attending the wedding party. He just happens to notice the cameras stop moving and just manages to get her into a coat closet in time. Despite her yammering and yaking, he manages to find a small crawl space. The cuddle up nice and cozy in a crawl space and get to know each other. After plannign the wedding and setting the date, he decides it's time to go out and save everyone else in the party. He distracts the terrorists when big strong swat man comes in and gets shot in the back.<br />But all ends well and everyone gets married and thus ends the book.ng is great. <br />The tension that I would have expected to build during these stories never appears.

Books	5	1	1	N	N	A family favorite	The easy rythm of this book makes it an easy one to read over and over and over... The illustrations are fantastic. They are creative and encouraged my son to experiment with his finger painting in a new way. (After we discussed it of course.) This is an excellent introduction to colors and you can use this as a jump off for other senses- we talk about the sounds, the colors and the food the animals in this book eat. It is a lot of fun.<br />I like books that you can use as an introduction to a new idea or to reteach an old one. THis book is well worth th money because there are so many things you can teach using this little book.<br />Enjoy.	2002-09-15

This is a story of a young girl picking blueberries with her mother and a young bear picking blueberries with its mother. As they amble along picking berries and eating them, the bear gets seperated from its mother as does Sal get seperated from her mother. The story is gentle from beginning to end. It brings back many memories of picking blueberries and eating them faster than you can pick them. This is a classic that I grew up with and my children are growing up with now. The pictures only enhance the text and are very gentle and sweet. The theme of the story is very nice and reassuring to young children.

They are creative and simple and only enhance the message of the text. <br />This book is no exception. The pictures are adorable. I particularly like the text of this book. The repetitive nature of the text is great for pre readers. They can 'memorize' parts of the book and 'read' it back to you. Very exciting for younger children. I find the ending of the book to be very creative and interesting and it really captures my child's attention. <br />This book can be used as a beginning to introducing animals, animal sounds, colors and more. It is a simple book and that makes it easy to read over and over and over again. <br />Enjoy.	2002-09-12

I enjoyed the others, but this one was excellent.<br />The characters were perfectly defined. It was easy to like the good guys and to pick out the bad guys. They were well developed both in thought and in action.<br />It was interesting to read the subplots that were in this book as well. The romance was just the right touch, not too much to make this book a romance, but enough to keep a little bit of human touch to the story.<br />Although this book can stand alone, it works well if you read the others that come prior to this novel.<br />Enjoy.	2002-09-12

My three year old son has enjoyed all of the Sheep by Shaw books we have in our library.<br />They are easy to read over and over because they have a catchy rythm that makes it easy to read and enjoy over and over. In fact, because they are so catchy and the rhymes are so easy to remember, I often hear my son 'reading' the book using the pictures as cues. Very nice.<br />Enjoy.	2002-09-12

This was a great find. Even now that he's starting to read, this is one of his favorite books to 'read'. It is creative and the pictures are adorable. They are funny and they tell a story.

It is the type of book you keep around for reference. Having said that though, I did sit down and page through this book and go many ideas regarding how to clean things that i thought I was doing a find job cleaning. What I learned, however, is that there might be a better way, a safer way, a less damaging way to clean something.<br />The author went right to the source of experts for cleaning directions.

There are great recipes sent in by customers and friends of the two women who started this catalog. The recipes are always good. I have not tried one that has been hard, used wierd ingredients, or didn't turn out excellently. There are nice comments at the start of each recipe suggesting pairings (applesauce is great with these pork chops, for example). And the end of each recipe is usually a little quote, a nice drawing, or some other little bonus. Although there are no pictures of the meals prepared, this series of Celebrate... are great cookbooks. Celebrate Winter is one of my favorites. I have made some great soups that I have not been ashamed to take to potlucks out of this recipe book. Great cookie recipes as well.<br />This is a cookbook well worth the money.<br />Enjoy.	2002-08-19

They are learning to work through old pains and hurts and to love each other again. The passion is intense. The story is nice. It is a nice ending to a lovely series.<br />I rated this four stars rather than the usual five. I found this book to be much anticipated and it did not live up to the promises hinted at in the other books of this series. Further, I got tired of hearing about how Nell was a good cook. To top that all of, once I learned the story of how Mia was hurt and why Sam had left, I was dissapointed with the poor reasoning.<br />Despite the above problems I had with the book, the series is wonderful and the story is nice. The book is rich in passion and history and love. It is well worth reading, particularly if you have read the others in the series.<br />Enjoy.	2002-08-12

In my opinion this is on the short list of must have books for kids!<br />The text is lovely. The pictures are adorable. The story line is funny and still based on fact. An egg hatches and out comes a hungry caterpillar who eats her way through everything. One day when she has had enough to eat, she makes a cacoon and comes out a lovely butterfly.<br />The bright pictures that fit in with the words and the predictability make this a good book for pre readers.

1445317:US	52683195	R3JDS8L66589AN	0895264064	845084509	Unlimited Access : An FBI Agent Inside the Clinton White House	Books	4	30	38	N	Y	MUST READ!  Shocking and Rings with Truth.	THis is a must read for everyone. Even now, even when President Clinton isn't president. Why?<br />Well, Al Gore is maybe going to run again? Hillary is making noises like running and both of these people are tied directly into how the White House was managed. And, this book is VERY clear in that Hillary Clinton was largely in charge of many of the scandles that occured during the Clinton years.<br />This book was a shock! Absolutely a shock to read how security for the President and First Lady was lacking during these years. This was a shock and what was even worse was to read how the House Oversight Committee did nothing, when it was in their power to do something, how the FBI 'caved in' when they didn't have to. IT was a shock to read the disregard to safety and security that was evident among the Clinton years.<br />And- not once have the allegations in this book been refuted. And many of these same issues have been brought up in the press (although lightly glossed over). This book rings with truth. This author continually worries over his reputation and is willing to back up what he says with quotes, witnesses (when he can), proof, documents and more.<br />I rated it a four for one reason- I think that sometimes the author does lower himself and whine. There were a few times when I thought- 'ok, got it, made your point, move one..' and he continued to drive the point home or whine about it. Some of it was picky little items that really had nothing to do with the idea of the story (The security of the White House and the security of documents in the White House and such issues).<br />Well worth reading.	2002-08-11

All three are witches in a positive way. They use their powers to help find lost children, heal the sick and so on.<br />In each story the person they fall in love with must learn to accept the idea of loving a true witch and in some cases the idea of loving anyone at all.<br />This is a lovely set of three stories. I enjoyed every minute of reading these stories. It is one I will come back and reread again and again. I particularly like how through out the stories, you get to remeet the characters and see their lives progress as characters from previous stories have children and so on.<br />Enjoy.	2002-08-07

They were true Nora Roberts- romance, magic, a hint of mystery or some wierd problem. These are not formula romances by a long shot.<br />Truly fun to read. In the first story, Calin travels to Ireland with no real reason as to why. When he sees Brynna, he realizes why he came. As they learn to work together and as they fall in love they face many problems that most couple don't face.<br />The second story, which was my favorite of the three, Conal is a loner and likes it that way until Allena gets lost and shows up at his home. An enjoyable story with magic and love and more.<br />The third story was my least favorite of the three, but any Nora Roberts book at it's worst is better than many romance books at their best. Kayleen must learn to love a man who can only have her 'in dreams' and how to conquer this unusual problem.<br />Enjoy.	2002-08-07

I have made many recipes in this book and they are all excellent. In fact, this is a book I refer to often when planning my monthly menu.<br />I particularly like the ideas and little comments that accompany many of the recipes. They are uplifting and gentle, yet they don't distract from the recipes. Even the little drawings are nice.

He needs to move out of the home. His whining overshadows much of the book. The plot is fast paced though and it is an enjoyable read. Tom, Julian and Marla add to the book and help detract from Arch.<br />Goldy Schulz is a caterer and while doing her job she stumbles across dead bodies and mysteries. In this one, the person who hired her is found dead with her knife in him. When he fails a polygraph, Goldy is forced to detect again the true cause of the murder and the true murderer.<br />As always the recipes are delicious and the menus she whips up for various catering jobs sound wonderful.<br />It is an enjoyable book. I'm sure those with teens can better relate to the whining boy in the book. However, it is still an enjoyable book.	2002-07-24

I have enjoyed Miss Rimmer's books about the Bravo family. I enjoy being able to catch up on other family members I have read about in previous books.<br />Melinda Bravo is trying to be the independant daughter of a mother and father who just want to see her married (or living with) someone of interest (such as an artist, a poet etc.) While trying to make a living selling lingerie she literally runs into Cole Yuma. Annie Cole's sister, who has her own problems, works hard to push them together. There is a happy ending for everyone and it's a lovely story.<br />Well worth the read.<br />Enjoy.	2002-07-12
1477627:US	52683195	R22VJG2CF3CIRE	0373484100	216534554	Night Tales: Night Shift/ Night Shadow/ Nightshade/ Night Smoke	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Not up to her usual standards.	This is a set of four stories about the same family.  Night Shift is about Boyd Fletcher and a lovely DJ who is having stalker problems, it is probably my favorite of the four. In Night Shadow Boyd's sister-in-law Deborah O'Roarke is falling in love with a man who has an amazing secret. Nightshade is about Boyd's partner Thea . Night Smoke is the story about Boyd's sister Natalie Fletcher, arson and the sexy fireman who helps find the arsonist.<br />As is typical with Nora Roberts series, each story can stand on it's own. However, I like the fact that you can revisit old characters and catch up on their lives through Nora Roberts other books. There is a follow up to these four stories about Boyd's daugther and a private investegator. It is a great story and out of the five stories, my favorite.<br />I typically rate Nora Roberts stories with fives. However, this one has a four. I found this a little bit too 'off the wall' for my tastes. The idea that some man can become invisible at will was just to wild. I think that the connection being made in other reviews between books written by Nora Roberts under the name JD Robb is correct. These books have another world/futeristic type feel to them. The cities are darker, more evil, particularly in Night Shadow. The JD Robb books are some that I do not enjoy and I'm dissapointed to see that leaking over into the Nora Roberts romance books.<br />However, having said that, let me stress that I find any Nora Roberts book to be above and beyond the normal romance book  and worth reading.	2002-07-12
1477634:US	52683195	R2Z8SWPTSLI0TG	0312974256	394302937	Welcome to Temptation	Books	3	4	13	N	Y	Not to my taste	First the positive: There were some funny scenes in this book. The autopsy scene was funny as was it funny to read about the police trying to find out the truth about the dead man. The water tower was funny. I also liked the whole idea of the book. Sophie and her sister are wedding photographers, daughters of a con man. Sophie is the 'mother' in the relationship having raised her sister and her brother. They go to Temptation to help a friend and make a video that shows their friend can still make movies. What begins as a short video ends up as porn, maybe, but maybe not. In the mean time temptation is passing laws that says no porn may be filmed in Temptation while Sophie and the mayor are getting to know each other.<br />Second the negative: The book wasn't that funny to make up for the lack of morals and sad state affairs in this book. There were no morals at all in any of the characters, there was not strength in any of the characters in this book. Sophie was in the position she was because she could not say no to her siblings. The mayor had a daughter that he had from a girlfriend who he married because she got pregnant because she thought he was rich. And so on. This book was way too slutty for my tastes. The whole book revolved around who was getting sex, how they were getting it, and who with. Husbands and wives were having affairs, the only reason for being so low is that the person they were sleeping with was famous. Mothers were trying to pay off girlfriends to leave town.  And on and on.<br />Over all I just found the whole book depressing with a few chuckles thrown in as it's saving grace. I thought the idea of the story was great, but I believe it could have been better written.	2002-07-12

I am not sure how the author was able to figure out the order in which this person traveled through the Americas. However, that being beside the point, what is fascinating is that there are so many legends and stories of a person who walked the Americas. Someone who could heal and teach and believed in peace and love. <br />The similarities to Christ as fascinating. Particularly when you consider the Book of Mormon, another testiment in Christ, indicates that yes, Christ did walk and teach the people who lived here. <br />Even more amazing is that these stories in this book are only the tip of the ice berg so to speak- many of the stories refer to other stories that are about this man who walked and taught over here. <br />It is my understanding that there are stories among the Indians of floods that covered the Earth and other stories that are similar to the Bible Stories. So this really shouldn't be such a big surprise. <br />This is one book I'm not sorry I bought and read.	2002-07-08

Mr. Keel tells the reader when he's scared, looking for more information or not sure what he's seeing. I think he's very up front and honest.<br />There is much I think that can be learned by Mr. Keel's experiences and interviews. Men In Black, Ufo's, and strange sounds are all in this book. Monsters and mysteries that prove we don't know everything on this Earth and in this universe yet.<br />My one big complaint and why it's rated a four rather than a five is that many times Mr. Keel gets off track in his writing. This leaves the reader a bit confused and forced to back track at times. Further, I find many times I would have been going back to find more information and it doesn't seem he does that, at least not in the book. This is frustrating for me. I'd like more information, more about the interviews he conducted etc.<br />Not a bad book over all. Just a few not so positive thoughts on it. I enjoyed it and read it in about two days.<br />Enjoy.	2002-07-06

This book is an excellent reference. It gives step by step directions for conducting surveys, writing a mini plan, special ordinance for special issues (such as signs) and more. There are charts and graphs and pictures that help clarify the text.<br />I am sure that by the size of it and the way it reads this is a text book for a college class somewhere. IT does read a little bit dry, but I'm not sure how much more exciting you can get with law, legalities, procedures and such.<br />Good information.	2002-07-06

This is a collection of the first ten issues of the World Explorer Magazine. (WEX for short.) There are articles about pterodactyls, caves in Arizona, missing cities, interesting trips and more. There are some little funny tidbits in among all of this- jokes, postcards from readers, cartoons and Riply's Believe it or Not type information.<br />This is an interesting book/collection of magazines.<br />My two complaints- the book is very big in size and it makes it difficult for some intersting late night reading. Two- the reproduction quality is poor- this makes it difficult to look at already poor quality photos.<br />What an interesting book that looks at the off beat, far off, interesting and fun.	2002-07-05

I like how Ms. Rimmer interweaves characters from other books into this one. However, even though it's part of a series, it can stand alone and is very good.<br />Jonas is rich and handsome. He has taken his father's millions and turned them into billions. He lives in a mansion with his mother, and  Mandy a baby sister his mother adopted. Everything is just perfect except for the constant shadow of what happened to his baby brother who was kidnapped when Jonas was six (or so).<br />When his mother dies he's shocked to learn he will only get custody of Mandy if agrees to marry a friend of his mother's. An unpredictable, full of fun, hard working lady named Emma.<br />Jonas isn't happy and neither is Emma. Jonas tries to bully her into marrying him and then tries to buy her and finally she does it because it's what his mother wanted- not for the money or out of fear.<br />Emma and Jonas decide to try to find his brother. Out of this forced marriage and search for the missing baby comes love.<br />Excellent.<br />Enjoy.	2002-07-05

However, each book can stand unto itself. I like how Ms. Rimmer uses characters from other books in each book of this Bravo family series. Very good.<br />This book is excellent.<br />Marsh ran off 10 years ago as a young man. He left his abusive father and the town he grew up in behind with no regrets. The one regret he had was he left his girlfriend Tory. She was 16 at the time and he felt he was doing the best thing for her.<br />Ten years later his father is dying and asks Marsh to come back. Marsh returns only to find out he's the father of a young girl. Tory was pregnant and he hadn't known. As he works to clear up his father's 'estate', they slowly learn they still love each other. The agreement? If she is pregnant then she will marry him.<br />Excellent Book.<br />Enjoy	2002-07-05

This board book is changed from the original. I agree, the original one is much better in that it's longer and has more of the wild wacky words we associate with Dr. Suess books. However, that doesn't make this board book bad. IN fact, I think it is well done.<br />The fact that the text is shortened works well in my opinion. Most babies don't really have the attention span to sit for a longer book. The fact that this book is a little bit shorter makes it easier to read to a wiggly year old baby.<br />The pictures are cute and has the wacky characters we associate with Dr. Suess books. The text is just fine and if you hadn't read the original, you wouldn't really know there was much missing in terms of text.<br />For a young child, board books are great and reading to a baby and young child is important. I think it is more important that you read to your child rather than worry about what has changed from the original. My son who is three loved this book and now my daughter who is 15 months is enjoying it.<br />Enjoy.	2002-07-03

I have just discovered Christine Rimmer and the Bravo Family books. I was more than pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed all of the books I have read so far.<br />This one, however, was not up to the same quality of all of the others. I found that it was a little bit silly at times and that I really didn't connect with the characters as I have in her other books.<br />I certainly enjoyed it and if I had not been reading her other books, I don't know that I would be as unhappy with this one. I think I just noticed this one is not up to par because I'm reading them close together. Hence a four rather than a five or a lower score.<br />This is about a girl who has a baby by a man who didn't want it. Soon after the man dies and the parents of this man want the baby for themselves. In order to fight the attorneys and have a good argument for keeping the baby, she marries her best friend. Her best friend Dekker. He was the missing Bravo Baby read about in other books. And guess what? HE's not just the missing baby and the best friend to her, but he's rich. So he can help her.<br />A marriage of convenience quickly turns to love. A very nice ending with everyone happy.<br />It was nice reading about the other Bravo's in this book. I like how Ms. Rimmer so carefully entertwines characters from her other books into this book.<br />Enjoy.	2002-06-26
1497439:US	52683195	R1XL153LYORRUI	0312265859	52382288	Hard Eight (Stephanie Plum)	Books	5	0	5	N	Y	As always - FUNNY	This book again just answers the questions, why is Evanovich one of my favorite authors? She's funny and yet still realistic in many ways. She keeps the motion moving in her books and the tension tight when it needs to be. Superb as always. She does an excellent job of keeping all the characters straight in the book which makes it an easy read despite having a lot of characters.<br />I think there a tendency in people who read one author to begin to say, 'wait, she's not as funny as she used to be....' 'this isn't as good as the first one'. I think many times we are comparing our excitement at finding a new author who is excellent to now when we are again on the never ending quest for a new author and this one isn't new anymore. It's unfortunate for authors that this happens.<br />I can honestly say that Janet Evanovich novels have not grown old and Number 8 is as good as all the others before it. I have no reason to expect number 9, 10, and so on won't be just as great.<br />I thought this was just right in line with her other novels. It is not often you can laugh at lawyers, hot sex, blown up cars, and clothes dryers in one book.<br />I thought Ranger was as sexy as ever and the tension between them was oh so good. I thought the relationship between her and Morrelli was very interesting. I would have like more of Grandma. I just laugh and laugh at the Grandma. But Lula is a hoot as always, even in times of stress. I particularly like how she refers to other events in other novels and brings the reader up to speed at times about who a character is or how they came into her life. All of this and more keeps me anxious for book 9, 10 and so on.<br />The main story line this time, I think, held more of a realistic story to it- a woman trying to make ends meet, a yucky husband (ex now) and stretched a bit with the really scary bad guy. The whole story line is good.<br />Enjoy.	2002-06-26

Max and Lola are on a boat, alone, together and the boat wires are melted. Throw in an island, some drug running men, and a yippy dog and you have an exciting story.<br />I felt the characters were believable and Max was certainly a fantasy man with all the flaws and character you could ask for. I particularly liked Lola. She was smart and interesting and fun and slightly dotty. Very fun.<br />My only comment, I'd rate this a low five or a high four. I didn't think it was as steamy as advertised.	2002-06-21

There are some wonderful combinations such as orange and chocolate scones. The directions are easy, the ingredients are usually common items that are easy to find and all the recipes I have tried turned out yummy.<br />Although it is a small book, in size, it is not small in yumminess or easiness.

She puts her grandaughter Julia, a lawyer, in charge of Blooms, famous deli in NY. Julia doesn't know about managing a deli, she doesn't know about types of olives or even if this is what she wants to do. But do it she does.<br />While her Uncle Jay works at undermining her, her mother tries to be the president of Blooms, and a reporter looks for problems. Julia does her best to hold it all together.<br />Slowly she finds out who is stealing the bagels, introduces her sister to a true love, and begins managing Blooms. And, all the while, she falls in love herself.<br />What a wonderful romance. Light, fun, a family you can believe in, and love. Using food to bring people together is not new, however, this has the feeling of newness and originality. The zany characters in this novel only make it that much more fun- Uncle Jay the computer man, the bagel counter man, a poet writing sister, a cousin who is a director of sorts, a domineering grandmother and more.<br />Although this is the first book I've read by this author, it won't be the last. This was a joy from beginning to end. Well worth reading.<br />Enjoy.	2002-06-17

They enjoy the rythm of the words. The words and the text match which makes reading this book that much more enjoyable.

Three Men, Three Stories.<br />This book is a little bit different than many traditional contemporary romances. Three men who are cousins, who have grown up together and have had their share of problems each make the decision to get married, each for a different reason. Three men end up falling in love with their wives.<br />Cash marries because he got young Abbie pregnant. Abbie is happy and content and only wants her husband to love her. Soon he realizes he does love her and eventually through learning to communicate, they manage to make a family.<br />Nate must work through a painful past in order to see the love that his wife has for him.<br />And, Zach must give his wife the time she needs to realize she does love him and he must learn to trust her.<br />All three stories sound simple the way I describe them. However, they are not simple. They are truly lovely stories of pain, heart ache, trust, communication, love, family and more.<br />This was a first novel for me by this author, however, it certainly won't be the last. These books are well written, the setting is gorgeous, the love of the land and the love each couples learns to feel is believable. The characters are strong and yet weak at the same time, similar to real life. Lovely books.<br />Enjoy.	2002-06-03

And thus begins the story.<br />The side characters are funny. I laughed at the dog, the meddling ex mother in law and the rest of the additional characters. They only added to the story rather than distracting from it. The hero was a nice guy who knew how to do his job (Police Chief). The Jillian was just as realistic to me... learning to stand on her own after a divorce, learning how to stand up to her ex, and learning how to be herself.<br />This is not a book that requires deep thinking nor does it have a life changing lesson. But that only makes in more enjoyable in my opinion. It fits in well for a day at the park while the kids play, an afternoon read while the kids nap, etc.<br />Enjoy.	2002-06-01

I love being able to take a book and do activities that jump off of the book pages. My almost three year old son does too.<br />The story is simple and fun. The repetitive nature of this book makes it great for pre readers. With a little bit of practice your child can memorize the book to 'read' it to others.

The spider is too busy spinning her web. Adorable.<br />Several things make this book a true winner. First the repitition. The repitition is an excellent way for pre-readers and early reader to learn to read. (A whole language approach, but it gives kids some success.) Second, the tactile approach- as the spider spins her web you can feel the strings of the web and the fly that is buzzing around. This is a fun book to read and my son loves to touch the pages. The illustrations are adorable.<br />When I taught Kindergarten I always had a unit worked up around this book. There are so many creative and fun things you can do for activities and learning with this book. Now that I'm at home with my kiddos, we still do many of these fun things after we read this book. We made spiderwebs out of glue on black paper.<br />Enjoy.	2002-05-21

This book is wonderful. We would make bread and eat toast and jam, we'd jump rope to the book rhymes, we'd find rhyming words and more. Now that I'm a mom- this book is still a favorite of mine. Now, my son and I do fun things- the other day, he helped me make jam after we read this book.<br />This book is a must have in my opinion. The rythm is catchy and fun. The illustrations are adorable. Children like this book. I've never known a child to not like this book.<br />Enjoy.	2002-05-21

Should be Required Reading	Everyone who has something to do with children should read this book: Educators, parents, counselors and employers.<br />This is not a book about solutions- This is a book about recognizing the problem. As we know, recognizing the problem is the first step to correcting the situation.<br />This is a series of essays and speaches the author has written about education in the United States. Mr. Gatto is an award winning teacher who has taken the brave step of stating what he sees wrong with education. As only someone who has worked in the system for so long can really see the problems, he not only sees the problems, he shares them with the rest of the nation.<br />As a teacher who has quit to stay at home with my children, I agree whole heartedly with Mr. Gatto. As a teacher who has vowed to home school, I agree with Mr. Gatto.<br />Education does what it was set up to do- to teach the masses, to tame the unruly individual thinkers, and more. Mr. Gatto's seven lessons that school teaches is exactly on target. Unfortunately.<br />How do we change the education system? It will take a shift of thinking across the nation. This book is just a small drop in the tidal wave of events that needs to happen. Each person reading this book and acting on it only adds to the rising wave of education reform.<br />Truly a well thought out book written by a brave man who was willing to put his job and living on the line for what he believes.	2002-05-19

Lukas Kasha is a young man who claims the title of the town laze- when a magician sends him to another land and he's the new king of this land. Lukas Kasha much grow up, learn to govern, and stick to his morals in a kingdom of very few morals. (Killing is the norm for many of the people in this new land.) The plot is fast paced and the characters are fun. It is easy to get swept up in reading this book and loose all sence of time. Wonderful. I particularly liked the lessons Lukas learns during his adventure and how he takes them right away and puts them into place in his life. I also liked how he tried to do right by people even though encouraged not to and the easier way would be to not help the people he did help. Truly a great lesson in how everything that you put out, you get back ten fold.<br />Enjoy.	2002-05-17

Vesper Holly is a young woman who is in the care of a couple - Brinnie and his wife Mary are friends of her deceased parents. Vesper is headstrong, courageous, daring, fun, exciting, smart and talented.<br />In this book her guardians are invited to a diamond jubilee and Vesper convinces them to go. So off they go only to run into their old nemisis who has tried to kill them in previous adventures. This time is no different. A kidnapping, traveling with gypsies, a bomb, and many other exciting things happen.<br />What an excellent book. I learned a little bit while I read this book and I totally enjoyed the read.<br />Enjoy.	2002-05-17

These cookbooks you can sit around and read and enjoy. I have laughed out loud at the three cookbooks I have by this author.<br />This cookbook is not full of low fat recipes. It doesn't claim to be the easiest recipes. It has the best of the best recipes. IF they are high in fat or take some time to prepare, this cookbook promises they are worth the effort. So far, I agree. Everything I have made out of these two (Beat This and Beat That) has been great. And I'd say most of the recipes are not time consuming, nor do they require exotic ingredients.<br />Excellent. Enjoy.	2002-05-13

One of my favorites	This is the type of cookbook you can sit around and read and really enjoy. It's funny. The directions are easy and very few recipes call for anything exotic. These are not the most low fat recipes or the most easiest recipes- but the best of the best recipes. But, that doesn't mean the meals are all hard or difficult to make, just that if they are a little bit time consuming, it promises to be worth the time. A fun read and great recipes. Enjoy	2002-05-13

The pictures are funny and my little toddler laughs everytime we read this book.<br />The illustrations are charming. You can tell the gorilla is just the trouble maker of the bunch from page one because his facial expressions are so expressive.<br />Very Cute and well worth the money.

The medical section was thumbed through I don't know how many times in search of information on green poop and fevers. There is a lot of information about attachment parenting. It was well worth reading. I took some of the information and suggestions out of this book and mixed it with my beliefs and came up with something that worked for my husband nad myself. I am not sorry I read this book. It was a very useful, very informative book.	2002-05-09

Her fiance has left her, her aunt has died, and her substitute gaurdian angel pops in and out at will. BUT- her aunt's death is suspicious and with the help of her gaurdian angel Mary George Murphy manages to find an old friend, make new friends, and solve the murder of her aunt. Very interesting.<br />This is a nice little book to cozy up to and enjoy when you need a little chuckle. I enjoyed it.	2002-05-04

It seems like that at least) recipes for clay, paint, glue and more in there. It is an excellent book. I turn to this book whenever I need playdough. I turn to this book when I want to make paper mache and when I want to make fingerpaints, I turn to this book. This is a fantastic resource. Every kindergarten, pre-k teacher should have this on their personal shelves.<br />Enjoy.	2002-05-02

Series)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Great Resource	I would rate this book a low five or a high four. The reason is that the drawers are big and cluttery and sometimes the fonts they use are big and cluttery and that makes it hard for me to concentrate on the page and read the activity. Having said that though- this is an excellent book.<br />The ideas are easy to impliment, usually using around the house supplies. Some of them are messy and some of them are not. There is a wide range of activities that will appeal to a wide range of youngsters, cooking, music, mobiles, bugs and more are included in here.<br />The books says it is directed towards 6- 12 years old. I'd say this is about right. However, some of the activities would be too simple for six year olds and might work well in a kindergarten classroom.<br />Enjoy	2002-05-02

The reason being that the illustrations in this book are big and cluttery and sometimes the fonts used are big and cluttery. I find I have a hard time reading the directions for the activity because my eye is roving around the page so much. Maybe others don't have this problem?<br />Otherwise this is an excellent book full of great ideas for how to make the weekends fun. There are a wide range of activities that will appeal to a wide range of kiddos: Music, planting, magic and rainy day activities. Glass chimes, clay recipes, cooking ideas, pretend play and science are all included in this book. Some require more than one person or mom's help, others are good for young kids to do on their own. Excellent resource book for when you need an idea fast. Most of the ideas use around the house supplies.<br />My only other thought is that I also have Boredom Busters by the same authors and some (NOT a lot, but a few) of the activities are repeated in both books. However there are enough differences in the two books that it might well be worth getting both books.	2002-05-02

I enjoyed reading it.<br />Rather than a book that explains what places you can visit, how to get there and what to see when you go- this is more of a journal of the authors travels. In here he tells you what he sees, what he thinks and the things he learns.<br />The author covers a wide range of thoughts from pteradactyles still living to Asians visiting Mexico to Romans in Arizona.<br />I rated this a four instead of a five for two reasons. At times the writing seems stiff and it makes it hard to wade through some sections of this book. Also, the proofreading leads a lot to be desired. Words are left out, typos and spelling errors are plenty. Enough to be a distraction at times.<br />Otherwise, it's an interesting book and well worth reading.<br />Enjoy.	2002-05-02

It was such a fascinating talk that I had to buy his book. The book is fascinating and very readable. I was not bored one second while reading this book. The author talks about the history of war, how we convince our soldiers to kill others and why they don't kill.<br />Basically he talks about how we train them through repetition and practice and dummy practices. The soldiers work through shooting others by practicing on video games, watching movies, practicing with dummies. Eventually killing seems natural.<br />This is a great book that explains very clearly why video games and violent movies are not acceptable and really shouldn't have a place in general society. I have some very strong thoughts on this now and it is due in a large part to this book.<br />Excellent. Well worth reading.	2002-04-24

It is a fun cookbook that has some wild ingredients- kangaroo being one. However, you can certainly substitute and many times the substitutes are clearly given. I would say that some of these recipes can be made with ingredients on hand, others you will need to prepare ahead for. The few items I have made from this cookbook have turned out well and the directions were easy to follow. THe pictures are lovely and only add to the book.<br />This is not the book to buy if you are trying to prepare meals in a hurry and on the fly. There are a lot of books out there that will help you with that. THis is a good book to buy if you enjoy cooking and want something that is fairly simple to make (once you have all ingredients on hand) and yet have it turn out good.<br />Enjoy.	2002-04-17

There is more than one romance that blossoms in this novel and a mystery of sorts is thrown in. Truly one of Ms. Roberts' best novels yet.<br />Sophia and Tyler have known each other for their whole lives and have always maintained a friendly distance. Sophia travels and sells the wine made from the grapes that Tyler grows. However, when her grandmother reorganizes the company and forces these two to work together, sparks fly. The romance is exciting and full of heat and very believable.<br />Sophia's mother on the other hand is a very timid woman who only wanted to be a wife and a mother. When her philandering husband that she has been seperated from for many many years decides he wants a divorce, it seems life is over. However, the reorganization brings a new man into her life and a second chance at love and motherhood.<br />Murder, tainted bottles, burning buildings only add to the excitement and mystique of this book. I couldn't put it down.<br />Enjoy.	2002-04-17

What more can I say?<br />The characters are believable and well rounded out. They are far from perfect and yet they are good people. They are the type of people you would like to meet on the street. I enjoyed this book. I particularly enjoyed it because I was able to revisit with some of my favorite characters from other novels (the Stanislaski Series). In earlier novels you read about young Freddie with her crush on Nick. Only now it's years later and Freddie is grown up and ready to show this to Nick as well. With much hesitation and worry Nick soon learns she's a grown up girl who is able to take care of herself.<br />Excellent.<br />Enjoy.	2002-03-29

This is a fascinating book that is well written, logical, and easy to read. It clearly explains how the great jump in our technology happened in the last 50 or so years. IF it's true. If it's not a true book, then the author is very creative and the book is still a good read.<br />I for one do not doubt that this whole book might be based on truth. Basically the author recounts how he got a filing cabinet full of information that he had to 'farm out' to companies. The information? technology that was retrieved from a downed space craft (UFO) that crashed in Roswell. The author recounts how he helped share this information with others so that they could use it to increase our technology.<br />Fascinating.	2002-03-20

You get a book and a few little special lego pieces in this kit. The lego pieces are typical lego quality- sturdy and fairly easy to use. You follow the directions in the book and using the special lego pieces and the legos you already have at home, you can build some cool contraptions. Some are easier than others to build. However, all are doable and all live up to my expectations. Very Fun.<br />Enjoy.<br />IF you are like I am and look for toys that are quality toys that encourage creativity and exploration of the world around you, Lego toys are great. If you look for toys that have more than a button to push, lego toys are great. The toys are quality toys that can grow with your child and continually be added to to make new and exciting things.	2002-03-20

This is a very interesting book. I rated it a four instead of a five because it tends to be a bit dry at times. Basically this book is a series of essays written by people 'in the know'. For example, a news columnist writes about who owns the newspapers and who controls the news that gets written about. A researcher will write about UFO's and the freedom of information act and on and on it goes. Some of the essays are excellent with much thought put into them and many references you can turn to for more information. Other essays are just  plain silly with very little documentation to back them up. However, this is an excellent well put together book. Interesting.	2002-03-20

I bought it expecting a list of things that my child should know prior to entering Kindergarten. Instead what I got was a book that I could use to teach my child. Excellent!<br />I think it would be better with a comprehensive list of expectations and/or goals that every child should reach by the time they are through with Kindergarten. That is the teacher in my coming out.<br />I found that the social studies section was amazing. I didn't realize that kindergarten children could comprehend so much.<br />Word of Warning: This is ONLY the very basics that a child should be able to learn. This is NOT the be all end all of a kindergarten curriculum to use for homeschooling. However, it can be used as a place to jump start your learning. You will need to add more literature and poetry and math activities. However, it's a well rounded, full of information, useful book.	2002-03-18

If you were just beginning a system of organization, didn't know where to start at all, or had not read another book about organization; then this might the book for you.<br />If, however, you are like myself- fairly organized and looking for a few hints and pointers and possibly some better ideas of ways to organize, you can skip this book. Personally I suggest to my friends that they consider 'Confessions of a Happily Organized Housewife' by Deniece Schofield. (Both her books are well worth the money!)<br />So- here is my opinion: IF you have never organizined before this is a very non threatening book with some great ideas for organizing various parts of your home. The author does a great job of explaining how to sort through things for importance, how to keep a system going once it is in place, and ideas of how to organize what you do keep. I just find it a VERY BASIC book. If you are already somewhat organized in your life or have already read some books on this topic, you can probably skip this book.	2002-03-18

My son was recently diagnosed with asthma. While he doesn't have to be on an inhaler nebulizer at this time, he does hate what asthma does to him. He has to stop running and wait until his medicine starts to work. We are able to read this book and talk a little about asthma (He's 2) and about what it means for him. This book is a great one for reassuring little kids that they are ok, that others have this, and that soon they can play again.<br />The only reason I rated this a four instead of a five is that I think the text is a little stilted at times.	2002-03-14

After reading through this book and looking at the pictures I was able to make a list of things I wanted to do and the order they needed to be done. It made a huge difference for our family.<br />The pictures only add to the text and help to clarify what the author is discussing. The text is clear and easy to read. The directions are simple and informative. WELL WORTH THE MONEY!<br />I did not find this book to be overwhelming or full of too much information. Rather it was a perfect book for home owners who suffer from allergies or asthma.	2002-03-14

If you have to give a gift for a wedding you can look in here and find something with meaning that isn't expensive. You can wrap it up prettily with a lovely little card explaining the meaning of the gift and you have a much appreciated gift. I am finding that it truly is the thought and not the cost. BUT- it must have much thought and love put into it. Hence, this book. This book is like having someone already do the thinking for you on the meaning. You just need to pick out which gift you like and which meaning you want to attach to it.<br />Sure you can run out and do some of this research for yourself, but would you? Do you have the time? Would you even think of 1/2 the ideas in this book? I wouldn't have the time nor would I remember what I did research so I'd be doing the same research over and over and over.<br />If you want a small token of friendship or an inexpensive but nice wedding gift or a expensive gift that has a lot of thought put into it, this is the book to get. It is well researched, well organized and well worth the money.	2002-03-14

The results are great. I have not had a flop when using this cookbook. There are few recipes that have some exotic ingredients, but overall, most of the recipes require normal kitchen staples. This is an excellent book.<br />IT is NOT 15 minutes cooking time. It is NOT 15 minutes AFTER everything is put together. It is just about 15 minutes from start to finish (provided you are not dwadling as you cook).<br />The only thing I don't like is that everything is given in weights and grams and other measurements. This makes it a bit mroe difficult for a slow math person such as myself since I have to convert it all to typical measurements. Just a small matter really.<br />Enjoy.	2002-03-02

I went ahead and got all of them. Basically this is a book fo postcards of famous paintings. You cut them out and use them to help teach your younger children about art and artists and styles of art. You do this through a series of continually more challenging games.<br />Well worth the money.	2002-03-01

The only reason I rated this a four is that it is very wordy.<br />However, it is a great resource. I found it to be full of information I needed. I was able to turn to it for answers to almost all of my questions. This is a very matter of fact book that is based on facts, current studies and information.<br />Everything the author says is backed up with information and facts. THis makes it a very valuable book in my opinion because it is not a parenting book that is based on how this author did it, but an informative book based on all the information we know about babies and young children.<br />Well worth getting.	2002-03-01
1636774:US	52683195	R1WRKYIEI48UYJ	0962203637	560469338	Win the Whining War & Other Skirmishes: A Family Peace Plan	Books	2	11	23	N	Y	Very Basic.	This is a very basic book that tells very little in the way of raising children.<br />The main point of the book is this: Look for the positive and praise it and ignore the negative behavior.<br />For example, if your child whines when you tell him/her to clean his room you praise the fact that he picked up five of the toys without whining. Ignore the fact that the child whined while picking up the other 200 toys. The idea is that eventually the child will pick up the whole room without whining.<br />Ha- I haven't found that to be the case while teaching and I haven't found that to be the case with my children (age two and younger).<br />I think you can easily skip this book and find a more comprehensive book with more ideas that are better suited to reality.	2002-03-01

I have pulled this book out for every pregnancy. It is a great resource.<br />Each day of the pregnancy tells how many days are left until your due date, what is happening to the baby inside you and some tidbit of information. There might be a cultural type of tidbit that tells how other women in other countries give birth, prepare for their baby or recover after birth. There might be a trivia like how long whales are pregnant. There might be a diet advice or a cute quote. Whatever it is, everything included is uplifting or with just a touch of humor. Very well done.<br />This is not a book for tracking your pregnancy as in writing a little note each day to your baby. However, there are some spots for writing your thoughts, dr visits, etc. Mainly this is a book to help you learn what is going on with your body and baby during your pregnancy.<br />Wonderful.	2002-03-01

In other words, I typically would not buy this book that will convince my child that sunmaid raisins are the ones to buy. However, this is such a cute book that I bought it.<br />My son has enjoyed this book and has played with it. He pulls this book out when he thinks he needs a snack. He likes to put the raisins on the dog and then take them off and eat them.<br />Very cute. Great for eye and hand coordination.	2002-02-16

I think it is a great way to introduce children to counting by ones and counting by tens through manipulatives. And this comes from someone who doesn't like to buy into free advertising (in other words to have cheerio shoved down my child's eyes when I buy the book). But this is a great book.<br />Two thoughts- we have another cheerio book that has the place to put the cheerios as a little hole and my son likes that better. And, although the cover of this book lays flat, the pages do not. I had to put a little crease in the pages back by the spine so they would lay flat. This way my son's cheerios (or fakios) won't slip off the page.<br />Cute book though.<br />Enjoy.	2002-02-08

The text is highlighted by pictures that enhance many of this statements he makes. The author does a great job of taking information from a variety of sources to prove his points and clarify his writing.<br />My two complaints are that some of the pictures are so small that they are frustrating because you can't see much of the detail. Second, the assumption is made that you know about many of the places in this book and I don't. I had never heard of many of these places until reading this book. I would have appreciated a few maps to help clarify where some of these places are.<br />Great book. Very interesting. Enjoy.	2002-02-08

I picked up this book at the grocery store when I was desperate for something to read while visiting relatives. What a joy! Although this was my first Jan Jeffry novel, it's not my last!<br />Jane Jeffry and her friend Shelly Nowack offer some laughs while they work to solve a crime. In this case they signed up to take a gardening class when the instructor is attacked and the substitute instructor is killed. While Jane juggles house work, raising children and a gardening class, her and her friend work to solve a the murder.<br />If I could rate it a 4+ I would have done that or a 5-. Mainly because I thought the ending was a little bit abrupt. However, it was a great read and I'm buying more of her books today.<br />Enjoy.	2002-02-01

Here is what I liked about this book:<br />1- It is in an easy to read format.<br />2- It give you the science behind the ideas. For example, it<br />  talks about recent studies with smells and then provides you<br />  with some ideas that are related to our sence of smell.<br />3- The ideas and activities are fairly easy to do at home. They<br />  don't require exotic stuff or stuff that costs a fortune (for<br />  the most part). They don't require a lot of time.<br />4- The activities are fun.<br />My only concern is that if you buy this book with the idea in mind that you are raising the next genius I think you are making a mistake. However, if you want some fun, easy to do ideas that you can do at home with very little money and effort, this is a great book. If you want to understand how the brain works in your child, this is a great book. If you think your child is musically inclined and want to provide more stimulation in that area, then you might find some good ideas in this book. Just don't think you are going to buy this book and then have a genius.<br />Great Book. Enjoy!	2002-01-31

I got very sick very quick of the author talking about how he had an affair on his wife, how smart he was and what he did to hold all these very important government deals together.<br />I think that if even a part of this is true however, that this is very scary. There is a lot of information about the underhandedness of the CIA and other government officials and how much of this led to JFK's death.<br />If you can concentrate on the story and get past the self bragging, this book is very interesting and disturbing. However, for me, the constant self importance of this author got old fast.	2002-01-31

It is well written.<br />The chapters are devided into areas of New Mexico. In each chapter there is a little bit about the history of that area, places to visit and more information about other nearby areas.<br />Having been to many of the areas that are discussed in this book, I found the description on target and the suggestions of places to visit good. I particularly liked the history of the area with directions to see some of the historical spots in each area.<br />Very nice. Well worth the money. This book will join me in the car as we go on our trips. It will join the RoadSide History of New Mexico as one of our invaluable, must keep in the car resources.<br />Enjoy.	2002-01-27

He discusses what rock art means and refers you to other well written books. He also provides lists of emergency equipment, camping equipment and more that you should consider taking as you begin looking at rock art.<br />In the next chapters he tells where to go to see rock art. He also instructs the reader about the expected behavior, tours to take, and more.<br />There are directions for taking pictures of rock art and explanations of clothes to wear, weather, and even a few recipes for crockpot cooking... so you can cook while you are looking and come home to a nice meal. Great!<br />This is a very exciting book. It made me want to jump out of my seat and go looking. The pictures are nice. His enthusiasm is catching and the format is easy to understand.

It has stories from other families who homeschool about how they handled various situation. It has resources and confidence boosters and ideas.<br />I think this would be a great book for those who are just starting out in homeschooling and have a lot of questions about homeschooling the younger children. Another book I would suggest would be the The Big Book of Home Learning by Mary Pride.<br />My only problem with this book was that I thought I'd get more along the line of checklists of what your child should know when. Or more importanly what order some of these important skills should be taught in; for example, children who know their shapes tend to do well with recognizing letters which reads to reading. I thought this book was lacking in this type of important information.<br />In fact, many of the books I have been reading as I begin homeschooling my preschool child are lacking in this information. If anyone has any suggestions of where I can find that info, email me.<br /> If I were just starting to homeschool and I had a young child at home I suggest you consider buying this book.	2002-01-14

This is a fascinating read.<br />The idea behind this book is that John Douglas and Mark Olshanker look at some of the unsolved cases through out history that have continued to be of interest to the public. Through the evidence and accounts of each crime, they try to apply the FBI behavioral science that has been developed since these crimes as a way to 'solve' each crime.<br />Beginning with Jack the Ripper and ending with the Jon Benet-Ramsey murder with a wide variety of unsolved, famous crimes in between this book is just plain fascinating. They begin with a description of the crime, the crime scene and the people involved. Then they begin to explain and catagorize what they can learn from the known facts on hand. They explore possible solutions that have been provided by other authors and try to decide if these solutions fit the crime through a behavioral science point of view. They then provide what they think might be the appropriate solution.<br />One thing I appreciated about this book was that these authors constantly stress that they can not prove their solution is correct, only that it fits what they know to be facts and the behavior science views. They do not belittle other authors or police, in fact, they are constantly praising the good job the police have done in each case. The stress that this is an exact science at best due to it being a behavioral science and a people science.<br />Another thing I appreciated about this book was that it was peppered with a variety of cases that the author had personally worked on and stories of criminal the author had personally interviewed. Rather than being distracting, these short stories only support his theories and go a long ways to explaining exactly what the authors are talking about.<br />I rated this a four mainly for one reason: I find that many of the sentences are long and convoluted. I find that I have to go back to reread a sentence at times to be sure I understand what the sentence was saying. Maybe others won't find this to be an issue, but it occurs just often enough that it disturbs me.<br />Overall, this is a very fascinating read.Maybe others won't find this to be an issue, but it occurs just often enough that it disturbs me. <br />Overall, this is a very fascinating read.	2001-12-30

The wide variety of recipes and types of food that you can make with boiling is fascinating. I never expected to be able to cook so much with just a pot (or two) and a stove top. Very few of the recipes require anything exotic so most of the ingredients are on hand when you are ready to whip up something good. The directions are clear and easy to follow. The meals are fairly easy to make and come out tasting great!<br />If you are looking for a cookbook that has easy to make meals with a minimum of fuss, this is a good cookbook to consider.

I was not dissapointed.<br />The continuation of the characters in previous novels is something I particularly enjoy. However, even though the characters from previous novels are used, this book can stand alone.<br />I read the previous reviews and many of them already explain the plot, so what more can I say. The plot is well written and very exciting. Although the end left room for another novel, it didn't leave you hanging.<br />I gave this a four only because I think that it is not 'as good' as his previous novels. However, just because it's not as good as his other novels does not mean it's not good. I enjoyed this book.<br />Enjoy!	2001-12-29

The pictures are very nostalgic, reminding me of the older books I have inherited from my grandmother. I have spent a long time just looking at the pictures. This is one of the neatest aspects of this book.<br />Some of the classic fairy tales, poems and rhymes are included in this book. Very nice. This would be a great resource for a grandmother who doesn't want a lot of books on her shelf or doesn't want a lot of childrens books hanging around.<br />My one complaint about this book is that in some ways it's the type of book that you love at first sight but have a hard time really using. I say that because there are so many varied things in it- recipes, poems mom and poems for kids, quotes, stories for kids and for mom, etc. I am sure that I will never use the recipes because this book will sit on my shelf in my room to use when my son climbs into bed with me in the morning.. I'll forget about the recipes. IF I kept this in the kitchen, I'd never sit down and read the quotes etc.<br />However, it's a lovely book with a nice collection of a variey of readings- poetry, rhymes, quotes, songs, stories, finger games, and more. This would be a nice gift for a baby shower or a mother's day present. I am not sure I would have picked  it up for myself, mainly because I have so many books of quotes, recipe books and children's books that the items in this book are most likely repeated elsewhere.	2001-12-28

There are very few of her books that I have not enjoyed. This book is right up there with the rest of her books. The whole series is great!<br />Max is very bookish and smart... but that doesn't mean he is not sexy and nice and strong as well. Max is on a boat thinking he is doing a good job and helping a man as well... when he overhears that he's doing something not right he jumps off the boat and is rescued by Lilah. Fantastic. Lilah is strong and believable as woman who finds herself falling in love. Max begins working with Lilah and her family helping them to try to find the Calhoun Emeralds.<br />In the next story Holt is another exciting male. He has always thought that this family looked down on his family. When he is asked to help he begins by being prickly. However, eventually he begins to help search for the Calhoun Emeralds. Suzannah, the girl he considered the most uppity, turns out to be not so uppity. As they explore their feelings for each other, the search for the emeralds continues. To top it all off, the story of the ghost and the diamonds are combined to end up in an exciting conclusion.<br />Enjoy!	2001-12-27

A great book!<br />Every number rhyme I know is in this book and then some. Many of the classics are in here; One Potato, Two Potato and Ten In a Bed to name a few. There are many number rhymes I didn't know in here as well.<br />The illustrations are bright and cheerful.<br />Two things I particularly like about this book:<br />  One, the actions to the finger rhymes are not described in this book.<br />  I know many people would like to see these actions written out so they know what to do while reading this book to their child. However, it has been my experience that a. your child knows you are not reading those words and wants you to which only takes away from the book. b. even if you don't act out the rhymes the book and rhymes are just as fun and c. you can't have a kid in your lap and act out the rhymes anyways. d. books that try to explain the finger action that matches the rhyme only serves as a distraction since you can't read both the rhyme and the directions at once.<br />  The other thing I particularly like about this book is that it does not repeat each stanza of the rhymes. For example, it will give you the first verse and the last verse with the note after the first verse to continue until you reach one (such as Ten in a Bed... it assumes you can repeat the first verse until you count down to one and then provides the last verse.)<br />Great book!<br />A lot of fun!	2001-12-27

On one hand I found it could almost have been me. On the other hand, I found it to be very depressing and not about me at all.<br />As Nan turns fifty she begins a road trip and a self discovery trip. Along the way she writes letters to husband about what she learns about herself.<br />The first page begins the descent into depressing in my opinion. In her letter to her husband she begins by telling him why she keeps a pretty rock by her bed; not because she likes the color (although she does) but because she can envision a world outside her window. She can hold her rock and know there are other rocks out there in other places.<br />I guess what I find just sad about this book is that Nan feels this urge to relearn who she is by herself while still keeping her husband informed of this experience. I would rather take that path with my husband. I found it sad that she didn't share some of the things she is telling him in her letters with him many years earlier. A previous reviewer used the word victim and I would tend to agree with this comment.<br />However, if Nan turned fifty and she had been talking with her husband all along, there wouldn't be a book. And that I think, is the moral of the story to some extent. I can imagine her husband reading these letters and going along his lonely life and thinking 'how did I miss that?' and 'why didn't she tell me?' and 'where did I go wrong that she could share that with me?' Very sad.<br />This could almost be me to some degree. I think it could be every woman to some degree. We all get busy doing the dishes, raising the kids and living day to day that we forget the bigger issues and we forget the living life daily and we forget to have the important conversations.<br />This would be a good book for a book club to read and discuss I think. I also think someone who is older than me, with older kids than me might find this a more worthwhile book.  However, I don't know that I'd suggest any of my friends read it. The main reason I rated it higher than a one star (which was my first inclination) was that it really does have some good morals and life lessons woven in this book.uggest any of my friends read it.

I particularly like the father who lets them in the house after they have been out trick or treating (very funny) and the costumes that everyone wears are great!<br />It's adorable and it came from outerspace and it should be on your bookshelves.	2001-12-27

I understand that this is her first in this series. That may explain why the book just wasn't a great one?!<br />The Henrie O mysteries are very different from the Annie and Max Darling mysteries. Henrie O is typically a strong woman who has lived through some tough times. She is able to be a stand up type of woman for those in trouble.<br />In this book however, I just remember thinking several times through out the book: What? or You have got to be kidding? or For Heaven's Sake... It just didn't click together. Much of what occured in this book just seemed so not real. For an author who writes Henrie O books that are fairly well grounded, this book was a dissapointment.<br />Although I might read this book again because I am generally a Hart fan, I don't know that I'd suggest it to many other people. I would suggest a different Henrie O story however.	2001-12-24

I thought they were all fairly realistic, considering the wild situation the characters are in. The characters were well developed. The women were strong and the men were interesting. Great!<br />Having said that, this book is my least favorite in the series. I thought that it was just a little bit too pat, particularly the ending. I kind of felt that it ended suddenly. However, just because it's not as good as the others doesn't mean that it is not good.<br />Enjoy! I did. I thought that Melinda was a strong woman who knew how to be soft and vulnerable. I thought that Clay did a very good job of learning what was important in life. I enjoyed reading about their predicament as well.	2001-12-24

After all I am going to say about this book, you will find it hard to believe that I did enjoy this book. However, I did enjoy it. I like to read these easy to read romance books. They refresh my belief in love and are always uplifting. I like books that end happy.<br />However, having said that, this book has a lot of turmoil. Her parents are dead and she's greiving for a dead husband. Her best friend has had two fiancees die. The man who moves in next door is grieving for his dead daughter and worries about other children getting hurt to an extreme degree. I just felt that there was just too much turmoil and angst.<br />However, I liked the spunky Beth and enjoyed her fairly upbeat view of life. I think she finally does have a little bit of a breakdown that is very realistic. Logan, the main man, is a nice neighbor. If he didn't have the attitude he'd be the kind of man I'd lust after.<br />That is the one thing that I think saves this book- that despite both of their problems and his attitude they come together to find love and healing. Thus, it's a four instead of something lower.<br />Enjoy.	2001-12-24

Sam is a photographer that travels all over the world and generally gives into his wanderlust as he goes through life. Laura is a traditional girl who wants a family and home.<br />Recently divorced, Sam gives custody of their baby girl to his wife. After kissing the baby goodbye, he heads off to his latest assignment. Only to discover that there is a baby in the backseat, his.<br />Laura is working hard to stay on her property and fight the man who wants to buy it and turn it into a dump. She is suspicious of the man who runs off the road and into her water tower, until she sees he has a baby.<br />Laura takes the man and his baby in, while he waits for a replacement car. During the next few days, which turn into weeks, Laura and Sam begin to fall in love. Wonderful.<br />I thought the characters were believable. I enjoyed the story line and overall thought the story was great. However, I there were a few things that bothered me. Sam, who only saw his baby twice, was more than happy to have the baby left in his care and had very little problems falling into the fatherhood roll. I found that a little bit difficult to believe. A few more fears and thoughts would have only added a little bit of reality to a good book. Furthermore, I felt the end was a little bit forced. I would have appreciated a little bit more drawn out ending.<br />Overall, I'm not sorry I read this book. I'd suggest my mother or my good friend read it. I enjoyed it.	2001-12-24

I liked Henrie O. She is a strong character who can face her fears and do what needs to be done. In this case, she needs to begin to solve the mystery of her husband's death. So it's off to Hawaii to meet one of her husband's old friends, who is also a lady and thus begins her experience.<br />This is not like the Carolyn Hart mystery series Death on Demand. The characters are very different and the mystery a bit more dark. Also, she doesn't put in all the references to other mystery novels as she does in her Death on Demand books.<br />Enjoy.	2001-12-15

This is an excellent book.<br />Henrie O is a strong woman. She's not afraid to do what she thinks needs to be done. Her friend's son is in trouble and she takes on the role of aunt when it looks like he might have murdered his wife. I like that she doesn't spend a lot of time agonizing over the decisions she makes, she makes them and goes forward. In this case, she decides to do what she can to help the young man whose wife was murdered.<br />As she begins looking at the people who might have wanted Patty Kay dead, she is never sure if it wasn't Craig, the young man who might have killed his wife. She is similar to Miss Marple in that she considers the people involved, their emotions, and their motivations. However, Henrie O isn't above going out and doing a little sluething on her own as well.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this book bunches.<br />The Henrie O series is very different from the Death on Demand series although they are both written by the same author. Although they are different, they are both great series with a lot to offer a reader.	2001-12-15

What a great idea! My son (age 2) still loves this book and now he loves sharing it with his little sister (9 months). He helps her feel the sticky bugs and tells her 'soft' on the velvety bugs. What a simple idea that makes for a lot of fun.<br />I like books that you can build on. I like the fact that we talk about how my new Christmas dress feels like his velvety bug or the lace on my daughters collar is the same as the lace in the book only a different color.<br />Great.	2001-12-15

I agree with other reviewers that this is not her best work to date. There are other Death on Demand mysteries out there that are much more enjoyable. However, this is still an enjoyable read.<br />Annie is a typical woman running her own business. She has many problems of her own and many issues she is working out for herself through out this series. Max is a rich man who doesn't need to work, but who loves Annie enough to do what she would like him to do. (To a degree!) While they work out their own lives together, they also happen to solve mysteries.<br />The setting is nice and the characters are fun. The plot is convoluted. I enjoyed this book, but did find it hard to follow everything that was going on at times.<br />Enjoy.	2001-12-15

I enjoy the Carolyn Hart mysteries, particularly the ones about Max and Annie.<br />Annie is a normal, average every day person with her own set of problems who just happens to solve murders. Max is a rich guy who loves Annie enough to do the things she asks (like work!)<br />This mystery is enjoyable. One of the things about reading the Max and Annie stories is you walk off with a lot of other titles that might be fun to read, as Annie is always talking about other mystery books. This book is no exception. As an AC fan I enjoyed the book and it's mystery. I found the end to be particularly satisfying.<br />Enjoy.	2001-12-15

However, they are worth the time to read them. I have enjoyed everyone I've read. This book was no exception.<br />Henrie O is a strong female who has not yet let go of her old reporting attitude although now she's a college prof. She encourages one of her young students, Maggie, to dig deeper into an old mystery of three murders. Maggie begins to do that and ends up dead. Henrie O decides that maybe it was her fault, that she pushed Maggie into the killers path. So picking up the path, Henrie O tries to figure out who killed Maggie and why.<br />All of the Henrie O novels begin with a short introductory type of chapter but quickly develop into a great mystery. The characters are well thought out.<br />These Henrie O books are very different from the Death on Demand series. The mysteries are a bit deeper and a bit darker. However, that doesn't make this series any less enjoyable.	2001-12-15

This book will help you find plants that are pretty and that won't take up a lot of water. IT's a great book.<br />This is our reference book for when we are adding something to our yard. We have a full acre that we are working on (slowly!) and this book has helped us every step of the way.<br />The color pictures make it easy to see exactly what a plant looks like. The color pictures also help when you are trying to find the name of the tree in some yard that you thought was pretty. The information it has on each plant is very useful- it gives you the area it will grow best in (example: Albuquerque or statewide in the shade or statewide up to 800 feet elevation). The other thing that makes this book a good buy is the plant list for different areas. For example, there is a plant list for Gallup/Grants area. These lists give you trees, grasses, shrubs, flowers and more that will grow well in your area.<br />This is the best resource out there if you live in New Mexico and want to have a lovely landscaped area.	2001-12-09

It was a light mystery with a lot of fun thrown in via the dissapearing body, the vanishing wedding dress and the other problems that arise from having a murder and a wedding.<br />The author did a good job of picturing the tense times of a wedding. All that was lacking was the normal night before the wedding fight between groom and bride.<br />I read the other reviews and I disagree in that I didn't find the main character, Susan, to be extremely self centered. Rather I found her to be a normal, flawed mother who was working hard to make the best wedding she could for her daughter. I thought her reaction to finding the dead body and her solutions to hiding the dead body funny.<br />The book was fun and enjoyable. It was a light mystery that didn't have a lot of gore. I will read others by this author.	2001-12-05

Before reading this one, I'd suggest you buy the first one in this series. The series is about three strong women who must each conquer a weakness and take control of their life.<br />This book is about Ripley, sherrif on a small island, who has supernatural powers and MacAllister Brooke, a man who research the otherworldly.<br />Ripley has denied who she is to herself and those around her for many years. She has lost at least one friend by doing so. When Brooke comes to the island to learn more about the mysterious events he has heard about, they meet. These two strong minded individuals fall in love. Through falling in love, Ripley learns to accept herself and learns to control her power.<br />A very powerful book.<br />Tied into this story about these two lovers is the past history of the island and the legacy  the girls' previous relatives left.<br />Nora does a masterful job, as always, of tying all the subplots and stories into one strong story. The characters from the previous novel grow and continue in this novel. I look forward to reading the last one of this series to see how each character grows and develops. The settings is wonderful. You can truly picture the island, the yellow cottage and the bookstore.<br />This book, once again, confirms why Nora Roberts is a favorite of mine.	2001-12-02

However, after that it was no holds barred scary stuff.<br />Derek Crowe, in his push to write &quot;the&quot; book that will get him a following, he alters some ancient, mystical writings. Thus he unleashes the mandalas. Rather than being the benevolent beings he represents them as, the mandalas are truly scary beings that feed on human passions.<br />Even at the end when you think things are going to be better and at least leave you with hope, your fooled. Maybe there is hope, maybe there isn't.<br />The other two main characters Michael and Lenore are very believable and interesting. They keep the plot moving to it's climax. Every character in this book only adds to the story. Rather than distracting the reader with too many subplots and substories, this book just leads the reader from opening page right to the end.<br />A true winner.	2001-12-01

If you and your spouse can sit down before having kids (even before getting married) and talk about religion it is a good thing. This book led to us really problem solving our day to day living between my husband and myself and our religions. This book was a great starting point for discussions.<br /> I particularly liked the questions that provided a starting point for discussions. I also liked the stories of other couples and how they handled their differences. I liked the ideas that this book has for different ways to handle different religions.<br />The chapters are short and easy to read in one sitting.<br />One thing we learned was to focus on the similarities and go from there. We were also reminded that this is a multi cultural/mulit religion world and that to get along we need to learn to respect and understand other religions. Very good.<br />What a great way to start this type of discussion.	2001-12-01

I usually enjoy Carolyn Hart mysteries. They are easy to read and enjoyable. There is not a lot of angst or great horror. This one lived up to my expectations in some regards, yet was a disspointment in others.<br />First the positive: I like the mystery itself. I thought the ending was different than many authors would have used. I liked that. The characters are continuations of ones in her previous books and yet this book can stand on it's own. As always her mother in law is funny and offers a sence of the ridiculous for a reason. I appreciate that. I also appreciated that Annie did forgive her dad to a degree and try to get to know him now. At some point we all have to make that decision to move on or to dwell on the past. I think this was handled well. It wasn't the main story and therefore not a lot of time was devoted to this theme, which I think might dissapoint some readers.<br />The negative: The only unrealistic thing about this book was all of a sudden seeing your dad and finding out you had a step sister on this small island where everyone knows everyone. If the island had been bigger it might have worked. However, it just seems inconceivable to me that not once would Annie have seen this girl or known the connection she had to this girl. However, as I stated, this is not the main part of the story and is easily overlooked.<br />I enjoyed this book. It was not my most favorite Carolyn Hart book, but it was good. I'm not sorry I read it.	2001-12-01

She does that well in this book.<br />Annie is teaching a class about three great mystery writers only to have her plans upset by three ladies of mystery. One is Annie's mother in law, as always, is delightful. Slightly off kilter and yet she is on the mark with most things. The other two are fans of mysteries and known for causing problesm where they go. Very good.<br />Although it is usually easy to figure out who did it by the end of Carolyn Hart's books, it doesn't make it any less of an enjoyable read. THis is one of my favorite Death on Demand mysteries.<br />As an added bonus, you get a lot of references to other mysteries that are good reads as well.	2001-12-01

When I bought this book, I expected to see more of a checklist of what my child needed to know for Kindergarten and what my child would learn in Kindergarten. As a former Kindergarten teacher, I have an idea of what is needed, but I wanted it in writing. What I got was different, but not bad.<br />This book is devided into sections: reading, writing, art, etc.<br />There are whole stories, poems, songs, and lessons for a kindergartener. While I don't expect that it will be enough for teaching a whole year of Kindergarten at home, I think it will be a great start. The emphasis is placed on reading (rightly so I think). I would like to see more in the math section though. I find that the art section is lacking, while the Social Studies section has much more than I would expect a Kindergartener to know. I hope I'm pleasantly suprised in that area.<br />For information purpose it is not in a themematic form. It does cover many of the things that you would expect to see in a classical education (artists, authors, paintings etc). But it is lacking if you want a fully classical education.<br />While there a few resources, there are not near as many as I would like to see. I'd also like to see a comprehensive, overall list of what a child is expected to know before and after Kindergarten.<br />While it seems that I have discussed many of the points I see that need improvement, I think this book is great. It is probably the most comprehensive one book you can find for helping your child in Kindergarten. This would be a great start for homeschooling parents who don't want to spend a lot of money. It is a great book for parents who want to help their child learn prior to and during kindergarten but aren't really sure what to do.<br />I would buy this book. Just be aware of the limitations and be prepared to suppliment those areas.	2001-11-28

It lists one thing that kids should be able to do (identify colors and mix them to make new colors) and then provides some resources or books that will help teach this concept.<br />To get the information I wanted I am forced to wade through the references and suggestions. That is why I rated it four stars. I think I'd like to have a checklist at the end of each section that has just the expectations of each grade. However, I'm not sorry I bought this book. I have a feeling that as time goes on I'll refer to it more and more.<br />Great resources.

However, everything we have done has been fun.<br />We made the sugar eggs for some of the kids in the playgroup and they were a big hit.<br />This book is sure to help you enjoy the time you have with your children. IT has helped our family to explore new things and try new ideas.<br />Enjoy.	2001-11-28

Usner's love of Chimayo and it's history comes through loud and clear in this book. Through interviews, historical documents preserved by families of Chimayo, stories of residents, and pictures Don Usner is able to tell the history of this interesting plaza.<br />I feel that the stories and information in this book serve as an example of each plaza in New Mexico. I believe that many of the plazas and towns are similar to Chimayo. The difference is that Chimayo has preserved it's history through being off the beaten path and not much of a tourist attraction (except for those who are interested in history!)<br />I was able to hear Mr. Usner talk to a group of teachers about the writing of this book and his other book. He has gone through a lot of trails to publish this book and preserve the history of Chimayo. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Usner.<br />I would buy more books by this author. He able to take a subject that many authors would make dry and uninteresting and make it come alive. Very good.	2001-11-28

Even if you don't 'buy into' everything John Rosemond says, this book is full of great information.<br />He begins by talking about the nature of two year olds, where they are developmentally, how they think, etc. Then he takes that and begins to help you solve problems based on how a two year old thinks and acts.<br />I refer to this book when a new problem comes up or when I'm not able to correct a behavior. Invariably I find straight forward advice. The advice is up front and to the point with the information needed to back up why this should work. (And for me, it usually does work).<br />This is the type of book you want to read when you have an 18 month old baby and again when your child turns two and again at about 2 1/2 to refresh your memory. It's that useful.	2001-11-28

However, it can certainly stand alone if you have not read the first one.<br />This book is supposed to be occuring simultaniously as the first one. It ties in well with the first one with the characters referring to the ones in the first novel.<br />Alexandra Golden is an architect. She has just learned she has a brother that she had been seperated from before she was adopted. She learns this by recieving a short letter and a pile of papers in the mail. Just when it seems things are going her way, a man breaks in trying to get the papers she was sent. Fortunately, Roarke Stone is there to save the day. He saves her several times in the course of this book. Very interesting.<br />Roarke is the sexy, patient kind of guy I'd like to have saving me if I were in trouble. Alexandra is the gutsy, smart type of woman I'd like to be. She holds her own in this book and I like that.<br />A great read.	2001-11-20

This is well worth the time to read. Just be prepared to sit down and not get up for several hours while you read this book cover to cover.<br />Adreianne and Phillip have a truly believable love. Adrianne is a strong character surviving everything she has. Her goals are admirable. Although I tend to not like stories of thieves, this book is an exception.<br />Nora writes so well about Phoebe and the abuse she suffered, it is very true to life. That makes this book disturbing in some ways. However, she doesn't dwell so much on the abuse that it overshadows the whole book.<br />A great book. The characters are believable. The setting is exotic. The plot runs smoothly and the actions of each character are realistic based on previous events in the book. Very good.	2001-11-20

The suspense began the minute the book opened and continued to the end.<br />Although I don't see this book as being realistic, I thought that only added to the enjoyment of reading this story. (sometimes too realistic is not fun!) The characters are fully developed and the reader is able to see their thoughts as they develop, which only adds to the plot.<br />I appreciated the 'innocent' type of outlook Michael has about his job. It only added to the excitement as he struggles to learn what exactly is happening.<br />enjoy.	2001-11-07

My son (age 2) enjoys the repition and singy songy rythm to the words. My daughter (8 months) likes the pictures. I enjoy the fact that these are not books I get tired of reading three and four times a night.<br />Boynton books are wonderful and this one is a lot of fun.

WHAT A GREAT BOOK!<br />I truly enjoyed this book. I went out and bought his other books and loved them just as much. Very Good!<br />There are enough twists and turns in the plot that I kept reading and finished this book in about two days. I also found that there was just a touch of humor and irony in this book to keep it from being too 'dark'.	2001-11-05

This is a short and sweet introduction to St. Louis Cemetery # 1 in New Orleans. Although this is the type of book you can read at home it becomes much more relevent if you take it along with you and read it as you tour this cemetery. Very interesting information.<br />I rated it four stars rather than five because Robert Florence wrote another book called New Orleans Cemeteries. Much of the introduction of this book is almost word for word in the New Orleans Cemeteries. That made it redundant for those of us who have read the larger, more complete book about all the cemeteries in NO.<br />I enjoyed this book. It was filled with a lot of good information. The authors appreciation of cemeteries and their buildings and history shows in this writing. I particularly like that there are stories of some of the people buried in this  cemetery. I would have liked to see more of that (Another reason for the four rating.)<br />Overall, I'd buy this book again and take it with me on my tour of this cemetery.	2001-11-01

It is written as if a Grandmother is telling the story to her grandchildren.<br />Here are my big problems with this book-<br />First it really isn't directed to a younger age group because of the language (high vocabulary words). It is almost too childish for an older age group. About the only group that it might be appropriate for is the middle school age child. However, they wouldn't tolerate the sugary words.<br />It is too sickly sweet for my tastes. Open any page and it reads something like this 'My dear children, he said 'my good friends, our hopes have been dashed and our hopes were illusory.' Or 'They vied with each other in their kind offices with so much grace that it only added more charm'.<br />It is an interesting read if you want to learn about the Acadian exile. However, there are other books out there that I feel do a credible job without all the sugary words.	2001-11-01

Here is the thing, it doesn't take long to figure out who did it. However, the search for the motive is what makes this book interesting. The end was a shock to me as well.<br />Skip witnesses a murder while doing patrol/crowd duty during Mardi Gras. She is soon working hard to solve a murder.<br />I enjoyed this book. I think the author did a great job of giving a true feel for New Orleans from an insider point of view. For me, it was like revisiting the city I love.<br />I appreciated the substories as well. Skip's family and their social standing vs. her non social climbing tendencies and will to make it on her own is very interesting. The relationship between Skip and her new boyfriend only adds to the story rather than detracts.<br />I am looking forward to reading more books by Julie Smith.	2001-10-27

This book is a set of postcards that you can use to introduce your young child to art (paintings). If you are interested in using these postcards the way they are intended, I strongly suggest you consider buying the parent/teacher guide.<br />The pictures are reproduced gorgeously. They are on thick, stiff paper so they are not easily torn or ruined. There are pairs to match, sets to sort, and more.<br />This is a great addition to a classical education.	2001-10-27

This book is filled with an off beat sence of humor. It isn't the slap you in the face kind of humor but rather the kind of humor that hits you later. For example, I found myself smilingat something I read earlier in the day while cooking dinner. At the end of this book you feel like you know each of the people personally. I wanted a follow up to find out what happened to each person. It's that good.<br />Basically this book is about Betty MacDonalds stay in a sanitorium while she had TB. She can take such a serious topic that could be pretty morose and turn it into something interesting and funny.	2001-10-27

The pictures add to the text rather than being a distraction to the text.<br />The repetitive nature of the book is great it makes for a good prereading book.

There are many hints and techniques as well as a encouragement. If you are just starting down the road to organizing, this is a good book to begin with.<br />However, if you already have a fairly well run family and need to fine tune your organizing this is not the book to get.<br />Much of this can be read in any women's magazine in any given month. Many of the ideas are very simplistic (not that this is all bad).<br />Overall, I'd say that there are other better books out there that deal with organizing a home. I prefer Confessions of a Happily Organized Family or others by the same author.	2001-10-22

First the Positive:<br />I like John Rosemond and I appreciate his advice. Even if I don't always agree with everything or use everything he says, I like most of his suggestions. This is good old fashioned parenting at it's best.<br />This book is easy to read. There are 366 short articles. Each article tackles one subject and provides some thoughts about how to deal with each subject. Some things covered are whining, spanking, chores not being done, discipline, etc.<br />My only complaint: These articles cover such a wide range of topics and a wide range of ages only a small portion of it is useful for me at any given time.<br />This book sits on my shelf and I use it as a reference tool. As we enter each stage of childhood, I refer to it to refresh my memory of what I read. There are many good suggestions in this book.<br />If you want to raise well behaved children that don't drive you and those around you to distraction, this is the book to get.	2001-10-22

Cheaper cuts of meat come out tasting great, no hot ovens and stove tops for little fingers to get burned on, easy to use, and good results.<br />This book is a great resource for Crockpot cooking. The recipes turn out great. Almost everything is easy to make and there are not any unusual or exotic ingredients called for in the meals.<br />There are a few good crockpot recipe books available that are still in print.

In the parents guide are the directions using these postcards to introduce art, artists, schools of art and paintings to your young child.<br />Basically this book is a set of postcards that you can use to introduce artists and their famous paintings to your young child. You can match pictures, match names to paintings and more.<br />My son really enjoys looking at these paintings. I'm glad we have this book. Although it's really not a book anymore since we cut up the postcards to play matching games with them.	2001-10-20

Harlequin Intrigue offers the best of those, usually.<br />This book however, was not even interesting as far as I was concerned. There were too few characters to make the book interesting and this made it very predictable. There was the lady (Lacy), the man (Turner), the two men who were guilty and that was about it. There were a few characters on the side who poked their head in the book for a few seconds but they didn't add much except to keep the book moving.<br />I would rate this a low three or a higher 2. The reason it got that much of a rating was that Lacy was a real pistol standing beside her man with very little hesitation. She wasn't afraid to do what she needed to do to learn the truth. Also, after they did decide they were in love, the romance was a little bit better. The characters fell in love rather quick with no understanding of what it was they liked about each other.<br />Not much mystery and not much romance.<br />There are other HI books out there that are more interesting. I'd give this one a skip and pick up a different one.	2001-10-19

First- the positive: This is a fresh look at art works that run the gamut from silver bowls to statues to paintings and more.<br />I particularly like the little side squares giving a little big of information about the artist. It might be a story, some facutal information, or information about other art made by this person.<br />In very limited space (one to two pages) Sister Windy is able to convey to the reader what it is she likes about each particular piece of art she included in her book. The brief history she gives about the painting only adds to the understanding of each artwork.<br />I also liked the fact that she didn't spend a lot of time analyzing the paint strokes, chisel marks etc. She didn't spend a lot of time discussing what the artist was trying to say or the political ramifications of each piece. She wrote clear, concise explanations about what she liked about each piece, what each piece was about, a short history of the time and the artist and the art work and left it at that. There are other books that you can buy about each artist, their work, their genre of work etc. if you want a more in depth look and more information that you will never remember.<br />Her enthusiasm for each piece she chose to place in this book is wonderful.<br />The pictures are glorious.<br />The negative: Proofreading. Two or three times I'd take a second look at the picture of the art because what was said in the text didn't match the words.  (For example, in one she talks of the lady pulling the man's beard and as far as I can see it's his hair!)<br />Overall, this is a wonderful book. I found it very educational and enhlightening.	2001-10-18

What a surprise at the end.<br />I appreciated how the two main characters are thrown together in a situation far beyond their expectations. The sparks between Grace and Ed are electric. Grace is her own woman not afraid to do what she thinks needs to be done to find her sister's murderer. Ed is a cop through and through. What a combination.<br />Wonderful.	2001-10-18

This was a fun read.<br />Basically this ex-lawyer, guitar playing man is called and asked to go to Sedona to play with a friend of his. Everything that can go wrong does- flat tire, lost luggage, a murder or two, a surly cop and being shot at. What makes this book interesting is how the main character, Tony, handles all these things. His bad attitude about New Age stuff I think is kind of funny.<br />I would certainly read more by this author.<br />I rated this a four (if I could I'd rate it a high three or a low four) because there are times that things are flat. For example, the parts with the lady cop with her attitude doesn't come across as being very well written. Also, there is a lot of casual sex in this book some of which could be left out. (not details thank goodness!)	2001-10-17

The Hidden Years is very good.<br />It starts with lovely lawyer Cassidy bringing some papers and legal 'stuff' to an old friend named Jake. Jake has been searching for his sisters for 10 years. Cassidy found papers pertaining to this search in her deceased father's stuff.<br />A rocky start between two people, a horrible attack on Cassidy by a stranger and the the book is off and running.<br />IT has a catchy beginning the drags you in to the story. There are twists and turns in this book that I find common for Susan Kearny novels, they keep you interested and reading. The romance is believable. Very enjoyable.<br />I read Harlequin Intrigue because they are quick reads. I like mysteries and I like love stories. These combine both. I like HI books by Susan Kearney. Enjoyable.	2001-10-12

First- this book is about the El Camino Real in Louisiana. It is very informative. However, it is very dry reading. If you are interested in Louisiana history, this book would be a useful one to have because this area was very important in the history of Louisiana. The main reason I rated it three stars is that there is some assumption you know who/what the author is talking about and without prior information from other sources, you might not know this information. Sometimes that made if difficult for me to read because I was finding myself looking up names or places or events in other books to get a background on what the author was talking about in this book. Overall though, this book is very informative.	2001-09-28

It has a lot of interesting information that the history books don't tell you. This is not a book of dates and figures. This book is not filled with unimportant trivia. Rather, this book takes a look at the people and events of history and tells you the untold story behind the story. It makes for a lot of fun reading and interesting conversation.	2001-09-27

I woke my husband up the other night laughing while reading this book.<br />The characters in this book are too funny. Grandma, Cousin Vinnie, Sally Sweet and Lula each add a new dimension and many laughs to this story. Grandma is the type of granmother you would love to have; she says what she is thinking. Lula is one of the funniest characters and as this series continues, she gets better and better.<br />I particularly like how Stephanie's cars get blown up over and over again, but not the blue bomb. Wonderful.<br />Enjoy.	2001-09-27

It is about strong women doing what they have to do to make their place in the world. It is about three strong women who are basically starting over.<br />This book in particularly is about Laura Templeton. She is a divorced mother of two children. She is proud and strong. She won't cash in on her family name and instead works hard to make time for her children, take care of herself and make a living. Gradually, she gets to know Michael Fury, an old friend of her brother. As they get to know each other, true love blossoms. This is not just true love in an easy sence, but a love based on respect and common interests and strong wills. Wonderful.<br />This is a great series. Although each book can stand alone, why not start with the first book in this series and read all three in order. I find that the characters build on themselves and grow as you read the books in order.	2001-09-27

I have this book on my shelf. Among the many books regarding the JFK assassination, this book is a constant on my shelves.<br />If you are reading about someone in connection with the JFK murder and you want to see what they look like (put a face to the name) this book most likely has a picture of that person. If you want to see that infamous day in order of events from the plane landing at the airport to the new president being sworn in, this is the book to refer to.<br />If you are someone who is researching the JFK assassination or is curious about that day, this is the book to get. An excellent book to have for research.	2001-09-26

It is very simple and does not go into a lot of details about the demise of many of the Indian tribes in Louisiana. It is a good introduction however.<br />I read this book and some of it seemed very dated. It is full of information. However, there are times in the book when I would think - 'well, that is not how we would say it now'.<br />On a positive note, the author does talk about the tribes as if they are seperate, rather than lump them together as Indians, as many books do.<br />Great introduction book for young children just beginning to learn about Louisiana.	2001-09-25

The romance was wonderful (which is typical of Nora Roberts books). The story line is interesting. However, I think that this book, while good, is not her most memorable. Many times after reading a Nora Roberts book, I will wonder how it would have ended if I had been the main character, or what I would have done differently. I didn't do that with this book. I did enjoy it though.	2001-09-25

Finding a book by Nora I haven't read, is like finding a present under the tree that hasn't been opened yet. Exciting.<br />The romance in these books is wonderful. In the first story Dee comes to America to live with her Uncle Padrick and meets the owner of the stable, Traves. I truly loved the relationship Dee has with her uncle. I also like the romance as it grows into true love.<br />In the second story, Erin meets Burke and decides to travel to America with him. Truly enchanting.	2001-09-24

Great Idea	I believe that exposing your child to a lot of different things is a good idea. I particularly believe two of the most overlooked things that are easy to expose children to is art and music.<br />This book is book one of the postcard series for exposing your child to art. This book is just postcards of different artists and styles of art. There are multiples of some of these postcards that you can use for matching.<br />If you do nothing else except look at these postcards with your child, you have done a lot.<br />If you follow her easy to do 'program' of matching, buying and sorting postcard sized art, this book is a must. It sure beats trying to find your own postcards and mount them.<br />As an added note, it is well worth the extra money to get the parent/teacher book explaining why and how to complete these easy activities with your child.	2001-09-24

This is a great book to take with you as you travel. Even if do not take it with you, this is certainly the book you want to refer as you plan your trip.<br />There are a slew of museums that sound like they would be interesting to visit. There are many museums that I have visited that were interesting.<br />For many years, as my husband and I have traveled, we have tried to find the small museums in each of the towns we visited. We have learned that almost every town we visit has a small museum. Unfortunately, many of these museums are not worth the time and effort. This book seems to have the cream of the crop. We know if it's listed in this book, we make the effort to see it.<br />A great resource for traveling on the road. Visiting small museums (and large) is an easy way to add planned breaks to your driving, stretch your legs, learn about your country, and more. This book can only enhance any trip you take.	2001-09-24

Nora Roberts makes you feel that you can just walk into this family and feel a part of it.<br />I particularly liked the story about Mikhail. He is strong and sexy and full of spirit and heart.

So I'm on here buying it again. <br />One night when doing research on the internet, I found this wonderful site about traveling. (roadsideamerica.com) I had so much fun looking at this website and learning about what I could see while I traveled, I knew I wanted the book. I had a ball reading it and planned to go out of my way to see some of the fun things listed in this book. I passed it on to my dad when he went on a road trip and he won't give it back. So I'm buying a new copy, it's that much fun. <br />This book puts the fun back into travel. Forget about hotels and motels and route numbers, these you can find out for yourself on a map. Forget about phone numbers and costs and hours of operation- those change. This book helps you open your eyes to see what there is to see- fun museums, crazy statues, small churches and more. <br />Even if you don't travel, this is a fun book to read. <br />What a gem.	2001-09-24

For example, instead of talking about the virtues of Plantation Alley, the author calls it Chemical Corridor.

When I wanted to learn more about what Watergate was and what exactly happened this is the book I turned to. This book did an admirable job of explaining exactly what happened. However, this book is more about how the authors, who were reporters, found out about watergate and how they broke the whole watergate story. I am glad I read this book. It certainly opened my eyes and led me into other areas of interest regarding our political system and our leaders. However, I did walk away with some questions about Watergate itself- what the results of Watergate were? etc. A great book and a great introduction. Would that we had more reporters like this.	2001-09-23

The history it tells doesn't get bogged down in dates and numbers, but rather the people and a typical home in Southern Louisiana. The cookbook is well organized. The recipes are easy to follow and the results are great. I have only good things to say about this cookbook.<br />My only be aware comment is that most Cajun cooking requires such yummy foods as shrimp, crab, tasso etc. While some of these are available at the local grocery store, some ingredients (tasso, andouille) are only available in the South or via special order.<br />Wonderful cookbook. Certainly this is one that will stay on my shelves and will be well used and loved.	2001-09-23

I am going to hang on to my copy for a while and see if I ever use it. Here is what I think.<br />First the positive:<br />The recipes are very yummy. They turn out wonderful. They have reasonable serving sizes that are low in fat. The pictures are gorgeous.<br />These are the types of recipes that you want to cook to impress someone when time and effort are no bother. You can fluff your hair and say, &quot;yes, I made it from scratch and it's low in fat too&quot;!<br />The negatives:<br />Each recipe is a lot of work. These are the types of recipes a budding gourmet cook might want to make. They are time consuming and use a lot of ingredients that is not always on hand (shrimp, lime juice, fresh herbs etc). Low fat cooking should not be so hard.<br />IF you want to really impress someone with a yummy dish and don't care about how much time and effort it takes, this is the book to get. However, I think for the one or two meals that you might be doing this- it's easier to just forget about the low fat part and go with some high fat easy to cook wonderful meal.	2001-09-23

(I believe sometimes the pictures in childrens' books get too distracting with too many things going on.) I look for books that have bright colors that keep my child interested in the pages. I look for books that we can do more than just read the book.<br />This book fits all those catagories. This pictures are simple and yet exciting enough that the keep my child's attention. We like to try to act out the dance the animals are doing after we have read the book. Sometimes we sing this book to a country music type of tune. The rythm of this book makes it a lot of fun to read. We are able to count the animals, make the sounds the animals make and in general have a great time with this book.<br />All of the books by Boynton are fun.

I have read a lot of books on the JFK assissination.<br /> This book caught my eye for that reason. However, once I began reading it, this book kept my attention. It read like a novel. I liked that, it was a switch from the usual fact presented like facts JFK conspiracy books. I liked that about this book. It certainly had me convinced that this guy had something to do with the JFK murder. It made me wonder why we didn't do more then in regards to this guy.<br />The book was gory when talking about the dismemberment of his mother and father. I really didn't like that. I'm not sure that it added much to the book except some length. However, it did make me realize that this was the type of man who would do what he thought needed to be done and might certainly shoot at a president.<br />This book is very interesting and those interested in reading about the JFK assassination would do well to consider reading this book. It is an easy one to skip over with the massive amounts of books available to read. However, the novel like feel of this does not detract from the research completed and conclusions drawn in this book.	2001-09-21

Even now whenever he sees something dinosaur, he'll say &quot;Roar&quot;!<br />There are so many books for children out there, it's hard for me to say one is a must have over the other.

Each story is about 2-5 pages long. There are some black and white pictures of these same people included in the book.<br />What a wonderful book. I particularly liked these were people who lived in New Mexico and that I could look at the pictures of each person as I read about them. This author has certainly done a lot of research. I have read a lot of New Mexico history and this book is gem. Many of the stories were ones that I had never heard before. Because the stories are short, it is easy to pick the book up for 15 or 20 minutes, read a story and put it down without losing your place. I appreciated the humor that Marc Simmons displays through out this book, many of these short stories end on a humorous note.<br />This is a great book about the people who lived in New Mexico when it was still being formed into a state. It certainly provides a history of New Mexico through a different slant. I enjoyed every minute of reading it. My husband read it and enjoyed it as well.	2001-09-20

I can read them over and over again and not get too burned out on them. That is a bonus in my book as far as children's books are concerned. I particularly like her illustrations.

It was.<br />I particularly liked that it was based in New Orleans and yet didn't get into all the voodoo type of mystery that so many New Orleans mysteries seem to involve. What a refreshing change. I also liked the fact that the story had several stories within a story- in other words, it wasn't just about Skip solving a crime end of story. There was the boyfriend substory and the best friend who has kids and needs help story and more. That kept the book interesting and the realistic.<br />There were several things I didn't like- First, this book seems very dated to me regarding the internet. The characters on an bulliton board site that had thousands of users and yet they all seemed to be good buddies, at least that is what the author would have you think. Also, has been widely used for a long time, yet for Skip this is a new thing. It makes the book seem very dated. This one thing really bothered me. I kept wanting to jump up and explain to her how this whole internet thing worked. The people around her were not doing a very good job of explaining things or demonstrating things to her.<br />The other thing I didn't like was that I wanted a happy ending for her and her boyfriend and that just didn't seem to happen. However, even despite that the book ends with a hint of optimism and hope.<br />I enjoyed this book. I'm going to go back and swipe up the other 3 earlier novels and read them.	2001-09-20

Most of the activities suggested are easy and cheap using on hand materials and things found in nature.<br />Although I didn't view this as a parenting book per say, I found it to be more of a philosophy of living with children. It certainly has influenced the way I parent and some of the activities I do with my children.<br />As and added benefit, I did a lot of research taking off from this book on Waldorf schooling and found a lot I liked about it.

Deserves it's award	This book is filled with lovely pictures of a mother duck as she searches for her baby who wandered off.<br />The pictures are wonderful. The few repetitive words there are encourage my child to 'read' the book. He also loves finding the duck on every page.<br />I wish I could find more books like this one- simple, gorgeous pictures, a nice story with a happy ending, a lot of opportunity for other activities while you read. We find the missing duck, count the ducklings, look at the pretty colors, look for other animals and more.	2001-09-20

Only now, they are married with kids and it's their daughter who has the great adventure. What a wonderful treat to read about favorite characters from older stories and catch up on their lives. How fun to read about their children growing up and falling in love.<br />I particularly liked the seduction scene when Keely decided she wanted Brian. There were many scenes in this book that I laughed out loud or giggled.<br />I enjoyed this book it is a true romance.	2001-09-19

I picked this book up one time when I was visiting there. I was looking forward to reading about the roads the Chacoans built.<br />There are these massive roads that have been cleared away leading to/from Chaco canyon. They connect pueblo to pueblo. They go for miles and miles in straight lines. Although many of these are covered by weeds, these roads can be seen from the air and if you know where to look, they can be seen on the ground. No one is really sure what these roads were for- ceremonial? travel?<br />This book is very interesting. However, I found it to be very dry reading. It really seemed to be directed towards a college class level rather than someone like myself who just wanted to learn more in laymen terms.<br />If you can get over the dry reading, this is a great book. It is the only book that I have been able to find regarding the Chaco Canyon roads themselves (although many books mention them.) IF you find a better book regarding these mysterious roads, please drop me a note.	2001-09-19

Although some of these stories can never be verified, they are very interesting to read.<br />I like that there are directions included at the end of each story for those that would like to see where these events happened. I also like that there is a bibliography at the end of each chapter so that the reader can further explore those stories that interest him/her. The pictures are few and far between and are black and white. However, the pictures that are included are relevent to the text.<br />A vern interesting book.	2001-09-19

Almost all of these formulas are easy to make and every one I have tried out works well. The ingredients called for are usually very cheap and easy to find.<br />My only two issues with it are: 1- Some of the ingredients called for in some of these formulas are not normally kept in the home and will require a trip to the grocery store. 2- This book covers such a wide variety of formulas for a lot of uses. This is frustrating for me because my brain doesn't work that way. I tend to ilke things that belong together to be together. I just forget sometimes to consider looking in this book when trying to find a solution to a problem (ants, acne etc). This book has recipes, formulas for ant prevention and cleaning solutions all in one book. However, they are devided into appropriate sections.<br />I have gotten rid of this book once, only to find myself looking for it later to get a solution to a problem with ants. I ran right out, bought it again and now it's staying on my shelves.	2001-09-19

Although, even my husband found a few good ideas in here.<br />Dian Thomas provides a wealth of information regarding camping. She has many lists that are very useful, including what to carry with you when camping, a simple first aid kit, a preparedness pack and more. She has diagrams and drawings for creative ideas; for example, how to make a toilet paper holder that will keep the toilet paper clean, out of the dirt, easy to transport, and cheap to make. She also provides some good information regarding picking out camping gear (but this is not the majority of the book).<br />My only comment would be that if you tried to do all of this, you would have a car full of stuff. You will have to pick and choose what is important to you.<br />Very useful book. I'm glad I bought it. I have picked up quite a few hints on camping and roughing it with kids.	2001-09-19

He said that if I tried one, I'd be sure to read more. He was right.<br />Kevin Kerney is feeling the pressure to solve this killing spree and arrest a murderer. Written in a very realistic manner, Mr. McGarrity writes about the politics governing a search for a killer. The New Mexico he describes is very much like the state I live in.<br />My only thought is that sometimes his books get depressing. I found this one depressing at times as well- abusive fathers, affairs and frustrating long distance relationships all add to the occasional darkness of this story. However, it is all written with a very true to life feel and handled with tact.<br />I have read other books written by Michael McGarrity and plan on reading more of his books.	2001-09-18

I found this book to be very useful in planning our family camping trips.<br />I particularly liked the fact that at the start of each hike was some information that can help me rule out or count in a hike with very little reading. For example, it will provide: distance, elevation, elevation gain, interesting points of the hike, maps that I might want to have, the difficulty, the best season to hike this trail. THe maps also are very useful.<br />My only comment would be that the pictures are black and white and many of them can be left out with very little loss since they don't add much to the text. (in otherwords, they are flowers, chipmunks etc.)<br />An excellent resource for someone who might be interested in hiking New Mexico.	2001-09-18

Again and Again I am pleased with the books she writes. I particularly like her series books.<br />This is the second book in this series about a family in Ireland. I have to admit to being a little bit hesitant to reading books about Ireland because many times the author will get sidetracked by faeries, goblins, and pots of gold. Although Nora Roberts did a great job in the first book of this series, I was worried she wouldn't do so well this time. Not to fear, she wrote with her usualy flair for romance and although there were some faery stuff, it wasn't so much it took away from the story.<br />Nora's love of Ireland shines through in her writing. The descriptions of Ireland make me feel that I could travel there and see exactly these places she describes.<br />The characters are adorable. They are non traditional in that Brenna is the hammer holding, jack of all trade type woman. She is one who can change the oil, take care of herself, and cook dinner. Shawn is a musician. This book explores the changes that take place in relationships as friendship turns to love. It does a credible job of exploring the fears and concerns of the two main characters and those around the two characters.<br />I particularly like how characters from past books in this series are reintroduced and you are able to follow their lives as well.<br />What a wonderful, well written book.	2001-09-18

It has a lot of information that is well worth reviewing before taking a trip in New Mexico.<br />There is contact addresses and phone numbers if the information in this book is not enough, you can call and write for more. There are lists of annual community events, things to see, campgrounds, places to go, stuff to do from fishing to golfing to shopping. In other words, if you have children and want an activity for a certain area, this is the book to turn to.<br />I particularly liked the picture icons that are in front of each attraction. It made it easy to find a place to camp. The icons also made it easy to quickly rule out or read more about a place listed. I also felt that this book was logically seperated into different areas of NM (for example, Northern NM).<br />I think this is a must have book for those traveling with kids. We keep it in the car when we travel and refer to it before we reach a town. This way we can quickly review if we want to stop at an attraction in this town or travel on ahead and save our time for a later attraction.	2001-09-18

In other words, I do not have the revised and updated version.<br />However, if this one is anything like the copy I have, it is wonderful. The full color pictures are lovely and are used to enhance the text.<br />Although this book doesn't tell the history of these states, it visits historic places within each state. Much of the history of these four states (NM, AZ, NV, UT) is told through the landscape and historic buildings of each state.<br />I have enjoyed every place that I have visited and my visits have only been enhanced by using this book as a resource in my travels.	2001-09-18

It is a great book to read the history of the ghost towns and mining camps that can be found in NM. The authors have obviously done a lot of research and this results in a book that is informative, but fun to read. I particularly like how the authors have told various stories that are associated with each town. I find this to be a very accurate book also.	2001-09-18

The information includes the level of difficulty, location, attractions, maps to get, and other important information. The maps were very useful in determining starting points and ending points for planning purposes.<br />I found that the level of difficulty was accurate. This is very important to me because I'm a non hiker to very easy type of hiker.<br />My only comment would be that many of the pictures didn't add to the text and could have been left out.	2001-09-18

If you only read one New Mexico history book, this is the one to read.<br />I tend to believe that everyone should know the history of their country and the history of their state. This book is an excellent introduction to New Mexico history.<br />It can easily be read in a day or two and doesn't get bogged down in too many dates. For a book that has only 89 pages including the index, it has a lot of information. It touches on just about every major event of New Mexico history. It also touches on many of the important aspects that set NM apart from many other states; including but not limited to, mining, culture, ranching and more. The pictures only add to the text. I particularly liked the pictures, maps and copies of old documents. This has all the information you need regarding New Mexico history in a concise, well written book.<br />I rated it only four instead of five for two reasons:<br />one is due to the few number of pages, some of the more interesting stories about New Mexico are skipped. However, these types of stories can be easily found in other New Mexico books. The other reason is that sometimes the purpose of an event is not explored or the motive of the people involved are not explored. Again, this can be found in the more comprehensive books on NM.<br />If you are interested in a short, easy to read, to the point book about New Mexico history, this is the book to get. It has a wealth of information in just a few pages (less than 90). I strong suggest that everyone who lives in New Mexico should read about the history of this state and this is one good book to begin with.	2001-09-18

I was wrong.<br />This has stimulated my interest in geology. Each time we travel now, we take this book and the Roadside History of NM book with us. It makes our trips through New Mexico much more interesting. We stop and look at the places these books mention and read about the events that occured there and what the rocks are telling us. Sometimes we even take side trips to see things that are mentioned in one of these two books.<br />I particularly like how this book has diagrams and pictures to help clarify what it is exactly I'm looking at. There are answers to questions I wouldn't have thought to ask in this book.<br />If you drive through NM quite a bit, this is a good book to have with you as you travel. Even if you don't think you are interested in geology, this book is a good book to have.	2001-09-18

One of my favorite authors. Great	This book is wonderful.<br />The series is about a family in Ireland. The way Nora Robers writes about their lives and loves is absolutely wonderful.<br />I have to admit to being a little bit worried when I began this series because it is about Ireland. Most authors when writing about Ireland tend to let fairies and pots of gold over take the story. However, I wasn't dissapointed. Nora Roberts manages to weave some of the Irish myths into her writing without letting that take over her writing. Truly enchanting is an accurate description.<br />This book is about Jude trying to find herself. Not only does she find herself, but she finds a good man who is willing to work with her in life. Aiden is a wonderful man and fully believable (as is Jude). The fact that each character is a seperate person, with their own personality, is so much better than the typical &quot;I need a man to take care of me&quot; romance book.<br />This is a wonderful book and I couldn't put it down.	2001-09-17

She discusses sulfiting, steaming, no prep. etc. The author also explains the various methods of drying food (oven, dehydrator etc.) The pictures only enhance the text. Further more, the author provides several charts (one for fruit, one for vegies, one for meat, one for herbs) regarding how well certain foods dry, how long each food will save when dried. I particularly liked the recipes that used dried foods.<br />This is a great book to have if you are interested in drying foods. I constantly refer to this book every time I dry the extra food we have on hand.	2001-09-17

I tend to lean towards the conspiracy theory side of the JFK assassination. This book will have you believe that it was Oswald acting alone.<br />After having read almost every book I could get my hands on regarding the JFK murder, I decided to look at the other side of the issue. My father is convinced it was Oswald acting alone who killed JFK. I decided to see if there was some basis for his assertation. If you approach this book an open mind and are willing to consider that this author might be right, this book is very interesting.<br />I particularly liked that I felt the author had done a wealth of research and had added to the evidence rather than trying to debunk the assessination theories.<br />It's worth the time it takes to read this book. I would say that unless you are totally close minded regarding the JFK murder, this book might give you some things to think about. It did me.	2001-09-17

Many of these use simple supplies that you have around the house. Some of these ideas take a little bit of planning. However, most of these ideas are easy and cheap to set up and fun to do. A lot of these ideas are things that once you have demonstrated how to do the activity, your toddler will not need your help. Some of these ideas are meant to be mother/father interacting with the child.<br />My only thought would be that if you are a fairly creative person, many of these things you can come up with on your own. For example, freezing colored water and putting the ice cubes in a plastic bag to melt.<br />One thing I particularly liked was that the activities were geared to a variety of the sences. Some activities were smell oriented for example. Some activities were directed towards the other sences of taste, touch etc.  Other activities worked on small motor skills and others dealt with large motor skills.<br />If you want a wealth of ideas that are easy to impliment, fun to do, and fairly cheap to make this book would be a great resource.	2001-09-17

This book is my favorite of the Quinn brother series.<br />I laughed at Phillip's reaction to conversing with his dead father. I enjoyed watching the romance blossom between Phillip and Sybill. I think Nora handled what could be a silly situation with tact and class as usual.<br />Although this book can stand alone, it is much stronger if you have read the other Quinn brother books in order.<br />Enjoy- These are some of the best Nora Roberts books yet and this is the best of the best.	2001-09-17

I particularly liked the suggested places to see and lists of fairs at the end of each area chapter.<br />There were two things I didn't like about this book-<br />There were very few pictures. However, the pictures this book did have added to the text of the book. Secondly, I didn't like the fact that at times the book seemed to get bogged down in dates and names and places. However, history is just that at times- dates and names and places.<br />If you are interested in Louisiana history, but don't want to slog through a huge book of history, this is a very good book.<br />I think the authors state it best when they say that if this book was for a college course, the course would be Louisiana 101.	2001-09-17

I also found it to be very direct and to the point about what the authors think happened. I appreciated how they lined the information out step by step by step to back up their beliefs.<br />I was particularly interested in the unusual deaths of those people who are associated with the JFK murder. The large number of deaths in the unusual manners indicate a conspiracy if nothing else does. I like that this was covered in this book because many books tend to miss this point.<br />There are many conspiracy theories out there. I found that this one had proof and evidence that seemed to back up what might have happened. This is a good book and can be a good introduction to the JFK mystery.	2001-09-16

However, I have also taken some of her cleaning hints and used them in my spring cleaning and boy has it saved time. For example, she suggest you take a used drier sheet and wipe off the glass on your picture frames. I did this and it kept the dust away from my pictures. This also decreased my weekly dusting time.<br />What a wonderful book. Certianly it's not nighttime reading. However if you take the time to page through this book and look at some of her ideas, I believe you will be able to find suggestions that will help you save time and money as well.	2001-09-16

This one lives up to it's title.<br />Lifton's theory is that wounds were altered between Dallas and Bethesda. He provides credible proof that this could have happened. The pictures in this book only enhance the text and help to clarify the proof he offers.<br />There are many theories floating around in book form regarding the murder of JFK. This is one theory. However,I find this to be a believable theory. I believe this theory offers a good explanation of the events, particularly the discrepencies in the autopsy photographs. Rather than including everyone that had anything to do with JFK in a cover up, Lifton limits the number of people he includes. This makes it that much more believable in my opinion. (Too many people involved in a cover up and it's no longer a secret right?!) I particularly appreciated the fact that there were new to me pictures included in this book.<br />I would suggest that for people who are interested in studying the JFK assassination, this book is one that they should read.	2001-09-16

I was walking in the mall in Lafayette when the most wonderful smell stopped me. It was a chef giving out samples from his new cookbook. After one try, I knew that I wanted to be able to cook the wonderful foods I had just tried. Usually, this is an impossible task.  However, every recipe I have tried has been a success. I have found the recipes to be easy follow and easy to prepare and the result taste wonderful. The pictures only add to the book.<br />My only comment would be that for people who don't live in Louisiana, many of the recipes call for Louisiana type ingredients. These have to be special ordered or substituted in some way and are next to impossible to find locally (boudin, tasso, etc). So be aware when you buy this book that many recipes are typical cajun cooking recipes with Louisiana type ingredients.<br />Barring that, this is a nice cookbook.	2001-09-16

They are very true to life (at least for the part of Louisiana my husband comes from.)<br />The stories are the reason I bought this book. There is a lot of information regarding the culture and traditions of the Acadians and the lifestyle of Southern LA. The recipes are good.<br />Second: the needs work part-<br />These recipes were gathered together from a group of people. Because of this, many of the recipes are not typically cajun recipes. For example, there are many pasta recipes which have nothing to do with Cajun cooking. If you are looking for a cookbook with traditional Louisiana cooking try Talk about Good.<br />However, if you collect cookbooks and want to add an interesting cookbook to your collection, this is the one. Just realize that you will find many recipes in this book that are already in other cookbooks. If you are interested in reading about Louisiana and want some traditional recipes, this is a good book to get. Just realize that there will many non-Louisiana recipes included in this book.	2001-09-16

I have it on my shelf and it has stayed there long after many of the other books I have read on this topic and been taken off and given away. That is one of the best things I can say about a book.<br />This book covers most of the assassination theories out there. It states why this theory might be plausable and that is very powerful. Rather than knocking down the theories, it tries to present them in a very non biased way.<br />After reading this book, it will be evident that there is a conspiracy and that Oswald did not act alone.<br />This is one of the Must Have and Must Reads for those interested in the assassination of JFK.	2001-09-16

Thank you!<br />The recipes are fairly easy to prepare and the results turn out great meals.<br />My only issue with any cajun cooking is that it sometimes calls for those Louisiana type of ingredients that are hard to get anywhere else but Louisiana (tasso for example!)	2001-09-16

I saw this book and KNEW I had to have it.<br /><br />Every recipe I have tried has been tasty. There is something for everyone in this book- full of flavor, salty, sweet, easy to make, more challenging to make and on. The recipe titles are also funny.<br />The only comment I might make regarding this book is that some of the recipes I will most likely never try because they just seem too wierd. Also, I would have appreciated having some of the classics in this book- marshmallow balls, carmel popcorn. But mainly, that is because I'm lazy and it would be easier to reach for one book rather than dig through other recipe books looking for a caramel popcorn recipe.<br />Very good. A creative book.	2001-09-16

I do believe there was a conspiracy.<br />However, because I have read so many books regarding the JFK assassination, I decided I needed to give this one a chance. I wanted to see if there was compelling evidence that the 'lone-nut' theory might be correct.<br />I have to say that although this book didn't convince me that there was only one assassin (Oswald), it was very good reading full of information supporting the one assassin theory. It was interesting to see much of the same evidence that is pushed in conspiracy theory books pushed in this one.<br />If you are interested in reading why the conspiracy theories might be false, this is a good book to read.	2001-09-16

Although it says these recipes are light, I don't find them difficult or time consuming to cook (as much low fat cooking is.) Also, I don't notice a lack of taste.<br />I plan each of my meals in advance so that I have the correct ingredients on hand. This is one cookbook that I constantly refer to for meal planning. If you can get your hands on this cookbook, I would suggest that you grab the opportunity.	2001-09-16

I finished it with a heavy heart and found myself glad that it was over and that I could read soemthing more uplifting. All of the charcters are flawed which is very true to life. However, I found that they were much more flawed than I like. I prefer to think that most of humanity is much nicer and more likable than those characters.<br />One positive is that the author is very descriptive. You can almost taste the smoke and smell the smokers breath as the character talks. You truly can develop a picture many of the places the author writes about and envision the characters as they move through these places.<br />I tend to want to read books that will take me away from my every day problems, dirty dishes, whining kids and gazillions items on my to do list. If this is what you want it a book, you might consider looking elsewhere. There are plenty of good books out there that are not so depressing. Maybe I'm missing something in this book that others see, because of my reasons for reading. However, I think that this is the type of book that you probably either like or don't like and very few in between. Most of the reviews seem to support this as well.<br />...	2001-09-14

From the Greek Revival style plantations to Art Deco government buildings this book explains form and function of architecture typically seen in Louisiana. explain the vocabulary and provide many examples of each type of architecture.<br />My only two complaints- One is that I didn't see anything about Steamboat Style Architecture which I thought was unique to Louisiana. (Maybe I'm wrong- I'm not an expert.) Two- It was expected that the reader would understand many of the vocabulary words used in talking about architecture. Although many of these words were easy to decode by looking at the pictures and reading the paragraph, I would have been happier if there was a glossary explaining these new words. In other words, it was expected that the reader would understand more than a general lay person about architecture.<br />However, those two points aside, I take this book with me as we drive through Louisiana. I find it a challenge to classify the types of architecture we see on our trips.	2001-09-13

I particularly love when she takes a group of people with something in common (sisters, brothers, family, same location) and writes a series. The two stories in this book do not dissapoint.<br />Both stories are fairly quick reads because they are shorter than a typical Nora Roberts novel. However, that does not mean that the characters are not developed or the story line is not believable. Quite the contrary.<br />Natasha and Spence are both very realistic. I felt their actions were what I would do in a similar situation. I particularly like how I can place myself in the main character's (Natasha's) place and feel her emotions.<br />Rachel and Zack was a very interesting story. I particularly liked Zack's brother. Again, I am impressed by Nora Roberts ability to take tough subjects and treat them with respect while also writing a romance.<br />If you have not yet read any of the Stanislaski Series, this is a real treat and not to be missed.	2001-09-13

It took us 9 months of working at it to find a name we agreed on. Thank goodness for this book. There were names in here I had not even thought of, nor would I have ever heard of them.

Thank you to that nurse. When I got pregnant a second time, it was to this book I turned to for information. When I had complications, it was this book that helped me understand what was happening, why and some possible considerations.<br />I walked into each Dr. appt. prepared with an idea of what tests he would do, what questions he would ask and what he would look for. More importantly, I knew what kinds of questions I needed to be asking.<br />Having something that explained what was happening to my body and to my baby each month, took much of the mystery out of being pregnant. I particularly liked how the information is continually updated through revisions and editions.<br />I will admit that the diet stuff is a bit much. However, I didn't think there was a lot of diet information in this book, mainly because there is the compainion book &quot;what to eat when you're expecting.&quot;<br />I strongly suggest that if you are pregnant, you buy this book. This is one book I haven't loaned out or given away. I truly expect to be turning to it again sometime (soon I hope?!)	2001-09-13

So, I bought this book.<br />It is a wonderful book. I particularly like how it is divided into sections so that it is easy to find the area you are traveling in.<br />My only two negative comments regarding this book would be 1- the author gives information regarding stores and restaurants. I would rather not have this listed in a book because these kind of things tend to change. Also, finding places to shop and eat is the easy part, it's finding the places to go and knowing what to do when you get there that is difficult (I think).  and 2- The places listed are, for the most part, typical tourist attractions. If you are looking for a book FILLED with off the beaten path types of things, this is not the book.<br />However, if you are looking for a book that has a lot of great places to visit mixed in with a little bit history this is a good book to get. The organization is easy to understand and it is easy to find places to visit and things to see when using this book.	2001-09-13

It is very basic. If you have never done anything with photography, this is a good book. It helps explain some concepts in very easy to understand terms.<br />Next- The Negative: This book is VERY BASIC. If you read your owners manual that comes with the camera, much of what is in this book is covered in the owners manual.<br />I bought this book after I read my owners manual and took a simple photography course at the local college (non-credit for fun course!) This book was much more basic than I wanted. I found that I learned very little from this book because I had read the owners manual of my camera.

This book was what encouraged me to begin my quest of organizing my life. This book covers all aspects of organizing your life- organizing time, cooking and meal planning, cleaning house, etc. Although it covers just about every part of a home, it is not overwhelming.<br />If you are interested in organizing your home and want a starter book, I would suggest you consider this book. In this book she discusses the whys, how tos, and what fors of organizing every aspect of your life.<br />If you are already on the road to organizing and want a book that will give you cheap and easy hints and solutions to storage, I would put forth that Confessions of a Happily Organized Family is more about the how to of organizing. She provides a wealth of suggestions for storage and organizing solutions that are not very expensive and easy to make and/or buy.<br />Either way, both are good. Both are full of ideas. And for me, most importantly, both are encouragine and realistic.	2001-09-12

The pain he suffers from past abuse is very real and life like. The way in which he can help Seth turns this book into more than a romance. Grace is a wonderful woman who does everything she can to fight for the love she deserves with the man she wants.<br />I always appreciate Nora Roberts books. I like it when she writes something more than a romance or mystery. The real life topic in this book is child abuse and the devastating, life long effect it can have on families and people. Nora manages to tackle this very hard subject and still write an enjoyable book with a wonderful romance.<br />Although each book can stand alone, it is much nicer I find, to read the trilogies together in order. The characters grow and the plot builds until you reach a very satisfying ending.	2001-09-12

I enjoyed the first two books in this series and loved the third one.<br />I felt that Nora Roberts provided wonderful descriptions of Ireland. Reading this book left me wanting to go there and see for myself the magic.<br />I appreciate how every romance in the trilogy is different and does not follow a formula. The Darcy and Trevor romance was a fun romp for me.<br />Reading this book was like returning to visit old friends as many of the people in the firt two novels of this series are also in this one.<br />I wasn't dissapointed. I felt this book lived up to the first two in quality, romance, and fun.	2001-09-12

There was some useful and some interesting information, but I believe examples of this are given in a different review. There were a wide variety of cookie recipes and other types of recipes. The sugar cookies were great which is why it's still sitting on my shelves. One day I'll copy that recipe and get rid of the book.<br />Negatives- This book is not all cookie recipes. Many of the recipes I tried did not work and I had to improvise. For example, in one recipe I found I had to add two eggs and still add some water to the recipe. This is after following the directions exactly and trying to make the same recipe several tims and having each time to add the extra liquid.<br />Overall, I'd say that you can skip this one and that there are other better cookie cookbooks out there.	2001-09-12

I found that it was way way to overwhelming for me. I felt lost to begin with, which is why I was picking up a book about feeding my baby. All this book did was to overwhelm me even more and make me concerned I was doing everything wrong.<br />To top this off, I found some misinformation in this book. I think other reviewers spoke of this as well. Maybe it is just based on old information regarding feeding babies and will be updated sometime soon. One can only hope.<br />I would carefully research and look at other books before buying this one. However, if you want the be all end all book of directions for feeding your baby, this may be the one you want.	2001-09-12

I am always thrilled to find a new one or revisit one I have already read.  I am triply thrilled when I find a new trilogy. This set of books does not disspoint.<br />Again, all three of the books in this series can stand alone. However, I find that it is nice to read all three in order because the characters build on each other and develop throughout the series.<br />Sea Swept is about three men who had been taken in as young boys by a man who became a father to them. These three men are different but held together by love. When they are asked by their father to care for the new boy he had taken in, they do just that.<br />Seth is determined to live up to his father's expectation. He is a strong character with an iron will. He also is a very caring man who wants to do right by those around him. Anna is a social worker determined to do her job and ensure the young boy has a suitable home. What follows is a wonderful story about two people working together to provide a home for a young boy. It is wonderful when they realize that they are really walking down the same road and romance blossoms.<br />I enjoyed the humor that Nora Roberts displayed in this book. As this trilogy continues I found that the humor continued. I appreciated the true feeling of comaradarie among the men that Nora Roberts is able to write about.<br />I enjoyed this book immensily.	2001-09-12

(Revised): Home Cooking for a Healthy Baby & Toddler	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	A Must Have for Feeding your Baby	This book explains in detail how and when to introduce certain foods to your baby. It is based on some of the latest studies about feeding your baby.<br />I particularly liked that the directions were easy to follow. I appreciated the checklists that helped me track when and what I was feeding my baby.<br />If you think making your own baby food is hard, think again. This book is a must for parents who want to make their own baby food.	2001-09-12

She provides a wealth of suggestions for storage and organizing solutions that are not very expensive and easy to make and/or buy. I rate it five stars for the usefulness. My only thought about this is that much of this you can do yourself without buying the book.<br /> However, if you are not sure where to begin or need ideas on storage, this is an excellent book. However, if you are interested in organizing your home and want a starter book, I would suggest you consider her other book Confessions of a Happily Organized Homemaker. In this book she discusses the whys, how tos, and what fors of organizing every aspect of your life. Also, it seems to me that much of what is in this the Family book is also in the Housewife book. Either way, both are good.	2001-09-12

This one was no exception.<br />Grace is a very rich lady who does many good deeds. I had a hard time relating to her character. However, I feel that Nora Roberts does a very good job of developing it in pieces so that you can slowly get to know the full person behind the money. Seth is the cop working to solve a murder. The mystery and intrigue this book provides was wonderful.<br />I particularly liked the ending in this book. I thought it was fairly true to how I would act in a similar situation. (Would that I were so rich!)<br />Although this book can stand alone, the first two book in the star series will provide background on some of the characters involved. I would suggest that you read all three in order.	2001-09-11

The lay out makes it easy to use because it is devided into ages. There are things for every member of the family to participate in- activities, cooking, games etc.<br />The reason I rated if four stars rather than five was because for me, this book was TOO MUCH. I found it to be overwhelming to sort out the stuff I wanted from the stuff I didn't want. I found it difficult to really look at this book because there was just so much on each page.<br />Everyone tells me I have an analytical mind and maybe that is my problem. I would have appreciated having a more clean layout- rather than just a jumble of ideas for each age.<br />However, if you have no ideas for dealing with children, this is the book to have. This is a great book if you are a teacher who deals with a variety of prek ages. This book is also good for parents.	2001-09-11

Coping skills and techniques and information	Although directed towards family members of someone who has BPD, it was suggested that this book might be appropriate for relatives of other mentally ill (Mainly depressed people). Thus, when a therapist suggested I might try reading this to help develop coping skills for dealing with my depressed relative, I did. Much of this book can be discounted if you are not reading it for BPD specifically. However, the skills and techniques are very useful and seem to be helpful in dealing with my relative. I particularly felt that this gave me a new way to self talk that helped me let go of many of the negative feelings I am left with after an episode. I find this book to be very wonderful and useful.	2001-09-11

This book was not a dissapointment. In fact, of the three Star series books, this one was my favorite. I particularly liked the sparks that fly whenever Jack and MJ are together.

I LOVE Nora Roberts books.<br />Bailey has amnesia and she hires Cade to help her find out about herself. With a pile of money,a gun, a diamond worth a lot, a mysterious lady and a man- this mystery/romance is worth the read.<br />I thought it was kind of ironic to have amnesia and hire an PI to find yourself. What a different twist to the typical amnesia romance story. Of course, that is why I Love Nora Roberts books so much, because they are not typical.<br />These three were no exception. The one complaint that I would have with these three is that the definately work better if you read them in order. This is very rarely the case with Nora Roberts series. Usually each book in a series can stand alone or be read out of order with little loss in clarity. However, this series seemed to build on each other.	2001-09-11

With Brody's help in the manual labor Kate begins to make another dream she has come true. Brody's son is adorable and his character only adds to the story.<br />I particularly appreciated the way Brody continually is aware of the example he must set for his child. I appreciated the thought Brody put into this relationship with Kate and how it might affect his child. This just added to the story and made it that much more believable.<br />Although this book stands alone, I would suggest that if you enjoyed this book, you buy the other books in the Stanislaski Family series.	2001-09-11

However, what a wonderful surprise. Nora Roberts again thrilled me with romance and intrique.<br />I appreciate that Nora Roberts is willing to tackle difficult subjects such as spouse abuse. It is obvious to me that she did some research into this subject. The feelings that Nell experienced seemed very true to life.<br />I like even more that Nora Roberts is able to tackle difficult subjects, bring home her point, and still keep the book enjoyable and out of the dark and grim area of these subjects. What a talented author.<br />This was a fantastic book.	2001-09-11

I have to admit, I had several concerns when I picked up this book. First, I am not into Science Fiction and time travel usually fits into this catagory. Second, as a general rule, although I like Nora Roberts books I do not like JD Robb books (one and the same author!) and I was afraid this would be more of a JD Robb type book. However, I'm a HUGE Nora Roberts fan and decided to give it a whirl.<br />What a wonderful surprise.<br />In the first story:<br />Caleb in some strange way ends up traveling from the future to our time. The lovely, independent Libbie helps him thinking he's a plane wreck victim. The way Caleb reacts to common items in our century is funny. I found myself laughing several times. I particularly liked the ending.<br />In the second story:<br />Jacob travels through time on purpose in search of his brother. While Jacob is waiting for his brother (Caleb) to return from a trip with Libbie, he slowly begins to fall in love with fiesty Sunny. I liked the ending of this story even more than the first story.<br />I appreciated the true to life feelings that Nora is able to depict in her writing. I also appreciated the fresh look at our century.	2001-09-11

I find that most of her books depict emotions very well and that I am able to easily place myself in the character's position (even if I don't have ballet experience). I also like how Nora Roberts has trilogies and series that build upon each other so that I am able to revisit favorite characters through other novels.<br />These two stories are right up there with previous experiences reading Nora Roberts books. In other words, I enjoyed them very much.<br />I particularly liked the drive that Lindsay shows in the first story. I admired her strength as a woman. I appreciated Seth and how much he added to Lindsay's life.<br />I have to admit though, of the two stories, the second was my favorite. The strong willed, tempermental Davidov appealed to me, as did Ruth who didn't back down from what she wanted.<br />Because these are two stories bundled into one, they are shorter than many of Nora Roberts novels. This limited the depth of character that is typical of Nora Roberts longer novels. However, just because I would catagorize this as a lighter romance as compared to her longer novels does not mean I don't like this book. I enjoyed both stories a lot.	2001-09-11

However, because of the author, I decided to try and was thrilled I did.<br />Kelsey and Gale and true to life love, what a wonderful combination. What an interesting beginning to find that her mother who she though was dead is alive. It grabbed my attention and kept it through out the whole book.<br />This book is not to be missed.	2001-09-10

This is one of the funniest of the bunch.<br />Stephanie Plum is a bounty hunter. Her grandmother is too much. Her grandmother is a bounty hunter wannabe. I love her grandmother, she wears wild clothes, carries a gun, and says the types of things we all want to say. Her mother is the worrier of the family and as one reads these books, it's easy to see why.<br />I woke my husband up laughing so hard. I lent this book to my mother and my dad decided to read it to find out what was so funny. What a great book.<br />I don't know how many cars Stephanie can blow up, I hope to find out as the series continues. As she searches for her missing Uncle Fred a host of funny things happen to Stephanie. She has an on and off romance with a cop, her incredibly sexy fellow bounty hunter seems to want to have a romance of some sort and a small person camps out at her house and won't leave. To top all of that off, everyone carries a gun, including her grandmother and Stephanie always manages to leave hers in the cookie jar.	2001-09-10

She gets a little help from her sometimes cop boyfriend Joe and fellow bounty hunter the sexy Ranger. She gets a little help from her pistol packing granny who isn't afraid to tell it like it is.<br />I don't think I have laughed harder when reading a mystery book. What a wonderful combonation. The grandmothers antics in the funeral parlor are a riot. The romance between the cop Joe and Stephanie keeps me hoping they get together because together they are hot. The sexy Ranger, the bail bondman, and all the other characters only add to the story.	2001-09-10

I have enjoyed every one of the Stephanie Plum books. I think that I have woken my husband up laughing out loud while reading every one. Just thinking about them makes me laugh. Even the dog is funny. My mother and I discuss them and all we have to do is mention a character and we laugh.	2001-09-10

Although I enjoyed this book, I think it was my least favorite book. Mainly because I found the characters hard to associate with. The larger than life TV star using the ever grateful reporter seem very implausable to me. The long distance romance between the two lovers seemed just as implausable to me.<br />However, it is a good book in the true Nora Roberts fashion- not too mushy, full of true to life love and a great mystery.	2001-09-10

Mr. Bruns backs up his writing with documentation which makes it all the more interesting. He also does not get bogged down in consequences if the almost event did happen.<br />For example, he writes about John Lennon and the consideration of deporting him. He provides the documentation to back this up and does not get stuck in the trap of trying to explain what would have happened if John Lennon really had been deported. The assumption is the reader is intellegent enough to thing through many of the consequences of this. He also provides a snapshot of what is happening at this time in history that places this consideration in perspective rather than leaving it as an isolated event.<br />I enjoyed this book a lot.	2001-09-10

The interviews with prostitutes, pimps, visitors and musicians that lived and worked in Storyville make this book interesting.

Loewen provided the background for why certain monuments were built or how history came to be viewed incorrectly. His essays about why we should work to change many of these Historic markers and how to go about this are very thought provoking. Very interesting. I read almost all of it, not just the places I have visited or want to visit. Negative: I must say that I did find this book to be very preachy. Loewen's attitude that Americans (particularly white European descendants)treat all minorities with disrespect is incorrect. He seems to feel that many of these historic markers were deliberately wrong in order mislead the people, oppress minorities, and in general promote lies and ignorance about minorities. I disagree with this attitude and dislike the smug way he points it out over and over and over again through out the book.<br />I would suggest that this is a very good book to buy if you are interested in learning the truth about much of American history, particularly if you like to travel. Each state has at least one marker that Loewen has discussed. However, I would also suggest that the buyer be aware that there is a condescending attitude within this book.	2001-09-10

However, even her not so wonderful books are better than most of the romance books available.<br />I think what turned me off on this book was that it seemed unrealistic. It was hard for me to envision myself in the characters place, which is something that usually Nora Roberts does well. Also, the characters came across as being much more interested in  money and the things money can buy rather than the more important things in life. The heroine was rich and rich and that was about it. The hero wanted to be rich and that was about it.<br />Not one of my favorites, but again- much better than many of the sloppy in your face romance for sex purposes books.	2001-09-10

The characters are fun and true to life. I liked Julia and her son. I also liked Paul.<br />I rated this a four instead of my normal 5 stars for Nora Roberts books for two reasons: I found the romance true to life, although a bit forced at times since Julia didn't quite trust Paul. I also found that there were many more characters than normal and I had a hard time following all of them.	2001-09-10

The romance wasn't sloppy and the mystery was tidy.<br />I have to admit that I was a little bit reluctant to read this book when my mother handed it over to me. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about an older couple solving mysteries. What a pleasant surprise. I'm going to buy any other book Abresch writes, it was that good.	2001-09-10

Several times my husband made me read passages to him so he could hear what was so funny, and I have to report- he laughed out loud as well.<br />Stephanie Plum is looking for Mo the candy store owner. She certainly doesn't let the fact that EVERYONE she knows is telling her he's not the type to do anything wrong stop her. She doesn't let the fact that everyone is calling her mother stop her. She has a job to do and do it she does.<br />As the bodies pile up and the tension between her and Joe M. build, Stephanie does her job. The mysterious and sexy Ranger, Lula the ex hooker, the hilarious grandmother, worrying mother and reticent father all add to the book.<br />I can't think of a series of books, in this genre, that I have enjoyed more. Rather than passing these on to my mother, I bought her the same books so I don't have to share. They are that good.	2001-09-10

Both are very good in typical Nora Roberts fashion.<br />However, because both of these stories are shorter than the normal Nora Roberts books, the characters tend to fall in love faster and it is much less realistic than her longer stories.<br />The added drama of a missing jewels is what ties these two stories (and the others in this series) together.<br />In the first story- C.C. and Trent are fun to read about. They are opposites and prove that love can conquer all. The second story about Amanda and Sloan I found very enjoyable because of their constant sniping at each other.<br />As an added note, it is best to read these and all of the Calhoun Women books in order.	2001-09-10

I am glad that I bought it. I found many useful checklists in it. I was able to use these checklists as a starting point to organizing many aspects of my life. I particularly found the checklists regarding safety deposti boxes, first aid kits, and finances very important to have.I also appreciated that she provided extra resources for more information.<br />I had two complaints about this book which is why I rated it a four instead of a five.<br />-The checklists cover too broad a range of information- from How to unclog your sink to how to pick a lawyer to first aid kits. I think this book would have been stronger if it had zeroed in on two or three types of checklists (finances and survival for example) and left the others out.<br />- The author felt the need to explain many of the items on her checklist. Sometimes these explanations were necessary and important and provided more information about something. However, many of these explanations were unneccesary.<br />I would suggest that this is a good book to have if you are trying to organize your life and your environment.	2001-09-10

I believe that it is important for children to be exposed to a wide variety of experiences. Unfortunately, we live close to only one small museum. By using this book and the companion postcards books (bought seperately), I have been able to introduce my young son to many different pictures that he would not have seen otherwise.<br />This book is the companion book to postcard sized reproductions. This book explains how to introduce children to art without turning them off. There are several levels and different 'lessons' in each level. However, these are NON Stress 'lessons' (for lack of a better word). My son, who is two, enjoys looking at the pictures and talking about them. He has also enjoyed matching the pictures and I look forward to continuing this with him.	2001-09-06

This book was a sure winner for him. What I did not expect was that his dad would love it and I would as well. It is safe to say that we still enjoy this book even after reading many times each day and many times before bed time.<br />The drawings are creative and the text only adds to the wonderful artwork.<br />This is a must have for any children's library.	2001-09-06

Because of this, I tend to pick up books about Louisiana, particularly Louisiana history. I bought this book because I liked the pictures. However, once I began reading this book, I realized that there was much more to the cemeteries than interesting statues. I can honestly say that I enjoyed reading this book and found it as informative as it was interesting.<br />This book begins with an introduction about cemeteries in Louisiana and then covers different cemeteries in Louisiana. Generally there is a history of the cemetery, an accounting of some of the more famous people buried in each cemetery and a lot of information.<br />For someone visiting Louisiana, particularly someone who is considering a tour of the cemeteries, this book is a must.	2001-09-06

I found this book to be one of the best books yet by her. I like the stories although they sometimes get a little bit depressing. Sometimes it seems that everything happens all at once to this poor caterer Goldy: death and murder, grouchy son, business in trouble etc. However, it all seems to even out in the end. I also like the recipes. I would suggest all of her books.	2001-09-05

Although each book can stand alone.<br />Three sisters  grow in self knowlege as they forge bonds among themselves. During this time, each woman begins to find a special man that helps her develop and grow emotionally. What a wonderful set of books.<br />I have to say that this is one of my favorite trilogies and strongly feel that any one of these books are great reads.	2001-09-05

If you are interested in introducing your young child to art, this whole series is very good. Based on post card sized reproductions that kids can touch and manipulate, this book takes the parents/pre/elementary teacher through a series of activities that will help both adult and child alike learn about art. This book is the companion to the postcard reproductions. It explains why you should do an activity and how to do each activity. It is simple and straightforward. My only thought is that if you do this and you buy the books of postcard reproductions that go along with this program, you are into the whole thing for about 80 bucks. However, you do not need to buy all the books of postcards.	2001-09-05

What little bit of text there is does not detract from the pictures. My two year old loves to &quot;read&quot; this book. He even recognized &quot;gone&quot; when the train is gone. <br />For any child who likes trains, this book is a must. Even children who are not into trains will enjoy this book because of the interesting pictures and easy 'story' to follow.	2001-09-05

Everything I have tried has turned out well.	2001-09-05

I picked this book up mainly because I love her works. However, this book grabbed my attention and kept it riveted. I had a hard time putting this book down.<br />As expected the three daughters bond together. However, this book is much more than a book on sisters and families. This book is a mystery with some romance weaved in.<br />I enjoyed this book and have read it several times since the first time I picked it up.	2001-09-05

After a while, I feel that this author gets bogged down in rough times. I would like to see her son grow up a bit and be a bit more enjoyable. In the end everything seems to even out, although they are not always happy endings with everything all wrapped up in a neat bow.<br />However, having said that- if you want an easy to read book with yummy recipes this is a good book to read.	2001-09-05

I picked up this book so that I could answer my husbands questions about how other people handle homeschooling in high school with transcripts, college entrance requirements etc.<br />I have to say that I found this book to be one of the most useful books I have ever read about homeschooling. I would suggest that if you are considering homeschooling that you look at all of Mary Pride's books.	2001-09-05

They take you on a wild romp through the streets with Evonovich's hero- Stephanie Plum.

Having said that, this book is a wonderful book. If you love books about sisters and the ties that make a family, this is a very good book to read. Three women are fathered by the same man, although one girl has a different mother and is raised in a different country. This book is the story of how these three come together and learn to live with each other.<br />Add in the romance that is typical of Nora Roberts books and you have a real winner. I hate to see her books end.	2001-09-05

My friend suggested these. OH MY GOSH- I am hooked.<br />I woke my husband up laughing so hard at parts of this book. The grandmother of Stephanie Plum is a riot. She says the kinds of things that we all want to say and don't dare. The main character is kind of a mess at times and yet somehow things seem to work out.<br />If you want an easy to read, funny book; this is the book to get. If you want something with deap meaning and lots of themes, don't bother.	2001-09-05

This series of three books about three sisters was the first set of Nora Roberts books I ever read. I fell instantly in love with the characters, the setting and the story line. I was sad to see the end of this book and immediately began looking for more Nora Roberts books.<br />If you enjoy reading books about women who overcome their self doubts and many obstacles to become successful in their own way and content with their life, this book (and the others in the trilogy)is one you should read. It is also a romance novel full of the realistic ups and downs that many relationships suffer.<br />Nora reminds us success is not always monetary, that it is important to have love and many obstacles can be overcome.	2001-09-05

Anything by her is great. Having said that, this trilogy is one of the better ones by her, I think.<br />Each book can stand alone and this one about Margo does just that. This book is about starting over, taking the bad and turning it into something wonderful. This book reminds readers that money is not everything important and that there are other more important parts of life: family, love, friendsip, respect, and a positive attitude are some of thesee.<br />If you like reading a book about families, sisters and friends, this is a great book to read. If you enjoy reading books about how one strong woman can turn around a bad situation into something positive, this is a wonderful book.	2001-09-05

It is possible to feel the tension as each character strives to learn about (or cover up) the past.	2001-09-05

In fact, this set was my introduction to Nora Roberts and I have been a big fan ever after.<br />If you enjoy Nora Roberts books, you will enjoy this one.<br />If you have not read any Nora Roberts books, you are in for a treat. The way Nora Roberts weaves romance with healing, familial ties, and Ireland is wonderful.<br />Although this makes a great bathtub book, it is much more than that.	2001-09-05

There was a great section for parents and helping parents learn to accept their child's abilities and disabilities. I bought this book for myself and later lent it out, I never had it returned. I talked my school into ordering one for every Special Ed teacher in our school. All of us have found this to be an excellent reference.	2000-10-21
