The reason I rated this book 4 Stars is that it has 200 puzzles<br /><br />of 5 levels of difficulty.;and 40 puzzles of each level.Therefore, a pretty good book for someone looking for more puzzles.<br /><br />  However,there has been no attempt to give hints or methods for solving.That alone makes this not the book to buy for a novice  to solve Sukodos.There is a bit of history on the puzzle but very weak and doesn't give the impression that the puzzle was around in the US in the 70's, picked up by a Japanese puzzle book editor and taken back to Japan.It became a very popular alternative to our Crossword puzzles as their language doesn't lend itself to crosswords.<br /><br />  The book is a good size,but the puzzle grid could have been larger as it uses only about 2/3 of the page.<br /><br />  Overall, not my first choice for a novice.For some better choices see my reviews of Aug 3 (2 books),Aug 6,Aug 10,and Sept 30.	2005-10-04

In my humble opinion Mordecai was one of the most interesting and colorful characters that Canada ever produced.No doubt,anyone who ever read anything he ever wrote or ever listened to anything he ever said,either loved or hated him.Especially those people who were pompous,stuffed shirts or otherwise full of themselves would be setups for him to tear  into shreads and leave in tatters.Quebec language idealogues,righeous Jewish who set rules for him,or in fact anyone who managed to get his goat,was fair game for his satiric target practice.<br /><br />  I have read most of his novels and being about his same age,plus having had a friend who also grew up near where Mordecai did ,and also lived in Montreal,for quite a few years,I am able to relate to so much of what he wrote about.Reading Richler one can really understand what it was like to live in<br /><br />Montreal,what being Jewish,French,English,subserviant,or an outright rebel really meant.You couldn't,or would you want to be anything but what you decided to be.Mordecai reminded me of my friend and even myself when I lived there.I first came to Montreal in 1959,and being from the Maritimes,and not speaking French,was automatically classed as English,particularly by the French.One day this guy tells me that I have a poor attitude for a person living in Quebec and being only a minority.I told him that that if I was the only person in Quebec who didn't speak French,I wouldn't consider myself a minority.I don't think he,s gotten over that yet..but that's his problem,not mine.<br /><br />  Meanwhile,back to this book,the author has given us a very deep insight into the personality ,thinking and character of the Mordecai we all,at least some of us,came to love from his writings and gut renching statements he entertained us with for a time that was all too short.I often wondered what he would have been like as he grew older.You know,Mordecai never really got older,his knife just got sharper and sharper.<br /><br />  Some of the comments from the family,friends,business associates,croonies,etc are priceless,such as:<br /><br />  \\"That is what should be on his tombstone:\\"Here lies Mordecai,a mazik par excellence.\\"<br /><br />  \\"He died too soon.\\"<br /><br />  \\"He's laughing up his sleeve.He's putting it on for them.\\"<br /><br />  \\"He was an ond fashioned heterosexual male all the way  through.\\"<br /><br />  \\"But he never forgot he was a Jew.He was buried in a plain wood coffin.\\"<br /><br />  and a couple by his editorial cartoonist friend,Terry Mosher:<br /><br />  \\"The air of fame is heady.Make sure you don't inhale.\\"Mordecai didn't inhale.\\"<br /><br />  \\"A lot of people complain and bitch.They're whiners,but they're not rascals,and he was a rascal.\\"comments from the family,friends,business associates,croonies,etc are priceless,such as: <br />   \\"That is what should be on his tombstone:\\"Here lies Mordecai,a mazik par excellence.\\" <br />  \\"He died too soon.\\" <br />  \\"He's laughing up his sleeve.He's putting it on for them.\\" <br />  \\"He was an ond fashioned heterosexual male all the way  through.\\" <br />  \\"But he never forgot he was a Jew.He was buried in a plain wood coffin.\\" <br />  and a couple by his editorial cartoonist friend,Terry Mosher: <br />  \\"The air of fame is heady.Make sure you don't inhale.\\"Mordecai didn't inhale.\\" <br />  \\"A lot of people complain and bitch.They're whiners,but they're not rascals,and he was a rascal.\\" <br />	2005-10-02

This is an excellent follow-up to \\"The Art of Optical Illusions \\" by the same author in 2000 and which was voted BEST BOOK for young adults in 2001 by the American Library Association.The only thing I can say about that is, don't let yourself think this is a book just for Juveniles.  See my review for that book dated Feb 26,2005.<br /><br />  This book is very similar in concept ,but has a whole additional array of 137 new and different illusions.To anyone who likes unusual art,graphics,and the various art forms that comprise the world of optical illusions;you'll love this book.There are a raft of books that include some illusions and even some that are full of them;but none that show the breadth asd variety that Seckel gives us.He must have spent an enormous amount of time searching for these examples from the works of artists all over the world and from many past years and centuries.<br /><br />  While these illusions easily grab the attention of people of all ages and artistic as well as technical background;Seckel gives explanations,at least where they can be explained,to tell what makes the illusion work.<br /><br />  It wouldn't be fair to review this book without commenting on the supurb quality of the graphics,paper,color rendition,printing and overall construction of these two books<br /><br />  If this book has been as enjoyable to you, as it is to me,may I also recommend \\"Masters of Deception\\" also by Al Seckel.See my review of it Dec 1,2004.<br /><br />  With all of these Optical Illusion books by Seckel,its a thrill to sit back and go through the book and come upon a whole new experience with each turn of the page.A sure pleasurable treat to anyone who enjoys the world of intriguing and unusual things.Or, if that's not enough,when coming across something strange likes to ask,\\"How did they do that\\"? ...well Seckel gives good explanations,if the reason is really understood.	2005-10-02

This is definitely the best of the Sudoku books I've come across yet.That is not to say the others aren't also very good,but this one has more puzzles,over 200;including easy,medium,difficult and super-difficult.Also included are the most extensive and detailed instructions and tips.The tips are given for each level of difficulty and therefore progress as one also progresses from the easy to the more difficult puzzles.Then at each level, Carol gives a complete step by step solution for a puzzle of that level.I don't want to give the impression that this book is any more complicated than others,just more detailed.It would be an excellent book for someone who is just getting started or who has been doing them for some time.<br />  I'd just like to throw in a couple of other thoughts.I first started doing Sudokus in May of this year when I \\"found\\" them in a local \\"freebee\\" newspaper.The first thing I found was they were too small and the newsprint was poor to write on and erase.So,for what it's worth ,I made up a blank grid 4 1/2 X4 1/2<br />inches,making each cell 1/2 X 1/2 inch .I put 2 of them on a sheet of standard white paper  8 1/2 by 11,and made a bunch of copies.By the way,I used a heavier line for the outside edges and the edges of what Carol calls mini-grids or as I call them, blocks.Then, I transfer the numbers to my sheets to work on.I use a fairly bold marker to fill in the given numbers.A double check here ensures you haven't made a mistake copying the numbers.This emphasizing makes it easy to keep the rows,columns and mini-grids separated.<br />By marking in the \\"givens\\" boldly, it keeps them obvious from the \\"possibles\\" or \\"found\\" solutions.It also allows one to return to the book later and redo puzzles or to pass on to someone else.Another thing,I've found that a mechanical pencil,with its thin replaceable leads (no sharpening) and an \\"eraser pen\\" with a replaceable eraser is the best to work with.<br />  Another different feature of this book is the bit about keeping score.Carol gives points for scoring times,which by the way, increases with the puzzle's level of difficulty.It might be fun to see how you've improved when you return to these same puzzles a few months later.Again,your times against yourself or Carol's suggested times.<br />  You might want to check out the reviews I've written on other Sudoku books on Aug 3,(2 books),Aug 6 and Aug 10 of this year.<br />  Good Sudokuing!!<br />P.S.<br /> Carol has just published a new and better Sukodu book.See my review of November 16,2005.ng score.Carol gives points for scoring times,which by the way, increases with the puzzle's level of difficulty.It might be fun to see how you've improved when you return to these same puzzles a few months later.Again,your times against yourself or Carol's suggested times.

That says it all in Texas	I must admit, right off the bat,I've never heard of Molly Ivins;but I sure know who she is now.I loved this book from beginning to end.What this book is,is a collection of her columns from a Texas newspaper 'The Fort Worth Star-Telegram' during the 1990's.She cut her teeth on journalism working for peanuts on a little Texas leftist paper called 'The Texas Observer'.<br /><br />  She is an avowed left wing liberal and makes no bones about it;and you can't fault anyone for being honest;which more than anything else she is.If you ask me,I would call her down home Texas Redneck.She came from an upper middle class family.Her mother was a lifelong Republican;but as she maintains on page<br /><br />118 that \\"there's nothing you can do about being born a liberal-fish gotta swim and hearts gotta bleed\\".On page 206,she also talks about a group of people who want Texas to separate,as being \\"born in a state of high indignation and profound misunderstanding\\". So it seems that this trait in leftists is inbred;I guess that explains a lot.<br /><br />  When her columns deal with Republicans,she can see no good and when she deals with Democrats she sees no wrong;and even if there is,it's the devility of the conservatives at work.Hey,I'm not faulting her for that,that's where she comes from,and more power to her.At times I get the impression she is a Texas Redneck and strives hard to be a liberal at the same time;not an easy course to sail.<br /><br />She's at her best in writing about Texas politics and comes up with much better lines when on home turf.If she comes up short sometimes ,it's that liberal trait of believing that politicians and government will look after her and all the ills.This is an approach that always leads to disappointment whether one is left or right wing inclined.<br /><br />  This book was published in 1998,while Clinton was still President and little did she know what disappointments were lying in wait.She was also very surprised that Richards had lost to George W Bush as Governor of Texas.The liberals are great in deluding themselves,and that was just the start of things to come.If someone told her at the time, that GW wound not only win the Governorship of Texas but would go on to win the Presidency--twice;she would have thought them ridiculous.Again,they deluded themselves over Gore and Kerry being unbeatable.Let's not even talk about the Terminator and his Democratic wife in California.<br /><br />  There is no reason to lose any sleep over why things turned out that way.All she has to do is to call Rush and he will explain it to her.But therein lies the problem,she knows what he would tell her,and since she could never believe him, the libs will continue  their worn out tactics.<br /><br />  Another thing she had no inclination of when she wrote this book is that something even more prepostrous was in the future.Kinky Friedman is now running for Governor of Texas and he says if elected he will put his friend Willie Nelson in charge of ATF(Alcohol,Tobacco &Firearms).Willie has been pretty opposed to Bush,so that must make him a liberal and Kinky is a Jewish boy from the Village in New York come Cowboy and writer and that sounds kinda liberal as well;so we could be in for some interesting times.Hey,Jessy Ventura,The Terminator---and now the dynamic duo of Kinky and Willie.Buy the way, Kinky tells us the Jews and Cowboys have something in common---\\"we both wear our hats indoors\\".He also has a idea of replacing the Star of Texas with the Star of David.<br /><br />Molly reminds us on page 200:<br /><br />  \\"Before you accuse me of hopeless parochialism,consider the<br /><br />  one great truth that all Texas liberals grasp in their  cradles:Things Can Always Get Worse.In fact,they often do.Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to rejoice now,because these will turn out to be the Good Old Days\\".<br /><br />  Hey,it ain't over yet.I am going to read another book by Molly published in 2005,\\"Bushwacked\\",this should be a humdinger too.And if I'm not mistaken,I think I saw another at the bookstore a couple of days ago.I saw another at the bookstore a couple of days ago.	2005-09-14

This is an excellent review of the character of President Reagan.Deaver probably knew better and had a better,longer relationship with Reagan than any other person than his wife Nancy.Deaver shows us what made this man such a great leader with deep convictions and visions that guided him while Govenor of Caliornia and for two terms as President of the United States.<br /><br /> Reagan's great intellect is demonstrated numerous times and while his political adversaries often deluded themselves into believing that he lacked the mental capacity to handle the job;it in many ways was his \\"ace in the hole\\".<br /><br /> While Reagan was a strong negotiater and an exceptional communicator,he was a peacemaker and not one to hold grudges or waste his energy with negativism.<br /><br />  Deaver reminded me of some of Reagan's words:<br /><br />  \\"The sky's getting bigger every minute.\\"<br /><br />  \\"America is a shining city on the hill,the last great hope of<br /><br />  mankind.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Mr. Gorbachev,tear down this wall.\\"--And he did!!!<br /><br />  When asked why he left the Liberal Democrats and became a<br /><br />Republican,he answered,\\"I didn't leave them,the Party left me.\\"<br /><br /> And this one I had not heard before:<br /><br />  \\"If you learn to love reading,you will never be alone.\\"<br /><br />Personal persuasion,not political manipulation,was the secret of Reagan's magic.<br /><br />  \\"Clearly,Reagan was the right man at the right time,and history will bear his name triumplantly.\\"<br /><br />  President Reagan was a real Class Act and one of the best of the 20th. century.<br /><br /> This book is an excellent portrayl of this great man.	2005-09-12

Not being a car buff,I had never heard of these two guys or their show Car Talk.The notes on the back of the book convinced me it might be a good read. I was very pleasantly surprised and thuroughly enjoyed the book from beginning to end.<br /><br />\  Particularly, their musings on the education system hit the nail on the head with me.I have been singing the same song for many,many years.Although there is a lot of humor in this book,there is a lot of deep down common sense in this book.Like the authors ,I had the benefit of attending university and earned a Degree in Electrical Engineering.There is no doubt in the minds of the authors that the stuff that is taught in schools and universities is selected by and for the educational establishment and not necessarily for the benefit of the student;and I am in complete agreement with them. I found most teachers were very defensive,and operated from a position of correcting rather than trying to inspire the student.Of course it is much easier and secure for the teacher to correct than inspire,and the system provides a perfect atmosphere for them.That may be well and good for the teachers,but the purpose of education is to serve the students,not the teachers and the establishment.<br /><br />  the authors cover a lot of everyday things in their Rants and Raves.Here are a few one-liners to give you a bit of flavor of their stuff:<br /><br />  \\"If you don't think too good,try not to think too much.\\"<br /><br />  \\"This touch-screen technology takes the multibutton philosophy<br /><br />  to a whole new level of stupidity.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Only the mediocre are always at their best.\\"<br /><br />  \\"If God had wanted me to run,he'd have had someone chasing me.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Do 2 people who don't know what they are talking about know<br /><br />  more or less than 1 person who doesn't know what he's talking<br /><br />  about?\\"<br /><br />  \\"Time is more important than money;you can always acquire more<br /><br />  money.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Enough is as good as a feast.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Man can't just sit around.\\"<br /><br />  \\"It's much more important to think about what you're doing<br /><br />  than doing it.\\"<br /><br />  \\"It means you got a perfectly right answer,but you asked the<br /><br />  wrong question.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Education should be a preparation for life-not preparation<br /><br />  for school!\\"<br /><br />  \\"Tell me,and I will surely forget.<br /><br />  Show me,and I might remember.<br /><br />  Make me do it,and I will certainly understand.\\"<br /><br />  And to top it off,he gives us the Murky Research firm of<br /><br />  Dewey,Cheetham and Howe and its director,Paul Murky.<br /><br />  All in all, a great entertaining and insightful read.can't just sit around.\\" <br />  \\"It's much more important to think about what you're doing <br />   than doing it.\\" <br />  \\"It means you got a perfectly right answer,but you asked the  <br />   wrong question.\\" <br />  \\"Education should be a preparation for life-not preparation <br />   for school!\\" <br />      \\"Tell me,and I will surely forget. <br />       Show me,and I might remember. <br />       Make me do it,and I will certainly understand.\\" <br />  And to top it off,he gives us the Murky Research firm of <br />  Dewey,Cheetham and Howe and its director,Paul Murky. <br />  All in all, a great entertaining and insightful read.	2005-09-07

I don't tend to read too much of this sort of thing,but this short book left me flabbergasted.The signs for a massive problem seem to be getting in place.This book was published in 1995,and probably the data was even somewhat out-of-date at that time.10 years has gone by and the population and fantastic economic development has continued to explode and no signs of any attempts to confront the impending pressures.In all the years that I have read books that attempted to forsee developing conditions and then to predict future events;I can't think of any prediction that was on the mark.That is not to say, that the problems aren't very severe;something will come about,but it will be completely different than the senario predicted.<br />  The book quotes a lot of facts and trends,suggests that it will result in very high prices for food,particularly grain in the future.I doubt it will be that simple,the extreme demand will be there and all the price increases in the world for the limited supply will not produce a solution.The book reminds me of the kind of thing one can expect from government and other bureaucrats;simply a definition of the problem ,but totally devoid of any solutions.<br />  Since it is not a subject I have read much about;I have not seen any data to show what the numbers are now,10 years later.I suspect the trends have continued unabated.One must consider that people are very resilient and can adjust to about any amount of deprivation until some event becomes the straw that breaks the camels back--then LOOK-OUT major calamity will occur;history has shown that to be the case time and time again.<br />  The author quite correctly reminds us that \\"Socialist ideology makes it easy to dismiss problems\\".\\"He also quotes Michael Teitelbaum, a demographer;\\"For Marx,the fact that people were producers as well as consumers meant that the resource limits emphasized by the classical economists could arise under capitalism,but not under socialism.\\"The folly of that thinking has been proven disasterous in the past,and it is likely to be repeated as long as China embrases socialism.<br />  The authors main point is that as a country develops,its people will want the best lifestyle possible.It is easy for the Chinese to see what is possible,as it is already realized in many countries around the world.The problem is that China does not have the resources,nor are there such resources in the rest of the world--and therein lies the problem.<br />  These numbers tell the story:<br /><br />  Annual Per Capita Consumption in 100 kilos<br />Country  Grain Beef Pork Poultry Mutton Milk Eggs<br />USA  800  42  28  44  1  271  16<br />Italy  400  16  20  19  1  182  12<br />China  300  1  21  3  1  4  7<br />India  200  -  0.4  0.4  0.2  31  13<br /><br />  Kinda scary,ain't itas been proven disasterous in the past,and it is likely to be repeated as long as China embrases socialism.

I'm amazed that nobody has written a review here for this book which is somewhat of a classic in its field.But, then again, I can also imagine people who are avid readers that would find no interest in how the book they are holding in their paw came into being,physically.<br /> This is an excellent overviev of what it was to be a book publisher,particularly in Britain.This book was first published in 1926 and revised several times up to 1960.It is heavily influenced by the authors personal experiences as a book publisher who worked the trade from the early part of the 1900's .He was the founder of Unwin and Co.Ltd.of London.He was President of the Publishers Assoc. of Great Britain (1933-5) and President of International Publishers Association (1936-8) He died in 1968.So he knew of what he wrote, and not surprising it was translated into fourteen languages and remains one of the best guidebooks to publishing truths.<br /> While many of the principles he discusses remain true to this day;this is a book about the past.It is 80 years since this book was first written,and almost 40 years since the author passed away.The business of books has changed so much since those days and in ways that would have been unimaginable to publishers,authors,distributors, sellers and readers of those times.In spite of that ,the principles are virtually the same.<br />  The author deals with the trials,tribulations,challenges,heartaches,satisfactions and<br />rewards of his era and the more they change ,the more they remain the same.<br /> While I have nothing to do with the business side of books,I have always been interested in understanding what goes on behind the scene that put the books I enjoy into my hands.<br /> A book covering the changes that have occurred ,and how and why they came about during the last 15 years would be interesting.<br />  A magazine ,Biblio in 1997,which I believe is now no longer published;ran these interesting stats:<br />  Book Sales  1991  1996  % change<br />  Independent Bookstores  32%  18%  -44%<br />  Chain Bookstores  22%  25%  +14%<br />  Book Clubs  17%  18%  +6%<br />  Discount Stores  7%  9%  +28%<br />  Other  7%  10%  +30%<br />  Food/Drug Stores  5%  5%  --<br />  Mail Orders  5%  4%  -20%<br />  Used Bookstores  3%  $5  +33%<br />  Warehouse Clubs  3%  6%  +100%<br /><br />  Wow, what changes,and that was 8 years ago,and probably even outdated, even at that.I wonder what the numbers would look now and in the future.<br />  Another interesting article in Writer's Yearbook in 1998 gave these stats:<br />  7 Basic costs of Book Costs<br /> Manufacture  10%<br /> Distribution  8%<br /> Marketing  7.5%<br /> Overhead  8%<br /> Author's Royalties  10-15%<br /> Retailer's Discounts  40-50%<br /> Profit before Returns  1.5-16.5%<br /> And that is what goes into getting a book to us readers.<br /> Thanks to all involved,especially the book buyers who decide what they want and how they want to get it.ent Bookstores        32%     18%    -44%      Chain Bookstores              22%     25%    +14%    Book Clubs                    17%     18%    +6%    Discount Stores               7%      9%     +28%    Other                         7%      10%    +30%    Food/Drug Stores              5%      5%     --    Mail Orders                   5%      4%     -20%    Used Bookstores               3%      $5     +33%    Warehouse Clubs               3%      6%     +100%        Wow, what changes,and that was 8 years ago,and probably even outdated, even at that.I wonder what the numbers would look now and in the future.

When I found this little book,I thought it was a typical 'Road Book';but it wasn't.The author is a small town newspaper columnist,and who is quite happy to live the simple small town life with a job he enjoys,a family he loves,a home he and his wife created out in the country;and that is about all he really yearns for---the simple life.The newspaper that employs him has had its ups and downs,and ownership changes as is so common these days;but through the years Johnson has survived it all;if sometimes only barely; but then that is all he really wants.He is basically a writer who writes a human interest column.He has come up with a novel method of searching out his subjects--he simply picks them at random from his telephone directly.What he finds is that he has an unlimited source of interesting people to write about and all within a short distance of his home.He shows that virtually everyone,and no matter how ordinary their lives seem to be,there is always something interesting about their life experience to write about.<br /><br />  That is about all there is to this book.Except for one thing.A few years ago a friend recommended that I read \\"The Stone Diaries' by Carol Sheilds.It was a very similar book,written about ordinary people and their lives.The one big difference is that Sheilds won a Pulitzer Prize for her efforts.<br /><br />  I looked up her book and read the Customer Reviews and they are very mixed.Some think the book was wonderful and really deserved the prize,while others just couldn't see where it was merited.<br /><br />  The two books are very similar and if you like Johnston's you are sure to like Sheild's.Likewise; if you find one rather mundane ;you're likely to find the other the same.<br /><br />  Here is what Johnson has to say in a nutshell:<br /><br />  \\"Over the better part of two decades,these people have confirmed the notion that everyone is worthy of the front page.Moreover,they've shown me how to appreciate the simple things we already have within our grasp and the exhilaration that comes with looking ahead-like to the next person who answers a random call.

I had this book recommended to me by a friend who has a deep interest in bears ,has travelled widely and seen and watched many up close in their natural habitat;including in Alaska.She has shown me photos of standing only a few feet from wild Grizzly bears.I could hardly believe it, when she told me how approachable they were for experts and the pictures convinced me.Not to say, that I wouldn't keep my distance and give them utmost respect.When she told me this was an excellent book,and that I would enjoy it,I knew I was in for a great read.In other words,since it impressed her so much,it was sure to be good.<br /><br />  I read a lot of \\"Nature\\" books and spend an awful lot of time outdoors birding and am very familiar with the enjoyment and spirituality one gets from that wonderous combination of people,animals, landscape,sounds and silence,weather and atmosphere,and all that is encompassed when one partakes in a relationship with nature.<br /><br />  The excitement one gets when finding something new or just observing something seen before, is undescribable; but Schooler does as good a job of it as any nature writer that I have come across.He writes from the soul and great love he gets from living.Yes,this book is about the Blue Bear,Alaska and his friend and soulmate Michio,along with many other things,but what he really is writing about is the great enjoyment life is if one really learns to appreciate it.From this book you should learn that it is not only in Alaska that such enjoyment can be found.It is in the desert looking at sunsets,cactii and Roadrunners,in the forest searching out a Barred Owl,on the ocean watching a Tropicbird,sitting at a campsite when a Moose appears,or watching and trying to identify up to 20 different species of Gulls around Niagara Falls in the winter when it is wet windy and bitterly cold;or any of the millions of things the Creator has provided.<br /><br />  I'd like to quote a few things that demonstrate the excellence of the author's writing skills:<br /><br />  \\"Everything always gets what it needs.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Home is not always a door at the end of a sidewalk.<br /><br />  Sometimes it is a broader place that holds the shape of the<br /><br />  sky,the water we drink,and the food that becomes the minerals<br /><br />  of our bones,Sometimes it is the sum of our experiences and<br /><br />  memories,and sometimes it is wherever we happen to be-if<br /><br />  we are with the right companion.\\"<br /><br />  \\"As a photographer,,\\"Michio taught me how to 'look' with<br /><br />  my eyes-- but as a friend,how to 'see' with my heart.\\"<br /><br />  An excellent read for anyone who enjoys life,and a great  eyeopener for anyone who thinks life is boring.riting skills: <br />  \\"Everything always gets what it needs.\\" <br />  \\"Home is not always a door at the end of a sidewalk. <br />   Sometimes it is a broader place that holds the shape of the  <br />   sky,the water we drink,and the food that becomes the minerals <br />   of our bones,Sometimes it is the sum of our experiences and  <br />   memories,and sometimes it is wherever we happen to be-if <br />   we are with the right companion.\\" <br />  \\"As a photographer,,\\"Michio taught me how to 'look' with <br />   my eyes-- but as a friend,how to 'see' with my heart.\\" <br />  An excellent read for anyone who enjoys life,and a great    eyeopener for anyone who thinks life is boring.	2005-08-20

I very nearly passed this book by, because of its title.I do not hold much stock in name calling as I find it is a fall back position to attack the person rather than the idea.It is more often used by losers who actions are the result of hate than reason.Much to my satisfaction,the author does not resort to name calling but uses the words of none less than Lenin who used the term \\"useful idiots\\" to describe those people in the West who fell for their(communist)lies and false statements of intentions<br /><br />and supported and sympathized them in the Cold War instead of their own country. The author also quoted Gilbert and Sullivan in Mikado with:<br /><br />\\"Then the idiot who praises with enthusiastic tone,<br /><br /> All centuries but this and every country but his own.\\"<br /><br />  The author demonstrates through excellent research and actual quotes from Leftists to prove how they have been totally consistent in sympathizing with the enemies of the Free World;in particular Communists,since WW11.She takes us through each conflict and shows how the leftist Politicans,Media,Academics,Writers,Entertainers and Film Industry has always sympathized with the enemy and instead blamed America for creating the problem in the first place.<br /><br />  With the collapse of the Soviet Union,largely due to the policies during the Reagan Presidency,and with nothing but obstruction from the Leftists,these people have continued to try to find some kind of success of Communism to point to,without success.<br /><br />  The Leftist approach to the War on Terror is following the exact same agenda as they used in the Cold War.Their basic belief is that all conflicts are nothing but the result of poverty and that poverty is always the fault of America.<br /><br />  The author does not make statements of generality to show where the Leftists stood.She names the people and quotes their own words.I have been a close follower of world politics and particularly the spread and eventual implosion of Communism and had forgotten so much of how the events unfolded add found the author did a great job of putting it all together in one short,easy to read book.<br /><br />  Just in case you don't realize it,we have more than our share of Leftists here in Canada.My simple litmus test to smoke them out is to ask a simple question.\\"Have you ever been to Cuba?\\" When they answer, \\"yes\\" then go on to expound what a super place it is,you get the feeling they believe they've been to the Promised Land.<br /><br /> A quote from the book describes them to a tee:<br /><br />  \\"The tide of history has washed over them like a flood,<br /><br />  yet they've stood their ground-- scarcely noticing that<br /><br />  they are all wet.\\"<br /><br />  Although the author had good reasons for the title;I would suggest that:<br /><br />  \\"The one most reliable product of Communism--Refugees.\\"<br /><br />  or,<br /><br />  \\"Leftists;Setting the Record Straight.\\"<br /><br />  or,<br /><br />  \\"\\"No Nation Ever Chose Communism.\\"<br /><br />  or even,<br /><br />  \\"Innocence is a precious quality in children.It is<br /><br />  less appealing in adults.\\"<br /><br />  or what about this,<br /><br />  \\"Democrats were not soft on Communism,they were soft<br /><br />  on Democracy--well not really!.\\"<br /><br />  might be appropriate.<br /><br />9of Communism and had forgotten so much of how the events unfolded add found the author did a great job of putting it all together in one short,easy to read book. <br />  Just in case you don't realize it,we have more than our share of Leftists here in Canada.My simple litmus test to smoke them out is to ask a simple question.\\"Have you ever been to Cuba?\\" When they answer, \\"yes\\" then go on to expound what a super place it is,you get the feeling they believe they've been to the Promised Land. <br /> A quote from the book describes them to a tee: <br />  \\"The tide of history has washed over them like a flood, <br />   yet they've stood their ground-- scarcely noticing that <br />   they are all wet.\\" <br />  <br />  Although the author had good reasons for the title;I would suggest that:  <br />  \\"The one most reliable product of Communism--Refugees.\\"     <br />   or, <br />  \\"Leftists;Setting the Record Straight.\\"  <br />   or, <br />  \\"\\"No Nation Ever Chose Communism.\\" <br />   or even, <br />  \\"Innocence is a precious quality in children.It is  <br />   less appealing in adults.\\" <br />   or what about this, <br />  \\"Democrats were not soft on Communism,they were soft <br />   on Democracy--well not really!.\\"       <br />  might be appropriate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />9	2005-08-14

In addition,it gives you 240 SUDOKU puzzles. In all fairness,to date ,there is not really much to pick and choose among the half dozen books at this time.However,I would not at all be surprised to see more books shortly;describing more sophistophed and speed enhancing methods and hints.<br />  In the meantime ,you should find SUDOKU puzzles in your local newspapers.To date, I have not seen any SUDOKU magazines on the shelves,but expect to see lots of them shortly.<br />  Don't overlook the Net though,there is lots of good stuff by searching under  SUDOKU.<br />  In the meantime ,GOOD SUDOKUING!<br />  By the way you might want to check out my other Sudoku book reviews on Aug 3 (2 books),Aug 6,Aug 10 and Sep 30 of this year.	2005-08-10

I tend to say to myself;\\"That was a good one,Ivan,what have you got for me now?\\".<br /><br />  I not only do puzzles,I also collect them and in my library have over 500 Puzzle books.Which brings me to one positive criticism.Several puzzles require one to cut up the book.To me that is a total \\"NO-NO\\".It would be so much more appreciated if those few pages that require removal were duplicated at the back,and could be removed,leaving the book in tact.<br /><br />  I am not going to describe the various types of puzzles,or even pick my favorites,because there are so many types and I enjoyed them all.If interested,you'll find the Customer Review I wrote on \\"The Hinged Square & Other Puzzles\\" on April 26,2005,among my reviews and which I also rated 5 Stars.<br /><br />  By the way,my title was taken from the book,see if you can find where.	2005-08-07

If there were no injustice and if there were no racism;there'd be no need for Al Sharpton.I have been seeing appearances of Al Sharpton for years but only in bits and pieces as doled out by the Party and Media.All presented with the air that he was just a lightweight and someone the Democrats had to humor for the Black/Latino vote;and not someone they had to take seriously. In this book we see a giant of a man who understands what a great loss it is to America to have somewhere in the order of 30% of the citizens excluded from what the rest of the people take for granted.Many people might think that Crime is America's greatest problem,but that is a minor problem compared to racism,prejudice,lack of opportunity,morality,marginalization and so forth that essentially excludes so many from what America is all about.<br /><br />  When you stop and think about it,95% of the Black vote has gone to the Democrats and a person like Sharpton is still not taken seriously.What must he think when hears the other leaders of his party,give lip service to his concerns,criticize the Republicans for not caring about anyone but themselves;and then see Powell and Rice in the Bush cabinet.<br /><br />  It's not hard to agree with the things Sharpton says,the real issue is how to correct them and what does it take for either of the two parties to have the will to make the changes.There are enough people who are being left out that need the changes Al talks about, that the only way they can get results is to vote for the party who will deliver for them.<br /><br /> Although Sharpton is painted as a Leftist;I think he really doesn't believe that big government,socialism,handouts,entitlements are the long term solution to injustice.In fact he suggests several times,empowering people to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps,is the answer.<br /><br />  It is hard to imagine any of those seeking leadership in the Democratic party providing the solutions Sharpton is looking for.<br /><br />  It is going to take a massive shift in the way government is elected and run.<br /><br />  Maybe something along a senerio like this.Al finally concludes that the Democrats have already been given the Black/Latino vote too many times without results.Let Sharpton approach the Republican party with that large vote support and broker a deal.How about this Rice for President ,use capitalism instead of socialist programs to effect change.Create a Secretary of Empowerment,whose mission would be to empower those who have been excluded to take responsibility for themselves.<br /><br />  Over the door of the office of Secretary of Empowerment would be enscribed:<br /><br />  \\"We may not have put ourselves on the floor,but we damn sure better learn how to get up.And until we do,the question remains,<br /><br /> 'Are we worthy of the legagy we inherited'\\".<br /><br />  To complete the picture the person sitting behind the desk in that office;who else but Reverend Al Sharpton.You don't think things would start to change!!take a massive shift in the way government is elected and run. <br />  Maybe something along a senerio like this.Al finally concludes that the Democrats have already been given the Black/Latino vote too many times without results.Let Sharpton approach the Republican party with that large vote support and broker a deal.How about this Rice for President ,use capitalism instead of socialist programs to effect change.Create a Secretary of Empowerment,whose mission would be to empower those who have been excluded to take responsibility for themselves. <br />  Over the door of the office of Secretary of Empowerment would be enscribed: <br />  \\"We may not have put ourselves on the floor,but we damn sure better learn how to get up.And until we do,the question remains, <br /> 'Are we worthy of the legagy we inherited'\\". <br />  To complete the picture the person sitting behind the desk in that office;who else but Reverend Al Sharpton.You don't think things would start to change!!	2005-08-07

The best part of this book is definately it's title.I have a fair sized library and a bit of a Bibliophile;so any \\"Books about Books\\" grab my attention.I have about 50 on this subject and there are a ton of one-liners scattered through them.<br /><br />  As I said a good title, but the book comes up real short.I found it reduced to $1 Canadian, which is 95% off the original price of $19.99 in Canada. So,what is the problem?First of all I read it in less than 5 minutes right in the store.There are only about 75 small,5\\"x6\\" pages and only a single one-liner per page.Each page is a photo with a saying in a box overlaying it.It obliterates the photo,but that is really not much of a problem since in most cases there is no coorelation between the photo and the quote ,anyway. And the photos are nothing special.<br /><br />  As to the actual quotes,they are not bad.How good they are ,depends on the reader.Here,a few for you to decide:<br /><br />  \\"J.K. Rowling just keeps getting better.\\"<br /><br />  \\"You definately don't have it,or you just can't find it?\\"<br /><br />  \\"I read all the Oprah books.\\"<br /><br />  \\"I try to memorize everything I read.\\"<br /><br />  \\"The thing I don't understand is,who writes these books?\\"<br /><br />  \\"I asked for a book on the Beatles and he sent me to the<br /><br />  nature section.\\"<br /><br />  Well,there,s 6 of them,and there's only 75 in the book,hardly worth the price. What's here could be put on a Greeting Card and sold for a couple of bucks.<br /><br /> Just for suffering through my rambling review,which took longer to type than the book took to read;here,s a couple from my own personal experiences.<br /><br />  I was in one of Toronto's most respected Bookshops a few years ago.I asked the clerk (and they were supposed to be good at this place) if they had any books on Games and Puzzles.I was floored by her reply.\\"I'm sorry,Sir,maybe if you tried a Toy Store\\".<br /><br />  Another day,while I was browseing in a fairly good sized Rare and Used Bookstore;I aked if per chance they had any books by one of my favorites,Erskine Caldwell.The reply I got was ,\\"Oh,you must mean Taylor Caldwell;sure we have several.\\" I said \\"No, I mean Erskine,you must have heard of 'God's Little Acre' or \\"Tobacco Road'\\"? Her reply,\\"Oh yeah,I've heard of those books but never heard of him.\\" I told her he was a contempory of and actually outsold Steinbeck at the time.She didn't reply ,probably thinking I was pulling her leg.<br /><br />  Oh well,that was all a few years ago,both stores have fallen victim to the Big Bookstore Syndome.<br /><br />  Can't say as I really miss 'em.<br /><br />  Anyway,that's what I think of this little tome;not bad ,I suppose, if you can find it at the price I did.d any books by one of my favorites,Erskine Caldwell.The reply I got was ,\\"Oh,you must mean Taylor Caldwell;sure we have several.\\" I said \\"No, I mean Erskine,you must have heard of 'God's Little Acre' or \\"Tobacco Road'\\"?

Two more SUDOKU books No.1 & 2 just appeared.They carry the name of the master puzzlemaker,Will Shortz who is  very well known to all puzzle enthusiasts (metagrobologists);especially crosswords.Will gives a short introduction to this \\"new\\" puzzle,which he shows us is not really that new.He's been in the game a long time and I think when he tells us something;you can take it to the bank.He thinks it is going to be as popular as were Crosswords in the 20's,Jigsaws in the 30's,and Rubik's Cube in the 80's.Rubik's cube came out 25 years ago;Believe It or Not!While it was a real craze,it was beyond the ability of most people.It has still got a following, and I attended a World Championship last year here in Toronto.The winner was a teenager from California who solved it in 16 seconds.One of the contestants he defeated was a college professor who competed in the First World Championship in 1981 and had been working on it all those years.Crosswords and Jigsaws can be done by just about anyone depending on the difficulty and patience and time.SUDOKU is also a puzzle that can be done by the masses but it also lends itself to speed competitions.If my memory serves me well;in competitions,the Sunday New York Times Crossword gets solved in 3 minutes. I think we are going to see SUDOKU competitions on TV very soon.<br />  Shortz tells us the name SUDOKU comes from the Japanese phrase \\"suji wadokushin ni kagiru\\" meaning \\"only single numbers allowed\\".He also tells us these puzzles first appeared in Dell Pencil Puzzles and Games Magazine; in May 1979, and that the inventor credited for them was Howard Garns an Architect from Indianapolis, who retired in the 1970's and died in 1981.He was 74 when he sold his first puzzle.These puzzles were called\\"NUMBER PLACE\\"The editor of a Japanese Puzzle magazine took them back to Japan and published these puzzles under the name of SUDOKU and in the last year have caught fire and have spread all around the world and finally coming back to where they started.<br />  The puzzles in these books were created by Peter Ritmeester.He is the General Secretary of The World Puzzle Federation which organizes World Puzzle Championships in which SUDOKU puzzles and variations on them have been popular for years.<br />Each book contains simple solution methods and 100 puzzles to solve .<br />  These would be great books to get started or as gifts to someone who is already doing these puzzles in their local newspapers or anyone who likes \\"to do puzzles\\".<br />  If interested,I have written Reviews on other SUDOKU puzzle books; see Aug 3 (2 books), Aug 10 and Sept 30.<br />  It,s now Nov 23,2005,and here,s a bit of an update.Several other Sudoku books and sets for Dummies by Will Shortz have appeared They are much like the first one.If looking for Sudoko books in bookstores check out the Games section.You should find over 20 different ones;great Christmas gifts and stocking stuffers.y started.

Already, my bookstore has several books,this being one of them.As with all of them ,we are given some hints on solving and this book does a pretty fair job.However;you don't need a lot of help to see how to do them, especially the simple ones.However;as you tackle the harder ones;here is where it gets to be real fun.<br />  No doubt;we are going to be seeing speed competitions,and probably they are already working on TV Game Shows.<br /> What more is there to say but that this is a great little starter book to get you on your way and in the game.<br />  I have just seen a 3rd. book in this series.I have written reviews on other Sudoku books and they all have hints for solving,but the hints in this series is the weakest.See my reviews  dated Aug.10,2005;Aug.6,2005 and 2 on Aug.3,2005.I just purchased another Sudoku book  yesterday, Sept.23,and will be reviewing it shortly.....done as promised,see the review on Sept 30,it's a real good book!eview on Sept 30,it's a real good book!	2005-08-03

Limbacher has put together an excellent analysis of what Hillary has been all about and what is behind the actions she has taken in the past and what will influence what she will do in the future.<br /><br />  Keep in mind,this book was published in 2003,and many might think that since the 2004 election has come and gone;it is a waste of time reading this book.Au contraire,Hillary is the same person with the same motives at work and it is even clearer to see through her now than it was 2,3 or 4 years ago.<br /><br />  The problem that Limbacher had with trying to figure out if Hillary would take her run at the Presidency was that Hillary couldn't have told him herself;even if she wanted to.She does not operate on any logical principles;only on what will serve her own interest at the time.This book alone, shows that to be the case time after time.Since she can't predict the outcome of events any better,and would never commit herself to a stand on any issue;her modis- operendi can only be to obstruct anything that might hinder her goal and stand back and abide her time until what she seeks is handed to her on a platter.<br /><br /> The Clintons have an iron clad hold on the Democratic party,and what the party does will only be what in in the best interest of the Clinton,s and whether that is in the best interests of the Party or the Country is a mute point.All one has to do is look at the past.<br /><br />  Haq Clinton stepped aside at the time of his scandle,Gore would have become his replacement,completed Bill's term and as an incumbent would have easily won the Presidency and maybe even a second term.How would that have benefited the Clintons? It wouldn't have,it would have benefited Gore and the Party not the Clintons, and that is the point.Again,in the year leading up to the 2004 election Hillary,took no stand on any major issue ,put herself behind no candidate,except tentative support to anyone who would keep the Party from concealing strength with one candidate.Since she concluded she could'nt win against Bush,her only hope was that nobody else would.If it happened,that would be the end of the Clintons,,possibly for two terms and that is an eternity in politics.As the election approached the final months, and while the debates seemed to favor Kerry,emphoria over expectations of winning was running rampant throughout the Party,the Clinton's presence became obvious by the absence of their involvement. This must have been frightful days for Hillary until Bush won and the election that she side stepped was over and done.<br /><br /> So what next? Nothing has changed;Hillary will bide her time,take no positions,make no decisions,keep her agenda to herself,obvious as it is,pretend to be all things to all people,and hope that by the time 2007 rolls around that the voters will forget the Clintons past,and if they still hold the Party in their grip;she will have the nomination,otherwise the Clinton's reign will in fact have ended in 2001.<br /><br />  It's all there in this book and easily seen if one wants to know what motivated and continues to motivate both Bill and Hillary.There's going to be more books like this one in the next couple of years.Look at the Customer Reviews on \\"The Truth about Hillary\\" by Edward Klein,and its still 2 years before the action is in full swing for 2008.<br /><br />  It's a Guarantee Hillary can hang in if you can;it's going to be interesting!oncluded she could'nt win against Bush,her only hope was that nobody else would.If it happened,that would be the end of the Clintons,,possibly for two terms and that is an eternity in politics.As the election approached the final months, and while the debates seemed to favor Kerry,emphoria over expectations of winning was running rampant throughout the Party,the Clinton's presence became obvious by the absence of their involvement.

I have been keen on all types of puzzles for about 60 years;and I really believe this puzzle is going to spread all over the world like nothing we have ever seen before.It first appeared to me only a little more than a month ago;and only in one \\"freebe\\" newspaper in the Toronto area,and in Canada,as far as I know.In that short time, it is appearing everywhere and getting the attention of virtually everyone.It can be done by people of all ages and regardless of language.I predict there are going to be speed competitions and TV shows very shortly.I was in my big bookstore a couple of weeks ago and no sign of any SUDOKU books in the Games section.Tonight, there were 6 different ones.<br />  They are all somewhat alike with a couple of hundred puzzles;with 3 or 4 levels of difficulty , and a section that gives hints on solving the puzzles.Learning how to do them comes very quickly.<br />  Of the several I looked at,I thought this one had a slight edge on instructions.This publisher ,\\"Penguin\\"has already put out its second book,which is a little better than the first on instructions.It also has a contents page where their first did not.Also different than any of the others, it explains a hint for those real difficult ones where you feel you're stuck and can't go any further.It is called the \\"Ariadnes Thread\\".It has a cool explanation of this term and should be helpful.This book,like all others gives solutions at the back.I am not sure they are necessary,as it is obvious when you get the solution and a completed puzzle doesn't tell you how it was arrived at. Anyway,I still reserve the right to change my mind about that.<br />  What more is there to say;give SUDOKUS a try;if you like puzzles,you'll probably love them as I do;and this is a great book to get you started.<br />  Oh Yeah,go look on the Net.A search under SUKODU will turn up lots of good stuff.<br />  In addition, I have written reviews on other Sudoku books on Aug 3,Aug 6,Aug 10 and Sept 30.	2005-08-03

I have enjoyed reading this sort of stuff ever since I was a kid and that's 60 years ago.This book is a bunch of short articles about people and things that have happened in somewhat recent history ,which will never appear in history textbooks,but very interesting nonetheless. If you read some of the other reviews,you'll see what some of these things are.There are about 30 weird items covered in the book.So,no need for me to repeat.<br /><br /> The interesting thing to someone like me who has enjoyed this sort of thing is what has changed so much by the people who dig up and publish this stuff.<br /><br /> I first got interested in this trivia by reading Ripley's Believe It or Not!.His cartoons were a daily and weekly sort of thing in  newspapers and read by just about everyone.He was the real inventor of this popular interest;that is he more than anyone else ,made it so popular.He travelled the world searching out the unbelievable,and because of that he was known as \\"The Modern Day Marco Polo\\".I have several dozen of his books and there are many Ripley museums and now even TV shows.Ripley was one of the most well known people and most interesting characters in the western world.There were many others who published similar stuff ;but none even came close to the 'master'.<br /><br />  A couple of things are interesting about this book.First ,the author is a relatively unknown and in no sense the 'bigger than life character' that Ripley was.Ripley had to travel the globe or depend on people to send him material.No need to do that anymore.A person needs only access to the net ,and away he goes.If you read something in Ripley,s,that would be about the end of it.Further information would be very diffult to come by,especially if one lived in a small town.With the sories in this book the author gives a lot of references which would lead one on to many ,many more, all from your desk and the net.<br /><br />  The author has a terrific web site 'Steve Silverman's Useless Information'jam-packed with similar stories.Oh,by the way,even though your local newspaper probably no longer carries the Ripley's Believe It or Not cartoons ,there is an excellent Ripley's Website that does.<br /><br />  I am glad someone still publishes this stuff as I've had a ton of enjoyment over the years reading ;Stranger than Fiction,Greatest Inventions,World's Biggest Blunders,Weird but True,Did you Know?,World's Dumbest Inventions,World's dumbest Criminals,World's strangest Places,and on and on. However,Silverman has shown how the Net has made the amount of this information that is available,virtually limitless.<br /><br />  As with everything,when something new comes along, something old disappears.<br /><br />With me,it's the characters like Ripley who are becoming the thing of the past,and I believe we are all a little poorer for it.-packed with similar stories.Oh,by the way,even though your local newspaper probably no longer carries the Ripley's Believe It or Not cartoons ,there is an excellent Ripley's Website that does. <br />  I am glad someone still publishes this stuff as I've had a ton of enjoyment over the years reading ;Stranger than Fiction,Greatest Inventions,World's Biggest Blunders,Weird but True,Did you Know?,World's Dumbest Inventions,World's dumbest Criminals,World's strangest Places,and on and on.

This book does an excellent job at looking how the Democratic Party attempted to win the 2004 election.The only thing I fault this book for is the title.The Democrats in no way carried out a conspiracy.They took on the task of winning and tried everything they could.In both the book and some reviews a few felt that the Democrats had no right to even try,but that is nothing but sour grapes and in no way suggested by the author or anyone responsible in either party.A good,no-holds-barred fight ,using any legal tactic or approach,is what should be attempted and the voters should expect nothing less.I don't think the author suggested anything else really took place by either side.What the author does show is what the Democrats tried and in spite of a Hurculean effort and on top of feeling they had done enough and had even convinced themselves they were going to win and easily; they lost the Congress,the Senate and the White House.This time there was no debate other than in spite of all their effort,the big question is why did they fail so badly.<br />  This book covers every aspect of the campaigns  but mainly deals with the fight for the White House and I think the author shows that Kerry vs Bush ended up being what the whole election was about.<br />  The Dems didn't lose due to a lack of Money,they had plenty.<br />  The Author didn't talk about the Debates.Just about everybody feels Kerry did better,is probably a better debater,but winning an Election is about a lot more than winning a Debate.<br />  The author did a terrific job on Michael Moore's movie Fahrenheit 9/11.He convinced me that this movie was not the great asset that the Left Wingers had convinced themselves it was.He shows it mainly had an impact on the already converted and little impact on the swing vote,and even that may have been a negative factor to the Democrats.He gives excellent numbers on performance on from all over North America.It was interesting to see that several of the best numbers came from Canadian cities and most of the other best results came from the more heavily left wing populated areas.In other words the already converted.I don't doubt that Kerry would have easily beaten Bush if the countries in Europe and Canada could have voted.That anti America and anti Bush dribble the Democrats take such great comfort in, has no impact on election day,except a negative impact to voters of the center.<br />  The author talks a lot about the Attack on 9/11.He shows how the Democrats and Soros in particular,didn't see it as all that devastating and that Bush's reaction was an irresponsible reaction.The voters felt otherwise and showed it on Election Day.<br />The nastiness of portraying Bush as stupid,comparable to Nazis and Hitler probably cost them a lot of votes from the center and clearly seen as 'beyond of the pale'.The party's excuse that it \\"slipped through our screening process\\" didn't hold any water.Calling Conservative press \\"digital brownshirts\\" was another Leftist masterpiece.<br />  The author covers it all in this book and in the end only confirms what more than a majority of the voters had decided after the long detailed and partisian campaign by both parties.They believed that Bush and his party ,rather than Kerry and his party were the ones they preferred to handle the Nations security and more closely reflected their views.<br />  There are probably a lot of Democrats who disagree with the author,but facts speak for themselves.cities and most of the other best results came from the more heavily left wing populated areas.In other words the already converted.I don't doubt that Kerry would have easily beaten Bush if the countries in Europe and Canada could have voted.That anti America and anti Bush dribble the Democrats take such great comfort in, has no impact on election day,except a negative impact to voters of the center.

I have been a big fan of Franken, and this is one of his best books,if not the best.Nobody,but nobody exemplifys Liberalism as well as Franken,and he should be the Democrat's choice to run in 2008.To choose anyone like they did in 2004 or others that are jockeying for nomination now, would be nothing short of an injustice. This book shows there is no topic that he doesn't have an astute knowledge of or an ability far exceeding the \\"luminars\\" who have hijacked the great Democratic Party of the past.Remember Kennedy and Truman ,then why not Franken?<br />  In the last Election ,the Democrats skated all over the map trying to tell what they would do to confront the War on Terror.Franken gives the solution on page 119.Just deal with Terrorists the same way as with disgruntled employees;study and smoke out your enemy,and find \\"places to hide  once the shooting starts\\".Another great asset he has over other candidates is being Bilingual;English and Profanity.He won't have to search for the politically correct name or description to tag someome who is giving him a hard time.He can respond with both barrels and they'll wish they'd taken their venom out on someone else.By the way,as you read this book,make a note of these names;they'll come in handy to you too.<br />  He has another great talent seldom found in Democrats;he can tell a Republican something and it will be listened to and acted upon.Look at his wonderful book,\\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\".Obviously,Rush read it,took action and look at the fine specimen of humanity he has become.See,he can even reach out to opponents,a crucial benefit to a President.If he has a little spare time ,he could do wonders for Ted Kennedy and even Michael Moore.He has also shown on page 109 ,that he understands the progression of life . If given the opportunity,he'll to breathe new life into the Party.His cycle of life \\"is not a steady progression,but falls into distinct phases:youth,middle age,old age,decrepitude,senility,round-the-clock geriatic care,and prolonged agony before death\\". After the last two elections it takes someone like Franken to keep the Party from sliding into the final stages of progression.<br />  Now,I believe Al has shown us his high intelect and superior grasp of wisdom.But even at that, he has one thing that is holding him back;and it is strikingly evident on the book's cover.Al,needs to do something about his hat.Remember President Kennedy and his top hat on Inaugration Day,President Truman and his hats,President LBJ and his Stetsons,Prime Minister Churchill and his Bowlers,and the grandest of all, Napoleon and George Washington.If any more is needed to convince him, think about Al Capone and the master of hats, Frank Sinatra (\\"The Way You Wear Your Hat\\".Then, there's President Clinton and his Baseball Hat..see what I mean?It just doesn't make it.<br />  Can you imagine President Franken holding a a press conference with the White House Press Corps.When being hammered by the press over torture of prisoners,he'll tell them what toture really is.I leave it to you to find it in the book.<br />  Anyway,Al has put it all in this great book;he's done his part;now it's up to the Party.<br />  A terrific book,a great entertaining read;especially for all those people and countries outside America;especially Europe,who think they know better how to run America than the Americans themselves.If they think they have all the answers,they have plenty to work on at home.Canada included!<br />  God Bless Americak geriatic care,and prolonged agony before death\\".

These days it's George Bush;yesterday it was someone else and tomorrow it'll be someone else again.Then they quickly defend themselves by saying \\"Some of my best friends are American.\\" Just think about any victims of hate;how many times have they heard this.<br /><br />  The author has covered the gambit of the Anti-Americasm that is running rampant today. The author suggests this is a rather recent thing,but it has been around from the early days of the founding of America.The large numbers that came to America ,came to escape the tyranny,oppression,privlege,persecution for many reasons,poverty,hopelessnes;and saw in America a chance to have a better life for themselves and particularly their children.Those who were the elite and cause of this oppression are the same  who foster this hatred today.This is very evident in this book when the author talks to the oppressed ,no matter where he goes,he finds they are not the ones that hate America.He finds they see America as their hope for the future.It is the elite in their countries who are preventing their progress.The reason this is so,is because to the oppressed, America,Opportunity,Freedom,Democracy,Free Enterprise,Hope,etc.,is their dream for the future. These same things are and have always been a threat to those elite whose very existance depends on their birthright and privilege and station in life.<br /><br />  The problem demonstrated in this boor which the Author seems to avoid is that the left wing liberals and elites have fallen for these Isms of failure and ignore the fact that wherever they have been tried they have failed ;for the simple reason that they don,t believe that the people who do the work and take the risk should reap the benefits.Their world is that of entitlements and what's yours is mine, whether I worked for it or not.If you doubt that ,just think of the past empires.That is what the old world of empires,royalty,position privelige was all about.That isn't and never was what Americans and their Government was all about.<br /><br />  I agree with many of the reviewers,that this book should get wide readership and thought.<br /><br />  This book reminds me of one I read back in the fifties,\\"The Ugly American\\" by Dan Flynn;and not much has changed except that Communism has failed and the same evils are still at work today;and that evil is not America.It was the hope for the future and still is.

First let me say,I read the 3 reviews and have nothing to quarrel about with any of them.This book has been around for a long time,must have sold a pile of copies to schools,libraries,the general public, and what surprises me is that to date only 3 reviews have been submitted.<br /><br /> I have a great interest in nature and science in general,and a fair sized personal library,which includes over 1000 Natural History books.Though largely birds,my books cover the gambit from the simple and general to the difficult and extensively detailed.Most are of the type amateurs ,enthusiasts,and nature<br /><br />lovers would own as opposed to what would be called college textbooks.<br /><br />  In fact;I own several by the Stokes.This book is very indicative of the books they have authored.They are about as basic as you can get.They are very easy to read and I say this as a compliment.They are written in both the dificulty and detail level of middle school (grade 6 to 9 )If this is what you want this book should satisfy you.However;if you have this book on your shelf,see an insect,and expect it to be much help in identifying or learning much about its behavior,it probably won't be much help.Nor could any book of this size be when it covers such a broad subject.In fact,even your everyday encyclopedias would give you more detail on any insect actually covered in this book,not to say anything about the vast amount not even covered.<br /><br />  There is a Bibliography at the back that lists a lot of source material but none are referenced in the text;and highly unlikely to be used by the readers of the book.<br /><br />  Sure,when one sees a common,strange or otherwise interesting insect,it would be nice to have a book to 'find out more';the information is available but because of the vastness of the varities ,it requires much digging.<br /><br />  Nature is fascinating and will provide much enjoyment but if you want any more than a cursury look,you only get out of it what you put into it.<br /><br />  Insects are no different than stars,they can be enjoyed and marveled at by everyone .<br /><br />  I have no intention in my comments to knock this book .The author has only tried to give the reader a glimpse into the world of insects ,and for no other reason to share his interests with others and to show what marvels await the curious.Insects are no different than stars,they can be enjoyed and marveled at by everyone . <br />  I have no intention in my comments to knock this book .The author has only tried to give the reader a glimpse into the world of insects ,and for no other reason to share his interests with others and to show what marvels await the curious.	2005-07-24

I think Kristofferson summed up Cash about as well as anyone I have heard.This book is an outstanding look at the life of Cash.I have read and wrote reviews on several,but I really feel this is the best.Some might feel that Turner spends too much time talking about Cash's Faith and his God;but to really understand Cash you must understand this part of him.Without his beliefs,there would be no Cash,and he would be the first to tell you.Not only that,anyone who really knew Cash would tell you that his Faith was his greatest gift ;bar none.Reading this book you will also learn that Faith was also June's greatest gift.<br /><br />  Turner seems to put his finger on what made Cash the Legend he became.I finished High School about the same time as Cash and was always a big fan of his.Sure, there were some times when things were not pretty.A couple of months ago ,I was at a table with the owner of a large music store here in Toronto.This man is about eighty and knows just about all there is to know about the music scene here in Toronto.I said,\\"you must have met Cash a few times?\\" \\"Sure,many times.I remember one morning when I was opening the store,he was sleeping in the entrance.\\"Like I said there were times like that,but they were greatly overshadowed by the great scenes Cash provided throughout his career;right up to the end.From the time I First saw him live in Montreal,in 1969, with the Statlers; to the day we all saw him at June's funeral, I never tired of him or June.<br /><br />  This book leaves you thinking that we never ever saw anyone even remotely like him and that is why he was so much admired by so many,both in the music business as well as those who enjoyed and loved him so well.I watched his last appearence on the Larry King Show,and it was amazing how compfortable he was with the questions Larry asked.No doubt about it, Larry was completely overwhelmed by Cash's faith.<br /><br />  We are all the poorer because he is no longer with us;but at least we still have his music to enjoy for many years to come.<br /><br />  \\"If America as a nation could speak...it would sound something like Johnny Cash.His voice was America's voice,just as America's voice was his.\\"<br /><br />  Turner has managed to bare the soul of Cash to all of us.So if you want to get to know what \\"The Man Called Cash \\" was all about,I strongly recommend you read this book.sic to enjoy for many years to come. <br />  \\"If America as a nation could speak...it would sound something like Johnny Cash.His voice was America's voice,just as America's voice was his.\\" <br />  Turner has managed to bare the soul of Cash to all of us.So if you want to get to know what \\"The Man Called Cash \\" was all about,I strongly recommend you read this book. <br />	2005-07-18

When I spotted this book,the cover ( the paperback edition shows a girl in a farm field ) was the thing that caught my attention.It immediately made me think of the Southern novels by Erskine Caldwell.God's Little Acre,Tobacco Road and many,many,more made him the best of the Southern,earthy novelists.For several reasons,he is almost unknown today ;but at his height he even outsold Steinbeck.The reasons why his works are hard to find,have more to do about bucking the establishment and political correctness and not over the supurb,quality,popularity and originality of his work.<br />  If one has read much by Caldwell;it is very natural to compare Southern novels with his.This book is an easy read and it did keep my interest; all the way to the end ,but I kept looking for more than there was there.<br />  For me,I have to feel the author's passion and experiences with the location,stories and most of all the characters.Caldwell lived and knew the characters in his novels and even when he created fictional characters they became real.<br />  Obviously,while Pruett is a well trained and literally connected author,there is no feeling that she ever really knew the people,or types of people, she developed in this book.<br />  Can a female writer compete with the likes of Caldwell,Faulkner and Steinbeck? Yes,I think so ,Margaret Mitchell immediately comes to mind.<br />  This book gives me the feeling it was written by a 'trained artist'rather than by one who 'walked the walk'.<br />  Maybe this is the quality of what one gets from the American Voice,Southern Exposure,Black Warrior Review and The Writing Group Book, Limestone and The Louisville Review;I don't know,not having read any of them.I think the success of great authors comes from life experience gained by living with the people not by being a writer-in residence in some center of literacy.	2005-07-14

What a coincidence that I finished this outstanding book on the very day that the Terrorists attacked London murdering at least 40 ,and injuring many hundreds of innocent people.<br /><br />  Several other reviewers have described how this book does an excellent job of describing all the events that have occurred since the end of WWII;so it is not necessary to repeat it,except to say it put all thes conflicts into perspective and shows how one event affects another.<br /><br />  It is also of interest that this book was published in 2002 and is just as relevant today.I can't think of any other book written since 9/11,that sums up everything involved with Terrorism dealing with both the causes as well as what must be done.<br /><br /> The author shows the heavy costs worldwide,add also shows how  the Terrorists have the economies of the West in mind,along with the hope of demoralizing the people.Over and over the author quotes bin Laden:\\"It's the Economy,Stupid.\\"<br /><br />  It is getting clearer every day that the partisian approach must be put aside and fighting the country and its War on Terror has to be taken for what it is;aiding and abetting the enemy.<br /><br />It is time to realize that it is not a Left or Right,Liberal or Conservative,Free Enterprise or Socialism,Rich or Poor.It is a Radical Religious intent to destroy the Culture,Freedom and overall way of the West.The quicker everyone in the West comes to believe this,the better.<br /><br />  Already we are seeing representatives from the Muslin world,appear on TV saying that they hope there won't be unfair reprisals taken against that vast community of Muslims who \\"deplore\\" these Attacks.Now is the time for all these \\"good\\" Muslins to stand up and take action to help route out these Terrorists.In other words it's time to tell the Muslin world as a whole that they must become part of the solution and acting as an \\"innocent and concerned\\" bystander is no longer an option.<br /><br />  The day of countries sitting back and spouting the nonsense that George Bush and the Americans are just getting what they deserve;is over.These Terrorist attacks have been going on for 25 or more years,in countries all around the world,long before President George Bush decided to do something about it.<br /><br />  Also if you hear people saying that the Terrorists are just paying Britian back for supporting Bush you'll find out from this book that that is nothing but an unintelligent,hateful line of rubbish.<br /><br />  This War on Terror is just like the Cold War and must be fought in the same way,because to lose is not an option.<br /><br />  So,if you thought the War on Terror is something in Bush's mind,the events of today should bring you back to reality;and a reading of this book will show you why.the nonsense that George Bush and the Americans are just getting what they deserve;is over.These Terrorist attacks have been going on for 25 or more years,in countries all around the world,long before President George Bush decided to do something about it. <br />  Also if you hear people saying that the Terrorists are just paying Britian back for supporting Bush you'll find out from this book that that is nothing but an unintelligent,hateful line of rubbish. <br />  This War on Terror is just like the Cold War and must be fought in the same way,because to lose is not an option. <br />  So,if you thought the War on Terror is something in Bush's mind,the events of today should bring you back to reality;and a reading of this book will show you why.	2005-07-07

This book is a real sleeper.I bought it a few years ago,and it kind of got lost;which isn't hard amongst 6 or 7 thousand in my library.Checking the Reviews,though there were only 2,they were good;but not one since 23 Jan 03. Well here's number 3!<br />When I started the book,I was not familiar with the author,although I had read his 'Route 66' a while ago and liked it.However; his name just didn't ring a bell with me.<br />  Within a half hour  I was really impressed with his observation storytelling and writing skills.In many ways he reminds me of one of my favorites,Larry McMurtry.<br />  One of the themes of his book is that most people don't know much about Oklahoma and believe not much ever happened there. One is soon dispelled of that idea as you get into the book .Oklahoma is just about in the center of America and just about everything that happened as the country developed was impacted by or on Oklahoma.Wallis reminds us that it was not even a State until it became the 46th in 1907.<br /> Oklahoma was the country of Indians,Woody Guthrie,Dust Bowl,Depression,Oil Barons,Bill Mauldin and the Fighting 45th Thunderbirds,Frontier Religion,Frontier Justice,Gangsters and Outlaws,Route 66,The Real Wild West and 101 Ranch,Illegal Booze,John Steinbeck,Football Legends, and probably the greatest Salt of the Earth people you could find anywhere.<br /> Wallis is a Journalist and writes with a flair that holds your interest so well you don't want to put the book down and are even wanting more when you reach the end.<br />  The book is full of facts,observations,quotes,real characters,and information you just didn't know or even thought of.<br />  For instance,We all know about Woody Guthrie,but how many know how little he was liked in Oklahoma,where he was born and raised?And did you know he was the waterboy for the footbaall team?<br />  There are many,many great lines throughout the book.Here's a few to demonstrate :<br />  \\"A million dollar deal cemented with a handshake.\\"<br />  \\"Types who enjoy nothing more than a barbacue over a heap<br />  of banned books set ablaze.\\"<br />  \\"Bakersfield became the third-largest city in Oklahoma after<br />  Oklahoma City and Tulsa.\\"<br />  \\"Oklahoma is one-eight the size of Alaska and more than twice<br />  as big as all of New England.\\"<br />  \\"More languages are spoken in Oklahoma than on the entire<br />  European continent.\\"<br />  Woody Guthrie was \\"Just a boy from Okaloma on a an endless<br />  one- night stand\\".<br />  \\"We don't like cities anymore.We don't like what the've<br />  become.\\"<br />  \\"Indian Territory  (Oklahoma) became known as 'robber's<br />  roost',and its sinister reputation spread faster than fresh<br />  gossip at a church supper.\\"<br />  \\"I've never hanged a man who came back to have the job done<br />  over.\\"<br />  Judge Parker (the Hanging Judge) :I sentence you to hang<br />  by the neck until you are dead,dead,dead.\\" \\"Farewell<br />  forever, until the court and you and all here today shall<br />  meet together in the general resurrection.\\"<br />  \\"Whiskey helps to kill the poison in the night air.\\"<br />  \\"As unpredictable as a cyclone,fierce as a blue norther,<br />  and wily as a prarie wolf,Jim Jordan has been a cowboy and<br />  trader for most of his years.He's a combination of Judge<br />  Roy Bean and Buffalo Bill,with a generous dose of saddle<br />  tramp mixed in for good measure.\\"<br />  \\"And the morning after a jug of that stepped-up moonshine<br />  was drained,the poetry of 'Amazing Grace' would still make<br />  a band of angels weep.\\"<br />  See what I mean,Wallis is is a super author and if you like this sort of observation,storytelling and writing; this book is a real treasure .g more than a barbacue over a heap     of banned books set ablaze.\\"    \\"Bakersfield became the third-largest city in Oklahoma after       Oklahoma City and Tulsa.\\"    \\"Oklahoma is one-eight the size of Alaska and more than twice     as big as all of New England.\\"    \\"More languages are spoken in Oklahoma than on the entire      European continent.\\"    Woody Guthrie was \\"Just a boy from Okaloma on a an endless     one- night stand\\".    \\"We don't like cities anymore.We don't like what the've        become.\\"    \\"Indian Territory  (Oklahoma) became known as 'robber's      roost',and its sinister reputation spread faster than fresh      gossip at a church supper.\\"    \\"I've never hanged a man who came back to have the job done     over.\\"     Judge Parker (the Hanging Judge) :I sentence you to hang      by the neck until you are dead,dead,dead.\\" \\"Farewell     forever, until the court and you and all here today shall     meet together in the general resurrection.\\"    \\"Whiskey helps to kill the poison in the night air.\\"    \\"As unpredictable as a cyclone,fierce as a blue norther,    and wily as a prarie wolf,Jim Jordan has been a cowboy and      trader for most of his years.He's a combination of Judge      Roy Bean and Buffalo Bill,with a generous dose of saddle     tramp mixed in for good measure.\\"        \\"And the morning after a jug of that stepped-up moonshine     was drained,the poetry of 'Amazing Grace' would still make      a band of angels weep.\\"      See what I mean,Wallis is is a super author and if you like this sort of observation,storytelling and writing; this book is a real treasure .	2005-07-02

This book was a complete surprise to me.It is only 133 pages and that includes Index,a Bibliography of 104 books,a fairly good Discography and a group of Exercises.Several illustrations are also included.<br /> The author has put together a simple and complete overview of the various aspects of what makes up Celtic culture.One can quite easily read this book in a couple of hours and be left with a feeling they have a fair understanding of what Celtic means but will also know that they have only taken a peek into the Celtic World.I have read many books about the Celts and their culture and think I will return to this one often as a brief reference.The only thing that would have improved the book would have been a greatly expanded index.There are enough names,places terms,etc.,in the book to expand the index many,many times.<br /> Much of the Celtic world centered around Kings.Here is what Matthews had to say about them:<br />  Discussing stories and legends--\\"They date from a time when the king was sacred:neither human nor divine,but sanctioned by the elements,the manifestations of the gods of the land,and by his relationship with the Goddess of the Land,or Sovereignty.\\"<br />  Matthews also does a great job of showing how the Celtic pagan religion and all of its beliefs were combined with Christianity and formed so much of our  religions, ,customs,traditions,festivals,superstitions and virtually every aspect of our culture.The power of the earth, through the 4 elements,Earth,Water,Air and Fire is also seen in many other beliefs including those of the North American Indians.<br />  If you have any interest in things Celtic,you'll find this little book a real gem and an excellent introduction to it all.	2005-06-29

I have been a puzzle addict for over 50 years ,have a collection of over 500 'puzzle books',and am continually adding to it ;particularly with the help of Sterling for the last several years.They deserve a big thanks for all their efforts.<br /><br />  A quick thumb through,actually usually 30 seconds or less,and I either buy it ,or pass it by.This one looked pretty good ,so now I have it.<br /><br /> As always, with Sterling,the construction the paper quality ,illustrations and color are supurb.<br /><br />  As I started going through the book,I was really enjoying it but as I reached the mid point ,I became less enchanted with it.<br /><br /> Here's why.<br /><br /> While many of the puzzles were familiar to me from other books and puzzle makers,many were simply a re-do of old classics.Even that was OK.As a matter of fact the puzzle on pge 131 was a very different take on the Tangram;At least I don't recall seeing it before. Also the maze on page 133 was also a good twist on mazes.The construction puzzle on page 119 was also different.The vanishing birds on page is just a re-do of Sam Loyd,s vasishing chinese man puzzle that has been done as Leprechauns,trees ,animals,and you name it.<br /><br />  So why only 3 stars?<br /><br />  Many of the puzzles require cutting up the book,an absolute  no-no to any book lover or making copies ,even transparencies;both black and white or color.Then there is the puzzle on page 60, a takeoff on a puzzle that is often sold as a jigsaw puzzle with a mylar coated cylinder included in with it.Then we get on page 152 one that requires 3-D glasses;like everyone just happens to have a pair in their hip pocket!<br /><br /> I hope I've made my point.This book should have come with separate pieces in a pouch or something like that;so they would be available to do the puzzles without a bunch of construction, negating the destruction of the book.At the very least ,there should have been a warning on the front cover.This is not a new idea and has been done many times before.<br /><br />  I am surprised the editorial reviews didn't pick op on this.The names of the two authors were unknown to me in the puzzle book field and they appear more to be into creating classroom aids.All the more so, this book would have been a much better product with the additions I suggest.<br /><br />  I think both young people in a class as well as adults would enjoy this great mix of puzzles; but if either a decision to save a small amount at publishing or just a lack of thought is the reason;what would have been a first class effort is just a so-so result.<br /><br />  the old adage certainly applies here:<br /><br />  \\"Anything worth doing is worth doing right.\\"br />  I am surprised the editorial reviews didn't pick op on this.The names of the two authors were unknown to me in the puzzle book field and they appear more to be into creating classroom aids.All the more so, this book would have been a much better product with the additions I suggest. <br />  I think both young people in a class as well as adults would enjoy this great mix of puzzles; but if either a decision to save a small amount at publishing or just a lack of thought is the reason;what would have been a first class effort is just a so-so result. <br />  the old adage certainly applies here: <br />  \\"Anything worth doing is worth doing right.\\"	2005-06-28

I just purchased this book and found it a surprisingly good and informative read.Worth every bit of the price.Like most people I get my information from the media and have also read many books on the War on Terror.<br /> The author has summed up what happened before 9/11 and shows that there was intelligence for several years to give great concern.However;preemption has not been the usual approach,particularly by the US.Sure,the Terrorists took advantage of this and attacked ,just as did Japan at Pearl Harbour.Whether the US should have attacked earlier is a mute point.<br /> The important thing is that the US is at war with  very elusive Terrorists, who play by no civilized rules of war;not unlike the<br />Nazies in WWII.Bush told the country it would be tough and long but the USA had no option but to prevail.<br />  Miniter has done a very good job of summarizing what has happened since 9/11.He details many successes about which the media has given very little information or coverage.I really feel they have done a poor job and it's hard not to believe it has been intentional.<br />  Unfortunaately, support for the war has largely been split along party lines.Osama bin Laden hates America and everything she stands for and does not differentiate between Liberals and Conservatives.<br />  This book covers the many successes and shows that the USA is on the right course and will win.<br /> I particularly liked Miniters comment;<br />  \\"If the Press had covered WWII the same as the War on Terror,Americans would have had no idea whether WWII was a hopeless cataclysm or a purposeful march to victory.\\"<br /> \\"Did President Harry S Truman know when the Cold War would end?No, he pursued it nonetheless, and so did 8 more Presidents and in 1989 the Berlin Wall fell.The War on Terror will drag on and like the Cold War will end abruptly.<br /> There are excellent appendices and extensive bibliography in addition to the documentation of successes.I am sure Miniter will be coming out with another book covering events since this book went to press.I know I'm looking for it.<br /> Beware those who keep talking Quagmire,time to cut and run,this is Bush's War, etc..This is a War on Terror vs Freedom and politicalizing it supports the enemy.Miniter shows the US is winning.<br />  Let Freedom Ring and God Bless America.s since this book went to press.I know I'm looking for it.

This is as good as any political book around these days.Franken is a crystal clear thinker and an articulate writer.I you want to know how and what a liberal stands for and how they think;you could not find a better person to explain their philosophy to you.The candidates who competed for the opportunity to lead the fight to dethrone Bush in 2004,as well as those now jockeying for position to regain power in the White House,Senate and Congress in 2008 couldn't and can't hold a candle to one of the most talanted exponents of liberalism around today.As you will learn in this book,unlike running for cover,when conservatives are around;Franken stands right up straight and confronts them head on.More than that he goes looking for them.<br />He doesn't follow the path of old dyed-in- the wool of both parties and put together a support team of political hacks,big names from business,party theorists,political organizers,etc.He 'takes the road less travelled'and creates a TeamFranken organization of fair and balanced thinkers,with integrity, with Harvard backgrounds;whose only purpose being to expound the truth and foster the goals of liberalism.<br /> So,why isn't he a major candidate or at least spokesman for the Democratic Party?He continually exposes the conservatives and their agendas,all in a manner that leaves them looking like a heap of fallen leaves in the autumn.You don't see the other shining lights doing this do you?They just cry and weep complaining they were victimised or misunderstood.No siree!,you don't get that from Al! Just let someone pull a fast one on him;he'll go after them like a fox in a henhouse.When he's finished they'll know what FOX really means!<br />  Also from reading this book,see why Limbaugh,Hannity,and O'  Reilly spend so moch time fighting Franken and essentially dismiss Clinton,Kennedy,Sharpton,Jackson,Byrd and other liberal luminaries.That's not really true,Limbaugh recently offered Sharpton,and Sharpton accepted,to come on to Rush's Show and learn how to run a good Talk Show.I guess Limbaugh wanted to raise the level of dialogue ,since the liberals are left standing at the gate on talk shows.Isn't it interresting that Rush made the offer to Sharpton;he wouldn't dare to make it to Franken,for fear of being shown up.<br />  Anyway, be that as it may, this is a real good read for anyone who loves politics;and particularly truthful politics--or is that an oxymoron?<br />  Oh yeah! a great cover on the book .Franken put pictures of his favorite Liars right on front of the book;Good Show! But how come he is right there with them,and most prominent of all.Is there a hidden message here,or did his good buddy O'Reilly pull another one?<br />  Grab the book,find a quiet spot,put your feet up and have a good read and and some good laughs.n how to run a good Talk Show.I guess Limbaugh wanted to raise the level of dialogue ,since the liberals are left standing at the gate on talk shows.Isn't it interresting that Rush made the offer to Sharpton;he wouldn't dare to make it to Franken,for fear of being shown up.

If you have a little trouble getting my title;you'll surely know what it means if you read this gem of a book.I have been an avid birder for close to 20 years.In that time I have compiled a list of nearly 600 species in North America,met and birded with hundreds of other birders,made numerous friends,travelled far and wide, as well as locally,joined several bird clubs,served on executives,read hundreds of 'bird books';and own around 1000 books dealing with every aspect of birdwatching.With all that;I am pleased to call myself a 'Bad Birdwatcher';even though I had never heard the term before.<br /><br /> What makes this book so good is that it does an excellent job of telling what birding is all about,the many ways one can partake in it,and what attracts so many to it.In other words,if you want to see what birding really is or want to give a friend a book to find out for themselves,what this birding you do is all about;then you won't find a better book .<br /><br />  The author is an experienced birder from Britain,and quite a bit of what he talks about is birding in Britain.Don't let that disuade you as he covers a lot of other countries and everything he says is applicable to any country as well as very good for a rank amateur to the most seasoned 'expert'.<br /><br /> He also talks about something I don't believe I've ever seen covered.He explains the reason for this interest in birds and not other animals,insects,and other species.That's not to say that some people get interested in butterflies,mammals,etc.;but birdwatching outstrips them all.<br /><br />  \\"Anyone who has ever gazed up at the sky or stared out of the window,knows something about birds.In this funny,inspiring eye-opening book Simon Barnes paints a riviting picture of how birdwatching has framed his life and can help all of us to a better understanding of our place on this planet.\\"<br /><br /> A great addition to the numerous bird books,but one that is different and has something to offer for everyone;be they already a birder or just interested.ady a birder or just interested.	2005-06-25

As you can see,I've written several Reviews on 'Joke' books.When I came across this one,I was intriqued.The few Russian jokes I've come across usually go something like this;\\"There were 3 guys on an airplane,an American,a Frenchman and a Russian....\\".This book promised \\"more than 1,500 original Russian jokes,quips,quotes and anecdotes,many of which have never before been translated to English\\".Well,the book certainly delivered.Very few were familiar to me.Some were quite funny but many were just not what we think of as Western humor.One has to remember,that Russia was taken over by the communists in 1916 and it is obvious from reading this book that communism has affected humor just as much as every other aspect of Russian culture.Reading this book one gets the feel that most of these jokes came down from some government department in charge of humor.That is the difference,here in the West,most of us hardly consider bureaucrats as a bastion of humor.Most jokes are about the government,shortages,drunkeness,ugly women,unfulfilled promises,hopelessness and avoiding military service.I was also reminded of a Korean friend ,when I asked him how come we never hear any Korean jokes.His answer was \\"When you live in Korea ,there's nothing funny.\\"<br /><br />  While giving a good sample of Russian humor,it's not the kind of humor you get on the Late Nite Shows,and definately not material for a stand up comic,unless planning a career in Russia or some  socialist country.	2005-06-23

A great book outlining the thinking of Bill O'Reilly.You no longer need to listen to NBC,CBS,ABC,CNN (Which I call the BNN,<br />or Bad News Network anytime it deals with America,her War on Terror and any idea more Conservative than Left-Wing Socialism,and dare I even mention moral values or Christianity).Our own government media,the CBC, is so left-wing their agenda doesn't even change when the government changes from Liberal to a wishy-washy brand of Conservativism. I suggest you read this book,as well as his other book , the Fear Factor,then listen to his show and make up your own mind about him;rather than swallowing what the media establishment 'spins' about him.<br /> I have been waiting a long time for my cable company to bring me Fox News ,and what a change from the others it is.No wonder the others are losing market share at such a rate.<br />  When O'Reilly gets a guest on his show he is only interested in getting him to explain his position honestly.Bill lets him and the guest know whether he agrees with him or not.That is the case with all his guests regardless of position on the issue.As a matter of fact,he enjoys a guest with an opposite view and respects him for it.What he doesn't care for is when the guest will not answer a question or gives it the 'spin' that<br />both O'Reilly and the guest knows is 'on'.That is when the interview is over and the guest is probably as glad it is over as are O'Reilly and the listeners.The guests know this before they even come on to the show.The other thing about his show is that he welcomes anyone regardless of their politics but many are afraid to appear ;that is much more than one can say about the other Network News shows.If you often get the feeling that the guests have discussed the questions  before the show and the the guest picks and chooses what can be asked;then maybe this is the show for you.<br />O'Reilly lists several if his beliefs and asks the reader to test him and to come up uith the appropriate ism to place on them.<br />  For instance;most people who listen to what is 'said' about O'Reilly would think he is a big proponent of the Death Penalty for the worst of the criminals.He isn't .However ,his ideas would be even more objectionable to his opponents,because their agendas are more interested in protecting and defending the criminal rather than the victim.On top of that they offer no viable solutions and spew (spin)their old worn out and failed rhetoric--but not on O'Reilly's No Spin Zone,they don't.<br />  Years ago there used to be a Talent show ,I believe it was called The Gong Show, that had a big hook come out and remove the contestant when the host and/or the audience had 'had enough'.Maybe O'Reilly should have a purple light or some sort<br />of spinner or windmill to turn on when the guest starts to 'spin'.The guest,the host and most of the listeners know when the 'spin' is on so why waste everyone's time.If its 'spin' you want,avoid the Fox Network.<br />  Thanks for changing things,Bill,and onward and upward.As we used to say in the Army,don't let the Bas---- get you down.Oh,yeah,Canada used to have an Army,but the Liberals took care of that.The reason Canada is not part of the coalition is because we simply don't have the personnel,equipment or training anymore.Our government maintains that the UN and countries like France and Germany are the ones to deal with the War on Terror.

When this trust is no longer warranted because of abuses;society fails.In this story we see a different thing.It is not a matter of \\"taking the Law into one's own hand\\";this is a case of \\"taking Justice in one's own hands.\\"<br /><br /> Several reviewers have commented on whether the book or the movie is better.I have to go with the movie.Other examples of this,in my opinion would be 'Mississippi Burning',and especially 'Gone With the Wind'.'Tora,Tora,Tora','The Bridge on the River Kwai','High Noon',also come to mind.As a matter of fact,I am hard pressed to think of a book that beats the movie.I guess that's because of all the sound and visual effects that film makers have at their disposal to add to the story.<br /><br /> As I am writing this review,it's interesting to note that a trial is just getting underway of Edgar Ray Killen in the murder of 3 civil rights activists which took place 41 years ago in Mississippi.Once again, will Justice be done and more important will Justice be seen to be done.<br /><br />  This book and movie is one of the best \\"trial\\"stories I've come across.	2005-06-15

This is an excellent book in all respects.It definitely ranks right up there with my all time favorites East of Eden and Gone With the Wind as historical fiction.Although I am not too much of a fiction reader;I read a lot of history and Celtic,Irish and Middle Ages are particularly interresting to me.This book deals with Irish history from 430AD to 1538 AD and concentrates mainly the Dublin area.To show how the people of Ireland ,their  culture,religions and beliefs were affected by a continual procession of invaders,Rurherford has created an amazing cast of lineal characters to show how the people were affected by the events that were imposed on them.These intruders ,without exception,came to plunder,conquer,rape,pillage,destroy and most of all to impose their values .Again ,without exception,they did it with distain for everything Irish.The worst thing about it all is that these invaders had so little to offer and history has shown that their values and cultures have been mainly discarded into the scrapbin of history.<br /><br />  Small and basically peaceful as the Irish people were, they fought back with all their might.History has shown that no matter how heavy handed the invaders were,they were never able to control the Irish.It took a heavy price but all invaders finally found out that;\\"The Princes of Ireland bow the knee to this lowborn fellow? Never.\\"<br /><br />  What Rutherford accomplishes so well is to put a human and personal touch to the cold dry facts and events of history.He creates Irish personalities in this period who are as true to life as Rhett Butler or Scarler O'Hara ,or places like Tara;that Margaret Mitchell did in that great American classic,Gone With the Wind.<br /><br />  Even if you shy away from 800 page novels,as I usually do;I strongly recommend this one ,particularly if you are interested in Ireland and the Irish People.	2005-06-12

Mc Murtry gets back to his first love --the Old West.It's obvious he has a great interest in the two people he considers the first super stars.No doubt there is a ton of stuff that has been written about the period after the Civil War,1865 and the end of the 1890's.Some of it is factual,and much is embellished.The whole country and much of the world had an appetite that was boundless for stories about the Old West.This didn't happen a lot of years after it was all over;the stories and books appeared as soon as the people started to \\"open the West.\\"This thirst is still alive today as evident from Mc Murtry's novels such as Lonesome Dove,the Berrybender Narratives and other series like Longarm,The Trailsman,Lone Star and Louis L'Amour.<br /><br />  McMurtry tries to sort out some of the fact from fiction about Cody and Annie Oakley.What he really does is to show how important Cody was in taking the subject of the Old West and bring it to life and then bring it to people across America and Europe. Without a doubt, his was a major impact.Try as McMurtry may,he finds it fairly easy to sort out Cody;but he ends up showing that Annie was a much more secretive person.<br /><br />\I found the book a great read and gave a good insight into the origin of the Wild West Shows,though Cody never considered his productions just a show.It is good to remember that McMurtry is first of all a storyteller and observer of historical life;and not a detective.He makes a good effort in showing how all the people got along with one another.I think the one thing that really comes through in this book is that all these characters are real flesh and blood people despite all the exaggerations and legends.<br /><br />  McMurtry includes a list of 41 Western Heros, Heroines and Villians and how long they lasted.What this list does is remind us that these people did not live that long ago;in fact many continued to live into the 1910's,20's,30's, 40's, and 1950.<br /><br />  One thing about McMurtry is how much his books differ;and this one is certainly different from anything else he has done.<br /><br />  Don't overlook the Bibliography of excellent books about Cody,Annie Oakley, Wild West Shows as well as some other good western resources.h his books differ;and this one is certainly different from anything else he has done. <br />  Don't overlook the Bibliography of excellent books about Cody,Annie Oakley, Wild West Shows as well as some other good western resources.	2005-06-09

Podhoretz's book is an excellent review of President Bush's time in office,the major challenges that were presented to him, and how and why he took the action that he did.All the time the biased media hammered away at the ideas and rhetoric that constantly spewed from the liberal leftists.This continual sniping and delusionary thinking is beyond the pale and the results of the 2004 Election showed that the leftists may have deluded themselves;but they couldn't delude the majority of voters.<br />  I must take exception to the statement on the book's cover;\\"How Dubya became a great President while driving liberals insane.\\" Yes,he has been a great President;but the liberals drove themselves insane.<br />  The leftists try to portray President Bush as some kind of a religious nut.He is an elected politician ,has deep religious convictions,a good family man,and has done everything possible to honor the office he holds and will do everything he can to protect the people of the country he serves.<br />  His off the cuff comment made amongst the rubble in New York after 9/11 showed where his mindset really is.<br />  \\"The ideological attack against Bush,however,is a different matter.Those who have argued out of deep conviction that Bush is a fool,a puppet,a fanatic,a Hitler-like figure,a betrayer of civil liberties out to end all social programs,a crazy cowboy,and a bald-faced liar have been infected with a strain of dementia that has been part of American political life since the nation's founding.This disease(to which ideological conservatives,alas,are as susceptible as ideological liberals)distorts perception,destroys reason,and makes rational discussion nearly impossible.<br />  Instead of what is being said about President Bush;why not listen to his own words.<br />  \\"We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescurers,working past exhaustion.We have seen the unfurling of flags,the lighting of candles,the giving of blood,the saying of prayers-in English,Hebrew and Arabic.We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own.\\"<br />  \\"Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom.Our grief has turned to anger,and anger to resolution.Whether we bring our enemies to justice,or bring justice to our enemies,justice will be done.\\"<br />  \\"I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it.I will not yield;I will not rest;I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people.The course of this conflict is not known,yet its outcome is certain.\\"<br />  President Bush has been crystal clear of where he wants to lead.The leftists have given no hint of what they would do.All they know is that they hate Bush.ave seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own.\\"    \\"Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom.Our grief has turned to anger,and anger to resolution.Whether we bring our enemies to justice,or bring justice to our enemies,justice will be done.\\"    \\"I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it.I will not yield;I will not rest;I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people.The course of this conflict is not known,yet its outcome is certain.\\"    President Bush has been crystal clear of where he wants to lead.The leftists have given no hint of what they would do.All they know is that they hate Bush.	2005-06-04

Jack Anderson claims to have done an investigative report on the NRA.What we really have here is a highly biased editorialization of the NRA,with every effort to make it look ridiculous,and just does a lot of derogatory name calling in an effort to convince the reader that there are logical arguments to prove his biases.He portrays the anti-gun people as racist,country bumpkins and if they were as intelligent and sophisticated as the elitist leftist establishment in the cities they wouldn't fight gun control.If Anderson would only get real he'd see that the criminial activity that takes place with guns is mainly in his astute cities ;and fighting the law-abiding,gun collector,target shooting and duck hunting gun owner of mid- America,from whence most of the NRA hails;will never solve the problem.He even admits that about half the households in America have one or more guns,however he rants on about the 3 million or so members of the NRA and ignores all the rest.He also rails about the the Second Amendment  rights. This is the real red herring issue;and I'll tell you why.In Canada there is no such statement of rights in our constitution,in fact,we don't even have one..The leftists and anti-gun lobby have pushed through gun control and registration and have created a 2 Billion dollar boondoggle,all the while promising it would not cost more than 2 Million,which would be covered by registration fees.That would be bad enough in itself, but there hasn't been any sign of any reduction in crime involving guns.Why would one expect there to be?Guns are still being used in crimes and to the surprise of nobody,except a few stary-eyed liberals,the criminal element continue to get guns as they did before.So,all this gun control is nothing but a red herring,the liberals have created to avoid tackling the real problem of crime, whether in the US or here in Canada.<br />  Now,instead of fighting the real enemy they make the NRA the enemy.<br />  One might find some benefit from all this gun registration,in that maybe the duck will feel better having been shot by a hunter with a registered firearm;but,somehow I doubt it.I also doubt that the next killing in some lonely alley or robbery will be by a criminal with a registered handgun.<br /> Why did I rate this book 5 stars?For the simple reason that it completely exposes the gun control elitests as hell bent on an agenda totally devoid of any likelihood of solving the crime problem with guns.<br />  Since we do not have an NRA here in Canada , we might as well blame the our gun control boondoggle on the NRA too.That would only be fair,since our liberals probably got ther misguided ideas from your liberals.<br /><br /> Update!  Update!  Update! December,2005<br /><br />  If you think all this is unbelievable;wait till you hear this!<br />Since the $2B boondoggle failed to acomplish anything as evidenced by the out of control gun related murders here in Toronto,now 'they'have decided to conficate all the handguns,that the law-abiding citizens dutifully registered.The only exception will be for persons working in security or otherwise OK'd by 'them'.Just to remind you that this changes nothing with the illegal guns and those used in committing crimes.Of all the gun related murders this year in Toronto,only one gun was one stolen from a registered owner.Could this confication been the plan all along?I doubt that these leftists could plan this far ahead,but it sure fits their agenda.Now 'they' are down to blaming the US for the problem.If that was the promlem,why didn't 'they' start there before spending the $2B?

Irish history is about as complicated as history can get.Vance deals with the period between 500 and 1500 AD.From the people who inhabited the island from the 500's we follow the changes that took place as a result of invasions,internal warring,spread of Christianity,colonialization by England and Spain,etc.<br />  Medieval Ireland was where the violent aftermath of the Reformation,the struggle between Catholic Spain and Protestant England,was played out.By attempting to become a vassal state of Spain,Europe's superpower and champion of Catholicism,Ireland became England's Cuba,an offshore island being secretely armed by a dangerous enemy.<br />  This book shows how the spirit of a people only becomes prouder and more determined to survive and flourish,no matter how much they are oppressed.<br />  Every aspect of life is dwelt with and the author shows how these things changed Ireland and made it what it is today.<br />Although this is a very difficult subject,the author manages to simplify it as much as possible and make it a reasonable easy read.The book is profusely illustrated with excellent color photographs, spectacular black and white drawings,maps and what appear to be excellent wood engravings.A first class Index and a Bibilography that will bedazzle any reader with an interest in Medieval history	2005-05-25

I read this book for one reason.I wanted to see why the Democrats have this guy for a poster boy and why his movie was so popular and to see why he was supposed to be so great at taking on the Republicans.In the months leading up to the Election the liberal elitist media were falling all over themselves with a continual tearing down of everything the Republicans had done in the last 4 years that it never occurred to them that the people already knew what they had done.What they were looking for from the Democrats was what they would have done or would do differently.Look as they may,it never came,and they re-elected President Bush,and in no uncertain terms.<br />  I was very disappointed in what Moore had to say.there is nothing new brought up or proposed ,just a continuing diatribe  of hate and anger.This is the same old,tired,mouldy anti-everything that has been preached by the left-wing liberal socialists for years.This is not the hope and promise and positive message that came from the Democrat Party of John F Kennedy.The Democrat Party has moved so far left ,wrong is a more appropriate description of it these days.<br />  The should have paid attention to President Reagan when asked why he left the Democratic Party.He replied;\\"I didn't leave the Democratic Party,it left me.\\" Can you imagine JFK readng the hate and anger that prevails throughout this book and wanting any part of it?<br />  Recently,a Democrat Senator stood before a group of students and called their President a loser.That displayed the lack of respect the Democrats have for the office of The President of the United States;and they wonder why with all the media support,campaign funds,Move On.org,etc;the voters said,No Thanks.<br />  Listening to James Carville recently it seems even he feels the Democrats have got to change if they ever hope to climb out of the abyss they have fallen into.<br />  There is an old saying,\\"Misery likes company.\\" Well I don't know about that .In Canada we once had a proud Liberal Party that got along well with the US,Republican or Democrat governments,but it has been hyjacked by a bunch of left-Wing Socialists,just like the Democrats.Sean Hannity was right on the mark when Moore quoted him as saying,<br /> \\"Canada is a left-wing socialist basket case.What kind of friends are they?\\"ty that got along well with the US,Republican or Democrat governments,but it has been hyjacked by a bunch of left-Wing Socialists,just like the Democrats.Sean Hannity was right on the mark when Moore quoted him as saying,   \\"Canada is a left-wing socialist basket case.What kind of friends are they?\\"	2005-05-24

A long time reader and buyer of Ripley,in fact ever since his first book;but I must say I was not impressed with this effort.I got the impression it was just pumped out from a stack of old files and maybe items that didn't make the grade before.Ripley,himself,was what made Believe It or Not what it was.He was a bigger than life personality and today there is nobody taking his place at Ripley's.This book reminds me of the numerous others that did take-offs of Ripley,and never came close to the master.Maybe if the resources were spent on creating a world reknown traveller,explorer of the unbeaten track;who could put the imagination back into the cartoons ,rather than trying to get by on marketing and graphics;we would get the quality product that made Believe It or Not what it was.This book appears to be something cranked out with minimal effort and imagination for the kids market.When Ripley was around his cartoons had appeal for all ages.<br />  I really believe a replacement for Ripley himself,who is a character himself,with widespread recognition,often appearing as a guest on talk shows,is what is needed to put new life and personality back into the cartoons.File,research,marketing,art and graphics departments just don't do the job.<br />  The daily cartoons in some newspapers and on the web site drawn by a John Graziano are an attempt to produce the cartoons;but who is he? One never had to ask who Ripley was,every knew who he was and he was as recognizable as Babe Ruth or the President of the United States.A long time tradion of Ripley was to show the name and town of people who submitted items.It seems he was much more involved personally with his fans than the unrecognizable \\"staff\\" we have today.I believe Ripley would have considered it only a common courtesy to recognize his contributors.Any long time fan knows how much people,mail and fans meant to him.<br />  See my other reviews on Believe It or Not books dated 13 Jan 2004 and 19 Jan 2005.	2005-05-22

The editorial reviews are real good on this book and I won't repeat the same,just no need to. Also, the first customer review is a real good effort ,especially for someone who appears somewhat of a birding novice.Lisa AA has posted her 1st review, and I would like to commend her on her efforts.She very well shows that this book can be of interest to anyone who enjoys life,people and also the world of birds.I have the same experience when people who learn that I am into birding.Everyone seems to be fascinated about my interest,has a million questions and are amazed over the interest,sport or even the obsession that it can become.Questions like, \\"You mean you would drive 500 miles,just to see a bird;and it might even be gone when you get there?\\" As you will see, if you read this book;that can just be the start of it.<br /><br /> Of course ,not all birders can,or even begin to take on this interest the way world lister birders go at it.Some \\"bird\\" in their own back yards,towns,county,state or province,country,ABA (which takes in all the continental US,Hawaii,Alaska and Canada ,and then there are those tha make the whole world their target.What this book does is to give one an idea of what this pursuit can be all about.<br /><br />  The people who take up birding come from all walks of life,all ages, all abilities,all financial backgrounds.The one thing they all have is the desire to see as many birds as possible.Whether it is as simple as adding the number 78th bird to their yard list or the 4078th to their world list,the pleasure is the same;only the scale differs.<br /><br />  While the author centers on his father,he also discusses a lot about Phoebe Snetsinger ,who held the record of seeing the most birds in the world at the time of her untimely and unfortunate death.It just so happens that I know,and often bird with a lady who knew her well and was on the bus with her when the accident occurred.<br /><br />  I also knew another \\"Birder of the World\\",as is incribed on his tombstone.Norm Chesterfield held the world record for 7 years into the late 1980's.What a great fellow to talk to and what stories and experiences he had.He even went to Vietnam while the war was on.Just imagine,this little old man ,well into his 70's, birding while the the war was underway.He complained \\"the birding was lousy;too damn much shooting and banging going on.Couldn't hear nothing (birds singing).\\"<br /><br />  I guarantee anyone who likes birds,enjoys the outdoors or wonders what this obsession with birds is all about will love this book.<br /><br />  While most of us can only dream of what these World Listers do, we have to be content to read about it and dream ;or grab the bins and go see what's around.as is incribed on his tombstone.Norm Chesterfield held the world record for 7 years into the late 1980's.What a great fellow to talk to and what stories and experiences he had.He even went to Vietnam while the war was on.Just imagine,this little old man ,well into his 70's, birding while the the war was underway.He complained \\"the birding was lousy;too damn much shooting and banging going on.Couldn't hear nothing (birds singing).\\"   <br />  I guarantee anyone who likes birds,enjoys the outdoors or wonders what this obsession with birds is all about will love this book. <br />  While most of us can only dream of what these World Listers do, we have to be content to read about it and dream ;or grab the bins and go see what's around.	2005-05-21

Bush.These men and their families know what it means to practice honor,integrity,and duty to their country.The people of the US,who gave them the honor to serve,see the strength of duty and conviction in their actions,and this is what they see in President George W. Bush and don't fall for the picture portrayed by the elite left wing media and establishment.There is no doubt that the Bushes believe it is a great honor to serve their country and they will do everything possible to ensure that they will do it to the best of their ability.Leadership and Statesmanship is one thing while politics is another matter.The Bushes are able to handle both and do it without being mean-spirited or nasty;even in times when things don't always go the way they wish.To them, a public office is a sacred trust and they will do everything in their power to insure that the office gets the respect it deserves.Whether or not you agree with President Bush on all issues,one certainly knows where he stands .He has proven to be a man of his word,will give it his best and along the way will do nothing to disgrace the  office he has been elected to hold.<br /><br />  There are a couple of thoughts the Bushes live by and everyone can benefit from them;regardless of their Faith or Politics:<br /><br />  \\"Doing what is right is what is more important than being<br /><br />  popular.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Principles matter a lot more than opinion polls.\\"<br /><br />  Keeping this in mind one can see The President lives by his convictions;and this is the foundation of greatness.This applies just as much to the cop on the beat,the teacher in the school,the coach on the sand lot and The President of the United States of America.It is what George W.Bush believes,practices and will be his legacy.	2005-05-21

An excellent book where the the author tries to answer the question if experts or the crowd are better at predicting the future or solving a problem.In all fairness the question is as open-ended at the end of the book as it was at the beginning.There are many examples of successes and failures in both cases.<br /><br /> As in most endeavors, the laws of science are just not applicable and try as you may,you'll not find a law or formula that always works.That is why Mathematics is the one true science,because it works in all cases and will continue to work for all time.When there is room for schools of thought,preferences,politics,beliefs,agendae,;certainty will always be elusive.The greatest example of this is in the realm of prediction.Prediction can never be a science,or else a set of rules or laws could always be used to make correct predictions;because if it were a science,like Math,there can be only one answer and it will always be correct.<br /><br />  That is why Political Science is such a misleading term.There is no science to this as there is no method or laws for certain predictions.Call it a science,if you want;but it remains a study,or at best an art and void of certainty.Even if some Guru or large mass of people were to predict an event , it would be as the author says,\\"the result of fortuitous circumstances\\",or more bluntly,luck.<br /><br />  I can't think of any real prediction that ever came true;<br /><br />and that the method was repeatable with certainty.While we sometimes hear that something was predicted,further study shows it was POSTDICTION.While entertaining reading,we all know that recent events were never predicted.9/11,Y2K,the collapse of the USSR,assination of JFK,the Presidency of George W. Bush (2 terms),The Internet,the latest Pop Hit,Movie or great novel,the Dot Com crash,occurrence or outcome of wars;none were predicted ,nor were they likely to have been.<br /><br />  Then there is speculation.The best example that comes to mind was Chester Gould,creator of the Comic Strip,Dick Tracy,and his 2-Way wrist radio in the 1940's.He had more vision than the giant communication industry,who could not begin to see the possibility of such technology.<br /><br />  Personally,I put more stock in the Adage,\\"If you take the generally accepted wisdom of the time,and take the complete opposite,you are more likely to get closer to the truth.\\"<br /><br />  For example;<br /><br /> WW1,the war to end all wars.<br /><br /> Russia couldn't win in Afghanistan;and neither will the USA.<br /><br /> The motor vehicle industry will come to a halt because the rubber will be depleted and we won't be able to make any more tires.<br /><br /> In the 50's, predictions of population explosions will mean the world will run out of food.So,where did the obese problem come from?<br /><br /> The Energy Crisis of the 70's suggested we'd all be driving around in tiny cars.So,where did all the SUV's come from?<br /><br /> At one time, the thinking was that the production of Iron would come to a halt because we were running out of OAK TREES to make charcoal for the iron furnaces.Yeah!<br /><br />  So maybe the Fortune Teller at the County Fair is no less an expert than the huge masses of predictors,planners , market reseachers,etc;and are just as apt to get it right or wrong.<br /><br />  Maybe the author got it right with his quote:<br /><br />\\"--all Smith had done was prove that the sun rose in the East.\\"of the Comic Strip,Dick Tracy,and his 2-Way wrist radio in the 1940's.He had more vision than the giant communication industry,who could not begin to see the possibility of such technology. <br />  Personally,I put more stock in the Adage,\\"If you take the generally accepted wisdom of the time,and take the complete opposite,you are more likely to get closer to the truth.\\" <br />  For example; <br /> WW1,the war to end all wars. <br /> Russia couldn't win in Afghanistan;and neither will the USA. <br /> The motor vehicle industry will come to a halt because the rubber will be depleted and we won't be able to make any more tires. <br /> In the 50's, predictions of population explosions will mean the world will run out of food.So,where did the obese problem come from? <br /> The Energy Crisis of the 70's suggested we'd all be driving around in tiny cars.So,where did all the SUV's come from? <br /> At one time, the thinking was that the production of Iron would come to a halt because we were running out of OAK TREES to make charcoal for the iron furnaces.Yeah! <br />  So maybe the Fortune Teller at the County Fair is no less an expert than the huge masses of predictors,planners , market reseachers,etc;and are just as apt to get it right or wrong. <br />  Maybe the author got it right with his quote: <br />\\"--all Smith had done was prove that the sun rose in the East.\\" <br /> <br />	2005-05-03

Hey,where to start in writing a review on a book about Comics, when one has been reading them for over 60 years.An excellent book in every way.Physically,this book is beautifully constructed,with top of the line paper,printing and color illustrations.A great dust jacket, as well as  glossy hard covers printed with comic strips.A large volume 10X14 inches,over an inch thick and 326 pages...WOW! By the way ,there is a companion book,which is just as good,covering Comics before 1945;same size and by the same author.<br /><br />  What great memories this book brought back.I was born in 1935 and was an avid Comic Strip reader of 10 where this book starts.<br /><br />  While there are many strips covered in this book that are unfamiliar to me,and probably to most people;all my favourites are there.All through the years,in my opinion the Strips and writers were at their best in the 40's and 50's.But then that was when they were really growing up and so was I.<br /><br />  My favourites were Dick Tracy,Little Orphan Annie,Li'l Abner,Smilin' Jack,Popeye,Beetle Baily,Joe Palooka,Blondie,Tarzan,Captain Easy,Mandrake the Magician,Mutt and Jeff ,Smokey Stover,Henry,Superman,Terry and the Pirates,Pogo and later Doonesbury.<br /><br />  Dick Tracy was my overall favourite,especially in its prime with super characters such as Flattop,Mumbles,The Mole,Brow, B.O.Plenty,Gravel Gertie and  little Pebbles,Pruneface,etc.,etc.<br /><br />  Then there was Li'l Abner with Daisy Mae and Ma and Pa Yokum.The nation wide craze set off by those wonderful Shmoos and then the creation of Sadie Hawkins Day antics that swept the schools and colleges.Nothing like that kind of stuff today!<br /><br /> I guess all this fun was just too much for the prudes of political correctness, and their misguided efforts put the end to it all.<br /><br />  At the height of the Comic Strip days,everyone was aware of the 'funnies'and knew all the characters.If you didn't know who Dagwood or Annie's dog Sandy,or Fearless Fosdick was;you just didn't know what was happening.There is nothing like it today.I found the papers kept dropping reader favourites,cutting back on the number of strips,introducing strips with agendas and social engineering,to the point many readers lost interest and abandoned them.<br /><br />  As a matter of fact ,I was really following only Pogo and Doonesbury for the last few years and sadly we have even lost Pogo.Dick Tracy is not even carried by out largest paper in Toronto.I just read the Tracy strips on the Net for 2005.Fletcher and Collins give it a good try,but the storylines and artwork fall way short of the master, Chester Gould.Not only that,punching the keyboard and reading the screen is a poor subsitute for sitting back with the funny papers enjoying a coffee after breakfast or dinner;again in my opinion.<br /><br />  This book also covers a lot of what I call cartoons,and does a great job of it,but cartoons just aren't what the world of Comic Strips was all about.<br /><br />Walker has also included a huge list of references if one wants to dig further.<br /><br />  This book should not be thought of as a review of any particular strip.It is really a history of Comics,a reference to use if one wants a quick look-see of what a strip looked like and a little about the artists who drew the strips.It also tells a lot about what went on behind the scenes with the artists,newspapers and syndicates over the years.<br /><br />  It also talks about Comics as an artform.Here I agree,one only has to look at how the artwork progressed in a strip like Dick Tracy and more recently Doonesbury,to see the advancement from very simple sketches to excellent art of colors, silhouette,perspective and all, to appreciate it.<br /><br />  After reading the book, I hope one day to visit the International Museum of Cartoon Art;although I continue to think of the Comic Strips as one thing and Cartoons as something completely different.<br /><br />  A great gift for a friend or yourself if you were a follower of the \\"strips\\".	2005-04-28

I watch CNN mainly for the facts but when Blitzer,Woodriff,Annanpour (sorry if the spelling is off)and a few others start asking leftist loaded questions,and otherwise liberal pontificating;I generally ignore them.I wouldn't mind it so much if conservative views were also given to put some balance into the discussion.Crossfire is at least an honest banter between openly leftists and conservatives.However, the pretention that there is no bias on Network News is demeaning.<br />  Rather than argueing that the biasis is there,Goldberg goes into why it exists and why and what should be done to correct it.<br />  I fully agree with Goldberg on what he says about Gun Control.He brings up many points that one never sees on the Network News.The point here is not if one agrees or not;the point is that both sides of an issue should be equally presented if the news source is to maintain credibility.<br /> If one wants to decide if there is bias in reporting,one has to ask only one question.Are both sides of issues equally presented.?That's up to the listener or watcher to decide;not the news team.<br />  Goldberg also discusses the sexual abuse problems in the churches and other organizations in a way one just doesn't get from the Network News.As a hint, have you ever given any thought to why it is with mainly young boys rather than young girls as well?<br />  Goldberg also goes into how and why these journalists get their bias and the liberalism of the academia who direct and instruct in journalism schools.The term Liberal Arts is much more of a statement of fact than one would like to admit.Again;ask the question;of the teachers and professors you know? How many are liberal and how many are conservative,and why is it thus?<br />  Goldberg also discusses Rush Linbaugh and quotes him as saying,\\"He is the first to tell you he is not in the news business\\".I've heard him say that on several occasions and state that he is in the Talk Show businss.Shouldn't others be just as open and honest?<br />Goldberg's book is full of quotes from all political stripes and one of my favorites was:<br />  \\"Everyone in the newsroom knows how the game is played.\\"<br /> Or how about this one?<br />  \\"We can't say anything negative about a group that supposedly needs our protection.\\"<br />  And finally;<br />  As Walter Croncite used to say,in today's media culture \\"that's the way it is\\".<br />  And you know what?

Finding this book was a real treat.I haven't seen much of his work for a long time.Little wonder,since Rube died in 1970.Goldberg is a national treasure,not only for his Inventions,but also for many other art forms.He graduated as a Mining Engineer,did Vaudville,wrote songs and plays,was in Motion pictures,Newsreels,Radio,and TV.He also took up Sculpture at the age of 80 selling about 300 works to private collectors,galleries and museums.<br /><br />  He created his own artform and was a resounding success by his early 30's and remained so the rest of his life of 87 years.His cartooning skills reflected the early years of cartoons where the message was more important than the artwork;which really came into its own and exploded after WWII.That is,more like the stuff we saw from Mutt and Jeff by Bud Fisher and R F Outault's Yellow Kid.Generally speaking,after the war,the great change in artwork after WWII became the world of comics,such as Dick Tracy by Chester Gould,Terry and the Pirates by Milton Caniff and what we see today in Doonesbury by Gary Trudeau.<br /><br />  I can't remember if I ever saw any of Rube's cartoons in color and there is no use or mention of color in the book.While he still produced well after color became popular in comics and cartoons,the question remains unanswered.On his website there is a Machine Contest 2005 in color,but it is obviously not his work.Does anyone know if any of Rube's cartoons were printed in color?<br /><br />  Overall,this is an excellent book and does a good job on the life and work of an artist who entertained so many for so long.	2005-04-19

The author puts forth the idea that the reason the terrorist attacks succeeded was because there was not enough security in place.This is what one would expect from a person who spent many years as a bureaucrat and is now selling security services.How much security would it take to ensure terrorists would be unable to carry off attacks?Most attacks took place on targets which had security measures far greater than what normal buildings and facilities have.The WTC had security and emergency plans which greatly exceeded that of normal office structures.The Pentagon and Fed bldg in Okla.,foreign embassies,ships had security above the norm.The terrorists chose to go through airports and use commercial planes and slipped through security totally undetected.It's highly doubtful that had all the things that the author suggests been in place,that the results would have been any different.What comes through in this book, is for a continuation of the same kind of \\"turf\\" protection and rehash of the same old uninspired thinking that you get from the establishment;and like any other area, there is a security establishment.So, the author is right is saying that security failed;it couldn't possibly work in the first place against determined terrorists;nor would what he proposes.<br />  The problem faced is to identify the terrorists,hunt them down and destroy them.This is going to require a no holds barred approach,since that is the approach used by terrorists,and it must be at the highest level.When terrorists come from outside the country and run back to them to hide,train,get financed,indoctrinated,supplied with weapons and otherwise supported; then they have to be pursued there or pressure applied to those countries to conclude that it is in their interest to do it.It will be obvious that those countries have gotten the message when their reaction to an attack is a determined hunt down of and elimination of the perpetrators.That does not exist today .What you get is a half-hearted condemnation,followed with a \\"but\\" then a long line of anti-american rhetoric.They have to be made to believe that a terrorist attack made by their people will bring a resounding reply .  Instead of pouring huge amounts of resources into defensive security that the author suggests,and won't work ;the need is to identify the enemy,and respond in quick fashion and in a manner that will convince the terrorists and their supporters that terrorism will result in a crushing response.<br />  The author also suggests that big efforts need to be made to \\"understand\\" the terrorists.Again,the bureaucratic approach.These terrorists and thir sympathizers are filled with hate and have clearly stated their aims of killing as many infidels as possible.Tell me,what is there to understand? Just like a serial killer,understanding him is not the issue;catching and eliminating him is.<br />  The whole approach in this book reminds me of the Gun Control  mess we have developed here in Canada.We have spent somewhere between 1 and 2 billion dollars on gun registration which doesn't work,hasn't got the guns out of the hands of the criminals and is nothing short of a fiasco.I shouldn't be too negative,I suppose,it has produced a lot of jobs for bureaucrats and consultants.Maybe the ducks will now benefit when shot by an approved and registered gun.It will have no effect on someone shot by a criminal, running around with a gun he has no intention of registering. War has been declared,and rather than falling back into defence,an all out effort for total victory is the only sensible approach.ed condemnation,followed with a \\"but\\" then a long line of anti-american rhetoric.They have to be made to believe that a terrorist attack made by their people will bring a resounding reply .

Another excellent book from the one who likes to lay it out like it is;warts and all. If you've read Death of the West and enjoyed it;don't miss this one.<br /><br />  Buchanan doesn't sugar coat things the way most politicans do.He analyzes things and shows what is right and wrong ,why,and what should be done to correct it.This is not a good formula to get oneself elected as his past has shown.If he were to get elected,no party could stand him,and he would have to be an independent.With the 2 party system,an individual who talks the truth becomes a problem.<br /><br /> In this book, he takes on issues and faults the Republicans,(neo-cons);for instance the War on Terror.The leftists will cheer him for that,but since he doesn't think the left has any answers,he doesn't think things should be turned over to them;therefore the left must continue to hate him.<br /><br />  Buchanan outlines the most serious problems facing America today and in general suggests that America's approach should be more like Reagan's successful conservative approaches than the leftist,european,let the UN take charge approach.<br /><br />  Buchanan was right on with Death of the West and I can't think of anything that he was the least bit wrong about.I suspect he is on target with this book.It will be interesting to read either of these books 10 to 15 years from now;so put your copy away for future reference.<br /><br />  Buchanan deals with issues that are here now and suggests changes that need immediate action.His quote by Victor Hugo is very approprite,\\"You can resist an invading army,you cannot resist an idea whose time has come.\\"<br /><br />  With respect to the gutless idea of political correctness,he asks,\\"Can we defeat an enemy that we are afraid to name?\\"<br /><br />  As the liberals continue to look to the left,many Democrats have finally given up and have moved to the Republicans.This has resulted in the Republican party losing some of its conservatism and hence a lot of the problems growing out of control.The solution has to be to put water on the fires to slow them down, not more fuel as the liberals and socialists would do.<br /><br />  Can anyone in their right mind really believe that the left wing liberal thinking that has been applied since WWII to education,medical care,welfare,immigration,crime,justice and punishment,freedoms of religion,families and so forth ,has resulted in any success?<br /><br />  Buchanan may not be the most popular political writer around.He is certainly too direct to get elected;but he has been right more than he has been wrong;and that's what matters;at least to him.l.The solution has to be to put water on the fires to slow them down, not more fuel as the liberals and socialists would do. <br />  Can anyone in their right mind really believe that the left wing liberal thinking that has been applied since WWII to education,medical care,welfare,immigration,crime,justice and punishment,freedoms of religion,families and so forth ,has resulted in any success? <br />  Buchanan may not be the most popular political writer around.He is certainly too direct to get elected;but he has been right more than he has been wrong;and that's what matters;at least to him.	2005-04-09

I chose a line from page 225 for my title because I think it is about as profound a statement as you'll find in the book.The author credits Chambers with the statement;but I suggest it was said by others long before him.Whether you think it is a left or right wing statement;will obviously depend on your politics. Who do you think shrieks the loudest Fonda or Heston?<br /><br />  Ratings for this book are very different than most ratings;for the simple reason that political convictions have a major impact on what the reader takes from it.There is little doubt that liberals will hate it and conservatives will love it,just as would be the opposite with a book on politics written by Al Franken.Now,with that said,you will note that the book did not recieve an overall rating of 3* because it was an average book.Most readers rated it either 1* or 5* and obviously those who voted ,voted from a politically motivated viewpoint.It doesn't matter whether it got 1* or 5*'s rarely did any review get more than half for helpful.<br /><br />  I read a lot of the reviews and two stood out to me and I would recommend them.Those being by James Stephen Garrett on Nov 18,2004;a top 1000 Reviewer and John Ryan on Nov 11,2004;a top 50 Reviewer.Again,as good as these reviews are,they receive only approximately 50% helpful votes.Maybe the best thing with all the votes is to ignore the unhelpful ones.This reminds me of the old adage \\"we're from the government,and we're here to help you\\".<br /><br />  As a Canadian ,I find this book very different as we do not get this passionate a book about politics from either stripe.Then again, we never get passionate about much;maybe other than Hockey.With the NHL shut down,we don't even have that.The great Sponsorship Scandel (misuse of govt.funds)didn't even do it,the Liberals got re-elected.<br /><br />  Hey,what did we do to deserve this?We are still trying to recover from the Vietnam Draft Dodgers and now the liberals who can't stand Bush are threatning to invade us.<br /><br />  By the way, the Elephant and Donkey party symbols all decorated in red,white and blue, stars and stripes are great.The bald Eagle triumph over the Turkey is a great national symbol.Look what we got stuck with;a Beaver(water rodent) all he does is swim around in circles,and at the first sign of trouble,flaps his tail,dives and hides.Does he fit the liberal or conservative image?You decide.<br /><br />  So if you like politics and history ,you'll love ,or hate this book.Either way a great read!ade us. <br />  By the way, the Elephant and Donkey party symbols all decorated in red,white and blue, stars and stripes are great.The bald Eagle triumph over the Turkey is a great national symbol.Look what we got stuck with;a Beaver(water rodent) all he does is swim around in circles,and at the first sign of trouble,flaps his tail,dives and hides.Does he fit the liberal or conservative image?You decide. <br />  So if you like politics and history ,you'll love ,or hate this book.Either way a great read!	2005-04-06

As one reads this book,the reader should keep in mind that it was published in 1993- that's 13 years ago,and much of the thoughts and research probably took place sometime before that.It is a credit to Toffler's skill to read the book now and to see how dead on the mark he is.<br />  The big thing that comes out in this book is that the whole world has not gone through these three waves;in fact some countries have barely entered into the first wave.All countries must try to get along regardless which wave they are in.Also some countries are operating in the first wave in some things,others in the second wave and even in the third wave in others.This is summed up in what Toffler describes as \\"A World Trisected.\\"<br />  When war is involved ,it is a matter of life and death,and if one does not adapt they will end up on the scrapheap of history.<br />  This book opens ones eyes to so many things that are going on today.It is little wonder that the United Nations,which was formed during the second wave and continues to operate that way;that it has essentially been useless in dealing with terrorism around the world.One should also keep in mind that our governments and political systems along with our legal,criminal and justice systems were also developed for the second wave and continue to dwell there.<br />\\"You may not be interested in war,but war is interested in you.\\"<br />  -Trotsky	2005-03-31

This is an excellent read.The author put a lot of effort into this book.Although any person who reads much history will probably be somewhat familiar with most of the ships covered in this book,Hoehling has done a supurb job of covering 8 shipwreck stories.For instance, the Mary Celeste has been written about endlessly over the years and it is likely that there will be many more books,references and articles to come in the future.Hoehling gives us a good summary of the facts and legends with this ship,and a lot of good references for further reading He takes the same approach on all 8 shipwrecks.His writing style keeps the reader,s interest and does not get bogged down in quoting endlessly from inquiries or investigative commissions that always result from the loss of life and ships,particularly those hwere there are unanswered questions.After finishing this book,the reader has a fairly good idea about each shipwreck without plowing through 8 full length books.I quite well remember following the loss of the Scorpion at the time. The author very well sums it all up in only 16 pages.<br /><br />  The number of shipwrecks over the years must be huge in number and the total loss of lives unimagineable.It seems to me that a very large percentage of all ships that sailed the seas must have either sunk,were abandoned or otherwise wrecked,particularly sailing vessels.Although there were many warships lost at sea or sunk right in harbor,I suspect that a larger number ended up being decommissioned and salvaged,than was the case with passenger and other cargo ships.However; that is only a guess on my part.Another point that came to mind to me was the huge expansion in the size and complexity in ships in the short space of 50 or 60 years.In the late 1840,s we saw how perilous it was for the \\"coffin Ships\\" that transported the immigrants from Ireland,how unpredictable a successful crossing could be , how horrible on board conditions were and how awful food , hygine and medical was.Then ,lo and behold in the early 1900's we saw massive ,luxury liners like Lusitania and the Titanic.<br /><br />  This book was first published in 1984 and I believe very little was done to update it,particularlr the  references when re published in 1999.The only exception I noticed was some of the material at the end of the chapters on the Morro Castle and the Lusitania.So,one is naturally left with the impression that there is little here that has evolved in the past 20 years.<br /><br />  My title was from a Breton fisherman's prayer,quoted by the author;on a plaque that sat on President Kenneddy's desk given to him by Admiral Rickover.It was also incorporated in  a memorial plaque to the 34 men lost on the S.S.Poet.<br /><br />  Churchill's quote \\"a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\\" is most applicable when it comes to these mysterious shipwrecks.al was.Then ,lo and behold in the early 1900's we saw massive ,luxury liners like Lusitania and the Titanic. <br />  This book was first published in 1984 and I believe very little was done to update it,particularlr the  references when re published in 1999.The only exception I noticed was some of the material at the end of the chapters on the Morro Castle and the Lusitania.So,one is naturally left with the impression that there is little here that has evolved in the past 20 years. <br />  My title was from a Breton fisherman's prayer,quoted by the author;on a plaque that sat on President Kenneddy's desk given to him by Admiral Rickover.It was also incorporated in  a memorial plaque to the 34 men lost on the S.S.Poet. <br />  Churchill's quote \\"a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\\" is most applicable when it comes to these mysterious shipwrecks.  <br />	2005-03-27

Frum gives us as clear a view as possible of how President Bush thinks,what his values are,what he plans to do and how he goes about accomplishing his goals.Frum demonstrates over and over again, that the image portrayed by most of the media in North America as well as around the world could not be further from the truth.The media was so slanted against President Bush for the two years leading up to the 2004,that they even believed their own misrepresentations.They had no idea that they were so off base and that President Bush would be re-elected.They haven't got over it yet.Rather than understanding why they lost they still think the voters got it all wrong.<br />  Frum was there and tells what it was really like.You have only to read what he tells us;then ask yourself if that wasn't really what happened.The history and facts speak for themselves.Not everyone can write about this as Frum does;since few were there as he was.The media even got it all wrong,intentionally or not,why Frum left when he did.<br />  Frum shows how President Bush utilizes his staff,but in the final analysis he is in charge and makes the decisions;not Cheney,not Rumsfeld,not Wolfowitz,not the Polls,not the big Corporations,not Haliburton,not the Jews,not the Religious Right,not his Texas pals,not the CIA,not the military and on and on.This is what his detractors have spun for the people to believe,and the only ones they convince is themselves.<br />  Some of the words Frum uses to describe The President are:<br /><br />  \\"Steady,efficient,controlled\\"<br /><br />  \\"Moderation,persistance and boldness.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Bush was not a lightweight.He was,rather,a very unfamiliar type of heavyweight.Words often failed him,his memory sometimes failed him,but his vision was large and clear.And when he perceived new possibilities,he had the courage to act on them;a much less common virtue in politics than one might suppose.\\"<br /><br />  When asked,\\"Is it hard to make decisions as president?Not really.If you know what you believe,decisions come pretty easy.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Presidents are either in command of events or at their mercy.\\"It's easy to see how that applies to President Bush.<br /><br />  Though portrayed by his detractors as a reckless,redneck cowboy;\\"Bush's great gift to the country after 9/11 was his calm and self-restraint.\\"<br /><br />  Frum tells us where the expression \\"Axis of Evil\\" came from and why it was used.<br /><br />  Find out the real reason the US doesn't buy into the International Convention on land mines,the Koyoto Accords and the International Criminal Court<br /><br />  \\"Bush does not lie to you.You had better not lie to him.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Read George Bush's major speeches-and nothing else-and nothing he does will come as a surprise to you.Like Babe Ruth pointing to the stands before hitting a home run,Bush clearly indicates in advance exactly what he will do.\\"<br /><br />  Frum even tells us about a line that never made it into a speech as it was \\"too bellicose\\". \\"Those who choose America for an enemy choose their own destruction.\\";even though it amply describes how right-of center Americans felt.<br /><br />  On Sept 20,2001 ,President Bush stated,\\"Every nation,in every region,now has a decision to make.Either you are with us,or you are with the terrorists.From this day forward,any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded as a hostile regime.\\"<br /><br />  America pleaded for the freedom loving countries to join her in this War on Terror.Many abandoned her ,Canada included,tended to side with the european detractors.With an over abundance of left wingers and Socialists,it's no wonder  as they don't understand,\\"The tough get going when the going gets tough.\\"<br /><br />  The cover on the hard cover copy of this book is excellent. If nothing else ,it should prove to you that President Bush is the right man for  President in these times.Sure he has a whole array of people to write great lines and speeches ,lots of people to set up photo ops; but this shot was completely unorchestrated.A retired fireman beckoned his President to join him on the roof of a truck and to say something.When unable to be heard, President Bush spontaneously said \\"Well I can hear you.\\"<br />Then his face grew serious.\\"I can hear you.\\"The rest of the world hears you.<br />And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear from all of us soon.\\"<br /> I suspect this photo and statement will become the defining one of his terms as President.<br />  Frum also treated us to another great insight into working at the White House:<br /><br />  \\"Now it was time to heed Andy Card's admonition:to remember that a White House job was an honor,not a career.\\"That sure fits as a caption for the shot of the President on the back cover,as he takes a stroll on his ranch in Crawford,Texas.It sort of reminds one of the photos of President Truman taking a stroll in Independence Missouri after retiring from his excellent Presidency.<br />  A great book!ident to join him on the roof of a truck and to say something.When unable to be heard, President Bush spontaneously said \\"Well I can hear you.\\"  Then his face grew serious.\\"I can hear you.\\"The rest of the world hears you.

I had never seen nor heard of this book or its author when I picked it up.I must admit, it didn't do much for me,particularly in the first quarter of the book.Like another reviewer, it also hit me as disjointed and in need of a lot of editing.As a matter of fact, I nearly gave up on it.That would have been a big mistake.After finishing it,I still feel the book gets a lot better,from every respect,the further you get into it.<br /><br />  I have been to Ireland three times and find it an absolutely fascinating country.The people,history,landscape,music,literature<br /><br />and all, fail to amaze me.<br /><br />  Gannon is impressed with the Irish skill in the use of language as I am and he is a writer,and he should know.What the Irish can do with language does not come from a book,can't be taught in school;it comes from the soul--and as far as I can tell-it has to come from an Irish soul.<br /><br />  I was really taken by Gannon's concept of \\"thin places\\".He mentions several and made me think of some too: Sitting on the base of Molly Malone's statute talking to a couple of street people,Kennys Bookstore in Galway,A stroll up Fall's Road in Belfast,B&B at Trinity College,Blarney Castle,Grafton Street,Gogarty's in Temple Bar,Shop Street in Galway,Sitting in the Lord Mayor,s chair in Belfast,Joseph Plunkett's cell and the Chapel where he married Grace Gifford before being executed in Kilmainham Gaol in 1916,just to name  few.<br /><br />  You'll surely enjoy this book if you've ever been to or plan to visit Ireland.	2005-03-20

First of all,there are 17 other reviews;most of them excellent and all deserve to be read.I read a fair bit of modern Irish Writing.The McCourts,Roddy Doyle,Brendan Behan,Morgan Llywelyn,Brendan O'Carroll,just to name a few.What I really like about these writers is their magical use of language.Although I have been a fan of Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers for at least 30 years,I have never read anything about them.I had no idea of how much they were involved in acting;let alone that any of them had such gifted writing skills.What a surprise;Liam's skills are as good as his musical talents.<br /><br /> Though not a Clancy,I heard Tommy Makem perform here in Toronto at an intimate club a few months ago.He did \\"Oh, me name is Dick Darby,I'm a cobbler.\\";mentioned on page 102.That had to be the best recitation I ever witnessed.<br /><br />  I would like to quote something Liam wrote about his experience in North Carolina in 1956 and he was writing about it nearly 50 years after the fact.<br /><br />  From page 170....<br /><br />  \\"South Carolina in the spring was seductive with scents of growing things,of magnolias and hibiscus,the air heavy with noontime heat and the swampy buzz of katydids and flying critters.The nights there belonged to the frogs and bats and flying beetles and the countless mingled smells of a land at rest after a burgeoning day's work fermenting life.\\" Imagine the thoughts of a 21 year old,written 50 years later.<br /><br />  I also had no idea of Clancy's involvment with the people like Oscar Brand,Bob Dylan,Woody Guthrie,Pete Seeger,Odetta,Barbara Streisand,Lenny Bruce,Jean Ritchie,Ramblin' Jack Elliot,Brendan Behan,Diane (Guggenheim),Josh White,Alan Lomax,Mary O'Hara and on and on.<br /><br />  Liam gives a great insight into the world of acting and folk music of the 50's and the 60's. Now that I have read the book,I am looking forward to listening to the tape.<br /><br /> I also have no idea if Liam has a second book planned to cover the last 40 years.I am sure it would be a great follow up.How about it Liam,you're only 70 ,and you must still have lots to tell us.<br /><br />  Thanks.would be a great follow up.How about it Liam,you're only 70 ,and you must still have lots to tell us. <br />  Thanks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-18

There are already 462 Reviews on this book;so just about everything possible has already been said.I found the reviews very entertaining.Most feel the book is real good.It is up to date,present day type of humor.It reminds me of the early days of Mad Magazine who relentlessly attacked the establishment and was very inovative for its time.While there were some who did not like the book,it was also a fact that some did not like Mad.<br />There is a simple solution to that.Take the book from the shelf and read any ten pages.If you like it,then you'll love the book.If after ten pages,you fail to see the humor,put it back;what you got is what you'll get in the rest of the book.<br />  This book is a very good example of this type of humor and whether one likes it or not, depends on the reader,not the book.	2005-03-16

I have just finished reading this book and only a few days after completing \\"The Head of God\\"-The Lost Treasure of the Templars by Keith Laidler (see my review of March 9,2005).So, why read this book when I learned all the secrets already?I thought there might be a chance they both got it right.Well, who knows ;maybe they did,and maybe they didn't.However; what I was really looking for ,I found.I was trying to get a feel for the multitude of secret societies ,what their secrets were and why they kept their secrets.How ,and if, there was any connections to them .Are they basically religious,anti-religious or non-religious?What about occults,Satanism,Hedonism,Magic,,Worship of Icons,Alchemy,Mythology,Gnostics,Heresies,Pagans,Rosicrucians,New Age,and on and on?<br /><br />This book gives a pretty good overall view of a lot of these subjects particularly how they originated and how ,or even if, there were connections with the Templars and possibly with present day organizations such as the Freemasons.<br /><br />  There is a lot of material covered,and if the reader is still looking for more there are references throughout the book to other fairly recent books and each chapter is supplied with footnotes and references.On top of that there are several pages of a Selected Bibliography.Maybe the \\"the truth\\"is hidden somewhere amongst all that material;but it may be as elusive to find as the Holy Grail itself.<br /><br />  I guess as long as mankind has belief systems,this sort of thing will continue.While the assumptions and suppositions can't all be true;it's interesting to see how they developed.<br /><br />  You gotta admit though, Eric von Daniken,Berlitz,Lindsey and all didn't do too badly.Never mind simply finding the Holy Grail ;they get down to the real serious stuff like: \\"where did we all come from in the first place?\\"	2005-03-13

This is just a fun little book.What we have here is a  collection of 107 photos.There is nothing special about any of these pictures.A lot of them were actully posed for but a totally unconnected caption is added that makes the connection very humorous.A lot of the others are shots that are taken when the President is off guard,relaxed,or even clowning around.It is easy to get shots like this since the cameras are flashing continuously.It kind of reminds me of when I tried to get my 3 kids to pose for a group shot.It also shows how much expressions change even when they are aware that a camera is on them.So, to anyone who has lots of \\"discards\\",it is quite simple to spread some out and come up with some great comments to attach to them.One should not take offense at these photos or add any particular political bias over it all as it has been done about many prominent persons.Any world leader and particularly the Queen of England and the Pope are often subjects and of course all presidents at all times.<br />  I am sure President Bush would get a good laugh out of them,and could even come up with as good or better captions.<br />  An even better approach would be to take an actual comment made,then add it to a totally disconnected photo.It would even be fun to take the photos in this book,remove the captions and come up with your own.Hey,have I just invented a parlour game?<br />  This same thing has frequently been done with animals.One of my favorites is a head shot of a Bald Eagle with the caption \\"But I am smiling\\".<br />  For some time I have kept a collection of shots of celebrity faces ,with everything removed but the eyes.It's like a puzzle book where the object is to guess who the eyes belong to. Maybe it would be fun to make your own book of photos,either your own snapshots or photos from papers or magazines and come up with your own captions.Who says you could never write a book?<br />  Anyway, an entertaining little book that is good for a half hour's look through;but an idea that could be developed as a personal or group entertainment.dea that could be developed as a personal or group entertainment.	2005-03-10

I have read a bit about: Templars,Masons,Sinclairs,Illuminati,New World Order,secret societies,Holy Wars,Inquisition,Celtic legends and history,and on and on.<br /><br /> I thought this would give some real insight into the workings of these secret societies.Although I enjoyed the book,about all that I really concluded was that there is no end to all this stuff.What this book does is give a history of mainly Christianity,leaning on the disputes between the Church of Rome and The Templars.On that,it does a good job but even though the secret societies exist to today,the book doesn't really deal with much after the mid 14th Century at which time the author convinces himself that The Head of God was buried under a piller in Rosslyn Chapel,in Scotland by the Templars.<br /><br />  As far as reading the book,here's what I found.It was highly detailed , even to the point of boring to the extent that I almost packed it in.However,about half way thtough,at chapter 12 it changed and at that point it became a very good read.<br /><br /> Will we ever really know? I doubt it. If they excavate under the pillar and find the head,there are going to be a lot of disappointed people,if they don't find it ,there are going to also be a lot of disappointed people,all be it not the same ones.Then again, who is going to believe whose head is it anyway;presuming the word ever gets out as to what is found.<br /><br />  Now I'll let you in on a secret.I say a secret since Laidler doesn't mention it in his book.Mark Finnan in 1999 wrote a book titled \\"The Sinclair Saga\\" in which he describes Prince Henry Sinclair,Admiral of the Seas and Lord Chief Justice of Scotland's possible voyage to Nova Scotia and New England in 1397.He builds a good case for the Holy Grail being hid on this side of the Atlantic.<br /><br />  So,there you go,it's a good read too!	2005-03-09

This is just the kind of book I've been looking for on the American Presidents.I do a lot of reading about American Politics and History and end up chasing through books looking for information about the President at the time .Sometimes I find what I am looking for but not always.The people who put this book together have done a superlative job of creating a reference book that covers all the same things about each of the Presidents.It doesn't take long to get to know what you can expect to find.Important dates,family members,famous statements,major events during their terms ,pictures,campaigns,Inaugural Addresses,election statistics,running mates,opponents,and so forth.I must stress,they didn't just include what they had on hand to fill the space;they dug up all the same things for each President.When you want to know something,you won't be wondering if it will be there;you'll be confident you'll find it.<br />  Another thing I found quite interesting was that each President's signature was included with their picture.Also.the first picture was of the time when in office.I happen to have a book signed by President Truman,while in office.It was fun to compare it with the one in this book.It is also interesting to compare the various signatures.For,instance,who had the best penmanship?In my opinion,James Buchanan wins hands down.I particularly admire Andrew Johnson's and Andrew Jackson's,which were quite similar. For the most intricate,that has to go to James Polk.<br />  What a great cast of characters ,have come forward to lead America;and no two even remotely alike.<br />  A wonderful reference source,and I know I'll turn to it often.	2005-03-07

One might be tempted to pass this book up for a couple of reasons.First it was published in 2001,so it must be out of date.Second,with a title like this it must be some Redneck book;and a waste of time for astute political junkies,regardless of stripe,to be bothered with.If you feel that way,you're going to miss one of the best chances you will get to find out where GW came from,and what chances he thought he had in winning against Gore.This book is written from the inside view of those who put together Bush's campaign as well as the character of  the man who totally surprised the pundits by winning over Gore, who was believed to have the election all wrapped up.It will also show you that Bush's opponents still believe in their own biasas over reality ,and lost again in 2004.<br /><br />  In the book it is clear that Bush's team put things together and it was a guiding principle not to use polls to make policy.We have seen this principle adheared to through his first term and continuing into his second term.Voters  respect a President that knows where he wants to go,is open about his intentions,stays the course in spite of continual sniping from opponents,and does what is right and lets the losers play the poll game.The presidents in the past who followed that principle have won the support of electors of both parties.Just a brief aside from the book;look at what is going on in the media today,filled with polls showing how great things are for the Democrats and how nobody agrees with Bush.It seems that they still haven't figured it out that it is not debates and polls that win, but trust and who the voters believe who will best lead the nation,uphold the laws and lend respect to the office of The President of the United States.<br /><br />  Another thing that comes through in this book is the respect Bush's team had for Gore,s organization but they decided to give it a fair fight.The one thing that you don't see is a deep hatred the left wing has for Bush mirrored to their opponents.<br /><br />  In the last election,it was clear that Bush certainly didn't win the debates,but then again,the people were voting for a President ,not a debate winner.<br /><br />  I Strongly recommend this book for a good insight into Bush and you'll see he has remained true to his principles.Even if you have disagreements with him,you know his intentions and where he stands.Most of all,he will give the job his best and the office the respect it deserves.If other people  and countries have a problem with that;so be it!I just wish my country would see what a great friend the US has been instead of looking to the UN and EU all the time.The chant we get here from the left-wing liberals and socialists is \\"Oh,we like America,It's just Bush we hate.\\"Most of them are so deluded they even believe it.their opponents. <br />  In the last election,it was clear that Bush certainly didn't win the debates,but then again,the people were voting for a President ,not a debate winner. <br />  I Strongly recommend this book for a good insight into Bush and you'll see he has remained true to his principles.Even if you have disagreements with him,you know his intentions and where he stands.Most of all,he will give the job his best and the office the respect it deserves.If other people  and countries have a problem with that;so be it!I just wish my country would see what a great friend the US has been instead of looking to the UN and EU all the time.The chant we get here from the left-wing liberals and socialists is \\"Oh,we like America,It's just Bush we hate.\\"Most of them are so deluded they even believe it.	2005-03-06

When I bought this book, I thought I might get some real concrete facts in the debate of evolution.I must admit,I was disappointed.<br /><br />The problem is that Biology is not a Science like Mathematics or Physics where theories are subjected to the Scientific Method and a truth or law is proven;and once done does not change based on the pressure of factions or schools of thought.So, if you accept the stuff in this book as science;let me quote Lavers:(page 56)<br /><br />  \\"McNab's theory involves a few assumptions,but it is ingenious and at least consistent with the broad pattern of body-size variation known from the fossil record.It has received surprisingly little attention from scientists,however,partly because it is rather complicated but mostly because one year later,in 1979,a radical different theory was proposed that caught the imagination of most researchers in the field and seemed to offer a more general explanation for the evolution of warm-bloodedness in both mammals and birds.\\"Since when is science based on how much attention ,how complicated or how much imagination a theory catches?<br /><br />  Then again,on page 101:<br /><br />\\"The total number of species also declines towards the poles.The reasons for this are complex and not yet fully understood-at least twenty-eight theories have been proposed-but some factors are clear.\\"Take your pick,get a few to go along with you,now you have a school of thought.But don't wait too long,there'll be some more theories shortly.<br /><br />  This is more like Archaeology where things are collected,measued,named,classified,catalogued,and so forth,but if one expects to get the origin resolved;that will depend on the school of thought in vogue at the time.At least they don't try to pass it off as science.	2005-03-05

Hunter and even found Sam Loyd's \\"Cyclopedia of Puzzles\\" way back in the late 50's; I have always enjoyed a Jigsaw;more as a light time filler than something serious.That was until recent years as I came across more and more jigsaws with a twist or greater challenge.When I found one like an M.C Escher 1000 piece House of Stairs,I realized there was more to jigsaws than a 500 piece sailing ship or farm scene.That's not to say I don't enjoy a Wysocki just to relax and work with my wife.She can't stand the \\"weird ones'.As I started to pay more attention I found photomosaics,one-color,double-sided,maze-jigsaws,mystery puzzles,puzzles such a field of clover,Rubic Cubes,and last but not least those devilish 3-D computer images with a ghostly lion or other hidden image.<br /><br />  Then I came across this book in a used book store and found out what an interesting subject jigsaws really were.This book covered just about everything you could imagine and as far as I knew it was the only book like it There couldn't be too many other such books because I have over 500 books on puzzles and hadn't seen any others.<br /><br /> This is a very good book and would be a joy for any puzzle collector.<br /><br />  That being said ,I just came across \\"The Jigsaw Puzzzle\\" by Anne Williams.(see my review for that one)	2005-03-01

Just when I least expected it, a new book on Jigsaw Puzzles appears.I already had a good book on the subject,\\"The One,The Only,The Original Jigsaw Puzzle Book\\" by Francene and Louis Sabin,1977.It was and still is a very good book.While obviously,some of the same things are covered,there is still enough that ie different to make it worthwhile as a companion to this new jigsaw book.(see my review ).In just about every aspect, this book gives a lot more.There are 16 color pages showing about 50 collectible jigsaws;no way could black and white do them justice.History of jigsaws is covered from their inception in the mid-1700's and particulaly during the puzzle crazes of the 1920's.Also covered is how inovations took place over the years .There are details on construction and manufacture as well as complete instructions on various ways to make your own puzzles.We are also told of some of the famous people who indulge in puzzles;Bill Gates,Albert Einstein,Bing Crosby,Jean Harlow,George W. Bush,Stephen King,several US Presidents and even J.P.Morgan.Hard to believe all these people have something in common.We are also told of speed competitions to assemble puzzles as well as record size and complexity of puzzles.<br /> I also found out about a puzzle I've had for some time and never got around to working on. Namely, one put out by Christopher Mockton,in 1998 called Eternity.He was the son of a Vicount and advisor to Prime Minister Thatcher.The puzzle consisted of 209 geometrically shaped pieces which had to be placed in a frame.Somewhat like a 209 piece Tangram.The buyer had 4 years to complete it for a Million Pound prize.To great astonishment, 2 Cambridge students spent 6 months on a computer program and successfully solved it.Mockton had to sell his ancestral home in Scotland to pay off the prize.It is a great collector's item,and I found in a 'Thrift Store'for a dollar,but somehow I doubt I'll ever solve it.<br />  It kind of reminds me of Loyd's \\"Cyclopedia of Puzzles\\"This huge volume was hastily assembled by his son and privately published in 1914 and offered a large prize to the first person who submitted correct solutions to all the puzzles.Well,there were all kinds of errors,multiple solutions,impossible solutions and whatnot ,so that nobody won the prize.Dover Publishing and Martin Gardner put out a selection of these puzzles in 1959.<br />  Sorry for the digression.The Jigsaw book gives us some names for various shaped pieces,such as, ,turtles,loops,sockets,knobs,holes,tabs,slots,keys,  locks and suggests you find some of your own names.I like tongues,mouths,lefties,righties,uppers,downers,straights,curves, to name a few more.<br />  Then to top it off, Williams gives hundreds of references,all the way from web sites,books,manufacturers,sellers,organizations and many,many references to articles in all sorts of publications.<br />  It's hard to imagine this being anything but the definitive book on Jigsaw Puzzles for a long time.Then again;maybe another new dog will appear on the block;but it'll have to be good to top this one.uge volume was hastily assembled by his son and privately published in 1914 and offered a large prize to the first person who submitted correct solutions to all the puzzles.Well,there were all kinds of errors,multiple solutions,impossible solutions and whatnot ,so that nobody won the prize.Dover Publishing and Martin Gardner put out a selection of these puzzles in 1959.

When it comes to Westerns this one is excellent.Johnstone has that special knack of being able to tell it like it is, at the same time as being able to tell it like it was.Once you get into the story,and that takes only about 2 pages, it is hard to put down.I don't know what it is,but Johnstone breaks up this story of 240 pages unto 32 chapters.That approach results in him having to keep something new coming and the story moving right along.Hey,he isn't the first to use this approach,after all,wasn't the Bible written this way?If you want an example to follow,it's not a bad choice.The copy I have is a Collector,s Edition and included a 6 page Afterword by the author.I enjoyed it immensely and he tells us a bit about himself and why and how he got into writing Westerns.Along with great stories,Westerns usually have some excellent artwork on their covers;this one is super.It would be good if a little about the artist was included.<br /><br />  I once read that all novels really fall into two types:<br /><br />  A-- A man went on a journey<br /><br />  and<br /><br />  B-- A stranger came to town<br /><br /> This one seems to fit both bills;but is really type B.<br /><br />  As I read this story I was reminded of the verse:<br /><br />  \\"Yeah,though I walk through<br /><br />  the Valley of Death<br /><br />  I fear no Evil<br /><br />  'cause I,m the meanest<br /><br />  S.O.B.<br /><br />  in the valley!<br /><br />  It didn't take Colonel Trainor,Gilmar,Bullard and their gunhawks long to find that out, when they decided to mess with Frank Morgan.<br /><br />  A couple of good lines Johnstone gives us are:<br /><br />  \\"Stand still and listen and live or grab iron and die,Morgan,\\"the voice said,\\"It,s your choice.\\"How little he realized what was in store for him.<br /><br />  \\"Think about death,boy,\\" Frank told him.\\"Give it some hard thought.Dead is forever,boy.Do you realize that?\\"<br /><br />  While some novels seem to need steamy encounters,Johnstone can say it all with:<br /><br />  \\"Frank grabbed her and pulled her down on the sofa.One thing led to another...\\"<br /><br />  \\"Frank once read about some fellow way back centries ago who was asked if he was afraid of something that faced him.No,the man said.He wasn't afraid of anything in the future,only what was behind him.\\"<br /><br />  Frank knew that would be true as he continued his journey out of the valley.<br /><br />  If you want to read a good Western,you'll not go wrong with this one.on the sofa.One thing led to another...\\" <br />  \\"Frank once read about some fellow way back centries ago who was asked if he was afraid of something that faced him.No,the man said.He wasn't afraid of anything in the future,only what was behind him.\\" <br />  Frank knew that would be true as he continued his journey out of the valley. <br />  If you want to read a good Western,you'll not go wrong with this one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br />   <br /> <br />	2005-02-27

Another wonderful work by Al Seckel and an appropriate companion to his other gem \\"Master's of Detection\\".See my review of it dated Dec 1,2004.<br /><br />  This is a fine collection of 144 intriguing illusions.There are examples of a lot of different forms of illusions.I say a lot because there is one form which I like which is not included. That being \\"trompe-l'oeil\\" which is French for still-life deception,illusion,sham or camouflage.A well known artist who excels at it is Bev Doolittle.<br /><br />  Al has included many of the classic illusions,of which 105 is an example from the puzzle master Sam Loyd,and crops up in many books.No.5 is really good being a combination of a photograph of a man holding an \\"impossible figure\\".Nos.10 & 104 are similar,but 10 jumps out at me while 104 is something else!No.26 and 139 would have to be called \\"real illusions\\".No.139 reminds me of an experience I had on the Marsh Boardwalk at Point Pelee National Park during spring bird migration.An American Bittern,which stands about 20 inches tall, was standing in the reeds about 30 feet from me in a similar pose;except the bill was pointed straight up.The bird held itself completely motionless while I pointed it out to quite a few people over a period of a half hour or so.Some had great dificulty in picking it out,even with binoculars.What a thrill it was for them when they finally \\"found it\\".<br /><br />  A few are ageless ones namely,14(which reminds me of another of a girl in a mirror),77,95,147 and 144 ;but always good to see again.No. 119 is a switch where you get to make and solve your own illusion or puzzle.<br /><br />  Kudos to Jerry,see review of Oct 23,2000,who states:<br /><br />  \\"The mind is blind to what the eye can't see\\".Well said!<br /><br />  Anyway, a great treatment of illusions and sure to catch the interest of young and not so young,and all in between.<br /><br />'	2005-02-26

Another great yarn.After all the episodes, No.236 is still a great story.Well written with lots of good old fashioned action.The outcome in this story is never in doubt;but how it all plays out keeps the reader's interest right up to the end.Skye gets thrown off a 300 foot cliff and survived.Anyone who reads this series would not be surprised;read it and find out how he managed to do that.Larry Gatlin sings that \\"All The Gold In California is in a bank in Beverly Hills \\" but in 1859 there was lots of it floating around Colorado Territory,some in the river in Nugget,some in the scammer Austin's safe,some in shotgun shells,and everyone wanting to get their hands on it and get rich.What I enjoy about these novels is it gives one a feel of the Wild West only 150 years ago.All greatly exaggerated,I know,but to me a lot more fun than the Sitcoms we get today.\\"Dead Man's Gun\\" the series produced by Henry Winkler (I think it was Fonzie he played on Happy Days)  and narrated by Kris Krisstofferson was super.It's been re-run a couple of times recently;and will surely be around again.Keep an eye out for it.<br />It was really good and much like one of The Trailsman series.<br /><br /> Note: the Editorial review shown with this book has nothing to do with Episode No.236,must have been a mix-up.	2005-02-24

Stein writes about those things that have been bothering so many people, with an ounce of common sense,for a long time.Sure, there were a  lot of things that were not perfect in the 60's and a lot of things were done by many people to correct them.Stein shows that while most good people fall into the middle of the political spectrum,there has and always will be extremists both on the left and right wing of politics.<br />  He covers all aspects of social changes,agendas,and other issues and really leaves it up to the reader to decide for himself,as he did,what is really right and what is misguided.As to whether the way things have evolved was by design or by faulty idealism ;really doesn't matter.In the final analysis, right is right and wrong is wrong.<br />  Have we really seen progress in any of the areas discussed?<br />  There is litle doubt that far left wing dominance has ruled in education,media,and the arts in general;ever since the 60's;both under Democratic and Republicans.So,if you feel that the education institutions have lost their direction,the media is slanted and much of the arts represented by TV,Movies,Music and Graphics is pathetic;where does the fault lie?Because the institutions were turned over to the screaming inmates,is it any wonder that chaos was the result?To be fair it wasn't all the inmates only those who were screaming.<br />  So many of the agendas have been spearheaded or hyjacked by people who were  full of hatred against anyone who had an opinion that differed in any way from theirs.In all their actions we see , not a desire to build hope and promise but unbridled desire to tear down and destruct.If anything is successful,to them, it must be done away with.The morals and belief systems that were the foundations of the country that led to the liberty and freedoms seem to be most objectionable to them.<br />  Stein sums it up on page 136 with:<br />  \\"I,for one,can respect serious souls who continue to believe that liberalism remains the road to an honorable and humane future.But a lot of contemporary liberal dogma is not so much forward-looking as based on compempt for the past,including what many of us see as our best traditions and most essential values;we are thus deeply affronted by the characterization of both the way things are and how they used to be.<br />  True,both sides are marked by their fair share of intellectual corruption and many on each side have made an art of turning truth on its head.<br />  But it strikes me that the question that needs to be asked and asked and asked again-not glossed over,but seriously thought about-is one which would never occur to most who see themselves as progressive:Which side is more intolerant? Or,perhaps more accurately,which side's brand of intolerance has done more damage lately?<br />  For it is not as if committed cultural liberals refuse to pass judgement.They're endlessly on the lookout for racism,sexism,homophobia,kookism,ageism,classism,ethnocentrism,you name it,and perceived transgressors can expect no mercy.The only excesses they won't condemn are sexual ones.They're for every kind of diversity going-except diversity of thought.\\"<br />  Stein could well have inclued Canada in his observations except for one difference.Here we have a void of conservative thinking;we just drift in the netherland between liberalism and<br />socialism.Oh yeah,I forgot seperatism,whatever that is.If you think that your liberals are full of themselves,try ours;they think they could run the USA better than either the Democrats or the Republicans.<br />  Keep the faith and God Bless America.able and humane future.But a lot of contemporary liberal dogma is not so much forward-looking as based on compempt for the past,including what many of us see as our best traditions and most essential values;we are thus deeply affronted by the characterization of both the way things are and how they used to be.

I've always enjoyed 'Road Books' and this has got to be one of the best.Of course we all are familiar with the song \\"Get your kicks on Route 66\\" as well as the TV Series;which was a long time ago and to me is lost in the fog of the past.I've always had it in the back of my mind to \\"do\\" Route 66,all the way from Chicago to the coast,so when I saw this book,I just had to pick it up and read it.It is an extremely good read,with a large number of great photos.I don't think it is possible to do a book like this without including all the pictures.The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words certainly applied here.Until I read this book I had no idea of the lore and interest that so many people have about this road.I get the feeling there is nothing short of many thousands who make it a hobby in itself.Just for fun, I did a search on Amazon for Route 66,without specifying an author, and it turned up 193 items--wow!Every type of book imaginable,postcards,cook books,guides,maps;you name it,and its there to be had.<br />  I guess this book must be one of the best since it was listed first.<br /> My only experience with Route 66 was about 20 years ago when I visited Meramec Caverns in Stanton,Mo.While the book is excellent,I fear the trip,if taken now,would be somewhat disappointing,as it appears that so much has fallen victim to the ongoing march of \\"progress\\".However,I am sure there is still lots to explore and experience;particularly if one studies up on it and takes time to dig out the relics of the past.Then again,anytime one gets off the Interstates and takes time to observe while travelling the \\"back roads\\"there is lots to find and great people to talk to.Route 66 should still be no different.	2005-02-18

No doubt about it,this is a great joke book.I have about 25 similar collection of jokes and this is as good as any of them .Why do I say this? Well, first of all, this book has over 300 pages and each page has an average of at least 20 jokes;therefore we get at least 6000 jokes.Sure, some are so old they have wiskers,others are reworked chestnuts;but, by and large the vast majority were new to me.I've read a lot of Oscar Wilde and Mark Twain,so most of those from them were familiar,and even though forgotten,were enjoyable to read again.Then there were a lot of jokes from writers,politicans,humorists,and so forth who were new to me and I really enjoyed them.<br /><br />  One thing quite different with this book is that having been published by Penguin,it has many British jokes.<br /><br />  Another thing I liked was that the jokes are short,many are really one-liners.<br /><br /> One of my favorite kinds of jokes is the &#34;insult joke&#34;, of which I have been making a collection.Even here ,there were a few new to me;an example of a common one is:<br /><br />  He's not playing with a full deck.<br /><br />  This book gives me a few new ones--<br /><br />  His aerial doesn't pick up all the channels.<br /><br />  He's all booster and no payload.<br /><br />  He's a few fries short of a Happy Meal.<br /><br />  He doesn't have all his dogs on the same leash.<br /><br />  He's all foam and no beer.<br /><br />  I'm afraid her receiver's off the hook.<br /><br />  He's got an IQ that's about room temperature.<br /><br />  Now here's a good one to use when someone is going on about how important somebody is.&#34;They say at the office he does the<br /><br />  work of two men:Laurel and Hardy.&#34;<br /><br />  That's just a sample of what you get.<br /><br />  I agree with the reviewer ahead of me when he disagreed with those who rated this book as not very good.This book has jokes from some of the best of the 20th Century,what are they looking for?<br /><br />  I suggest they read the Foreward where the will see;<br /><br />  &#34;As part of our continuing commitment to quality,if you are in any way dissatisfied with your purchase of &#34;The Penguin Dictionary of Jokes&#34; please remember that our customer care department is there to help.They will remind you that not everyone has a fully developed sense of humour and therefore the fault may lie with you rather than with the book.&#34;<br /><br /> A great joke book;and I hope you enjoy it as much as I dd.enguin Dictionary of Jokes&#34; please remember that our customer care department is there to help.They will remind you that not everyone has a fully developed sense of humour and therefore the fault may lie with you rather than with the book.&#34;   A great joke book;and I hope you enjoy it as much as I dd.	2005-02-18

This book was a lot better than I thought it would be when I picked it up.I expected it was just going to be a collection of old hoaxes,many of which I was probably somewhat aware of anyway.Such was not the case.This book is an overview of the whole world of hoaxes.First, there are all kinds of dodges,fakes,frauds,flimfam,humbug,imposture,jeu d'esprit,practical jokes,pranks,shams,and on and on.Boese explains all of them and this book collects them all under the umbrella of hoaxes.He starts the book off with a Gullibility Test and the reader is quickly convinced the world is full of this stuff and that we have heard  a lot of it for so long that we assume it must be true.Boese tries to explain why people are so prone to believe hoaxes and does a pretty fair job of it.He follows the development of hoaxes from the Middle Ages to the present time.He shows how hoaxes have progressed along with the advance of all forms of communication ;from the early days of storytelling,books,photography,radio,TV,and now the World Wide Web.Maybe the one thing he may have missed is that one time when a hoaxer was tarred and feathered but now he gets off with a tap on the wrist;this must surly contribute the great explosion in hoaxes.He gives a good selection of hoaxes from over the years and of the various types of hoaxes.<br />  For someone who really enjoys digging into hoaxes they'll find included a list of 111 books and other references,that will be a wonderful resource.<br />  Along with all this, he tries to show us how we can look at an issue,and try to determine if a hoax is involved.He gave it a good try, but I'm not sure even he believes that there is any perfect defense against a well thought out and perpeturated hoax.<br />  After reading this book the reader is bound to look at event with a totally different viewpoint.Maybe we will suspect when the masses swallow the hook,line and sinker.The reward will be in \\"I felt there was something wrong about that!\\"<br />  If that wasn't enough ;Boese gives his Museum of Hoaxes Web site. I went to it, and it is terrific. This book is just an introduction to it.oese gives his Museum of Hoaxes Web site. I went to it, and it is terrific.

Another excellent 'prediction book'.Well written and a good summary of the worst storms of the 1990's.These global warming experts are speculating a future of doom and gloom while trying to dress it up in a cloak of science.How else could they get the funding for their causes,studies,1500 person conferences,and so forth?All this to study something that is obvious.You've got to admit it though,they've created quite an industry for themselves.<br /><br />  There have always been earthquakes,pandemics,violent storms,droughts,wars,etc.,and there will be more in the future.One doesn't need to be a genius to figure that out.It would be a stroke of genius if someone were to scientifically predict the future,but so far that has been the great illusion.<br /><br />  However,reading these books has an entertainment value.Check out my reviews of \\"5/5/2000 ICE-The Ultimate Disaster,11 Jan 2005\\" and \\"The Future in Plain Sight\\" 9 Jan 2004.Then again,we all remember predictions for Y2K.<br /><br />  This book was published in 2001 while the terrorists were planning 9/11.Where was their prediction of that?Also,we just experienced the terrible tsunami in the Indian Ocean,--oops missed that one too.All right,let's be fair,that wasn't the game then.But haven't we seen some attempts to tie the tsunami into global warming?Good area for more studies and research and conferences!It was interesting seeing on page 237:<br /><br />  \\"The continued decline in water levels in the Nile could threaten political stability...the next was in the Middle East,according to Egyptian officials,may very well be over water.\\" All the while,terrorism was running rampant now we have war in the Middle East,but not over water--again,not their game.<br /><br />  There is an adage that applies to this sort of thinking..<br /><br />  \\"If you take the generally accepted wisdom at the time,and<br /><br />  then take the totally opposite ,you'll probably<br /><br />  get closer to the truth.\\"<br /><br />  The only thing that can be predicted for the future  with<br /><br />certainty is that the future will be unpredictible.Calling spectulation and prediction science doesn't change anything.<br /><br />  Once predictions get complicated and pushed off into the future,all bets are off.<br /><br />  Don't get me wrong,we all learned in school that some things<br /><br />weer predictible;for instance:<br /><br />  \\"Pick on someone bigger than you-you're gonna get whupped.\\"<br /><br /> Now that's cause and effect in its basic form.<br /><br /> It wasn't many years ago that the pundits were running around telling us about the population explosion and we'd all be running out of food.Now we hear that 70 percent are overweight and we just the opposite crisis on our hands.Isn' that what the adage was all about?<br /><br />  Nonetheless the book is worth reading.e future  with  <br />certainty is that the future will be unpredictible.Calling spectulation and prediction science doesn't change anything. <br />  Once predictions get complicated and pushed off into the future,all bets are off. <br />  Don't get me wrong,we all learned in school that some things  <br />weer predictible;for instance: <br />  \\"Pick on someone bigger than you-you're gonna get whupped.\\" <br /> Now that's cause and effect in its basic form.  <br /> It wasn't many years ago that the pundits were running around telling us about the population explosion and we'd all be running out of food.Now we hear that 70 percent are overweight and we just the opposite crisis on our hands.Isn' that what the adage was all about?  <br />  Nonetheless the book is worth reading.	2005-02-09

I have been birding for 18 years and own several hundred bird books.I have used all the common books for North America that have been around during that period .I have built my life list for North America up to 596 species in that time.In my opinion, this is the best all round Field Guide for North America.<br /><br />Until this book first came out in 1983 the most popular bird guide was Peterson,s; but it came in two volumes,one for the East and one for the West.This book covers all North America.I am frequently asked by people who are just getting started in birding,people who are buying for someone they know who  \\"is interested\\" in birds and others who have a book ;but want something else;and ask,  \\"What is the best book to buy,there seem to be so many?\\" My answer is;\\"You can't go wrong with this book.\\"It is now in its 4th Edition, and I have bought each new edition as they have come out.There have been continual improvements made with each edition.The National Geographic have been a major publisher of all kinds of books for a long time. Personally,I feel their strength has been in photography and high quality printing and construction.In many cases their books are somewhat superficial;but don't let that disuade you .This book is so well done it is the choice of the majority of birders.I can't think of any birder I know who hasn't got a copy of it.<br /><br /> The thing that makes this book such a success is that it was put together by a large number of the best birders in North America.There are several other reviews on this book and they are all worth reading.I just can't imagine anyone regretting that they choose to buy this book;what more is there to say to recommend it?	2005-02-07

This book is an excellent documentation of the events that were carried out by terrorists culminating in the 9/11 Attack on America.<br /><br />  Details are given of all the efforts made by America to encourage the UN and all the major countries to take action to put an end to terrorism.<br /><br />  It's clear, by reviewing events,almost on a daily basis,that if terrorism was to be defeated,America would get little support or action from the UN or Europe.It shows that it was not America's decision to \\"go it alone\\",as so ofen portrayed by the media and many anti-American countries.In fact, America was not only \\"stiffed\\" ,but continually criticized for every effort made to end terrorism.Most of Europe conducted a \\"War over Iraq\\" while America conducted \\"war on Terrorism\\".<br /><br />  The book covers events up to the middle of 2003. Since that time there has been little if anything done by most of these countries that should have joined in fighting terrorism.The fact is that they have turned up their diatribe against America to cancel free elections in Iraq,because they couldn't be carried out.The fact that they were successful on Jan 31,2005,seems to be a great disappointment to the naysayers,and certainly not something to be jubilant about.Since the election,they have been continuing their prediction of doom and gloom.<br /><br />  If you really want to see what America's true intentions are, this book is the place to find the statements actually made, rather than listening to the commentaries made by so many in the media.<br /><br /> If you have bought into the nonsense that America is the villain and brought the War on Terror on itself,you could do yourself a favor and read this book and get the facts.<br /><br />  On 9/11 President Bush said:<br /><br />  \\"Terror against our nation wiil not stand\\"<br /><br />  As to my title---<br /><br />  \\"The global war on terror began in Afghanistan,to be sure,but it will not end there.It will not end until terrorist networks have been routed out from wherever they exist and it will not end until state sponsors of terror are made to understand that abetting terrorism is unacceptable,and will have deadly consequences for regimes that do.\\" This statement by Defence Secretary Rumsfeld on June 9, 2000 pretty well details America's intent to win the War on Terror.<br /><br />  There are also several other statements made about Iran,Syria,North Korea,etc.,that should be understood when thinking what America intends to do about terrorism.<br /><br />  Well worth reading and and keeping for a reference.wherever they exist and it will not end until state sponsors of terror are made to understand that abetting terrorism is unacceptable,and will have deadly consequences for regimes that do.\\" This statement by Defence Secretary Rumsfeld on June 9, 2000 pretty well details America's intent to win the War on Terror. <br />  There are also several other statements made about Iran,Syria,North Korea,etc.,that should be understood when thinking what America intends to do about terrorism. <br />  Well worth reading and and keeping for a reference.  <br />    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-07

This book was published in 1995,and reprinted in 1996,1998,2000 and 2001.So there seems to be a demand for this book and thus somewhat of a surprise to me that to date there have been no Customer Reviews posted here at Amazon.This could be for a couple of reasons.Possibly the amount of people who enjoy 'books about books'may be much smaller than one would imagine.I know for sure ,I seldom see any at book sales,book fairs,or in fact,at any second use market.It just came to mind,that I don't recall any mention of this type of book made in this book except for a few books about collecting in the back of the book under the heading, General Introduction.Another reason may be that this book is very heavily slanted to British books,only a slight bit about collecting books in America,and almost nothing about the rest of the world.The book has very little to say about the great enjoyment of the large number of people of modest means who enjoy collecting books or the thrills of finding a book one has been searching for and finding it when and where least expected. I read a lot,own about 6000 books and love bookstores,and any kind of book sale,but must admit I am not a collector as portrayed in this book.I guess that's okay as<br /><br />i am sure there are astute collectors who have bought expensive \\"collectible' gems who haven't or don't intend to read them.All that said, I did enjoy the book for the information it gave on the methods and technical details involved over the years pretaining to printing ,binding, illustrating and overall manufacture of books.<br /><br />  Fortunately,the rarity,cost and lack of  accessibility of many of the books mentioned and illustrated in this book does not put them out of reach as they are available at low cost in different editions.<br /><br />  There is a Glossary at the back of the book,but there are much more detailed ones elsewhere.<br /><br />  The book is well constructed,on quality paper and nice to spend a couple of hours glancing through ;but hardly a reference that will be consulted very often.<br /><br />  My title came from page 117 and I think it says as much about collecting books as the fact that there is some very rare ,very high priced copy of the same book locked away in some secluded cabinet or vault.When it comes to collecting the adage \\"To each his own\\" applies,Thank God.g through ;but hardly a reference that will be consulted very often.<br /><br />  My title came from page 117 and I think it says as much about collecting books as the fact that there is some very rare ,very high priced copy of the same book locked away in some secluded cabinet or vault.When it comes to collecting the adage \\"To each his own\\" applies,Thank God.	2005-02-01

Although this book was written for a younger audience,it is an excellent way to write history for a wide spectrum of readers.One reviewer suggests it might be a good version of the story of this important leader in Ireland and an incitement to read an extended version ; maybe so.So much history is written in a dry and difficult manner that many people get bored and turned off.History occured with passion and excitement and there is no reason that it should not be written the same way.Maybe history writers should take a lesson from Llywelyn.Llywelyn breathes life in this exciting story.I have two other books by this author,\\"1921\\" and \\"1949\\" that I am anxious to get into,and I'm a person who couldn't stand history as taught in school.This approach to writing history reminds me of Margaret Mitchell's \\"Gone With the Wind\\",John Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" and Cecil Woodham-Smith's \\"The Great Hunger\\".Did any history books ever cover The Civil War,The Great Depression or The Irish Famine with as much passion?

I picked this book up on a whim.What a pleasant and enjoyable surprise.While the real old west took place after the Civil War, around 1865, and was pretty well all over by 1890,in reality a short period of 25 years.What we have here is the the west of the real world and the west of movies,music, rodeos,and the whole western scene. That started in the early 1900's and is still going strong;over 100 years and still counting.The book is chock full of trivia and brings back to me the Saturday matinees, sitting in the local movie theatres, watching our heros, who always prevailed over the rustlers,land grabbers,railroad barons,Indians and last but not least the crooked lawman or the bank robbers.<br />  The book is filled with hundreds of down home recipes that are simple and mouth watering.Many are very similar to ones we already are familiar with, but with enough differences to give them a western flavor.<br />  While loaded with pictures of just about everyone you can remember,and some you don't, there is lots of cowboy wisdom as well--<br /><br />  \\"You see, in this world ,there are two kinds of people,<br />  my friend-those with loaded guns and those who dig.You dig.\\"<br /><br />  \\"A gun is a tool,Marion.No better,no worse than any other<br />  tool-an ax,a shovel,or anything.A gun is as good or as bad<br />  as the man using it.Remember that.\\"<br /><br />  And then there was Roy Roger's horse Trigger.Do you know<br />  who he bought it from and for how much?The answer to that bit of trivia is 'in the book'.	2005-01-30

Another real good book about Sinatra.Frank entertained us, and himself, for so many years and his music,movies and life continue to entertain us.This book is a unique look at what was possibly the most interesting 15 years of his 'reign\\" as the \\"Chairman of the Board\\".The whole persona of Sinatra  was not manufactured by some studio group or whatever-it was created by Frank himself.That is why nobody sang a song,played a role,wore a hat,loved a woman,had a friend, treated a fan,or dealt with someone pestering or whatever,the way Sinatra did.He gave everything he did 110% and left all competition in the dust.That is why he was against retakes.As far as he was concerned, he did it right the first time and he had only to satisfy himself.If his critics didn't like it;well,that was their problem,not his.<br /><br />  This book gives an intimate look at his loves,passions,hopes,attitude and accompained with with his own antics to give everything he did the \\"Sinatra Class\\"Even when things went wrong,as they often did,he carried himself with class.A good example was when the Kennedy's snubbed him after having made a major effort in helping them win the Presidental election.<br /><br />  I saw him several years ago in Toronto giving a show with Liza Minnelli at the newly opened Skydome.The acoustics were a mess and he was way past his prime years.He had every reason to walk off the stage ,saying \\"Both you and I deserve better than this.\\" He didn't,in spite of it all,he gave a wonderful and memorable performance-and he did it with class.<br /><br />  Reading this book,you will realize that he came,he saw and he conquered;and there has been no equal since.Okay,if you don't agree,name just one.Even the superstars looked up to Sinatra.<br /><br />  Just a few quotes to entice you--<br /><br />  \\"Losers have the time to be nice.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Dallas (assination of JFK) was way above a mob rubout.\\"<br /><br />  \\"May you live a hundred years,and may the last voice you<br /><br />  hear be mine\\"<br /><br />  Sinatra's simple gravestone tells it all:<br /><br />  FRANCIS ALBERT SINATRA<br /><br />  1915 - 1998<br /><br />  \\"The best is yet to come\\"<br /><br />  In spite of everything,the author still drops by the grave and leaves a desert rose.Nobody who ever interfaced with Frank could ever forget him;and that includes his fans,and even his enemies,if there really ever were any.<br /><br />  In the final analysis,he gave much and took little.<br /><br />  Thanks,George,for relating your personal experiences and insights.It seems you knew and loved him as much as anyone,and maybe the feeling was mutual,even if it had to be in Sinatra's own way.e mine\\" <br />   <br />  Sinatra's simple gravestone tells it all: <br /> <br />        FRANCIS ALBERT SINATRA <br />            1915 - 1998 <br />       \\"The best is yet to come\\" <br /> <br />  In spite of everything,the author still drops by the grave and leaves a desert rose.Nobody who ever interfaced with Frank could ever forget him;and that includes his fans,and even his enemies,if there really ever were any. <br />  In the final analysis,he gave much and took little. <br />  Thanks,George,for relating your personal experiences and insights.It seems you knew and loved him as much as anyone,and maybe the feeling was mutual,even if it had to be in Sinatra's own way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-29

This is,without doubt,the best book I've come across about that dastardly act committed on 9/11.We have all watched many hours of televised newscasts and specials covering this event;but what this book does is put human faces on the people who were involved.<br />  The perpetrators of this act were filled with hatred and represent the many thousands of others like them who have bought into or have sympathy for an unbridled hatred called jihah.In contrast to them,are all the people who fell victim to this hatred and had their lives stolen from them, their families and friends.This book shows what it means to have good or evil in people's hearts.Unfortunately,the fight against terrorism will be long and difficult,but as history has shown time and time again,that good always prevails over evil.<br />  This book presents the facts and shows how the terrorists set out to attack America,the bastion for freedom and liberty for the world.They were encouraged by a lack of action,and further, took advantage of the freedoms enjoyed in the country and the great benefit of doubt given them by a country whose fundamental concept is of freedom and liberty of the individual,whoever he is.While they like to demand,and take advantage of this free society,would themselves deny it to others,and seek to destroy it while imposing their own sick oppression,tyranny and hatred on their own people and anyone else they can.<br />  While most of this book is very good,I take great exception to the attempt to compare 9/11 with Hiroshima,on page 247.<br />  \\"Perhaps the only comparable event in history was Hiroshima,but even Hiroshimahad had taken place in the context of a declared war.Hiroshima was a surprise attack but not a sneak attack.Sept 11 was both.Pearl Harbor,maybe,but no warped stretch of any demented imagination,can a comparison of 9/11 and Hiroshima be made!Any such thinking is deplorable.<br />  20 years of terrorist attacks going unanswered forced America to embark on The War on Terror.There is only one outcome that can be an option;and that has to,and will be, complete victory.Anything else is unthinkable.<br />  And then again, on page 251,\\"What happened in Hiroshima and in the terrorism [in New York] is the same because there are many people who can't recover one tooth or one nail.\\"Again,an unbelievable notion.<br />  A very important paragraph on page 250  deserves quoting.<br />  \\"Why were we hated so much? Hadn't we been on the Muslin side in Afghanistin? Didn't we help Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo? Wasn't it the case that millions of Muslins ,as<br />president Bush pointed out in his speech before Congress,practiced their religion freely in the United States of America,to which they had come of their own free will? Clearly,we had something to learn about the unreasoning and unreasonable anti-American fury that existed in the Muslin world,where Osama bin Laden was being treated  not as a villain but as a hero.There was a lesson there someplace,and it would be contemplated for a long time into the future.In the meantime,public support quickly built, not just for a retalitory strike,a few cruise missles launched at a target,but for a long and complicated war against an only semivisible adversary.The Bush administration vowed to fight that war for a long time ,against the terrorists themselves and against those who harbored terrorists,which in the first instance, meant Osama bin Laden and the Taliban of Afghanistan.\\"<br />  How can anyone who is unwilling to fight for freedom expect to live in freedom?<br />  I am writing this review just 4 days before the FREE ELECTION is to take place in Iraq.<br />  Many countries have failed to support America,and it appears many would be joyful if America fails in her War on Terror.America won't fail and is in for the long haul;just as she was in WW1,WW11,struggle against Communism and other wars.These countries should ponder the President,s words.\\"Either you're with us or against us.\\"<br />  On page187 we are reminded of what the President said on Septmber 11,2001:<br />  \\"Terrorism against our nation will not stand.\\"<br />  He has remained true to that promise.<br />  God Bless America!on Septmber 11,2001:    \\"Terrorism against our nation will not stand.\\"    He has remained true to that promise.

Not only that,the words to 'Danny Boy' were written by an Englishman,'Maggie' was written by a Canadian and 'I'll Take you Home Again Kathleen' was written in America, and was a promise to bring the writer's lover back from out west to New York;not from America back to Ireland.There is no end of the things that are not as they first might seem.One of my favorites is that 'The Birdman of Alcatraz,Robert Stroud,who did all that research on birds, while serving a life sentence for murder,did it in Leavenworth prison,not Alcatraz.<br /><br />  If you enjoy reading this sort of of thing;Ripley was the undisputed master of turning up this stuff,from all over the world.Although there have been many imitators,and some pretty good ones at that,he was the inventor and the best at the game.<br /><br />  I have been a big fan and reader of Ripley since I was about 10 years old,and I am now approaching 70.As a young lad I got his first Believe It or Not! and noticed it was recently reprinted as a reproduction and selling in a 'big box bookstore'.It is exactly like the one I had so many years ago.<br /><br />  Over the years ,I have read and collected many of these books over the years.My favorites were the paperback series that started in1950,and about 30 same out,Also many large 'Special' books like this one.Also a series of Comic books.Just when it looked like the end to his long trail,the TV series started.It,s been a long run and I've never tired of it because there's always new material. One of my favorite books about Ripley was 'Ripley -The Modern Marco Polo' by Bob Considine.In this book ,Considine,a pal of Ripley's, tells so much about Ripley that one realizes that his life was as wild and just as unbelievable as the stuff he wrote about.After all these years,his cartoon is still carried daily in nany newspapers.Unfortunately not here in Toronto,and maybe not where you live;but fear not,it's on the Net under 'Believe It or Not'.There are several BION Museums around the country with wonderful exhibits.I visited the one in Niagara Falls a couple of years ago.Enjoyed it very much,but surprised that they had no books to sell;hopefully that oversight has been corrected by now.<br /><br />  I must say the printing,paper,almost exclusive use of color photography,and overall construction of this book is excellent.I would like to offer just one bit of criticism,that being of some printing on top of pictures.This accomplishes very little other than making for difficult legibility.(examples are pages 59,78,134 144,153 & 179)<br /><br />  A great book for people off all ages.wonderful exhibits.I visited the one in Niagara Falls a couple of years ago.Enjoyed it very much,but surprised that they had no books to sell;hopefully that oversight has been corrected by now. <br />  I must say the printing,paper,almost exclusive use of color photography,and overall construction of this book is excellent.I would like to offer just one bit of criticism,that being of some printing on top of pictures.This accomplishes very little other than making for difficult legibility.(examples are pages 59,78,134 144,153 & 179) <br />  A great book for people off all ages. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-19

In all fairness we don't really understand much about the past;how could we hope to predict the future?<br /><br />  Can't say as I remember anyone predicting the recent Tsunami.<br /><br />  Don't forget the old adage \\"If you take the generally accepted wisdom at the time ;and take the totally opposite,you'll probably get closer to the truth\\".<br /><br />  Agood example was the Population bomb and Zero Growth stuff of the 50's and 60's.We were all going to be starving to death here in North America.What happened,now we have a major overweight problem.And guess what;nobody predicted all these fast food joints.And what about the idea that computers were going to hugely reduce the amount of paper.Oh well,we can't get it right all the time.Once in a while,though might be fun!	2005-01-11

A great little book to leave around to pick up and read in short 10 minute spurts.A good spot to leave it would be on the coffee table in the den or cabin;another would be on the bedside table.However a good suggestion would be to drill a hole in the top left corner,tie a string through it and hang it on a nail on the outhouse wall.If you're not fortunate enough to have such a fine Redneck facility;I suppose any modern bathroom would do.The only spot that might be impractical would be the shower stall.<br /><br />  The one-liners and thoughts abound in this book.Here are just a couple:<br /><br />  \\"Never insult an alligator until you have safely crossed the<br /><br />  river.\\"<br /><br />  \\"You know you're getting old when you know all the answers<br /><br />  but nobody asks the questions.\\"<br /><br />  \\"A farmer wears out two pairs of overalls growing enough<br /><br />  cotton for one.\\"<br /><br />  \\"I have never witnessed an ugly wedding or a pretty divorce.\\"<br /><br />  \\"The whole thing was about as much fun as midnight- to- eight<br /><br />  guard duty.\\"<br /><br />  \\"What does the term 'bare facts' mean to a nudist?\\"<br /><br />  \\"I don't understand what hermits do with their spare time.\\"<br /><br />  Now here is some real good stuff.Bo gives us a Dictionary of words you can't do without if you want to understand Redneck talk.Such as these:<br /><br />  BARD  \\"Lucy,I ain't loanin' Buster Bland nothin'ailse.<br /><br />  He bard my shovel an' didn't brang it bak.An he<br /><br />  bard my battry charger an' lost hit.\\"<br /><br />  BUB  \\"Johnnie Faye!

Now that I,ve just completed the 3rd book in the series,'By Sorrow's River',I am more convinced than ever that one benefits by getting these books together and reading them all,one right after another.Tonight is Christmas Eve and a little Elf told me that 'Folly and Glory' is awaiting under the Christmas Tree.<br /><br />  'By Sorrow's River' was a fascinating continuation of the spellbinding saga of the Berrybender expedition in the early West.<br /><br />  Every page produced another glimpse of this most unusual adventure.McMurtry continues to come up with fantastic lines ,observations and soul-searching thoughts.I guess this is what makes him one of the great writers around today.<br /><br />A few of my favourites:<br /><br />  \\"Life was never so good or so bad as one thought-\\"<br /><br />  \\"These damnable American freedoms-this democracy!-were clearly<br /><br />  inimicable to sound British order.Democracy could ruin a good<br /><br />  servant faster than gin.\\"<br /><br />  \\"What a pity there are no stocks anymore.\\"<br /><br />  \\"There's no calm like the calm of a battlefield,once the<br /><br />  killing's over.\\"<br /><br />  \\"We'll all leave husks someday,somewhere.Let's just bury them<br /><br />  and go along.\\"<br /><br />  \\"I don't even feel that I'm in a place anymore.Places have  boundaries or borders,and this goddamn place has neither.\\"<br /><br />  \\"I like to think of Eternity as having a constant temperature,<br /><br />  though.In the great peace of infinity there should be neither<br /><br />  hot nor cold-one can't say that of Neuvo Mexico.\\"<br /><br />  A great read;can't wait to read the finale!	2004-12-24

There is always something different cropping up in a Longarm novel.This one, Number 69,is an oldie,Sept,1984.I have read all the series up to this date ,plus several others from over the years .The series is still continuing and I believe it is up to 313 with the latest novel for December 2004;plus about 15 Giant double sized issued ,about one per year.<br />  This one No.69 is a typical yarn about an inside job of robbing the Army's money and Longarm solving the case.It is pretty lackluster but has a bit of a twist at the end.<br />However;there was one very unusual feature with this tale.Typically,Longarm shoots 7 or 8 owlhoots in confrontations in a story;but in this one he takes out only one and not until page 147.Is Longarm changing,or do we have a new writer on staff with an \\"agenda\\" of cleaning up his image?Don't tell me we'we hired a Socialology major/turned writer, who thinks Longarm needs counselling or god forbid,sensitivity training.Only kidding!	2004-12-23

This second book in the Berrybender Narratives is even wackier and woolier than the first book.I read Sin Killer over a year ago,see my review dated November 30,2003.<br /><br />  I purposedly decided to wait till I had the other three books before continuing.I am glad I made this decision because there are so many characters and stories involved ,that if too much time passes the story will get too foggy,at least for me.I strongly recommend that one reads them in order and read them as close together as you can.<br /><br />  Also,the multitude of characters makes it necessary to keep a \\"scorebook\\".Larry helps by giving a list of characters in the front of each book.I tagged it and added notes as I read the book.<br /><br />  All these characters are going to be great when the time comes,and it will,to turn the books into a movie or TV series.I am sure it will be every bit as good as Lonesome Dove.<br /><br />  As you read this book,never mind what's coming in the next chapter,of which there are 60,this book moves so fast,you never know what to expect in the next paragraph.It's a very fast paced read,with lots of great lines and statements.However,every so often Larry throws in some word to keep us on our toes.For instance:<br /><br />  lachryymose<br /><br />  pudendum<br /><br />  bastinadoed<br /><br />  Overall,McMurtry at his best!	2004-12-21

Although this book was published in 2002;I have the distinct honor to be writing the first Customer Review.In my opinion,Richler is one of the best Canadian writers,and if you've never read anything by him;this book should convince you.His perception,observation,experiences and expertise with language is simply masterful.<br />  This book is composed of material he wrote on sports over the years;the bulk of it from the mid-eighties.That means about 20 years ago.I would think that someone at least over 60 would relate more to this material than someone under 40.Personally,I lived in Montreal in the 60's,and was a diehard \\"Habs\\" fan and enjoyed seeing the Expos and The Worlds Fair come to Montreal.Those were very heady days.All that has changed and that whole excitement is now a thing of the past.<br />  Reading this book is very illuminating and answers the questions as to what has happened to sports and what is missing today.Richler really brings it home.Let me quote a few lines from his book.<br /><br />  \\"It isn't the stars who are expensive,it's the high price of mediocracy.\\"<br /><br />  \\"After you quit,though,it's a long time between Monday and Friday.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Beliveau led his team to 10 Stanley Cups in 18 years with the club as a player.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Dick Irvin used to say it doesn't matter haw hard you hit the glass or the boards,the light won't go on.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Big, handsome Jean (Beliveau) was a commanding presence,and as long as he was on the ice,the game couldn't degenerate into Ping-Pong:it was hockey as it was meant to be played.\\"<br /><br />  Richler shows how the sports stars played for the love of the game and it's enjoyment and particularly for the respect and admiration of the fans.In the off-season,they lived in the community and were very approachable.<br />  Regretfully,that is a thing of the past.He shows us how it has changed and why things went so wrong.<br />  Imagine,after the rich history of baseball in Montreal,the Expos are now gone and the Canadiens are a dynasty in memory only.<br />  Thanks Mordecai for a great collection and your total rejection of political correctness.<br /><br />  \\"He might be gone now,but<br />  Mordecai Richler kept his<br />  eye on the ball until the end.\\"<br />  The Globe and Mail<br /><br />  Mordecai Richler died on July 3,2001.Thanks Mordecai for a great collection and your total rejection of political correctness.      \\"He might be gone now,but     Mordecai Richler kept his     eye on the ball until the end.\\"           The Globe and Mail      Mordecai Richler died on July 3,2001.	2004-12-17

Trudeau continues to entertain us with his exceptional satire and cartooning.I have been a fan of his work for many years.His political observation never leaves a stone unturned;even when it should be.His artwork continues to advance the benchmark of drawing comics.The greatest thing we all lost with Kerry losing the 2004 Presidental Election,was what Trudeau had in mind for his character representation--oh,well.<br />  This book is very well sumarized in the editorical review,so I won't repeat.In this, one the strip is covered from Jul.1,2002 to Jul.19,2003.The book has 152 pages,of which 48 are in color.Too bad all were not in color because color adds a lot to the strip.In Toronto ,it is in color every day and I<br />I feel sorry for those who must be satisfied with black and white.That may be OK for Crossword Puzzles,but passe for comics.<br />  By the way,Check out the feature article on Doonesbury in the Aug 4,2004 issue of Rolling Stone Magazine.	2004-12-17

There are so many books about birds one wonders which are the best .There is no answer to that question.I have over 1000 'bird books' and I felt this one was worth buying.It is written by one of the most knowledgeable and dedicated birders in North America today.<br /><br />  His 'Birds of North America'is one of the best field guides for a birder to buy to carry with him to help learn about and identify birds.He particularly had the non-expert in mind when he wrote it.<br /><br />  His 'Kingbird Highway' is one of the best books around about his experiences as a 16 year old trying to beat the record of seeing the most species in North America in one year.<br /><br />  His 'Advanced Birding' was written for expert birders having difficulty sorting some of the toughest birds to identify.<br /><br />  Now he gives us a book filled with much more detailed information on each bird. He covers habitat,feeding,behavior,nesting,migration and the conservation status.He has also included up-to date range maps.He has written all this material in a very easy to understand manner.<br /><br /> One would not probably want to buy this as their first or only bird book;but it would be a great book to buy after having an identification book.It's a great book for any birder whether just getting started or been birding for some time.It is too large to take with you in the field (birding);but excellent to have at home for reference.	2004-12-08

Let me be the first to write a Customer Review on this book.At first glance, I thought it was going to be your typical Road Book by someone taking a long trip across or around America.I soon found that was not what this book was. The author is a staff writer for The New Yorker and I gather this book is a compilation of stories he has written for the magazine.A reader of the magazine will probably be familiar with Singer,but he was new to me.He is a great writer first, and an excellent observer of the human condition and experience.In many ways he reminds me of Jean Shepard,who used to have a nightly show on WOR New York in the early 1970's,made many appearances on the college circuit,and later did a great TV series \\"Jean Shepard's America\\".Unfortunately \\"Shep\\"  ,\\"passed into life's next adventure\\" a few years ago.see pg.167.<br />  Rather than travelling the roads and relating his experiencs,he takes us for a visit to 19 places  to witness some very interesting and first hand experiences of American life.In all cases we become the fly on the wallpaper and get a real insight into some unusual goings on. Thest are not once ever events .The reader could follow Singer's footsteps if he should be inclined to do.<br /> Here are several of the places he takes us:<br /><br />  Cockfighting in Oklahoma<br /><br />  Snowmobiling in Montana<br /><br />  Civil War Buffs in Louisians<br /><br />  Closing of a famous Family Diner in Lee, Massachusetts<br /><br />  A confrontation over The Pledge of Allegiance in Madison ,WI.<br /><br />  The execution of Timothy McVeigh in Terre Haute,In.<br /><br />  The Great Obituary Writer's Convention<br /><br />  Race Riots in Cincinnati,Oh.<br /><br />  The Great Worm Growing Scandal in Weleetka,Okla.<br /><br />  These are a great bunch of short stories for anyone who enjoys reading about life off the beaten track.<br />  Although this book was published in 2004,I am surprised that there haven't been more reviews written to date.	2004-12-06

When I bought this book ,I was buying it with my 40 year old son in mind.I thought I would glance at it, and Boy ,am I glad I did.My son enjoys Rock,and even plays a bit of it.I have'nt developed much of a feel for it,but really like Classic Country,Folk,Bluegrass ,Soul,Irish ballads and some Rock and Roll.As a matter of fact,I have heard of The Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia but I didn't even know that Mickey Hart was their drummer.So,I guess I'm really out of my league writing a review on this book;but here goes anyway.<br /><br /> This book bowled me over in a couple of ways.It really convinced me that all music is important and precious.That goes for Hank Williams singing \\"The First Fall of Snow\\",Woody Guthrie singing Philadelphia Lawyer,Elvis singing \\"Love Me Tender\\",Sinatra singing \\"New York,New York\\",Patty Reilly singing \\"The Town I Love So Well\\",the music of the Rain Forest,regional and tribal music from around the world, and even my son's Rock.<br /><br />  As a great lover of books,I can't begin to imagine what it would be like if we had nothing that was written prior to 1879.Well,that is exactly what Hart makes us think about,because there is not a single sound that was made befor that date,recorded,and can be replayed today.That thought is mind-boggling;and how many have even given it a thought?<br /><br />  Hart has made major contributions in trying to get the world's music recorded,particularly music from remote areas and cultures.A year or two ago I got the Asch Recordings,Vol.1-4 of Woody Guthrie ,by Smithsonian Folksways Recordings and even though I enjoy it very much,I had no idea what the background of it was--but thanks to this book,I can now appreciate it.<br /><br />  It takes someone with the talent and dedication of Mickey Hart to get involved and is certainly fortunate that he is on the Board of Directors at Smithonian Folksways.<br /><br />  Music and sound are as important as any other aspect of a culture and if not recorded is lost forever.<br /><br />Just think about it ,we have the physical remains of the ancient pyrimids of Egypt to look at or even visit,there are all kinds of written material surviving,but not a single sound of the activity and the songs that must have been sung as they did their work.We dont't have to go back 4000 years;there is not a single battle sound ,music or song surviving from the Civil War.That's why what Mickey Hart has to say in this book is so important.er.<br /><br />Just think about it ,we have the physical remains of the ancient pyrimids of Egypt to look at or even visit,there are all kinds of written material surviving,but not a single sound of the activity and the songs that must have been sung as they did their work.We dont't have to go back 4000 years;there is not a single battle sound ,music or song surviving from the Civil War.That's why what Mickey Hart has to say in this book is so important.	2004-12-03

I just came across this book a couple of days ago at my local 'big box bookstore'.I enjoy 'books about books'and this one certainly falls into that category.I have never paid much attention to bestseller lists for a couple of reasons.First,I tend to read mainly non fiction.I have found the fiction writers I enjoy,and except for Steinbeck,Twain and one or two others, are not on the bestseller lists.So,of all the fiction out there,new and old,I find so much to read that I don't need a list to tell me what is a bestseller and must be read.Although I have read several of the best seller writers,I haven't been enthused enough to read all their stuff;Larry McMurtry being the exception.I guess he falls into the one a year bestsellers;<br /> but even some of his are getting to feel like publish or perish books.To me, it seems that with most artists their early stuff is the best.I find that so with Steinbeck,Erskine Caldwell,McMurtry and most of my favorite writers.<br /> Merle Haggard once stated that his earlier work was his best because he lived the experiences then but not any longer.I find the same with authors.<br />  I found this book very good in that it demonstrates that best seller lists are something created and pushed by the book publishing and selling industry,and for their interests and not necessarily the buyers and readers of their products.In other words,it is primarily a marketing tool,and while probably very useful to them,not particularyy for the reader who finds his own treasures to read;and doesn't just read to follow what is being pushed in the media.<br />  The book business has had a very rough ride in the last several years and has tended to play catch up or as often said,\\"lead the parade from the rear.\\"This is very evident from reading this book.The customer (reader)will decide what to read not the marketeer.No matter how much the establishment tries to push their preference it doesn't change anything.<br />  A couple of statements in the book are very telling:<br />  \\"the bestseller list began to resemble a club that was hard to break into\\"  pg.172<br />  \\"Do you guys realize how much money the company would make if you only published bestsellers?\\" pg.173<br />  \\"\\"a publishing house that plays it safe,even if it satisfies<br />it's corporate parent,will sooner or later collapse.\\" pg.197<br />  \\"the bestseller lists of the nineties made for relatively depressing reading,except to accountants.\\" pg.199<br />  \\"In 1990,for example,the fiction list for the year contained not a single newcomer-all fifteen who made it were established,familiar bestselling writers,most of them on a yearly basis.It was,if you like,the triumph of brand-name merchandizing applied to books.\\" pg.196.

It's my great pleasure to be the first to submit a review on this wonderful little book.I almost passed it by for two reasons.First, it was not in the bookstore section where 'books on books' are usually found;normally in the section near Literary Criticism,etc.It was in the section of Antiques and Collectibles;which is where books on price lists of First Editions are found,which I don't find very useful and usually pass by.So,you never know where a good book will be.One of my favorites 'books on books' \\"At Home With Books\\" by Estelle Ellis was kept in the Home Improvement section.Secondly,since I have quite a few 'books on books',I thought this small fellow was insignificant.However,I thumbed through it, and found it very good.It is particularly up-to-date with modern book buying,book fairs,sales,remainders,and most of all the Internet world of books.Granted,it has overtones about it that collecting books is all about First Editions and Rare Book dealers;present day booking and building a personal collection for enjoyment versus profit is a great hobby.Not only that,it is far easier and much less costly than it ever was in the past.In the last 10-12 years ,I have built up a collection of 6,000 books at a very modest cost and a  lot of enjoyable searching.<br /><br />  This book is loaded with a lot of things for a person who reads a lot,enjoys having books around them,and wants to know how to acquire them at minimal cost,and at the same time having little interest in 'how much can I get for it'.Personally,I give most of my \\"extras\\" away when making room for more.<br /><br />  I have 'found' my books at many different places,all mentioned in this book in one way or another;and found the authors remarks right on the mark.<br /><br />  The Resource Guide in Chapter 4 including ,On-Line Resources,Books on Books,Collecting,Magazines,Associations,Sales,Supplies,Software,and Shops are all excellent and very up to date.<br /><br />  This is certainly a book you will want to keep after reading;particularly if you have a modest collection,which could be anything in excess of several hundred books,and love the hunt.

This book is a nice,safe,summary of the subject of earthquakes.What this book does is show that the knowledge of earthquakes is still in it's infancy;despite the fact that earthquakes have been around since the beginning of time;and studied,documented,and written about for almost as long.<br /><br />  It seems that each new quake tends to weaken any prediction theory built on the past.As a matter of faith,we all expect big ones to occur,but no idea of when or where.<br /><br />  The track record on earthquake prediction is to predict them in broad terms and far enough into the future that people forget about that prediction and occupy themselves with the latest guesses.On top of that,it always seems that after an earthquake occurs,all kinds of stuff comes out of the woodwokk that claim occurrences were taking place,and if only heeded,would have forewarned us of the quake;but invariably after the fact.<br /><br />  On the back of this book is a statement:<br /><br />  \\"The earthquake that rocked Early America and helped create a science.\\" I suggest that it may have helped create an industry;the science still remains to be developed.<br /><br />  Another book I recently read was \\"A Dangerous Place\\" by Marc Reisner,see my review of Sept 26,2004.He contemplates the inevitable consequences of a major quake occurring near Oakland,Calif. on the Hayward Fault.It's quite good.<br /><br />  It seems that the answer to the big one is still to be found.	2004-11-28

There are Joke Books,and there are Joke Books.All in all this one is pretty good.It is, however, somewhat different in a few ways.It has 1,473 jokes by 330 different comedians.One thing good about the book is that the author has included a brief note about each comedian at the end of the book.This is good,since many of the names were obscure or unknown to me.The jokes are arranged by subject,which is good and common in most joke books.It does not,however, give an index by comedian.This is not so good;and would be a good idea to note beside the comedians name in the appendix,the pages on which their jokes appear;this is normally provided.<br /><br />The jokes selected seem to come mainly from recent TV shows and Sitcoms;though not exclusively.They are almost all one-line statement jokes as opposed to story jokes like,\\"Did you hear the one about..?\\"<br /><br />  I get the impression that most of the jokes are written by writers and there is little or no personality associated with the comedian who tells it.Roger Dangerfield's are an exception as his material \\"belongs\\"to him.This is also true of Twain and Skelton.It seems that today ,most entertainment is written by someone for someone else and thus lacks the personal touch or individuality that you get when material is self-created.<br /><br />  Bunker,Gleason Myron Cohen,Lewis and Martin were not included;but Fields,Paulson,Skelton ,Twain and Hope were;I wonder why.<br /><br />  At least the author ignored the foul-mouthed stuff that is so common with stand-up comics today on the Comedy Networks ,and the book is better for it.It doesn't take bad language to make good humor;Twain,Gleason,Skelton,Dangerfield,Bunker and Mark Russell are proof of that.<br /><br />  Like I said,the jokes chosen seem to be mainly West Coast, Late Night Show ,TV Sitcom type and little or no Hillbilly,Country Bumpkin,Irish or Jewish Humor,Military,Insults,Dumb Blondes,etc.<br /><br />  I sure hope this is not an indication of how far wacky ideas of Political Correctness has gone.<br /><br />  I doubt that Mark Twain,Hal Roach,Myron Cohen ever told tales to hurt anyone.They put forth humor ;not agendas.rectness has gone. <br />  I doubt that Mark Twain,Hal Roach,Myron Cohen ever told tales to hurt anyone.They put forth humor ;not agendas.	2004-11-22

Keeping history in perspective is important.What is 200 years?I am creeping on to 70 and my father was born in 1891.So,it was only 85 years before my father was born that Lewis and Clark completed their journey.Another way to look at it is that Clark died in 1866 only 25 years before my father's birth.Not really all that long ago,when you think of all that has happened in that short time.<br /><br />  This is a very unique book,only 48 pages;but a real excellent effort.Scattered throughout the book are over a dozen packets containing authentic looking reproductions of maps,letters and other documents that were prepared along the trip.It's almost like handling museum documents.Also included are many excellent paintings of scenes along the journey as  well as sketches,maps and photographs of important items used.The paper,printing and overall construction of the book is superior in every way.At the back of the book there is a wealth of source material covering,acknowledgements,credits,notes and transcriptions.<br /><br />  All in all,a first class book on the Lewis and Clark Journey that shaped America.	2004-11-21

I found this a very good book, even though I skipped through several selections.First of all,this is not a book about the lore of Railroading.If it were, it would have been about the people who operated and serviced these wonderful trains.I knew many Railroaders and their jobs were much more than a job,it was a passion with them.My father was a Railroader and I grew up listening to all the stories about storms,accidents,breakdowns,late arrivals,special customers,hobo's, union strikes,and on and on.I can remember during WW11,the troop trains going through my town with all the windows covered.I also remember the company rounding up all available men to take \\"down the line\\" to help dig out by shovel the train stuck in a 20 foot deep cutting filled with snow.I made dozens of trips by rail in Nova Scotia;but none compared with the three return trips I made from NS to British Columbia ;particularly in the dome car.This book relates experiences these writers had in travelling by rail and while reading them;many similar memories were brought back to me.<br />  About the time I was finishing High School,my father asked me what I would like to do.Living in a small Railway town ;two \\"high tech\\" jobs were Dispatcher (Morse Code and all) and the Watchmaker who checked and repaired the Railroader's watches.My Dad said I should give it a little more thought.One day the watches won't need repairs and one day Morse Code will be replaced.Little did he know that not only are those jobs gone;but so is the Railway,trains,tracks,stations and people now say my town \\"used to be a railway town.\\"<br />  Overall this book has a large variety of stories ,by many well known writers and thoroughly enjoyable.	2004-11-11

Although I read and thoroughly enjoyed \\"A Star Called Henry\\"as well as all of Doyle's other novels;I was not aware that this new novel was part of a trilogy,\\"The Last Roundup\\".What a surprise I got when I saw it sitting there on the bookshelf recently.Not only that,by chance,I found that Roddy was doing a reading and discussion at the University of Toronto on Sept.27,2004.Of course,I attended and what a treat!He signed two of my books and had pictures taken.<br /><br />  His new book is great and full of surprises.He is a master at blending history and fiction.His writing style leaves one in wonderment.He uses words,sentence structure,phrases,etc.like a painter uses oils and brushes to create pictures on canvas.You will see what I mean by simply filpping through a few pages.<br /><br />  He writes about life in the US as masterfully as he does about Ireland.In many ways, he reminds me of Steinbeck, Erskine Caldwell and Larry McMurtry.Also like them,no two novels are the same;except for being excellent.<br /><br />  There are some great lines hidden amongst the storyline of this novel,ie;<br /><br />  \\"He was Louis Armstrong's white man.\\"<br /><br />  John Mc Cormack;\\"The voice that bridged the Atlantic.\\"<br /><br />  \\"You've got to speculate to accumulate.\\"<br /><br />  Referring to the Depression--\\"No colored man ever jumped out of a window 'cos his pockets went empty on him.Wouldn't be enough room on the sidewalk.\\"<br /><br />  \\"And brother,were I'm from is not the question.It,s where I'm going and if you're going with me.\\"<br /><br />  I just can't wait to hear this book on tape or DVD.On top of all this there's still another in the trilogy to look for with anticipation.<br /><br /> Oh,by the way, the cover of the dust jacket of my copy is very different than the one shown here.Mine has a picture of a record titled \\"Oh,Play That Thing\\";pat'd Jan.21,'13.as well as what appears to be an young trumpet player--Armstrong?My copy was published by Alfred A.Knopf Canada.	2004-11-07

The title of my review is what President Bush dictated to his daily diary on 9/11.<br /><br />  It was just by chance that I read this book after just completing \\"Dereliction of Duty\\" by Robert Patterson.(see my review of Oct 28,2004).Patterson's book describes how the Clinton administration dealt with Terrorism;while Woodward picks up after that period and covers in great detail,with the  help of many hours of personal interviews with the top administration of Bushes government,how actions were taken after 9/11.It is clear that the administration believed that \\"doing nothing was not an option\\".<br /><br />  Woodward takes us through every aspect of what happened,what options were considered,all possible consequences,people and personalities involved as well as the diplomatic efforts that were made to give every country the opportunity to get involved.<br /><br />  Very appropriately,I finished the book on the day of the 2004 Presidential Election.Slogans such as \\"Wrong War,Wrong Place and Wrong Time\\",\\"I would have done it better\\",\\"I have a better Plan\\",\\"Bush rushed in\\"(Iraq was invaded 18 months after Bush started The War on Terror);seem pretty hollow after reading Woodward's book,and it is clear that the idea that \\"everything is going wrong\\" that the media and liberals continually spin,was not bought by the majority of the voters and hence Bush won a second term.<br /><br />  Both books are so well written that the reader gets the feeling that he is present while all thes things are taking place.<br /><br />  If you decide to read these books ,I suggest you read them in the same order as I did.They lay out in great detail for you to come to your own conclusion how The War on error was,and is being handled.	2004-11-04

As a Canadian I had not paid much attention to President Bush.I guess the long episode over Lewinsky,the lead up to the election and relative calm of 2001 got our focus off politics.However; 9/11 changed all that.As these horrible events occurred, we were to learn of the outstanding leadership of the new President.One of my most lasting images is of Bush with his arm around the shoulder of retired fireman Bill Beckwith,standing atop the remains of a destroyed fire truck :<br /><br />  \\"Well I can hear you.\\"<br /><br />  \\"The rest of the world hears you.And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon\\"<br /><br />  This spontaneous remark came straight from the heart and soul of the great leader that the new President was.<br /><br /> Mansfield has written a marvelous book showing Bush's development from his childhhd days to the President.Bush is a man of faith and character and this is where he gets the moral compass that guides him.He knows he has \\"A Charge to Keep\\" and above all else intends to keep it.He does not believe in physobabble and navel gazing and credits his faith for \\"getting him out of the Texas bars and into the Oval Office.<br /><br />  The image portrayed by the leftist influenced Media could not be further from the truth.He learned a long time ago that the best way to fight back against the hatred and misrepresentation hurled at him is with conviction and kindness.<br /><br />  What his faith tells him is that \\"Evil will pass,but good is eternal.\\"<br /><br /> A lot of what we hear today is that there is no place for God in government or other institutions.This is as leftest as was the concept of dialectic materialism on which communism was based.It seems to me that when you look at the great leaders,thinkers and scientists ,almost without exception you find people of faith.Many say that Bush carries it too far.<br /><br />  Let me give a quote from this book:<br /><br />  \\"I have the feeling that God has created us and brought us to<br /><br />  our present position of power and strength for some great<br /><br />  purpose and up to now we have been shirking it.\\"<br /><br />  This is not a quote from Bush or the religious right but<br /><br /> President Harry S Truman.<br /><br />  I am extremely glad I read this book as it gives me a much greater understanding of what motivates the President.Would<br /><br />that we had a leader of such moral convictions in Canada.<br /><br /> The imps may be on the run in the US;but they are still holding court here!tion of power and strength for some great  <br />   purpose and up to now we have been shirking it.\\" <br />   <br />  This is not a quote from Bush or the religious right but  <br /> President Harry S Truman. <br />  I am extremely glad I read this book as it gives me a much greater understanding of what motivates the President.Would   <br />that we had a leader of such moral convictions in Canada. <br /> The imps may be on the run in the US;but they are still holding court here!	2004-10-21

What a surprise when I found this book.To think that after 40 years a refreshing new book on President Kennedy could still be published.All the photos were taken by Jacques Lowe,who was essentially the Kennedy family photographer.His photos show the personal and human side of Kennedy and the Kennedy family as well as the people who were close to the family.<br /><br />  Once JFK became President, things changed drastically,and we no longer saw the same kind of photos Lowe gave us.It is a shame  that Lowe did not continue on as the family photographer and hence continue with the personal glimpses he gave us.This book also has many photos which were not previously published,which show the real emotions of the people involved.Also surprising is how good the text is that accompanies the photos.<br /><br />  Of the many Kennedy books I own or have seen,none is better or more personal and character revealing ,than this one.<br /><br />  One can only imagine what a treasure trove went up in smoke when all of Lowe's negatives were lost in the World Trade Towers destruction on 9/11.<br /><br />  This is a large,heavy,well printed and bound book using top quality paper;a little expensive,but worth every penny.	2004-10-14

This is an excellent book.It is a detailed A to Z coverage on what and who the Terrorists are. Since war was officially declared on America, by the Terrorists on 9/11,America has no option but to engage in the fight and eventually win;regardless.<br /><br /> President Bush understood his responsibility to protect the safety of the people and the Nation that gave him that responsibility.It is clear from this book why he will do everything necessary to fulfill that obligation.He is aware that he alone can't do and know everything;but is determined to get all the help possible from government bodies and the military to win.He has made the case of this threat at the UN as well as other countries that it is in their interest to join and support him.Though many countries have turned their backs on America,Canada included,President Bush will pursue the course as the leader of the country attacked.He would tell you that there is  no other choice.His choice is made;other countries and organizations have to make theirs.<br /><br />  President is well aware of the futility of appeasement resolving anything except giving the enemy time to strengthening themselves and making the problem worse.This was amply demonstrated in the years leaning up to WWII,and more recently after the first attack on The World Trade Towers and other Terrorist attacks on America.<br /><br />  It's worth remembering:<br /><br />  \\"The price of doing nothing exceeds the price of taking action\\"<br /><br />  God Bless America.	2004-10-13

He talks directly to the reader as if you were his friend;and who wouldn't want to be one? On second thought, it is a lot easier to read and listen to Willie than trying to travel with him.Most couldn't last a week,and I must admit,me included.<br /><br />  The style of this book would be a good pattern for others to follow.He breaks it up with experiences and jokes.After all,really Willie just enjoys life and wishes the same for everyone else;except maybe for the IRS.The abundant photos are excellent and appreciated.<br /><br />  I particularly enjoyed Willie's comments about Ray Price,another legend,when he said:<br /><br />  \\"Ray Price is the greatest country singer ever,period.\\" That's an real tribute coming from someone of the stature of Willie.It says a lot for Ray,and even more for Willie.<br /><br />This book also contains a lot of Texas common sense,such as:<br /><br />  \\"There must be a better way to start the day than getting up.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Hell,what's wrong with being lazy sometimes?\\"<br /><br />  \\"It's almost April 15,don't forget o file your toenails by midnight\\"<br /><br />  \\"Remember the early bird gets the worm,but the second mouse gets the cheese.\\"<br /><br />  \\"No good deed goes undone.\\"<br /><br /> Great compasses to guide you.<br /><br />  Willie has shown he can be a great writer.If you've ever doubted how talented Willie really is,try to think of a writer who can write songs and play them like Willie does.<br /><br />  Hope you enjoy as much as I did!	2004-10-08

In all fairness this is quite a book.I found pictures here that were unlike any I've ever seen.There is a picture for each day of the year but I could see no point in tying the pictures to the calendar.By this  I mean,if the picture for May 16 were switched with the picture for Nov 10;there wouldn't be any difference;so what was the point.Furthermore, I can't imagine anyone reading this one day at a time;again what is the point?While there were some really interesting pictures;in many cases the explanation was very poor.At the same time, I enjoyed turning a page and being presented with a new scene.It was almost like travelling around the world,on a magic carpet,and dropping in on one amazing scene after another.This is what I felt merited 3 stars.However;to get the other 2 stars one would have to look to the description that accompanied each picture.Here is where the book comes up short.There also seems to be no theme to the book or even why these pictures were included rather than any others.It seemed to me that a group of people managed to get a lot of funding ,spent it running around the world,hiring helicopters and planes to get a lot of pictures,some of which were very different;package it all up for some exhibits and a book.All in all a nice collection of pictures;but then again National Geographic has been doing that for years but with a much better theme and purpose.<br /><br />  Finally,the picture for Oct.19,The Genbaku Dome is completely out of place in this book and included only for the purpoce of taking a cheap shot at the United States.Rather than being a \\"barbaric act\\";the USA played the major role of ending WWII,and the author would be well advised to consider who initiated the barbarism of WWII rather than who ended it.<br /><br />  I feel the people behind the book did a great disservice in allowing that remark to be included.	2004-10-08

Gibson has written an excellent book detailing why America is hated around the world.There have been several reviews that have given this book low ratings,but none dispute the fact that this hatred is rampant.<br /><br />  Hatred is a problem of the hater not the hated.This has been proven to be true throughout history;be it the hatred of the Jews by the Nazis,the Blacks by the KKK or anywhere it occurred.It has also been the domain of the hater to blame their victims of that hate.<br /><br />  In his chapter dealing with Canada,he has extremely well covered the situation here in Canada.He suggests that 85% of Canadians would vote against Bush and wished they could.My experience would agree with that assessment,he may even be understating the extent of anti-Americanism here in Canada.However; they use Bush as an excuse for what that hatred really is--anti-Americanism.That hatred was there long before Bush and will be there long after he completes his Presidency.However;Gibson was wrong when he suggested that Carolyn Parish,who said \\"Damn Americans.Hate those bastards.\\"(pg.209);would have her career ended as a politician.Sorry about that,she was just re-elected with a resounding majority.That proves how deep seated this hatred really is.<br /><br />  To those who disagree with Gibson,I would suggest that they are blinded by hatred.Whatever reason can one have for hatred ,but hatred itself? Hatred is the domain of losers,and when you look at where this hatred is held,you will see that all the people and countries that deal in hatred are losers.This is very prevalent among left-wing Liberals and Socialists in the US and abroad.And what else have these philosophies been than abject failures.So,these people must hate America for their own failures.<br /><br />  These haters should remember:<br /><br />  \\"Pride goes before the fall:<br /><br />  This world hatred will end up in the dustbin of history;as it always does.I was taken by Gibson,s idea that  many countries think they could run America better than Americans.Maybe if they  are so wise ,why have they done so poorly with their own countries?America has out performed them all,and in all ways.<br /><br />  I had the pleasure to work and live in the USA for 5 years and daily watched the construction of the magnificient World Trade Towers.It was with great sadness and horror that I witnessed Terrorists destroy them and the many innocent people.My time in America gave me an opportunity to see what a great Nation America is.The anti-Americian bias in our left-wing Media does not present this image;but gives a continual diatribe of anti-Americanism.<br /><br />  God Bless Americaica better than Americans.Maybe if they  are so wise ,why have they done so poorly with their own countries?America has out performed them all,and in all ways. <br />  I had the pleasure to work and live in the USA for 5 years and daily watched the construction of the magnificient World Trade Towers.It was with great sadness and horror that I witnessed Terrorists destroy them and the many innocent people.My time in America gave me an opportunity to see what a great Nation America is.The anti-Americian bias in our left-wing Media does not present this image;but gives a continual diatribe of anti-Americanism. <br />  God Bless America	2004-10-05

I enjoyed this book much less than I expected.About half way through I began looking forward to the end.When I finished the book I tried to think why I felt this way.I came up with a couple of things that may be the reason.First,this book was put together by two professors who may well know the facts;but that doesn't mean they can use the facts to make a good,entertaining or inspiring book.Upon finishing this book,a reader should thirst for more.My feeling was; enough is enough.Secondly,there seemed to be no overall direction but rather collecting up examples in very selected areas.Thirdly,the authors seemed to have an agenda to dispute statements attributed to liberal/socialist individuals by right wingers, but not the other way around.Being a good writer,like being a good teacher, means that one should inspire the reader or student to want to read or learn more.This book just didn't do it for me.	2004-09-29

All one can do is hope and pray for the best.	2004-09-26

This book is nothing more than 200 pages of smoke and mirrors.All Satin believes that is need to make the failed ideology of Socialism  work is to pile on more government and programs and sock the cost to taxpayers.Of course,he doesn't use the word taxpayer,he uses the word government when he talks about who is going to foot the bill.You see,taxpayers are the problem,they've learned to look after themselves.Socialist's clients are those who buy into the concept that they can't or won't look after themselves and hand it over to the government to do it.<br /><br />  Satin has spent decades as a dyed- in- the- wool Leftist and now thinks he's seen the light.His ideas are far to the left of JFK<br /><br />who believed that it was not the role of government to provide a person with a job but to provide the person with an opportunity to look after himself.Even he was a  Liberal;then along came Johnson with his War on Poverty,and after spending 3 trillion dollars on it ;the end result was that even a larger percent of the people were living below the poverty line.What else would you expect from Socialism.<br /><br />  Satin's ideas about proportional representation have already been rejected by another reviewer and all I would like to add is that, it is being pushed for here in Canada;and these proposers are not even Liberals,but Socialists.<br /><br />  Search as you may,for some enlightenment in this book;you will not find ideas like,self-reliance,taking on responsibility,pride in accomplishment,etc.What you will find is a load of ideas like programs,entitlements,assistance,government creating jobs etc.<br /><br />  Figure a way to take care of yourself,and don't fall for the idea that you need these Socialists to do it.They haven't done it anywhere else and you'll be sadly mistaken if you believe they'll start in the USA.<br /><br />  Even the author has come to the point where he went back and learned a skill to better his lot.You don't see John Kerry ,the great caring Liberal giving away anything.And how about Teresa when talking to people gathering up clothes to send to recent hurricane victims---\\"Let them go naked\\"was her help.anything.And how about Teresa when talking to people gathering up clothes to send to recent hurricane victims---\\"Let them go naked\\"was her help.	2004-09-21

This book has been around for quite a while;published in 1975.I came across it recently and got a kick out of it.The book is an easy 1-2 hour read.It is not so much a specific how-to book;but it does give examples of the type of hiding spaces that can be easily created by just about anyone;regardless of tools or skills.what is really needed is a bit of ingenuity.<br />  What the hider has to do is think of a cavity that exists or can be created that is large enough to conceal their \\"treasure\\".Of course the smaller the object ,the simpler the problem becomes.Another thing to consider is a way to indicate to you that someone has found your spot but hasn't let on.A good example of this is often used in a Western series I read called \\"Longarm\\".To tell if anyone has entered his hotel room and may still be there  is to insert a matchstick somewhere between the door and the doorjam.Should anyone enter it drops out.There are a lot of good ideas in the book,but I think the author has overlooked some very good and extremely simple ones.Examples I am thinking about are any jar,can,container, box,etc.especially if it also has something else more mundane in it.How about this for example.You want to hide a couple of keys .Why not put them in the middle of a glass jar of nuts and bolts and leave the jar on top of your workbench?Or wrap them in some tissue and shove them into the toe of an old boot?The point being to find a spot that the looker would dismiss as pointless or would mean an endless amount of useless time to search.<br />  You should also give some thought to what you should hide.Particularly if you are a homeowner;you should have a key hidden outside to be there for any family member should they forget,lose,or whatever need to get it.Somewhere as simple as in a cedar tree which doesn't lose its leaves.Under a stone in the garden might be OK someplaces;but maybe a poor choice here in Canada where there might bt three feet of ice and snow when you need it. Anyway, a great little book.As to any others like it;I noticed one by the same title by Michael Connor on Amazon,but I haven't seen it.<br />  After you,ve created your hideaways,your next problem is to devise a method of finding them if you've forgotten where they are.You might discuss the problem with the squirrels who hide nuts;but a coded list might be a better idea.<br />  Good reading,good hiding and good luck.<br />  Oh yeah,one more thing,what happens in the case of your demise,maybe someone will get lucky someday.<br /><br />mittle book.As to any others like it;I noticed one by the same title by Michael Connor on Amazon,but I haven't seen it.

My title refers to the book and not to the storm.<br /><br />  This devastating storm occurred on Oct 15,1954 and this book didn't get published 'till 1979.Twenty-five years after the fact gave plenty of time to produce a much better effort.What we got here looks like something that was thrown together by a bunch of people.Let's get someone to turn up some background stuff on the city and storms;someone can dig up a bunch of photos from the newspaper files;someone else can gather up a bunch of personal experiences and \\"bam\\" we got a book.All we need is enough to fill 175 pages;it's easy.This could have been done in a couple of weeks using newspapers and not much talent.<br /><br />  Quite frankly,it takes a lot more than that to write a good book.<br /><br />  A city without a vision and elected officials and uninspired bureaucrats is what should have been uncovered.Also the reasons for the lack of accountability of those charged with and paid to protect the city and its people was the real issue;especially with 25 years to look into this disaster.<br /><br />  The Parochialism and lack of vision that existed in the 50's is still the order of the day;in spite of the stupendous growth in the city.One only has to look at the traffic gridlock,unimanginative development along the lakefront and lack of infrastructure completed during this growth.<br /><br />  While the storm resulted in huge personal tragedies,repairs have been made,the systemic problems and  attidudes remain.This book doesn't even begin to deal with this.	2004-09-12

To write such a readible book on such a complicated subject is no mean feat.Bodanis has pulled it off in spades.<br /><br />  One should not shy away from this book because they might think it is too difficult for them to understand.Even though I finished studying engineering 40 years ago;I found it a very easy read,and anyone with a High School background would have no trouble with it.<br /><br />  Bodanis shows how a handful of scientists discovered the source of energy and how mankind could use it;all in a short span of about 25 years.Even with the great advancement we have already seen we are only at the beginning of learning what the universe is all about and what still awaits mankind in the future.<br /><br />  After reading this book,one is left with the thought \\"You ain't seen nothing yet!\\"It is also interresting how Bodanis has shown that these geniuses were ordinary people in many ways and how they struggled with the establishment and personal relationships;just as the rest of us do.<br /><br />  If you can think of trying to explain to a person who was seeing his first machine in the 1800's;a spinng wleel for instance,and then imagine his wonderment if told about a spaceship;you get the sense of what lies ahead from our present endeavors in space exploration.It boggles the mind!<br /><br />  Also,about a third of this book is jam-packed with references for future readings.<br /><br />  While very enjoyable on its own,this book is worth keeping as an excellent reference.Check it out;you'll be glad you did.	2004-09-06

Stein and  DeMuth have shown how America is in a grand struggle,particularly since WWII.Forces have been at work in dismantling the values that have made America the beacon of light and freedom in the world.Rather than being attacked from outside,America is under seige from within.The Founding Fathers belief in God and the building of a country on that foundation made America the greatest country the world has ever seen.However ,the godless forces at work today have been very successful in their efforts to destroy these values.This has happened in other countries in the past,but no matter how dark the period becomes;Socialism,Facsism and other evil isms are eventually defeated.<br /><br />  If you read only one book on the health of the American Dream-Freedom;and want to know how and why it is under attack--read this book.<br /><br />  As powerful as Communism was,it finally collapsed,and so too will thea gendas of the Godless left in America.The same kind of things are taking place,if not more so,in Canada,and there is little voice being raised against these destructive agendas.<br /><br />  While the good will eventually prevail,we may see much more of this madness before these agendas of the non-elected are defeated.

This book doesn't live up to its billing.Although there is a bit about the origin of Halloween and its evolvement over the centuries;it's pretty superficial and not developed.<br /><br />  Far too much of the book is about the degutting of Halloween and the movie industry and its horror films since the 1930's.<br /><br />  Halloween is about one particular day ,while the stuff this book is padded with is just horror , ghost material and the version put out by the Martha Stewart mentality.An in depth effort on Halloween would take much more research than displayed and purported to be a \\"cultural history\\".<br /><br />  This book has about as much depth about Halloween as a book about Frosty the Snowman would have about Christmas.But then again,people  who see Christmas as a commercialized holiday of nothing more than festive lights and gifts might feel this book tells all there is about Halloween.<br /><br />  A more appropiate title for this book might have been\\"The dismantling and misreprentation of Halloween since the 1930's\\"	2004-08-07

Thompson	Books	5	1	1	N	N	"I said it was a rumor to that effect.I made up the rumor.	Just finished this great unauthorized biography of HST.After having read several of HST's books,I was curious as to what he was really like and what made him tick.I am also a long time fan of Trudeau's Doonesbury and see the obvious similarities between the Duke and HST.Though a very enjoyable read, HST still remains as mysterious as ever.Maybe Perry has told us everything possible,and we might just as well accept him at face value. We're not ever likely to find out from the Dr. himself,whether he even knows or much less cares.The book gives us a lot of insight into his women folk and some of his cohorts.I use the word cohort because from this book I got the feeling that the idea of a friend is very different in the mind of HST.The most curious character that comes out in the book is Ralph Steadman.,the artist who seems to be cut from the same log as Hunter.It is definately a shame that about 20 or so of his drawings were not included.The cover certainly whets one's appetite for more.Anyone who has read a HST book should really like Perry,s book.<br /><br />  A late note!!!<br />  The Doctor died on Feb 20,2005.<br />  Rolling Stone Magazine has devoted practically its entire March 24,2005 issue to Hunter S.

Wallis's book has a lot more photos,including all from the 1989 book and much more detail about the musical chairs of band members.However,to get a better feel of Hawkins and the many stories,I prefer the Goddard book.There are so many stories over the years around Hawkins and his friends,I found it dragged a bit when the author gets into the band mrmbers,songs and record companies.Let's not forget; it is the characters that made Country, Rockabilly and Folk the grass roots music of the people-not the industry establishment.<br /><br /> That's what is missing today where everything is sanitized to meet the market.<br /><br /> The giants of music from the 50's,60's and70's were great becuse they were outside the mold.<br /><br /> Hawkins was and still is one of the best Entertainers and Characters.<br /><br /> And to think that he got poor marks for Music in High School!	2004-07-31

This is a rather different approach to a biography.The author admits that he never actually met Cash,but researched a lot of what has been written by and about him over the years.It is a good place for someone who doesn't know much about Cash to start  and there are numerous references and leads to follow up on.The tone of the book is very much like a textbook and has very little in the way of passion either about Cash or his music.There are a lot of references to liner notes and other written material;but little if anything that is new or original.There is also no indication that the author had any love or admiration for Cash the person or his music;but just decided to review what was available (of which there is an awful lot) and produce a book.It is a good book to add to others about Cash;but is completely overshadowed by &quot;Johnny Cash&quot;the Autobiography with Patrick Carr.(see my review on it).<br />  I thought it might hav been titled &quot;An Encyclopedia of Cash&quot;;but it is too superficial for that.The list of albums and books is too incomplete for even that.Nonethelessit is still a good read.	2004-05-24

This is an excellent book covering all the weapons that are available to fight an enemy,now and in the near future.Of course,as the title suggests, it leans on non-lethal weapons.This is not a book of Si-Fi stuff because we have already seen the use of many of the weapons described,although many have been used in various degrees,locations and purposes.As the author shows,there are many forms of weapons that do not involve a projectile or explosives but nonetheless have huge impact in warfare.Elimination of supplies,exploitation of media,disruption of communications,just to name a few.Non-lethal weapons have the greatest effect when the enemy has little or no knowledge of the other sides capability or use involved.Breaking of the German and Japanese codes was an excellent example of this 50 years ago.There has never been any magic bullet nor any new weapon that lasted too long before the other side found a counter weapon;so the way to maintain superiority lies in the ability to keep ahead.The reason America has managed to keep ahead in this is the extremely high value it places on the safety and security of every one of its citizens.Above all else this is the number one responsibility of the government.<br />  This book shows not only the types of weapons that are available but also the thought process that goes into deciding which best solves the threat involved.Reading this book will convince you why any nation which truly values it freedoms must spend the resources to maintain superiority in all forms of weapons. Being second best is not an option.	2004-04-14

This is an excellent account of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis.This is not a commonly known story.I first heard about this ship in a book &quot;Double-Edged Secret&quot; by W.L.Holmes.That book gave a good understanding of Intelligence in the Pacific Theatre during WW2.In it, there was mention of the possibility that it was known that the sub was in the area of the Indianapolis, but that intelligence was not passed on for fear of comprosmising the knowledge that the US had broken the Japanese codes.See my review on that book dated 5 March 2004.<br />  There are numerous  reviews on this book,so I won't express<br />many of the ideas already covered ,other than to say they are very good and I agree with most of them.<br />  However;after reading both of these books,the mention of ULTRA on page 265 takes on a great importance in the prevention of the loss of the Indianapolis.It's highly possible that secrecy of decoded intelligence  overruled all else .Remember the Indianapolis's mission was tied to the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.There was nothing of greater secrecy or importance at that time. Much was said in Holmes,s book of the great burden that intelligence placed on those who had to make decisions of how much could be told when sending forces IN HARM,S WAY.<br /> This book shows that ,particularly in times of war,many things are never fully known.	2004-04-08

This book captures in photographs one of the most terrible acts against the United States in history.The thing that makes this act so evil is that it was committed against people at peace.In all the pictures there is no sign of the perpetrators,no sign of any military ,only the shock and horror on the faces of people who started out their day in peaceful pursuit of their lives.The pictures show that those involved had no idea of what or why this terrible thing was happening.It is hard to think of another event in history that compares.Bad as Pearl Harbor was,the people who were attacked knew who the enemy was and why they were being attacked.This was not the case on 9/11.This is what separates terrorists from an enemy.<br />  What makes this book so good is that it can be quickly turned to every once in a while as a reminder of this day any why the War on Terror must be pursued to end this threat to all people who believe in freedom.This book shows what terrorists are capable of with or without weapons of mass destruction.No other proof is needed.	2004-04-04

This is a very interesting book,even for someone living outside the United States.Whether O'Reilly is liberal or conservative ,he claims neither,doesn't really matter.What he proposes is to go look for the facts and logic and come to your own conclusions.The truth is usually secondary to the agendas of diehard political Liberals or Conservatives;particularly those who can see only good in their side and bad in their opponents.<br /> The situation in Canada is not too very  different from that in the US except here there is very little conservative media , but more of a mixture of liberal and socialist agendas.<br />  The subjects that O'Reilly discusses;music,country,right to know,religion,poverty,freedoms,truth,loyalty,friendship,honor,<br />family,and so forth are not the domain of politics as much as those with agendas would have us believe.I think O,Reilly shows that those with agendas are out for themselves and beat the flames of problems rather than contribute to solutions.<br />  It is evident that there have been ,over the years,Presidents who were strong,weak,good,bad,right,wrong,and so forth and of all political stripes.<br /> As an example; Truman,Kennedy,Johnson,Reagan and Bush all did what was in the best interest and the well being and security of the country and all faced objections ;a lot from those whose interests were self motivated.<br />  The important thing to think about on any issue, is in whose interests is someone working.Take education for instance.In a discussion on private schools,is it not the interests of the students and the people who are paying the costs most important?Many would have you believe those people aren't capable and the decisions should be left to government and the education establishment.Let's face it ,their interest is self preservation first and education second;logiclly it can't be otherwise.<br />  Read this book with an open mind.The idea that one should take responsibility for themselves,and not surrender it to someone else is...to quote an old line...self evident...to quote an old line...self evident.	2004-03-28

Another good book on the subject of doing a Big Year in birding.There have been others written before.The classic for North America is \\"Wild America\\" by Roger T. Peterson and James Fisher written in 1955 when their goal was to see 600 birds in one year.There have been others since, which pushed the bar to the 700 level.One of the best in my estimation was Kenn Kaufman's \\"Kingbird Highway\\" personal story  of getting 671 birds in 1972.He did this at 18 without a car,or even a driving license,all for under 1000 dollars,including half of which went for plane flights to Alaska.Now there's a challenge to beat!<br />  This new book now has birders competing in the 700's.Where is the limit,who knows.You'll have to read the book to find out which of the three won.I will tell you this much,715 was not enough.<br />  While an excellent book;I believe there is a screaming ommission.There should have been a checklist showing which birds each one got as well as those missed.This would have taken only a few pages and would have set the standard for future books of this type.The book would also have benefited from the inclusion of some photos of several of the people involved.<br />  There was an excellent article about this book in the 19 January 2004 edition of Sports Ilustrated.It included several photos and several of my non-birding friends told me they really enjoyed it.<br />  A great read for all birders as well as anyone who enjoys competition and perseverance.<br /> This in an update.The book was made into a movie by the same name and was released in 2011.I went to the movie and it was excellent .See my review of the movie dated January 13, 2012.	2004-03-27

Cash was even larger than the life he led.I saw him live several times over his long career .The first time in Montreal with the Statler Brothers in 69;as well as numerous times on TV.The one thing I found was that he remained the same person throughout those years.As much as you thought you knew about him,there was always something new to learn.He was not one to think he was better than someone else.Despite his greatness,he possessed even greater humility ;particularly to his God,his family and to everything around him.This book really shows how much he loved everything;be it his faith,family,June,band members,homes,books,music,fishing,Rover,being on the road and with his fans or even his time alone ;these things meant so much to him,but in the end he always knew everything was temporary and none of all this swallowed him up.He believed ,that as much as he was given in this life,there was much more waiting for him in eternity.It's often said that it must be hard for the rich and famous to die and leave it all behind.Cash would not have subscribed to that thinking.This is why his fans always felt he gave them so much and why they loved him so much.<br />  Cash was one of the icons of the music world,and one of my favorites.I just wish I had the opportunity to thank him in person;but I know what he would have said.&quot;You are very welcome,I'm glad you enjoyed it and the pleasure was all mine&quot;<br />  Sure we'll all miss him,we had him for a long time,but he gave us so much and thanks to all his recordings,we still can listen to his songs.The photo on the back of the book,showing him dressed in black,walking away with his guitar,tells it all.He came,he gave it his all,now he's gone.<br />  Thanks,John,we're going to miss you.<br />  I highly recommend this book,no matter how much you know about Cash.Reading it was like a short visit with him.	2004-03-23

This is a book about military intelligence in the Pacific during WWII.This is not a mystery or work of fiction,but an account of what went on in the gathering and distribution of information by someone who was intimately involved from the beginning to the end.First of all,this is not a new book.It was written in 1979,34 years after the war.Published by Naval Institute Press ,also a Book Club Edition and later reprints.That it is basically a memoire,and that it is still in print gives a hint to its wide acceptance.<br />  Probally the reason that it was not written sooner had to do with the declassification of material.Upon reading the book,I was convinced it was only Holmes intimate knowledge of events and personal friendships in both the US and Japanese communities that enabled such an insight to surface.It is interresting to ponder if more would come out if the book were to have been written this year.Personally,I doubt it,but who knows.<br />  To think this whole story could be told in only 215 pages is surprising.There were huge numbers of people, events,ships battles and what not,contributing information,which all interrelated to make up the intelligence which was as big as any other weapon;if not the biggest weapon of all.Holmes shows that the US intelligence was so superior to the Japanese that the US even knew when the Japanese were deluding themselves about accomplishments;and the Japanese didn't even suspect the US knew.<br />  It's a good thing all the maps were included,because without them it would have been very difficult to follow.Another thing that was a bit of a chore was keeping track of the ships and subs;but again,Holmes did a commendable job of this in such a short book.It would have been interresting to know a little more about the methods these people used in breaking the codes.I guess that would be a bit too much to expect;either because of the complexity or the secrecy involved.<br />  It,s interresting to speculate ,after reading this book,about Bin Laden running around the mountains and caves with a walki-talki;and then think about the sophisticated surveillance available to keep tabs on him and his supporters.You can bet there,s a lot more going on that we see on the CNN News.<br />  Holmes also points out the difficulty when using gained intelligence ,the risk of revealing its own secrets or sources.<br />  &quot;Intelligence, like money,may be secure when it is unused and locked up in a safe.It yields no dividends until it is invested.&quot;<br />  A very good,but different,military book.n Laden running around the mountains and caves with a walki-talki;and then think about the sophisticated surveillance available to keep tabs on him and his supporters.You can bet there,s a lot more going on that we see on the CNN News.<BR>  Holmes also points out the difficulty when using gained intelligence ,the risk of revealing its own secrets or sources.<BR>  &quot;Intelligence, like money,may be secure when it is unused and locked up in a safe.It yields no dividends until it is invested.&quot;<BR>   A very good,but different,military book.	2004-03-05

This book has received mixed reviews;therefore my expectations were not high when I started it.The first couple of events didn't excite me too much,but then they happened so long ago and I am not too familiar with those times. The more I got into the book ,the better I found it.The author gives very good summaries of events that in most cases were very complicated.This is not simple,but coming from a background of a journalist he does an excellent job.I find most history writing is too detailed even to the point of being an exercise in drudgery.The author is crisp and only drags out the story enough to set the scene.Then he goes into a good description of the weather condition and how it impacted the event.He shows in these events that the weather conditions had much more impact on the outcome of the event than the skills or the weapons of the forces involved.<br />  I have read extensively about The Great Potato Famine and was impressed how well he covered this massive event which was very complicated,extended over several years,and did it in only 18 pages.In addition ,he really brought out the effect the weather had;a factor that is not usually as well emphasized.<br />  A book of these shortened historys also reminded me of somewhat &quot;corresponding&quot;(in want of a better word) events.For instance I had never given it much thought that The Red Army launched it's defense of Moscow on Dec 6,1941 the day before Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.Another thing was that at the same time that Napoleon was trying to take Moscow the British and the Americans were fighting the War of 1812 in North America.<br /><br />The book has many other little gems:<br />  The Potato Famine in Ireland may have had it's roots in the American Potato Blight of 1844.However;this may be of some question as I believe the blight also occurred in several other european countries.The effect elsewhere was nowhere as disasterous as the other food supplies were not shipped out of those countries by the landowners as happened in Ireland.<br />  Two other cities ,Kokura and Niigata were ahead of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as targets;but were by-passed because of weather conditions.<br />  The author also tries to make one think of how future events,particularly wars will be influenced by weather.<br />  Finally he reminds us that...<br />  &quot;Man has managed to harnass almost everything.<br />  But God still controls the elements.&quot;<br />  By the way there is an excellent Bibliography and Index at the end of the book.<br />  Durschmied also mentions that he's working on a new book &quot;The Snow Owl&quot;--I'm looking forward to it.ndowners as happened in Ireland.<BR>  Two other cities ,Kokura and Niigata were ahead of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as targets;but were by-passed because of weather conditions.<BR>  The author also tries to make one think of how future events,particularly wars will be influenced by weather.<BR>  Finally he reminds us that...<BR>  &quot;Man has managed to harnass almost everything.<BR>   But God still controls the elements.&quot;<BR>  By the way there is an excellent Bibliography and Index at the end of the book.<BR>  Durschmied also mentions that he's working on a new book &quot;The Snow Owl&quot;--I'm looking forward to it.	2004-02-28

It is very well written and without a doubt exceedingly well researched .Although I am not a gambler,I found it gave an excellent look at life in the world of high stakes gambling.As with any profession there are all sorts at the top.I like the comment by Oscar Wilde who said,&quot;There are not good or bad people,only interesting or dull people.&quot;Amarillo Slim has to be one of the most interesting in the world of gambling which has always had some great characters.Slim is portrayed as a gentle giant but hard as steel.<br />  This book is full of surprises.For instance;supposedly Minnsota Fats couldn't read or write--that's not to say he wasn't a super communicator.The most important ability that comes out as a fundamental requirement for a successful gambler is not knowing the ability of your opponent but knowing your own ,keeping an edge and living with the odds,win or lose.This is true in all walks of life.Here we see that even Slim breaks the rule at times,as in the episode with the alligator and shows even he is human.If there was any idea he always had to contend with it was :<br /> &quot;A guy like me ain't supposed to be scared of nobody.&quot;.<br />  The book is full of good Texas talk and wisdom;for example;<br />  &quot;Straight pool was about as obsolete as washing clothes<br />  on a rock in the river.&quot;<br />  &quot;You can bet whatever you can pay off.&quot;<br />  &quot;Texas Dolly is hotter than a widow woman's love.&quot;<br />  &quot;Stay close to your friends and even closer to your enemies.&quot;<br />  &quot;Don't p--- on my shoes and tell me it's raining.&quot;<br />  &quot;You can shear a sheep many a time,but you can skin it only<br />  once.&quot;<br />  And finally;<br />  &quot;Don't argue,if there's anything worth arguing about,either<br />  bet on it or shut up.&quot;<br />  Hope you like it,I sure did!	2004-02-25

The best way to read this sequel is immediately after reading its prequel;\\"The Desert Rose\\".The surprising thing is that McMurtry wrote \\"The Desert Rose\\" in 1983 and \\"The Late Child \\" didn't come out till 1995. That's a long wait!<br />  Again, this story continued along the same path.Even more so, the thought processes of the characters reminded me of the characters in many of Erskine Caldwell's novels;the most well known being \\"Tobacco Road\\" and \\"God's Little Acre\\".<br />  McMurtry's immagination never seems to slow down and you are presented with one wild thing after another,with each turn of a page. The chapters are very short,many only a couple of pages;but he puts more in one of those short chapters than most writers put in 30 or 40 page chapters.<br />  This book has a plethora of great lines;for example:<br />  \\"Your standards are the standards of a doormat.\\"<br />  \\"Dick don't have enough imagination to get lonely.\\"<br />  \\"Rog don't have a speed-neutral ain't a speed.\\"<br />  \\"That's how I feel,I just don't know how to live.\\"<br />  \\"Stuck in the driver's seat and the car was moving,<br />  but she had no map and no idea of where she was supposed<br />  to go.\\"<br />  \\"The fact is,it's a living death,and I've lived as long as<br />  I can.\\"<br />  \\"It ain't hard to die when you've already stopped living.\\"<br />  This has been a great read,and I hope Larry is working on a trilogy;Lord knows he has created enough characters who would be fun to follow.However,please don't make us wait another 12 years.	2004-02-24

Not a typical McMurtry novel;but then again none of his are.I've had this book for a long time as well as it's sequel &quot;The Late Child&quot;and for a change of pace decided to give it a try.<br />  It is a great read.Somewhat like &quot;Tems of Endearment&quot;;but more along the lines of &quot;Cadillac Jack&quot;;which was my first McMurtry novel and probably my favorite.As a matter of fact I would'nt have been surprised if he has shown up somewhere;maybe at one of Myrtle's garage sales.<br />  McMurtry has put together a great bunch of characters who all belong with one another.Kind of like the cast you find in a novel by Erskine Caldwell,Kinky Friedman,Hunter Thompson or even Steinbeck.These characters come from a different slice of life . These are the personal lives of the people who live very public lives in the Las Vegas entertainment world.In spite of it all, these are real people.Mc Murtry shows it is a tough world and eats up the workers and gamblers and spits them out when they reach the end of their prime or run out of cash.Rather than being Rednecks I guess you'd have to call them Pinknecks.They are somewhat akin to those loveable characters we know as Carnies.<br />  Anyway, the book is a great,fast moving read with a surprise on every turn of a page.A lot of characters and I'm glad I made notes as they appeared so I could keep track of them.<br />  Liked it so much I'm reading &quot;The Late Child &quot; next to see what happened to all these characters.It's surprising that so much time went by between this book and the sequel--12 years.	2004-02-20

Pessimism and defeatism will not win this war.9/11 proved that appeasement,blindly trusting tyrants and ignoring reality only encourages these evil intentions.America did not seek this war but she will win it ;for the simple reason that there is no other option.What it costs to win the war is not an issue any more than it was in the Civil War,WW1,WW2 or the Cold War.<br />  As the war proceeds, it is important that America looks at the actions rather than listening to the rhetoric of countries to determine which are her friends and which are not.America's friends may well change.As John Manyard Keyes said &quot;When the facts change I change my opinions&quot;.<br />  The authors conclude with this...<br />  &quot;A world at peace,a world governed by law,a world in which all peoples are free to find their own destinies.That dream has not yet come true,it will not come true soon,but if it ever does come true,it will be brought into being by American armed might and defended by American might too.America's vocation is not an imperial vocation.Our vocation is to support justice with power.It is a vocation that has earned us terrible enemies.It is a vocation that has made us,at our best moments,the hope of the world.&quot;<br />  This was proven in WW1 ,WW2 and the Cold Was and will be again in The War on Terror.<br />  The leaders of the terrorists should remind themselve of the words of the Japanese commander after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor..&quot;I fear all we have managed to do was to awaken a sleeping giant&quot;.se attack on Pearl Harbor..&quot;I fear all we have managed to do was to awaken a sleeping giant&quot;.	2004-02-19

In reality it is not the history of our land that is boring;but the people who have led our institutions and the agendas of those who have been installed in them.<br />  It's natural to compare ourselves to the Americans and their history,but that is pointless because as soon as they were able they drove out the European control by Revolution and set about to create One Nation with their own principles.<br /> That was not the case here.We continued to be colonies and preferred to be led by the mother country mentality of England and France through Peace,Order and Good Government.Therefore, since these two countries were never in agreement,why would one expect that creating a country based on the principles of both of them end up with a Nation which would be united throughout.<br /> Hence,having gotten off on this approach ,we have always confronted our devevopment issues with a strong determination that above all else compromise would rule.<br /> There was a glimmer of light after the two World Wars that we might get on with creating One Nation that was for all of us,but those deep seated divisions only became enlarged.<br />  Take something as basic as our flag;rather than unison ,every province now has their own,where most did'nt even have one and Quebec has given it little notice,other than a great lack of disinterest,to put it mildly.<br />  So, rather than working towards unity we compromised with the misguided concept of Bilnguialism and Biculturalism.All that has done is to emphasize the past differences and drive us further apart.If that wasn't bad enough,we dreamed up the idea that since the Americans believed in the melting pot to create One Nation;we cound'nt do that,we went the Multicultural route and encouraged retention of the very ideas that these new arrivals were leaving behind.<br />  Now we wonder &quot;Who Killed Canadian History?&quot;<br />  There,s little doubt that the leftist ideologies that permeate our government and government agencies has carried us down this road. The idea that &quot;we know what's good for you&quot; and don't bother yourself,we'll take care of you is firmly entrenched.What ever happened to the idea that it is my responsibility, particularly since I'm paying for it.I am entitled to have a say.<br />  The book very well outlines the problem.He shows that Political Correctness ,an oxymoron,by the way;is rampant,but doesn't dwell on how it became so established.<br />  As a matter of fact he even suggests that the solutions should come from the same educational establishments that created the the problem. I don't think so !The only way out is to take that establishment totally apart,get rid of the vast majority holding these destructive agendas and rebuild the whole system from the bottom up. Education should be universal using a merit,performance based,voucher system where the people who pay for the education have some say on how their resources are to be spent.This will not be offered by the establishment;but must be wrestled away from them to get education out of its quaigmire.s carried us down this road.

It was also a war in a much more literal sense,a war of attrition.Our strategy in constantly upping the ante in the arms race was to push the entire Soviet system to the breaking point.And of course,that strategy succeeded.The Cold War is over,and we were the winners.&quot;<br />  The book is well researched,well written and very informative.	2004-02-14

This is the first book I've read that is totally about the Great Depression.However,I have read all of Steinbeck's,Erskine Caldwell's and numerous by and about Woody Guthrie as well as many about Capone and other Gangsters.While these were all about the same period,they tended to zero in on specific ways of life,even though one aspect of the depression did not escape the effect of another.The black sharecroppers in the Deep South of Caldwell,the bootlegging,clubs and turf wars of Chicago of Capone and Ness,the Dust Bowl migrations of the Oakies of Steinbeck and Woody Guthrie give detailed insight of people living through these times but but each went on almost oblivous to each other.What Watkins has done is to deal with every<br />thing during the Depression and somewhat ties it all together. This is was no mean feat.<br />  He leaned towards Government,Big Business ,Politics , Unions and other Organizations and shows how they were the source of the problems and in the final analysis had to be the solution. It was not the honest,hard working ,good,trusting majority of the people who suffered so much,that brought on this mess and they were sure helpless to correct it.As a matter of fact most of the systems prevented them by law and control from doing so.<br />  Watkins gives most of the credit of getting things turned around to FDR and there is no doubt that he had to fight everyone to do it;in many cases his own party.This has often been the case in America from the times of Washington to Bush of today.Often the President stands alone and as Truman said \\"The buck stops here!\\" The great presidents had what it took to deal with the challenges of their times.The less great did not.<br />  America was flat on its back and pulled itself up by its bootstraps without the help of any other country.In only a few years became strong enough to lead the charge to defeat the enemies in WWII.<br />  The Commander of the Japanese Fleet that led the Surprise Attack on Pearl Harbor said it all..\\"I fear all we have managed to do is to wake a sleeping giant.\\" How right he was!<br />  The book is well researched,well written,well organized with many excellent photographs.On top of that, it is easy reading--for a History book.ll..\\"I fear all we have managed to do is to wake a sleeping giant.\\" How right he was!<BR>  The book is well researched,well written,well organized with many excellent photographs.On top of that, it is easy reading--for a History book.	2004-02-12

I've read all of Roddy Doyle's books,and no doubt about it,this one is totally different.<br />  This is not a book about Roddy,as a matter of fact it is not really a book by Roddy at all.<br />  This is a book by Rory and Ita Doyle and about their lives and the lives of their parents,grandparents,families and friends.Not only it is written through their eyes and by them,Roddy is hardly even mentioned .His only involvement would seem to have been the catalyst between his parents and the publishers to make the book happen.<br />  Having said that,I found it a very well written and interesting read.It beautifully desceibes the lives,hopes,trials,tribulations,joys,sadness,struggles,family relations,friends,working,religious and all the other things involved in living in Ireland;during most of the 20th.Century.<br />  In many ways it was not all that different where I grew up in Nova Scotia,where many were of Irish and Scottish descent.<br />In both places,as well as the rest of Europe and America,things were tough,jobs were hard to find,money was tight,but people survived,and in many ways were just as happy as today.<br />  My parents were born about 20 years earlier than Rory and Ita, and went through much the same things that they did working,creating a home and raising a family.I suppose that the biggest difference was that WW1 and WW2 affected things much differently here and The War of Independence certainly had profound effects there.But, inspite of those events ,life went on.<br />  Therefore;as a book that describes the way life went on throughout the 20th Century for a middle class family in Ireland,it is excellent.Wouldn't every family love to have one?It seems to me it would be a much more treasured heirloom than Great Grandmothers drop-leaf table.	2004-02-07

Other than &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;,I can't remember reading anything else about Wales.Though I have read extensively about mid-19 th century struggles in Ireland , Canada ,other parts of the British Empire,and the US.However,often wondered what went on in Wales during the Irish Famine and the Civil War in the US. Well,this novel gives an excellent idea of the struggles the Welsh people went through fighting the injustices and greed laid on them by the upper classes and absentee landlords.As in other countries, when the wealthy used the system to put down the common people ,it was necessary to take the law into their own hands,and at a terrible price,to obtain justice.In Wales ,tollroads were set up to squeeze unfair money from the many by the few.As in other similar situations ,rather than be subjected to these injustices the people fought back against their oppressors and the government.Many died,were imprisoned,exiled,shot indiscriminately and even fled for their lives,many to North America.<br />  Cordell is a good writer and keeps the story moving,but it is a bit difficult when he uses words and expressions one is not familiar with in North America.<br />  This book is part two of a trilogy,part one being &quot;Rape of the Fair Country&quot; and part three is &quot;Song of the Earth&quot;<br />  I did not read part one and found that part two stands by itself pretty well;but plan to read the rest of the trilogy.<br />  In many ways this book reminded me of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; by Mitchell and &quot;The Great Hunger&quot; by Cecil Woodham -Smith.	2004-01-31

The only quotation book I've seen that is limited to Curmudgeons and it stays fairly true to its theme.It shows what a mean spirited and miserable bunch most curmudgeons are.They are more to be laughed at than laughed with. Most seem to have a very negative existance and it would be hard to imagine spending much time with any of them.How could you find them likeable when they don't even like themselves;but that would suit them just fine.If you are looking for wit,humor and great observations on life in general,you'll find this book lacking;except possibly the quotes from Twain.However,if you like self-centered satire emanating from a deep seated bitterness and loneliness ,then this is for you.<br />  Webster defines a curmudgeon as &quot;a bad tempered,churlish man.&quot;<br />Many of the characters quoted don't fit that definition and certainly it doesn't fit females.Example..&quot;one more drink and I'll be under the host.&quot;..Dorothy Parker.How is that a quip from a curmudgeon?<br />  The interviews were a bit of a drag and a better effort would have been to give a short note on each quoted,especially the less known names;and an index by author.<br />  I have rated this book on how well the compiler completed what he set out to do.	2004-01-27

This is the first thing I've read by Spence.To my great surprise it is one of the best novels I've ever read.I won't try to write a precis of the book,but will try to show why I liked it so much.Being an engineer,I like to analyse things, to see how and why they work;therefore not too attracted to who-done-its,fantasy,science fiction,etc.My favorite writers are Steinbeck,Erskine Caldwell,MCMurtry etc. who describe how things were and what was behind it all.That is the kind of book this is.<br />  I grew up in a small town about the same size as Twin Buffs and know that it is the deep seated ideas of people that control the events that take place;both good and bad.<br />  Spence brings to this novel a lifetime of living and working in this part of the country and particularly his knowledge and experience with the justice system and how it affects the Native Peoples.I have read a lot of books dealing with crime and justice as well as many about the people who have been pushed aside in society,but none that get to the root of these problems like Spence does.<br />  Spence shows how injustice and prejudice is the root cause.As with Steinbeck and the migrants of the West,Caldwell with the racism and poverty of the Deep South;Spence shows the same thing with the Native Peoples of the West.<br />  Can the deep seated ideas that have motivated people for many generations not be expected to influence them when they try to deal with situations that arise in their daily lives? To people who have been raised with Judaic-Christian values,Spence has shown what the Spirituality of the Native Peoples means.<br />  As to the style of Spence's writing,I really enjoy his short chappters,46 in all,less than 10 pages per chapter.The other thing he does superbly is to almost instantly wrap things up.For example ;the end of the trial and verdict (two sentences at top of page 335,hard cover edition).Every word is important,well chosen and it never bogs down.This must be from his experience as a trial lawyer. His character development is so good that you feel you know each one and what makes them think.<br />  Spence gives us some very profound thoughts,concisely expressed:<br />  In small towns,when something is not talked about..<br />&quot;-not lost from the minds of the people,but edited from their tongues.&quot;<br />&quot;It's a waste of time,cottonwood tree.Do not be so foolish as to bud.&quot;<br />&quot;The coyote was not evil.The coyote was merely the coyote,also trapped in the system&quot;.<br />&quot;If the Judges sought justice,they would convict the system,not the victims of the system.&quot;<br />&quot;They cannot imprison me where I do not wish to be.&quot;<br />&quot;The moons come and the moons go.The stars empty themselves and fill once more.Time is for white men.Time is their devil.The Araphoe knows no such devil.&quot;<br />  For anyone who works in or deals with the justice system ,this book should be required reading.I couldn't imagine one that could give one more to think about.Not only that,anyone who wonders why people have so much trouble trying to live in peace,respect and harmony,would do well by reading this book.<br />  Half-Moon and Empty Stars is a great novel,but it is much more than that.Spence is an excellent writer and well worth reading.I plan to read more of his works.<br />  &quot;Yon-ka-tore&quot;<br />'l lawyer.

As far as a book on wit goes,this is as good as they get.What I liked best was that this book was by someone who spent his life as a fan,observer,practitioner and most of all a student of humor.This book consists almost entirely of very short pieces of wit;often referred to as one-liners.Rosten has done a good job of explaining all the various forms of 'short' wit;such as,malapropisms,neologisms,epigrams,images,observations,gags,sparkling descriptions ,soleolecisms,wisecracks,typos,transpositions,and so forth.A lot of the comments he makes are as good as the jokes he has included.Make no mistake about it,Rosten was Jewish and he weighs the book heavily with Jewish humor.I was surprised that he did not include anything by Myron Cohen as  he was one of my favorites;although I'm not positive and could have missed any.This book is almost an encyclopedia of wit and extremely well arranged in about 300 categories.However,the book would have benefited with an index by 'author'.He addressed the problem of attributions,but I still felt that it would improve the book and is usually done in most books of this type.Maybe he had more fun hanging out with Dorothy Parker than preparing indexes,and for that who could blame him?<br />  We have all heard of the line \\"He was a legend in his own mind\\" I think Rosten was a bit of \\"A wit in his own mind\\" .I think he quoted himself more than anyone else and that includes the likes of Twain,Wilde,Fields,etc. While a lot of his quotes seemed lacking when sandwiched between the masters ;he had a really good one with \\"If a picture is worth a thousand words,please paint me the Gettysburg Address\\" -one of the best!	2004-01-17

He has done a good job of categorizing all the things that effect civilization on the planet.As with most of these types of books we are shown that most trends have come out of nowhere and completely unforseen and unpredicted.Of course; there has always been struggles between peoples,natural disasters,major outbreaks of diseases,financial upheavels,conflicts among religions and political ideologies,rich and poor,elimination of resources and species,and on and on.At any point in history when one stops and looks back one sees a string of major events causing great turmoil at the time but as time goes on they all get consumed in the process and progress.However;looking forward always tends to make one think that we have been lucky so far ;but all indicators are pointing at the future as being on a direct path to disaster.Nobody knows what the future will bring ,but if we have to guess,it must be bad.Normally, predictions in books like this are so vague that no matter what the future brings it can be construed to fit the prediction. The other approach is to make the prediction so far in the future that nobody remembers it.A case in point; that the limiting factor for the number of vehicles would be that there was only enough rubber trees to make so many tires,..guess what, we learned to make synthetic tires which ended up better and cheaper.<br />  It's tough enough to predict the near (a couple of years)future, but when it comes to several decades--it' fun to fantasize,but don't take it seriously.<br />  The author thought he would try anyway.So,remember now, he wrote this book in 1998.He came up with the idea of  terrorists exploding a home made fifteen-kiloton nuclear device on the outskirts of Las Vegas killing 8000 people in 2006.This caused a crisis that wrecked all the world economies for years to come.<br />  Lo and behold in 2001, just 3,not 8 years;such an event ,9/11 happened and the world's financial systems didn't crumble.It just shows the resiliance of mankind.<br />  Anyway,Linden has really detailed the issues ahead,but the future remains to be seen.A good read nonetheless.Maybe one should put it away for someone to read in 2050;and I doubt that he'll be off in the wilderness ,dressed in a robe,tending his little herd of sheep,on his little self-sufficient family farm.That is, unless that is where he is ,and what he is doing now.e world's financial systems didn't crumble.It just shows the resiliance of mankind.<BR>  Anyway,Linden has really detailed the issues ahead,but the future remains to be seen.A good read nonetheless.Maybe one should put it away for someone to read in 2050;and I doubt that he'll be off in the wilderness ,dressed in a robe,tending his little herd of sheep,on his little self-sufficient family farm.That is, unless that is where he is ,and what he is doing now.	2004-01-09

I have been solving Tangrams for over 50 years and have amassed a modest collection of Tangrams and books about Tangrams.However,until I found this book,I didn't realize how little I knew about them or how modest my little collection was.Up till now I thought the Penguin publication of Joost Elffers book including 1600 puzzles,plus the packaged set published by Stewart,Tabori &amp; Chang in 1997; the Dover publication of Ronald Read's ;as well as the beautifully packaged sets by Crawford were about all that could be done on the subject.<br />  Not so; Slocum has produced a magnificent book and has created the new definitive book on Tangrams.<br />  I used to think there might be as many as 3000 possible problems.Slocum informs that Harold Raizer studied 104 books and card sets and of the more than 20,000 problems found 5900 different problems published before 1926.<br />  Slocum has covered all the history and separated  fact from fiction.He has reviewed all the major publications produced worldwide and included many photographs that nobody could possibly see without visiting museums and private collections around the world.His Bibliography and References is simply amazing with about 250 entries.<br />  On top of that he has given us 1756 problems to work on as well as providing the solutions.Even here ,he hs done a superb job of selecting these promlems from the landmark books published over the years.<br />  The high quality of the printing,color rendering and overall construction mirrors the high quality of the content of the book.<br />  The title &quot;The Tangram Book&quot; tells it all;that's what this book will become.<br />  On behalf of Puzzle lovers,and particulary Tangram lovers,I would like to congratulate Jerry Slocum and Sterling on their brilliant effort.	2004-01-06

The author seems to have set out to show that throughout history the source of wars has been inherent in the participants on both sides .He has in no way proven that to be the case.He ignores the evil people and regimes that have been the source of  much of the misery,death and destruction that has occurred .Are we really expected to buy into the thinking that the people and countries that were butchered and destroyed in Europe by the Nazis and Fascists,for example, can be equated with the Allied Forces that had to fight back and destroy them?I think not!What about the the efforts now being made to hunt down the evil,misguided terrorists behind the 9\11 attacks on the Unites States?Are they operating on the same principles as those who conceived and carried out those evil deeds? I think not.<br />  History has repeatedly shown that there have always been forces of good and evil.It is not at all difficult to differentiate between them and those who fail or refuse to do so will soon regret it.Again;history has provided many lessons.<br />  I sure hope that this naive ,academic thinking is not used as a history course resource;unless it is used to demonstrate the kind of thought process that Neville Chamberlain follwed.	2003-12-24

I really enjoyed this little book.I was only 10 at the end of WW2;but remember a lot of what went on.I was growing up in Nova Scotia at the time.At school, each of us had our own personal gas mask hanging on a hook in our classroom.We had drills and everyone got into their masks.I shudder to think what an outcry would be made today if such a program was instituted.Everyone just got on board and no,the kids didn't have physiological problems or nightmares.We all brought anything made of aluminium to school and threw it at effigies of Hitler and Togo hanging from trees.After; the pots ,pans, etc were collected up and sent off to be mented down to use in making airplanes to help beat the enemy.Unlike today;there was no doubt by anyone who the enemy was.Every kid in the class brought their quarter to school to buy War Savings Stamps.At home, in the evenings, there would be Air Raid Blackout Drills.I lived in a town with a nearby Army Camp,an Airforce Base about 30 miles away in one direction and several Navy Baseswithin less than 80 miles.Needless to say,there were military personnel everywhere and Troop Trains with windows covered passing through our town.Airplanes were seen daily practicing manouvers overhead and endless army vehicles going through town.I even remember sitting on my steps and hearing the Army firing big guns only a few miles away.On Saturday afternoons we went to the movies and watched the newsreels showing the real war.Was it scarry being a kid at that time?No,not that I remember,we all believed we were going to win in the end.Thanks to the author for bringing back a lot of those memories at the beginning of this book.<br />  As the years went on, I spent quite a few years in the Army Cadets,Militia the Officer Training Corps;fortunately none of it in active warfare.<br />  However;the humor Osgood brings to us reminded me of the humor that sustains one whenever involved in military life.Without humor, a sane person would be driven to madness;and this would be particularly true in wartime. Humor,trickery,cunning,subterfuge,chicanery,deception,circumvention,friendships,loyalty,and most of all,living by one's wit are all important in any area of life;but in the military are practiced as a fine art.<br />  It was also good to see the Bill Mauldin's drawings again.They brought to me two other good books that anyone who liked \\"Kilroy Was Here\\";should also enjoy namely;\\"The Brass Ring\\" and \\"Up Front\\", both by Mauldin.<br />  I highly recommend it to anyone who has spent any time in the military.To someone who has not,they probably wouldn't believe how things were.uld be particularly true in wartime.

In dramatic times of history,be it the Wild West,WW2,Crime in Chicago etc.people are craving for an understanding of events as well entertainment,and that is what we are given by the writers and the media.<br />  Personally,I enjoy both the factual as well as the fictional<br />aspect of these times.<br /> One character who often appears in books is Ned Buntline.He was a real person by the name of Edward Zane Carroll Judson,and this book does a pretty good job of telling us who he was and some of the things he did.Somebody must have written a book on him;it would be a good read.	2003-12-17

I really believe this book fell way short of the mark.Other than taking a few snapshots with a point and shoot camera,I am not a photographer.You don't need to be an artist to enjoy art,a musician for music,a writer for literature;but when arts are well done, they should enthrall the public.While there are some of the more famous photos of the past 150 years,there are many that are just run of the mill.The book gives a history of photojournalism,it does not give the impression that the photographers have really anvanced the art.One even gets the feeling that the introduction of color has made the photographers lazy,trying to let color do the work for them rather than using it as an artistic tool.I don't really believe that is the case;it's just that the auhors haven't done that great of a job,in my estimation.With the writers  access to the photos that Time must have,I get the feeling that very little effort or ability went into this book.Let's hope someone else will give it a try and do a better job of it.	2003-12-08

It seems so ironic that these people who are adored so much by their fans actually live difficult and lonely lives.<br />  In addition to getting to know so much about Monroe;this book gives a great insight into the workings of the music business as well as the impact on all the friends, family and co- workers of the &quot;stars&quot;.<br />  I guess the most striking thing thing that I got from reading this book is that while these people sacrifice everything for their careers,we owe them so much gratitude for the enjoyment they put in our lives.<br />  The words that Bill's son James had inscribed on on his father,s monument says it all:<br />  &quot;Walk softly around this grave for my father Bill Monroe rests here as the blue moon of Kentucky shines on.&quot;	2003-12-07

I doubt if any of McMurtry's other books have left readers so divided.<br />  I happen to think this set of Berrybender Narratives will rank alongside 'Lonesome Dove' and there will be a lot of discussion as to which is best.However;these discussions will never be resolved,because two things so different just simply can't be compared.<br />  I just can't wait to read the next books in the tetralogy.	2003-11-30

This is a delightful little book.If you have any interest in Geometry,Math,Design,Shapes,Tile patterns,Puzzles,etc.you'll really enjoy this book.Surprisingly ,you can grasp most of this book knowing high school math,;while at the same time those with more math knowledge will also enjoy it as well.I guess it falls right in the realm of Mathematical Recreations.I am amazed that the author has put together a beautifully writen book,including 168 drawings,figures,diagrams and on top of that shows how most are constructed.All this has been accomplished in 64 pages ,including an introduction.	2003-11-28

Haven't read any of this conspiracy stuff for some time;so thought I'd give this book a go.Nothing has changed,just the same old rehashed babble.Take UFO's for instance,the same old stuff is still being regurgitated from what I read 30 years ago.The only things that change are the names, places and the proponents of these wacky accusations and fanatical suppositions.<br />It's amazing that they have kept this up for so long and after all this time nothing has been proven.Maybe it's another government conspiracy that keeps these writers going.It takes one to know one.<br />  They even dump on Erich von Daniken,calling him an amateur;at least I found his enjoyable supposition.This book would like you to think that they have things figured out;sprinkling words like science,research,analysis,experts, study,etc.,throughout the text in an attempt to give it some credibility.<br />  This book was published in 1998,but don't be fooled ,a lot of this stuff is just a rehash from decades ago.Just because some conspiracy theorist makes a statement,backed up by some 'expert',doesn't make it so.<br />  Maybe I'll check back in a few years,but I don't expect to find anything new.	2003-11-28

I can't believe that it's nearly 50 years since I read Kantor's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Andersonville&quot;Somehow I missed this 'what if'when it came out in LOOK magazine and book form as well as all the hoopla it created.It is a short, but enjoyable speculation.How realistic the results could be is anybody's guess.I guess it is all in where one is coming from ,but the important thing is that Kantor's version is plausible and makes for good reading.It is an art, and not a science ,to look back in history to determine what and why things happened;and when one attempts to look to the future there are no constraints at all;so,anything is fair game.<br />  Trying to speculate what would have happened if Kennedy was not killed in Dallas...heck,we're not even sure why, or even if, he was shot by Oswald.<br />  The introduction by Harry Turtledove is excellent and has some very good points to make on alternate history writings.Kantor has whet my appetite for more.I am about to start on &quot;What If&quot;, edited by Robert Cowley.I think one of the comments made about it by Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,  &quot;...history is not an inevitable march of dusty names,dates and places,but a precarious,careening ride that could have taken us to any number of destinations.&quot;<br />  I guess that about says it all.	2003-11-27

The changes that occurred in Europe in the middle of the 15th.<br />Century were monumental in the advance of civilization.This change was extremely quick;essentially taking place in only a decade or so. All the requirements were in place ,such as writing,presses inks,papers,techniques of working with metals for making type,etc.All that was missing was the will to pull all the things together to produce books using movable type instead of hand reproduction.<br />  This period was totally different from what we know today.A very few people owned and controlled everything.There were very few books,none available to anyone except the upper classes and academics.This mattered little, as few commoners read anyway.Europe was ravished by wars and every so often breakouts of the Black Death.The ruling class ,in conjunction with the Church ruled and controlled everything.Gutenberg's introduction of movable type printing provided the vehicle that changed all that.<br />  More than just dealing with printing, this book is excellent in describing how society operated and how changes in printing on a mass scale, effected changes that resulted in society being turned upside down forever.It took something like this to advance out of the Middle Ages;just like it took electricity to create the Industrial Age.<br />  What I found so good about this book is that ,unlike most history books that describe what happened,this author shows why these things happened.<br />  The author has dealt with all this in a very readible manner.	2003-11-25

I'm not sure why,but this book has a lot more to it than first meets the eye.Often books of this nature are of the 'edited 'type with very little effort put into them and while the concept is good ;usually filled with a bunch of fluff.But not this one.A great effort has gone into it and as a result we have an excellent work.<br />  While he never gets away from his topic,Turner gives us an awful lot about the history of Newton and everyone associated with him,a thorough understanding of the slave trade,a good understanding of the various Protestant churches of the18th and 19th centuries .If that isn't enough, he has covered in minute detail the evolution of the hymn,it's meaning word by word,it's associated music and how it spread ,and by whom ,throughout it's 225 year history.<br />  He has beautifully shown the deep religious and theological meaning the hymn has for those who understand it and have a faith in God.He has just as well explained how and why so many people love and get inspiration from the hymn even though they may have little in the way of faith or religious involvement.He does this without being judgemental in any way.<br />  As to how Newton could be involved in the slave trade..&quot;Slavery was as acceptable as abortion is today-it was legal,it had immediate and tangible benefits,and people predicted widespread calamity should it ever be banned.There was no social pressure for him to feel shame.Cities had been built on the fruits of slavery and the great merchants of slaves were celebrated,giving their names to buildings and streets.It was those who were opposed to slavery who were regarded as irritants-ememies of social stability,troublemakers,idealists with no concern for progress.&quot;<br />  There is one thing I would like to add and that is..If there ever was a book that would have benefited from an included CD,this would have been it.	2003-11-21

Just finished this delightful book.This short book gives a good description of Irish culture.In rating this book I gave it 3 stars so how come 5;I'll explain later.The book covers all aspects of the Irish,such as :politics,court,war,faith and clergy,love and marriage,food and drink,death ,repartee,country life,traditional remedies,charms,superstitions,blessings and curses and songs.That is pretty well the whole shebang;and believe it or not, it's done in the lighthearted manner that only an Irishman born in County Mayo and living in Dublin could do it.<br />  Now, you might wonder how one could deal with death in a lighthearted manner;let me give an example:<br />  &quot;When the famous Irish clown Johnny Patterson was on his deathbed,the doctor tried to appear optomistic by leaving quickly with a cheerful'I'll see you in the morning,Johnny'.<br />  'Sure you will,doc,'said the clown.'But will I see you?'<br />  And how's this for repartee?<br />  When Brendan Behan was at the height of his fame,a man went up to him in a Dublin bar and asked him for the loan of 5 pounds.When Brendan refused,the man became haughty.'I can remember the time when you had nothing.'<br />  'That may be',said Behan,'but you don't remember it half as well as I do.'<br />  Or how about this one:<br />  &quot;No man is rich enough to buy back his past&quot;<br />  When it comes to curses ,how's this?<br />  &quot;May You be hanged&quot; is a curse for which there are several euphemistic Irish versions.One alluding to the victim's kicking heels,is &quot;May you die dancing&quot;.Another,inspired by the inevitable crowd of spectators and the coffin waiting below the scaffold, is &quot;May you live to see your own funeral&quot;.<br />  While the Irish are good with curses,they are even better with blessings:<br />  &quot;Good health and long life to you,<br />  The woman of your choice to you,<br />  Land without rent to you,<br />  And may you die in Ireland.&quot;<br /><br />  That's just a taste of the book;there's  191 pages just as good.<br />  Now, back to the stars.I also gave the book 2 stars for the beautiful illustrations by Robert Gibbings that are scattered throughout.There's not just a dozen or so,which in itself would be great, but unbelievably ,no less than 131 of them.<br />  Overall a wonderful book, and definitely...<br />  A TOUCH OF THE IRISH !!<br />thrges just as good.<BR>  Now, back to the stars.I also gave the book 2 stars for the beautiful illustrations by Robert Gibbings that are scattered throughout.There's not just a dozen or so,which in itself would be great, but unbelievably ,no less than 131 of them.<BR>  Overall a wonderful book, and definitely...<br />   A TOUCH OF THE IRISH !! <BR>thr	2003-11-18

This is an excellent book.If you are looking to buy a bird guide for yourself or as a gift, you can't go wrong with this.The problem of buying a bird guide is that there are so many to choose from;especially if the buyer has not been birding for several years.Personally,I would recommend this for a fairly new birder as opposed to Peterson's guide for one reason alone.this book covers all of North America.Peterson has one for the East and one for the West;and while if you only want your guide to use in either the East or West,that's not too bad,but if you are in the center of the continent, or plan to travel,you'll need both.So,simple ,why buy 2 when 1 will do?The Golden covers all N,A. but does not have the &quot;arrows&quot; pointing out the best identification features.I also feel the computer enhanced pictures are better;but that can be a matter of preference.The single page index at the back of Kenn's book will be a big help to new or average birders.Either of Kaufman,s Peterson,s or Golden are excellent to start birding.The National Geographic and Sibleys are also excellent;but a better choice for a more experienced (5+ years).Up until Kaufman's book,very few birders liked photographs ,as opposed to drawings,but this book has changed all that.<br />  After saying all that,and it would be easy to go on comparing these guides,in the final analiyis ,you can't go too far wrong.If you or the person you are buying the book for takes birding serious you'll probably buy all the guides mentioned before too long.There are good points going for all of them.	2003-11-18

Suffice it to say ,anyone with any interest in nature,birds, extinct species,conservation,preservation of species,would find this an excellent read.As a matter of fact,I would go so far as to suggest that after reading this book,one would probably agree it is the best natural history book they have ever read.Just look at the other reviews.<br /><br />The main reason for my writing this review is to tell you that after reading 'The Last of the Curlews'you might want to read some of Bodsworth's other lesser known but also excellent works.<br /><br />\\"The Strange One\\"<br /><br />\\"The Sparrows Fall\\"<br /><br />\\"The Atonement of Ashley Morden\\"<br /><br />and,<br /><br />\\"The Pacific Coast\\"<br /><br />Another excellent thing about 'The Last of the Curlews' are the superb scratch board illustrations by T M Shortt,one of Canada's finest artists;so make sure they are in the edition you get.<br /><br />With regards to my title...for several decades the search has continued without success.There have been a few reports of sightings,but none confirmed.There is a lot of territory in it's range,between the tip of South America and the Arctic Circle where there may be survivors...there's always hope.<br /><br />I still see Fred on occasion;so let's hope we see another book from him soon.	2003-11-16

I picked this book up on the strength of the remarks on the back cover. I enjoy off-the-wall humor and especially word play,puns and interesting characters.Before I started to read the book,I glanced at the Customer Reviews and was really anxious to get at it,expecting a great read by a highly touted author, who was new to me.<br />  Man,what a disappointment.I plodded through to page 137 and gave up.All we got was a bunch of uninteresting losers going aimlessly about their mundane lives.There was nothing about any character that made you want to read more.As for humor;a little 3-year old spouting foul language hardly qualifies. This may seem humorous to linguists,but I can't imagine it would tickle too many funny bones.Once again,I thought I would skip to the last few pages,it didn't get any better.At that point ,I was glad I quit when I did.<br />  So, why did others think the book so good? I have no idea.I returned to the Customer Reviews,intending to check out a few (see more about me)'s and Lo! and Behold,of the 6 reviewers ,there were none. I asked myself, who I knew might enjoy this book,but couldn't think of anyone.Then a light flashed!I checked to see who published the book.Oh! Oh! there it was &quot;Work on this novel was supported by a Fellowship from the University of Missouri Wendon Spring Fund.&quot;.I usually check for this sort of thing first,as I rarely find books that get written and published using the crutch of a grant,to be very good.I guess these groupes who give these grants look down on the 'trash' that is put out by the authors and publishers who must earn their keep,and want produce their own for themselves.	2003-11-14

I did not intend to suggest I knew Erdos,I was just thinking that every once in a while a genius does appear and walks amongst we less gifted mortals.Although I've studied a lot of mathematics;but when one reads about Erdos,one feels like a baseball fan,who has not even played minor league ball,getting to see how a Major Leaguer ,and one of the best at that,thinks.<br />  If you would like to read about a man whose life in Mathematics was similar to Woody Guthrie's in music you will find this an excellent read.To enjoy this book you no more need to know mathematics any more than you need to read or compose music to enjoy reading about the life of Guthrie.<br />  Erdos,who put in 19-hour days proving and conjecturing,denied that he fell asleep during mathematics conferences.&quot;I wasn't sleeping&quot;,he would say.&quot;I was thinking.&quot;<br />The book also tells us about Erdos's great friend,Ron Graham.They were referred to as the odd couple of mathematics; but so different from one another.Erdos never had a job that lasted more than an acedemic year;Graham would stay at Bell Labs his whole career,eventually becoming Chief Scientist.Graham had a complete family life ;Erdos had no family.Erdos became addicted to amphetamines.Graham bet him he couldn't quit.Erdos won and kept off drugs for a month and said &quot;But I didn't get any work done.I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper.I'd have no ideas,just like an ordinary person.You set mathematics back a month&quot;.	2003-11-14

An excellent book by an excellent writer!McCourt has awaken the intrest in all of us to get to the bottom of what this song is all about.I think he has done it, and each time I hear it ,I will think of this book,and of what the song means to me.<br />  Though there are numerous ideas about what the song means,who was it to and from etc.,he has shown that doesn't really matter.It is a song expressing deep love,and it can mean whatever the listener wants it to mean.I have dozens of versions and although they vary greatly I love them all.I am always happy to hear it by another singer whether a professional or just an ordinary person singing from the heart.<br />  As to whether or not the words were written in Ireland by an Irishman;it doesn't matter in the least,it's a great Irish song.<br />When you stop and think about it,there's no way it could be anything else but Irish.Johnny Cash wrote &quot;Forty Shades of Green&quot; as he was flying over Ireland,a school teacher living in Ontario wrote &quot;Maggie&quot; to his lover,and if that isn't enough, the song &quot;I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen&quot; was written in America and had nothing at all to do with taking Kathleen back to Ireland,because she didn't come from there in the first place.<br />  However;all these songs are Irish .What you have to remember is that there over 50 million Irish dispersed all over the world including about 4 million in Ireland.This book would be a great gift for anyone  with a song  in their heart and a twinkle in their eye for there's sure to be some Irish in their blood.	2003-11-14

This book was published in 1993 and is still available.It is a wonderful 'little' book which lives up to its billing of being Hank's complete lyrics.There may have been a few found since the publication;but it contains the complete words to 130 songs.It would be a treasure to any Hank fan;in fact,no fan should be without it.The setup of the book is impressive in that the songs are organized by the first word in the song's title.ie.,'I Saw the Light' is followed by 'I Told A Lie To My Heart'.It just couldn't be simpler. I find it great to play Hank's songs and follow along with him.Even if you can't sing;crank up the volume,and let 'er rip;Hank will enjoy your accompaniment.<br />  In addition to the songs, Cusic opens the book with 16 pages of Hank's life and lots of information on how he wrote these songs and who he collaborated with and so on.<br />  He also includes a lot of information on books on Hank and other sources of info on country music.In his section 'Permissions' ,he gives the dates the songs were copyrighted and who jointly wrote some of the songs with Hank.<br />  Cusic sums it up with this comment.<br />  &quot;Hank and his songs remain easy to understand,but their effect eludes explanation,and defies duplication.They are the essence of country music.&quot;<br />  You said it,Don; and thanks for a great book.	2003-11-13

If you have been a long time fan of POGO or just finding it for the first time ;you will find this a wonderful book.It is a good resource covering a bit of everything about the strip as well as Walt Kelly.The great age of comics spanned about 4 decades,in my opinion,from the 30's to the 70's.There is nothing scientific about my defining either what were the comics or when they started.I was born in the mid-thirties;so found those strips in full blossom when I started to read.Through that period virtually everyone ,from kids to seniors,read the comics and even those who didn't would have known about the characters and goings on.This all sort of petered out in the late 60's and early 70's.<br />Just to call to mind a few of my favorites:Dick Tracy,Little Orphan Annie,Li'L Abner.Donald Duck,Flash,Terry and the Pirates,Prince Valiant,Popeye, Gordon,Superman,Blondie,and of course POGO.<br /> It is a real treat to find a book like this one to bring back old memories and hours of enjoyment.The comic sections are now but a shadow of the past and about all I follow today is Doonsbury.<br />  I may sound a little sad as I write this review,I guess that can be attributed to the reports Of the death of Art Carney coming through as I write this.<br />  Maybe that was one of the best things about strips like POGO;you never got the blues reading him.<br />  A little more light-hearted humor would do us all some good.	2003-11-12

True Crime has always interested me;particulayly what made these criminals tick.There,s lots of speculation about their thinking;but never many resolutions;particularly with the loners.This book was very disapointing.the text was very poor,disjointed and difficult in connecting with the photos.If this book shows anything,it is that the photography was much better in the past than recent times.Sure, there was some pretty gruesome stuff,but there is more to the art of crime photography than presented in this book.Before buying ,I would suggest giving it a pretty good look over.I was quite surprised by the high reviews this book received;however,considering the background of the authors;maybe it is a better book for the insiders of crime photography.But then,who do they do this work for,themselves or others? the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words doesn't hold here.Most shots are like snapshots taken by amateurs who just happen to be passing and took a shot.	2003-11-10

I have been a fan of Caldwell's since I first read one of his novels way back in the early 50's;that probably being &quot;Tobacco Road or &quot;God's Little Acre&quot;;written in 1932 and 1933 respectively.He was a prolific writer for around 50 years, easily rivalling the most popular writers of his time.His works of over 50 novels and large numbers of short stories covered the way of life of people all over America and even Russia during WW2.While others wrote about middle class and upper class ,he wrote about the poor,disinfrancised end of society;much as did Steinbeck.A couple of years ago I went looking for some of his other novels.I couldn't believe it,they are very hard to find.Most used bookstores,don't seem to know about him;if you are lucky ,if they can come up with the two books I mentioned;but what is more likely is they reply &quot;Oh,you must mean Taylor Caldwell,let me help you.&quot;--yeah!I have manged to turn up most of his works and read  and enjoyed them.I live in Canada and it seems that his name and work has become politically incorrect;I can't say what the case is in the US.<br />  Anyway;be that be as it may,I found this Autobiography very good and told me a lot about him and his work.<br />  I would think ,what the politically correct of today think,could concern him less were he alive today.<br />  If you like Caldwell (and I don't mean Taylor),you should enjoy this book,which includes a listing of his work.	2003-11-08

It affected everything,how medical practioners were helpless,lawlessness,morality ,witchcraft,religion,family life cannabilism,persecution of others,children,music and dance;and<br />then after it had run it's course an explosive recovery occurred.The population increased rapidly,music and dance exploded,clothes became colorful,elaborate hair styles were everywhere and life became victorious again.This rapid recovery bore testimony to the indestructibility of the human race.Believe it or not;no matter how far humanity descends,there's always a light at the end of the tunnel.	2003-11-05

Thes is a very interesting story.It is well written and well researched.It was also done by Rudy Weibe and Thomas P.Kelley.<br />  Kelley also wrote &quot;the Black Donnellys&quot;.His style was much different;more along the lines of a Pulp fiction writer;where the story is essentially the same,but greatly embellished with fictional conversation,descriptions of events and details whenever needed to tell the story as excitedly as possible.<br />  In Johnson's Case, he had every right to refuse entry to someone without a warrant.It may not have been smart on his part,and no doubt really  angered the law.So on the return visit the law was going to get him regardless;blow him away if necessary (they were armed and equipped with explosives to do it).What Johnson's mental state was ,who knows,except those who came to get him;and they tried.Don't forget they really had nothing on him at this point except their pride was damaged because of his resisting. What really happened ;there,s only their side of the story. At this point Johnson was in a no win situation and the law knew it,and so did he.I remind you again,the law was in total control when they set off this chain of events.<br />  In the case of the Black Donnellys ;they opened their door to the demand of a constable and posse and 4 defenseless people were murdered and their home burned down on top of them.<br />  These are two very sad stories in Canadian history ;neither one resolved,but both deserve to be known.<br />  Without books like these, stories like these, would be swept under the carpet.<br />  This is real history;not the stuff about trappers exploring a river in a canoe and asking students what they were called.<br />  This brings to mind what a War Correspondant once said;<br />  &quot;Don't believe a politician or anyone in uniform.&quot;	2003-11-04

I hope not,but I am sure it will.In only 2 short years it seems that many have already started to replace the horror and shock with political rhetoric.It is easy to identify them as they usually start off with ..\\"It was an awful thing,but...\\" You fill in the blanks.With an act like this;there are no buts ! ! !<br /> An excellent book,as is \\"One Nation \\";and will be worth looking at many times as the War on Terror proceeds.	2003-10-18

He did it all ,and in a large degree,by himself. In any area ,be it: songwriting,costumes,variety,gospel,heartbreak,lonlieness,love,inovation,tours,fighting the establishnent,personal life,longevity,an interresting personality,pop ularity,humility,you name it, he excelled and was the one who set the standard for the other stars to follow.I am sure most of them would agree.<br />  If my memory serves me well ,Hank had several songs on the top 10 a year after his death; and we still see books like these coming out 50 years after his death. One can only imagine what he would have produced if he had lived a normal lifespan.<br />  This book is excellent in every respect and also a great companion to Escott's other equally fine effort Hank Williams S - The Biography.If my memory serves me correctly,Hank had several songs in thev top 10 a year after his death and book of this quality still coming out 50 years after his death.	2003-10-14

One reviewer suggested that Kennedy was in a class with Steinbeck and one day might even win a Pulitzer,I hope he's right.Steinbeck is one of my favorites but I am sure not to everyone's liking.By the way I read Riding the Yellow Trolly Car and didn't care for it either.However;that's me ,give it a go,others really liked it.	2003-10-14

What a crazy mixed up pile of stuff! I like Westerns,Ripley's Believe it or Not!,truth is stranger than fiction stuff,unusual characters,history,oddities,greatly miss the old freak shows that travelled with the carnivals,real life outlaws,and you name it.History is full of this stuff and to me much more fun to delve into than fiction.While the author didn't seem to come up with too much on old Elmer;probably because his short and non-illustrious produced very little;he sure found enough to spin around what he did have to create a good interresting read.I believe the period after the Civil War until the start of the 2WW produced some of the most interresting characters and times in American history.That was all before the do gooders, politically correct,boring and otherwise anal-retentive got everything under control.But then again, they probably prefer  reading about some corporate business scam to the gangster days of Capone and all. Since this was the first thing I've read by the author I'll be looking to find something else from him.From what he did with this story I am sure he'll be giving us some more good stuff in the future.	2003-10-13

This book says nothing more than what has been known as long as man has been civilized.Trying to relate everything to some ism,karma,mantra,location of the planets or stars,numerology or New Age has been attempted for time immemorial.Although I have never paid much attention to physics or astrologers,as they never seem to predict anything but the obvious or after the fact,and are great with lingo categorizing everything into a neat little package,I thought I'd give this book a go anyway.<br />  I found nothing new in the book and everything was summed up in the last chapter of self evident truths,which the author basically admits in the end.These truths have been developed throughout the ages and have changed little, if at all.An ideal world where everything and everybody follows these truths is something else and that is why civilizations have had all their trials and tribulations.Perfect little worlds,of communes living in seclusion,meditation and perfection are fine;but to think that all of civilization will live that way is simply not realistic;and could be referred to only as heaven on earth.<br />  In this new millennium,as in the past,change is the only thing that will be constant,and if an author were to address this subject 500 years from now,the keys will remain the same as they were 500 years ago.<br />  Maybe that's all the author is really trying to tell us; follow the truths(keys),and forget all that psychic,astrology,isms and New Age stuff.	2003-10-10

Although I read a lot I tend to shy away from pure fiction as I find real life more to my liking.Just because a book is an award winner and particularly if it owes its existance to some grant doesn't mean it's for everyone.I found this a real gem.I had a little trouble trying to decide what I really thought of it.To start with I grew up in the center of Nova Scotia ,as opposed to Cape Breton.My ancestery is both Scottish and Irish as well as Catholic and Protestant.I went to &quot;X&quot; as did the author and lived among the Celtic descendents of Maritimers be they from NFLD,NB,PEI and NS.I am very familiar with the locations,highways,and experiences throughout the book;right down to the tavern beneath the Lord Nelson where we Engineers from &quot;Tech&quot; enjoyed a few cool ones.As with the author most of us left home and settled in Quebec,Ontario as well as scattering all over North America,mainly in the search of jobs.This was the<br />same as for our ancestors from Scotland and Ireland.While many<br /> left,many stayed behind.In fact the population of the Maritimes is still about the same  it was 150 years ago.What this novel  does is describe the way of life,hopes, fears,love,family,and trials and tribulations of a people and their life.This same has happened throughout history;and similar to what Steinbeck wrote about in The Grapes of Wrath.I am not surprised that some readers find this somewhat dull or boring and even though they lived through it; would just as soon leave it all behind.The only thing I found somewhat lacking was any reference to faith or religion ,a central component to the life of these<br />people.	2003-10-06

I have read and &quot;studied&quot; several of Mr.Kunstler's books and enjoyed them all.I particularly enjoy the artists comments as to why he does some of the things the way he does.This book is different in that his art is not accompanied by his explanations but by another writer's text.This text is very good and really brings out the personalities of these great characters.As one who believes that it is important to understand the personalities of the people involved if one is to understand why things happened the way they did;this is very well done.<br />As to the title of my review;I find eyes fascinating.The first thing I look at in Mr.Kunstler's paintings is the eyes.Let me point out Confederate Sunset on pg.56 both Lee's and Jackson's eyes are very beady and staring resulting in them looking like figures in a wax museum;giving the painting a posed and unnatural feeling.Other examples are of Jackson on pages 38and 40.Note the difference in Jackson's eyes on page44.Another thing I like to study is how some paintings look very stiff,posed almost like a diorama in a museum,eg.The Return of Stuart on pg.126.Compare this to The Last Council on pg.102 which is so realistic. Am I alone in seeing this aspect of Mr.Kunstler's work?	2003-09-02

Very poor piece of work;even for what I call an &quot;edited book&quot;.<br />Most quotations have nothing to do with the concept [title]of excellence.There is no rational order,theme,chronology,reason for selected quotes or even an index.For instance;if one wanted to see what J.C.Adams had to say about EXCELLENCE,you'd have to thumb through the book page by page till you come to page 42 where you find &quot;Duty is ours;results are God,s.&quot;.What's this got to do with excellence,or even inspiration as suggested on the cover? If these quotes had been thrown together in an evening by a school student ;the effort would recieve only mediocre marks.So,how did it ever get published?I guess what it takes is being vice president of the  publishing company.Generally speaking I find &quot;edited books &quot; are poor efforts;but this one takes the prize!	2003-08-11
