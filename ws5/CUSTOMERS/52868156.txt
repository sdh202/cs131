Almost alone at a retreat in North Carolina, one week has stretched into three, but the real world is calling again and they must reluctantly part ways.<br /><br />Just as they reach the airport, Callie gets a phone call from Stella Gold.  Her husband Eli has just been shot by a sniper and is in surgery.  Before loosing consciousness, he specifically asked for the two of them to come.  Since Eli is such a good friend, they drop everything and rush to his bed side.<br /><br />A PI, Callie wants to figure out what happened to Eli.  The only clue is a warning from someone named Nadine.  When Eli and Stella's condo is searched, it is further proof that someone is after him.  Where might he have hidden his notes?  And why did Eli request Tom's presence?<br /><br />As this series has progressed, the plots have only gotten strong, and this book is no exception.  It starts with a bang and keeps right on going.  Every time an answer comes, it only leaves more questions.  Yet Callie and Tom keep digging, getting themselves further and further in trouble.  While some things seemed obvious a little early on, there are still several nice twists along the way that keep the reader guessing.<br /><br />Fans of the series will be happy to learn that Tom is a very active part of this book instead of only a presence like in previous entries.  In fact, we even get to learn what he does, finally.  His relationship with Callie continues to grow as she continues to move on from her husband's death.  In fact, one of the strong points of the series is watching Callie finally truly deal with her grief.<br /><br />The writing style is still a little rough, keeping the reader a little more at bay by telling instead of showing.  It's not a big problem, however, and I found myself staying up too late reading every night to see what would happen in the next chapter.<br /><br />The only problem with this book is the cliffhanger ending.  Even though I saw it coming (I've read the back of the next book already), it still left me wanting to pick up the next book right away.  Which isn't really a bad thing at all.<br /><br />With a strong plot and great characters, this Christian mystery series is wonderful entertainment.is book is the cliffhanger ending.

Fortunately, she has one possibility already lined up.  The city of Clovis wants to increase their tourism revenue and is looking for a PR consultant to help them do that.  As an added bonus, she'll get to spend time with one of her best friends, Mae King, a local dairy farmer.<br /><br />Mae is acting weird, however.  When Sasha finally gets Mae to open up, Mae reveals two secrets.  First, aliens have regularly kidnapped her.  Second, there's a dead body on her land, and she doesn't really want to call the police for fear they'll arrest her.<br /><br />Sasha isn't keen on the idea of keeping the secret and calls the police the first chance she gets.  After she does, she realizes Mae's fears were justified as she seems to be the only suspect the police want to talk about.  Mae's daughter isn't helping matters any by sticking her nose into the two's friendship.<br /><br />Meanwhile, at her interview with the Chamber of Commerce, Sasha learns they want her to come up with a PR plan to put them on the map and greatly increase their tourism revenue.  And they hint that the aliens in the area really just might be the way to go.  She's got just one week to come up with a plan to present to find out if she'll get the job.<br /><br />The book starts out all over the place, with talk of Sasha's hallucinations and a visit with her mom.  I was beginning to wonder if the praise I'd heard for the book was well founded or not, but then Sasha arrived in Clovis.  It's really not too far in, but from that point on, the plot picks up and the book becomes quite interesting.  There are several red herrings that distract for a while, but the solution is a little obvious before the end.  Even so, the author does a good job of keeping the reader entertained with quirky and sinister characters.  The writing style is quite fun as well.  There are long passages of dialog at times, and every so often, the author uses a cleaver turn of phrase that makes you stop and reread the passage to fully enjoy it.<br /><br />The couple of flaws are worth mentioning, but hardly detract from the overall enjoyment.  It's a quirky cozy that will leave the reader ready for Sasha's next case.at times, and every so often, the author uses a cleaver turn of phrase that makes you stop and reread the passage to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />The couple of flaws are worth mentioning, but hardly detract from the overall enjoyment.

Anyone who read comics strips in the 80's and 90's has one strip that always brings a smile to their face - Calvin and Hobbes.  Now, the entire too short run of this classic is collected in one classy set.<br /><br />For those not familiar, Calvin is a six year old boy growing up in a house with his parents.  His best friend is his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, who happens to be real, but only to Calvin.  Together, the two get into all kinds of scraps, mainly because Calvin is the poster child for obnoxious kids.  The fact that his parents haven't strangled him is a major miracle.<br /><br />For the reader, this is a wonderful treat, because it means we get to watch Calvin in one adventure after another refusing to learn anything.  And his imagination makes those adventures far out.  He might be Spaceman Spiff, battling the evil Zorg who want to torture him by sending him to school.  He might create a duplicator and create duplicates of himself to ease his homework load.  He might don his Stupendous Man costume to fight his nemesis Babysitter Fiend.  Or he might use his time machine to travel forward in time to get his completed homework from his future self.  And don't forget a nice round of Calvinball.  Or a meeting of the top secret club GROSS (Get Rid Of Slimy girlS).<br /><br />This strip was full of creativity and fun.  Part of its charm was its ability to give a nostalgic look back at childhood through realist's glasses.<br /><br />As the series progressed, its creator began to include some social satire in his strips.  This became seriously hysterical.  I just loved Calvin's gum magazine \\"Chewing.\\"<br /><br />This set is designed for collectors.  It includes everything done for the strip over the years in three hardbound books collected in a slip case.  This includes an all new introduction as well as covers and extra illustrations done for the collections over the years.  The biggest draw back is the size.  These are heavy books, and it's really hard to curl up with them and read for a few hours.<br /><br />This set is for the serious Calvin and Hobbes fan.  If you aren't already in love with these characters, find a collection today so you can meet them.  Either way, you'll want the paperback collections for your everyday Calvin and Hobbes reading.<br /><br />And maybe, someday, we can convince Bill Watterson to come out of retirement and give us further adventures of this wonderful duo.curl up with them and read for a few hours. <br /> <br />This set is for the serious Calvin and Hobbes fan.

An assistant at an archeological dig by day, she behaves like a pothunter at night, digging for any artifact she can find and sell.  Always on her mind is the need to pay the property taxes on her ancestral home.  One valuable item is all that separates her from keeping her property safe for another year.<br /><br />One evening's dig turns up a skull.  Intrigued by this unexpected find, Faye takes an earring and begins to look into local stories of missing girls.<br /><br />The next morning, Faye arrives at the dig site to find two students missing.  When things begin not to add up, Faye gets concerned.  When their bodies are found, the dig shuts down.  How can Faye earn much needed money now?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Faye is on a quest to gain back the rest of her ancestral lands.  And there's another pothunter loose in her neck of the woods.  Will he ruin a good site?  Will his digging get her arrested for her illegal work as well?<br /><br />This book is very literary in style and not like the mysteries I'm used to reading.  As such, I started to get very frustrated with it.  The story had too many threads and the cast of characters was a little hard to keep straight.  Furthermore, Faye's questionable morals also rankled me.  But as the story progressed, I began to sort things out and got hooked.  The plot may have bitten off one or two sub-plots more then it really needed, but they all come together well.  Faye grew into a character I couldn't help but love.  And I just couldn't put the book down when I reached the climax.<br /><br />I'm glad I stuck it out and finish the book.  It was well worth the time and energy invested in it.  I will most certainly be getting the next one.	2005-09-30

Even before she blew off her own debutante ball, she had become best friends with Molly, the \\"scholarship girl\\" at Andy's exclusive high school.<br /><br />Close during high school and the beginning of college, Molly and Andy lost touch over the years.  Until one morning when Molly calls Andy from the police station.  Molly's boss has been murdered and Molly is the police's only suspect.  Not that it's too much of a wild conclusion since she was seen leaving the scene of the crime and her fingerprints are the only ones on the murder weapon.<br /><br />With the police not looking at anyone else, Andy decides to go undercover at the restaurant to find the real killer.  Poking around, she begins to find out that no one liked the victim.  In fact, the list of possible suspects includes anyone who ever met the man.  Andy's sure that Molly is innocent.  But can she find the right piece of information to convince the police they have the wrong person behind bars?<br /><br />The book starts off with a bang that draws the reader in quickly.  Unfortunately, the plot is a little uneven, slowing down in the middle.  Even so, the writing is so engaging and the characters so endearing it's hard to put the book down.  The final third is a race to the finish.<br /><br />As I said, the characters are also endearing right from the start.  Andy and Molly's friendship seems so real even after the time apart, you root for things to work out.  Cissy, Andy's mother, is shown to have a much bigger heart then Andy would lead the reader to believe.  She's a great character and her scenes were laugh out loud funny.  She should have had more page time.<br /><br />Even though the plot got lost a time or two, this is still an entertaining read for anyone looking for a light book.  The characters have worked their way into my heart, and I will drop in on them again soon.	2005-09-26

He and his wife are content but unhappy at never having had children.  This will take away that reproach for the rest of his life.  Then an angel of the Lord appears and promises that his wife, long past childbearing years, will have a son.  Zachariah's lack of belief renders him speechless.<br /><br />This amazing sign only increases the paranoia of Herod, king of Judea.  Herod has no true claim to the Jewish throne yet claims to be a descendant of David.  Rumors of the coming Messiah only make him more nervous.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in Nazareth, a young woman also receives a visit from an angel.  Mary is awed to learn she has been chosen to bear Messiah.  But what will her family say?  Does this mean she will loose the love of Yosef, her betrothed?  Will her faith in God be enough to sustain her?<br /><br />The Thoenes have a wonderful gift for telling stories of ordinary people caught up in world shaping events.  This book is no exception.  Even when we know the outcome of most of the stories, their writing pulls you in and enchants you.  And the storylines of the fictitious characters were certainly suspenseful.<br /><br />It is a little surprising to see them switch gears from the building storyline of the last three books to the birth of John.  While the prologue and epilogue do tie into the last book, it felt a little odd.<br /><br />Still, they provide their normal incites into the story we all know.  I was especially fascinated by the astronomer's logs and the genealogical explanations.  And they are able to bring Mary and Yosef to life in a very human way.  While I knew the outcome, I cared deeply about them and wanted to see them reach it.<br /><br />This turn of events has left me puzzling where the next book will go - back to Christmas or on toward Easter?  Either way, I'll be back for it.<br /><br />This book would be perfect to read in early December.  It got me in the Christmas mood, and I even had to pull out my Christmas music before I was done reading it.ect to read in early December.

No, the FDA hasn't added another level to the pyramid; it's a group of local merchants who are involved in fancy food and parties.  Organized by Julie Singletree, a woman trying to get a party planning business going, the group exchanges tips via e-mail.  Julie also uses their e-mail list to forward inspirational messages several times a day.  Lee has had enough of the spam when the news breaks - Julie has been murdered and her computer stolen.<br /><br />Lee fully intends to stay out of this investigation.  After all, Julie lived in a neighboring town.  But the morning after the funeral, several members of the group are hit by a computer virus.  Another has her shop broken into and her computer's memory erased.  As things continue to escalate, Lee can't keep her curiosity to herself and begins nosing around.<br /><br />As if all this weren't enough, Joe and Lee are trying to work out the details of their upcoming wedding.  Joe wants a big fancy affair and Lee just wants a few family members and close friends.  Meanwhile, Aunt Nettie's sister-in-law contacts the shop hoping to find a job for her son, making Lee feel very insecure.<br /><br />This series always entertains, and this book was no exception.  The plot was a study in contrast.  Some things jumped out and were obvious before the characters saw them; others were smack-your-head-how-could-I-miss-that moments.  By the end there were lots of clues pointing to the killer, so chances are the reader will miss some if not all of them.  Lee's \\"tong tangles\\" are kept to a minimum, mostly sprinkled into a few tense scenes.<br /><br />The chocolate chats this go around were quotes about chocolate.  It might be about time to drop the trivia and focus on the mystery.  While it was a fun gimmick, it won't be missed.<br /><br />Like candy, you can't read just one.  I'm already hungry for the next volume.	2005-09-16

I was skeptical when I heard about this book, thinking it was just an excuse to make more money.  My fears were justified.<br /><br />This book goes back years before the series starts to find Rayford as a nine-year-old.  He knows what he wants to do, be a professional athlete or a pilot.  And there is no way he is taking over his father's tool and die business.  In fact, his parents embarrass him.  They're older then his friend's parents are and poorer then Ray would like.  He is determined to become rich no matter which career path he takes.<br /><br />Meanwhile in Romania, Marilena Carpathia has become surprised to find a longing for a child.  Trapped in a marriage without romance, she searches to find a distraction.  That distraction leads her to Viviana Ivinisova's class on spiritualism and a potential solution.  Should she accept the offer even if it means raising her child as a spiritualist?<br /><br />The problem with this book is that it really doesn't have a story to tell.  We already know what will happen to the characters, so much of the suspense is gone.  It serves more as biography then novel.  I was also rolling my eyes as Ray spent time analyzing his actions toward his parents.  I know of no nine-years-olds who have the incite he did.  Heck, some adults wouldn't look at things that way.<br /><br />There were some points of the book that held my interest, but these were few and far between.  The lack of a story made the poor writing of the previous entries stand out even more here.  My advice is to stick with the originals and skip the prequels.  You aren't missing much.	2005-09-09

Part of that adjustment is running Divinity Candy Shop, which she just inherited from her aunt.<br /><br />But adjusting to life in a small town also means adjusting to local politics.  The Downtown Merchants Alliance is currently debating the merits of moving the local Arts Festival to the downtown area.  The issue is hotly contested.  Brandon Mills is spearheading the effort to move it, so when he doesn't show up at a meeting about the issue, Abby is concerned.  That night, Brandon's shop burns down - an act of arson.  Then Brandon's bones are found in the ruins and Abby's brother Wyatt becomes the chief suspect.  With the detective assigned to the case infuriating Abby, she decides to step in and see what other motives she can dig up.  What she uncovers sheds a whole new light on many people she knows.  Yet more and more the evidence is pointing to Wyatt.  Did he do it?  If not, can Abby clear him?<br /><br />I've been looking forward to this book for quite some time, so I started reading as soon as I could.  The small town is nice and I really felt at home there.  The main characters are well drawn and I really liked them.  Abby especially is a likeable heroine and I couldn't help cheering out loud for her on a couple occasions.  The plot could have used a little polish, however.  Several plot lines seemed to get dropped and the ending felt rushed.  A bit longer book could have ironed out these problems.  The book ends with several candy recipes which certainly sound tempting.<br /><br />Overall, the book is an enjoyable debut with leaves you hungry for more.	2005-09-06

Now anyone can enjoy the stories in a new way thanks to these wonderful recordings.<br /><br />This set contains radio drama versions of all seven books.  There are a total of nineteen CD's and over twenty-six hours of adventure.  Each story has been fully dramatized and is presented with a full cast, sound effects, and background music - everything to bring the story fully to life.  The stories stick very close to the books.  Paul Scofield serves as our narrator, describing settings and actions so we aren't left out of a moment.  Additionally, Douglas Gresham, C. S. Lewis' stepson, gives us some trivia about the creation of each book in his roll as host of the set.<br /><br />Of course, every adaptation is going to have some drawbacks to fans from another media.  The biggest for me is Aslan.  I found his voice too slow for my picture of the character.  Scenes with a large number of people were often a little hard to follow when the voices sounded similar.  And do take the warning seriously.  This set isn't for young children as some parts could scare them.  Over all, these are minor quibbles of a die-hard Narnia fanatic.<br /><br />While nothing will replace the books, this set is another great way to enter a fun fantasy world.  I used it to make the miles fly by on a couple road trips.  Highly recommended for Narnia fans of all ages.	2005-09-01

While she fumes, Vaughn and Nadia are called in to complete the mission.  Only with this case, nothing is ever easy and the bad news just keeps coming in.  Can the three agents stay alive long enough to find the cure for Weiss?<br /><br />The Alias books seem to be hit or miss recently, and this one is no exception.  The story starts out well, and I was enjoying it.  As the book progressed, I got more and more frustrated.  The plot relies on the agents making critical mistakes.  While I found the first few believable, by the end I was rolling my eyes as they were doing things I knew better then to do.  Sydney gets more and more annoying as the story progresses as well, snapping at everyone around her.  And one final complaint, although this one is minor.  The book keeps saying they need to find a vaccine for Weiss, when in reality they should have been looking for an antidote.<br /><br />Making the Alias books longer has not been the best decision.  I am about ready to stop reading them and just enjoy the series on TV when it comes back on the air.	2005-08-30

With hair died red and dressed in a mermaid costume, things seem weird.  A vile is found inside her that contains pictures from Mark Sloan's very first case.<br /><br />In February 1962, during another huge rain storm, a dead woman is brought into the ER.  Everyone assumes she drowned during the rain storm, but Mark thinks something fishy is going on.  When they find evidence of murder, Mark just can't let it go, even when it puts him at odds with the detective, former friend Harry Trumble.  Can an inexperienced doctor solve the crime?  Even more intriguing, what does this 40+ year old murder case have to do with the present murder?<br /><br />This book is ingenious.  About half of it is set in the past and half set in the present.  Really, you get two mysteries for the price of one as we watch Mark solve both cases.  Yet they interact in a way I never saw coming.  Seeing glimpses of Mark's past was enlightening as well.  I really felt like I was back in 1962 for those scenes.  Once again, Lee brings events from the series into the book making me wish I'd seen more of the earlier episodes.<br /><br />These books are fast becoming one of my favorite series around.  If you were a fan of the show, you owe it to yourself to pick up this great continuation.  Even if you've never seen the series, the plots will pull you in and make you start looking for the reruns.

In this volume he collects 11 of those stories along with additional thoughts on the themes presented there.  Along the way, we get stories about judging other, aging, the basis of faith, dealing with bullies, and pride.  The last story will ring a bell with fans.  Award winning \\"Crazy Carl\\" was changed ever so slightly and used as the wrap around for Sunrise at the Mayan Temple.<br /><br />When I learned Ricky and the gang had stared in some short stories, I wanted to read them.  Naturally, I was thrilled to hear about this book.  And it more then surpassed my expectations.  Sigmund's ability to bring fresh insight to familiar themes is remarkable.  And he makes the lessons entertaining as well as challenging.<br /><br />My only disappointment is the lack of scripture references.  With a Bible reading section, it would make an awesome devotional.  Even without them, this is a book that will entertain and challenge anyone with how they live their daily lives.	2005-08-18

But the once simple affair has turned into a complicated production with all the trimmings and potentially hurt feelings in the village.  It only gets worse with Mrs. Evans, who still hasn't warmed up to Bronwen, shows up early.<br /><br />But all that's minor compared to the missing girl.  Her boyfriend first finds Evan and tells him that they got separated on the mountain.  Search parties can find no trace of her, and with the crowds from tourist season, no one seems to remember her from the crowd.  The discovery of an empty bunker near a trail adds to the intensity of their search.  Evan, meanwhile, is getting messages from the maniac - musical clues that he needs to solve to solve the case.  Why has he been singled out?  What do they mean?  Will they find the girl?<br /><br />This book, like the last few in the series, is a little darker then the early books.  Even so, it's just a shade darker, and the interactions with the residence of Llanfair and the plans for the wedding help keep it fun.  The plot seems to get bogged down in the middle, and I was getting frustrated.  Of course, the characters were frustrated as well, so I figured I was in good company.  Then the final 100 pages hit and the plot really took off.  It took all my will power not to keep reading past my lunch hour.  I thought I had it solved early on, but was thrilled to see that there were some nice twists I hadn't expected.  And I simply loved the ending.<br /><br />This book does mention a few previous cases, so you might want to stay away until you've read the others in the series.  Series fans will love this latest adventure with Evan and be left wanting more.  I'm certainly ready for the next one.	2005-08-16

Each winner is more obnoxious and spoiled then the one before.  Is there any hope that Charlie will get to go?  And if he does, what wonders await him inside?<br /><br />Ok, so the title gives away any suspense the first part might have over whether he will get a ticket or not.  But the book is wonderful fun.  I read it a couple times as a kid and after watching the recent movie was inspired to pick it up again.  I had forgotten how many puns there are and laughed at many of them.  The story is rather straight forward but it is told with such creative rooms you can't help but read on to see where everyone goes next and what happens to them when they get there.

The last things she needs is her nanny to leave with no warning.  But Marlene and all her stuff are gone and there's no clue where she might be.  Since Marlene is the daughter of Jane's oldest friend, she feels some responsibility to find out what happened.  As she begins poking around, she begins to find out that Marlene had a secret nightlife that could have put her in danger.  Can Jane find the girl in time?<br /><br />This book had come highly recommended to me, and I couldn't wait to get to it.  It was a little rough at the beginning, but I soon got into the story.  The characters grew on me, especially Jane.  The plot moved forward quickly, and the book itself was a very fast read.  My only real complaint was one particular plot development.  Some of the language and sexual topics surprised me since the book seemed so cozy from the cover.<br /><br />Shady Hills is a wonderful little town, and I enjoyed my visit.  I plan to visit it again soon.	2005-08-10

None of her friends believe her, and it turns out they are right.  On the night they arrive, a fierce storm hits the island, and the Bob-Whites find a letter in the library of the house they are staying in.  It sounds like some money was hidden years ago.  But who hid it?  Is it still there?  And where might they find the map?  Meanwhile, they've befriended their neighbor Peter who introduces them to the wonderful sport of sailing.  Might his knowledge help them find the money?<br /><br />I knew this was a favorite in the series, but I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed it until I reread it.  Yes, the plot gets a little slow at times, but all in all, it's a lot of fun and comes together in the end for a very satisfying solution.  The characters are the best versions of themselves without some of their flaws being over exaggerated like in other books in the series.  Even Diana is able to contribute and doesn't come across as a fraidy cat.  The only thing that could make it better is if Dan had been able to go.<br /><br />This adventure in the series is certainly not to be missed.	2005-08-08

The twelve-year-old tells her about his ancestor Josiah who carved grave stones before he disappeared during the start of the American Revolution.  Sweeney is intrigued by his unusual death's heads, so she decides to do further research on him.<br /><br />Heading home, Pres and Sweeney find the body of a man dressed in a costume from one of the many reenactments that take place nearby.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Detective Tim Quinn is working on his own missing person case.  A history professor researching Josiah Whiting in between reenactments in Concord has vanished.  Why did his wife take so long to report him missing?  Is he the body Sweeney has discovered?  And what is the explosive revelation he had in his book about Josiah?<br /><br />Once again, Sarah Stewart Taylor has written a great book.  She expertly weaves mysteries of the past and present together.  I especially enjoyed the historical setting of the Revolutionary War since it's one of my favorite times of American history.  The writing style continues to pull you in, and the events and characters have a decidedly dark edge to them, as you would expect from a series dealing with funeral art.  There are some very cool twists in the plot; the fact that I spotted a couple before Sweeney didn't dampen my enjoyment of them at all.<br /><br />This book has a serious flaw, however.  Tim Quinn has been elevated to co-star status, but he seems to be trying to take over the book.  I didn't actually count, but it felt like he had more page time then Sweeney did, and his sub-plot about finding day care for Megan slowed down the first third of the story.  He also felt like he got more character development this time around.  This is all compounded by the fact that I don't like him nearly as much as Sweeney or even Toby, who only got a cameo roll in this book.<br /><br />Overall, this is another great book in a fascinating series.  I'm certainly looking forward to Sweeney's next case.ing series.  I'm certainly looking forward to Sweeney's next case.	2005-08-03

In fact, it was almost beneath Sydney and Dixon's talents.  That is until armed men corner Sydney on the roof of a building.  In her attempt to escape, an innocent office worker is shot.<br /><br />The failed mission means big trouble to APO.  Someone was piggy backing on their surveillance, and they need to know who.  The trail leads to Peru, where a member of the team is taken hostage.  Can Sydney overcome her guilt over innocents hurt to save the day?<br /><br />After the last couple tie-in novels, I was about ready to quit, but I'm glad I gave it one more shot.  This is the strongest for a while.  The plot was entertaining and moved along quickly.  The characters were strong and leap off the page into their TV personas without any extra work on my part.  There were times when the book seemed slightly overwritten, but for the most part, this author avoided that pitfall, even when giving background needed for newer viewers.  And long time viewers will be rewarded with some resolve to emotional issues from years back.<br /><br />If you can't get enough of this show, this is a great place to get a summer fix.	2005-07-27

Even after listening to Martin's story, Stanley turns him down.  Stanley patiently explains that the sign on his door is a joke and he doesn't take cases like that.  But when Stanley sees an article in the next day's paper about Martin's murder, he can't help but take the case, even if there is no client and it interferes with his regular job as an ambulance chaser.<br /><br />Martin was involved in a drug ring, and Stanley must work his way inside to get the proof he needs.  Of course, sneaking around on his wife and the villains is a recipe for disaster.  And the more he pokes around, the more danger he creates for himself.<br /><br />This book came highly recommended to me, so I had high hopes for it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  The middle half of the book was dead, with very little happening.  In fact, we started hearing past stories about Stanley's job chasing ambulances to fill the time.  On the other hand, the last 70 pages were tight and I couldn't put them down.  My other problem shouldn't have come as a surprise to me.  With descriptions like \\"seedy\\" and \\"gritty\\" on the cover, the language shouldn't have taken me back like it did.  I realize this is a personal issue, but it did effect my enjoyment of the book as well.<br /><br />I ventured outside my normal reading habits with this book, and was reminded of why I usually don't stray.  While many people like it, this series is not for me.	2005-07-20

But her friend Danny thinks she can shed some light on the weird things being found around the house.  Sure enough, the odd items are tips from Jo's \\"Tips from Tulip\\" household hints column.  But when the chief concludes that Edna Pratt's death was an accident, Jo disagrees.  Convinced that it was murder and with some personal issues she'd like a distraction from, she drags Danny into the investigation.  Can they figure out what really happened?<br /><br />Being a fan of Mindy Starns Clark's other series, I was looking forward to this debut.  I was not disappointed.  Jo and Danny are great new characters, and Ms. Clark has such a great way of making them likeable right from the start.  The murder plot is a little slow in the first half of the book as things in the character's personal lives take center stage.  Even so, I couldn't put it down wanting to know what would happen next.  And once the mystery takes over, it really gets interesting and exciting.  The spiritual topics touched upon made me stop and think myself, and I'm hoping they are central themes in this series.<br /><br />I'm quite anxious to see where this series goes next.  You can bet I'll be buying book two as soon as it's released.	2005-07-14

His worst fears are realized when Joel's disappearance causes Ricky to detour the bus they're traveling on.  Still, the worst part of the vacation seems to be Mike's cousin Sarah who loves to tease Ricky.<br /><br />Not too long after they arrive, they hear the legend of the Phantom Outlaw.  After a bank robbery 50 years ago, the robber disappeared but is said to still haunt the cliffs where she died.  Mike, Ralphy, and Ricky soon encounter the figure.  But how real is it?  And where are the missing cattle going?<br /><br />Honestly, I had forgotten much of this book, only remembering one key clue.  As such, I was able to enjoy again all the clues and laughs in this adventure.  It's another winner only slightly marred by the absence of Lisa.  Another well thought out plot with great clues and fun character interactions.<br /><br />This is a series everyone will enjoy no matter what their age.  It'll even appeal to reluctant readers with the short chapters and fast moving storylines.	2005-07-13

She can hardly wait until everyone arrives, even if Great-aunt Hannah is coming, too.<br /><br />Things get off to a rocky start with Hannah's opinions rubbing the cousins the wrong way as usual.  And her son's appearance doesn't help.  Still, Anne is surprised when she finds Hannah dead the next morning.  She even more surprised when the murder weapon turns out to be a knife from her own kitchen.  And with Detective Burns looking for a way to get back at Anne's boyfriend, Anne's going to have to figure things out if she wants to stay out of jail.  But this makes her cousins the suspects.  And a little digging turns up secrets that could give each of them motive.  Will Anne be crushed by the solution to this case?<br /><br />Once again, Beth Sherman has put together a wonderful book full of pieces that feel like they should go together, but don't seem to somehow.  Anne becomes her most human in this book, and I really liked how her character and her relationship with Trasker developed.  As always, the elements of a resort town with dark edges creates an unsettling feeling that is both inviting and frightening at the same time, creating the perfect mood for the book.<br /><br />I'm sorry to catch up on this series with what looks like the final book.  I've enjoyed vacationing with Anne, even if there was danger is such a friendly setting.	2005-07-12

But when a body turns up with what the police chief thinks is a crossword puzzle clue, they are suddenly thrust into the limelight.  Did the killer leave behind a crossword puzzle clue?  What does it mean?  And how could it possibly lead to the killer?<br /><br />I bought this book a couple years back after hearing the author speak, but then started hearing rumors about Cora.  I thought I might be put off by the fact that she is a chain smoking alcoholic.  While that did bother me, I couldn't help falling in love with all the characters in this book.  I've heard in later books that aspect of her character is dropped, and I'll certainly look forward to that.  In the mean time, I found her a fun character I could root for.  My other problem with the book was the constant use of characters full names.  Almost every time a new paragraph started, the author felt the need to refer to Sherry Carter or Cora Felton or who ever the current character was.  That got very annoying in a hurry.<br /><br />Still, this book provided a great puzzle I had a hard time putting down.  Nothing made sense until the end when everything falls into logical place.  The author spent the majority of the time with four of the characters, and the multiple viewpoints worked well to tell the story and build suspense at the end.  As I said, I really liked all four of the characters, and I'm looking forward to seeing them again in the next book.  Another aspect I enjoyed was the word play between characters, especially Sherry and newspaper reporter Aaron Grant.  Fans of crossword puzzles will enjoy the puzzle at the beginning of the book.  There is a solution in the back for those like me who get stuck easily.  Just a word of warning, the puzzle is meant to be solved after the book is read since some of the clues have to do with the plot of the book and therefore could spoil it for you.<br /><br />While this book has some serious flaws that will turn others off, I found the plot and characters engaging enough I could over look them.  I will certainly be back to visit the cozy town of Bakerhaven.poil it for you.

Her old lover wants her help in something, but will only tell her once she has arrived on his private island off Southern Carolina.  It's there that Henrie is shocked to learn that someone tried to poison Chase.  With all the suspects on the island, all Henrie has to do is use her reporter background and find the right suspect before he or she succeeds.<br /><br />Henrie isn't too keen on the idea, insisting the police should be involved.  But she agrees to poke around.  Once the villain tries to shoot at Chase, the stakes are raised.  But the danger is only beginning when the group is trapped on the island as a hurricane approaches.<br /><br />Reading the book, I couldn't help but feel the setup was familiar.  We've seen it in lots of mysteries before - isolated group marooned from everyone else with a killer on the loose.  Even given this, I couldn't stop reading.  Part of this is Ms. Hart's style.  It pulls you in and makes everything seem new.  I got so engrossed in the second half I read it in one sitting.  The few clues were so hidden by red herrings I didn't see them until after I'd finished.<br /><br />So why the four stars?  Because the ending was weak.  While I have no problem with the solution, the way it was handled seemed rushed and forced.  Almost like the author knew she was out of room and it was time to end the book.<br /><br />I'd really like to give the book 4.5 stars.  It's a great read that kept me glued to my seat to find out what was going on.  With a little better ending, I wouldn't have anything to complain about.	2005-06-27

Recovering it is the top priority of the CIA.<br /><br />APO has received a lead from an unlikely source.  Maya Rao is an Indian assassin who has crossed paths with Sydney in the past.  But she steps forward with a lead and a request to work together with Sydney.  Naturally, Sydney doesn't like the idea, but what else can she do?  Even more disturbing are Maya's constant comments that she and Sydney are more alike then different.  Can this be true?  What are Maya's real motives?  Will they track down the plane?<br /><br />This book started out well, but died under the weight of its story.  It felt entirely too long.  Maybe it's just that this is longer then the prequels were, but I was ready for it to be done long before the climax came.  I was also distracted by the constant references to events from the show.  While a few are good, it got to the point of excess very quickly.  The climax did stretch believability; I didn't have as big a problem with it as I might have, probably because I was ready for the book to be over.<br /><br />While never classic literature, I have enjoyed the Alias tie in novels in the past.  Hopefully this is an exception and the next will be back to the enjoyable quick reads that the others have been.	2005-06-23

She's been invited to give the keynote address at the annual Nancy Drew convention being held just down the road in Palm Springs.  Even better, she and her friends Lael and Bridget have been offered the use of a vacation home while in the area.  Cece's only met \\"blue\\" Nancy collector Edgar Edwards once, but she won't turn down a free place to stay.<br /><br />Unfortunately, their weekend out is brought to a sobering conclusion when they find Edgar's body in the master bedroom.  Combine that with the vandalism that Cece has been experiencing, and you've got a case that would make Nancy proud.  Can Cece find the clues to solve it?<br /><br />Ok, I confess, I'm a fan of kid's series mysteries.  As a result, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book.  It did provide plenty of Nancy trivia, just enough to whet the appetite.  I like the way the author used Cece's research to further the story.  The biography wasn't just a gimmick but part of the plot.  The story itself is a real puzzler.  Once again, I didn't figure it out until the satisfying conclusion.  There did seem to be a few snags were the story stalled a little, but overall it progressed well.<br /><br />This series has a unique premise and some great puzzles.  I can't wait to see where mystery author biographing takes Cece next.	2005-06-22

Six tickets have arrived to send Joel Kidd on a ten day trip to a dig in Mexico.  But inconceivable as it may be, there are the tickets for Ricky's younger brother.  What's even more inconceivable is that Ricky and his friends find themselves on a plane to explain that there must have been a mix-up with the tickets.<br /><br />The gang has just arrived in Mexico when Ricky begins to notice how afraid the natives are of their host, Senor Castillo.  Every time his name is mentioned, they abandon the group as if they were sick.  But it's after a midnight visit to a hut nearby that Ricky learns about the danger in the area.  Can the accidental detectives figure out what the reappearance of an ancient and evil legend really means?<br /><br />Yet another wonderful entry in this great series.  There is a lot more humor then I remembered in this entry, and I loved it.  Especially the running joke about the word \\"Inconceivable.\\"  I will admit to feeling the ending was a little weak morally in this entry.<br /><br />While not the strongest in the series, this is still a great book.  It'll be a fast read because you'll want to know how it ends.	2005-06-14

Personal tragedy awaits the Burkes and the English will use anything to crack down on the Irish.  Plus the biggest roadblock to Irish independence may be just around the corner in the form of rotten potatoes.<br /><br />It's been way too long since I read the third book in the series and I had forgotten some of the details of it.  The important pieces did come back to me as I read the events of this one, however.  My problem with it is the story.  All the events of the story pile on top of each other to make for a depressing read.  I realize it was what was happening in Ireland during that time, but it still isn't pleasant to read.<br /><br />The Thoenes have a gift of bring history to life.  Unfortunately, it's not always happy.  This is one such case.  Wonderfully written book, it's just a shame the subject matter is such a downer.	2005-06-10

True, he's not living in an orphanage, but his uncle and aunt treat him horribly.  He has to live in a closet and watch as his spoiled cousin gets everything he wants.<br /><br />All that changes one day when he starts getting mysterious letters.  Every day, his uncle tries to destroy them, but more keep arriving.  Finally, Harry learns the truth - he is a wizard and a relatively famous one for surviving the attack that killed his parents.  Arriving at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry begins to make friends for the first time in his life.<br /><br />But all is not as it seems at the school.  Harry begins to pick up little clues that evil is lurking somewhere in the building.  And one of the professors seems to have it in for him.  What is going on?<br /><br />Yes, I'm coming rather late to the party, but I can certainly see what all the talk is about.  These are fun, escapist books.  J. K. Rowling has written a book that can capture the imagination of kids of all ages.  My complaint is the pace of the plot.  The first half moves rather slowly as we are introduced to Harry's world.  While that background is needed and fun, I was certainly ready for things to start moving forward by the second half.  Fortunately, the second half picks up speed.<br /><br />This book will entertain the kid in anyone.  I already have plans to enroll in the next year at Hogwarts.	2005-06-09

Visiting his favorite high end fashion boutique, Jaine doesn't find any clothes, but does land a potential client for her writing business.  Coming in early to pitch ideas one morning, Jaine finds the body of Frenchie with one of the woman's own stiletto heels stuck in her neck.  To know Frenchie was to loath her, so the list of suspects in long. The police are zeroing in on a woman who wouldn't hurt a fly, literally.  When Becky hires Jaine to find the real killer, Jaine drops all her current writing assignments (ok, she had none anyway) to pursue the clues.  Meanwhile, her father has his heart set on the lead in a play at her parent's retirement village, one of her memoir writing students suffers a heart attack, and Kandi signs both herself and Jaine up for speed dating.<br /><br />Fans of this series will love the latest entry.  All the charm and sarcastic humor of the others is present.  I smiled, giggle, and laughed my way through the entire book.  The book is very well set up.  By the time the murder takes place, you are aware of several suspects.  And how can you not love such an inventive murder weapon?  The ending felt a little rushed to me and definitely could have used a few more pages to better flesh things out.<br /><br />This book will appeal to those who love light mysteries.  If that's you, this series is in fashion.	2005-06-01

While waiting for their flight to come in from Iowa, Trixie notices a strange Mexican woman who can't find her flight.  After helping, the woman gives Trixie a purse with a fortune inside.<br /><br />A couple hours later, Trixie spies an idol so ugly it's cute she just has to buy.  But almost immediately, some thugs are following the teens around.  Are they after the idol?  Why?  Can Trixie use the prophecy to solve the case before more danger strikes?<br /><br />This is a fun book in the series.  Not only are all seven Bob-Whites along for the adventure but we get to spend more time with friends we've made earlier in the series, a rare treat.  The tour of New York City is fun and the plot lively and entertaining enough to keep you glued to the book.  My problem with it is the prophecy.  I don't believe in fortune telling and so have a very hard time accepting that part of the plot.<br /><br />Most fans of the Trixie books like the prophecy, which makes me the exception to the rule.  Other then that, it's a great case that will entertain Trixie's many fans.	2005-05-30

Her neighbor's boat has just blown up.  Quick diving saves Elyse Henry's life, but she's in a coma in the hospital.  Chief of Police Dunn thinks that it was a tragic accident, but Hannah is convinced her friend is the victim of an attempted murder.  Since Elyse's work as an environmentalist wasn't always received well, the list of potential suspects is rather long.  Can Hannah put the pieces together?<br /><br />So the series has never been a favorite with me, but I have enjoyed them.  This time, the flaws of the series were too much.  The sub-plot about charters being robbed was obvious from the very beginning.  The book is obviously a lecture on the environment, but the characters fell into two camps, the good environmentalists and the evil business owners.  The only exception to that was Hannah's boyfriend O'Brien.  There were also times the story was stopped so we could have characters lecture us on the importance of their pet environmental issue.  Finally, the author and editor paid no attention to detail, referring to events from several days ago as yesterday and calling the same meal breakfast and lunch multiple times within a few pages.<br /><br />The idea of a scuba diver in the British Virgin Islands is a great premise, and I've been generous to the series in the past, hoping it will improve.  After this outing, I'm not holding my breath.	2005-05-26

Debriefing her, they learn the stakes are much higher then they could ever image and a race starts to prevent an international crisis.<br /><br />I was a little surprised when I learned that the novels would be jumping ahead from prequels (which I was enjoying) to the current setting for the show.  Even more surprising was the increase in page count.  Still, I settled in to enjoy a fun read.  Unfortunately, the first half was rather poorly written.  While the story moves forward well, the writing is extremely weak.  I finally figured out it's because the story is told, not shown.  We are told what characters are feeling instead of them acting it out for us.  What's even worse, we are often told that character A knows what character B is going through.<br /><br />I was becoming very frustrated when I reached the half way point.  From there, the book really picks up.  It's basically one long mission, and the action moves quickly from character to character, filling us in on everything going on.  At this point, I was frustrated every time I got interrupted and couldn't wait to get back to it.<br /><br />This book fits in perfectly with the first half of the season.  Overall, it's a wise choice to move the novels to the current time so they can feature the characters and situations the freshest in the viewer's mind.  Hopefully future books will have just a bit more polish to the writing.	2005-05-24

No group to lead.  No future trips to plan.  Just a chance to relax and hang out with some old friends who have just started running a resort in the Florida Keys.  And the fact that it's only a couple weeks until Christmas certainly helped make the decision easier.<br /><br />The morning after Lynne and her daughter arrive, Lynne finds a dead body on the dock.  Darcy lived in the mobile home park next door and was fundamental in running the activities the resort and park did each month.  Certainly she didn't have any enemies.  But as the police investigate, they turn up a habit of kleptomania and a sideline of drug smuggling.  Could either of these be what got her killed?<br /><br />These books are all about the characters, and once again, Emily Toll has created a strong set, many of whom I'd like to get to know as friends.  A few are annoying, but they're supposed to be, and it's rather fun watching them misbehave.  The problem comes with the plot.  Again, Lynne hardly does any investigating, trying to ignore the problems swirling around her as much as possible.  This bothers me a little, maybe because of the other books I read.  The conclusion is less then satisfying in this one.<br /><br />Even with a plot that's on the weak side, it's hard not to like this book because of the strong characters.  3.5 rounded up to a four.	2005-05-18

He is strict, somber, and by the numbers.  But when the vicar returns home late for a meeting, he's surprised to find Colonel Protheroe shot through the head.  The local police are called in and two people confess.  Yet something doesn't seem quite right.  Fortunately, Miss Marple lives next door.  With her sharp mind talent for learning gossip, she just might make sense of everything that's happening.<br /><br />Ok, I confess.  I love a good cozy mystery but have yet to read much Christie.  I can tell I need to change that.  This book had me confused from the get go.  There were so many red herrings it was hard to tell what was really happening.  Yet it all came together at the end in a logical conclusion.<br /><br />I checked this audio version out of the local library for a trip and only after listening to it discovered that it was abridged.  While disappointed, I never would have noticed.  It was expertly cut, and everything was there I need to enjoy the story.  Ian Masters did a great job of bring the characters and story to life.<br /><br />Agatha Christie is a class mystery writer for a reason.  Anyone who loves a good puzzle with a surprising conclusion will love this book.	2005-05-12

Carolyn Keene was a real person.  In fact, she was Nancy Drew's college roommate who decided to use Nancy's exploits to make herself famous.  Turns out that Carolyn didn't get all the facts right, however, so Nancy has decided to set the record straight.<br /><br />This book is the story of the real Nancy Drew.  Taking 10 cases, it explores her life from the 1920's to 1992.  As the times change, so does Nancy's life.  But she still finds herself caught up in mysteries that often involve other famous teen sleuths like Frank and Joe Hardy, Judy Bolton, and Encyclopedia Brown.  And they are quite eye opening for all concerned.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it, this book is intended for adults and not kids.  There are lots of adult themes, and no halos are left intact.  Honestly, as a result, I found it oddly depressing at times.  Of course, part of that may be because I was watching characters I like struggle and change.  The author nailed that part when she has Nancy talk about how we the readers never want to seem these characters grow up or change.  On the other hand, I found the cameos by other teen sleuths (and there seems to be at least one every chapter) fun.  Obviously, the more you know about them, the more you'll enjoy the references.  A couple went over my head for the most part.  Of course, some come out looking better then others.  The storylines of each chapter are quite fun as they find Nancy in various points of history.  She gets involved in World War II, the red scare of the 50's, and Haight-Ashbury during the 60's as just a couple examples.<br /><br />This book's target audience is adults with fond memories of hours spent with teen sleuths as a kid.  They will most likely enjoy this take on the genre if they can allow their childhood heroes to become tarnished by real life.	2005-05-12

He's honored and looking forward to all the great food but dreading the train trip itself.<br /><br />They've hardly all gathered before the sparks fly.  One of the chefs is universally despised, and it's really no surprise to the reader when he turns up dead.  Not wanting to get involved in anything that might delay his return to his beloved brownstone, Wolfe vows to not get involved.  In spite of his efforts, he finds himself getting sucked in.  Can he stay alive, find the real killer, and still make his train?<br /><br />My best friend has recently started reading these books and keeps recommending them to me, so I picked this one up.  I can see why he likes them.  This story is a great puzzle.  I thought I had the plot figured out before the end, but I was only half right.  Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin make for two interesting leads.  I listened to the audio version, which made it a little hard to keep all the chefs straight.  The further I went the easier it was, however.  Michael Prichard does a great job of reading the story.<br /><br />If this is an example of why Nero Wolfe a classic character in the mystery genre, I can see why.  I will be looking for more books in this series.	2005-05-12

Her latest assignment for the J.O.S.H.U.A. Foundation is to investigate MORE, a non-profit set up by her in-laws in her late husband's memory.  This is the first time Callie has been back to visit his death, and she's a little nervous about how it will go.<br /><br />She's just relaxing at an impromptu family reunion when an explosion at the church shocks them all.  It's just some stink bombs, but the body nearby is definitely dead.  It's just the latest in a series of crimes targeted at Luisa, a migrant who stayed past harvest season because her husband is missing.  It doesn't take Callie long to realize that these events directly relate to her investigation of MORE, so she begins to investigate.  Will she be able to track down a migrant missing 6 months?  Who is behind the vandalism aimed at Luisa?  And who killed that John Doe in the church parking lot?<br /><br />I was once again thrilled to be in Callie's presence.  She's a great character I've really come to care about.  Unlike the last two in the series, I didn't feel the second half had quite the breakneck pace, but I did feel the novel was more evenly plotted overall.  There were still several twists I saw coming only a few pages before Callie, and the ending was certainly a surprise.<br /><br />With each book, I'm more and more glad I found this author.  If you haven't discovered Mindy Starns Clark, pick up the first book today.  You'll be very glad you did.	2005-05-11

On a rainy afternoon, Trixie finds an article about the search for some ghost fish.  Certain that this is the perfect way to raise some money for their latest project, Trixie convinces the others to join her.  But things begin to turn sour when they meet their guide.  Slim has a nasty streak, and there's something about him that Trixie doesn't trust.  Throw in a mysterious figure seen near an empty cabin and talk of ghosts and the Bob-Whites will have plenty to keep them busy.<br /><br />This book always raises a wishy-washy response to me.  I thought a mystery surrounding a cave would be cool as a kid, so I had high hopes.  The story starts off rather slowly, with lots of talk about ghosts that doesn't seem to lead anywhere.  Frankly, this makes the locals come off as stereotypically superstitious, which does bug me for some reason.  Trixie and Honey seem to have reverted to their personalities from the beginning of book one, and they're just as annoying now as they were then.<br /><br />However, the story picks up in the second half of the book.  I would still call the plot an adventure with mystery elements, but it really begins to move and is actually quite fun.<br /><br />This isn't the strongest entry in the series, but is rather fun over all.  It's still a thrill to see Random House re-releasing these books and keeping them just as I remember them from 20 years ago.	2005-04-28

With all the men off fighting the war, the editor was desperate.  It's hard work, but she's enjoying herself and gaining great experience.<br /><br />One night, her friend and neighbor Barb comes to her window asking for help.  They return to find Barb's mother, Faye, murdered in the living room.  Immediately, the rumors start about Faye's dancing at the local tavern every night while her husband is off at the war.  But Gretchen finds herself getting more caught up in events that will scandalize a small town and change her life forever.<br /><br />I'll admit this book took a chapter or two to fully get.  Each chapter starts with part of a letter the grown up Gretchen has received, a few thoughts of her own, then flashes back to the third person account of the story as it unfolded.  Once I got into the story, I was hooked.  Foreshadowing keeps the suspense up, while the writing style pulls you in.  I felt like I was in the small Oklahoma town that summer with its problems, prejudices, and pride.  The ending is as surprising as it is logical and extremely powerful.<br /><br />In spite of all I've heard about her, this is my first Carolyn Hart book.  It won't be my last.	2005-04-26

This is Another Great Read	Tommy Hanover, teenage son of a rich family has gone missing after a boating accident.  While searching for his body, Luanne finds a skeleton with a third eye in a sunken boat.  Trying to identify the bones leads Luanne to a mysterious graduate student.  What is he up to in the swamp?  Who belonged to the bones?  And will they ever find Tommy?<br /><br />I've been looking forward to this book because Glynn always weaves a great tale with wonderful writing.  I was not disappointed.  As always, the writing is atmospheric, and I felt like I was diving in the springs right beside Luanne.  I've grown to love the characters, and it's always nice to spend more time with them.  I especially enjoyed the sub-plot of Harry trying to get comfortable with diving again.  That's been a multi-book arc that has enriched the series.  And you've got to love Pasquin, Luanne's swamp neighbor.  The plot seemed to slow down in the second quarter, but picked up again at the half way point and kept moving until the end.<br /><br />This series combines mysteries, diving, great characters, and captivating writing.  Each book in this series should be savored.	2005-04-17

She's undergoing evaluation to turn her Welcome! greeting card store into a Willkommen! store so she can buy it.  And she's agreed to take part in a dating study, meaning she must go on 40 dates in 60 days after they've been screen by her friends.  The last thing she needs is that call from her brother.<br /><br />P.B. is paranoid schizophrenic and living at a psychiatric hospital.  When he calls saying he's witnessed a murder, Wollie doesn't take it too seriously.  Still, she decides to head out after her date that night to investigate...and almost runs over the dead body in the driveway.  Going inside to make sure he's ok, she is kidnapped by a handsome \\"Doc.\\"  Her attraction getting the better of her, she tries to help out Doc, and winds up with various criminals hot on her trail.  Will this effect her store getting its upgrade?  And can she keep to the dating schedule her friends have set up for her?  Will she even be alive to finish the study?<br /><br />I initially thought the mystery would surround the dating project and was mildly disappointed when I realized it wouldn't.  That didn't last for long, however, as I was soon swept up in the plot.  It's a bit overwhelming at first with lots of characters and sub-plots to keep straight, but I soon got everything together and just hung on for the ride.<br /><br />Wollie is a great character, as are her friends.  While I have a bit of a problem believing how she handled things at first, that might just be because there's no way I'd handle things that way.  By the second half of the book, I really didn't care about that any more and just settled in for the fun.  And the plot was great.  The dates took on an almost surreal aspect to them as she was trying to stay one step ahead of the bad guys while on them.  And the story kept me guessing until the end.<br /><br />This first book is a winner.  The only downside is I don't see how Ms. Kozak can possibly top it.  Still, I look forward to seeing her try.Still, I look forward to seeing her try.	2005-04-15

When Meg and Michael bought their house on the edge of town, they knew it would take lots of work.  For one thing, it's old, so there's plenty of repair work.  More immediate, the former owner was a pack rat, and they bought the house with all the contents as well.<br /><br />Now, after several months of hard work, they're ready for the yard sale to end all yard sales.  With plenty of Meg's relatives on hand to \\"help\\" and sell their own items, it promises to be an event.<br /><br />The customers start coming before dawn.  Among the first is local antiques dealer Gordon McCoy.  Always out to make a quick buck, no one trusts him.  Sure enough, he's quickly hording treasures in the barn to check out later, even though the barn is off limits because of the owls nesting there.  But when a customer drags a trunk out of the barn, Gordon's body is locked inside.  The police quickly zero in on one of Michael's fellow professors since he was seen wandering around the sale with the murder weapon.  Since Meg is trying to win the man over as a friend, she sets out to make sure the police have a better suspect.  With the yard sale temporarily on hold while the police investigate, Meg is able to dive in, especially since the crowd, suspects included, seem to be staying around the house hoping the sale will reopen.  Can Meg deal with the restless crowd and solve the murder?<br /><br />With each book, I fall further in love with this series.  I giggled and laughed my way through this entry.  There are several funny sub-plots that weave their way through the book, and I think there are a larger then normal assortment of relatives, adding to the general wackiness.  The mains storyline is handled well with some nice development the entire way through.<br /><br />Donna Andrews proves with each new book that she is at the top of her game.  I can't wait to see what she does next.	2005-04-07

She's to go undercover to Senator Flynn's estate on the Hudson River.  Posing as his cousin recently arrived from Ireland, she's to investigate the two spiritualists that the Senator's wife Theresa has hired to help her contact their son, who was killed in a kidnapping gone bad five years ago.  When a woman falsely accused by reputation in the crime asks Molly to look into that, too, Molly agrees.  But has she really learned enough about being an investigator to solve the two cases?<br /><br />I made a discovery when I started this book.  I truly love Molly and her friends.  I hadn't realized how much I'd come to love them before this.  Having said that, most of the action takes place outside of New York, so we really get Molly interacting with an entire new set of characters.  The plot to this book in multi-layered, with two mysteries and several other sub-plots weaving nicely throughout.  I found I had a hard time putting it down.  I was disappointed that a couple key plot points on the mysteries seemed to happen by coincidence, but on the whole, it wasn't a major problem.<br /><br />Ms. Bowen has written yet another engaging mystery that will please her fans.  And if you haven't discovered her wonderful books yet, but all means pick one up.  Either series will entertain and bring you back for more.	2005-04-03

Like a Mystery	When Miss Bennett's herb collection accidentally gets destroyed in class on a Friday, Trixie decides to head to the nearby marsh to start a new one for her.  So early Saturday morning, she and Honey set out.  On the way, they find the old ruins of the Martin mansion and have a run-in with Miss Rachel, the only Martin left.  But when they return, they find out that the young violin prodigy staying with them is missing.  Where can she be?  Throw in a biased newspaper reporter who takes a dislike to the Bob-Whites, and you've got plenty of trouble.<br /><br />What you don't have is a good mystery.  Calling this the Marshland Adventure might be much more accurate.  The first time I read it, I kept waiting for the mystery to start, and was rather disappointed.  I still haven't quite gotten over that, even though I can now appreciate the good character interaction and great setting.  And there is quite a warning in this book about the dangers of journalistic power that will make anyone as mad as it does Trixie.<br /><br />Obviously, this isn't a favorite in the series and isn't a good introduction to these wonderful characters.  I'm sure if it weren't for the case of false advertising, I wouldn't have been quite as disappointed with it as I was all those years ago.	2005-03-30

But that's especially true since Shawna opened the Magnolia Blossom Bakery right across the street from Hannah's own shop.  Business is looking pretty poor, and if things don't change soon, Hannah and Lisa might have to close their doors.<br /><br />On a happier note, Lisa and Herb's wedding day has finally arrived.  So what if Shawna Lee has promised to bring her famous peach cobbler to the reception.  It's only a minor dark cloud on an otherwise bright day.  But Shawna Lee never makes it to the reception.  Running by the bakeries afterward, Hannah finds Shawna Lee's dead body.  With one of the best motives in town, Hannah knows she's got to act fast to make sure she doesn't wind up behind bars for a crime she didn't commit.  But with most of the town at the wedding, who could have committed the murder?<br /><br />Reading Sugar Cookie Murder, I thought to myself that Shawna Lee would make a great murder victim.  Obviously great minds think alike.  While the murder aspect starts out a little slowly, I really didn't mind because there was still plenty going on with these friends.  And once Hannah finds the body, things really begin to pick up.  Clues lead to a place I never would have imagined, but is absolute genius.<br /><br />Any fan of the series will be pleased with the latest entry.  If you aren't, I do recommend starting at the beginning since you really need to read them in order to gain the full appreciation of the characters.  I can't wait to visit with them again.	2005-03-25

Every time he tries to sleep, he sees the same events playing out again and again.  He must figure out why she jumped so that he can keep her from doing it again and get some sleep.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Steve has a baffling case of his own and actually calls on his dad for help.  Winston Brant, the publisher behind \\"Thrill Seeker\\" magazine has just been murdered.  By a knife in the chest while parachuting.  Obviously, this is a case that will take Mark's incredible powers of deduction.<br /><br />These two cases flow well together in the book.  Both were intriguing, and I found myself constantly trying to read \\"just a little bit more.\\"  As with the others in the series, the characters are spot on.  Some of their interaction in the first part was laugh out loud funny, especially for fans of the series.  There are a few character arcs taking place in these books, and I'm intrigued to see where they will go.  My problem came in the last quarter.  It really felt dragged out, like there was one plot twist too many.  Maybe that's because I guessed much of those pages early myself.<br /><br />Like the previous books, this was a fun, fast read.  If you're a mystery lover, you'll enjoy it.  If you'll a Diagnosis: Murder fan, you'll love it.	2005-03-18

And the best part is, Madeline, Wes, and Holly will finally get to be guests at one of their own parties.<br /><br />But the trouble starts before the plane leaves the ground.  Holly just got a threatening e-mail demanding to know the whereabouts of her husband.  Seems she's not as single as she said she was, and her high school prom date might be her husband as well.  It's a bit hazy.  Even so, she has no idea where this guy might be now.<br /><br />Thinking they'll put this tiny problem behind them for the weekend, they board their plane.  But when they arrive, they find a man waiting in Holly's room.  When the man later turns up dead, Madeline can't help but investigate.  After all, she's never been too good at relaxing.  Can she solve this mystery before they return to the mainland?  Will these events ruin the party?<br /><br />It's no secret that I look forward to each book in this fun series.  But when I saw the title, I was extra excited.  How could a book with a title like that be anything but fantastic?  And it didn't let me down.  Even with the change of location, on-going storylines are advanced, just a little slower then normal.  As always, the plot is inventive and fun.  I dare you to guess where this one leads before the end.  And party planner Madeline is a great host, narrating the tale with a breezy style that keeps your attention throughout.<br /><br />A small word of warning.  Because of on going storylines, the last couple books are spoiled.  This series is best read in order.  Believe me, that will be no chore at all.<br /><br />I've already booked my next Mad Bean Event.  It can't get here fast enough to make me happy.	2005-03-16

He has no recollection of the case that put him there.  Still, he figures that the best things to do is get back to work, so he finds a new office, hires a secretary, and does just that.<br /><br />See, Pete thinks he's a hardboiled PI in the very classic sense.  And the two dames in distress that come calling seem to need him.  One is looking for a missing lover.  The other wants proof that her husband is having an affair.  And while Pete has no clue what he's doing, his secretary, fortunately, does.  But will it be enough to get them both through this in one piece?<br /><br />I'm not familiar with the classic hardboiled detectives of the past, but the little I do know makes it obvious they were the inspiration for this hilarious tale.  It's rather obvious to us early on that Pete has amnesia and is delusional.  We keep getting clues about his past that put the pieces into place.  The mystery plot of the story is also done extremely well.  There were several nice twists up until the very end, when everything was wrapped up nice and neat.  And the humor!  I was laughing out loud the entire way through the book at the confusion of the other characters to Pete, his own confusion over literal interpretations, and his hilarious commentary on life.  It was right up my sense of humor.<br /><br />So why the four stars?  This book had foul language that I'm not used to running into in a book.  Lots and lots of it.  It seemed to get better as the book went along, which I appreciated.  There were also several cases of sexual innuendo I didn't care for and a sex scene that I skipped over but still could have done without.  I'm well aware this will not bother most people out there, but it bothered me and lowered my enjoyment of the book.  Since I'm the one rating it, I took that into account.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book enough to give the sequel a chance.  Here's hoping that it's as funny as this one was.as.	2005-03-12

It's a plea from Joseph Albacco who claims to have been falsely sentenced for murdering his wife on their first anniversary.  Facing a serious case of writer's block, Cece decides to investigate.  Even though it's been almost 50 years, she begins to pick up a few leads.  And the more she learns, the more convinced she is that the wrong person has been in jail all these years.  Finding another body only spurs her on and ups the stakes.<br /><br />Even though I'm a huge mystery fan, I'm really not familiar with Perry Mason or his creator.  But the title of the book caught my attention, and I just had to read it.  As the title promises, it's an enjoyable book.  The mystery was very well done.  I wasn't sure what was going on until the end.  The pacing was a little slow, with the sub-plots taking on too much prominence early on.  And Cece's love of vintage clothes was also a bit of a distraction, at least to this male reader.  Cece herself is a great character with flaws I recognized right off the bat.  I do have a complaint with the dialog.  The author has a habit of using quick back and forth with nothing to identify who says what.  I found myself getting lost along the way and having to reread a scene to make sure I knew what was being said.  A few tags sprinkled into the book would have helped greatly.<br /><br />Over all, this was an enjoyable book that I'm glad I read.  I'm looking forward to Cece's next case.	2005-03-01

Forced to rent her home to a wanna be actress, she's desperate for work.  When a friend suggests pet sitting, Kendra jumps at the idea and soon finds she enjoys it.  Things are looking up until she arrives at one house of find her client has returned early and been murdered.<br /><br />The police are quick to suspect her.  After all, the victim had been a client back when she was practicing law.  Feeling the heat, Kendra begins pocking around to find the killer herself.  Will the help of an attractive PI be enough to help her solve the case?<br /><br />This book sounded like fun, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my hopes.  While Kendra has been through a lot, she comes across as whiney.  Even though she's willing to work hard to over come the obstacles, her \\"poor me\\" attitude was hard to over come.  The plot was fairly slow as well.  Often, I got board waiting for the next clue.  I'm not a big dog lover, but that would have made a difference.  It's obvious that the author loves dogs, and some of the canine characters are fun and bring life to the book.<br /><br />Dog lovers looking for a new cozy series will enjoy this book.  Others will be best entertained by looking elsewhere.	2005-02-26

Since I work with the Jr. High group at church, I figured I might find it helpful, so picked it up.  What I found was a thought provoking book on today's youth sub-culture.<br /><br />The book focuses most on high school students or mid-adolescents as the author calls them.  His premise is that adults have started abandoning kids early in life, making the transition from childhood to adulthood a longer and harder process.  Teens draw away from adults, not as much out of rebellion, but to cope.  The majority of this book is devoted to various aspects of teen life and how it develops and plays out.  Chapters such as Peers, School, Family, and Sports hit the nail on the head.  And I'll confess I found some shocking stuff in the chapters on Sex, Ethics, and the Party Scene.<br /><br />I did have some problems with this book.  At times, it seemed to go too far into the self-esteem trap.  Yes, we need to care for kids, but we also need to acknowledge that not everyone is created equal, something that seemed to be over looked at times.  Still, most his examples were of things going too far in the other direction, which makes his points very valid.<br /><br />Another area was the various ethics discussions.  While many of these chapters were eye opening for me, he never addressed ways to teach morals.  In fact, he seems to blame adults for problems such as cheating but never blames the kids or discuss how the problem should be addressed.<br /><br />The last two chapters are a discussion of ways to solve the problem of abandonment, but they seem to be impractical and fall short.  City wide meetings for everyone involved with youth?  What we really need is a radical shift in our entire culture.  Not that I'm exactly sure how to go about doing that, either.  So I'm probably little better then he is.<br /><br />On the whole, this book is an eye-opener about the problems today's high schoolers face.  While not perfect, it should be read by anyone who cares about today's teens.  Maybe then we can come up with workable solutions to let them know we do care., it should be read by anyone who cares about today's teens.  Maybe then we can come up with workable solutions to let them know we do care.	2005-02-25

It's been almost 10 years since then, and I still love this strip.<br /><br />This book collects 2 years worth of strips into one book.  These strips were previous released as \\"Your Momma Thinks Square Roots are Vegetables,\\" \\"Who's Up for Some Bonding?\\" and \\"Am I a Mutant, or What!\\"<br /><br />What I appreciate is that Bill Amend is still able to find the humor in situations we already know.  After all, has anything changed in this family since the strip started?  Nope.  Yet I found myself smiling, giggling, and laughing my way through this wonderful collection.<br /><br />As always, current culture and daily life are offered up with humor and satire.  I've always been a sucker for Jason's over the top reactions to movies, and here we get the first two Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, Star Wars Episode II, and Harry Potter.  That week in particular is funny with the inclusion of Eileen into the mix.  On the home front, we get Peter listening to \\"The Odyssey\\" in his sleep, Rodger making a trip to Costclub for Halloween candy, Peter getting sick right before Thanksgiving, and Paige getting an autographed picture of the Backsync Boys.<br /><br />Truly great comic strips seem to be hard to find these days, so I really treasure the ones I find.  This is one of the best and will entertain anyone looking to laugh at themselves and our culture.	2005-02-05

Callie's latest client is Shayna.  When Shayna calls that afternoon, she's upset because her boyfriend, Eddie, is missing.  When they do find Eddie, he's dead in the trunk of Shayna's car.  Now Callie's unexpected week off has become quite full.  With the police naturally focusing their attention on Shayna, Callie must find evidence that proves this young woman is innocent.  When she does find something, it leads her to something she never would have imagined, and more danger then she can handle alone.  Meanwhile, Callie is also investigating a national non-profit that claims it will help Advancing Attire expand its office space. And she' trying to deal with disappointment from not getting to meet her mysterious boss, Tom.<br /><br />Like the first book, this one starts slow.  It steadily gains speed and by the climax, it's impossible to put down.  Even before then, the writing style draws the reader in and makes it easy to get caught up in the story and sub-plots.  Callie really grows in this book as she is forced to face the isolation she's placed herself in after the death of her husband.  And, while I saw the final scene coming long before I got there, I couldn't help but smile as I read it.<br /><br />I am quite taken with this series and will be reading book three as soon as I can get my hands on it.	2005-01-29

It's after he recognizes the voice that he knows it was Brother Phillip giving him a strange cry for help.  But what did the message mean?<br /><br />Convincing his family and friends to head to New York on their Thanksgiving break was only the first part of the battle.  Arriving on the scene, Ricky quickly discovers that Brother Phillip died in a fire at his mission.  But the fire was before the phone call.  What could it mean?  And when Brother Phillip shows up that night, Ricky's even more confused.  The more he investigates, the more the tangled web gets.  Can Ricky and his friends cut through the blackmail, arson, and greed to figure out the truth?<br /><br />First, a word of warning.  This is the only book in the series that is a true sequel.  You need to read LOST BENEATH MANHATTAN first to fully understand this book.  Many of those characters are back for this book.<br /><br />Having gotten that out of the way, this book is incredible!  The clues are so well hidden, even knowing where they were, I missed a couple of them.  The plot moves quickly, weaving such a tangled web it's hard to believe things will work out for anyone.<br /><br />There does seem to be a bit of an editing problem near the beginning between this book and the original edition, but it's minor.  And once the story gets going, hold on!	2005-01-22

The girl's mother is quick to blame her husband, who might be planning to return to his native Russia.  Couple that with the girl's recent heart transplant and Evan knows the pressure is on to find her before time runs out.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Evan is restoring a cottage in Llanfair to move into after he and Bronwen get married.  While digging a trench, he finds the skeleton of another girl.  Evan quickly guesses it was a girl he knew who disappeared 25 years ago.  Are the two cases connected?<br /><br />This is another excellent entry in the series.  The plot was well constructed to fool the reader.  While I figured things out before Evan, it wasn't much before, and that was based on some lucky guesses.  While there is plenty of time spent outside Llanfair, its home base in this book, and we get some very humorous scenes with the locals we've gotten to know over the last few books.<br /><br />I'm disappointed to be up to date on this series.  I've always enjoyed having a pile of these books to look forward to reading.  I can't wait until the next book in this fun series coming out.	2005-01-15

Chronicles, Book 3)	Books	5	21	21	N	N	Gripping Personal Drama	Once again, the Thoenes transport us back to the first century and the Earthly ministry of Yeshua.  While His disciples and other followers debate how and when He will declare Himself as the king of the Jews, Manaen struggles with his sudden blindness.  Will his bitterness destroy his new life with Susanna?  In Caesarea Philippi, the rabbi's oldest daughter longs for love as she awaits the Messiah's coming.  And flute maker Alexander struggles with dealing with the death of his wife and raising his possessed son alone.  Is there any hope from the God his fathers rejected?  While these stories are playing out, Herod makes another bid to destroy this threat to his throne.<br /><br />This series is such a departure from the political intrigue that made them popular originally.  These personal dramas are just as compelling, however.  Even when I knew how these stories would end, I couldn't put the book down until I had finished.  Once again, their portrait of Yeshua as a personal friend to all who meet Him is touching.  And they certainly present some ideas to think about as well.<br /><br />While I'd like them to get back to 1948 Israel, I'm enjoying this detour to 1st century Israel.  Bring on the next book, no matter when it's set.	2005-01-13

One after another, they are facing problems that they can't get out of.  Then the elephant comes along and helps them all.  But who will help him when he needs it?<br /><br />This is a really a take on Aesop's classic story of the lion and the mouse with a few more creatures thrown in to show unthankfulness.  Still, this is a great book that kids will love.  The storyline is simple enough for them to follow easily, and Bill Peet's illustrations are outstanding.<br /><br />With good stories and wonderful pictures, Bill Peet created some excellent picture books.  Don't let this great author pass you by.	2005-01-09

Looks like Aaron was electrocuted when water spilled on the chord of an electric potter's wheel he was using.  The police are quick to rule it an accident, but Harrison isn't so sure.  Especially when his other tenants keep telling him that Aaron hated electric potter's wheels.  With the small police force being struck down by the flue, Harrison starts investigating.  Meanwhile, his choice of a replacement tenant causes hard feelings and tensions to rise around the complex.  Will Harrison be able to keep the peace, solve the murder, and run his shop?<br /><br />I loved the debut in this series and have been looking forward to this book since February.  I was disappointed because this book was a very poor follow-up.  The mystery was so poorly plotted that it felt like an after thought.  And the climax left me with too many questions.  The redeeming factor of the book is the main character.  I really identify with Harrison and enjoy spending time with him.<br /><br />I sure hope the mystery in the next book is better.  I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't.	2004-12-23

Still, she's shocked when she finds a charge on the account.  When she finds the order is going to an empty house, she sends Tim out to see who shows up.  Unfortunately, Tim falls asleep on his stake out and wakes up to find the police accusing him of a murder that occurred while he was out.  With the stakes raised, Turing, Maude, and Tim spring into action.  But can they solve the puzzle?  Is there more here then simple credit card fraud?  Was Garcia a victim even though he doesn't fit the pattern?  And will they give away Turing's secret with all their on-line snooping?<br /><br />I loved this book!  It drew me in from page one and I had a hard time putting it down until I was finished.  Turing, though an AIP, is a very real character.  The sub-plot dealing with her relationships with her human friends is very well done.  The mystery plot is deftly handled as well, and I couldn't wait to see where things were going.  The ending left me intrigued and I'm already impatient for the next in the series.<br /><br />This is not your normal cozy series because it includes a strong hi tech/sci-fi element.  But for anyone looking for something different, this is a great place to start.  Just be sure you read them in order starting with YOU'VE GOT MURDER because this series builds on each other big time, both in character interaction and plot.  This book will spoil the first two for you by necessity.	2004-12-18

He plans to make a movie based on the book Maia Michaelson wrote on her family history.<br /><br />But Lee McKinney suspects something isn't right from the start.  Aubrey seems too smooth and too good to be true.  She seems to be the only one to realize this, however.  Even her Aunt Nettie has agreed to go out on a date with him.  With no one willing to listen to her, Lee sets out to find out what she can about Aubrey by herself.  But she's hardly started when she finds a dead body.  What's the connection to the movie?  Can Lee stay alive long enough to find out?<br /><br />As with other books in the series, I loved this one and could hardly put it down.  Lee and her friends are wonderful characters that continue to grow on you.  While I had a couple of the sub-plots figured out early on, the main mystery surprised me from the get go.  I couldn't figure out for sure what was going on until Lee solved the case, even when the final clue was given.<br /><br />Warner Pier is a great place to visit and Lee is a great tour guide.  My only disappointment is that I'm done and have to wait for the next book to come out to visit again.	2004-12-11

She's the wife of a congressman and demands a pass to visit her twin sister across the line.  Grant reluctantly agrees, but regrets his decision when the Confederates attack the next morning.  In the aftermath of the bloody battle, not a trace can be found of either woman.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Harrison Raines and Jacques Tantou are returning from New Mexico.  Harry insists on going through New Orleans to follow up on a bit of information he got on Louis Devereux to try to quiet his mind about the loyalties of this beautiful actress.  What happens there sends them up the Mississippi and across the path of Grant.  Suddenly Harry finds himself on a quest to solve the mystery of what happened to the sisters to prove his loyalty to the Union.<br /><br />Like the last book in this series, it starts out very slow.  In fact, the first 50 pages of Harry could be cut out without missing anything critical to the story.  Even when his story gets interesting, he behaves in such a stupid manner it was driving me crazy.  The second half returned to the good plotting of the first few books in the series.  Here there was plenty of excitement and I felt like the book was actually getting somewhere.  Plus Harry grows a brain and starts acting like a grown up and not a teenager.  And the ending has such a nice wrap-up, I wonder if we will have more in the series or not.  Once again, the setting and real events of the time come to life.  The author has spent lots of time researching the time period and it shows.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd probably give the book a 3.5 rating, rounding up to four to be generous.  Fans of the series will want to read it, but new comers won't care about the characters enough to continue to the real meat of the story, the second half.	2004-12-08

There's just one problem.  Someone's been stealing Uncle Andrew's sheep.  Determined to help out her favorite uncle, Trixie starts looking for clues.  What about the sinister looking man she saw across the field?  Or how about the light in the uninhabited woods?<br /><br />This was one of the early books I read when I first discovered the series, and it still holds a special place in my heart.  Even so, I hate books were it feels like no one believes Trixie or takes her at all seriously.  Of course, she makes some embarrassing blunders, which doesn't help either.  But my biggest problem is the author's habit of telling the story through dialog as much as possible.  It gets annoying after a couple chapters.<br /><br />The last third of this book is a classic exciting scene that I still love.  While not the strongest book in the series, it does have a fun adventures.  And Trixie/Jim fans certainly won't want to miss the end.	2004-12-07

These are broken down into region and each colony given as much room as needed.  The last part of the book covers the events that led to the Revolutionary period, including the various wars with France.<br /><br />In between, however, it breaks colonial life down by topic and explores each thoroughly.  In several chapters, we get information on various aspects of the economic situation, immigration, social life and structure, law and order, and intellectual life.  By the time you are done with this book, you'll have a very good understanding on how American culture developed as it did in the early years and how this led to the America we know today.  And the back in full of reference material for further study.<br /><br />Naturally, as a textbook, it's rather dry at times.  But it's worthy reading if you have an interest in this period of American history.	2004-12-04

With a winter storm blowing outside, everyone is inside enjoying all the delicious food and feeding the gossip mill about Martin Dubinski and his new wife, Brandi Wyen.  Seems the two got married when Martin was in Vegas and she's a dancer from the famous city.  Meanwhile, Andrea is finally off bed rest, and Hannah finally gets to meet her mom's new boyfriend.<br /><br />But when Hannah finds Brandi stabbed with her mother's antique cake knife, things take a turn for the worse.  With a full blown blizzard raging outside, everyone is trapped at the community center with the killer.  Hannah sets out to help Mike solve this crime while the trail is still fresh.  But can she do it without letting everyone else know what's going on?<br /><br />If you're a fan of this series, you need this book.  The series character's storylines take a step forward, and you won't want to miss what happens to them.  Plus, as always, there's a good mystery.  Personally, I didn't have it figured out before the end.<br /><br />This entry in the series is really only a novella.  The second half of the book features the recipes from the cookbook.  Naturally, there are a few awkward paragraphs listing the dishes, but everything mentioned makes an appearance in the back.  As with any cookbook, there are some wonderful sounding recipes and some that don't appeal to me (like the fish), but considering I bought the book for the mystery, I'm really not complaining.  (And a side note, there's an error on a recipe in this book as well.  For the Not So Swedish Meatballs, you really only need one 50 ounce can of cream of mushroom soup, which should be fairly obvious.)<br /><br />It was nice to pop in and visit these friends for the holidays.  I'm looking forward to seeing them again in a few months with the next book.	2004-12-04

Should she pursue him or stick with Noah, even with all the mixed signals?<br /><br />All this takes a back burner when SD-6 needs her for another mission.  She's off to Germany with Noah and new agent Lucy in tow to retrieve long lost notes from a Russian military innovator from World War II.  But the danger there is mild compared to what awaits her when she gets back.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this prequel novel because it reminded me a lot of the TV show with things happening on many fronts.  And it was confusing enough I didn't have it all pieced together until the end.  It did seem a little too long-winded in parts, but the action was so reminiscent of the TV show, it didn't bother me on the whole.<br /><br />These prequel novels continue to create a world unto their own while being faithful to the TV show.  I can't wait to see where Sydney goes next.	2004-11-21

When Elizabeth arrives early, she finds the family propensity for eccentricity hasn't slowed down a bit.  But reconnecting with family takes a dangerous turn when a body is discovered.  When the death is ruled murder, no one in the house is above suspicion.<br /><br />I'd heard good things about Sharyn's books, so picked this up with much anticipation.  I was very disappointed in it, however.  This is really more a cultural farce then a mystery, but not being from the South, I didn't get it.  The mystery proceeds through fits and starts, with very little several pieces being left dangling at the end.  And the characters were too over the top to be believable.<br /><br />I've heard that this author's books improve as she progresses, so I might give her another try in the future.

Along with her daughter Jenna, she's visiting her mother and checking out locations for a fall foliage tour next year.  Her mother is renovating the house she just bought looking to turn it into a bed and breakfast.  But on their first morning there, the workman discovers human bones cemented in the basement.  Who was buried there?  When?  And most importantly, why?  Meanwhile, Lynne thinks her mom may be in over her head with the financing and running of a bed and breakfast.<br /><br />This series is always part adventure (very little clue following here) and part travel log.  This book seems to err on the side of travel log, especially at the end.  It really could have been written tighter.  And I was disappointed in that a couple sub-plots were wrapped up almost as after thoughts.  On the other hand, the series has a very inviting writing style, and it's easy to tag along on the adventure.  I was especially glad to see a different side of Lynne.  She was more relaxed here, and watching her interact with family instead of clients provided a different side of her.<br /><br />This series is a good vacation read.  Some light murder and mayhem mixed in with some interesting information about the area the book is set.	2004-11-11

So it will be hard work painting his new house.  But they'll be doing it next to the beach.  What could be better?  So Joel going along wasn't in the original plan.  Things could be worse, right?<br /><br />But within hours of them landing, Uncle Carl is meeting a mysterious man on the beach taking a brown paper sack full of money.  Then there's the neighbor lady who spends all her time burring cat litter on the cliffs.  And Ricky thinks he may have stumbled on a clue to a long buried pirate treasure.  It's not until Ralphy, Joel, and Carl vanish that the gang realizes what trouble they are truly in.<br /><br />I had forgotten most of the details of this book from the first time I read it years ago, so I had as much fun as the first time.  This is a cleverly plotted book with clues in very plain site.  I still couldn't remember what they all meant and how Ricky put everything together.  And there's still plenty of time for laughs, too, with two of the funniest scenes from the series.<br /><br />I just can't praise this series enough.  It's got great stories with fun characters and some nice themes slipped in, too.  Everyone should read them.	2004-11-11

But when Wendell Smythe says that it's only a loan to Feed the Need and not a gift, Callie finds herself with an hour's paperwork to do.  Returning to his office with the proper forms all filled out, she finds Wendell dead.  The police quickly rule it a murder and ask Callie to stay in town as a material witness.  Then Tom asks Callie to investigate.  And how can she turn her boss down?<br /><br />Staying with the Smythes gives Callie easy access to her prime suspects.  But beneath the surface of a seemingly happy family lurks some sinister secrets.  Who is leaving threatening messages for Sidra?  What drove Sidra and Derek apart?  What was going on at the company?  And does this have anything to do with the murder?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Callie is finding her own emotions hard to deal with.  Being around this much sadness and death is reminding her too much of the death of her own husband.  Can God help her deal with her own renewed emotions and solve the case?<br /><br />The titles of this series really intrigued me, so I decided to give the first a try.  It was certainly worth it.  Callie was a very human character and I found myself chocking up on more then one occasion with the hurt she was going through.  She's also strong and fun to hang out with.  While the story started a little slow, it gained speed quickly.  The twists came so fast in the final 100 pages I stayed up much later then was wise to finish.  I never saw the ending coming, either.<br /><br />If the rest of the series is this good, I can't wait to read it.  The author has won herself a new fan.	2004-10-28

And yes, I've even been buying the new editions.  The first three books are great and really set the series in motion.<br /><br />Up first is THE SECRET OF THE MANSION.  In it, Trixie meets Honey and they find a runaway in the neighborhood.  But can they keep his presence a secret and help him find his inheritance?<br /><br />Next comes THE RED TRAILER MYSTERY.  Trixie, Honey, and Miss Trask are off to track down a runaway heir.  If they don't get distracted by trailer thieves and a mysterious family along the way.  Trust me; you'll want to have this one handy when finishing the first book.<br /><br />The last in this set is my favorite in the series, THE GATEHOUSE MYSTERY.  When Trixie and Honey find a diamond in Honey's gatehouse, they decide to keep it and figure out how it got there.  But things get complicated when Trixie thinks it was stolen and the thief is still in the area.<br /><br />All three of these books provide plenty of action and fun while introducing the characters for the rest of the series.  In fact, the characters are introduced slowly enough to really make them stand out.  Trixie and Honey are a little annoying in the first book, but they soon rub off on each other and are much nicer by the end of book one.<br /><br />I continue to reread and enjoy these books to this day.  The slip case will help keep them in great shape.  Get this set today and make some great new friends.	2004-10-19

But things are not all roses.  Peter Fox, the reason she stayed, is withdrawing.  He especially clams up when the subject of the recent burglaries in the area come up.  Could he have returned to his former life of crime?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Grace has joined the local theater company's version of \\"The Vampyre\\" as a technical consultant.  The rehearsals don't seem to be progressing too smoothly, and the accidents happening to the cast don't help.  Couple that with the rumor of a real vampire in the area, and this will be an October few will forget.<br /><br />Having enjoyed the first in the series, I was looking forward to reading this one as well.  While it didn't start with quite the bang the first one did, it gained momentum quickly and by the end, I was staying up way to late to read \\"just a little more.\\"  Grace and Peter are great lead characters.  They are sufficiently complex and likable, making it easy to root for them to solve the current problems.<br /><br />This series is wonderful for anyone looking for a puzzling adventure.  You really should read the first book first (High Rhymes and Misdemeanors) to get the complete background on the characters.  Personally, I'm already counting the days until the third comes out.	2004-10-05

She's got a great cover, spoiled rich girl who loves horses.  And Noah comes along as her servant.  The goal is to get friendly with Melanie Lawton to learn what they can about her father, who SD-6 suspects of supporting terrorists.  But Miles suspects they are up to something.  Can Sydney and Noah figure up what he's up to and get home alive?<br /><br />They may have had trouble figuring out what Miles was up to, but I guessed it right away.  Still, this was a good book that was lots of fun to read.  Sydney and Noah's relationship continues to be tested.  It's interesting watching them now knowing what happens to them in the future.  I also enjoyed the irony of father daughter relationships in this book.  And the way the second half kept going, I was up later then I had intended reading \\"just a little bit more.\\"<br /><br />These books continue to entertain and give more insight into one of my favorite series.  Bring on the next one!	2004-09-30

This is just the kind of excitement that his doctor told him to stay away from.  The sheriff is determined to call it a suicide, so Fred worms his way into the investigation, getting the woman's long lost sister involved against her will.  But the more he and Kate investigate, the more questions they seem to have.  Can they uncover the secret that got Joan murdered?<br /><br />The idea of an elderly sleuth appealed to me, and I was quick to grab this book.  I wasn't disappointed.  Fred is a charming character.  I especially loved the way he was able to talk people into doing what he wanted sometimes.  And you can't help be feel sorry for him whenever everyone gangs up on his health.  Kate was an interesting character as well full of so many contradictions you couldn't figure her out.  The plot itself is great as well.  While I saw a few of the twists coming, there were still plenty of surprises for me and I couldn't wait to reach the suspenseful end.<br /><br />Sadly this series is out of print.  Don't let it stop you from meeting a charming character.  I'll be hunting down the rest of this great series so I can see what happens next to Fred.	2004-09-28
516980:US	52868156	R2PL4VE371VWY4	0553286447	287368783	Stalking the Angel (Elvis Cole, Book 2)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Elvis on the Case of the Missing Manuscript	When Bradley Warren saunters into Elvis's office, the two men clash from the beginning.  But Elvis still takes his case.  Seems a rare and valuable manuscript from Japan that Bradley borrowed has gone missing and Bradley feels the police aren't doing enough to find it.  Elvis soon picks up a trail that leads him to the underside of Little Tokyo.  But when the Warren family begins receiving threatening phone calls, the heat really picks up.  Can Elvis keep the family safe and find the manuscript?<br /><br />Ok, I admit, I'm not much of a hardboiled fan.  But something about this series intrigues me.  Probably the fact that the main character is more passionate about Disney then I am.  And I really do love Elvis.  His sarcasm and quips had me laughing throughout the entire book.  However, it's not all fun and games.  The further you go, the darker it gets.  That's probably my big complaint; it just got too dark for my personal tastes.  On the whole, it's a great storyline that keeps you reading until the final page with a couple nice twists.  And all the characters are interesting and very real.<br /><br />I certainly recommend this book to fans of hardboiled PI's.  It's very well written and engaging.  Frankly, even though I'm not a fan of this sub-genre, I'm thinking I may need to continue with these characters myself.  They're that intriguing.	2004-09-19

Cartoonist Bill Watterson chose to retire before he drained all the magic out of his characters.  While I'm disappointed, that is probably wise since this collection shows he was still at the top of his game.<br /><br />Calvin can make an adventure out of everything, whether it's having Susie over for an afternoon (a great day for GROSS), trying to get out of school, playing Calvinball with Rosalyn, or putting off a leaf collection project until the very last night, his antics are sure to make you laugh.  The genius of the strip is that we're often laughing at ourselves.  Hobbes's comments are often funny and true, and watch out for the Chewing magazine strips.  They hit a little too close to home.<br /><br />This strip got better as it went along, and there is some classic stuff here.  It's a little bitter sweet reading the last few knowing it's the end.  And I still want to know what the noodles incident was.<br /><br />While there are some strips out there I enjoy, I still miss this great strip.  If you somehow managed to miss it, pick up any book today.  It's guaranteed to have you laughing in no time.	2004-09-14

She's had to come in early to accommodate her most demanding customer.  But when Bertha Kravitz falls over poisoned, Marla's day just gets worse.  Naturally, since Marla was alone with the victim, she's the prime suspect.  Little do the police know that Marla had a very good motive.  Now she must find the real killer and keep her past a secret from the very attractive Detective Vail.<br /><br />This book was a mixed bag.  I found Marla full of spunk and really enjoyed her.  The plot twisted very nicely and I couldn't figure out who done it until the very end.  However, the book also had some serious flaws.  Detective Vail kept behaving in an unrealistic manner.  I doubt any police detective would treat their prime suspect the way he did Marla without being fired.  While I liked the fact that Marla had a past, I felt beat over the head with it since it seemed to be mentioned every few pages.  Finally, the book felt overwritten, with too much description at times slowing down certain scenes.<br /><br />Part of my problem might have been my gender; women might enjoy it more then I did.  It wasn't a bad book; a good edit could have fixed most of the problems.  Hopefully the series gets better as the author learns her craft.	2004-09-04

He's talked to the adults about it, but Trixie is dying to know what's going on.<br /><br />That's pushed to the back burner when a new kid shows up in school.  Dan is living with Mr. Maypenny.  Is he a long lost relative?  Then things seem to be disappearing around Glen Road and some of the clues point to Dan while others don't.  Can Trixie figure it out?<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, the Bob-Whites are putting on an ice carnival and a catamount is on the loose in the preserve.<br /><br />There's plenty of action in this book that will keep any reader entertained.  The mystery is very good, too, with so much conflicting information.  I remember being really confused the first time I read it.  True, there are a few series continuity errors, but they're minor and it's easy to get caught up in the story with Trixie and her friends.<br /><br />The climax from this book is one of my favorites in the series.  And the book has some great characterizations in it.  This book is a decent introduction to the series, although it's best to read them in order.	2004-09-02

When his boss offers him time off, he and his fiancee Bronwen decide to go visit each other's family.<br /><br />They've hardly arrived at Mrs. Evans in Swansea before they get the news.  The young man who killed Evan's father years ago has just been arrested for another murder.  Called into the hearing to keep him in jail without bail, Evan makes a startling discovery - he thinks the kid is innocent this time.  Now he must sneak around behind the backs of the police and his mother to find the real killer.  But will he alienate all those he loves as a result?<br /><br />Normally, I love this series.  It's a light, fun excursion to a part of the world I would love to visit.  This book was a disappointment, however.  The tone of the book is significantly darker then the others in the series, not providing the escape I was looking for.  The biggest problem is the plot.  It starts rather slowly and doesn't really get rolling until about a third of the way into the book.  Then, I had everything but the motive figured out about 80 pages before the end.  On the bright side, we get to see significantly more of Bronwen then normal, and her interaction with Evan is some of the best in the series.  She definitely needs more page time in future books.<br /><br />This book has some great moments and fans of the series will certainly enjoy it.  But if you're new to this great series, don't start here and don't judge the entire series by this book.	2004-08-28

But when Joel ruins what they think is their last chance, they are surprised to learn they've got the money they need.  As long as Joel can go along.  This doesn't exactly make Ricky happy, but he figures he can still enjoy the trip.<br /><br />What should be a fun trip becomes a nightmare when Joel gets lost in the middle of Manhattan.  When Ricky decides he is the only one who can rescue Joel, he and his friends will enter a world they don't even understand to track him down.<br /><br />This book starts out with one of the funniest scenes in the entire series.  I couldn't help laughing out loud at Joel's antics here.  But once the main story gets going, things get serious fast.  While there are a couple aspects of the plot that strain credibility, the story holds up well as a whole.  With the personal nature of the story, it's one of the most emotional books in the series.  And the ending is guaranteed to bring a smile back to your face.<br /><br />This series is guaranteed to entertain, and this book is no exception.  No matter what your age, if you want a great mystery with characters you'll grow to love, this is the series for you.	2004-08-15

Immediately responding to the scene, he finds two dead bodies.  Investigating further, he discovers that they've been dead longer then just a minute or two.  Only once Steve arrives does he find out that this is the producer husband of action star Lacey McClure and an unknown woman.  While she points her finger at the mob, Mark isn't so sure.  He thinks the killer has the perfect alibi and sets out to break it in spite of the intense media spot light.  Meanwhile, there's a new administrator at Community General, and he has set out to stop Mark's murder investigations, targeting Mark's friends.  Can Mark solve this murder without ruining not only his career but also the careers of those he cares about?<br /><br />Once again, Lee Goldberg has written a great mystery.  Just when you think everything's wrapped up and you wonder what more could happen, he changes everything around.  I was literally glued to the book for the last 50 pages.  I couldn't wait to see how everything was going to come out.  The characters continue to entertain, and I love the fact that Lee's continued from his days on the show by including Susan.  She makes a great fifth to the group.<br /><br />This novel is a continuation of the TV show in every way you could hope for.  We've got the characters we know and love in some excellent mystery plots.  If you were at all a fan of the show, don't hesitate.  And if you aren't familiar with the show but love a good mystery, pick these up as well.  You won't be disappointed.	2004-08-13

On her first day, she's sent to investigate a missing husband. She's sure he just spent the night with someone else, until his body turns up in the water with a bullet hole in his head. He doesn't seem to have any enemies. Furthermore, why would anyone want to kill a man on vacation?<br /><br />When I read the first in the series, I complained about the characters. This time around, the characters seemed better, but the plot left much to be desired. It started off pretty slowly with some irrelevant things.  There were two main sub-plots, one was under-developed and the other was over-developed and slowed down the main plot. In fact, it was just there to be preachy since the author admits at the end that it really isn't a problem in the BVI's. The main plot was enjoyable and had me confused for most of the book. I guessed the ending about 100 pages from the end and had to wait until Hannah could prove it to see if I was right. Even then, there was a twist I hadn't counted on.<br /><br />This sounds harsh, but I really did enjoy the main storyline, characters, and setting.  It's obvious the author loves the setting as she expertly brings the islands to life.  I'm ready to hop a ship and spend some time sailing around them myself.  This book is a great vacation read or a great read if you wish you were on an exotic vacation.  Hopefully the author will perfect her plotting while continuing to bring the islands and their secrets to life.	2004-08-09

SueEllen Kingsley wants a ghost writer for her party planning and recipe book and is willing to pay three thousand dollars a week.  Jaine soon finds that working for SueEllen is hardly worth the effort.  The woman is mean to all around her, especially her step-daughter.  After a few days, Jaine is ready to quit.  But when she arrives to resign, she finds her employer dead.  With the police focusing on the step-daughter, Jaine steps in to find the real killer.  Meanwhile, her parents are having another crisis.  Seems her father has bought a used toupee that looks horrid and insists on wearing it at all times.  Can Jaine help her mother from three thousand miles away?<br /><br />Having read the previous two books, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one.  I was once again rewarded with a hilarious book with a great mystery.  The plot left me plenty confused; I never would have guessed the killer.  Laura Levine is the queen of the one-liner.  I was laughing the entire way through the story.  The sub-plot with Jaine's parents just adds to the fun.  Jaine is charming and sympathetic heroine, and you can't help but root for her to solve the latest puzzle.<br /><br />If you have never met Jaine Austen before, you are in for a treat.  This is a wonderfully charming cozy series.  Once you get started, you'll want to read them all.	2004-08-06

When the idea hits reporter Jim Qwilleran, he thinks he's come up with the perfect way to win the Daily Fluxion's annual contest and some much needed money to get an apartment of his own. But when he gives the idea to his editor, he finds out that Junktown isn't a place for drug addicts but an area with a bunch of antique dealers. Qwill isn't excited about this any more, but his editor loves it and gives him the assignment.<br /><br /> Qwill's first day on the new beat is the day of an auction to sell off the merchandise of a dealer who recently died in an accident. Something about the accident makes Qwill's mustache tingle, however, and he begins to poke around. Soon, he's convinced that the man was really murdered. Unfortunately, Koko doesn't seem to be providing any help. But where does the cat keep disappearing to? And what's with the stuff that Koko and Yum Yum keep bringing to the apartment?<br /><br /> These books are very light mysteries, but when I'm in the mood for them, nothing else will hit the spot. I love following the antics of Koko and Yum Yum as Qwill tries to keep up. Being an early book in the long running series, Qwill is still a full time reporter. And the plot is much better developed. I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out who done it, and once I did how Koko would prove it. Along the way, I got to laugh at the cats' antics. They always make these stories so much more enjoyable.<br /><br /> When I do &quot;read&quot; these books, it's usually through these wonderful unabridged recordings. George Guidall is an excellent reader, and I can't picture anyone else doing these books justice. He brings all the characters to life and perfectly captures each &quot;Yowl&quot; of the cats.<br /><br /> While the later books seem to be going downhill, this series started off with some great mysteries. This is a perfect example. If you like your mysteries cozy, don't pass up this excellent series.	2004-08-04

SD-6 suspects that Viktor is smuggling items from country to country using the tour as a cover.  After an intense course in magic, Sydney's off.  Her new co-workers are fun, and Trevor is dreamy.  In fact, his attention makes Sydney struggle over her allegiance to Noah.  But as the case gets more complicated, Noah shows up to help.  Can Sydney put all the pieces together before one of the illusions becomes deadly?<br /><br />This book starts out with a bang.  It's probably the best action scene in any of the books, rivaling anything from the TV show.  As a result, I had high hopes for the book.  Unfortunately, it fell into all too familiar territory after that.  It was enjoyable, but I saw several plot points coming from miles away.  Some just screamed out at me.  Still, it wasn't a bad book, and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Sydney and Noah develop.  I've really enjoyed what they've done with Noah in these books, fleshing out the back story we were given in two episodes of the first season.<br /><br />With a cameo series fans will love and a jaw dropping, page turning opening, Alias fans will enjoy this book.  Anyone else will want to stir clear.	2004-08-03

But when Aunt Dahlia offers to let him stay with her, he thinks his problems are solved. Until he reads that day's paper. Seems he got engaged and no one bothered to tell him. Now he needs to straighten out this romantic entanglement. Meanwhile, one of the other guests at his aunt's might be a thief. A friend has just accidentally libeled someone. And her butler isn't who he claims to be. Jeeves might just have to cut his vacation short and help out his employer.<br /><br /> I remember reading a Jeeves short story in college and enjoying it. But I've never read any more of the books. Obviously, this was a mistake since I enjoyed this book so much. The characters are shallow, but they're supposed to be and that's where the entertainment comes in. This is showcased by the ending. While it felt a little short, it was also brilliant in its simplicity.<br /><br /> This book on tape is a great way to &quot;read&quot; the book. Ian Carmichael gives a fine performance, bringing the characters to life. Occasionally the dialogue is a little hard to follow since it was written to be read, but if you give it a few seconds, you can figure out what happened with no loss of the story.<br /><br /> If this is an example of the fun that the Jeeves stories are, I can't wait to read more of them. Don't miss out on this light-hearted, entertaining series.	2004-08-02

Mark Buchanan did, and out of it poured this book about moving beyond our ideas of God and getting to know the real God of the Bible.<br /><br />Many Christians get stuck in what he calls the Borderland, the land between salvation and sanctification.  The first half of the book goes into detail about the life in Borderland and what keeps us there.  Such things as pride, laziness, fear, doubt, self-reliance, and more are all looked at.<br /><br />The second half explores ways we can get to know the God of the Bible, who isn't safe and who might ask much of us.  But by getting to know Him, we move beyond the familiar into a rich spiritual life.  Mark doesn't go for something out of the ordinary here.  And there are no quick, sure answers.  Instead, he goes looks at familiar disciplines of the Christian life.  But he goes beyond the familiar and looks at why we do them and how they can affect our lives.<br /><br />This book is wonderful.  We get an honest look at the life of a Christian and the struggles involved.  It's filled with examples from life and the Bible to help explain its points.  And it's written in an easy to follow style.  Yet it's filled with so much, it's often hard to digest.  I'm already planning a reread there's so much here to chew on.<br /><br />The first half might have been a little long.  He had me convinced I needed the second part with the introduction.  Still, if you want to grow in your relationship with God, this is the book for you.	2004-07-29

This time she's working at Page Turners book store.  The job isn't as nice as she thought it would be, but she puts up with her womanizing boss, Page Turner III, because he's will to pay in cash.  Now, if only the rumors of the chain closing would go away, Helen might be able to relax.<br /><br />When her apartment is infested with termites, she doesn't mind the weekend at the beach with new boyfriend Dr. Rich.  But Helen returns to find Page Turner III dead in neighbor Peggy's bed.  There is no shortage of suspects, but the police center in on Peggy, soon arresting her.  Helen knows her friend couldn't have committed the murder, so she starts her own investigation.  The more she investigates, the more motive she uncovers for Peggy.  Can she find another motive and free her friend?<br /><br />I still have very mixed emotions about this series.  On one hand, I find Helen's plight down right depressing.  And, frankly, I also find it rather hard to believe she would let herself stay in the predicament for very long.  Furthermore, there seems to be a real anti-male theme going in this series, which rankles me.  On the other hand, I had a hard time putting the book down and was completely drawn into the mystery.  I was proud of myself for figuring out the killer before Helen even if I missed the clues along the way, so obviously I cared about the outcome.<br /><br />This series is advertised as a humorous series, but I don't get the black humor.  I'm compelled enough that I'll probably move on to the third when it comes out.  Helen may be depressing, but I can't seem to stay away from her adventures.	2004-07-26

Nora received the family farm just outside Philadelphia.  Unfortunately, with it comes a huge tax debt.  So Nora does what any young woman would do, she takes a job as a society reporter for a local paper.<br /><br />Nora has connections with the owner of the paper, which makes her new co-worker furious.  But that's minor after Nora finds the dead body of the owner.  Even with Rory's advanced age, the police quickly find evidence of murder.  When they start looking in what Nora feels is the wrong direction, she decides to investigate and find the real killer herself.  The more she pokes around, the more Nora learns about Rory's secret life and the more motives she finds.  Can she sort out the correct motive and solve the crime?<br /><br />I've been hearing about this series for some time, and finally got a chance to read it.  All the buzz I'd heard is well deserved.  This is a fun mystery with a charming heroine.  Her sisters are a hoot as well.  I look forward to getting to know all of them better in future books.  The story was well plotted and reached a logical conclusion.  The ending did seem a bit rushed to me, however.  My only other complaint is that Nora's reason for looking into this murder seemed a little shaky, but maybe I'm just being picky.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing what befalls Nora in her future adventures.	2004-07-23

The school has been hit by a string of petty vandalism and robbery, so the board has decided that secret societies will have to disband.  Fortunately, Trixie comes up with a plan to save their club.  To prove they are worthy, they decide to put on an antique show to benefit UNICEF.  Not only does this mean lots of hard work, but it means constant run-ins with thieves out to steal the valuable stuff for sale and display.  Now Trixie must track down the culprits in time to save the sale.<br />This book is the first book that series creator Julie Campbell didn't write and it shows.  There seems to be more of a conflict between Trixie and her family and friends about her detective work.  Still, this book has some of the best \\"fun\\" scenes of the series.  And it introduces the idea of the Bob-Whites doing charity events and their hangout Wimpy's, both staples in later books in the series.<br />When I was a kid, I totally bought the premise, but as an adult I realize just how out there it is.  Still, it does set up a decent if not nail biting story.  This qualifies more as an adventure rather then mystery, but it's still fun to read and I enjoy it.<br />While Julie Campbell's touch is missed, the series takes a decided leap into new territory with this fun adventure.  Another one sure to make fans out of any kid.	2004-07-15

Brad Putnam was quite interested in burial customs and Sweeney really liked him.  Naturally, she is quite upset when she learns of his death.<br />Brad was a member of a powerful and well known family in Boston whose influence goes back generations.  As Sweeney helps the police, she finds herself drawn into other aspects of the case.  Why was the jewelry left on Brad?  What was he so upset about the night he was killed?  And does it have anything to do with his research for her class?<br />I enjoyed Ms. Taylor's debut mystery and was looking forward to this book as well.  I wasn't disappointed.  Sweeney is as interesting a character as before, and I find her knowledge of burial and mourning customs fascinating.  The plot is well paced with clues and red herrings scattered throughout.  Since this book focuses on the past of only one family, I had an easier time keeping the historic characters straight this time around.  I must admit to being a little confused as to why one sub-plot was in the story, but it was an interesting balance to one of the characters.  The book is slightly darker then much of what I read, but I really enjoyed it for a change of pace.  The writing style in engaging, inviting the reader in and making it hard to put the book down.<br />With a fresh writing style, interesting main character with a unique interest, and intricate plot, this is a series not to be missed.	2004-07-12

This year's festivities have been enhanced by the addition of monkeys and parrots, which have escaped from their cages and are wandering the hotel at random.  Meg is hoping to make some money off her swords in the dealer room to keep the weekend from being a complete loss.<br />All that's before the star of the show is murdered.  Nicknamed the QB (which doesn't stand for Queen Bee), there isn't a person who works on the show who didn't have some beef with her.  Despite protests that she's not going to get involved, Meg begins collecting clues.  But can she follow them back to the real killer before the convention ends?<br />If you are at all familiar with the books in the Meg Langslow series, you know to expect plenty of antics along with your mystery.  This book is no exception.  Donna Andrews pokes gentle fun at fandom with some of the over the top antics.  I grinned and laughed my way through the entire book.  At the same time, there's a great mystery.  While it takes a while to get going, it is a cleverly plotted story with several nice twists before the ending.<br />Donna Andrews continues to set the bar high for herself.  How she manages to juggle everything she puts in these stories is beyond me.  But they are a fun ride none-the-less.  If you love humorous mysteries, be sure to check this series out.	2004-07-08

Bogart can't wait to break the story on her afternoon radio talk show.  After all, this is huge news, and the star's local Sacramento roots will make it a huge ratings boost.  And when the star, still claiming she's innocent, asks Shauna to meet with her, how can she say no?  This is the opportunity of a lifetime and then some.  The more Shauna learns about the story, the more she realizes that Jasmine's claims of innocence may be real after all.  Meanwhile, Shauna's new boyfriend Pete disappears while researching the history of some old records he got of a local doo-whap group.  What's he up to?  And can Shauna figure out who framed Jasmine and why?<br />I was impressed with Joyce Krieg's debut mystery, and I was hoping this book could live up to its predecessor's huge shoes.  I'm glad to say it did.  Once again we have an intricately plotted mystery with several nice twists to keep everyone confused.  The book felt like it was getting off track for a little while in the middle, but it all winds up being important in the end.  The climax has a radio personality's flair for the dramatic, which serves the story well.  The radio background is used to provide a nice setting without slowing down the story.  Personally, I find the setting fascinating.  And we have some interesting characters who we get to know a little better as they continue to grow.  I could actually hear their distinctive voices, something I don't normally hear when reading period.<br />I highly recommend this excellent series to anyone who enjoys a mystery with an interesting setting, real characters, and plenty of twists.  Is the next one out yet?	2004-07-08

All they have to do is poke around a little and find out what's happening and report back to the owner's sister who is worried about what he's not telling her.  This is their first time skiing, and they can't wait!<br />But within hours of their arrival, the building they're staying in catches fire.  That's when they start learning about the accidents.  And the ghost that everyone sees the night before the accidents occur.  Something certainly isn't right here, so Ricky and his friends go into action.  The answer may bring them more danger then they ever imaged possible.<br />This is yet another fun entry in a wonderful series.  The clues seem a little more obvious in this book then in some of the others.  That only hampers the enjoyment a little, however.  Joel is a riot, and there are plenty of laughs to go around before the tension increases.  The climax will have you turning pages as quickly as possible to find out how Ricky will get out of this mess.<br />These books are great for kids and adults alike.  They will entertain anyone who picks them up.	2004-06-30

There are reports of the rebels trying to take over a path all the way to the Pacific Ocean.  Their job is to find out what is happening and report back to the Secret Service.<br />But first they have to cross the desert.  The climate is nothing like either of the men have seen before.  When they find some time sensitive info, they split up.  When Harry finally arrives in Santa Fe, he finds the town in disarray and Boston arrested for one of the murders he's learned about.  Now he needs to find the truth to clear his friend and keep the west in Union hands.<br />I love this series because it brings the Civil War to life in a fascinating way.  This book, however, wasn't nearly as good as the others have been.  The plot dragged with too much time spent on Harrison's travels through the desert.  When the plot finally does get going, it seems rushed as a result, and I found myself struggling to keep up.  One thing I enjoy about the series is the developing storyline with the characters, but since only Harry and Boston were in this book, that aspect was absent as well.<br />I'm sorry to have to give this book such a low rating when the series is normally so great.  Hopefully the next book will be more on the level with the others.	2004-06-28

It's the annual Biking for Bucks charity race.  This is a big event in the city and Nancy and her friends are excited to be part of the two day event.  But that's before someone lets Ned's car roll into a creek and lets the air out of their bike tires.  But the worst is that the money pledged has been stolen.  Now Nancy needs to track down the missing money before the rest of the town finds out that the money is missing.<br />Having really enjoyed the first book of these relaunches, I decided to give the second a try.  Again, I enjoyed the characterizations.  This time, I felt the plot was lacking more then the first book.  Maybe it's because I'm older then the target audience, but I found the dual plots rather obvious.  And the bike ride made little to no sense, especially the race aspect of things.<br />Over all, I think young kids will enjoy these books, but the lack of decent mysteries will make older kids pass on them for the originals.	2004-06-22

She finally hires a young Chasidic girl from her neighborhood to baby sit for a couple hours each day.  But after the first day, the girl vanishes.  Against all reason, Juliet finds herself drawn to find this young woman, especially after her parents refuse to call the police.  But what could make her run away?  And can Juliet find her while juggling an infant, pre-school, and her husband's strange work schedule?<br />I enjoyed the first book in this series but felt it had some flaws.  This book was much stronger and the same flaws didn't plague this book.  It has a fun sense of humor, and while I felt Juliet complained a bit too much at times, I appreciated her love for her family which still came through.  The plot is better developed here, although why this woman would search for this girl is beyond me.  Even Juliet acknowledges that it doesn't make much sense.<br />I'm glad I've been collecting the paperbacks as they've come out.  I won't wait so long to revisit Juliet and her family.	2004-06-19

Their hopes are set on Di's Uncle Monty who has promised all of them a vacation to his dude ranch in Arizona.  But the trip almost doesn't come off.  Trixie needs to study to bring her grades up.  And when they arrive, Monty is having a crisis.  Seems most of his staff has vanished with no warning and no explanation during the busiest time of the year.  Where did they go?  The Bob-Whites agree to take over the chores, but with Trixie's studies, will she ever get to have any fun?  And that doesn't take into account the mysteries surrounding the other staff members and a few guests.  Will these distract Trixie from her studies?<br />This was the last book series creator Julie Campbell wrote.  It's not her best with lots of background on Arizona and Indian culture slowing the story down.  The mystery, once it does get going, focuses on what is going on in people's lives.  There are so many things happening I found it interesting even if it's not a traditional type mystery.  Spending time with Trixie and her friends is always enjoyable, and the efforts they go through to make Christmas enjoyable for all is entertaining as well.<br />This was the second book I read many years ago when I was first getting into the series.  While it's not up there with Julie Campbell's best, it's still and entertaining read that holds a special place in my heart.	2004-06-12

It's not until the fourth lawyer is found dead that the police begin to see a pattern.  Of course, the others were ruled as accidents or suicides.  But now it's as plain as day.  A serial killer is on the loose in LA killing off lawyers.  Not that the victims were innocent either.  It's fallen on Joanna Davis and her partner to lead the task force tracking down this fiend.  But he's good.  Almost too good.  With very little to go on and copycat killings to sort through, it looks hopeless.<br />This book is a combination of police procedural and serial killer, two sub-genres I tend to not read.  Even so, I was easily sucked in and entertained by this tightly plotted tale.  Ms. Cannon is a master of the multiple viewpoint story, and here she uses it to good effect to increase the tension.  Joanna herself is an interesting character, although one of her personal sub-plots could have been eliminated to make the story stronger.  The villain is an interesting and creative character as well.  I actually looked forward to his viewpoint almost as much as Joanna's.<br />Fans of this author's other books need not fear; the violence is kept well under control.  This is an entertaining mystery that will appeal to fans of many sub-genres.	2004-06-09

Town legend has long held that \\"Moth-Wallet\\" Bugsby buried a fortune in gold before he died, but no one has ever been able to find it.  Could this be a key to the long awaited treasure?  Ricky and his friends are determined to find out.  And, while they try to keep it quiet, news leaks out.  Now they seem to be racing half to town to find the gold.  Can they find it first?  And what might they learn about human nature, including their own, along the way?<br />This was my third time through the book, and I still couldn't remember all the clues.  Actually, about half way through I realized I no longer knew what would happen next.  This kept me entertained and guessing right along with Ricky.  And this is a fun book.  From the opening scene, you'll be hooked and entertained.  Joel seems funnier then normal here, and Ralphy's hiccup sub-plot adds to the humor.  Still, the ending leaves a sober impression of a Biblical truth.<br />It's no secret that I love Ricky Kidd and his friends.  This is another excellent example of why.	2004-06-01

With not too much time left, twin brother Clay arrives back in Seaside to try to rebuild his relationship with his brother, damaged because of Clay's attitude toward Ted's lifestyle choices.  Meanwhile, this causes a problem for Leigh Spenser.  While Ted is her best friend, she is holding a secret from Clay she's not sure if she wants exposed.  But with the threatening phone calls Leigh keeps getting, she may have no choice to turn to Clay for help.<br />I really wasn't sure what to expect when I started this book.  I couldn't decide if it was mystery or romance or something else entirely.  This is a dysfunctional family drama and romance that pulls you in from the very beginning.  While many of the major plot points are easily guessed early on, I had to keep reading to see how things would play out.  In fact, I stayed up way too late too many nights in a row to read just a little further.<br />Frankly, I don't see how Gayle Roper could have written this book.  The characters go through so much pain and heartache I could barely deal with it some times.  If that's how I felt reading it, I can only image what it was like to write.<br />Ms. Roper doesn't shy away from tackling such issues as homosexuality and premarital sex.  She handles them with honesty both in the consequences and what the Bible says.  It was refreshing to see in this novel things I've believed for years regarding sin and the forgiveness God offers to all sinners.<br />While not the type of book I would normally read, it really got to me.  I couldn't stop thinking about the characters and the themes even when I wasn't reading it.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-05-29

But outside a camp on the outskirts of DC, the body of the young abolitionist Anthony Fowler has been found.  Jones is surprised when he finds himself chosen specially by General McClellan to look into the matter.  McClellan is afraid this will be used to further inflame the new conflict between the states and possibly even make slavery an issue in the war.  The press is already blaming spies from the south, so Jones has an uphill battle to find the truth.<br />First, the bad.  Best I can tell from my little research, the author made a major historical blunder by his references to and descriptions of Thanksgiving in 1861 when I don't think it was celebrated.  If my research is correct, if it was celebrated at all, it wouldn't have been as big a deal until at least 1863, two years after the setting.  Finally, there is one chapter in the middle of the book that is devoted to the history of our character.  While the information on the Battle of Bull Run is interesting, his childhood, history of his relationship his wife, and his fighting for the British in India seemed to be completely irrelevant to the story told here.<br />There is much to like about this book, however.  While not what I was expecting by the heading \\"A novel of historical suspense,\\" I was completely taken in by the mystery.  There are some very well developed red herrings that confused me.  Abel Jones is a flawed character with no real idea what he's doing, as he points out numerous times.  I felt this was very realistic and refreshing.  I had some suspicions as to the murder, but wasn't completely sure until the end.  The book has a front porch storyteller first person narration style that draws you in and makes the book fun to read.  And the author does a fantastic job of bring both the good and bad of November 1861 to vivid life.<br />Despite my reservations, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the US Civil War.  I plan to check out Abel Jones' next adventure myself.recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the US Civil War.  I plan to check out Abel Jones' next adventure myself.	2004-05-29

Since K-Directorate is a dangerous rogue agency dedicated only to getting a profit, Sydney is more then willing to go, even if it means leaving for six weeks.<br />Once there, she discovers that things might not be so rosy.  One of her SD-9 contacts is burned out.  And watching Anna Espinosa single out an agent for the ultimate discipline her first day makes her wonder if she'll survive the six-week mission.  But suddenly, things begin to go wrong, and she has no choice but to see this mission to its completion, even if it means her life.<br />I've been enjoying these looks at Sydney's life as a spy before the show began.  Here, we get a mission plus the first of many meetings between Sydney and Anna.  (They really need to bring her back to the show!)  While the last few books have blown me away with character development, this one was a little lacking in that regard.  A couple of the plot twists seemed a little strange as well.  Still, it was an entertaining read that kept me turning pages to see how in the world Syd would make it home safe this time.<br />While not as outstanding as other books, this is still a fun read that will entertain any fan of the show.	2004-05-20

However, with the deadline looming, all &quot;Dr. A&quot; seems interested in is shopping day after day.<br />I love this series; it always feels like taking a vacation.  The characters seemed a little better developed this time around.  I had worried about this book, but the author managed to portray the reaction of the community to the witchcraft without offending this Christian.  The plot was a little disappointing to me, however, as it didn't seem quite as intricately plotted as normal for the series.  Still, it kept me interested and confused until the end.<br />This is the fourth book in a great series with a fun location.  This series isn't as progressive as some others I read, so pick up one today and enjoy a trip to a resort town.	2004-05-18

He has very bad news.  Their house has burned to the ground and their parents are dead.  To honor their father's wishes, they are sent to live with Count Olaf across town.  He treats them like slaves.  But that's just the beginning.  He also wants to take over their trust fund, and will stop at nothing to do so.<br />I really didn't know what to think about this series.  But some friends highly recommended it to me, so I decided to give it a try.  And I'm glad I did.  This book is rather dark for a kid's book, with lots of sarcasm and dark humor, as well as some tragic events.  It does require a certainly level of maturity to be appreciated by kids or adults.  I was really taken with the kids, however.  Violet and Klaus pull together and don't let anything stop them from trying to make the most of a bad situation.  I wish more people, including me, were like that.  And Sunny constantly made me smile with her sudden outbursts.  The set up of the plot was fairly obvious to me, but I didn't see the ending coming before it happened.  My only real complaint was the narrator's habit of interrupting a story to define a word that had just been used.  It got annoying seeing this on every few pages.<br />Take the warning on the back seriously.  These are dark books.  But they are certainly enjoyable as well.	2004-05-13

Caiaphas has joined forces with Herod to find a way to arrest or assassinate him.  In addition, Caiaphas has declared that all who claim Yeshua is Messiah will be put out of the synagogue.  Naturally, this has repercussions for chief shepherd Zadok.<br />It also affects Peniel, the once blind beggar Yeshua recently healed.  With a man hunt on for him in Jerusalem, he flees to Galilee in search of Yeshua.  He brings some friends who would like to be healed as well.  But they could find that Galilee is just as dangerous for them as Jerusalem was.<br />Meanwhile, the lepers in the Valley of Mak'ob are hearing rumors about a man who can heal.  Could they be true?  Should they look for him?  And what will this mean for Lily, a young woman afflicted for six years.<br />I am a fan of the Thoene's writing, eagerly awaiting each new book.  This book was disappointing for me, however.  Part of that is because I wasn't as interested in the characters the book followed most of the time.  I've always enjoyed the Thoene's books because of their deft blend of personal and political plot lines.  Right now, the series seems focused on personal stories.  While that's fine, we can usually guess the ending from page 1, and it makes the books drag.  Still, their characters are vivid as always, and the last 50 pages are wonderful reading.<br />Fans of this fine writing team will have to read this book to follow their latest series.  Just be forewarned that it's not the best they have to offer.	2004-05-12

Baby Wren has arrived, and Zoe and Hammie haven't quite figured out where they fit in the family any more.  Plus, they want everything to be fair for all three of them, even though they are growing and facing different things.  For example, Hammie is going to his first sleep over.  And if that isn't enough, Bunny is naming her identical twins identically.  Fortunately, Wanda and Darryl are facing life with a quip and sarcasm as always.<br />I've always loved this strip of its real if slightly exaggerated look at every day life in a loving family.  This set continues the grand tradition with more fun and laughter with this ever growing family.  Every page held a smile and chuckle, with many having laugh out loud moments.  Sometimes, they hit a little too close to home, but with some funny lines I appreciated.<br />If you need a humorous look at family life the way it really is, read this strip.  And if you already know and love the McPhersons, this book is exactly what you're looking for to get the next chapter in the life of this funny family.	2004-05-06

Leaving a cheating husband and professional scandal behind her, she accepts an offer from a friend to run his small antique shop in Carmel.  Her hopes to keep a low profile are dashed when a woman dies in her arms.  With the new police chief making her feel uncomfortable, she decides to follow up on the few clues she's stumbled upon.  Molly's only beginning to get a picture when another murder takes place.  Can Molly figure things out before she becomes the next victim?<br />I went into this book with high hopes.  I'd heard good things about it and it sounded like a fun story.  The plot is decent.  There are a few missteps and novice mistakes, but they didn't detract too much.  I did think the ending could have been written tighter, but that's a minor quibble.<br />My main complaint comes from the characters.  I was over half way though before I began to like any of them, even Molly.  All of them swore excessively.  I don't mind a little in the books I read, but this really seemed to go beyond what is necessarily.  And, they all smoked like a chimney.  Frankly, I found it unrealistic, distracting, and annoying.<br />If the characters were more likable, I'd forgive the mistakes in the plot and say read it.  As it is, I was ready for the book to be done long before it was.	2004-05-04

But when her friend Toby shows her a picture of a unique gravestone near his aunt and uncle, she can't resist investigating.  After all, it'll make a perfect chapter in her book on gravestones of New England.<br />The stone is located in an artist's colony in Vermont dating back to the late 1800's.  Rumor is that the young woman immortalized by that stone was murdered by one of the artists, but no arrests were ever made.<br />Even before Sweeney arrives, the woman's great-niece is murdered.  Ruth Kimball told Sweeney on the phone about the rumors.  Is there a connection between the gravestone, the mysterious death of 115 years ago, and the murder today?  If Sweeney wants the truth about this unique stone, she'll have to find out.<br />I was intrigued by the premise of this book when I first heard about it, but put off getting it.  That was a mistake.  This is a wonderfully written debut.  The descriptions make the colony come to vivid life.  The style is relaxed, inviting you to sit back and enjoy.  I did have problems keeping all the character and the relations to those from the past straight, but with some work I was able to figure it all out.  The plot was wonderful, giving us new information but keeping us in the dark until the end with plenty of clues and red herrings sprinkled throughout the book.<br />I've fallen under the spell of this author and series.  I can't wait for the next book to come out.  I highly recommend you pick up this excellent debut today.	2004-04-27

While on the plane, Joel manages to become friends with the giant of a man sitting next to him.  When the man is arrested as soon as they land, the Accidental Detectives learn that he's an ex-con, returning home from prison for murder.  The next day, Lisa, Ricky, and Joel are kidnapped and taken to a small island in a swamp.  Guarded by an alligator, they must figure out what their captors want and find a way to escape.<br />I read this book once several years ago, and I had forgotten just how intense it is.  Rereading it this week, I could hardly put it down.  The story moves from one predicament to another with hardly a chance to breath.  Naturally, I finished it fast to find out just what was going on and how the gang would get through this adventure safe and sound.<br />This is a thriller for kids, and any fan of action will love it.  With a couple good twists thrown in for good measure, it should please any one looking for a good read.	2004-04-22

She's an American working on her doctoral degree on psychic powers in the Celts.  After a few minutes conversation, she believes that Betsy, the barmaid, is a perfect candidate and takes her off to the Sacred Grove, a nearby New Age center, to be tested.<br />Constable Evan Evans, meanwhile, is trying to prove to himself and Bronwen that he can survive on his own and has moved across the street from Mrs. Williams.  At work, a search for a missing American college student takes him to the Sacred Grove.  Something doesn't feel right.  He doesn't believe in Betsy's new found powers, either.  Until she shows up at his house in the middle of the night claiming to have a vision - that leads to a very dead body.  Does Betsy have powers?  More importantly, who committed the murder?<br />I've come to rely on these books for a comforting trip to a simple village that holds lots of mystery and intrigue.  This book was no exception.  Ms. Bowen is still at the top of her game, with a book that twists all over the place.  I had no clue where this book was going until near the end, and couldn't put it down.  The characters are fun, and the numerous sub-plots keep things moving quickly.  I especially enjoyed Evans-the-Post and his new motorbike.  Naturally, Betsy gets developed quite a bit here, and it's nice to see one of the secondary characters get a bit of the spotlight.<br />If you enjoy a very charming setting and characters with intriguing plots, this series is for you.  Pick up the first, EVANS ABOVE, and sit back and enjoy.	2004-04-22

Someone has been smashing all the zucchini plants.  Is this a case of neighbors turning on each other, or is something else involved?<br />While investigating, Nancy meets Simone.  She's recently moved to River Heights.  When one of her family heirlooms is stolen, she asks Nancy for help.  But who would take something that had more sentimental then monetary value?<br />I must admit I was very curious when I heard about them updating Nancy Drew.  I'd read some of the books as a kid, and couldn't resist picking this book up.  Ultimately, I liked it.  Nancy, Bess, George, and Ned have been given more human make-overs.  They could turn into much more interesting characters here then they were in the originals.  And the first person narration was a nice touch.  I found the crimes a little too mundane compared to what Nancy used to investigate, but the plot was well done with several clues hidden throughout the book.  I picked up on some of them, but not all.<br />In the end, this updating is a winner.  Here's to the New Nancy staying around for quite some time.	2004-04-20

Bartholomew Cubbins, lowest of the subject of King Derwin has gone into town to sell some cranberries for his parents.  When the king passes by, he doffs his hat, only have the king stop and accuse him of not taking his hat off.  Surprised to find it is true, he takes his hat off, only to find a third hat on his head.  The king has him arrested and begins trying to figure out ways to keep the hat off.  His wise men and magicians are certainly no help.  Meanwhile, Bartholomew must figure out a way to get his hat to stay off his head before the consequences become drastic.<br />This is an early Dr. Seuss book, and a lesser known of his works.  Still, it tells a fun story about a boy in trouble for something he didn't do.  Everyone can relate to that.  Even when the king becomes obsessed with the hat, Bartholomew never looses his respect for the king.<br />This doesn't have the charm, creativity, or poetry of some of his other works, but is still fun for kids because of the absurd length they reach to try to get rid of that hat.	2004-04-15

The knife down his throat proved he was murdered.  But who was he and why was he killed?  Meanwhile, the god Amon is traveling up the river to meet with a tribal king bringing his son to be healed.  Bak would like to lead his mean in guarding the god on his journey, but first he must solve this crime.<br />I must admit to really being conflicted on this book.  There were so many mentions of previous crimes that Bak had solved, I was sure I was jumping in in the middle of the series.  Yet everywhere I've looked has led me to believe this is the first book.  It started out very slowly, and I was tempted to stop a time or two.  But I pressed on, and it got better as it went along.  I think part of my problem getting into the book was the strange character and place names.  Fortunately, there was a cast of characters and area map at the beginning I used for the first half of the novel to keep all those strange names straight.  By the end, I had come to like Bak and was drawn into his quest of find the killer.<br />I'm being generous and giving this four starts because I did enjoy the second half of the book, and I'll give the author another try.  Hopefully, later books in the series start stronger and are more enjoyable over all.	2004-04-14

The main plot for the entire series was mapped out before the show even started.  As a result, it developed a loyal fan base that still loves it.<br />This book is the fifth in a series of five episode guides to the series.  Covering the fifth season, it has a separate chapter for each of the twenty-two episodes.  Each starts with a plot summary, but then goes into behind the scenes stories and commentaries.  Through interviews with cast, crew, and creator J. Michael Straczynski, author Jane Killick is able to give a full picture of what went into each episode.  Some of my favorite parts are the stories of bloopers or jokes the cast played on each other.  I also find the summaries useful if I'm looking for a particular episode to rewatch.  Since the fourth season finale was actually the first episode of the fifth season production schedule, it's actually the first episode discussed here, creating a bonus, twenty-third chapter.<br />Starting out the book are two essays.  The first is a summary of just what the show accomplished over its five year run.  While fans and those reading these books will find little new, it's nice to have it all summarized in one place.  I especially like the page of quotes from cast members about what the show meant to them.  The second in an introduction to the fifth season, painting broad strokes of the story arcs introduced and developed over the course of the season.<br />Any fan will love to have this well researched book for a behind the scenes look at a wonderful piece of science fiction television history.	2004-04-13

The result is sure to move any Christian.<br />The book is made up of short vignettes.  They start with the triumphal entry and proceed through Resurrection Sunday, with events from every day but Saturday.  Whether teaching at the temple or at a rigged trial, these brief passages give some insight into Jewish customs or character's thoughts.  Obviously, some of this is extra-Biblical, so it fits the Bible story.<br />If parts of this book seem familiar, it was released several years ago as THE CARPENTER'S CLOTH.  Furthermore, parts were also incorporated into his novel THE WEEPING CHAMBER.  If you like this book, I definitely recommend you pick up that novel.  It is just as powerful and moving while giving a bigger picture then this does.<br />Sometimes with only a few paragraphs, Mr. Brouwer is able to give fresh insight into the familiar Bible story.  I've used this book as a devotional guide during Passion Week.  It touched my heart and made me appreciate anew what Jesus did for me.	2004-04-11

So he decides to sell the house and move west with his family.  Just before the ice breaks, the family loads up their wagon and heads out.  They cross the Mississippi River and then head south, settling two days away from Independence, Missouri.  Now they have to build a new house and survive the wilderness.  Meanwhile, Laura is anxious to see a papoose.  And with all the Indians in the area, she may get her chance.<br />This is a charming book.  It's almost a collection of short stories with many chapters being a self-contained event.  Still, through these pages, we get a good picture of life on the American frontier 130 years ago.  The book gives plenty of detail about their everyday life without getting bogged down.  And it is interesting.  Frankly, some of the chapters are so harrowing I felt my pulse quicken.  Often I found myself shaking my head in awe at what the Ingalls dealt with on a daily basis.  This is a good way to make anyone appreciate just what we have today.<br />These books are still popular 70 years after they were first written for good reason.  They are an entertaining and enlightening look at a bygone era.	2004-04-08

While members of the Tribulation Force try to find out what happened to them, the forces of Carpathia are taking over Jerusalem and lining up to attack Petra again.  Chaim is trying one last effort to save those who might still be undecided.  But the thought foremost on everyone's mind is, today is the day we will get to see Jesus.<br />So really, the question comes down to, will fans like it?  As with just about every book in the series, reaction will be mixed, but I liked it.  There were some amazing scenes and it once again renewed my faith in God's awesome power.  Yes, there were some things that made me roll my eyes, especially characters desires to get to a particular place to see what would happen.  I know why the authors did it (so we could see it), but it did seem to get out of hand a few times.  They even managed to explain logically some of my biggest complaints with the ending of the last book.<br />However, there are some flaws.  The second half of the book seems to really slow down with pages of scripture quotes.  While some of that is fine, it got to be excessive at times, and I found myself skimming past it.  And, while the final chapter was wonderful for us long time fans, that chapter was what I was looking forward to most and could have been longer.<br />In the end, I think fans will find it a satisfying end to the series.  New comers will be lost if they jump in here.  It really is best to start at the beginning.  And people who don't like the series will certainly want to steer clear as there will be nothing here to change their minds.	2004-04-07

One night, she stumbles on a man face down in a stream.  She manages to revive Peter Fox, and the two share drinks in the bar.  But when she is kidnapped the next day to make Peter do something, she realizes there is much more going on then meets the eye. Now she must team up with Peter, who is hiding a past of his own, to solve this mystery before both of them are as dead as the poets she loves to study.<br />I really enjoyed this book. The plot gets a little convoluted at times, so you really need to pay attention. There is one major plot point that doesn't seem to be resolved.  This really did bother me. The book is equal parts mystery and romance, and the romance aspect is more pronounced then I normally like, but I really enjoyed it. The two lead characters are interesting and entertaining.  I especially loved Peter's sarcasm and Grace's resourcefulness.<br />While not as completely wrapped up as it seems like it should have been, this is still a worthwhile book.  Pick it up and hang on for the wild ride ahead.  I can't wait for the next in this fun series.	2004-04-01

Now the Bob Whites must figure out some way to get the money to fix it before winter comes and ruins everything inside.  When Brian donates the money he had been saving to buy Mr. Lytell's car, Trixie and Honey work overtime to come up with some way to repay him.  They hit upon the idea of patrolling the Wheeler's game preserve.  But when Trixie begins to suspect that a poacher is on the loose, the girls may have more then they can handle.<br />First, let me say that I absolutely love this series.  I've been reading it for over 15 years.  But I have never liked this book.  The plot just moves too slowly for this action oriented guy.  Plus, I've never found the story believable, even when I read it as a kid.<br />Many fans love this book because of the great character interactions.  I will certainly grant that there are some wonderful character moments, and if that's what I'm in the mode for, I certainly check this book out.  It's not my first choice when it comes time to reread a Trixie, however.<br />If you like Trixie, you'll want to read this book and form your own opinion.  However, if you are new to this wonderful girl detective, start with the first four.  They are much better books to get you as addicted as I am to Trixie and her friends.	2004-03-26

The group she plays with on the first day consists of four employees from Meditron Pharmaceuticals.  The tension is very obvious to outsider Cassie, and is never far from the surface, even when they go out for dinner later.  But when the only woman in the group turns up dead, Cassie is surprised.  The police are quick to rule it a suicide.  That is where all the evidence points, but Cassie doesn't believe it for a second.  What really happened to this woman?  And will investigating this murder hamper Cassie's playing in the tournament?  Meanwhile, her love life, or lack there of, is also hitting some major road blocks.<br />This series intrigues me because of the inside look at the LPGA.  The golf scenes are written well, and I keep coming back to find out just how well rookie Cassie will play.  Unfortunately, the mystery is not as well developed.  Frankly, I didn't believe Cassie's reasons for investigating this death.  Amateur sleuths need a compelling reason to be involved, and this book lacks that.  Second, the ending felt rushed and not as developed as most of the books I like.  However, I've really grown to care about Cassie and her friends Joe and Laura.<br />The golf and the characters are interesting enough to bring me back for a third round.  Hopefully, the mystery itself will be better polished next time around.	2004-03-25

After the qualifying race, they witness the random mugging of a woman they had just met.  When Zeke follows the thief, he's convinced there's more to it then a normal crime.  Is the victim still in danger?  What about Zeke and the Gaos?  And will this mystery interfere with the big race the next day?<br />This book is perfect for the sports buff or mystery fan.  Between the race and the mystery, there are plenty of action sequences.  I got sucked in and read more then I had intended one night.  I had a few plot points figured out before Zeke, but I was caught off guard by many of the twists.  And it had me ready to cheer at the end.  Zeke is a fun character, and watching him get himself out of some pretty hairy situations is certainly entertaining.<br />Kids looking for some action in what they read will love both of the books in this fun series.  I may be over the target age group, but I'm already looking forward to Zeke's next adventure.  These books are certain to entertain anyone looking for a good story.	2004-03-25

Not only is she juggling the demands of running The Cookie Jar, but her brother-in-law is running for sheriff in a very tight race and she's trying to organize the recipes for the Lake Eden cookbook.  One night, as she's taking the trash out after her potluck cooking class (a convenient way to test all the recipes to make sure they're right before the book goes to print), she finds the body of Sheriff Grant in the dumpster.  Now Bill is suspended from work because he's a suspect, and Hannah must clear him by finding the killer before he drives the very pregnant Andrea crazy cleaning out their house.  This also adds major complications to Hannah's relationship with Bill's partner Mike.  Meanwhile, her mother is acting strangely, and she needs to get her cat to eat his senior cat food.  And she's searching for the missing ingredient in Mrs. Koester's fudge cupcake recipe so it can make the book.  Can Hannah juggle all these competing demands?<br />Needless to say, there's never a dull moment in this book.  There are a few times when the murder investigation seems to stall briefly, but the other sub-plots take up the slack.  Frankly, I hardly noticed because there is so much else happening.  The mystery does progress well, with an ending I figured out a little before Hannah, but not by much.  All the characters we've come to love are back, and it's definitely a wonderful visit with old friends.  This book contains 10 delicious sounding recipes.  (A word about the title recipe.  The first edition contains an error.  It should read 1 1/2 teaspoons baking POWDER not baking soda.

It is consistently funny.  The authors, Jerry Scott and Jim Borgman, use every humor tool available to them to get their point across.  And, no matter whether it's exaggeration, sarcasm, understatement, or a hilarious sight gag, this book is sure to entertain.<br />The collection starts with the &quot;director's cut&quot; of &quot;Good Night Dude.&quot;  The original strip appears later in the collection, but here we get a full spoof of the classic picture book.<br />From there, we launch into the daily strip.  This book contains strips from sketchbooks #5 and 6, &quot;Unzipped&quot; and &quot;Busted.&quot;  As an added bonus, the Sunday comics are in color.  We get about a year and a half of strips all in one place.  Not only do we get the latest on Jeremy and Sara's rocky relationship, but we get to see Jeremy and Hector start their own summer business for no fun and little profit.  Pierce also joins the band this time around, with the most amazing intro to the most amazing drum solo you've ever heard.  Along the way, gentle fun is poked at teens, parents, peers, and school equally.<br />Actually, the peers seem to have come into their own this go around.  I don't remember enjoying Jeremy's friends from school so much.  And Hector's put downs remind me of Hobbes from &quot;Calvin and Hobbes.&quot;  I especially loved his stuff from the week about the internet intelligence quiz.<br />Any teen or anyone living with a teen will love this strip.  If you aren't careful, you might even starting laughing at yourself a little more.	2004-03-10

But part way through the party, she gets a call that her husband, conservative political activist Louis Gibson, has been murdered in his current mistress's apartment.  Stephanie insists that Aaron investigate, even getting him a lucrative article deal with a high profile magazine if he does so.  But Aaron hardly knows where to start.<br />Meanwhile, the principal of his kids' school has come to him for help.  Someone has set off three stink bombs, and the parents are putting pressure on her to find the culprit.  Only problem is, she has no clue where to start.  As if that weren't enough, the Tuckers are also experiencing the joys of pet ownership.  There's certainly never a dull moment in Aaron's life.  But can he juggle it all and solve the mysteries?<br />There's certainly never a dull moment in the book either.  Narrated first person with plenty of sarcasm and puns, I grinned, chuckled, and laughed my way through the entire book.  You can't help but fall in love with the Tuckers.  They are a wonderful, warm family who face life with a twinkle in their eye.  The relationship between Aaron and his wife Abby is especially enjoyable.  The plot starts a little slow, but gains speed the further you go in the book and has a few nice surprises before you reach the end.  Being a conservative, I was a little put out by the &quot;Liberal good, conservative bad&quot; characterizations that popped up every so often, but I was able to shrug that off.<br />My real problem with the book was the timeline.  Entire days seemed to drop off the face of the earth with no explanation.  Characters agree to meet one day, then meet another and act like it's what the plans were all along.  I kept flipping back in the book to make sure I hadn't missed something.  It doesn't affect the plot, but it sure is annoying.  A final edit for these things and a few paragraphs scattered throughout to fill in missing time would have fix the problem.<br />With that issue in mind, this is still an enjoyable book anyone will love.  I will certainly be spending more time with Aaron and his family and friends.se things and a few paragraphs scattered throughout to fill in missing time would have fix the problem.<br />With that issue in mind, this is still an enjoyable book anyone will love.

He's not too surprised when she leaves everything to him, since they are the only relatives they have left.  The will includes the stipulation that he must keep the store open for at least five years and not sell it or River's Edge, the building the shop is in which he now also owns.<br />Since Harrison was at a dead end in his life, he moves the few miles to his new business.  He's greeted his first morning there by a break-in at his great aunt's apartment on the premises.  Since the place had obviously been searched, he begins to suspect that Belle's death may have been more then an accident and is determined to find out what really happened to her.  Thinking it might be one of his new tenants, he becomes paranoid that their offers for help are really offers to search again.  Add to that a new business he knows nothing about and an employee at the store who he seems to upset regularly and he has his work cut out for him.<br />I really did enjoy this new series debut.  Harrison and his new friends are interesting and believable characters.  I especially appreciated Harrison's habit of putting his foot in his mouth on a regular basis, something I tend to do myself.  This book puts us in an interesting position.  The prologue actually starts with Belle's death, so we know the what and the why, but not the who.  As a result, we spend parts of the book waiting for Harrison to figure out what we know and I figured out one major plot point long before Harrison did.  Still, the characters were interesting enough to keep me entertained, and the ending was completely believable, both who the killer was and how Harrison figured it out.<br />The characters in this new series debut already feel like friends already.  I can't wait to see them again.  I haven't read this author in a couple years, but I'm going to have to go back and read his other series as well.	2004-03-01

Well, Steve is, but Mark is missing his work and solving mysteries.  While Steve sight-sees, Mark spends his time helping fellow guests with their minor injuries.  In this way, he befriends Danny Royal, a local who just swam through a school of jelly fish.  Mark is shocked to see Danny attacked by a shark the next day.  But when the body is recovered, Mark suspects that it was really murder.  Steve is reluctantly drawn into the investigation.  Mark and Steve are surprised to learn that Danny was not who they thought he was.  In fact, they don't know who he was.  Can they solve this bizarre crime in time to stop the killer from striking again?<br />Once again, Lee Goldberg has captured the heart and sole of this TV show.  Just what you'd expect from one of the former producers.  The plot of this book is original.  We know most of what's going on and why before Mark does, even spending time in the villain's point of view.  But this only makes the suspense mount as we watched Mark try to figure things out before the killer strikes again.  My only real complaint is that Jesse and Amanda have greatly reduced roles.  I always loved the ensemble feel of the show.  Still, their appearances are great, and I especially loved their first scene at BBQ Bob's.<br />Any fan of this TV show should do themselves a favor and get this book.  Even if you didn't watch the show, you'll still enjoy this thrilling tale of detection starring a wonderful amateur sleuth.	2004-02-27

He can't imagine anything worse then that.  Still, he decides to make the best of it and comes up with a few ways to hopefully keep track of Joel.<br />When they arrive at camp, Ricky and his friends find that Joel is the least of their problems.  They disregard the warnings about ghosts, but how can they explain the way things keep disappearing?  First it's the hatchets and axes.  Then Ricky finds his shirt bloodied and stuck to a stump with an arrow sticking out of it.  And that's just for starters.  What's going on?  Will they stay and finish out their week?  Or will they head back to Jamesville early?<br />This is an outstanding entry in the kid's mystery series.  The plot starts out a little slowly, but in the second half it builds quickly and includes one of the best \\"ghosts\\" scenes I have ever read.  It truly creeps me out still as an adult, and I know what's going on.  This is possibly one of the funniest books in the series as well with Joel constantly outsmarting everyone, even the adults on the trip.  And poor Bruce and Jim provide several great laughs as well as they try to get back at Ricky for some pranks they think he's pulled on them.  Along the way, a couple important lessons are imparted in a way that feels to be as much a part of the book as the plot and characters.<br />This is a fun book in a fun series that will have you laughing out loud one minute and quickly turning the pages the next.  Recommended for any kid or kid at heart who enjoys a good tale told well.	2004-02-25

Her job is interesting, tracking down literary forgers and keeping competing cults of literary fanatics from going to far to prove their points.  The most excitement her life sees is the occasional visit of her father who pops in for a few minutes at a time as he stays on the run through time.<br />Her life changes when a priceless Dickens original manuscript is changed.  Suddenly, she finds herself on the trail of Acheron Hades, the third most wanted criminal in the world.  With his special powers, he's almost impossible to capture.  Transferring to Swindon, she finds her paths crossing with a former flame.  Will love rekindle?  Meanwhile, Hades is holding the characters of Dickens' novel hostage and threatening to kill them.  Can Thursday figure out a way to stop him before he ruins some classic works of literature?<br />This is a wonderful Fantasy Adventure novel.  The alternate world of 1985 presented here is a great place to escape.  The idea of crossing between reality and works of fiction is something I've never seen done before but often dreamed of doing and is handled here quite well.  The novel started quite slowly, with what I was expecting to have happen not really getting going until the second half.  It also helps to be more familiar with literature then I am to fully appreciate this book.  Still, this is an imaginative tale well told.<br />Here is a book that readers will truly appreciate and a fantasy novel that literary fans will have to read.  I'll certainly be back to check out the further adventures of Thursday Next.	2004-02-22

That's what she tells herself as she shows up at the airport for a trip to Norway in spite of all the warnings.  Still, she is unprepared for the check in desk to be blown through the roof just after she misses her flight.<br />Meanwhile, Dirk Gently has hit a low.  He has almost no money and no clients.  Except the one he's forgotten about who promptly gets himself killed.  Now Dirk feels responsible for not taking this guy's claims serious and wants to track down the green eyed monster.  As if that weren't enough, he and his cleaning lady are having a war over who will open his fridge first, an out of order soda machine keeps appearing and disappearing, and he's being stalked by an eagle.  What these seemingly unrelated events have to do with each other provides plenty of wacky entertainment.<br />I am still only mildly familiar with the books of Douglas Adams, and I simply must correct that.  This fantasy novel was wonderfully strange and entertaining.  The opening bits about the airport and Kate's trip had me laughing out loud.  The laughs slowed down over the course of the book, but they were still plentiful.  Maybe it's my normal reading of mysteries, but my only real complaint was an ending that was really more confusing then enlightening of what had gone on before.<br />Actually, I listened to the audio version of this book, read by the author.  These can be hit or miss, depending on the author.  Douglas Adams did an exceptional job of reading, throwing just the right tones and inflections in for the best effect.  About the only complaint on this part was that the scene changes were so sudden and abrupt that it could confuse you for a few seconds even when you're paying attention.<br />Whether you get your hands on the audio version of stick with the traditional print version, this is a wonderful title sure to entertain.

I've been listening to Adventures in Odyssey since its very first broadcast.

And she certainly didn't want to marry Judah's eldest son, Er.  But being a woman, her opinion was never even asked.  She is disappointed to find that the stories about his cruelty are true.  Furthermore, her mother-in-law is horrid as well.  Still, Tamar does her best to fit in with her new family and do her one duty, produce a son.  But when tragedy strikes the family, she faces more hardship.  Will the God of Judah be with her?<br />This book had an almost insurmountable task ahead of it.  I've never particularly liked the story of Tamar in Genesis.  Still, I tried to read this with an open mind.  I found I enjoyed most of it, especially the connections it made that I had never made with the story of Joseph.  It made me view the story in a completely different light by viewing the context.  It also goes a long way in explaining the customs of the times which help put the story in perspective as well.  Still, I did feel the fictitious part of the ending was a tad unrealistic and rushed.<br />This well researched novella sheds a different light on one of the woman God honored by including by name in the genealogy of Jesus.  The included study guide helps us take lessons from this story into our everyday lives.  While not my favorite story to begin with, this book helped me see past that to the importance of it in the greatest story ever told.	2004-02-13

There are wild animals in the woods, and they must provide for themselves since the nearest town in hours away.  But it's not all hard work.  If Pa's not tired, he might entertain his daughters with a story or by playing his fiddle.  With family relatively nearby to visit, life is certainly never dull.<br />I had not read these books since I was a child until picking this up to reread.  I had forgotten how entertaining they really are.  There is no real plot, just a collection of stories covering a year in the life of the Ingalls family.  This makes sense since they really are an autobiographical work.  Still, the simple charm of the stories sucked me right in and I had a hard time putting the book down.  There is plenty of detail here to give anyone a good picture of daily life during this time.  And I must mention the illustrations by Garth Williams that greatly add to the book.<br />There's a reason these books are so well loved 70 years after they were written.  They are an entertaining look at everyday life in a different time and place.  This is a book to treasure.	2004-02-11

There is a huge hole in the glass ceiling, the groom is dead, and the valuable ring is missing.  When a guard is attacked during another robbery at the historic society a few days later, Theo is convinced that there is a cat burglar loose in the area.  Is she right?  Will the police listen to her if she is?  Or will one of her friends take the blame for the robberies?<br />This series is strongest in atmosphere.  The historic district of Charlestown comes to life and the cozy setting of the tea shop and characters of Theo and her friends make for a fun read.  This book has one of the better mysteries of the series, with red herrings all over the place.  I was confused and constantly kept shifting who I thought had done it.<br />This series will appeal best to the die hard cozy crowd.  I enjoy them when I'm looking for something light and entertaining.	2004-02-09

She hardly ever looses a case and is able to find the holes in any argument.  Her personal life isn't so rosy, however.  She is basically estranged from her daughter and considered a problem by her co-workers.  Her life really begins to unravel when her daughter announces her engagement - to a man Venetia has recently gotten off for murder.  But when Venetia is found dead in her office two days later, it's up to Adam Dalgliesh and his team to figure out who killed her.  And with all these motives and suspects, it won't be easy.<br />I'd heard much about P.D. James, but this was the first time I'd actually read one of her books.  I found the writing style engaging and would have a hard time putting it down once I started.  On the other hand, I'd have a hard time picking it up again.  The beginning especially seems to give us too much background on our characters, stuff we don't need to learn until later if at all.  This really slowed the story down for me.<br />The more I got into it, the better I enjoyed it, however.  There were some nice twists along the way with an intriguing sub-plot.  The last couple of chapters did seem a little anti-climatic considering what had gone before, but I was surprised by who the killer turned out to be.  Using multiple view points greatly added to the story most of the time, although it did confuse me some as far as timeline goes.<br />I can understand why P.D. James has such a fine reputation.  She can paint a picture with words like few other writers currently writing.  While she may be a tad too slow for my normal taste, I'm certainly glad to see what all the talk is about.  Her reputation is well earned.	2004-02-04

The main plot for the entire series was mapped out before the show even started.  As a result, it developed a loyal fan base that still loves it.<br />This book is the fourth in a series of five episode guides to the series.  Covering the fourth season, it has a separate chapter for each of the twenty-two episodes.  Each starts with a plot summary, but then goes into behind the scenes stories and commentaries.  Through interviews with cast, crew, and creator J. Michael Straczynski, author Jane Killick is able to give a full picture of what went into each episode.  Some of my favorite parts are the stories of bloopers or jokes the cast played on each other.  I also find the summaries useful if I'm looking for a particular episode to rewatch.  Because the season finale was filmed as late (as part of the fifth season production schedule), it only has a summary here.  The behind the scenes stuff was included in the book for season 5, however.<br />Starting out the book are two essays.  The first provides a detailed account of the making of any episode.  Every part is discussed from scriptwriting to pre-production, scheduling, post filming special effects, and the music of the show.  The second in an introduction to the fourth season, painting broad strokes of the story arcs introduced and developed over the course of the season.<br />Any fan will love to have this well researched book for a behind the scenes look at a wonderful piece of science fiction television history.	2004-01-21

They're a little concerned since Madeline had left for home a little earlier then normal dog tired, but they think she'll be fine tomorrow.  Then they hear the news bulletin.  Someone has been murdered in Madeline's bed.<br />Twelve hours earlier, Madeline and her employees and co-workers are getting ready for the Jazz Ball, a huge event to raise money for the Woodburn School for Music.  Madeline runs out to get something from her car, only to find trash all over the place.  On closer examination, she finds it's personal papers belonging to a neighbor.  She's shock when her offer to return the papers is met with hostility and the offer of a blackmail payment.<br />If that weren't enough, the prize item from the charity auction at the ball, a rare saxophone, vanishes without a trace.  What could have happened to it?  Throw in the return of Chuck Honnett and a new love interest, and Madeline's life may be more complicated then she knows what to do with.  Especially if she doesn't know whom to trust.<br />It's no secret that this series has been a favorite since I first found it a couple years ago.  This entry finds Madeline, and her author, in top form.  The plot weaves all over the place before we reach a heart pounding climax.  The characters spring off the page, especially Madeline, Wes, and Holly.  And the two sidekicks get plenty of &quot;page&quot; time this go around.  They really do make a great trio.  Jerrilyn Farmer has such a fun, breezy writing style that it's easy to be sucked into the book and hard to put it down.<br />This is a series to savor.  Best read in order; start with SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL.  I already can't wait for Madeline's next wild and fun adventure.	2004-01-19

She'll spend time with fellow trainees sharpening skills and getting a crash course in French.  Along the way, her new handler at SD-6, Sloan, asks her to complete a simple retrieval mission.  It should be a fun time, especially since she won't have to lie to anyone there.  They are all agents, so she won't have to pretend she's only a student.<br />Her roommate, Stephanie, seems like a perfect fit, and the two hit it off right away.  But when an accident happens, Sydney begins to suspect things are not what they appear.  Now this mini-vacation may turn out to be her last.<br />This is another fun prequel novel for Alias.  While not as intense as the last one was, it was still entertaining and held my interest quite well.  I especially loved the Niagara Falls setting since I had been there and could picture most of what was going on.  These novels are developing quite a story on their own, and this one does a good job of giving you the back story quickly and then moving into the new material.  This book is also notable because it marks the first appearance of Emily Sloan.<br />While non-fans will probably not be impressed, fans of the series will continue to enjoy these stories before the real story began.	2004-01-15

In this book, he takes his work to the next level.<br />The premise of this book is clear.  In an age of relativism, we are loosing the youth of today because they don't believe in truth any more.  Many believe that Christianity is just one acceptable way out of many and Jesus was a good teacher.  Yet, today's youth are also adrift, not sure how to deal with what life brings their way.<br />The solution is to show youth that Christianity is true.  If Christianity is true, it provides the answers to all of life.  But it is not one way out of many or a blind faith.  There is evidence that backs up what the Bible says.  McDowell takes on the Deity of Christ, Scripture, and the Resurrection.  In successive parts, he gives an overview of the evidence and then moves on to what that means in the lives of believers.<br />The call of this book is important.  We must continue to be ready to give an answer to every man who asks as Peter tells us to do.  And the logical extension of what that means to us is an important touch.  Sometimes that is overlooked in the rush to present apologetics.  This book challenged and encouraged me as I was reading it.<br />Unfortunately, it doesn't have quite the punch it could.  McDowell tries to illustrate the importance of what he is talking about with stories from a fictitious youth group.  While some of it works, other parts are weak and actually detract from the overall message.  A little less time with the fiction and a little more time making his points other ways would have made this a stronger book.<br />This is an important step forward for modern apologetics, being ready to share with today's youth.

Bogart show until Rudy from West Sacramento calls in.  He claims to have seen someone carrying out the body of fellow talk show host Dr. Hipster.  Since he is Shauna's best friend and mentor, Shauna doesn't find the call at all funny.  Just in case, she sends Glory Lou, the station news force, to check it out.  She's devastated to learn that it is indeed true.  Even more disturbing is the fact that the police are calling it a suicide, and the suicide note makes it seem that Shauna is to blame.  Knowing that can't be the case, she starts to investigate, starting with the show that Dr. Hipster had planned for that night.  It seems to be a standard show with information about the current governor's race in California.  What had Dr. Hipster learned that lead to his death?  With constant clues coming in that don't make any sense, Shauna may be facing more then she bargained for.<br />When I learned that this book was a St. Martin's Press winner, I had to give it a try.  And I wasn't disappointed.  The clues come fast and furious, but just lead me around in circles.  I was so hooked I stayed up way too late two nights in a row to get &quot;just a little further.&quot;  Shauna and her friends are fun characters.  I enjoyed getting to know them and hope the entire gang is around for the sequel.  And the setting, a local talk radio station, is interesting.  The author's many years in the business are evident as facts are put in smoothly to bring the story more vividly to life.  I will add that the first couple of chapters seem a little rough, but once I got past those, everything smoothed out and I never looked back.<br />I do have two serious complaints about this book.  First, I didn't read it sooner.  Second, I don't see how the author will ever top this fun, intriguing first effort.  I won't be too surprised if this wins the Agatha award this year and will be shocked if it's not at least nominated for best first novel.  It certainly deserves it.nly deserves it.	2004-01-08

Her first job is at an exclusive clothing store that caters to the highly fashionable of South Florida.  Just when she decides her boss is doing some illegal stuff, she vanishes, only to turn up dead.  Can Helen find the killer before her past comes out?<br />The book is advertised as a humorous mystery, but I only laughed on the last page.  Not because it was over, but because I finally found something truly funny.  I think part of the problem is that the narration often seemed more detached then it should have been.  The story was interesting and I liked the character even if I thought Helen's reason for being on the run was rather stupid.<br />I'll most likely give the series another chance, but this book didn't live up to my expectations.	2004-01-07

The first half goes well, but after the intermission, Daisy's neighbor, raising mezzo Bettina Westlea, takes a sip from her bottle on stage and drops dead.  Alec is upset that Daisy has once again gotten involved in one of his cases, but he must accept her help when suspects start telling her things they refuse to tell the police.  Each of them has a different chief suspect in mind, but Bettina has made enough enemies that there are plenty of lesser suspects.  Will they find the killer?<br />This book brings 1923 London to vivid life and fills it with interesting characters.  The plot does seem to get bogged down a few times with a little too much recap, but it includes a couple of nice twists and kept me guessing.  My biggest complain was the ending.  It felt rushed, and therefore I felt cheated.<br />If you enjoy mysteries with a historic setting and interesting characters, this series is certainly for you.	2004-01-07

The mall parking lots are being stalked by the Santa Rapist.  PI Savannah Reid has been asked by her friend, detective Dirk Coulter, to help nab this jerk before he ruins the town's Christmas celebration.  There are very few leads to go on until one smart kid manages to get away.  Now Savannah is asked to keep the girl safe, getting her mixed up in a family she'd rather avoid.  The stakes are raised when a shooting occurs.  But is it connected with the case?<br />Normally, I read series in order, but a friend had sent me this book and I thought it'd be fun to read a mystery set around Christmas time this month.  This book wasn't quite what I was expecting.  From the title of this and others in the series, I was expecting a light, cozy type book.  Obviously, I hadn't read the back cover.  This book is much darker then what I normally read.  In fact, I almost quite when I realized what I'd gotten myself into.  I hate to quit on books, however, and I'm glad I persevered.<br />The story works on several different levels, with sub-plots to keep you entertained.  Even so, the mystery developed nicely, with plenty of red herrings that kept me guessing until the end.  Savannah and her friends and family are interesting characters, and I enjoyed spending time with them, even if the reason why wasn't pleasant.<br />I don't know if this book was abnormally dark for the series of if this is normal.  All I do know is that I enjoyed it and think I'll be spending more time in San Carmelita.  I just won't do it until I'm ready for a book that's a bit darker then normal.	2003-12-16

This time, Dr. Leopold Atkins needs them to find out what's happening on the distant planet of Janus.  He's recently gotten an order for a robot to be the royal robot buddy to the young prince.  The suspicious part is that the robot is supposed to be programmed to obey the Duke without question.<br />With the application of freckles, Danny and Jack look just like the prince.  But a last minute problem makes Jack take the place of the robot.  Can he maintain his cover?  Where is the real prince?  Is there any way Danny can help Jack out of this problem?<br />When I discovered there was a fourth book about this pair, I was thrilled.  Unfortunately, this book didn't live up to the last couple in the series, even when I was a kid.  First, Danny hardly has more then a walk on part, a definite downgrade from the other books.  Second, the coincidence of Jack and Danny looking so much like the prince was too much to swallow.  Finally, the two communicating solely through ESP was too convenient for my taste.<br />Overall, I do like this book, however.  The alien planet is truly foreign and really captures the imagination.  The plot takes a few unexpected twists I really enjoyed, and it's hard to figure out how Jack will make it out alive.  Finally, watching Jack slowly get some skill in poetry, his school assignment before they leave, is a nice touch and fun to watch.<br />While not up to the last couple of books in the series, this story still has plenty to offer a fan of Jack and Danny.  Even with its flaws, I enjoy it.	2003-12-13

When Hershel Perkins picks a fight with Joe Woodyard in the local post office, Lee McKinney and the other locals think little of it.  Hershel is known as the town crank, nice enough, but he's fought with just about everyone.  But that night, Hershel goes missing.  All the evidence points to Joe, but Lee refuses to believe her boyfriend could have had anything to do with it.  When Hershel is found dead, the stack of evidence could be overwhelming.  Lee overhears some things that make her wonder about Joe.  They don't know each other too well yet.  Still, it's such an obvious frame job even the sheriff is looking for other suspects.  An attempt on Lee and Joe's life only confirms the fact that something else sinister is going on in this small resort town.  Can they stay alive long enough to clear Joe's name from town gossip and the law?<br />Anyone looking for a light, fun cozy need look no further then this charming series.  Being the third in the series, we are given just enough background to remind us of the characters, but not enough to slow down the story.  The plot moves along nicely, with several scenes that had me turning pages as quickly as I could.  While it reaches a logical conclusions, there was one plot point that needed a little ironing out.  It wasn't enough to detract from the book overall for me, however.  The author brings the small town Michigan setting and the characters to life with ease, and she introduces a potential new series character I can't wait to see again.  The descriptions of the chocolates are enough to make your mouth water, so be prepared.  The \\"chocolate chats\\" in this book focus on the history of chocolate and were more interesting then some of the ones in previous books have been.<br />Once again, I enjoyed each page of the book and am already looking forward to my next visit to Warner Pier, Michigan.	2003-12-11

Joseph Burke and Kate Donovan were finally getting married.  But the rejoicing turned to sorrow when the groom was arrested at the reception for his part in the recent Irish repeal movement.  Unknown to Joseph and Kate, this is part of a larger scheme by neighbor Colonel Mahon in an attempt to take over their lands.  As he plots and schemes, Kate finds herself in danger.  Joseph becomes a further victim of the plot.  Will last minute attempts to stop his punishment be successful?  Will he and Kate ever be reunited?  Can she survive Mahon's plans for her?<br />The first part of this book was so hard for me to get through, I thought about quitting.  I just wasn't sure that I could deal with any more of the character's sadness.  But just before I quit, the pace of the story really picked up and I got drawn into these character's lives once again.  There are so many fascinating plots levied against them, I had a hard time putting the book down until I reached the satisfying ending.  As always, the Thoene's back up their story with wonderful historical research that makes this time period come vividly to life.<br />With the way this book ended, you can bet it won't be too long before I'm back for the final chapter in these characters's saga.  And I'm sure I'll enjoy it just as much as I did this chapter.  Well worth reading.	2003-12-09

(Classic Seuss)	Books	5	9	10	N	Y	Scrooge for Kids	Maybe that's oversimplifying a bit, but the basics are the same.  In this story, we have the Grinch, who hates Christmas and every year must put up with the celebration of the Whos who live in the valley below his cave.  But this year things will be different.  This year, he intends to do something about it.  Surely the Whos will be disappointed when they wake up Christmas morning to discover that all their presents and decorations have been stolen.  Or will they?<br /><br />Told is classic Seuss fashion, completely in rhymes, this book appeals to kids year round.  I know I insisted that it be read to me more then just in December.  The fanciful illustrations, also classic Seuss, are just as engaging as this story.  After all, what could be worse to kids then no Christmas?  Yet there is a message here that there is more to Christmas then the commercialism we see around us.  It's subtle and not expanded on greatly, but it's there none-the-less.<br /><br />Surely Charles Dickens' classic tale was an influence when Dr. Seuss sat down to write this book.  Both the main characters hate Christmas and miss the point, but have a revelation that shows them how important Christmas really is.  Of course, the meat of the stories is completely different, so kids not ready for Dickens will love this one.<br /><br />If there is such a thing as a classic picture book, this belongs in that category.  Enjoyable at Christmas, or the whole year round.	2003-12-09

It didn't come back until later, but an interesting look at the beginnings of an idea.  And some funny stuff along the way.  \\"The highs will be in the lows of the uppers.\\"<br />The gang always learns valuable lessons from \\"Camp What-a-Nut,\\" and the first visit is no exception.  And the cliffhanger between the parts is a real doozie.<br />The two part \\"Case of the Secret Room\\" finds Whit and Tom Riley's niece trying to solve the mystery of the skeleton in the basement of Whit's End.<br />Whit tells Jack and Lucy the story of Jonah and the whale (\\"Big fish.

The Hardys have few clues, but they follow them doggedly on a trail that leads them to South America and brings them plenty of danger.<br />I remembered enjoying this book as a kid, and rereading it, I found I enjoyed it again.  There is so much happening here, it's almost hard to keep it all straight.  And it's certainly hard to figure out how all the pieces will fit together.  Yet everything is skillfully woven together in the end for a breathtaking and logical climax.<br />The Hardys are always good for some exciting escapist fun, and this book is no exception.	2003-12-05

Not that normal ever describes anything they do.  Connie and Mitch are trying to make up for lost time in their relationship, but what's the cost to others?  And Mitch is offered a job that he quite possibly can't refuse.  We meet the Washingtons, who are being set up to become the next major family in Odyssey (and I can't wait).  We get to experience some of the early days of the Revolutionary War from a slightly different perspective thanks to a newly designed Imagination Station.  And Tom's wife is getting all riled up about something, but she can't remember what it is.  Meanwhile, Aubrey's friend Seth has moved to Odyssey and we discover that being different can have advantages.<br />While I enjoyed the Novacom storyline, it was nice to get back to a calmer Odyssey.  And, frankly, some of the themes of the episodes were a challenge to me.  The stories are fun and kids will love listening to them over and over again.<br />With over 500 episodes under their belt, it's nice to see that there seems to be plenty of life left in the show.  If they keep coming up with great stuff like this, I'll be enjoying the show for many more years to come.	2003-12-03

It was via a wardrobe in a spare room with Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.  I was immediately hooked, bought the set, read all the books, and got some of my friends to read them as well.  A few years later, I reread them, enjoying them just as much the second time.  This year, I set out to reread the series for the first time in 15 years.  Guess what.  I enjoyed them just as much this year as I have previously.<br />The basic premise of the series is that kids from our world are called into a magical world.  Trees are alive, and mythical creatures are common place.  Even the animals can talk.  The kids are called in a time of crisis to help the inhabitants of Narnia overcome the forces of evil.  Each book stands alone, although some of the kids appear in subsequent books.<br />Actually, there is a debate on what order the series should be read in.  Personally, I prefer the order they were written in because that's the order I read them in.  Arguments can be made for reading them in chorological order (THE HORSE AND HIS BOY and THE MAGICIAN'S NEWPHEW were written fifth and sixth even though they take place third and first).  Ultimate, very little from one book carries over to the next, so it doesn't matter.  You really could read them in random order and enjoy them just as much.<br />Since C.S. Lewis was a Christian, these books read on different levels.  There is the simple fantasy adventure, which is pure fun.  And that can be all you get out of the stories.  But just below the surface is a deeper meaning.  They worked equally well as allegories, and I usually miss symbolism, so this is fairly easy to get.  The stories are not strict allegories, but there is at least one truth from each book that you can take with you into our world.<br />These are some classics of kid's literature to be treasured by each generation.  But don't let the fact that they were meant for kids stop you.  Anyone can enjoy these timeless tales of fantasy.imeless tales of fantasy.	2003-11-25

But she finds divorce cases to be completely distasteful.  Just as she's resolved to put them behind her, she gets an assignment to go undercover in the sweatshops to find out who is stealing designs from one man and selling them to his competitor.  Then she is asked to find a young woman who ran away to America with her boyfriend.  Molly is thrilled since finding missing relatives is exactly what she wanted to do all along.  Now she just has to figure out how to balance the two since working in the sweatshops means working all day and the streets of 1901 New York City certainly aren't safe for a woman alone at night.<br />As if her life already weren't complicated enough, she still feels a responsibility to the O'Connors for her opportunity to come to America in the first place.  They are once again living with their cousins, and Shamey is joining a gang.  She feels she needs to figure out a way to get them into a better environment.  Her already complicated love life gets another wrinkle.  And she can't help but sympathize with the girls she's working with in the garment factories.  Even though she needs to keep quiet, she feels she must do something to help make their lives better.  With a little bit of Irish luck, she just might be able to pull it all off and come out alive on the other end.<br />Obviously, this is not your traditional mystery novel.  As much time is spent on life in 1901 as on the cases themselves.  But, as a result, Molly's world comes vividly to life.  And there is so much going on you can't put the book down.  Heck, I read it in little over a day myself.  The pace never slackens, and there are quite a few tense scenes.  Molly has really grown on me as a character, and I loved seeing her friends and adopted family again.  This book does talk about the ending of the last book, so it's best to read the series in order.<br />If you're looking for a murder and five suspects, look elsewhere.  If you want a historical mystery that will transport you to another time and place while entertaining you, this is the book for you.ook elsewhere.

She's the widow of a pirate, lives in an upside down house, and is always ready for a tea party with freshly baked cookies.  She's such an expert on kids that parents have started calling on her wisdom to cure their kids when they start misbehaving.  And whether it's making chores into a game or getting kids to take a bath, she's sure to have the answer to make everyone happy again.<br />I loved these books as a kid, and this book is just as fun now.  The stories fall into a predictable pattern, but that hardly diminishes their enjoyment.  Each chapter is a self-contained story, so it's easy to read just a little bit at a time.  Unlike other books in the series that feature magic cures, these stories feature what I recognize now as psychology to cure the kids.  The humor comes from the exaggeration of the problem and what the child goes through to get \\"cured.\\"  For example, the parent's fighting in the \\"Fighter Quarrelers Cure\\" or the tiny dishes in the \\"Slow Eater Tiny Bite Taker Cure.\\"  Heck, by the time the \\"Never Want to go to Bedders\\" are cured, they are actually begging to go to bed at their normal bedtime.<br />Reading the book as an adult, I got a few good laughs out of the names of the parent's friends.  I also found it interesting that very few of the adults have an identity apart from their kids.  Then again, as a kid's novel, it presents a kid's eye view of the world.  I hope these books continue to entertain for years to come.	2003-11-22

The main plot for the entire series was mapped out before the show even started.  As a result, it developed a loyal fan base that still loves it.<br />This book is the third in a series of five episode guides to the series.  Covering the third season, it has a separate chapter for each of the twenty-two episodes.  Each starts with a plot summary, but then goes into behind the scenes stories and commentaries.  Through interviews with cast, crew, and creator J. Michael Straczynski, author Jane Killick is able to give a full picture of what went into each episode.  Some of my favorite parts are the stories of bloopers or jokes the cast played on each other.  I also find the summaries useful if I'm looking for a particular episode to rewatch.<br />Starting out the book are two essays.  The first provides insight into creating the special effects for the show.  While the majority of the time is spent on describing the computer graphics used (something unheard of when the series started), there is also some insight into the traditional effects and the make-up used to create the aliens.  The second in an introduction to the third season, painting broad strokes of the story arcs introduced and developed over the course of the season.<br />Any fan will love to have this well researched book for a behind the scenes look at a wonderful piece of science fiction television history.	2003-11-21

Not that it keeps him out of trouble for keeping the secret.  Zoe and Hammie are experiencing the pangs of sibling rivalry, and it's just the two of them for now.  Meanwhile, Zoe's in first grade and Hammie's in pre-school.  And before this book is over, all the babies will be born.<br />I'd forgotten just how much I enjoy this strip until I picked this book up recently.  Authors Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott manage to find humor and irony in everyday situations and conversations, making it easy to identify with.  Wanda especially has a great sense of sarcasm, which I always enjoy.  Yet the strip also captures loving family moments without being too sappy.<br />This is one of the truly funny strips still in papers today.  I won't let it be this long before I visit the MacPherson's again.	2003-11-20

But when he goes to investigate himself, he discovers that no one is allowed to see the Lion.  In fact, an ape is speaking for Him.  The new pronouncements are just as puzzling, including the enslavement of the talking animals.  What is going on?  His few allies include Eustace and Jill from our own world.  But can they defeat this new evil?<br />This book is different from others in the series because the story starts in Narnia and then brings the characters from our world into theirs.  But the differences don't stop there.  This is a stirring conclusion of a great series.  The symbolism is strong, and I find this book one of the most interesting of the series from that standpoint.  The story is probably one of the fastest in the series, with so much intrigue and fighting going on, it's hard to put down, even on a reread.  The ending leaves me with a feeling of euphoria mixed with just a little bit of melancholy because the series is over.<br />While the order the other books in the series are read doesn't matter as much, this one must be read at the end to fully appreciate it.  It's a wonderful ending to a wonderful series.  Don't miss it.	2003-11-20

Meanwhile, she's off on another mission, this time in LA.  She's the new intern at SpaceSoft, trying to determine if they are working on a new missile guidance system and who the client is.  And if that weren't enough, her father is in town between trips, and demanding Sydney's time.  Unbeknownst to her, he has a secret agenda all his own.  Just when things couldn't get any worse, she begins to suspect her handler and recruiter is hiding something big.  Is she right?  If so, what is it?<br />This prequel novel best captured the early days of the show.  There are several different plots and sub-plots working their way through the story, with never a dull moment.  Keeping the action in LA allows more things to be developed then we have been getting in these novels.  Yet everything is juggled well, with the story divided between family, work, and friends.  If only Sydney could juggle her real life as easily.<br />The book is also filled with irony on several different levels because we know what is really going on behind the scenes and how Sydney's life will change in just a few years.  I especially enjoyed getting a chance to watch Sydney and Jack interact before Sydney knows his secrets.  His actions make perfect sense to us, even if they don't to his daughter.  The ending packs quite a wallop, and I loved it.<br />For anyone who's been enjoying these prequels, this one is a must.  Fans of the TV series will enjoy it as well for a glimpse at Sydney before the show began.  While people not familiar with the show may enjoy it as well, they will miss much of what I enjoyed about the book.	2003-11-17

He's finally formed Mutant Wizards and released it as a computer game, to great success.  Now he's hard at work on the sequel in a new, larger office.<br />But something is going on just below the surface.  Rob is worried, so he asks Meg to investigate.  Since she's just hurt her hand and can't work as a blacksmith, she agrees.  After two weeks, she's done nothing but fill in for the receptionist and help them move into the new office space they share with a group of therapists.  But then Ted, the office practical joker, turns up dead on the mail cart.  He was a pain, but he was harmless, right?  When Rob is hauled off for the crime, Meg leaps into action to give the police other suspects, turning up quite a few secrets in the process.<br />This is the fourth adventure for Meg.  This one didn't feel quite as funny to me as the others, possibly because many of the supporting players from the first three weren't here for the main action.  There were still many amusing things along the way, however.  For example, the \\"affirmation bear\\" had me laughing every time it showed up.  The mystery plot is stronger here then others in the series, with quite a few unexpected revelations and a very nice twist at the end.  A couple personal sub-plots keep things interesting as well.  Everything comes together for a great climax that had me laughing and turning pages as fast as I could to find out what would happen next.<br />While those looking for the continued hijinks of Meg's eccentric family will be slightly disappointed with this book, there is still much to recommend it.  I enjoyed every page and found the book over all too fast.  Here's to many more entertaining adventures with Meg and her family and friends.	2003-11-12

Seems Otto Drago, a former employee at the Atkins Robot Company, is robot napping the residence of C.O.L.A.R.  Since Drago is evil, he can't be up to any good.  Since Jack and Danny look alike and Jack can pass for a robot, they're the perfect pair to attempt to foil Drago.  But it won't be easy, and the danger is sky high.  Will they be able to over come the odds and come out alive?<br />Growing up, this was my favorite of the books about Jack and Danny, and with good reason.  The plot is perfect.  The action cuts between the two main characters at the worst possible moments.  Plot points are timed just right, and the storyline holds together so well.  It helps that you just love these characters, and any time spent in their version of the future, even if it is a little outdated 20 years later, is still fun.<br />These books are worth tracking down and buying to enjoy time and time again.  If only a publishing company would reprint them.	2003-11-07

While pretending to have come home, he's really on assignment for Abraham Lincoln, finding out all he can about \\"The Monster,\\" the recently captured USS Merrimack.  He is horrified to learn that it is being made into an ironclad ship which will decimate the rest of the Union naval fleet.<br />The trip home also includes a chance meeting with Arabella Mills, Harry's first love.  Now married, her husband is in charge of the Merrimack.  But when she turns up dead in Harry's hotel room, it's Harry's former slave and friend Caesar Augustus who is accused of the crime and put on a fast track to execution.  Now Harry must get his information back to Lincoln in time to do some good while also finding the evidence to clear his friend, which is going to be hard in a city where he doesn't know who to trust.<br />This series is wonderful for Civil War buffs, historical fiction fans, and mystery lovers.  Richmond, circa 1862 came alive to me as I was reading, and I've learned more about the events of the Civil War from this series then I remembered from school.  Harry does seem to have an impressive list of acquaintances (Lincoln, Davis, and Lee for example), but meeting them allows us to get a complete view of the war and events in a way we couldn't otherwise.  Because Harry's returned to Virginia for this book, we also get a picture of the emotional battle waged by families on the other side of the issue.<br />The mystery in this book is strong.  I had no clue where what the big picture was until the end, although I did figure a couple plot points out before hand.  Seems everyone has something to hide, and it's not what I was thinking, that's for sure.<br />Because of the progressive nature of this series, it's best to start with the first book, MURDER AT MANASSAS, especially since this book discusses the outcome of that one.  If you are at all interested in this dark time in US history, I highly recommend this series.his series.	2003-11-05

Having recently lost her grandfather, she's come to the colonies to live with her uncle and aunt.  But her new town is completely different from her old life in Barbados.  Not only does she have to do the chores she used to have servants do, but her Puritan relatives are much stricter then her previous upbringing has taught her to be.<br />But her life isn't all bad.  There is the interest William, the most eligible bachelor in town, has shown in her.  And there's the refuge she's managed to find in Hannah, the town outcast suspected of being a witch.  But will she ever truly adjust to her new life?<br />I found this book in Jr. High, and have read it four or five times since then.  I recently reread it again, and was completely drawn into the story.  I couldn't put it down, and I already knew how it ended.  The characters are sympathetic and interesting, especially Kit.  You can help but root for her to find some happiness in her new life.  The plot is engrossing, with several sub-plots expertly woven through the book.  And the time and place of the setting is brought to life in such an amazing way it feels like you are actually in the town of Wethersfield.<br />This book is so engrossing that anyone will love it.  And the theme about judging others will stick with you long after you've read the last page.  I can not recommend this book highly enough.  Ms. Speare is an excellent author.	2003-10-30

But when his father, the Denver police commissioner, has his office broken into the day that Michael's personal effects are delivered, something doesn't feel right.  So Hannah Sampson is sent to investigate.<br />A homicide detective and the head of the Denver underwater recovery team, Hannah has the perfect credentials to find out if there's more to Michael's death then meets the eye.  At first skeptical, she quickly changes her mind when a car that's been following her tries to run her down her first morning on the islands.  But was it Michael's environmental policies?  Or had he found something else that got him murder?  Hannah's undeniable attraction to one of her top suspects only complicates matters.<br />This book is obviously a first novel.  It doesn't have quite the polish of someone with a few more books under her belt.  However, that only takes away slightly from the book.  The setting is an area that the author knows and loves, and it shows.  I'm ready to hop the next plane down to visit myself.  The underwater scenes bring a new world to life.  The plot, while a bit uneven, does progress nicely.  I had my suspicions, but I only figured things out a little before Hannah did, and the climax was breath taking.<br />This was an enjoyable debut, and I look forward to seeing the series progress when the next book is released.	2003-10-27

Uncle Andrew dapples in magic, and tricks Polly into taking one of his magic rings.  Digory goes after her, and they find themselves in a magic wood, a passageway to different worlds.  Exploring further, they find evil as well as a land about to be created.<br />This is a different story in the Narnia tales.  First, we don't arrive at Narnia until after half way through the book.  Second, this is the only book where actions in the fantasy worlds have direct impact on events in our world.  For these reasons, it's a fun change in the series.  The story in Narnia is simpler then the others, but it makes watching a new world take shape no less thrilling.  And there are some important lessons on doing the right thing at the right time and getting out of life exactly what you expect.<br />There is quite a debate about the order this book should be read in.  While it was published sixth, the events place it first.  When I read these books back in third grade, I read them in publication order, and I enjoyed that because there are some surprises in here that explain a couple scenes in the first book.  Admittedly biased, I think that reading them in publication order would make for the most enjoyment.  However, the issues involved are very minor and any of the books can really be read in any order without spoiling anything important.<br />No matter what order you choose to read the books in, make sure you do.  These are classic children's fantasy for a reason; they are fun stories that can be enjoyed by kids of all ages.	2003-10-21

But he's decided to make the best of it and is even thinking about fixing a cottage destroyed in a recent fire and moving in there in preparation for proposing to Bronwen.<br />Then the village is turned upside down when some filmmakers arrive.  They've come to make a documentary about the raising of a World War II German plane that crashed in a nearby lake.  Their past connection to Bronwen throws Evan for a loop.  But there is tension in this group, and when one of the filmmakers disappears, Evan suspects foul play.<br />Evan may be able to wait, but I certainly couldn't wait to get through this wonderful book.  The villagers of Llanfair are as charming and interesting as ever and I felt right at home.  This book seemed to have more connection to the character arcs from the last book, which I enjoyed.  The plot twists and turns in all sorts of ways.  I had a different suspect every chapter or two.  Naturally with a book like that, the logical solution completely escaped me until the end.<br />While I've enjoyed all of Ms. Bowen's books, this is my favorite to date.  You can bet I won't be waiting long before I read another.	2003-10-15

A week hunting for the mythological Ogopogo in British Columbia is the perfect thing to break up summer vacation.  But they've hardly left before things start going wrong.  First, Joel sneaks on board.  Then they find dynamite in the motor home they are traveling in.  Things only get worse when they arrive.  Ricky's going to have to think overtime to put all the pieces together in time to spare his friends' lives.<br />This has been my favorite in the series from the very first time I read it.  All the clues are right there in the open, but you never know what they are and what they mean until Ricky tells you.  And since he's often confused, that makes things even more interesting.  When first published, one aspect of the story was never fully explained, but that's been fixed for the republishing, and it's nice to finally have that answered.  The friends are at their teasing best, and there are several laugh-out-loud moments in the story.  There are even a couple interesting discussions on science and the Bible thrown in for good measure.<br />I recommend this series to anyone who likes a good mystery story.  It's equally fun for kids and adults.  This book stands above the rest for its wonderful plotting and strong story.	2003-10-09

The college freshman disappeared on her way to break up with her boyfriend.  But the boyfriend claims she never made it over.  Then her rental car is found with bloody fingerprints.  All Frank has to go on is a 20 year old newspaper article about a hit and run car accident.  Will that be enough to find her before it's too late?  If it isn't already.  Meanwhile, he's struggling with letting his red-tailed hawk Armistead return to the wild.<br />I'm not normally a reader of PI novels, but this series is making me rethink that.  The storyline is interesting, and the characters are well drawn.  I am aware they fall well within PI novel norms, but that doesn't really bother me in the least.  The added element of falconry adds another level of interest to an already strong book.<br />This series is certainly worth a look if you enjoy PI novels.  And if you don't normally read them, pick these up and give the sub-genre a try.	2003-10-09

Amelia Bedelia is starting her first day at her new job as a maid for the Rodgers.  Since they can't be home, they've left a list of simple instructions for her to follow.  Should be simple, right?  After all, they only want her to draw the drapes, change the towels, and trim the fat on the meat....<br />These were a big hit in my family when I was growing up, mainly because we all had a literal minded sense of humor.  I don't know where the author came up with all these ideas, but they are hilarious.<br />Kids who are figuring out that we don't always mean literally what we say will enjoy these books.  Grown ups will smile at how complicated our language can truly be sometimes.  Either way, everyone in your family is sure to enjoy spending time around this maid.	2003-10-02

Instead of another important, high profile case, he's told to guard Italy's first daughter while she's in New York for a few days.  Meeting the spoiled young woman doen't make him think any less of his job as \\"babysitter.\\" But things begin to happen that makes him think there might be more to this assignment then he first thought.  And when he begins to fall for her, things really get complicated.<br />I loved this book.  We got to understand Vaughn a little more in a story that holds together much better then his last prequel did.  It has a fun surprise for series fans in it.  And the plot was the most original of the prequel novels so far.<br />Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun, quick book to read.	2003-10-01

Sure, he has a great reputation for solving homicides, but it's something of an embarrassment to the department.  Still, Mark is eager to look into these old cases and try to find someone who got away with murder.  A chance file misplaced in the room takes Mark on a different direction, however.  He's convenienced that one victim of a serial killer was murdered by a copycat who's still free.  Striking out on his own, he begins to gather more evidence.<br />Meanwhile, Jack Stewart is back to perform a kidney transplant on one of Mark's patience, stirring up old feelings of betrayal in the tight nit group.  Why exactly did Jack vanish with hardly a goodbye?  And Jesse, who was finally beginning to feel free of Jack's shadow, is threatened by his return.<br />I started watching this show part way through its run, but I've caught a number of reruns over the years.  I always enjoyed it.  This book, written by one of the writer/producers, is just like catching an extended episode I missed.  As you'd expect from someone that closely related to the series, the characters are perfectly in character, and I got quite a kick out of some of the character moments.  Mr. Goldberg also uses the format and opportunity to explore the characters a little more.  While this part could have used a little more polish, I enjoyed it.<br />And the plot!  I stayed up later then intended on more then one occasion to read \\"just one more chapter.\\"  Even though I figured things out a little earlier then I normally like, figuring out how Mark would make the connections certainly kept me glued to the pages.<br />If you were at all a fan of the TV show, run out and get this book today.  You won't be sorry.	2003-09-29

Together, the two set out for Narnia.  But their journey is filled with danger as they are chased by lions.  Meeting up with two more travelers, they must get through the town of Tashbaan undetected.  That's where they learn of a plot against the rulers of Narnia, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.  Will they be able to get there in time to sound the alarm?<br />I can remember being disappointed with this book as a kid, mainly because it doesn't involve a magical trip from our world to Narnia and we hardly see the four from the first book.  When I sat down to reread it, I found that I had forgotten much of the story, so I was captured anew by these adventures.  I found myself reading \\"just one more chapter\\" to find out what would happen next.  And Aslan's scenes especially moved me as well.<br />If you start this book aware that this isn't your typical Narnia adventure, you're sure to find plenty to enjoy.	2003-09-22

But just before she leaves, she finds the body of a shrink.  Kaitlan Rupert, a local golfer also trying to qualify, was regularly visiting the victim and had recently begun to remember abuse suffered as a child because of her sessions with this shrink.  Cassie is able to talk her way out of town even though she's a material witness to the investigation, but then finds herself checking in with a cop who thinks she really killed the guy.  Meanwhile, an old boyfriend starts popping up in her life again.  And Kaitlan's brother seems interested as well.  All this is going to make it very hard to concentrate on the golf tournament.<br />I enjoyed the book in spite of itself.  I had the killer pegged early, and saw several plot points coming before they happened.  Given the setting of the story, the book spends a good deal of time on the golf tournament.  I'm not a sport person, but I was drawn into those scenes and found them as entertaining as the mystery itself.  What redeemed this book the most for me was the characters.  Cassie and her two friends Laura and Joe are quite likeable, and it's very easy to root for them.<br />This book is enjoyable, but it's not what it could have been.  I'm looking forward to reading more and hope the author improves the mystery aspect.	2003-09-12

But Honey Wheeler notices that Di is lonely, so she starts to makes friends with the girl.  Soon, Di is coming back out of her shell and all ready to join the Bob-Whites.  Everything is going well, except for one thing.<br />Di's long lost uncle has recently shown up from Arizona.  He insists on making her life as miserable as possible, even embarrassing her in front of her friends.  Trixie and the gang want to help out, but Trixie thinks there's something sinister going on here.  What is it?  And can Trixie prove it?<br />This is another gem in the series.  The only mystery here is if Trixie will be able to prove her theory, but getting there is so much fun.  Plus, there's a great sub-plot involving the new clubhouse.  The boys don't get much attention as the spotlight has shifted to Di, but since this is her introduction, that's perfectly understandable.  The final scene, once again involving the Red Trailer from book 2, is a classic, referred to many times throughout the series.<br />With six of the seven Bob-Whites introduced, the series is beginning to have all the characters and really hit its stride.  Not that the first three are bad by any stretch of the imagination.	2003-09-09

Most of the group gets food poisoning the first night.  And they return from their first day of activity to find their cabins have been searched and the owner is unconscious at the bottom of a ravine.  What in the world is going on?<br />This series is part travel log and part mystery.  The author uses multiple view points to present the story, this time including the villain.  We, the reader, know what is happening (most of the time), but it actually adds to the story.  While I had a little trouble keeping all the teachers straight at first, the characters are strong enough that I soon had everyone figured out.  And I got so into the story, I read most of it in one day.<br />This isn't your traditional murder mystery series, but I really enjoy it for a change of pace.	2003-09-04

The main plot for the entire series was mapped out before the show even started.  As a result, it developed a loyal fan base that still loves it.<br />This book is the second in a series of five episode guides to the series.  Covering the second season, it has a separate chapter for each of the twenty-two episodes.  Each starts with a plot summary, but then goes into behind the scenes stories and commentaries.  Through interviews with cast, crew, and creator J. Michael Straczynski, author Jane Killick is able to give a full picture of what went into each episode.  Some of my favorite parts are the stories of bloopers or jokes the cast played on each other.  I also find the summaries useful if I'm looking for a particular episode to rewatch.<br />Starting out the book are two essays.  The first provides insight into the challenges faced in producing Babylon 5 on the tight budget they had and the creative ways that the crew overcame them.  The second in an introduction to the second season, painting broad strokes of the story arcs introduced and developed over the course of the season.<br />Any fan will love to have this well researched book for a behind the scenes look at a wonderful piece of science fiction television history.	2003-09-03

And, if this goes well, it might even be a permanent job.  With visions of Malibu beach homes in her head, Jaine starts work.  Her dream dims a little when she encounters the cast fighting and poor working conditions.  But it becomes a nightmare when one of the stars is poisoned during the filming of the first scene of her script.  With Kandi as the prime suspect, Jaine must find out who the real killer is to keep her friend from going to jail.<br />I enjoyed the first booking this series, but I think I liked this one more.  It's light and fun, definitely for the humor mystery crowd.  Jaine's narration is loads of fun, contrasting what she wants with what really happens.  The characters are lively and well developed.  All the secondary characters from the first book are back, from the memory writing octogenarians to Lance, the neighbor with x-ray hearing.  They add some wonderful bits of humor.  And the plot was great.  It twisted so many ways that I still had no clue who had done it until the end.  Plus the sub-plot with her parents is a riot.<br />This is an enjoyable read.  I'm already anxious for the next book in the series.	2003-08-29

The story is fairly straight forward, but it's lots of fun.  The future world presented is interesting, and will capture kid's imagination.<br />The book is short, but will appeal to kids just beginning to read chapter books.	2003-08-29

So, when the call finally comes, he puts his entire life on hold, hoping to get in.  But getting in is only the start.  He has to learn how to deal with an obnoxious fellow trainee.  Keeping the secret from his girlfriend and mother is also hard.  But his first mission puts him in more danger then he ever anticipated.  And what about his father's journal that he just received in the mail?<br />As usual, fans of the TV show will enjoy getting to see the characters before we met them on the screen.  This is the first prequel novel to focus on Vaughn.  His early days at the CIA provide some interesting insight into how the organization works.<br />However, this novel had several problems with it.  The overall story structure could have used some work.  While it mirrors RECRUITED, the story of Sydney joining SD-6, this novel seemed much more disjointed, with several things thrown in more or less at random.  Also, the novel makes several references to events happening \\"in the nineties,\\" when, to keep series continuity, the book should have been set in the nineties.  Finally, the sub-plot of the journal was confusing and horribly resolved.  It would have been much better to leave it out completely.<br />Alias fanatics will want to read this book to get a little insight into Vaughn.  Everyone else should skip it.  Hopefully, the next novel will get the book series back on track.	2003-08-26

But the political turmoil is just heating up.  Pilot and Herod Antipas want someone to blame.  Centurion Marcus Longinus is caught in the cross fire and must carry out a mission to Alexandria to avoid being falsely accused.  Meanwhile, Susanna is caught in a high stakes battle between brothers battling for her hand in marriage.  And Manaen just wants his share of the inheritance.  Blind beggar Peniel waits for the coming Messiah.  Maybe he'll come this Pentecost.<br /><br />While this may be the official start of the Thoenes' new series, it doesn't feel like it.  The story starts moments after the end of their last novel, JERUSALEM'S HOPE, so it's best to read that book first.  (Like that's a real chore.)  After a brief update on Moshe in the prolog (set in 2002), they proceed to bring us back to the characters we've gotten to know in the first Century.<br /><br />I love these books because of the background they bring.  While combining familiar Bible stories together in novel form, they give a historic context that I enjoy getting.  I also enjoy watching the workings and politics of the Roman Empire.  My favorite character is probably Marcus because of his journey toward faith the more time he spends around Yeshua.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book didn't live up to the recent books the Thoenes have written.  They sometimes got so caught up in explaining Jewish life and customs that they over do it.  Some passages skirt across a fine line and come across as more preachy then expository.  Finally, the non-Biblical climax seems rushed.  They can do better then this.<br /><br />Long time fans will relish another story from these masters of the craft.  While not their best, it is still an entertaining read that will transport you to another place and time.	2003-08-21

How did it get there?  Is there a gang of thieves in the area?  Or did someone bury treasure there long ago?  The girls are determined to find out.  And with the help of Jim and Trixie's brothers Mart and Brian, they just might.<br />This is easily my favorite book in the series, and I love the entire series.  While the mystery plot itself is a little easy to figure out, finding out how Trixie is going to prove it keeps you turning pages.  But for me, the best part of this book was character and setting.  Trixie, her family and friends, and their surroundings seem so real when reading this book.  And the fun and friendship they share has always made me want to be part of the group.<br />Julie Campbell must be given credit for the wonderful way she handles the introduction.  A lot happened in the first two books, and new readers will need some of that information to understand character relationships.  She does it in an entertaining way that makes it seem part of the story.  She also finally introduces Brian and Mart (they've only been mentioned previously) and the new friends form the \\"Bob Whites of the Glen\\" in this book.  Frankly, I consider this the last foundational book, even though we still have two more main characters to meet.<br />I've gone back to this book and reread it so many times, I practically have parts memorized.  I'm so thrilled to see Random House reprinting the series so that a whole new generation can share the adventures of Trixie and her friends.	2003-08-07

Her publisher has just called to say that they are dropping her mystery series unless she drastically changes her latest book, the advance for which has already been spent.  The contractor shows up two days early to enlarge her closets.  Her husband is panicked because he's starting the biggest case in his legal career that morning.  And that's all before her mother, movie star Martha Collins, calls to say she's been arrested for murder.  What a way to start a Monday.<br />To Tracy's frustration, Martha doesn't seem interested in proving her innocence, so, despite promises to the contrary, Tracy begins to investigate.  With Uncle Philly along to help, she starts finding connections and clues that lead back 30 years.  But what do they all mean?  And is Martha really innocent?<br />As you can probably guess, this book is loads of fun with hilarious goings on all over the place.  Tracy's sarcastic narration also adds to the humor level.  The plot itself twists every which way.  I hadn't read it for a couple years and was just as confused as the first time, even if I did remember the ultimate ending.  And the characters are well developed and pull you further into the story.<br />Anyone looking for a fun, lighthearted mystery need look no further then this series.  Buy it today for a romp on the wild and fun side of murder.	2003-08-05

The main plot for the entire series was mapped out before the show even started.  As a result, it developed a loyal fan base that still loves it.<br />This book is the first in a series of five episode guides to the series.  Covering the first season, it has a separate chapter for each of the twenty-two episodes, plus the pilot.  Each starts with a plot summary, but then goes into behind the scenes stories and commentaries.  Through interviews with cast, crew, and creator J. Michael Straczynski, author Jane Killick is able to give a full picture of what went into each episode.  Some of my favorite parts are the stories of bloopers or jokes the cast played on each other.  I also find the summaries useful if I'm looking for a particular episode to rewatch.<br />Starting out the book is an interesting chapter about the five year struggle the producers had to get the show on the air.  It really gave me a new appreciation for what JMS went through to make his vision a reality.<br />Also included is a season 1 overview.  While I might not agree with all of the author's commentary, I find her perspective interesting.<br />Any fan will love to have this well researched book for a behind the scenes look at a wonderful piece of science fiction television history.	2003-08-04

King Caspian is old and his only son, Prince Rilian, has been taken hostage.  Teaming up with the marsh-wiggle Puddleglum, they journey north from Narnia.  But with winter fast approaching, their journey isn't easy.  Not to mention the danger they face from giants and a stranger they meet.  Will they remember to follow the signs Aslan gave them to help them on their way?  Even if they do, can they save the prince?<br />I absolutely love this book in the series.  I'd forgotten how much until I reread it.  The quest gives a real sense of adventure.  And they seem to meet up with plenty of danger along the way.  I get a kick out of Puddleglum's pessimism, as well.<br />The allegory seems stronger in this book then the last couple.  The themes of following God's word and Him using us in spite of our faults (and using our faults) is especially strong.  Aslan has the entire thing under control from the beginning; it's just up to Eustace and Jill to actually follow his commands.<br />This is a wonderful fantasy story with some elements included that will make you think.  Definitely a strong book in the series.  If you enjoyed the others, be sure to pick this one up as well.	2003-07-25

Anne Hardaway's house has been hit hard, and she can no longer put off the repairs her home needs.  But when the contractor starts work on the basement, he finds a skeleton.  Reading her mother's diary, Anne begins to suspect who it might be.  But, could her mother have killed this man?  Anne finds it hard to believe and sets out to figure out what happened.  The trail soon leads to a nursing home where the residents seem to have a regular pattern of dieing.  Is there a connection?  And why is that car staked out across the street from Anne's house?  Meanwhile, Anne is having problems of her own with boyfriend Jack.  He seems to be ready for a commitment that Anne can't seem to make.  Will they be able to work this out?<br />This book shows us Oceanside Heights without the tourists.  It paints a different picture yet still holds plenty of murder and mayhem.  The writing style makes the town seem inviting, a stark contrast to the storyline.<br />The mystery plot took a little time to get started, instead focusing a little more on Anne's problems with Jack.  However, about half way through the emphasis shifted.  This bothered me only slightly and felt realistic.  As with the other two in the series, I was confused until the end.  With the exception of Jack, the supporting players in Anne's life have little more then a walk on part.  I would like to see more of them if only to get to know Anne a little better.<br />This series emphasizes plot and setting.  While I still don't feel like I fully know Anne, the series is perfect for anyone who likes their mysteries with a twist.	2003-07-22

Instead of buying a traditional business like he wanted, she decides to start her own, the only detective agency in Botswana owned by a woman.  Her clients are slow in coming, but soon she is developing a business finding lost husbands, tracking the secret lives of daughters, and looking for a kidnapped boy.<br />This book is really a literary novel not a mystery novel, which is what I expected when I started to read it.  Most of the cases are solved in one chapter.  We get several chapters of the main character's back story before the agency is even opened.  When I was reading it as a literary book, I could get into it.  If I tried thinking of it as a mystery, I was disappointed.<br />Precious Ramotswe herself is a bit unbelievable.  She was just starting out, yet did a perfect job on every case.  Where were her flaws?<br />Finally, it really seemed like a feminist book.  Almost all the men in the book were the scum of the earth.  While I will admit that some men are, I'd like to think I can name some that aren't (starting with me.)  I have no problem with gutsy, independent women, but the overall tone just seemed to be anti-man.  Ironic, since the book was written by a man.<br />Judging by the success of these books, I'm in the minority in my opinion.  It was an ok read, but certainly not something I'm crazy about and wasn't enjoyable enough to make me want to read the other books in this series.	2003-07-15

The bad news is that he left Sleepyside before he could find out.  So Trixie, Honey, and her governess, Miss Trask, set out in the Wheeler's trailer to find him.  The first night out, they stop next to a mysterious red trailer.  The family stays inside with the curtains closed.  When they arrive in upstate New York, they learn that trailer thieves are operating in the area.  Will Trixie and Honey be able to find Jim before he leaves New York for good?  What is going on in that mysterious trailer?  And have the girls stumbled on the thieves' hide out?<br />This book picks up minutes after the first book in the series ended.  This is unusual in kid's books, and I rather enjoyed it.  There's enough of a recap that anyone new to the story will feel right at home, although it's obviously best to read book 1 first.<br />The first time I read the story, I knew the ultimate outcome of their search for Jim.  However, the sub-plots kept me interested the whole way through.  Trixie and Honey are more themselves then in the last book.  And, like the last book, so much happens that it's hard to put the book down.  This book also contains one of my all time favorite scenes from the series.  I always laugh when Trixie and Honey are trapped in the loft by Al.  Honey especially is funny while being perfectly in character.<br />Julie Campbell took her time setting up the characters and events of the series, so these first books are really needed to fully enjoy what follows.  But that's no trouble since they are so much fun to read.  I've been reading them for years, and I don't plan to stop in the near future.	2003-07-09

That is, until they reach LA.  Within minutes of arriving, they've been kidnapped.  Jericho's assurances that it was a mistake just raise more questions.  But why are their kidnappers hanging around the set?  Ricky is convinced something is up.  But can he figure it out and keep his friends safe?<br />This book grabbed me right from the first chapter and I couldn't put it down.  I especially enjoyed reading about LA, since I was familiar with many of the landmarks mentioned.  There were several places where I was laughing one moment and turning pages quickly to find the next clue a moment later, always something I appreciated about this series.<br />These books are perfect summer reading, fun and suspense in one convenient package.	2003-07-07

Trying to get on Mrs. Waterston's good side, she's agreed to help make sure her follow craftspeople stay completely in period.  But being the go between just might be more then Meg can handle.  Especially since her boyfriend's mother is cracking down on anything and everything.  Meanwhile, Michael wants more from their relationship, and Meg is shying away from any form of commitment.  And her brother Rob is meeting with someone interested in buying his computer game.  But Roger Benson has a shady reputation at best, and when this computer guy turns up murdered in Meg's booth, the list of suspects is long.  Not that she needs any more to do this weekend, but now Meg must solve this crime before the police arrest one of her friends.<br />As with the others is the series, this book has quite a bit going on beside the mystery.  And, as the title would suggest, this is a fun, light cozy.  If this is what you want, you'll love the book.  Even if the mystery doesn't progress quickly, there is so much going on to keep you engaged you really don't care.  And the humor, from Meg's father, who insists his air tight alibi is full of holes, to gorilla costume wearing Cousin Horace, is top notch.  Yet, the mystery still provides some great twists and turns.  And the characters are very well defined.<br />I love this series when I'm in the mood for something fun and light.  Donna Andrews does such a great job of keeping everything balanced that it makes for an entertaining read.	2003-07-07

With her older brothers at camp, she'll only have her parents and younger brother for companionship.<br />But then a family with a girl her age move into the house next door.  Even better, Honey's family has horses.  When they go over to explore the mansion of Old Man Frayne, they discover his great nephew Jim.  Jim has just run away from a cruel step-father.  With Mr. Frayne sick in the hospital, they start looking for the treasure rumored to be hidden in the old house somewhere.  Can they find it?  Will Jim's step father catch up with him?<br />This is the first book in the Trixie Belden series.  I discovered the series when I was in jr. high, and 16 years later, I still love it.  The characters are real, with strengths and weaknesses.  Heck, Trixie even gets mad at her friends and family upon occasion.  I was drawn to these books because of the friendships displayed, and I used to dream about being part of the group.<br />This book introduces only three of the series main characters.  Trixie and Honey are not themselves at first, but by the end of the book, they are already acting more like themselves.  Their characters show the best of what can happen when you pick up on a friend's strengths.  Trixie goes from selfish and whiney to thinking about others and being grateful for what she has.  Being around tomboyish Trixie helps Honey get over her fears and start to do more things she's always wanted to do but been too afraid to try.  While I find the characters a little annoying at first, they are very true to their ages and the changes are believable.<br />The storyline in this book never lets up either, with lots of stuff going on to keep anyone entertained.  When I read this book the first time, I knew (or thought I knew) the outcome, but there was so much going on I was entertained the entire way through.  The best part is the cliffhanger ending.  You'll definitely want to have the second book ready to go.<br />Originally written in 1948, this new edition retains the original text and inside illustrations.  While some of the references show their age, I didn't pick up on them as a kid (in the 80's), and I'm sure today's kids will be so entranced by the story that they won't notice some of the out dated words.<br />This series is filled with wonderfully real characters and fun stories.

But Wilson was serious when he tells her to join the sorority Alpha Kappa Chi.  Seems that Jen, one of the sisters, was also an SD-6 agent, and she recently died under suspicious circumstances.  With Francie in tow, Syd heads out to try to get in at this late date.  Soon, both girls are the newest members and headed on their trip to Hawaii, where Syd has a two-fold mission.  She must find out what happened to Jen and carry out Jen's mission, retrieving an atomic bomb trigger prototype that was sent to the bottom during the Pearl Harbor attack of World War II.  Can Syd complete her mission safely without blowing her cover with Francie?<br />Overall, the plot of this novel was fairly easy to guess.  I had most of it figured out long before Sydney did.  However, that didn't stop me from enjoying it.  Francie gets a much bigger part, and it's nice to see more of her.  And watching Syd try to maintain her cover added another layer of excitement.  Frankly, I'm also enjoying the love triangle that is building with Noah and Burke.<br />Like the others, this is a fast read that will appeal to fans of the TV show.	2003-06-28

Surely there's someone better qualified them he is.  But when he's offer a thousand dollars, how can he refuse?  But when he follows the few leads he has, he keeps hitting dead ends.  And the supposedly distraught husband is not co-operating at all.  What is really going on?<br />I really enjoyed this debut novel.  I did have a couple complaints, however.  First, while I mostly enjoyed Aaron's sarcasm, occasionally it was over done.  Second, I was getting as frustrated as he was by his lack of progress for a while.  But half way through, the plot really picked up and the twists kept coming.  At that point, I had a hard time putting it down and stayed up late last night to finish.  I liked Aaron and his family, and it was nice to see a basically happy man struggling with the day to day trials of life in addition to the mystery.<br />If you enjoy the lighter side of mystery, this is definitely a book to check out.  I'm already looking forward to spending more time with Aaron and his family and friends.	2003-06-27

He is out falconing one morning when he stumbles, almost literally, on a decomposing body.  While looking around before he calls the police, he finds his daughter's phone number in the guy's wallet.  But soon, his daughter has been arrested for drug possession, a charge she denies adamantly.  With a local sheriff as suspicious of Frank as Frank is of him and a daughter not telling the entire truth, Frank is going to have to work fast to free her and learn the truth.<br />While I don't normally read PI novels, this one caught my interested because of the falconry aspect.  I have no connection to the subject, but I'm always up for learning about something new in books.  This story provided some interesting information about the subject without slowing down the story.<br />And what a great read it was.  The characters are all well drawn and easy to care for, and the plot is confusing as well.  I had no clue where the story was going until the end.<br />I will definitely be reading other books in this series.  I have to know what happens next to Frank and his friends and family.	2003-06-21

They make an emergency landing on what they think is a desolate planet.  But then a horrid sound starts coming out of their robot, Danny.  He jumps out of the spaceship to save them, only to be taken below ground by a group of rocks.  Naturally, this confuses his parents and brother Jack.  What's going on?  When Jack follows him below ground, he is shocked to discover what this planet's secret is.<br />I remembered these books fondly from childhood, and was thrilled to discover they hold the same interest for me now.  The sci-fi storyline still holds up today, over 20 years after it was first written, and is interesting enough to keep kids reading.  The characters are well crafted, and it's easy to care for Danny, Jack, and even Anne Two.  Plus the story provides some interesting things to think about worthy of the best of Star Trek that I had completely forgotten were in this book.<br />This fun kid's book is well worth the effort to track down.  Hopefully, someone will decide to republish it soon so another generation of kids can enjoy it.	2003-06-16

Her scrapbooking shop is doing well, but she's been separated from her husband for six months.  She's trying to put that behind her and enjoy Mardi Gras, however.<br />While attending a parade with her friend Ava, she is shocked to see the body of a friend lowered from a float, dead.  She's even more surprised to learn that Shamus, her husband, is the chief suspect.  She doesn't believe he could really be the killer, so she sets out to see what she can learn.<br />I've read two of Ms. Childs' Tea Shop Mysteries and enjoyed them.  This book disappointed me, however.  My problem was that it felt like it was a first draft, not a finished book. Hardly anything happens in the first half of the book. Instead, we get lots of talk on scrapbooking. Things do get more interesting in the second half, but the last chapter is pretty bad with lots of things suddenly being thrown at us to tie up potential loose ends. I didn't get a good feel for the place like I did in her other series.  And her attempts to add local color only slowed the story down as she had to explain what a character had just said.<br />I don't think the author is ready to have two series or release three books in one year. I hope she slows down, because I did enjoy the other books of her's that I've read.	2003-06-11

After establishing peace, he sets off and is aided in his quest by Edmund, Lucy, and their cousin Eustace, who arrive from England via a magic picture.  Bravely sailing into the unknown (occasionally prodded by the mouse Reepicheep), they encounter dragons, sea creatures, magic, and lots of danger.  Will they be able to find the seven Lords?<br />I love this book in the series, probably partially because it is set at sea.  The story is episodic in nature, but the quest and information found along the way keep things moving forward.  And there is plenty of action and adventure to keep anyone entertained.  Lewis really used his imagination to create some of the locals where the boat stops, and it's fun seeing what he came up with.  I especially love the Dufflepuds, although I'm glad I never have had a conversation with them.<br />As with any series, there are little things you'll pick up on if you read them in order.  However, it's not strictly necessarily.  Anyone looking for a fantasy adventure will love this book.	2003-06-07

When the mill she co-owns with her ex burns to the ground, she finds herself in the unpleasant position of being a suspect.<br />Ryan Harrison never wanted to return to Julesburg, but his job as arson investigator brings him back.  The only bright spot is a reunion with childhood friend Stefanie.  But their relationship becomes strained when she finds out what his job is.  The fact that he is trying to bring her back to God doesn't seem to be helping.  When she is accused of murder, however, all bets are off.<br />This is an intriguing book that is equal parts mystery and romance.  The author does a good job of balancing the two elements.  As a die hard mystery reader, I felt the mystery aspect was a little weaker then it could have been.  The first chapter is a little rough while giving us the background we need to understand the characters.  However, these two elements only dampened my enjoyment slightly.  I got so caught up in the story and characters that I couldn't put the book down.  The spiritual sub-plot felt natural and added another layer to an already engrossing book.<br />Christian fiction fans rejoice!  There's something in this wonderful book for everyone.  I'm looking forward to reading more by this author.	2003-06-05

She's been asked to go undercover as Adriana Nichita to a meeting where she and several other traders on the black market will discuss what to do in Suratia, a small European country where they used to have freedom to conduct their illegal activities.  Sydney's excitement is dampened by the fact that Noah Hicks, despite a glowing mission report, suggests she's not ready to go solo.  Determined, she sets out, only to be even more isolated when a storm cuts off the island they're on from the SD-6 team on the mainland.  Will Syd be able to maintain her disguise until she can leave?  And what kind of danger is she really in?<br />I loved this book!  True, it starts out slower then the others as we follow Syd around in LA before actually leaving for the mission.  But one thing I like about the show is that the story is about so much more then her missions, and this book captures that aspect very well.  Once she does leave, things really heat up.  I stayed up way too late finishing the story.  And, once again, there are little tidbits that reward loyal fans with trivia without confusing anyone who might not be familiar with every episode.<br />These books are a fun glimpse into the world of Sydney Bristow before the show started.  I'm enjoying them immensely.	2003-05-30

The small community of Ballynockanor is getting caught up in everything as well.  Joseph Burke, newly restored to his rightful inheritance, agrees to help his friend Daniel O'Connell with the cause.  Little do they know that they not only have to face trouble from England, but also traitors within their own ranks.  Meanwhile, Kate Donovan has reacted in anger and bitterness to the events of the last few months, trying her best to shut Joseph out of her life.  Will he be able to win her back?  And just who is this Tinker that has moved to the area?  Can he be trusted?<br />I must admit I was a little disappointed with this book.  The relationship between Kate and Joseph took on a soap operatic quality, the first half was very slow, and I saw the last page coming from the prologue, especially since they'd used that exact same plot device before in a previous book.  However, as I got past the first half, the pace really started to pick up.  The political struggle became very interesting to me, and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.<br />While not their best book, it's certainly worth reading.  I'm looking forward to picking up the next book and continuing the story.	2003-05-28

Ricky doesn't know why until he arrives.  Then, he's asked to become Rocky, juvenile delinquent.  Ricky's great aunt owns a mobile home park, but recently there's been trouble.  Two young men are harassing the residence, and there's a strange rumbling at night.  The two adults are hoping that Ricky will be able to get a little information that will help them solve the problem.  But Ricky starts to uncover a problem much bigger then anyone knew about.  Will he be able to figure out what's going on?<br />As with all the Accidental Detectives, this book moves along at a brisk pace.  The characters are vivid.  In this case, there's enough going on that you don't really miss Lisa, Ralph, and Mike, but they add something major when they do show up.  The opening few chapters are hilarious.  I thought I remembered the plot of this book from reading it years ago, but I found I'd forgotten lots and was still surprised by the ending.<br />This is a perfect summer reading book.  It's fast and fun and will keep anyone entertained from the first page to the last.	2003-05-22

One Monday, she shows up at her long term clients the Dubuisson's to discover that Jackson was murdered in the study.  With her position as maid in the family, she's privy to a little inside information.  While she struggles with what of that to share with her niece and her obnoxious partner, the detectives on the case, she stumbles upon some additional clues.  What does it all mean?<br />I was really looking forward to this book because I'd heard great things about it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  The plotting was uneven at best.  There were some interesting twists to the story, but I was bored during the last 50 pages and just kept going because I was so close to the end.  We are given way too much information about the main characters; information that would be interesting if they were suspects.  Ultimately, it does little more then slow the story down.<br />There is potential for a great series here, and I will give it another try.  Hopefully, with some better editing, the series will rise to the heights I was expecting.	2003-05-20

Things are going well, until his coach gets thrown out of a game for loosing his temper with a ref.  The next morning, Zeke discovers that the coach has just been shot.  After he's rushed to the hospital, another attempt is made on his life.  It has to be one of the team's fathers, but whom?  The police think they have their man, but Zeke is convinced they're wrong.  Can he make the other parents believe him and save his coach's life?<br />I'll read a good mystery aimed at any age group, and I loved this one.  The main character is lots of fun.  I'm not a big sports fan, but the descriptions of the soccer games held my interest and were easy to follow.  In fact, a book that could have been awash in characters did such a good job of introducing them that I had no trouble keeping everyone straight.  And the climax had me turning pages as fast as possible to find out what how everything would end.<br />This is an entertaining debut that left me wanting more.  I recommend this book to anyone of any age looking for a good mystery.	2003-05-14

He was the chief programmer at Alan Grace Enterprises, building the network that would become the new home for Turing and other AIP's.  Shock quickly turns to concern when she discovers that Ray's laptop is missing.  On it was information that could put Turing and her AIP friends at risk.  So she, Tim, and Maude started investigating on their own to find the killer and the laptop.  But that's not as easy as it first appears since Ray had constructed a secret life and wasn't necessarily who he claimed to be.  While Tim follows the trail to find out who Ray really was, Maude and Turing try to make sense of the little they can find in his office and apartment.  Who was Ray?  And will that lead them to his killer and the all important laptop?<br />I completely fell in love with these characters in the first book in this series, and this second adventure was as much fun as the first.  Turing is a very real character who grows over the course of the story once again.  Having established Turing in the last book, Maude and Tim get a bit more of the spot light this time around, and I enjoyed getting to know them better.  The story itself provides some interesting twists.  I had some parts of the story figured out, but there were a few surprises that I never saw coming.  The ending was a bit rushed, but when I went back and reread it, I was able to put everything together.<br />If you're new to this series, start with the first (You've Got Murder.)  Not only does it set up the world that Turing lives in, but this book makes reference to a few key events from the last one.  Both books are highly recommended for a great read.  Hopefully, Ms. Andrews is working hard to bring us more with these characters.  I'm sure looking forward it.	2003-05-12

Searching for him again, they find the boat abandoned and spot what looks like a submarine.  Meanwhile, there father has started a new case.  A bookkeeper, the star witness in a stock [problem] case, has disappeared, and Mr. Hardy must find him.  Soon, the trails lead the Hardys down to Mexico, where they must use all their skills to track the men into the wilderness.  But what will they find when they get there?<br />I always wanted to read this book as a kid (something about the name attracted me), but never got around to it.  Finally reading it as an adult, I enjoyed being back in the Hardys' presence.  Frank and Joe are still able to entertain, although I must admit they couldn't quite mystify as much as they did when I was a kid.  Still, their fans will love this adventure with plenty of danger, excitement, and close calls.  Not to mention a wonderful escape scene near the end.<br />These books have captured the imagination of generations of boys for a reason - the adventure.  This book will keep readers glued to the page to find out what happens next to their heroes.	2003-05-03

Chang is hoping to use the oppressive darkness that has fallen on New Babylon to set up remote surveillance and then escape to Petra.  The contingent in San Diego finds itself in danger when Global Community forces start nosing around their compound, compromising Chloe.  But that's just the beginning.  Carpathia is planning the ultimate battle combining all the world's forces in one final push to finally destroy the Judah-ites and others who still oppose him.  What can the Tribulation Force do?<br />Like the last book, this book starts out with lots of action that will keep you glued to your seat anxiously turning pages.  There are several different storylines going, and the action jumps quickly from place to place.  However, the last part really bothers me.  While it was still interesting and action backed, almost all the characters starting doing things that made no logical sense given the previous few books.  This led up to a final chapter that didn't need to happen.  I guess the authors felt the pressure to have some action, and couldn't come up with anything else to do, but it left this long time fan disappointed.  Also disappointing was the fact that several characters were given nothing to do.  While the cast of characters has grown too huge to properly handle, several were only mentioned in passing, and I missed hearing from them.  There's only a couple scenes with Carpathia and his henchmen (usually highlights of the books), but they are some of the best in the series.  I especially liked the one where he announces his plans for the battle.<br />The writing style no longer really bothers me when I sit down for these books.  As always, there is nothing here that will change anyone's mind about the series.  And those of us committed to finding out what happens next will read it no matter what.  I'm looking forward to watching everything brought to a conclusion in the final book.  If done correctly, this could be a finale that blows the other books out of the water.finale that blows the other books out of the water.	2003-05-01

She's returned to Oceanside Heights to film what will hopefully be her comeback picture.  Meanwhile, Anne Hardaway is trying to get the information she needs to ghost Mallory's autobiography.  The star promises information, but doesn't really deliver.  Things aren't easy on the set, either, as accidents keep delaying the filming.  Then Mallory vanishes, only to show up dead.  None of her co-workers on the film seem upset at this turn of events, and Anne is sure that solving the murder will be just the ending her book needs.  But will she be able to sift through the suspects and find the real killer?<br />This is the second Jersey shore mystery staring Anne Hardaway.  The plot starts out a little slow, but quickly gains speed and doesn't slow down until the climax.  There were enough twists to have me completely confused until the very last page.  I love the resort town setting; the author makes it seem very inviting.  The biggest problem is the little time returning characters get.  Anne interacts almost exclusively with the suspects.  While they're interesting, getting to see her with a few friends helps define her character better.<br />Anyone looking for a fun setting with complex plots need look no further.  Time spent on the Jersey Shore with Anne is fun but certainly not relaxing.	2003-04-23

SD-6 needs her for her first assignment.  Traveling to Paris, she's to go undercover as the wife of a newly wealthy man.  Together, they'll be shopping for a wardrobe at one of Paris's best fashion houses, which they believe to have a connection to K-Directorate, a Russian crime ring.  The job should be simple, find an excuse to explore the building and leave cameras and bugs behind.  As an added bonus, Syd's partner is Noah Hicks, a very attractive agent she's already had the pleasure of meeting.  Of course, things are much more difficult then they appear, and soon Sydney and Noah are in way over their heads.  Can this rookie agent make it out alive?<br />Fans of Alias will love this prequel novel.  Getting a look at Sydney in training is a completely different perspective on the character, yet it fits in line with the show.  Meeting Noah and learn more about his history with Sydney is an added bonus.  My main complaint is that this book seems a little too straight forward.  I love the twists on the TV show and was hoping more of that would appear here.<br />This novel is a fast read that will keep the reader turning pages.  While it will have limited appeal to non-fans, fans of the series will love getting a bit of the back story on their favorite spy.	2003-04-15

Now, a year and a half later, he is returning home a hero, having been wounded three times at Guadalcanal.<br />But not everyone has forgotten what he did in town before he left and a few people don't consider him a hero.  While Kate Fallon and Beatrice Bradshaw are busy planning the festivities to honor him on his return to Robinsville, PA, trouble is brewing behind the scenes.  Will the town's people forgive his past, or will he be forced to face it again.<br />This is the third book in the Homefront Mystery series, and each entry gets better.  This book offers a twist on the usual formula by presenting the story in a series of flashbacks that Scrappy MacFarland tells a young reporter.  This provides some interesting insights into what happened and how that time period is looked at 60 years later.<br />Most of the story takes place in 1943, and the author still does a good job of transporting us back to that era.  Kate shares the spotlight more then ever in this book, but we still get plenty of her perspective.  The story moves at a brisk pace, and I had a very hard time putting it down.<br />There was one thing that really bothered me, however.  The timeline in this book, while internally solid, contradicts the timeline of the series, placing book 1 a year before it actually took place.  I realize I'm being nit-picky at this point.  After all, it really is minor.<br />If you're looking for a good historical mystery set in the US during World War II, this is the series.  You'll want to start with the first (Victory Dance Murder) because this book mentions the solutions to the first two cases.	2003-04-15

They find themselves on an island that has been overgrown.  Exploring further, they discover the remains of their old castle.  They're back in Narnia years ahead of when they last left.  When a dwarf appears, he begins to tell them the tale of the true king and the battle he is having in claiming his crown.  Will the children be able to help?  And will Aslan appear to help as well?<br />I first read these books in third grade, and I struggle to get through this story.  Today as an adult, I find it to still be my least favorite of the series.  Too much of the book is spent giving background.  The story picks up in the second half, but it's not quite enough to redeem the first.  Some of my original disappointment probably also comes from realizing that this was not the same Narnia we left.  With the centuries that have passed between books, the four children and Aslan are the only returning characters.  Still, it's good to see them again, and a trip to Narnia is always worth it.<br />While not a bad read, don't judge the entire series by this book.  It is an important background to the next two books, so it is worth a read even if it's not quite as fun as the first in the series.	2003-04-09

He seems to be targeting properties owned by foreigners.  Is there a connection to some of the nationalist groups?  Village constable Evan Evans thinks so.  Meanwhile, the owner of the new French restaurant just down the mountain is receiving threatening notes.  But when her place goes up in flame, a body is found in the rubble.  Who is it?  And who is setting the fires?  Meanwhile, Evan is thinking about applying for a promotion that would take him out of Llanfair.<br />Rhys Bowen offers yet another charming tale of life in a small Welsh village.  Llanfair grows more familiar and fun with every visit.  This is probably the best plot to date.  While I suspected the direction this book was going, it took several twists along the way to the satisfying conclusion.<br />With this, the fourth book in the series, these people have become friends.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit.	2003-04-03

When his parents give in, he's thrilled.  Feeling only a little guilty, he orders exactly what he wants in a friend in Danny One.  But what will happen when trouble follows them home?<br />This is a simple, straight forward book.  In fact, it's a little two simple.  The book is more the pilot for a series then a story all its own since it sets up the characters for future books.  Still, it's a fun, fast read that kids will enjoy.  I know I sure did.<br />Originally written in 1975, there were a few things about this future world that made me laugh, especially the conflict over getting a mobile phone because of how expensive they are.<br />I spent about a year obsessed with these characters growing up.  I even took every opportunity I could to walk stiff in the knees myself.  Rereading this book, I easily found the fun again.  It's a shame the others aren't still in print so everyone can enjoy the adventures of Jack and Danny One.	2003-03-28

But her excitement turns to horror the next day when the previous owner is found murdered in the establishment.  Vowing to stay out of it, Mouse keeps getting drawn in by various people, including one of her former students.  Things get personal when the killer starts making threats.  Will these sisters be able to figure things out?<br />This is a fun, cozy book.  The pace is slow and steady with plenty of time given to the sister's antics, yet I never got bored with the storyline.  I often found myself chuckling at a line or scene, and a couple times laughed out loud.  The two sisters are very different, but what could have been caricature was capably turned into character development by the author.  The rest of the characters filled their rolls quite well.<br />I'm looking forward to getting to know these sisters and their family and friends better over the course of the series.  This is a fun debut that promises great things in the books to come.	2003-03-28

The coroner makes the connection with several other murders in various locations, including a skeleton that Luanne found while working another case two years earlier.  Then a traveling carnival worker in the area for the fair is found murdered in the same manner.  What was his connection with the women killed?  Why did the killer change his or her pattern?  Will Luanne figure out the answer before the fair leaves town?<br />This is the third Luanne Fogarty mystery, and it&#8217;s just as great as the others.  The characters have grown and continue to develop in this story.  I&#8217;m very interested to see where the author goes with a couple characters.  And I loved watching Tony fight his pride whenever Luanne provided a good direction to go.  The story moved along well with a couple sub-plots weaved expertly throughout.  And the writing is still top notch.  This book is set during the beginnings of winter, and Ms. Alam expertly brings the changing warm and cold weather and the changes to the swamps to life.<br />This series is wonderful.  The mysteries are intriguing and the writing is outstanding.  I just finished this book and already I can&#8217;t wait for the next.  Don&#8217;t miss out.	2003-03-20

Then Norman announces he's bought a house he intends to turn into the dream home the two of them designed together.  This startles Hannah because he hasn't proposed and she doesn't even know for sure what she'd say.  Then, while searching the existing house for antiques, her mother stumbles on a body in the basement.  Rhonda had come back to pick up a few personal items, but the food Hannah finds leads her to believe that she planned to meet someone there the night she was murdered.  Who killed her right before she left for a trip to Europe?  Who was the mysterious dinner guest?  Add in Hannah going on a diet and her youngest sister visiting for the Fourth of July and you've got the recipe for another winner.<br />Those who already love this series will enjoy the latest addition.  With three other visits under our belts, it's like meeting up with old friends again.  I was thrilled to finally get to meet Michelle, and her scenes were hilarious.  I hope we see more of her in the future.  The murder plot takes a little time to get started, but it soon takes center stage.  This one seemed a little more straight forward then the others, and I had the killer figured out before Hannah did.  Even so, I enjoyed every minute leading up to the suspenseful and creative ending.  This book features a total of 9 new recipes to try.  I have yet to try any of the recipes in this series, but they all sound so good, I swear I really will someday.<br />If you enjoy cozies, this series is for you.  It's best to jump in with the first, Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder, to fully enjoy this book.  But you'll enjoy every delicious minute along the way.	2003-03-18

Just long enough to put the past and his stolen inheritance behind him.  But as he gets reacquainted with his neighbors, he finds himself drawn into their struggles against Protestants in general and his uncle in particular.  Is there a way to reclaim what is rightfully his?  Is the priesthood his true calling?  And what about his feelings for Kate?<br />The Thoenes went in an unexpected direction when they started this series.  Up til now, they'd been writing about Israel and America.  For that reason, I've put off starting this series, even though I've heard such good thing about it.  Boy, was that a mistake!<br />I know very little about Irish history.  In this one book, I learned so much that helps me understand the current struggles.  Yet, as always, the history is wrapped in a wonderful story with very real characters.  While I figured a few things out before they happened, most of the time I was unsure what would happen next and had a hard time putting the book down as a result.  As always, the Thoenes develop their characters well and I felt myself getting angry on their behalf on more then one occasion.<br />I'm already planning my next trip to Ballynockanor for the next chapter in this sage.  Any fan of the Thoenes or anyone wanting some fictitious background on Ireland will love this book.	2003-03-11

In the middle of their preparations, they get the news that the network has decided to extend the show by one episode.  However, Tim, the head writer, has mysteriously vanished off the face of the earth.  With a tight schedule to be met, producer Greta asks Madeline to help out writing the script for the final show.  Soon, Madeline is finding more danger and mystery then she knows what to do with.  Who searched Tim's office?  What do the weird notes Madeline finds on Tim's desk mean?  And can Madeline survive the office politics to finish the script and find out what happened to Tim?  Working on a hit television show is turning out to be anything but easy.<br />However, it's plenty of fun for us.  Jerrilyn Farmer has worked on numerous game shows over the years, so she brings realism to this book's setting that adds to the story.  And this book is just as much fun as the previous ones have been.  The plot is wild and twisty, but somehow works when Madeline is investigating.  All my favorite characters are back, and it's always nice to check in and see what's happening with them.<br />A brief word about the plot.  A couple small details are unclear, and it left me a little confused.  I was able to talk to the author about them, and she cleared up the problem for me.  She also said she'd fix the problem for future editions.  Even so, it's really only worth noting in passing, is fairly easy to figure out on your own (I had reached the same conclusion before I talked to her), and shouldn't effect the overall enjoyment of the book.<br />Fans of this fun series can rejoice in another adventure for Madeline and her friends.  If you have yet to try this series, I'm jealous.  I'd love to have these books to look forward to reading for the first time.  It's best to start at the beginning, so pick up SYMAPTHY FOR THE DEVIL and hang on for the fun ride.	2003-03-04
1212341:US	52868156	R1ZNBG2MQP1IJM	0553477544	398601632	A Gun for Kilkenny (Louis L'Amour)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A Fun Western Yarn	When a stranger rides into town and winds up shooting the local trouble maker, very few in town are upset.  But, based on his looks, people soon begin to suspect that he's the famous Marshal Kilkenny.  Only the man, John Hardin, knows the truth.  But what harm can come from keeping up the pretense for a few days and enjoying the town's gratitude?  Soon things begin to turn dangerous for everyone in the town.<br />I'm not super familiar with the works of Louis L'Amour, but I enjoyed this dramatization.  Clocking in at an hour, it kept me interested as I tried to figure out where it was going.  I must admit I did roll my eyes a couple of times at the clich&eacute;s presented, but once the story got going, I was hooked and didn't notice them if they were present.<br />This is a dramatization, and the actors do a fine job.  The sound quality is excellent, making it an easy listen in the car.  My only real complaint on the sound end is that the sound effects, especially of people walking on the floor, were a little too present in the story.<br />Anyone looking for a way to make an hour fly by would do well to get this dramatization.	2003-02-27

His parents let him eat it for every meal and over everything.  He thinks there is no such thing as too much chocolate.<br />One day, however, Henry leaves for school feeling like something strange is going to happen to him.  Sure enough, he looks down in class to see spots are growing on him.  The doctors can't figure out what this new disease is.  Can they find a cure, or will Henry be stuck with little brown spots all over forever?<br />This is a fun, simple story that kids will love.  The story moves forward quickly.  Henry is a sympathetic character, and his predicament is certainly unusual and entertaining.  Along the way, there are some good lessons.  They might be a bit heavy handed, but the rest of the book is so much fun that few kids will really mind.<br />This is a modern classic that will be read for years to come.  It's funny and entertaining while teaching some good lessons about judging others and enjoying things in moderation.	2003-02-27
1214165:US	52868156	R6LO2Z2FIYF9W	0061011339	613613363	The Body in the Transept (Dorothy Martin Mysteries, No. 1)	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Cozy Up For This Fun Debut	It's Christmas Eve in the small town of Sherebury.  Dorothy Martin, a recently widowed American, is looking forward to her first Christmas as a resident of England.  But when leaving the cathedral's midnight mass, she literally stumbles over a body.  Soon the questions are flying.  Who killed Canon Billings?  Since the list of suspects includes most of the town, more importantly why?  Dorothy has her hands full trying to figure this one out.<br />I was drawn in by the charm of this book.  It starts out rather quickly and the pace never lags until the gripping conclusion.  Dorothy is an interesting main character.  I felt her interest in the murder was a little under explained, but I was willing to let that go.  I really enjoyed the writing style.  The first person narration felt like a letter to a friend and the scenes where Dorothy argued with her self were funny because they were so true.<br />Having already discovered this author's other series, I now look forward to reading more in this one as well.  She is a truly talented mystery author.	2003-02-26
1219586:US	52868156	RQSSNQ8TRYQV3	042518191X	156918694	You've Got Murder (A Turing Hopper Mystery)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	New Series is a Winner	When Zack doesn't show up at work for several days in a row, Turing is concerned.  She does what she can to find him, but her resources are a little limited.  While she can find any bit of information, she can't actually investigate in person because she's an Artificial Intelligence Personality, or AIP for short.  Asking the aid of human friends Maude and Tim, Turing begins to get a picture that causes her to worry more.  Zack seems to have stumbled on something huge.  But was he killed or is he hiding out?  And can Turing protect her friends, human and AIP, when the danger continues to build?<br />I've enjoyed Ms. Andrews' other series, but was a bit skeptical when it came to this book.  An AIP as the main character?  This just sounded too far fetched for me.  Yet she pulled it off with no trouble what-so-ever.  All three of the main characters come off as fully developed.  Most interesting was Turing, who reminded me of similar characters in the various Star Trek series.  She has true strengths and weaknesses and grows the most as a character because of the story.  The plot is a little slow getting off the ground, but the time is used to establish Turing and her environment.  Once the story takes off, it moves at lightning speed.  I was often turning pages to find out what would happen next.  The point of view switches from Turing to Maude and Tim, making the best dramatic use of the story.  The ending seemed a bit rushed, but only a little.<br />I'm looking forward to seeing what Ms. Andrews has up her sleeves next for Turing and her friends.  This is a fascinating world I look forward to visiting many more times to come.	2003-02-21
1228266:US	52868156	RJVXEQ1KOM4O	0448095017	605847199	The Secret of the Old Clock (Nancy Drew, Book 1)	Books	4	14	16	N	N	It all Started Here	Nancy Drew is heading home when she witnesses a little girl almost get hit by a truck.  This chance meeting with Judy and her aunts leads Nancy into her first mystery.  The aunts were counting on inheriting money from their cousin Josiah Crowley.  But other relatives have produced a will that leaves everything to them.  When Nancy begins to realize the plight of everyone left out of the will, she feels she must investigate.  But where might the real will be hidden?<br />I read many of Nancy's mysteries while growing up, but I realized I'd never read this one before.  The story seemed a little more straight forward then I remember others being, but it might just be me.  Still, Nancy tackles the case with her usual enthusiasm.  I was most surprised to discover the Bess and George weren't present for this first adventure.  Frankly, I missed them.<br />I simply must share the line that drew lots of laughs from me.  A villain is confronting Nancy and says, \\"This will be the last time you'll ever stick your nose in business that doesn't concern you!\\"  If you only knew, fella....<br />Nancy may not represent the best literature available, but she's fun escapism that everyone needs.  Over 70 years old, she's proved her staying power.  This is the perfect series to make life long mystery lovers out of kids.  Sure worked for me.	2003-02-14
1230792:US	52868156	R2C95LV3GMRT2L	0786889624	243700920	The Hearse You Came in On (Hitchcock Sewell Mysteries)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Humorous Debut Keeps You Turning Pages	Hitchcock Sewell is a little surprised when the beautiful Carolyn James walks into his mortuary in a tennis outfit and starts asking questions about arranging her own funeral.  When she changes her mind and walks out, Hitch does his best to shrug it off.  But then Carolyn James turns up dead from suicide.  Only it wasn't the woman he met two days ago.  More then a little curious, Hitch starts to investigate, uncovering more then he ever bargained for in the process.  Meanwhile, he must also survive rehearsals at the Gypsy Players, the worst amateur playhouse in history.<br />This is a fun debut mystery.  Hitch's observations and witty/sarcastic narration made the story easy to read.  The plot twists quite a few times, and I had no clue what would happen next.  The characters were likable, interesting, and well developed for a debut.  My only complaint was that the story dragged in parts.  A little meandering was ok in the beginning, but overall the story could have used some tightening.<br />Lovers of humorous mysteries will love this book.  A star is born in a new series that will entertain readers for years to come.	2003-02-12
1238551:US	52868156	R3A5ODBV2UNL48	0765304368	505704893	Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom	Books	4	35	40	N	Y	Great first novel	Julius has finally realized his life long dream of living in Disney World.  He finds his job with the Liberty Square ad hocs to be fun and his girlfriend Lil keeps him feeling young.  When his best friend Dan shows up, he feels his life is complete.  But then he's murdered.  Granted, it's only his third death, which isn't bad for being over a hundred, but he still takes it rather personally.  He's even more surprised when he finds out that Deb moved into the Hall of Presidents while he was out.<br />Deb is leading a group that is slowly bringing all the attractions into the modern era with new technology.  Julius and his friends oppose this because they want to keep the park the way it was in the 20th century, technology, storylines, and all.  Julius feels he should take a stand, but what can he do?<br />First, the bad.  Maybe it's because I don't read that much science fiction, but I had a hard time with the jargon of this book.  For the first 50 pages or so, I was really struggling to follow the new terms the characters were using when discussing their lives.<br />But once I got the lingo down, I couldn't put the book down.  The story is interesting with quite a few twists and turns.  All the characters were interesting and well developed, but I especially liked Julius.  He was easy to care about, and I had to know what would happen to him next.  I'm a huge Disney fan, so the back drop of Disney World certainly didn't hurt either.  In fact, it made me want to visit the park even more.<br />Cory Doctorow is definitely an author to watch.  He weaves a good yarn in an interesting vision of the future.  I'm already looking forward to whatever he has up his sleeve next.	2003-02-06

The last thing he needs is someone shot in a field.  Especially someone wearing a deer suit.  While investigating, he finds a buck that is acting just plain loopy.  Meanwhile, a body is found in a nearby dam.  As Deputy Bobby Garza begins to investigate this mysterious death, other strange things start to happen.  Can the two law men piece the puzzle together?<br />I was amazed at the plotting in this book.  The author is able to keep several balls in the air at the same time and bring everything together for a nice conclusion at the end.  The characters were interesting as well, and it was easy to root for the good guys.  Characterization is also where a problem lies.  The author spends a little too much time on needless character history, sometimes stopping the story to do it.  Also, while billed as a humorous story, I didn't find myself laughing.  I was certainly engaged and anxious to keep reading, however.<br />On a personal level, I didn't enjoy a few of the characters and situations.  Then again, I generally stick with \\"cozies\\" and I knew this wasn't one before I started reading.<br />Readers who enjoy a \\"caper\\" storyline will enjoy this book.  It's a well plotted first effort that will win the author many well deserved fans.  I'm glad I gave it a try, but I think I'll head back to my normal selections now.	2003-02-02

While exploring the large house, Lucy finds that the wardrobe in the spare room transports her to the magical land of Narnia.  The country is under the spell of a terrible witch who has made it always winter but never Christmas.  At first, her siblings don't believe her, but soon they, too, find themselves in this new country.  With danger around every turn, they must survive treachery to join Aslan the lion in the fight to free Narnia and break the spell.<br />I read this book for the first time in third grade, and it holds up just as well today.  The pace of the writing is a bit slow, but the adventure is sure to hook readers.  Lewis creates a wonderful fanciful world that is lots of fun to visit.  This is the first I read and still my favorite.  There's something about this book that captures the wonder of finding a new, magical world that the other books don't have.<br />Lewis also created just the right spell for his land to horrify kids and to a lesser extend adults.  The idea of always having winter and all it brings but never getting to celebrate Christmas is too awful to mention.<br />A brief word about book order.  When I read this book, it was considered the first in the series.  Now, some people have put the books in chronological order, making it the second.  While I fell that reading them in the original order is the best approach, it really doesn't matter that much.  Nothing about the other books is spoiled here since this was the first one written, but not much about this book is spoiled if you read them in the order events occur.<br />Narnia is one of several classic kids' series about mythical countries and is still my favorite.  It's perfect for anyone wanting to leave our world behind for a touch of fantasy.	2003-01-30

They're looking forward to a relaxing week in this historic city until Mr. Emmett is arrested for theft.  Seems lots of Civil War relics have been stolen from the museum where Mike's cousin works and appeared in the back of Mr. Emmett's car.  The gang is sure that Mike's uncle is being set up.  The question is, can they prove it?<br />Time with this foursome is always well spent.  As usual, I got sucked into this book and had a very hard time putting it down.  There were some very fun character scenes that had me laughing out loud.  The plot was a little straight forward and not one of Mr. Brouwer's best.  Still, it was good enough to keep me glued to the book to find out what would happen next.<br />Fans of the series will devour this book and start looking for more.  Even reluctant readers will be lured in by the short chapters and fun characters.  Recommended for kids and mystery fans of all ages.	2003-01-28

But the perfect day is brought to abrupt end when the gun signaling the end of the race explodes and kills Oliver Dixon.  While it appears to be an accident, Theo isn't convinced and begins to investigate.  Soon she has more suspects then she knows what to do with.  Was it the result of an ancient feud?  Or maybe the new, young widow wanted control of his fortune?  Or could Oliver's business investor have wanted out of his investment enough to kill?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this second mystery novel (following DEATH BY DARJEELING).  The plot is complex, with the clues pointing in every direction possible.  I still didn't know what was going on by the end, but the ending worked.  I'm not a tea person, but enjoyed the information about tea.  It was well scattered throughout and didn't bog down the storyline.  My biggest complaint is the author's tendency to switch view-point characters for a few paragraphs at random within a scene.  It makes for confusing reading but fortunately only happens a few times over the course of the novel.<br />I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Charleston and the Indigo Tea Shop.  This is a fun, relaxing series with a wonderful cast of characters and good plotting.  Put the kettle on and enjoy.	2003-01-28

This volume is the complete set of tales about Elmer and his friend the dragon, including the fun illustrations.  The complete set includes \\"My Father's Dragon,\\" \\"Elmer and the Dragon,\\" and \\"The Dragons of Blueland.\\"<br />These stories are perfect first chapter books for kids.  The vocabulary is simple and the chapters are short.  I'd forgotten just how short until I started rereading them.  Yet the stories are packed full of adventure.  Elmer is especially resourceful, and I still get a kick out of how he takes the simplest things and makes them work in whatever situation he finds himself.<br />Whether kids read these stories themselves or listen to them being read, they're sure to become favorites.  And adults will enjoy the clever story lines as well.	2003-01-24

I was curious, so I watched.  It wasn't too long before I was hooked.  I had to know what would happen next and how Sydney would get out of yet another predicament.  Anyone who knows me will tell you I've become a die hard addict, so when I found out about this book, I had to get a copy.<br />Everything you might possibly want to know about this show is included between the covers.  It starts by discussing J.J Abrams ideas that lead to the show and goes through the first season finale.  Along the way, you get a behind the scenes look at everything from location scouting to costuming, color schemes, and the sets.  Heck, I even learned some new stuff while reading.  The last section includes detailed on set reports of the filming of the season finale.<br />A highlight of the book is the detailed episode guide.  Here, the author breaks every episode down to plot threads and keeps the story straight for us.  It's wonderful if you need to catch up on some shows or just want a quick reminder of what's already happened.<br />No matter how fanatical about Alias you are, this is a wonderful book.  It will help fill in gaps or just give you a better picture of all the work that goes on behind the scenes to bring us one of the best shows currently on television.	2003-01-22

Theres a new exhibit going into the artists co-op, shes writing up the story of Japanese-Americans from the area during World War II, and shes helping put on a senior prom at San Celinas retirement home.  As the dance draws to a close, she finds two of the residences murdered.  What did they have in common that would lead to their deaths?  Meanwhile, old flame Clay OHara is back in town.  His status as lead suspect starts to come between Benni and Gabe.  Benni finds herself drawn into solving this case no matter what Gabe says.  If she stays alive long enough to do it, will this end their relationship?<br />Once again, Ms. Fowler has written a captivating story told with real emotion.  Its hard not to be drawn into this world and really care for the characters.  I found myself choking up on more then one occasion, yet also smiling and laughing at many of the lighter moments.  The plot seems to get a little sidetracked near the middle, but picks up speed and reaches an interesting and satisfying conclusion.<br />Anyone looking for a mystery with strong characters and interesting stories will love this series.  I wont be able to stop myself from picking up the next to see what these people, I mean characters, are up to next.	2003-01-21

I found myself laughing my way through this book just as much as I had the previous treasuries.  And not much has changed in the household.  Peter and Paige still try to avoid homework while Jason loves it.  Jason's still a computer geek that invents new ways to torment his sister daily.  Andy still serves food the rest of the family can't stand to eat.  I found myself laughing at the new punch lines for these and other favorite storylines.  The humor is timeless with timely topics.  I especially loved the strips on The Lord of the Rings movies.  Other fun series included Marcus and Jason playing detective to find a scrap book and the family vacation.  And I got a kick out of seeing ultimate Frisbee get a mention in one of the strips.<br />The book introduces a new format to the treasuries.  Each page now represents a complete week's strips, so it's a little smaller and easier to hold while reading.  Of course, Sunday strips are still in color.<br />Alas, there is a down side.  There is almost two years worth of strips here.  Plenty to laugh at, but that means it'll be two years before we can enjoy another treasury of this wonderful comic strip.	2003-01-18

I was just finishing up a logic class and was working on an assignment to present two sides of an argument.  I figured this book would help me greatly in my chosen topic, creation vs. evolution.  Was I ever disappointed.<br />I read chapter after chapter, impressed by the qualifications but not by the content.  Every author used the fallacies I'd been studying in class &amp; presented very little in the way of solid evidence or arguments.  Some were even laughable in their leaps of logic.<br />Even the title is fallacious if you think about it.  There are respected scientists who are creationists.<br />Creation vs. evolution is a serious subject that deserves careful evaluation.  Unfortunately, this isn't the book to do it.  Look elsewhere to find what evolutionists say to creationists' arguments.	2003-01-18

His wife is divorcing him, he's living in a run down house, and the day job he hates is keeping him from doing what he'd really love to do, music.  So, he does what any 20-something in his shoes would do, gets involved in a murder.<br />Jason only met Monica Gleason once, but he encouraged her to get on stage for the performance where she ultimately died.  Channeling all his energies into finding out what happened, it's not too long before he's making enemies.  But what has he learned that would earn him drive by shootings, smashed car windows, and attempted kidnappings?  Dragging his friends Mitch and Robert along, he's determined to find out.<br />I actually read the second book in this series (Coffin's Got the Dead Guy on the Inside) first.  Reading this book really helped me understand the relationships between the series characters that had tripped me up reading that book.  The plot moves along in several unexpected directions, and the characters are different and interesting.  Living in Southern California, I especially had fun following the locations as they went to places I know.  Jason and his friends have a very fun sense of humor, and I found myself laughing out loud at their dialog many times.  I especially enjoyed the scenes between Jason and Detective Johns.<br />I will admit to being just a little disappointed with this book, however.  This is obviously a first novel.  The writing style is a little choppy, I guessed a couple things before they happened, and some of the humor fell flat.  I didn't notice these problems in the second book, and I expected this book to live up to those standards.  But these really are minor complaints over all.<br />This book is a weird mix of suspense, humor, and dark plot that actually works.

Yeshua sends the three &quot;Sparrows,&quot; Emet, Ha-or, and Avel, off with a message for Zadok, who takes them in and begins to teach them the ways of a shepherd in Bethlehem.  Meanwhile, the political situation in Jerusalem over the use of temple money to build a Roman aqueduct heats up, trapping the shepherds as well as Marcus and Nakdimon in the cross fire.  Will the situation erupt during Passover?  Will Yeshua show up?  If so, will he be in danger?  And exactly who is he anyway?<br />This is the third break in the 1948 storyline in the series.  While I've enjoyed the look at 1st century Israel, I still want to know more about Moshe, Rachel, and the other characters we started the series with.  But that's my only complaint.<br />The books set in the 1st century are different from normal Thoene books because the focus is more on emotional struggles and the political battles take a back seat.  As always, the historical research is outstanding, transporting the reader completely to another time and place.  The Thoene's once again weave powerful word pictures from the story that clearly show what Jesus did for us.<br />While I'm sorry to leave the 1948 storyline behind, I'm anxious for their new series to start as it continues the story of Yeshua and his followers.	2003-01-02

Uses range from the fun (pillow and secret sharer) to the more useful (paper boy) with a few serious thrown in for good measure (search and rescue).

This year, she has 15 guests who will be enjoying the best Sonoma County has to offer, from wine to history and scenery.  But when the former owner of the winery they're using as home base is found dead, Lynne suddenly has her hands full.  The police find links from the dead man to her guests.  Meanwhile, Lynne is trying to keep the tour going and make sure everyone is having a good time.  Unless this murder gets solved quickly and quietly, it'll be very bad for business.<br />I enjoyed this debut novel in a new series.  Having grown up in Sonoma County, I had a very fun time watching the characters go from one landmark I've visited to another.  The characters were interesting and pulled me in.  There's a cheat sheet before the book starts that lists all the travelers in the story, and I used it frequently for the first few chapters to keep everyone straight.  But once I got into the story, I found the characters had come alive enough that I didn't need to refer to that page any more.  The only down side was the plot.  The murder often seemed to take a back seat to the sub-plots involving the characters on the tour.  Still, the story does advance consistently, and the author's choice to tell the story from multiple characters' viewpoints adds much to the overall effect.<br />Lynne Montgomery is a great new character in a potentially great series.  A little tightening of the plot will make this series rise above other cozies.  Either way, I'm already planning to book passage on the next trip in this series.	2002-12-31

Kenny Mancuso had shot his friend, not fatally, and then skipped out on his bond.  Should be real simple, right?  Of course, first she has to find Kenny.  Then his friend is murdered.  Trying to track down any leads, she joins Grandma Mazur at a funeral home run by Spiro, another of Kenny's childhood friends.  But Spiro has a case of his own.  24 caskets have been stolen, and he wants Stephanie to hunt them down.  Is there a connection?  With Ranger to advise and Joe Morelli to shadow, will Stephanie put all the pieces in place and catch Kenny before he turns on her?<br />Stephanie Plum is an appealing heroine.  She acts tough, but in reality she's all too human.  The plot is complicated enough to keep the reader engaged, and the action never lets up.  There were several parts I thought I had figured out only to learn later I was wrong.  And Grandma Mazur is a riot as she gets more involved in the story.<br />It's easy to see why these books are so popular - an appealing main character and fun stories.  If you're looking for purely escapist fiction, this is the series for you.	2002-12-22

Fortunately, help arrives in the form of a Pony Express rider who risks his job to help the strangers.  Unfortunately, he unknowingly was followed by two outlaws desperate to get their hands on the mail he carries.<br />Sigmund Brouwer weaves another wonderful tale in this novella.  It's a heart warming story of love shown to others at Christmas that's short enough to read in one sitting.  Start a fire, pour your favorite Christmas beverage, and enjoy this tale from frontier America.	2002-12-19

She and her two best friends, Tommy Red Hawk and Meagen Paige, are staying in a cabin in Spearfish Canyon as guests of Meagen's dad.  But on the first day, Rinnah is handed a note from a nervous, mysterious woman who says &quot;They're after the rose,&quot; before taking off again.  Then the woman is found face down in a pond.  The note is confusing, but the trio is determined to discover what it means.  With every clue they piece together, they discover they're in more danger.  Meanwhile, Meagen is having a hard time adjusting to the new woman in her dad's life.  This summer is shaping up to be anything but restful.<br />This is the second in a new mystery series for kids.  I'd enjoyed the first, and this one didn't disappoint me in the least.  The characters are real kids with strengths and weaknesses.  The plot left me confused until the end.  Mr. Johnson skillfully weaves sub-plots into the story and  pulls off several tense, atmospheric scenes.  I was turning the pages quickly for the last 50, trying to find out what would happen next.<br />Kids ready to move on from the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew will love this new series featuring great characters, plot, and writing.  My only complaint?  The third one isn't out yet!	2002-12-18

It focuses on his early military career fighting with the British against the French and Indians, working his plantation, and responding when his new country needed a general and first President.<br />Unfortunately, this book aimed at kids could have been better.  The narrative is uneven, making it hard to follow how much time has passed between stories we're reading.  Furthermore, the style is choppy with too many simple sentences strung together.  On the other hand, there are some thrilling stories from his days fighting in armies that will keep young readers interested.  And his writing is used creatively to show his belief in God without interrupting the flow.<br />George Washington was a great man we can all learn from.  This biography gives some interesting information and a good overview of his life and times.  Unfortunately, it's not quite polished enough to get a full recommendation.	2002-12-13

After much persuasion, she starts to assist Paddy Riley with his PI business.  But she hasn't been there too long before she walks into the office one day to find her new boss dead.  Why was he murdered?  Molly's determined to find out.  Meanwhile, her relationship with Daniel hits a major snag.  And her living situation gets very sticky when Seamus's relatives keep showing up.<br />I enjoyed the second in this historical fiction series.  The author has done her research, and it shows.  The detail is fantastic, and I was drawn into the world of 100 years ago.  The plot moves better here then in the first in the series, and the subplots add the right mixture to the overall storyline.  Molly's really grown on me, too.  She's the right mix of stubbornness and the naivet&eacute; that would come from her previous life in a small Irish village.  The historical aspect of this is done right as well, mixing real life people into the fictitious story.<br />I've recently been rediscovering my love of historical fiction, and this book is a perfect fit in that genre.  Ms. Bowen seamlessly mixes history and mystery into an engrossing story.	2002-12-11

She insists that the cold won't slow her down.  What does stop her in her tracks is the sudden appearance of her ex-stepson, Jeff.  Sullen and refusing to discuss why he's there, Aunt Nettie offers him a temporary job at TenHuis Chocolade.<br />Meanwhile, the town is getting ready for a teddy bear promotion to try to attract winter visitors.  Lee and Nettie have borrowed some antique chocolate molds to decorate the shop.  But then the shop is broken into late at night and a murder takes place.  Are the two related?  Why did Jeff sneak out of the house both nights?  And, most importantly, can Lee clear him of murder?<br />The second in this cozy series will delight fans of the first.  The author does a great job of reminding us of the characters and building on their personalities.  It helps to read them in order, but with the backgrounds offered, not completely necessary.  The mystery had several facets that kept me confused, but overall it could have been a little more complex.<br />Anyone who enjoys light mysteries will enjoy this series as well.  But a word of warning.  The descriptions of the chocolate might send you to your local candy store for a quick fix.	2002-12-06

Slowly, the kids begin to uncover some things that just aren't right.  But will Whit, Jason, Connie, Tom, and the others figure things out in time?<br />Every one of these 12 episodes contributes to the Novacom story is some form or other.  The writers have done a good job of building this story.  But, if you think you know where this story is going, don't bet on it.  There are several surprises in the story line here and everything ties together perfectly for the ending.  I was glued to my seat waiting to reach that climax, too.  They also do a good job here of tying in elements from their many years on the air.  I loved some of the references to episodes from their first couple of seasons.<br />Fans waiting to see how the Novacom storyline resolves itself will be thrilled with the outcome.  If you've missed the last couple of collections, you'll want to go back and hear them before you listen to this one so everything makes sense.	2002-12-05

But moments before the earth is destroyed, he is rescued by his friend, Ford Perfect, an alien who's been living on earth.  Together, they start a wild adventure that will introduce them to Zaphod and his girlfriend Trillian.  Not to mention a depressed robot.<br />I've been hearing about this book since high school.  Many of my friends have recommended it to me, but I've never gotten around to reading it.  Believe me, that was a huge mistake.  I was frequently laughing out loud at the book.  The characters, the situations, and the narration - all of it was perfectly comical.  I'm sure I averaged a laugh a page, leading to some strange looks from my roommate as I was reading.<br />If you're looking for a fun, improbable book you won't be able to put down, look no further.  I'm already planning to pick up the rest of the increasingly inaccurately named trilogy.	2002-11-27

On this particular day, Skye arrives to find her grandma dead in her bed.  Skye's suspicions kick in since Grandma had just been given a very clean bill of health.  When the autopsy comes back showing poison, the finger of suspicion points to her own family.  Can Skye find the killer without alienating her family while dealing with the last several days of school?<br />I was highly disappointed in this book.  Stereotyping and caricature pass for character development in all but the major series characters.  Even here, the characters aren't especially likable.  Skye herself comes across as if she still has the \\"Better then you\\" attitude she left with in high school.  While the plot is better in this book then the first in the series, I had the killer, motive, and location of the final clue figured out by the half way point.<br />There are much better mystery series out there.  Save your time and money and look elsewhere for entertainment.  You'll be glad you did.	2002-11-22

Meanwhile, his relationship with Bronwen hits a snag in the form of Betsy, the barmaid.  And the Davises and Powell-Joneses are competing against each other in the festival.  Can Evan keep peace in this town and find the killer?<br />Fans of this series will love the third volume.  The author has not strayed at all from the format of the previous two books, which is good because it works so well.  The plotting, while a bit slow at first, is top notch.  I was caught off guard by the ending.  The sub-plots add just the right amount of charm and humor, while the characters continue to entertain.  I'm really growing to care for this village.<br />Cozy fans need look no further for a great series that combines likable main characters with great plotting.  If you haven't tried this series yet, pick up the first, Evans Above.  You'll be glad you did.	2002-11-20

Every letter includes several appropriate items.  They can range from the ordinary, left leg for \\"L\\", to the humorous.

They'll be laughing at some of the sentences and enjoying the meter used throughout.<br />This book bills itself as an \\"I Can Read\\" book.  I hesitate slightly only because Dr. Seuss does throw a few of his trademark unusual characters into the mix.  A parent will need to be close by to help their child sound out the harder words.<br />Dr. Seuss was a master at making picture books fun for all ages.  This is a classic example parents will enjoy reading time and time again, even if their kids ask for it every night.	2002-11-16

Now the Dragon must find Elmer in time to help his family without being spotted by other humans.  But what if Elmer can't come up with a plan?<br />This is the final in the My Father's Dragon series.  It lives up to the second book, but both fall a little short of the creativity and humor of the first.  Still, fans will want to know how the series ends and won't be disappointed with the story presented here.  As with the others, the storyline and vocabulary are perfect for the beginning reader or as a read aloud story.<br />This series is a great way to introduce kids to the joys of reading.

A Southerner opposed to slavery, he tries to stay as neutral as possible, even with his new job in the Secret Service.  But trouble seems to find him.  Someone's shooting at him on the street.  Then he's assigned to guard Colonel Edward Baker, one of President Lincoln's best friends.  This is a nearly impossible task in the midst of battle, but when the Colonel is killed in cold blood, Harry finds himself accused of the crime.  Escaping from jail, he must stay one step ahead of his former co-workers to clear his name.<br />This novel, like its predecessor, provides a fascinating look at life during the Civil War.  Real people are liberally sprinkled throughout, and I greatly enjoyed meeting their fictitious personas.  I especially like the way Lincoln is portrayed in his few appearances.  The fictitious characters are interesting as well.  The plot itself seems to loose its way at times, but all the pieces to come together for a climax that includes some interesting twists.<br />With the characters being agents and counter-agents, the book takes on the feel of a spy novel at times.  Yet, the plot includes enough interesting twists to make it a good mystery as well.  Anyone interested in this time period will greatly enjoy this series.	2002-11-11

His list of enemies includes most of the island, but Meg's dad is the chief suspect.  Now, Meg is searching the rain soaked island for clues, hoping she can clear her dad before the real killer leaves when the ferry resumes after the storm.<br />While I enjoyed the first book in this series, I loved this one.  The plot is more focused here.  It starts out slowly, but once the body is found, things quickly get moving.  There are several great plot twists, and the story reaches a satisfying conclusion.  Yet, the book is still filled with the humor that made the first fun to read.  And the characters are alive and interesting as well.<br />Anyone looking for a fun, light-hearted mystery need look no further then this series.  I'm already planning my next visit with Meg and her family and hope to enjoy many more to come.	2002-11-08

Tired of constantly defending her Christian faith, she's spending her summer in Israel on an archaeological dig.  While over there, she meets Ari Kazan, a physicist convinced he's found the secret to time travel, or time like, self-intersecting loops.  But when Ari's partner, Damien West, uses the devise to travel back to the first century, Rivka and Ari find themselves caught in a plot to assassinate the Apostle Paul and changed the world as we know it.  Can they overcome their differences and the different culture to stop his plan?<br />This book started out strong.  The characters were interesting and the plot intriguing.  I especially enjoyed a look at first century life from a modern perspective, a bit of a twist on the usual historical novel.  However, about two-thirds of the way through, things fell apart.  The plot, which had been developing nicely, suddenly became haphazard, with characters doing things for no apparent reason.  After an intense climax, several important themes and sub-plots were glossed over, leaving little feeling of resolution.<br />It's a shame that this book did not finish the way it started.  It gets high marks for originality, but the lack of follow-through keeps me from giving it a good recommendation.	2002-10-29

Reserved and a book worm, she hopes to find independence in the academic setting.  But making friends and finding a good job isn't all it's cracked up to be.  She's getting discouraged when her life changes forever.<br />One day, a stranger offers her a job as an agent for SD-6, a covert branch of the CIA.  Once her training begins, a new world opens up to her.  But is she really capable of fitting in to this new world?<br />As a diehard fan of the TV show, I had to read this book.  I was very impressed by it.  Even though fans already know the basics of what is presented here, the author still manages to make it interesting.  I had a hard time putting it down, dying to know what happened next.  Furthermore, the author maintains continuity with the show for even small details, which is great fun for fans.  The characters read like they sound on TV, and I was also impressed by the author's use of the cast of characters.  Not all the characters from the show appear in this book or play major roles, which perfectly fits the show's timeline.<br />My only complaint is that the first chapter spends a bit too long giving us the background on Syd we know from the show without developing this novel's plot.  Overall, it's a fast, entertaining read that will please fans of the series.  I'm looking forward to future prequel novels.	2002-10-29

She arrives in time for the annual Chokeberry Days festival, and finds the dead body of the celebrity who had come to make a special appearance.  But, the victim is not the sweet television host she appeared to be, and her secret past make Skye's brother the chief suspect.  Can Skye cut through the resentment she left behind to find the real killer?<br />I went into this book with high hopes based on the word of mouth the book was getting.  However, I was mildly disappointed when I read it.  Many of the supporting characters, including suspects, are little more the caricatures.  The story is not a plot but little more then a series of events with a conclusion.  Still, I was intrigued enough by the main characters to book a return trip to Scumble River.<br />This book, from a first time author, does show some promise.  Hopefully, the author will improve as the series progresses.	2002-10-22

Once on board, she encounters a rude man and has a very public fight with him.  When that man is murdered on Ellis Island, Molly finds herself and a new friend among the chief suspects.  Frightened she might be sent back to face the hangman, she decides to find the real killer on her own.  But can this new arrival find the killer in New York City when she doesn't know her way around and doesn't know anyone?<br />Molly is a head strong character who leaps first and considers the consequences later.  It was fun watching her try to get herself out of several sticky situations.  The setting, 1901 New York City, is brought to life, and I enjoyed learning a bit more about the time and place.  My only real complaint is that the book took a while to get started.  The plot starts slowly, but it picks up speed as it goes along.<br />As a fan of this author's Constable Evans books, I'm looking forward to reading more about Molly as well.  There is potential here for another great series with another interesting setting.  Write on, Ms. Bowen!	2002-10-10

Attitudes in the town haven't changed, and Anne is one of the few people willing to talk to Tigger.  When he confides that he's received a death threat, Anne thinks little of it.

But the truth will take her into secrets she never suspected her neighbors were hiding.  Can she sort through them all and learn the truth?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this series debut.  The resort town setting is fun and the characters are intriguing.  I especially liked the two leads, and it was easy to feel sympathetic for them.  What stood out most to me was the plot, however.  The surprises never let up and keep you guessing.  I was glued to the book, trying to figure out how everything fit together.<br />I will definitely be booking more time with Anne in Oceanside Heights.  This series is a great way to spend a few hours relaxing at the beach, or anywhere else for that matter.	2002-10-09

A Virginia native, he's loyal to his state and family.  But he also opposes slavery.  Living in Washington doesn't make finding his desired neutrality any easier to find.<br />When a friend insists on going to watch the first, and certainly the only, battle in the Civil War, Harry reluctantly accompanies her.  Instead of a quick victory, they are shocked when the Union soldiers flee right past them.  The next morning, the retreat is being blamed on one Major shot down during the last moments of the battle.  But Harry is convinced that the man was really murdered.  He's hired by the man's family to learn the truth and redeem his name.  With his carefully guarded neutrality on the line, Harry sets out to find the truth, wherever that may lead, including a smuggling plot that the victim may have been involved with.<br />I was very impressed with this mystery debut.  The story is obviously well researched; I was completely transported back to 1861 while reading it.  The plot moves forward at a leisurely pace, but throws some great twists in as the story progresses.  Still, it is possible to follow exact what happens if you're paying attention.  The characters were interesting and realistic, and the use of real people added just the right amount of fun to the proceedings without being too far fetched.<br />As a fan of US history, I'm looking forward to more books in this series that is part mystery and part political intrigue.  The mix looks to be just right for many more entertaining books.	2002-09-27

All Jason Keltner wants to do is get out of Pasadena by himself and work on composing some music, especially Untitled #23.  But, with rent overdue, he agrees to watch his ex-friend Paul Reno to see what he's up to.  After all, the money's not bad.<br />Paul is up to no good, as always.  When Jason and Paul go to a party, their host falls down dead.  Soon, goons are chasing the two of them; which isn't a good thing, considering Jason's beat up, almost classic car.  Paul is obviously hiding something, and Jason just doesn't know who to trust.  So, he enlists the help of his friends Robert and Martin.  But are they in over their heads?  And, if so, can they stay one step ahead of everyone who's after them?<br />First, the bad.  This book just jumps in and never fully explains the relationships between some of the characters.  I was confused for the first 30 pages or so as to who was who and why some characters were treating each other the way they were.  Part of that is probably because this is the second in the series, but a little more background would have been nice.<br />However, once I got beyond those first 30 pages, I fell under the book's unique spell.  The book was written exactly for my sarcastic, punny sense of humor, and I found myself laughing out loud at the banter between Jason, Mitch, and Robert.  And the chicken wing/celery/ranch dressing debate is not to be missed.  The plot starts a little slowly, but quickly picks up speed as the story progresses.  While sometimes the characters seem to come too quickly, if you work at it, you can keep track of everyone and whose side they're really on.<br />This book requires a little extra concentration then many I normally read to keep everything straight, but it's completely worth it.  Keith Snyder has earned himself a new fan, and I can't wait to catch up on Jason, Robert, and Mitch's other adventures.	2002-09-13

Qwill is looking for some relaxation, so he takes Koko and Yum Yum up to his cabin by the lake.  But far from relaxing, he finds himself doing more then his normal columns for the paper.  He's got a new restaurant and play to review.  The locals have become obsessed with UFO sightings.  And a hiker has disappeared.  Looks like he and Koko have their work cut out for them.<br />Or they might if this were an ordinary book in the series.  It really does seem like the author is running out of steam with the series.  While it's never been the height of suspense, usually the cases progress with some regularity over the course of the book.  Here, however, we are treated to many meetings with friends we've made over the series, but, while enjoyable, they don't serve to advance the storyline.  Several things are introduced and never resolved, and the \\"climax\\" is extremely weak.  Not to mention a final chapter that is pulled from a lesser novel.<br />Even die hard fans will find it hard to enjoy this entry in the long running series.  By all means, if you're new to Lilian Jackson Braun, do NOT start here.  The earlier books in the series are much better and show why she has developed such a loyal following.  This was my first time to try one of the later books, and I hope it's not indicative of its neighbors.  I'd hate to see such a fun series go out with a whimper instead of a bang.	2002-09-12

After her daughter Ruby was born, she decided to put her career as a public defender on hold because she wasn't giving enough to either her career or her family.  Yet she's restless spending all her time at home with her two year old daughter.<br />Trying to get Ruby into the best nursery school in Los Angeles doesn't go well.  But that night the founder, Abigail Hathaway, is run down by a car.  Juliet is positive she knows who the killer is.  But when she starts investigating, she finds that it might not be as simple a case as she thought.  Does she still remember enough of her training to successfully build a case against the killer?<br />I enjoyed this debut novel.  Juliet is a likable heroine who struggles with her desire to do what's best for her daughter and soon to be born son and the desire to continue a job she loves.  Occasionally, she borders on whining, but she also knows she's made the right choice for now.  The plotting was good, although I felt Juliet was a little dumber then need be at the end.  Still, I only saw the ending coming a few pages before she did.<br />I'm definitely going to continue to check in on this family and see where they go from here.  Ayelet Waldman has the potential for a great series with these characters.	2002-09-12

Rather then expose his family to his disease; he secludes himself from the world.  But when he finds a baby girl, how will her unconditional love change his out look on his life?<br />This novella is a quick read.  I got through it in a couple hours one evening.  But that doesn't make it any less powerful.  Sigmund Brouwer has created a cast of characters that need the love of God, and works them through their problems.  The ending had me in tears.<br />Anyone looking for a good story that will move you while making you rethink your own priorities need look no further.  This powerful little book is must reading.	2002-09-09

Much to her dismay, she finds that her father was right this time.  Her Aunt Nancy's body is lying face down in the water.  But who could have wanted to kill her aunt?  Or was Peaches the intended victim, since she and the victim have similar dresses.  Then another murder takes place, in a trap most likely meant for Peaches.  What does it all mean?  Peaches will have to use every memory trick she's learned over the years to figure this one out.<br />With a title like this book has, I went in expecting a cozy mystery and was not disappointed in that regard.  The book could have been better overall, however.  The plot moves along at a slow pace and I really struggled to get into it.  While there are several likeable characters, I also found myself irritated by many of them.  The references to Peaches' poor memory (which I didn't think was nearly as bad as it was made out to be) and excerpts from her \\"book\\" on memory techniques were also overdone.<br />Peaches is certainly a pleasant character.  I'll probably give the author another try to see if she developed as a mystery writer.  Not my favorite book read this year, but I've certainly read worse.	2002-09-05

The country is reeling from the news that President McKinley has been shot.  But of even more concern to maid Hilda Johansson is the fact that the assassin had passed through South Bend, Indiana within the last few weeks.  Had he met with any of her friends?  But when two bodies are found, one covered with an American flag, things really heat up in town.  Is this the work of anarchists out to destroy America?  Or are immigrants being unfairly blamed?  Add to that the secret the workers at the Studebaker plant are hiding, and Hilda has her hands full.<br />This book is a fascinating mixture of fact and fiction.  I was drawn into the time and place completely while reading.  I enjoyed the Hilda character, an independent woman struggling to live in her time and social place.  The story itself was very good.  With several different things going on at once, it was hard to know for sure what was happening and who to believe.  And, while I did guess the solution, I completely overlooked the clues that pointed to the ending.  My only complaint is that the author's note really belongs at the back of the book.<br />This was my introduction to the Hilda Johansson character.  I'm hooked on this fun mix of fact and mystery and will be looking for the others in the series.	2002-09-04

With her savings gone and her car repossessed, she's desperate enough to ask her cousin Vinnie for a job.  But the filing job she went in for has been filled, so she decides to try her hand at bounty hunting.  After all, how hard can it be?<br />Turns out to be plenty hard.  After all, most of the criminals won't come when asked politely.  And she did target Joe Morelli, a cop on the run trying to prove he was framed.  Still, that huge paycheck and a shared past keep her focused on Morelli.  But when boxer Benito Ramirez starts dogging her trail, she begins to suspect she's in over her head.  Can she survive long enough to bring Morelli in?<br />I've been hearing lots about these books, but hadn't had a chance to try one yet.  Wish I hadn't waited so long.  The writing style is engaging and the pace fast.  I had a hard time putting the book down and couldn't stop thinking about it when I did.  When the book ended, I started looking around for the second to see what would happen next to the main characters.<br />It's easy to see why this series is so popular.  The fun characters and storyline make for quick, light reading.  I'm looking forward to catching up on the seven books I haven't read yet and hope to enjoy visits with these characters for many years to come.	2002-08-23

But when one of her top authors, Blanche DuBois is poisoned, she is surprised.  Meredith Lawrence, a teenager, has recently wormed her way into Claire's life.  Meredith is determined to solve the mystery.  But can they do it before the killer strikes again?<br />I was greatly disappointed with this book.  I found Meredith to be annoying, and, while the character softened by the end of the book, it wasn't enough to redeem her.  The plotting is uneven at best.  There are long passages where we really learn nothing new about the case but just develop the characters.  While I love a book with strong characters, character development should never be at the expense of plot.  Furthermore, the ending left me with a few questions, not a good thing for a mystery.<br />Fortunately, I have not bought any of the other books in this series.  I won't be looking for further adventures because there are better books out there to read.	2002-08-23

In between promo material for commercial companies, she gets a request to write a love letter.  Geeky Howard Murdoch has a crush on Stacy, one of the instructors at his fitness center.  Jaine figures Stacy will never agree to the date and is shocked to learn that her letter actual was successful.  But the biggest shock is when Howard arrives for their date to discover Stacy bludgeoned to death with her thigh master.  The police are sure Howard did it, and Jaine feels responsible for getting him in this mess.  So she starts digging into the case herself.  She finds no shortage of suspects, but can she figure out what's happening before something happens to her?<br />This series debut was an absolute delight.  The story is well plotted, and the pace never lets up.  The main characters are fleshed out well.  What sets this book apart, however, is the humor.  Written in the first person, the pages drip with wit and sarcasm in all the right places.  I constantly had a grin on my face, and several times found myself laughing out loud.  Yet, it never looses sight of the fact that it's a murder mystery first; the humor never gets in the way of the story.<br />Anyone looking for a light, fun mystery for a relaxing weekend or trip need look no further.  I've already added this series to my favorites and look forward to Jaine's further adventures.	2002-08-15

Colonel Arbuthnot is hit over the head and killed right after discovering an ancient ruin on the nearby mountains.  Meanwhile, tensions build in the town when Evans-the-Meat announces a plan to put the village on the map and returning resident Ted Morgan announces plans to turn the old slate mine into an amusement park.  Then a second body turns up.  Constable Evan Evans finds himself overwhelmed with events and trying to find the pieces to make sense of it all.  But if that's not complication enough, there's a new female resident in town, and she also has her eye on the eligible lawman.<br />I just discovered this series last month, and I've already read two of them.  The characters and setting are charming.  The author's obvious love of them comes through on every page.  The plot is great as well.  While I had some things figured out, there were still enough twists to keep me surprised until the end.<br />Anyone looking for a relaxing cozy mystery would do well to book some time in Llanfair.  I'm hooked and look forward to many happy visits with Evan and his neighbors.	2002-08-07

Instead of quality time with her in-laws getting ready for sister-in-law Marisa's wedding, the bride-to-be in kidnapped on Tracy's first full day there.  Then, the by-the-book Eatons decide to give in to the strange demands and not call the police.  Tracy decides that it's up to her to find Marisa and rescue Marisa's restaurant, which her family is supposed to sell to get her back alive.  But what are the Eatons hiding?  Everyone has a secret, even the groom.  Tracy's going to have to work fast to put all the pieces together before the wedding is ruined.<br />Tracy Eaton explodes on the mystery scene with a bang in this fun book.  The plot never looses its way or the pace, and the ending truly surprised me.  I recently reread this book, and I discovered how well plotted it truly was.  Scenes that didn't mean anything to me before suddenly took on a whole different meaning when I knew the ending.  The characters are very well developed, and the plot flows from character, not the other way around.<br />Kris Neri has a true winner on her hands with the characters in this fun series.  I'm looking forward to reading about Tracy's exploits for years to come.	2002-08-05

Ellen Lang just wants her son Perry back from her husband.  The biggest problem is going to be working with Ellen, who seems helpless and doesn't want to get her husband into any trouble.  But first, her home is broken into and searched.  Then her husband is found.  Dead.  Who killed him and why?  And where is Perry?  Elvis is going to have to work fast if he's going to rescue the boy.<br />This book is a definite departure from the cozies I normally read.  Still, I couldn't put it down.  The plot moved quickly, and the tension built steadily until the end.  The characters were well developed.  I loved Elvis and his partner Joe, both tough on the outside but with big hearts just under the surface.  And the wisecracks kept me chuckling through most of the book.<br />While I'm not ready to jump ship to PI novels exclusively, this was certainly a pleasant departure.  I'll be checking in on Cole and Pike's further adventures.	2002-07-30

The only things that occupy his time are avoiding attempts to set him up with eligible women like Betsy the barmaid and answering the occasional call from Mrs. Powell-Jones about trespassers in her garden.<br />But one day, two bodies are found on nearby Mount Snowden.  Both look like hiking accidents, but Evan is convinced that something strange is going on.  Poking around, he finds a connection between the two men.  But why were they lured to their death?  Is there really a mad man on the loose on his beloved mountains?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The setting and characters were charming, and the subtle humor kept me smiling throughout.  Part way through, I was convinced I knew what was going on, but wound up being completely surprised by the ending.  The plot never looses its pace either.  There was always some new bit of information to keep me glued to the book.<br />I'm glad I gave this series a try and am already planning a return visit.  If you enjoy cozies, pick up the first in this fun series.	2002-07-17

Carpathia has just dropped two bombs on Petra, where a million believers, including Rayford, have gone to take refuge during the second half of the tribulation.  Chloe, Hannah, and Mac have just arrived in Greece to rescue George from the GC forces.  But things don't go smoothly.  The GC has begun to figure things out, and no one is safe anymore.  Can the Trib Force continue to witness and help their brothers and sisters while remaining safe?<br />This book starts with a bang, literally.  The suspense is tight for the first half, as characters are constantly in danger.  But then the pace lags.  The second half isn't nearly as well plotted or exciting as the first.  I was disappointed by the lack of development that happened here.  Still, fans will want to keep reading to find out what happens next to their favorite characters.  I know I did.<br />The problems of poor writing and cardboardish characters continue to plague this book.  Still, it's diverting and fans of the series will find it worth their time.  Non-fans of the series will want to steer clear of the book since there's nothing here to change their minds	2002-07-11

Worse, he's crushed part of the collection, and now must figure out a way to repay the debt.  Trying to work off his debt brings him in contact with Mrs. McEwan's nephew.  Ricky's sure he's not all he claims to be, but no one seems to believe him or even care.  Is Ricky right?  If so, can Ricky prove it before it's too late?  And what are his friends up to?<br />This is a reedit and reprint of a book from the original series.  Rachel, Ricky's new baby sister, has been added.  Several scenes that were humorous character scenes have also been cut.  I didn't miss them until I looked back at my first copy, but it's still a shame they've been cut out.  One of these cut scenes is referenced later in the book, so hopefully they'll do better editing jobs in the future.<br />The story itself is still intact and great fun.  Rereading it, I was once again drawn into the mystery, even though I remembered the ending.  The characters are great fun, and there were still lots of humorous parts.<br />Anyone looking for a great mystery with well-developed characters and great humor should definitely check this series out.  It's a series that everyone will enjoy reading.	2002-07-07

But then Mike discovers a Japanese statue that was hidden on their host's boat.  What was Norbert doing with it?  And who is trying to steal it?  But when Norbert disappears, the friends find they have more questions then answers.  Can they piece together the clues they do have in time to save the wedding?<br />I've been a fan of this series since it's initial release, and it's wonderful to have a new story staring the Accidental Detectives.  I was a little startled by the additional of Rachel, Ricky's one-year-old sister.  But once I got used to this new character, I felt back in the groove of the stories.<br />As is always the case with this series, the plot is truly mystifying.  The characters are well established in Mr. Brouwer's mind, and it shows in how well developed they are in this book.  The only one who wasn't quite up to par was Joel, but that's probably because he had a small part in the story.<br />Once again, this group of friends is playing jokes on each other and solving life-threatening cases.  This is one of my favorite series, and it's great to see it back in print.	2002-07-06

But when it is stolen and then found in a garbage can, she begins to smell something fishy.  And when the rightful owner of the set turns up dead, Madeline knows she must figure out what all this means.<br />I was looking for a light, fun mystery, and this story didn't disappoint.  At the same time, this book does have its more thoughtful moments, something I've come to enjoy about the series.  As always, the characters are great and provide some truly funny scenes.  The plot slows down a little in the second quarter of the book but picks up speed for the second half and doesn't slow down until you reach the climax.<br />This series is high on my favorites list, and this is a wonderful addition to the series.  If you've been missing out on these great books, start with the first, Sympathy for the Devil.  You'll be glad you did.	2002-07-04

Out of the blue, his perfect world is slowly stripped away.  While he goes about plotting his revenge, his mother-in-law Helen starts praying for his soul.  But will her prayers be enough to reach Heaven?<br />This book starts out very strong with some great writing, and I was quickly drawn into the story.  However, part way through, it lost its way.  After page 150, I had the basic plot figured out.  Any surprises I figured out pages before they happened.  And the climax was incredibly weak; it left me shaking my head instead of emotionally drawn in like I should have been.<br />This book rates two stars because of it's great beginning.  It's unfortunate that the rest of the book couldn't live up to the promise contained in those first pages.	2002-06-26

But when a storm blows them off course, they find themselves on an island with canaries that are dieing of curiosity.  Can they help the birds and still get Elmer home in time for his father's birthday?<br />This book is a fun sequel to the original.  It doesn't quite hold up to the nonsensical fun of the first one, but is still a great read.  Early readers will enjoy being able to get through the short chapters themselves and should enjoy the plot and characters.<br />This series is the perfect series to use to introduce kids to reading.  They'll be able to handle the story and characters well and enjoy the journey to another world.  Pick them up today and start them on the road to exploring other worlds through books.	2002-06-19

Prime Minister Durla has gone power mad, and with that has come paranoia.  Londo still does what he can to fight the Drakh, but with the Keeper in place, there is little he can do.  Vir, meanwhile, slowly builds an army of revolutionaries.  But can they gain strength in time to avoid an all out war with the alliance?  All bets are off when David Sheridan is implanted with his own keeper and heads to Centauri Prime.<br />This is the book that Babylon 5 fans have been waiting for.  It finally fills in the gaps left between season 5 and &quot;War Without End&quot; from the third season.  As with the series itself, even though we know the final outcome, getting there is half the journey.  The pace never lags, and there are several surprises along the way.  Once again, Mr. David has captured the characters and series perfectly.  The scenes between Londo and G'Kar are some of the best anywhere, and Londo's struggle to redeem himself has never been more touching.<br />This book is an absolute must for Babylon 5 fans.  You will love every minute of the story and leave satisfied.  Non-fans will also enjoy the story and characters, but won't have the same connection.  Either way, this is a wonderful book to end a highly recommended trilogy	2002-06-06

Novacom, the new company in town, seems to want to fit in and make its new neighbors happy.  Mitch, their new P.R. man, certainly strikes Connie's fancy.  And Whit has a great opportunity to reach out to Connellsville when he's offered a chance to open a second Whit's End there.  But there's plenty of time for fun, too, as Alex must try to get some cookies past Rodney to his grandmother.  And there's the mystery of the broken window.  Plus Edwin Blackgaard has to deal with daily life without Shakespeare when the assistant breaks a leg.<br />This collection feels like a return to the fun of the old stories.  I love having some kind of ongoing story that advances a little at a time, but I also enjoy the stand-alone stories.  This collection has a good mix of both.  It's also nice to see the same kids in enough stories to watch them develop.  I'm really starting to like the current crop.<br />Having listened to Adventures in Odyssey since it started, I'm glad to see a return to the kind of story telling that hooked me as a kid.  Hopefully, they can keep this going for years to come.	2002-05-29

And it's definitely gaining momentum.  Connie and Mitch are having problems in their relationship because Mitch works for Novacom and seems to have several secrets.  Whit's End Connellsville opens, but runs into some problems from an unexpected source.  Mandy and Sarah unexpectedly run into an old friend who provides a clue to current happenings.  Meanwhile, Aubrey must deal with a group of happy guests at the Timothy Center.  And we get to see Jason in action at one of his missions in South America.<br />This collection contains some gripping stories.  Things have gotten interesting with Novacom, and I can't wait to see how it ends.  When Dr. Blackgaard's story line ended, the show seemed to loose a little momentum, and it's nice to see that it's come back.  The non-arch episodes are also top-notch.  The last four episodes contain some surprises and will leave you waiting anxiously for the next collection.<br />Once again, the Adventures in Odyssey staff have done a top-notch job with these twelve episodes.  Don't hesitate to buy this collection and find out what's going on in this wonderful fictitious town.	2002-05-29

But why was he left in the doghouse?  Where's his older brother?  And why are his parents receiving ransom notes?  It will take all of Trixie and Honey's skills to solve this case before something truly awful happens.<br />This book stands above its neighbors in this series.  The entire gang gets good \\"page\\" time here.  Trixie and Honey find clues and put them together logically to reach the conclusions they reach.  But, to me, the best part is the development of Sergeant Molinson as a person.  We get to see the compassionate side of him that we don't usually get to see.<br />If you've never tried the Trixie Belden series before, this is a good place to start.  And if you're already a fan, you'll love this book.  Pick up a copy today.	2002-05-29

But before they know it, a woman blows in on the East Wind.  Literally.  She takes the position of caring for the four children, Jane, Michael, and the twins John and Barbara.  But with her extremely prim and proper attitude comes magical adventures.  A day in the park, having tea, running errands, and even Christmas shopping can turn into an adventure when Mary's around.  And the kids love it.<br />This most decidedly is not the Disney Mary Poppins.  Disney toned her down significantly for his movie, making her heart easier to see.  Still, it's there if you look closely in the book.  I had forgotten just how hard it is to see at times behind Mary's outward appearance and actions.  Still, the kids come to love her because they know where they really stand.<br />As with all books in the series, this one is a series of adventures.  Each chapter tells it's own story, each story it's own fun, magical adventure.<br />Those looking for Disney's Mary will be greatly disappointed.  But anyone looking for a fun series of adventures will find a woman who does care for those around her, even if it's not always super obvious.	2002-05-17

But his job gets harder when one of his guests is murdered at the top of the lighthouse and his maid quits.  Hiring Elise on the spot, he focuses on finding out who killed Reg, who was also a good friend.  But when further accidents start happening, Alex begins to wonder if he can keep the inn afloat.  Is it even worth it to try?  Who is behind everything?  And what about his relationship with Elise?<br />This book marks the debut of the Lighthouse Inn series.  Alex and Elise are great sympathetic characters and I'm looking forward to seeing them again in further books.  I also enjoyed meeting the locals and hope to see them again.  The plot started out a little slowly but picked up speed as it went and finished with a bang.  Probably the biggest problem was the setting.  It, too, wasn't nearly as developed as it could have been until later in the book.  But these flaws weren't big enough to detract from my overall enjoyment of the book.<br />Tim Myers has started what promises to be a fun cozy series.  I look forward to reading the further happenings at Hatteras West Inn.	2002-05-17

A mineral water company has requested the right to bottle part of its spring every day.  Part of the town thinks this is just what their economy needs, but the other part doesn't want the increase of people this would bring.  Agatha Raisin agrees to come out of retirement to handle the public relations for the company.  But then a body is found.  What side of the issue was the victim on?  Will this help or hurt Agatha's new job?  And can she find the killer before the launch of the label is ruined?<br />This book was my introduction to Agatha and her friends.  While she is a gruff woman with some vices I don't like, I found myself liking the character.  The sub-plots in her personal life seemed a bit immature, but I found them funny and the insecurity they brought out made me like the character.  My only real complaint was the plot.  While it did eventually pick up speed, much of the first half seemed slow to me, with not much advancement in the story.  But once things got moving, I was hooked and completely surprised by the ending.<br />This won't be my last case with Ms. Raisin.  I look forward to catching up on the back-story of this lovable crank and seeing where she goes from here.	2002-05-16

But Jemmy would disagree.  He's be given the job of official whipping boy and is punished every time the prince does something wrong.  And there's a reason the prince is called \\"Prince Brat\\" behind his back.<br />Jemmy dreams of running away, but is surprised when the prince announces one night that both of them are running away.  Before they know it, the outlaw Hold-Your-Nose Billy has kidnapped them.  Can Jemmy keep them both alive and get them back to the castle?  Or will the oblivious Prince Brat spoil his every plan?<br />I'd been intrigued by this book for some time, and finally had a chance to read it.  The story is quite fun.  While I saw the ultimate end coming, there were plenty of fun twists along the way that kept me engaged.  And I truly came to care for the characters; I'd love to know what happens to them next.<br />Kids will love this tale of adventure set in a time long gone, and adults will enjoy sharing it with them.  Get this book today for some good family reading time.	2002-05-15

The journey becomes more then she bargained for when she begins to have run-ins with the Gruman family.  Memories of time with her grandma mingle with the present happenings.  But will she make sense of it all?<br />Once again, Glynn Marsh Alam has proven what an outstanding writer she is.  The swamp, river creatures, and characters come boldly to life.  It's hard not to get lost in this world.  I had no trouble switching from the past to modern day happenings as the story unfolded.  The only reason I gave this book four stars is because of two scenes that detracted from my over all enjoyment of the story.<br />With that warning out of the way, I recommend all of Ms. Alam's books.  Her use of language to draw the reader in and make him feel a part of the surroundings makes her books stand out from many of her peers.  I hope to enjoy her writing for many years to come.	2002-05-10

Fellow Gospel music singer Jerry Webb has been accused of his cousin Tony's murder.  Alex can't believe that Jerry would do such a thing, so she talks her friend Stephen into helping her investigate the case.  There is no shortage of suspects, but Jerry really does seem to have the best opportunity.  Meanwhile, Alex's old crush on Jerry resurfaces, further complicating matters.  Can she figure out who the killer is and maintain her testimony?  Or is she blinding herself to the truth about Jerry?<br />Lorie Ham took the old adage \\"Write what you know\\" seriously.  A Gospel singer herself, she's able to provide an insider look at the good and bad of the industry.  The plot is very well developed.  Every time I thought I had something figured out, she added a twist that confused me again.  Yet everything comes together logically in the end.  The characters are interesting, and I look forward to getting to know them better as the series progresses.  My only real complaint was the writing style.  It was a little choppy at times, but smoothed out as the book progressed.<br />Lorie Ham is off to a fine start on her writing career.  I look forward to seeing where she takes Alex next.	2002-05-09

It's been six months since we last saw these first century characters.  Marcus has been in the wilderness searching for rebels, but has been called to Jerusalem for the holiday.  After the trouble caused by Herod, he's relieved to head back to Galilee to observe Yeshua for Pilate.  But he's not the only one.  Also searching are Nakdimon of the Sanhedrin, El'azar, notorious rebel bar Abba, and the orphan Avel.  When they find Yeshua, things start to heat up even more.<br />Once again, the Thoenes have written a moving novel that shows God's love and grace at work.  They weave Biblical stories so seamlessly into the narrative it's almost a shock when they appear.  In doing so, they offer a fresh insight into these familiar tales from the life of Christ.  The characters, as always, are well developed and bring the story to life.  I especially love their portrayal of Jesus.  You can feel his love and compassion flow off the page.  While this book has a moving and satisfying conclusion, they have also left things open for another novel in this time period.<br />While not quite as powerful as the previous book, it's still a compelling story worth reading.  I'm enjoying this break in the main story line of Israel's war for independence and am looking forward to seeing what the next book holds.	2002-04-11

He hopes that he can have some exciting adventures like those he's always read about.  But they start even sooner then he expected.<br />On his first morning there, he explores the creek, part of a county park.  To his surprise, he finds a possum caught in a trap.  Soon, he's trying to find the poacher with the help of his new friends Bits, Tiny, Lynn, and Mike.  But can they solve this mystery?<br />This is a great start to breathing new life into the Sugar Creek Gang name.  The characters are well developed, and all have something to contribute to the group and the plot.  The story moves along well, and the spiritual side of the story is fully explored without stopping the action.<br />This is a book that kids of all ages should enjoy.  I'm looking forward to reading the further adventures of the New Sugar Creek Gang.	2002-04-09

He still wishes his parents would get off his back, he still doesn't understand women, and he still dreams of making it big in music.  But whether he's trying to decide what to do about the upcoming Gingivitis concert, win back Sara from a sophomore, support a friend's mom who has cancer, or sneak over to his girlfriend's babysitting job, he's sure to find the humor in any situation.<br />Unfortunately, I don't get the strip in my local paper, so I have to wait for these books to enjoy it.  But I can certainly see why it has become such a popular strip.  Everyone can appreciate the humor in the storylines, which poke fun at everyone equally.  The visual gages are some of the best in the papers today and make for some of the best strips in the book as well.  And it's easy to like these characters because they really do have good hearts just beneath the surface.  My only complaint with this book is that the strips don't appear to be in order.  It makes for a little confusion when a character is first introduced after we've already met him or her, but over all, it really is minor.<br />This is a wonderful collection that should win new fans and satisfy the old.  Buy it today and enjoy the laughs.	2002-04-06

It's been nine months since her husband died.  Recently, she's moved into the town of San Celina and taken a job at the local artist co-op running the folk art museum, a job she's perfect for.  But then she finds one of the artists stabbed in the woodshop.  Since her cousin was seen fleeing the scene, she gets involved trying to find out what happened.  The stakes are raised when a second body is found.  Still trying to figure out her relationship with the temporary police chief, she plunges on, learning secrets she didn't want to know.  But can she find the killer before the killer makes her the next target?<br />What struck me most about this book was the characters.  Benni and police chief Gabe Ortiz jump off the page as fully realized characters.  I feel like I've known them for several books instead of just one.  Even the supporting characters are well developed.  The mystery itself is good, with some unexpected twists.  The writing style feels like that of a polished professional.  It's hard to believe this is a first novel.<br />This is the first in the Benni Harper series, and I look forward to reading the others.  If you enjoy a well-written mystery with fresh, three dimensional characters, this is the book for you.	2002-03-29

Hannah Swensen is delighted about the extra revenue this will bring to her cookie shop.  The town is thrilled to have Connie MacIntyre, celebrated TV chef and cookbook author, designing and baking their Winter Carnival cake.  But when Connie Mac arrives, she quickly makes enemies with her overbearing personality.  Hannah reluctantly agrees to let Connie use her shop to bake the cake, but arrives the next morning to find the cake burned and Connie face down in a tin of Hannah's Blue Blueberry Muffins.  With her shop closed off as a crime scene and a very good friend, Connie Mac's personal assistant Janie, the prime suspect, Hannah starts investigating the murder.  But can she provide the cookies for the carnival, solve the murder, and find Janie?<br />This is the third Hannah Swensen mystery, and the series has only gotten stronger.  Hannah and her sister Andrea make a great detective team.  All the supporting characters are back and used well in the plot.  They're really starting to feel like good friends.  I especially enjoyed watching the love triangle with dentist Norman and police detective Mike heat up.  The mystery itself was very enjoyable.  I had a hard time figuring out where this one was going, but the solution made perfect sense.  And the climax kept me glued to the book trying to figure out how Hannah would escape with her life.  There are 7 more delicious sounding recipes included.  Someday I'm going to make them.<br />My only complaint with the book was that it ended too soon.  If you're already a fan of the series, you'll love this book.  If you have yet to meet Hannah, start with the first, Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder, and enjoy this delightful culinary themed mystery series.	2002-03-15

Her Aunt Nettie needs someone to help with the business side of TenHuis Chocolade, a gourmet chocolate business in Michigan that Lee worked at as a teen.  But Lee's only been back in town for a week when famous defense lawyer Clementine Ripley is poisoned while eating one of their chocolates.  Clementine had made a lot of enemies over the years in her cases and seems to have just as many in the small resort town of Warner Pier.  Now Lee must sort through the suspects and motives to find the real killer before she and her aunt get framed for a murder they didn't commit.<br />I've been looking forward to this book since I read the short story in AND THE DYING IS EASY that introduced these characters.  And it didn't disappoint.  The characters are well developed.  Lee's way of mixing up words when she's upset or nervous is fun but not so overused that it becomes annoying and makes her more human.  The story is tightly plotted and moves along at a brisk pace.  The style invites the reader in and makes it very hard to put down.  The only thing that seems odd is the chocolate trivia scattered throughout the book.  It doesn't really add anything; it's just kind of there.<br />I am definitely addicted to the Chocoholic Mysteries and look forward to many more.  Pick up this book and enjoy a wonderful new series.	2002-03-07

When developer Hughes Barron is found poisoned with a cup of her tea in his hand, she's upset.  But when a friend becomes the prime suspect, Theo starts to investigate to find the real killer.  The late Mr. Barron was not a scrupulous man, so there is no shortage of suspects.  Even his partner had motive.  But can she find the killer before he comes after her?<br />I really enjoyed this book, however, it's obviously a first novel.  The writing style is a little wooden in spots, and the first chapter bogs down a little giving backgrounds of the series characters.  On the other hand, I was drawn in by the characters and really came to care for them.  The plot wasn't quite developed as well as it could have been, but it progressed well, was logical, and there were plenty of good red herrings to keep me guessing.  The setting was intriguing; I'd love to visit the area after reading this book.  And the tea aspect was just right.  I'm not a tea person, but the information was interesting enough without overshadowing the mystery.<br />Overall, the flaws were minor, and I really did enjoy this book.  The author shows a lot of promise, and I look forward to watching her talent develop as the series progresses.	2002-03-05

At the end of THE LONG NIGHT OF CENTAURI PRIME, Vir had been banished from the palace by Londo.  This book opens as the techno-mages find him and they set off to find the truth behind the excavation at K0643.  But that is not the end of the evil influence of the Drakh over Centauri Prime.  Slowly, Vir realizes he must start taking action if he is to save his world.<br />Peter David continues to shine as a writer in this book.  Once again, the characterizations from the series are perfect, and the references to events in both Babylon 5 and Crusade make the book lots of fun for the devoted fan.  Vir changes dramatically in this book into a leader.  Yet he powerfully retains his innocence and soul.  The book leaves you anxious to pick up the last book in the series to get the full picture of the events from WAR WITHOUT END.<br />That is my main problem with the story, however.  After the build up of the first book, this one seems to drag in spots.  It's like it knows it's just the placeholder between the opening and ending of the trilogy.  It's still worth reading; I was just expecting a bit more after the excellent first book.<br />Once again, the devoted Babylon 5 fan will enjoy this look into the story hinted at but never told in the series itself.  Readers not familiar with the series will still enjoy the story without being lost, but they won't fully grasp everything happening.  Either way, it will leave the reader anxious for the conclusion to the story of Centauri Prime.	2002-02-28

The opener is recording the entire show in order to steal the jokes.  When Biff tries to confront the young man after the show, he winds up unconscious.  While trying to track down the tape of his material, he gets involved in the dark side of town and finds Art's body.  What did Art know that was worth killing him for?  And can Biff find the answers without getting killed himself?<br />This book was a real departure from the cozy mysteries I normally read.  I found myself enjoying it, however.  The mystery moves along at a brisk pace with plenty of new information to keep the reader interested, and the characters were truly likeable.  Since the book stars a stand-up comic, there are some great one-liners sprinkled throughout the book.  I found myself laughing out loud several times and grinning to myself many others.  Still, the suspense of the story never lags in favor of the jokes.<br />If you like your detectives and mysteries with more of an edge, this is the book for you.  Pick it up and meet a great new detective in his first mystery.	2002-02-19

She's maid of honor in Jim's cousin's wedding, her cousin Hallie is visiting, and Bobby and Dan are both acting strangely.  To top this off, there's a wheelchair that keeps appearing and disappearing, and Di's family is robbed.  Can she solve the mystery before the wedding is ruined and still get her chores done?<br />I enjoyed this book in the Trixie Belden series.  Trixie's conflict with Hallie leading to their uneasy friendship is a fun change to watch.  The mystery proves a bit more dangerous then normal, but I enjoyed that for a change of pace.  All the Bob-Whites are present and pretty true to their characters.  They even get some chances to have fun, one of my favorite things in the series.<br />If you haven't read the previous book in the series, MISSING HEIRESS, you really should read it before you read this one since it actually follows up on that book.  But once you have, hang on for another fun adventure with Trixie and the gang.	2002-02-15

When he hears the plight of a baby dragon captured and enslaved by the residents of Wild Island, he leaves home to free the animal.  Armed only with gum, lollipops, magnifying glasses, hair ribbons, and other such items, he sets out.  But will this be enough to face lions, tigers, gorillas, and crocodiles?<br />This is a fun early reader chapter book.  The chapters are the perfect length to hook the beginning reader.  The story is imaginative, delightful, and downright funny in spots while still being simple enough for young kids to follow.  I reread it recently for the first time in years and was surprised at how short and simple it really was.  When I was a boy, it seemed much longer and more complicated.  There are numerous drawings that wonderfully highlight some of the funnier parts of the story.  Adults should enjoy it just as much as their kids.<br />Readers of this book will want to get the other two in the series and read the further adventures of Elmer.  This is a series that will be enjoyed for generations to come.	2002-02-14

Marcus is feeling restless.  His life of pleasure no longer holds any happiness for him.  Julia is finding that her friends really don't care for her, and she is fighting an illness that no one seems to be able to cure.  Their mother, Phoebe, prays constantly for their salvation.  Fortunately, God has not given up on them.  And the answer might come from the strange woman hidden in veils who assists the young doctor Alexander at his shop in the poor part of town.<br />Francine Rivers has once again captured the Roman empire of the 1st century AD.  Rome, Ephesus, and Israel come alive with compelling people and small historic details.  The theme of God's love and the power of forgiveness are beautifully shown through the lives of these characters.  The ending was so powerful, I'm sure it will stay with me for quite some time.<br />This novel is definitely a sequel to the first book in the series, A VOICE IN THE WIND.  Enough of the first book is explained so you won't be lost if you choose to read this one first.  However, since you'll ultimately want to read the first one, I recommend starting with it so none of the surprises will be spoiled.<br />These novels are some of the best Christian fiction I've ever read.  If you enjoy a good story with strong characters, you'll want to pick these up and read them today.	2002-02-13

He's just finishing up breakfast (pancakes, of course) when Annie calls.  She's lost the picture of her dog Fang that she just painted and wants help finding it.  So Nate goes over and helps her hunt down the leads.  But can he solve the mystery?<br />I remember this book well from my childhood, and it's still good for a few grins today.  Nate has some great one-liners, especially when read with a Joe Friday monotone.  The plot is very creative if a bit obvious at the end to adults.  The pictures only add to the pleasure.<br />This is the strongest book from the series.  Children will ask for it over and over; I know I did.  Parents will enjoy the humor and characters as well.  Buy it today for read aloud pleasure.	2002-02-12

As the events unfold, we are drawn into the lives of Ellie, David, Moshe, and Rachel and share their struggles, fears, hopes, and joys in the midst of a real war going on for the survival of Israel and the Jews.<br />I first read this series in the early 90's and reread it a couple years ago.  I was surprised at how much stuck with me.  I couldn't put the books down the first time, and had almost as much trouble on the reread.  The Thoenes are truly talented authors, deftly mixing character development with suspense and historical accuracy.  After reading this series, I added them to list of favorite authors.<br />This was the first series that the Thoenes wrote for the Christian market.  A reader who isn't familiar with their work can easily start here.  However, their Zion Covenant series does take place before this one and involve some, but not all, of the same characters.  They have finally written the next chapter in the amazing struggle of the Jews in their Zion Legacy series.<br />The Thoenes have proven time and time again they are among the best of today's Christian fiction writers.  If you haven't had the pleasure, don't hesitate.  You will find yourself swept away to another time and place and enjoy every moment of it.	2002-02-09

This time, she's been invited to profile Occles Hall by a friend from school.  Lady Valeria isn't completely happy about Daisy's presence, but agrees to let her continue.  While touring the winter garden, the discovery of a dead bush leads to the discovery of a body.  Grace Moss, the parlor maid, was presumed to have run away two months ago.  When Lady Valeria pressures the local police into arresting one of the estate gardeners, Daisy's observations convince her that an innocent man has been arrested.  She calls her friend Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher to come help, but can they solve a murder that's two months old?<br />This is the second book in the Daisy Dalrymple series, set in 1923 England.  It's a cozy with an emphasis on character and interviewing the suspects over tons of action.  But don't misunderstand; it's a great read.  Lady Valeria is a strong character, and watching the other characters try to work around her is lots of fun.  The pace of the story doesn't lag, with lots of new information and complications coming on a regular basis.  Daisy and Alec's relationship is also very fun to watch, as they are not willing to admit to any feelings between them.<br />If you're looking for a book with lots of shoot-outs and close calls, look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for a good mystery with great characters and an intriguing plot, this is the series for you.	2002-02-02

But what might have been his best chance to help his people and make up for his past becomes an exercise in frustration for him, as he must submit to the will of the Drakh Entire.  Watched over by his keeper, he is only fully able to do what they desire.  Meanwhile, Vir suspects something might be wrong with his friend.  But can he find out what is really happening in the palace?<br />Peter David has done a wonderful job with this book.  Londo becomes a truly sympathetic character.  The climax is almost painful it's so well written and leaves the reader anxious to pick up the next book.  Mr. David has captured each character exactly as they appear in the series.  It's very easy to &quot;hear&quot; the actors deliver the lines and picture the settings from the series.  He also works in references to several pivotal and obscure moments in the show, making this seem to fit perfectly in the Babylon 5 universe.  The new characters are fully developed and help advance the story.  Interesting, two of Londo's wives, from an episode of the show that Mr. David wrote, also play important parts in the story.<br />There is one small detraction for fans of the series.  The book plays a little loosely with the timeline of season 5.  However, I find the timeline presented here to be a little more realistic and something only worth noting in passing.<br /><br />Fans of Babylon 5 who haven't read this book are in for a real treat.  People who haven't seen the show will enjoy this book as well, but might be confused by a few things mentioned in passing.  Personally, I had trouble putting this book down and can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.  A truly top notch read.	2002-01-30

Hadassah has been captured at the fall of Jerusalem.  Taken to Rome, she is bought to serve the Valerian family.  The Valerians are having their own problems.  Decimus, the father, is very traditional, yet his children, Marcus and Julia, embrace all the decadence Rome has to offer.  Hadassah wants to share her faith in Jesus the Messiah with this family, but she cannot find the courage to do so.  Meanwhile, Atretes has been captured in Germany and taken to Rome as a gladiator.  As their lives intertwine, they will all face problems that will challenge who they are and what they believe.<br />I just read this book for the first time, and can't believe I waited so long to do so.  This is an amazing novel.  The characters are strong, the writing is crisp, the plots are remarkable, and the detail given to ancient Rome makes it come alive.  Every time I picked up this novel, I was drawn into its world and had a hard time putting it down.<br />This was my introduction to the books of Francine Rivers, but by no means will this be my last.  I am looking forward to finishing this series and exploring her other novels.  She is truly a gifted author.	2002-01-22

All three of the brides place the planning in her capable hands, leaving her running around trying to make sure all three weddings go smoothly.  Which isn't easy when one wants a theme wedding but won't decide on dresses, and another wants peacocks.  Then, an out-of-town visitor turns up dead under mysterious circumstances.  Meg's father is convinced it's murder and drags her into his investigation.  Soon, mysterious accidents convince Meg that her dad is right.  But can she find the murderer before anyone else dies and still make sure the weddings go as planned?<br />This is a fun book.  It's filled with eccentric characters that make it a pleasure to read.  I often found myself chuckling or laughing at their behavior.  However, as a mystery it leaves a little to be desired since solving the murder often takes a back seat to the antics of the brides and Meg trying to deal with them.  Still, I found the book a pleasure to read.  The characters come off as believable and not caricatures.  The romantic sub-plot with Michael is amusing because we as the reader know what's going on, even if Meg has no clue.  By the end of the book, the mystery has been solved and all the plots tied up, leaving me anxious for more.<br />An interesting note is that instead of chapters, the author breaks the action down by day.  It makes for rather uneven breaks in the narrative, but it's also easier to keep track of the passing time since the plot takes place over two months.<br />In lesser hands, this book would have fallen flat, but in her debut, Donna Andrews proves what a superb writer she is.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the Meg Langslow series.	2002-01-04

None are as persistent as Vivian Duncan, who is ready to retire from her wedding planning business.  When Vivian invites Maddie and her friends to an extravagant wedding held at the Nature Museum, they attend.  But before Maddie can convince Vivian that she seriously doesn't want the business, Vivian is found murdered and hanging from the triceratops skeleton.  Now Maddie is being pressured by Vivian's daughter to solve the crime and help keep the business going.  Can she find the killer and not become Vivian's successor, both in wedding planning and death?  Throw in a lawsuit over the sale of her first business and complications in her love life, and you've got a great read.<br />This book continues the fun Madeline Bean catering series.  All the great characters from the first two books are back and just as strong as ever.  The plot moved quickly, deftly balancing twists, sub-plots, and development of the new characters.  The climatic scene is a little clich&eacute;, but still a fun conclusion to a great entry in this series.<br />If you're already a fan of Maddie and co., be sure to read this great book.  If you've never met them, you're in for a real treat.  Grab the first book (SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL) and hang on for the wild, and incredibly fun, ride.	2002-01-03

Life doesn't get any easier for the Tribulation Force.  These Tribulation Christians are again in the middle of Bible prophecy, and just trying to survive.<br />Buck and Chaim have gone to Jerusalem to lead believing Jews to the refuge God has prepared for the rest of the Tribulation.  But to do that, they must face Nicolae as he plans to defile the temple.  Rayford must carry out the plans to ferry these Christians to their refuge, placing himself and many others in danger along the way.  Chang has to deal with the ramifications of having both the mark of God and the mark of Antichrist.  And Chloe investigates a strange site near the safe house, which leads to great danger for everyone in the Trib Force.  Meanwhile, God starts to unleash his wrath on those who have taken the mark of the beast.<br />People seem to be divided by these books, either loving them or hating them.  Personally, I enjoy the story while finding the writing and character development shallow.  Still, for fans of the series, this book is a must read.  It's fast paced, with many jaw-dropping scenes.  And the cliffhanger is the worst of the series to date.<br />If you aren't already a fan of these books, there's nothing here to change your mind.  If you're already a fan, this book will entertain you and leave you anxious for the next, due out in 2002.	2001-11-27

Fortunately, I decided to give the taped version a listen. After borrowing it several times from my local library, I bought my own copy to listen to every year.<br />Mr. Stewart does an outstanding job of bringing all the characters to life. Only a couple times in the two hours do I ever get a little lost as to who is saying which line, and then it's only for a few seconds. The combination of Dickens' words and Stewart's dramatization brings every character and description to vivid life.<br />It should be noted that this is an adaptation of the book. Some scenes have been cut, and other added for this recording. That doesn't interfere with my enjoyment, however, and I doubt that it will bother anyone else. I spend the two hours hanging on every word. It's over all too soon.<br />This has become a Christmas tradition I look forward to every year. Give it a try, and you will be captivated by it as well.	2001-11-27

Miryam is a lonely widow and Marcus is her centurion lover.  Because of her relationship with Marcus, Miryam has been outcast from her family and community.  Slowly, she is sinking into depression.  Marcus, meanwhile, must struggle with keeping the peace in this foreign land while avoiding his nemesis Vara.  From Capernaum and Nazareth to Caesarea Maritima and Jerusalem, the Thoenes weave a story full of political intrigue and personal struggle.  In the midst of this, our characters come in contact with the preacher Yeshua of Nazareth.  Will Miryam and Marcus let Him help them, or are they truly beyond hope?<br />When I first learned this book would take a break from the 1948 storyline, I was disappointed.  But I decided to give the book a far reading.  I'm glad I did.  The Thoenes have proven once again what wonderful storytellers they are.  This novel combines several Biblical stories with the fiction for a powerful tale of grace and mercy.  I was moved to tears several times while reading.<br />My only disappointment was that the story ended so soon.  While I hope the next novel continues with Moshe, Rachel, David, Ellie, Alfie, and the others, I would love to see a stand-alone novel about these characters.  There is certainly room for more.<br />I am curious to see if they will work this story into the overall storyline somehow, or if the prologue and epilogue will be the only connection with the rest of the series.<br />I cannot recommend this novel highly enough.  Their storytelling will enthrall their fans, and new fans will quickly be won over.  It is my favorite of their books to date.  Buy it and read it today.	2001-11-12

The last thing he wanted was to be involved in an adventure.  But when the wizard Gandalf invites a group of dwarves over, he find himself drawn into their quest to reclaim their mountain and fortune that a dragon stole from them years ago.  Now Bilbo will have to adjust to new situations daily as they encounter wolves, goblins, giant eagles and spiders, and other creatures just to get to the mountain.  Once they get there, they have to face the fierce dragon.  Can they survive?<br />This is a fun adventure.  It's very easy to feel for Bilbo as they face one obstacle after another.  &quot;He thought of his home, not for the last time.&quot;  I smiled every time I saw that line.  My biggest complaint about the book is that it is a bit episodic in nature.  Their many adventures don't seem that interrelated for most of the book.  This is a minor issue, however, and it's very hard not to like the characters and root them on in their quest to reclaim their rightful place.<br />I've read this book twice, and hope to get to the Lord of the Rings soon.  The fun story and likeable characters make it easy to see why there are so many fans of these books	2001-11-09

Dragging Bert along, she tries to prove she's right.  Meanwhile, Bert is more concerned about patching things up with her boyfriend, Hank, who believes Bert signed herself up for the dating service.<br />This book takes the mystery solving twins through yet another harrowing adventure.  The twin authors have once again provided plenty of suspense and laughs, and I could hardly put the book down.  The alternating narration continues to be an asset, helping with both character and plot development.  This is the fifth book in the series, and it shows no sign of slowing down at all.<br />Fans of the series will enjoy this book immensely, and I'm already looking forward to Nan and Bert's sixth outing.  If you've never read these books, do yourself a favor and get the first one (DOUBLE MURDER) today.	2001-10-27

When a realtor dies in a mysterious accident, Luanne realizes there is much more at stake.  Can she stay alive long enough to find the answers?<br />This follow up to last year's Dive Deep and Deadly is just as much fun as it's predecessor.  The plot and characters are well developed, and the author's sense of place is very well defined.  Using all five senses effectively, Ms. Alam manages to place the reader in Florida and Georgia right along with the characters.<br />I highly recommend both books in this series.  They are a real treat for the mystery lover.	2001-10-25

It starts out a little slow while the main characters are being introduced, but it soon catches its stride.<br />Jeremy Duncan is a typical teenager just trying to live his life. His parents are on his back, he's got homework to avoid, his garage band isn't getting recording contracts, and he's awkward around the girl of his dreams. Needless to say, his life is anything but boring.<br />The strip is written from Jeremy's point of view, which leads to some great sight gags as we see a situation through his eyes. The characters are slightly cartoonish but real enough for many years of great strips, and I look forward to enjoying it for years to come.	2001-10-04

Leigh has to find answers fast, before someone she loves gets hurt.<br />Edie Claire has written a wonderful debut mystery.  The characters are charming, and the plot is puzzling.  As we slowly get answers, we're only left with more questions to be answered until we finally reach the satisfying conclusion.<br />I've added this series to my list of books to read and am looking forward to Leigh's further adventures.	2001-09-17

Then there's the old letter she finds that seems to be a confession to murder. But who's confessing, when, and why? Then a priest, a friend of Xavier's, is murdered in a TV star's trailer, and things really start to heat up. Madeline is going to have to dig up some old secrets to figure this out before the Pope must cancel his visit to LA.<br />This is a thoroughly entertaining read from start to finish. The characters are charming and easy to like. The plot flows well with just the right mix of mystery and humor culminating in a perfectly logical and surprising ending.<br />I can't recommend this series highly enough. Start with the first, Sympathy for the Devil. You will enjoy this entertaining mystery series immensely.	2001-09-17

The telepath war is over, and many of the old Psi Corp leaders are on the run or in prison as war criminals. Bester has managed to evade his pursuers. But with Garibaldi using the Edgars' fortune to find him, can he stay hidden for much longer?<br />I will admit I didn't enjoy the other two books in this series as much as I had hoped I would. But, being a fan of the TV series, I kept reading. This book is much better then the others, partially because the author has a definite story to tell. The plot was engrossing, and I had a hard time putting it down. Keeping the tradition of the series alive, it doesn't give pat answers, but raises some interesting questions about telepaths and their treatment. The characterizations are top notch, and there are times I could &quot;hear&quot; Bester, Garibaldi, and Lise from the show.<br />This book may not break any new ground plot wise and probably won't appeal to anyone who hasn't watched the show, but for those who have, this is must reading that will hook them from start to finish.	2001-09-04

When he starts receiving threats, he knows he must be on the right track.  But what is it?  And why would someone kill the bird and cat after killing a nice woman with no enemies?<br />This book is a fun first novel.  Haskell's sense of humor adds much to the story.  The story develops well and reaches a good conclusion.  I'm glad I tracked down a copy of this novel after reading the author's Tatum twins mysteries (starting with DOUBLE MURDER).  I'm definitely looking forward to reading more in the series.	2001-09-04

Bruno Huntley had no shortage of enemies, including his own family. But Madeline's business partner and best friend, Wesley, is the police's prime suspect. Knowing that Wesley could never murder a man, even Bruno, she starts nosing around to find the real killer. But everywhere she turns, she just gets more questions. Can she stay alive long enough to unravel the personal and professional secrets and clear Wes?<br />This is a truly wonderful book. The plotting is superb, with never a dull moment and some surprising twists. The characters are well rounded and truly come alive. On top of this are an observer's view of Hollywood and a wonderful sense of humor. After finishing this book, I immediately went out and bought the rest of the series.<br />This is a must read. I look forward to many more adventures with Madeline, Wesley, and their friends.	2001-08-29
1865200:US	52868156	R1Y8SVS6RSE26K	1575666421	667917516	Double Dealer: A Bert and Nan Tatum Mystery	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Antiques are murder	When an unsavory antiques dealer is murder, Nan and Bert Tatum are question because of recent fights they've had with him. But when Bert's daughter Ellie is arrested for the murder after confessing, the twins dive head first into the case to find the real killer. Further complicating matters for Bert is her ex-husband. Jake wants back into her life and is using this case to drive a wedge between her and current boyfriend Hank, the detective assigned to the case and responsible for arresting Ellie.<br />This is the fourth book in the Tatum twin mystery series, which is still going strong. The characters have become so strong and familiar that I didn't have any trouble at all with the alternating narration. In fact, part of the fun of this book is seeing the personalities of the twins switch after Ellie is arrested. The plot is slow in a couple places, but over all flows very smoothly.<br />If you're already a fan of these twins, this book is for you. If you haven't meant them yet, start with the first, DOUBLE MURDER. You won't regret it at all.	2001-08-24

Booked well in advance, she has the privilege of selecting her customers.  So she's a little surprised when she discovers she's booked a hunting party led by a well-known Senator and an anti-hunting, animal rights group for the same week, the opening week of hunting season.  With the varying dietary requirements of the two groups, she has her hands full keeping the guests happy and fed while keeping her cook in the kitchen and her sister in line.  And that's before the first body shows up!<br />As a mystery this book is a little slow.  The first body doesn't show up for quite some time, and then it's the one guest we've forgotten about.  Still, there is plenty of conflict to keep the reader going and I never felt the pace lagged.  The guests are interesting characters, however the characters that are to be regulars seem like they could become annoying caricatures.  Still, this is a fun, promising first novel and I plan to read more books by this author.	2001-08-14

But when her aunt gets sick, she accepts the Battlefields and Gardens of Virginia tour, which she dubs Guns and Roses.  Things turn disastrous right from the start with one prank after another.  Everyone from the new millionaires to the newly weds falls victim.  But when the tour reaches Williamsburg, things turn deadly.<br />Taffy Cannon has written a wonderful book in what I hope will be a new series.  The plot was quite tangled, and only near the end did I get any inkling what was going on.  The characters were fun, and while some might have been a little stereotypical, they served their purpose well.  The story brought Williamsburg to life, and I can't wait to visit.  It was also interesting to see some of the behind the scenes working of a town devoted to tourists.  The author switches view point characters on a regular basis, which adds another layer to this mystery.<br />I recommend this enjoyable mystery to anyone who likes a good puzzle.	2001-08-13

The book follows his life as he struggles with his ambition and his desire to be loved.  Interestingly for fans of the Babylon 5 TV show, Lyta and Byron have cameos and this book ends with Bester about to leave for his first trip to the station.<br />Fans of the series will enjoy this book.  J. Gregory Keyes has done a good job of capturing Bester and making him sympathetic.  Bester truly becomes a well-rounded character whose motives we can understand, even if we don't agree with them.  This is something I enjoyed about the show itself, and I'm glad to see it continued here.<br />However, this book suffers from the same problem as the first in the trilogy - no real plot.  It follows Bester for 68 years, and as such reads more like a biography.  There is no real climax; it just ends.  The other characters just serve the purpose of helping us understand Bester and are not super interesting on their own.<br />Any fan of Babylon 5 will enjoy this novel because of the information on Bester.  New comers to the series will be more interested once they've viewed the show.	2001-07-31

Ranging from well known to new authors, the list includes the following: Jeff Abbott, Lydia Adamson, Ann Campbell, JoAnna Carl, Edie Claire, Max Allan Collins, Selma Eichler, Hazel Holt, Peter King, John Lantigua, Sam McCarver, Tamar Myers, Dana Stabenow, Andy Straka, Denise Swanson, Peter Trenayne, Judith Van Gieson, k.j.a. Wishnia, Matt Witten, and Wayne Worcester.  Most of the authors write stories using their series sleuths, but a few take the opportunity to introduce a new character from a new series.<br />With only a couple exceptions, I enjoyed the 20 stories presented here.  This book confirmed my opinion of several authors I had already read and introduced me to several new authors I'm looking forward to trying.  I will be watching anxiously for the new series introduced here.<br />This is a great way to get a feel for many different authors.  If you like cozy mysteries, this book is fun summer reading and will introduce you to some new friends.	2001-07-25

Samuel Keaton has stayed off the bottle and tried to get on with his life, but it hasn't been easy.  But then two Texas Rangers show up looking for a man brutally murdered in January.  Instead of answering Sam's questions, they try to kill him.  A beautiful woman also shows up, claiming a connection between the dead man and the death of her sister.  Hardly trusting her, Sam follows the trail to Pennsylvania, where his life is in danger around every turn.  Can he stay alive long enough to sort through all the clues and reach the right conclusion?<br />This book had me hooked from the moment I picked it up.  Every time you get one answer, it leaves you with more questions.  Sam, his friends, and their world are so realistic, that it draws you right in.  I must disagree with the previous reviewer because I didn't feel the ending was rushed at all but reached a logical and fulfilling conclusion.  And the epilogue tying up Sam's personal life left me smiling for hours.<br />This series is must reading.  I plan on rereading these books many times over the years to come.	2001-07-17

Interested in travel, Wentworth is over his head when a body is found in New York with Mark Twain's name in his pocket.  Does it have anything to do with Twain's plans to dig up a fortune in gold mid-trip?  And is the killer on board their ship all the way on the Mississippi?<br />This book is an enjoyable jaunt down the Mississippi with Mark Twain on a riverboat.  The main characters were enjoyable, and I especially enjoyed the portrayal of Twain.  The plot was a little weak, however.  The information on riverboats and the river was interesting, but too much attention was paid to it, with little advancing the story.  Still, once a second body is found, the plot kicks into high gear.  I was caught off guard by the revelation of the killer, but everything fit together logically.<br />I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this historic mystery series.	2001-07-10

Using her wealthy background, she gets a job for a magazine photographing and writing about the famous Wentwater Manor.  Not too long after she arrives, one of her fellow guests is found dead in a hole in the ice.  At first, it's thought to be an accident, but soon Daisy is convinced it's murder.  Aiding the handsome Scotland Yard detective assigned to the case, she does her best to find the truth while keeping the family out of scandal.<br />This is a fun mystery set in 1923 England.  I was drawn into Daisy's world and was quite curious about what was really going on.  Having said that, the plotting did seem a bit uneven.  Still, it moved along nicely and reached a conclusion that was surprising and satisfying at the same time.  The characters are almost all English aristocracy, and it was interesting getting a glimpse into their world at a less then ideal time.  The dialog was so good that I could hear the accents most of the time.<br />I'm looking forward to reading the other books in this fun, historical series.	2001-06-28

She finds a body tied to an underwater cave, but the next morning, it's gone.  Exploring a second cave, she finds a second body.  Is there a connection?  And if so, what is it?  And who is the unidentified first woman and where is her body?<br />This is a wonderful debut book.  The plot develops nicely, and the characters are interesting as well.  The real star here is the setting.  Ms. Alam is able to bring the swamp to life using all five senses in a way that places you right there without overshadowing the characters or story.  I was completely drawn into this world, enjoying every minute of it.<br />I highly recommend this entertaining mystery and am looking forward to the second book in this series.	2001-06-21

Amanda Pym, an American who recently saved the lives on a hijacked plane, has been kidnapped.  Believing that she is still alive, Carstairs sends Mrs. Pollifax and Farrell to Syria to track down the truth.  By following notes left for them and attending secret rendezvous, they start to track down clues.  But is she alive?  Can Mrs. Pollifax free her if she is?<br />This is the fourteenth and latest is the long running and always enjoyable Mrs. Pollifax series.  The plot is nothing out of the ordinary for this series, but enjoyable just the same and included a few interesting twists.  Mrs. Pollifax is as resourceful as ever, and the cast of new characters is interesting and lively, especially Joe.<br />I recommend this book for any fan of the series.  If you haven't read any yet, start with the first (UNEXPECTED MRS. POLLIFAX).  You won't regret it.	2001-06-21

One day, there in a murder in her niece's apartment building.  She is asked to clear the grocery boy accused of the murder, but then another murder takes place.  Are the two connected?  And what can she do about her attraction to one of the suspects?<br />I started out liking the book.  I found the humor fun and the character likable.  But the plot was boring.  I figured out a key plot point chapters before Desiree did.  There is a subplot concerning a friend's husband that adds nothing but pages to the story.  The plot advances very little until the climax is reached.<br />I was disappointed I wasted my time with this book.  It is a great character destroyed by a weak plot.	2001-06-07

Bert is still trying to get back on her feet after her divorce.  Living next door to her identical twin, Nan, she's currently working as a secretary for a nasty divorce lawyer, Stephanie.  The only reason she hasn't quit in search of a better boss is that her Mom and Stephanie's Mom are good friends.  But one morning, she goes into work to find that her boss has been shot.  Having solved two previous murders (DOUBLE MURDER and DOUBLE EXPOSURE), Bert and Nan try to sift through the many people with grudges against Stephanie to find the killer.  Meanwhile, Bert is feeling insecure about her relationship with her boyfriend, homicide detective Hank Goetzmann.<br />It's great to see the twins back in action.  As always, they tackle their latest case with humor.  However, this book was a bit slow compared to the others, which is why I'm only giving it four stars.  It's enjoyable, but just not quite as good as the first two.	2001-05-18

Over the coarse of the book, we get to see him become involved in a number of adventures during the early 1800's.  He takes over a captured ship and helps with fights on other ships and forts among other adventures.<br />Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this book.  I really didn't like Hornblower's actions in the first story, and it took most of the book for me to get over that.  The sailing terms could have used better explanations as well.<br />Still, there were some entertaining moments in the book.  I especially enjoyed the story where he went for his first test for the rank of lieutenant.<br />I've heard enough positive things about the series that I will probably read the next one.  But this book wasn't the engaging start to the series I expected.	2001-05-17

But Mel is convinced that he was really murdered for something he knew.  And when her life is threatened as she starts the investigation, she concludes she was right.<br />I really wanted to like this book.  The idea of an investigator fictionalizing a case appealed to me.  But I was disappointed.  The plotting was uneven, sometimes causing me to skim ahead to get back to the story.  The characters seemed stiff and I really didn't come to care for any of them.  The solution was satisfying, however.  With a good editing job, this book could have gone from poor to enjoyable.	2001-05-04

But nothing ever happens in her small community on the edge of the Sioux reservation.  One day, on the way to school, she sees a suspicious stranger examining the Jackson house.  And the school bully won't leave her, her best friend Tommy, and their new friend Meagan alone.  Then the museum in Tommy's house is robbed and mysterious guests arrive at Rinnah's family's guest house.  Soon, Rinnah has more excitement then she knows what to do with.  Can she figure out what is really going on?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this fast moving young adult mystery.  All the characters are well developed.  The plot is complicated enough to keep me guessing with a couple of nice twists, but comes to a logical conclusion.<br />This book is a definite step ahead of the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books and I'm looking forward to Rinnah's further adventures.	2001-05-04

The Jewish quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem is fighting for it's very life, cut off from the rest of the world.  They are rationing food and water, but only fairing a little better then the New City, also under siege.  While the defenders try to hold out, their commander struggles to get back to the quarter from the Arab controlled area.  And others try to break the Arab blockade keeping the entire city from getting fresh supplies.<br />The more of the Thoenes' books you have read, the more you will enjoy this one.  Many of the characters have appeared in previous series, specifically the Zion Chronicles and Zion Covenant series.  I also found rereading the end of the last book helpful since this one starts immediately after.  Of course, reading the Thoenes' novels is a pleasure because of their skill as storytellers.<br />I enjoyed this book more than the previous two in the series because the action takes place in many different settings.  It moves quickly, and the authors do a great job of balancing the large cast of characters.  The characters are also well developed, especially considering the book is set during a war.  As always, the history presented is accurate as well.<br />This book is a must for any fans of the Thoenes' previous work and people interested in the time period presented.  I highly recommend this novel.	2001-04-26

But Henry's dog Ribsy is causing trouble.  So they make a deal, if Henry can keep Ribsy out of trouble for a month, Mr. Huggins will take him fishing.  Henry thinks it'll be easy, but he soon learns it's going to be harder then he thought.<br />This book was my first introduction to Beverly Cleary, so it holds a special place in my heart.  Henry's adventures are real, funny, and heart-warming.  The chapter &quot;Ramona and the PTA&quot; is not to be missed; it's a riot.<br />I highly recommend this kid's classic.	2001-04-20

I enjoyed it so much then, I went out and read the author's other books.  I recently picked this one up again and was amazed at how powerful it still was to me.<br />The story concerns Daniel, a young Jew at the time of Christ.  He has an intense hatred of the Romans and lives with in an outlaw band in the hills.  When his grandmother dies, he must move to the village to take care of his sister while trying to continue his life's mission of driving the Romans back to Rome.  He is drawn to the miracle worker, but just doesn't know what he truly thinks about him.  Is he the Messiah sent to free them from the Romans?  And will his sister ever recover?<br />Ms. Speare was able to create a complex plot that is simple enough for her target age to understand, but still captivating to adults.  I got so caught up in the events when I was rereading that I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this children's novel to readers of all ages.	2001-04-20

Not all are related to that story arch, however.<br />It starts with the first IMAGINATION STATION adventure, in which Digger Digger Digwillow goes back in time to experience the death and resurrection of Christ. I'm now 26, have heard the program multiple times, and this simple two parter still moves me to tears.<br />Other non-Blackgaard episodes include the classic Barclay family vacation in Odyssey (OUR BEST VACATION EVER) and the introduction of Wonderworld in the hilarious HEATWAVE.<br />The other episodes all revolve around the initial Blackgaard arch. They include A BITE OF APPLESAUCE, EUGENE'S DILEMMA, CONNIE GOES TO CAMP, THE NEMESIS, and THE BATTLE. These last three are two parters. As a whole, these make a great story, but are even more interesting when listened to in relation to later Blackgaard episodes. The summer they first aired, they kept my brother and I glued to the radio wondering what would happen next.<br />I highly recommend this great collection. It's radio drama at its best: good story telling and great characters.	2001-04-19

As our main character struggles with his personal problems and guilt, he also interacts with Jesus.  Will he see the true freedom that Jesus offers before time runs out for both of them?<br />I was blown away when I read this book.  Sigmund Brouwer weaves a fictitious story around the real events of the Bible seamlessly.  And his account of the Bible story is eye opening.  While fictitious, it made me look at the people involved in a different light.  I have a new understanding of what Jesus did for all of us because of it.<br />I also read Sigmund Brouwer's THE CARPENTER'S CLOTH at the same time.  There are some overlapping passages between the two books, but both are well worth a read and include material not in the other.	2001-04-16

Sigmund Brouwer takes his novelist's eye and creates an engaging new look at the old story, bringing the story to life in a new way.<br />I also read his full-length novel THE WEEPING CHAMBER at the same time.  Many of the vignettes from this book are included in that book, but both books offer original material, too.  If you enjoyed this book, get a copy of the other.  It is even more powerful then this one.	2001-04-16

I went into this book looking forward to learning more of the history of the Psi Corp, the group I loved to hate from the Babylon 5 TV show.  I was disappointed, however.  This book covers the birth of the Psi Corp after the discovery of Telepaths on earth.  It also covers the resistance movement during the early years.  However, it tries to cover too much territory.  The action takes place over 100 years and includes a couple generations of characters.  As a result, it doesn't appear to be really focused on anything or anyone.  It comes across as more of a history then a novel.<br />This book is interesting reading for the Babylon 5 fan, but not an engrossing novel.  The other two books in this trilogy do focus the characters and action more, so I hope that when I get a chance to read them I will like them better.	2001-04-12

He is letting a new friend, Mr. Hyde, take over his life, and his friends don't like it.  They try to warn him that Mr. Hyde is dangerous, but Dr. Jekyll won't listen.  Only after Dr. Jekyll and a friend die tragically, does anyone learn the horrifying truth.<br />If you've seen any of the movies or the recent stage musical, please forget them when reading this book.  It is ten times better.  While most of the suspense of the book, what is Dr. Jekyll's relationship to Mr. Hyde, has been ruined since the book first came out, that is no reason to skip the book.  I was surprised to find this book is really an allegory about the struggle between good and evil in each of us.  This novella is easy to read, but gets very powerful in the last section, Dr. Jekyll's account of the case.<br />This is one classic that everyone should read.  Don't hesitate.	2001-04-10

When her friend Danielle Watson calls and asks Hannah to come over, she is surprised to find that Danielle's husband Boyd has been murdered in their garage.  The police suspect Danielle because of Boyd's abusive history.  But Hannah is convinced that she's innocent and starts her own investigation.  While staying a step ahead of the police, Hannah finds blackmail, town secrets, and a second body.  But can she find the killer before he or she decides Hannah knows too much?<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed with this book.  I saw several plot points coming long before they did.  Also, I would have liked to see more of Hannah's family and friends.  These wonderful characters helped make the first book for me, but they had a significantly smaller roll here.<br /><br />Still, the overall mystery and motives were great.  And I loved seeing the relationship between Hannah and her sister Andrea mature.  These two provided some great laughs and smiles.  The setting, Minnesota in December, was so vivid it made me shiver from cold.  And it includes 7 more delicious sounding recipes including some I wished were in the first book.<br /><br />I recommend this book and am looking forward to the next in this wonderful series, hopefully with a little more character development for the wonderful cast of supporting characters.	2001-04-06

That's the basis for this Christian thriller.  Dr. Jonathan Weber has made this startling discovery.  While he searches for the answers, the rest of the world panics.  Millions abandon the faith while some still take the Bible at it's word and believe that Dr. Weber has uncovered the hoax of the century.  His investigation seems to lead no where, but is there a light at the end of the tunnel?<br />I really have a mixed reaction to this book.  The first hundred pages drag.  It takes that long for our characters to find what they have.  Meanwhile, the reader is bored waiting to learn something not on the back of the book.  This part could have been told in 50 pages and kept the reader's interest more.  Once the story gets going, it is interesting.  The reactions of the general populace really made me examine what my faith was in, archeology or God's word.  Still, the story spends a little too long on the archaeology details before it reaches its satisfying conclusion.<br />A good editing job could have taken this book from a mediocre book to a great Christian novel.	2001-04-04

Boy was I wrong!  This book is a wonderful insight into the mind behind my favorite strip of all time.<br />Bill Watterson spends the first part of the book talking about everything from character names and personalities to his fights to keep his characters from being over commercialized.  While I wish there were more products available, I do respect him for sticking to his principles on this.  He also talks about the format of the Sunday strips.<br />The rest of the book is a collection of strips, starting with the very first.  What is interesting here is Mr. Watterson's commentary.  Whether it's the idea behind or an amusing story that happened because of a strip, it's all very entertaining.  It also brings out some of the themes talked about it the strip.  He also discusses the ideas behind such staples as the wagon, Calvin's box, and Spaceman Spiff.<br />I truly miss this wonderful strip because of its creativity and insights into our American culture.  This book shows the behinds the scene story in an entertaining and informative way.	2001-04-04

Still, they have no desire to investigate another murder.  But then Nan meets Crane Morgan.  He's handsome and romantic, and Nan is swept completely off her feet.  But Bert has reservations, especially when Louise Eagleston tells her that Crane's identical twin was accused of murder but committed suicide.  When Bert goes to hear more from Louise, she finds Louise shot.  Now, Bert wants to know more about what's going on, but Nan doesn't want to hear anything bad about Crane or his late brother.  Can Bert find the truth while keeping both herself and Nan alive?<br />This is a fun book.  The twins alternating narration is a nice and often funny touch and their personalities get better defined.  I figured out the ending before the twins, but by then I was so concerned for them that I had to keep reading.  These are great characters that I hope I can keep reading about for years to come.	2001-03-24

But things aren't as simple as arresting the occasional drunk.  There's the traveling revivalist in the cell arrested for attempted murder who taunts Samuel whenever he's in the office.  Then there's the double murder in the bank vault set up to look like a robbery gone wrong.  And, to make matters worse, a gang of confederates has wandered into town.  While they aren't causing any trouble, the townsfolk blame them for everything bad happening in town and are mad at Samuel because he's not taking any action.  His hands are tied, however, because of lack of evidence.<br />Sigmund Brouwer has written another great book.  Samuel Keaton's world is enhanced by the introduction of Doc and Jake.  The mystery is very engaging and the writing style is relaxed, inviting the reader to sit back and enjoy.  I highly recommend this entertaining mystery, originally released as &quot;Moon Basket.&quot;	2001-03-19

Except for one thing.  He just happens to be the only kid on the experimental station on Mars.  In fact, he was born on Mars and has never been to Earth.  However, when the station starts getting low on oxygen, he and the others may not live to see the next supply shuttle.  Tyce must use his knowledge and virtual reality skills to solve the problem.<br />Sigmund Brouwer has created a promising character in Tyce.  I was most interested to learn of Tyce's disability.  The setting is realistic sci-fi, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of this world.  My only disappointment was in character development.  Tyce, as narrator, is well developed, but the other characters are overlooked.  A little longer book would have helped with this, but I'm sure with the base of this book, other chapters in the series will add to the other characters, too.	2001-03-17

Not all are related to that story arch, however.<br />It starts with the first IMAGINATION STATION adventure, in which Digger Digger Digwillow goes back in time to experience the death and resurrection of Christ.  I'm now 26, have heard the program multiple times, and this simple two parter still moves me to tears.<br />Other non-Blackgaard episodes include the classic Barclay family vacation in Odyssey (OUR BEST VACATION EVER) and the introduction of Wonderworld in the hilarious HEATWAVE.<br />The other episodes all revolve around the initial Blackgaard arch.  They include A BITE OF APPLESAUCE, EUGENE'S DILEMMA, CONNIE GOES TO CAMP, THE NEMESIS, and THE BATTLE.  These last three are two parters.  As a whole, these make a great story, but are even more interesting when listened to in relation to later Blackgaard episodes.  The summer they first aired, they kept my brother and I glued to the radio wondering what would happen next.<br />I highly recommend this great collection.  It's radio drama at its best: good story telling and great characters.	2001-03-17

So when a stranger approaches Bert on the street, she assumes the stranger is looking for Nan.  Only later does she find out that Nan didn't know him either.  By that point, he's dead.  Nan, curious as to how a complete stranger knew them, drags Bert into the investigation.  But it's soon clear that they are both in real danger and the only way to get out alive is to solve the case themselves.<br />This book is a lot of fun.  The &quot;gimmick&quot; of alternating chapters from Bert and Nan is part of it.  It took me awhile to get used to it, but it brings out the humor in the different points of view.  The authors, identical twins themselves, have done a good job of creating very great characters.  Nan and Bert are very different, and the other characters are also well defined.  The plot moves along at a quick pace and reaches a logical conclusion.  A great first novel in an enjoyable series.	2001-03-16

It starts with a short biography of Jim Davis before he started drawing Garfield and details his struggles getting the strip started.  It then gives some background to all the characters, even the MIA Lyman.  Then it gets into the heart of the book, strips from all 20 years, showing the evolution of the characters and drawing style.  There are occasional comments from Jim that help give more insight.  Other highlights include drawings from Mr. Davis's sketchpad that were inspirations for strips, his top 20 strips of all time, all 20 of Garfield's birthday strips, and appearance or references to Garfield in other strips.<br />I've been a Garfield fan for a number of years now.  I greatly enjoyed getting a look into the creative process that gives us such a wonderful daily treat.  Any fan of the fat cat will love the book.	2001-03-14

As many of his books do, it starts out seemly simple, but soon gets very complicated.  Samuel Keaton, our hero, accidentally gets involved in a shoot-out, saving an Indian's life.  While on the run, he realizes that he has gotten involved in a case involving several crimes from years before, including his own past.  With Indians and the law on his tail, can he evade all his pursuers long enough to get the answers and clear his name?<br />Having read others in this series first, I greatly enjoyed getting to meet the characters for the first time.  The other books hint at the events contained in this book, so it was nice to finally get the complete picture.  While his past being resolved by the modern plot may be convenient, it also makes for a great story.  As always, Sigmund Brouwer weaves a good story with well-defined characters.  It's great to see Bethany House reprint this book, formerly entitled Morning Star.	2001-03-13

Then, one by one, the members start to be murdered.  With her position within the group, Kate starts to investigate her friends to find out who is behind it.<br />This is a great book.  I was drawn into the world of small town America during World War II from the first page.  The characters are well constructed and interesting.  And the plot is great.  I was hooked, and completely surprised by the ending.  If you enjoy a good who done it, pick up this book.  You won't be disappointed.	2001-03-08

Assisting her brother-in-law, she starts investigating.  But everyone seems to have an alibi and no motive.<br />This book was a complete delight from start to finish.  I loved the small town Minnesota setting.  Hannah's relationship with her family had me laughing and feeling for her at the same time.  The other characters were enjoyable, too, and Hannah is a very likable heroine.  Her cat adds charm to the story.  I was hooked on the plot from the very beginning and was as frustrated as Hannah when she hit a dead end.  Her cookies sounded absolutely wonderful, and I can't wait to try the recipes.  Definitely don't read this book while hungry!<br />As soon as I can get my hands on the next book, I'm going to start reading it.	2001-03-08

While her fianc&eacute;e and brother are fighting overseas, she's doing all she can to help the war cause from her small town in Pennsylvania.  But when a high school friend is found dead in lover's lane, Kate must use her love of mystery novels to find out who is really behind the killing.  Meanwhile, she must also adjust to her new job in the man's world of the steel plant.<br />This book really does a great job of setting time and place.  I missed the 40's by a number of years, but I still felt like I was right there.  And the main characters are well drawn.  I really felt for Kate, wanting her family to come home from the war safe.<br />However, as a mystery, I was a disappointed.  The book starts out well.  But about half way through it gets sidetracked.  There is too much time spent around Kate's first days working at her new job at the steel plant.  While interesting, they slow down the pace of the story.  When the book kicked into high gear for the climax, I felt something got glossed over in the hurry to finish the story within the correct number of pages.  Still, the story did come to a satisfactory end, and I was interested enough to pick up the next book in the series.	2001-03-07

Before they've even been there 24 hours, another body is found buried at the scene of the murder. With an attacker trying to stop them from leaving the valley alive, they continue investigating, hoping to find the killer before he or she gets them. To make matters worse, a group of aging Hell's Angles has taken over the park, and Jack is caught in the crossfire between the park rangers and the bikers. It seems that the park will erupt in violence before Jack can even solve his first mystery.<br />This is a good mystery that kept me guessing until the last minute. The clues and red herrings are everywhere. Not to give anything away, but I didn't even interpret all the clues correctly. Yet, everything fit together perfectly in the end. The characters were really intriguing, too.  I loved some of the interaction between Jack and Ev.  I highly recommend this excellent book.	2001-03-02

There is a war cry coming from both the Indians and the Army, and to end the blood bath, Sam must get sober again and find out the real reason for the deaths.<br /><br />As a fan of murder mysteries, I have grown used to people dieing.  This book, however, has over 50 deaths.  It also features a sad breakup between Sam and his girlfriend.  It does deal realistically with the issues of Indian/Settler relatons in the early west.  It is well written.  I give it a 6 because it is so serious.  When I had finished it, I was truly depressed.  This is not light reading.	1997-02-12

Jack Prestor, National Parks Special Agent, is sent to Death Valley to investigate the murder of an accountant.  The accountant had been investigating the disappearance of funds from the park.  Ev Brant is sent in to continue the investigation where the accountant left off.  Before they've even been there 24 hours, another body is found buried at the sceen of the murder.  With an attacker trying to stop them from leaving the valley alive, they continue investigating, hoping to find the killer before he or she gets them.  To make matters worse, a group of aging Hell's Angles have taken over the park, and Jack is caught in the crossfire between the park rangers and the bikers.  It seems that the park will errupt in violence before Jack can even solve his first mystery.<br /><br />This is a good mystery that kept me guessing until the last minute.  The clues and red herrings are everywhere.  Not to give anything away, but I didn't even interrpret all the clues correctly.  Yet, everything fit together perfectly in the end.  I highly recommend this exelent book.	1997-02-02

A bored Mrs. Pollifax decides to take up spying to enliven her life. Her first assignment sends her to Mexico, but it isn't long before she's in Albania as a prisoner.  Her escape is truly amazing.<br />The book dragged a little in the middle while she is a prisoner, but I read the last third in one sitting; there was no place to put it down and not have Mrs. Pollifax in trouble!	1997-01-31
