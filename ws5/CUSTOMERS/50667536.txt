I heard of the 'Ring' movies, the original Japanese film and the American remake ... but hadn't seen either one.  So I thought perhaps reading the book, which received fine accolades from amazon.com reviewers, a try.  I'm glad to say it was a terrific read.  Order it.  Read it.  ...NOW! <br /> <br />Well maybe I should share a bit more about the book.  It concerns a Tokyo-based newspaper reporter investigating the curious deaths of his niece and, separately, her classmates.  At first the deaths seemed coincidental, albeit similarly bizarre (sudden heart failure).  As he and his cronies investigate they get trapped into a web of surreal, paranormal mischief and terror.  They discover their own lives are at risk and are racing against time to find the answers.   ... and that's all I should share with you.  Anything more would contain spoilers, and this book would be ruined if spoilers are divulged. <br /> <br /> <br />SUMMARY: an original, supernatural thriller that indeed thrills.  Well-written, even for a translation.  Strongly recommended.	2005-10-01

Some were clever and bitingly satiric, particularly 'Strip Tease' and 'Skin Tight', others were fine but a bit predictable ('Tourist Season', 'Stormy Weather', 'Lucky You', ... and the rest).  However with 'Skinny Dip' Carl Hiaasen has decided to rehash elements of earlier work, not bothering to drum up a clever plot or scathingly clever dialogue, and thereby greatly disappointing his fans. <br /> <br />Oh, the plot in 'Skinny Dip' is simple.  Husband throws wife overboard on anniversary cruise, wife miraculously survives and teams up with an ex-cop (of course super cool, mellow, sexy, ad nauseum) to torment husband to the point of insanity.  Sprinkle in an assortment of odd characters who make the husband's life even worse, add a minor subplot or two, and .. voila!  A very formulaic novel.  Boo!! <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: Hiaasen moves down a notch or two with this weak effort.  Give it a miss.	2005-09-25

His prose is of high quality, characterizations livid and entertaining.  I'm glad to say 'The New Confessions' is standard William Boyd material.  It is a faux autobiography of a Scotsman as he reminisces through his full life of the first three quarters of the twentieth century.  He experiences the horror of trench warfare in WW I, he becomes a famous silent film director of the Germany avant-garde cinema, and then lives several years in turbulent Hollywood before retiring on an island in the Mediterranian.  He is no hero, and not a particularly nice guy.  But is life story is very rich; I wish I had a grandfather like him! <br /> <br />However 'The New Confessions is not perfect.  The ending is a bit of a disappointment, and overall the book seems too much like his 'Any Human Heart' (..which he wrote later but I read earlier).  I do wish William Boyd would return to the stellar form he demonstrated with 'Brazzaville Beach', a less ambitious but much more powerful novel. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: thoroughly competent but Boyd can do better.  Still, any average effort by Boyd is worthy read.	2005-09-18

'Naked Prey' by John Sandford is yet another installment of his very successful 'prey' series starring the scruffy yet lovable Twin Cities police investigator, Lucas Davenport.  In it we have nasty crime in northern Minnesota.  The surroundings and people are reminiscent of the movie 'Fargo'.  Little town, big crime, dead cold.  Although Sandford does write well and the story moves along reasonably well, the book felt more like a script of the television series 'Matlock' or 'Barnaby Jones' than proper literature. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: an excellent \\"oh, what book should I grab for this long flight\\"-kind of book.  Enjoyable yet thoroughly forgettable.	2005-09-03

His victims are typically the upper class, snobby English or, in his earlier works, the hypocritically rascist South Africans.  Although very popular in the UK, his books are almost unknown in America ... too bad! <br /> <br />In 'Ancestral Vices' we have a loosely stiched story about a crusty and warped aristocratic family, a befuddled biographer, victimized dwarves, and a murder.  It's a total farce.  However the author's wit and humor are lethal, and the story somehow holds together until the very end (or near so). <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: perhaps not a classic but 'Ancestral Vices' does Tom Sharpe some justice.  Recommended.	2005-08-25

It is well-written, interesting at times, but inevitably feels rather aimless.  The story concerns itself with a young woman in London suffering from amnesia.  As she (very) slowly pieces together who she was it becomes clear that all is not what it seems.  Think in terms of surreal and existential and you'll have an idea what this book is like.  Unfortunately the ending is, well, both too much and not enough.  I felt disappointed and a bit cheated, as if the author simply got bored with writing the book and simply decided to put an end to it. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a mostly enjoyable read that leads nowhere.	2005-08-13

He always spins a good story.  'The Terminal Man' fits his pattern very nicely.  Despite his computers-taking-over-the-world mindset, which was probably mainstream some thirty plus years ago when the book was written, Crichton does deliver on the suspense. <br /> <br />As for the story, we have medical science looking to treat violent epileptics (where the seizures induce violent attacks on others) by wiring their brains to a computer; the computer administers carefully controlled electrical shocks.  However their first patient proves be a bit of a deviant.  He manages to control his brain waves such that he becomes the master of the computer.  From there it gets ugly, and exciting.  Silly?  Yes, but not ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a science fiction thriller that has aged well.  Recommended.	2005-08-06

Much to my surprise, the novel 'The Red Pony' is actually a serialized story by John Steinbeck written over several years.  The discontinuity is very apparent since Steinbeck (re-)introduces the characters in each chapter.  Only in one of the stories we have a red pony, and it's a rather sad story.  Don't expect grandeous scenes of a boy riding a horse.  'The Red Pony' concentrates on the usual John Steinbeck theme: the hard life of peasant farmers in 1930s California.  He has done much better in 'The Grapes of Wrath', 'East of Eden', and 'The Pearl'. <br /> <br />Since the collection of stories comprising of 'The Red Pony' is still less than one hundred pages my book also contains a twenty page short-story by Steinbeck entitled 'Junius Maltby'.  Actually this story, about a father and son being impoverished and not realizing until others educate them of it, is nicely done ... very much on the calibre one expects from Steinbeck. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: certainly not among the better works of John Steinbeck.  Not recommended.	2005-07-31

I am pleased to say the author does an excellent job in capturing the essence of the alienation and bewilderment of Americans living in Japan.  He obviously did his research, or perhaps he has lived in Japan himself?  But otherwise I found 'Ransom' to be a bit disappointing.    In 'Ransom' we have a wandering American who decides to study karate in Kyoto while making some money teaching English in Osaka.  His associates at the dojo are quite bizarre or at least anti-social.  His family in the USA don't understand him.  His love life is non-existent.  And he finds himself embroiled in some rather nasty business that ultimately puts his life in danger.  While all this might sound intriguing I'm afraid the author didn't do a particularly good job in engaging this reader.  None of the characters are likable, especially the leading character (Chris Ransom).  Overall 'Ransom' felt unstructured and aimless.      Bottom line: perhaps best left to gaijins thinking of moving to Japan and those who've \\"been there, done that\\".	2005-07-27

'The Thirty-Nine Steps' would probably have faded into obscurity if it was for the success of Alfred Hitchcock's film adaptation.  It is a very short novel, barely a hundred pages.  Not enough space to beef up the prose or the characterizations.  John Buchan is clearly more of a storyteller than a writer.  But in 'The Thirty-Nine Steps' he does spin a nice little story. <br /> <br />The story is set in Britain just before the first WW I broke out.  A bachelor in London is confronted by a man 'with a secret', one involving spies and nationality security.  When the man is found murdered our bachelor is wrongfully suspected.  He flees to both escape the law and carry forward with the murdered man's mission, again involving national security.  The story takes us from Scotland to the English south coast.  Lots of uncanny coincidences make this story wholely unbelievable.  Yet I found myself reading through this near manic-paced story with great interest ... and almost childish enjoyment. <br /> <br />So this is an over-the-top story told with delicious urgency and zest.  Fans of Ian Fleming (..James Bond novels) will find 'The Thirty-Nine Steps' to be dated, tame (no sex, little violence), but otherwise enjoyable.	2005-07-23

Let me say that indeed the story has originality and touching moments but, in my opinion, it doesn't rise above average for mid-Victorian melodrama.  The prose is extremely long-winded, as if Dickens was paid by the word.  And the characterizations are either too endearing or too evil, .. very little in between.<br /><br />The story is complex.  Let's just say it involves people whose lives are affected and even jeopardized by the French Revolution.  Charles Dickens does a fine job in demonstrating the excesses of the old French aristocracy and the extreme anger of the impoverished.  Anger quickly turns into vengenance and a vigilante mentality.  It's this brutality and it's encroachment on the lives of good people which seem to comprise the moral of the story.  Oh, and there is a very weepy ending to the book involving extraordinary self-sacrifice.<br /><br />Bottom line: I found 'A Tale of Two Cities' to be an arduous read despite its distinct merits.  Recommend only to fans of the author.	2005-07-17

Most everyone in the English-speaking world has heard of 'Robinson Crusoe' and know roughly what the story is about (Englishman gets marooned on a island and runs into fellow castaway sidekick he calls Friday).  And upon reading the book there are no surprises.  It reads like a book written 300 years ago: it's language is a bit stiff, lots of preaching of Christianity and Christian values, absolutely no sex.  There is some violence but it is not belabored nor is it graphic. <br /> <br />However 'Robinson Crusoe' is not a deadly dull read.  Defoe's attention to detail on how Crusoe survives on the island is quite remarkable, and inventive.  His interaction with Friday and other folks (..at the end of the book) is also interesting.  Yet overall there is nothing here to enthrall the reader.  Noted as a book for young (teenaged) readers, I think 'Robinson Crusoe' would bore anyone but the most patient adult. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: certainly a classic and not devoid of merit, but overall I am unlikely to recommend this book.	2005-07-01

These guys live for the thrill and horror of killing vampires, and in-between they get drunk and act stupid.  The vampires themselves are truly monsterous and powerful.  Forget Bela Lugosi.   <br /> <br />While I found the characterizations of the vampire hunters to be a bit weak and very uninteresting, the portrayal of the vampires and the methods of battling them to be very well-written ... and fascinating.  The battle sequences are exciting, violent and unpredictable.  So I find myself trudging through the dull narrative about the vampire hunters' lives while anxiously awaiting the next battle sequence. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: forget about the vampire hunter soap opera and read the book for those terrific vampire-killing sequences.  Recommended.	2005-06-22

The prose, characterizations and dialogue are uniformly excellent in all his books I've read, including 'The Blue Afternoon'.  In this book we have, in effect, a romance between a doctor and a married woman ... plus a number of interesting side stories (murder, war, mayhem and yes, more romance).  The 1903 Manila setting, just after the Spanish-American war, gives the story a historical and fascinating twist. <br /> <br />Like his other books, 'The Blue Afternoon' isn't an entirely believable read.  But it is such a pleasurable story that one wishes it was all fact, not fiction.  My only complaint with it is the ending.  Some open-ended matters concerning subplots are not closed.  The author has seemingly done this purposely to tease the reader.  I wasn't teased, just annoyed.  However this doesn't tarnish the overall pleasure of reading 'The Blue Afternoon'. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a rich, charming fable.  Why it hasn't been made into a film is anyone's guess.  Recommended to all.	2005-06-12

Written in a gritty style, we have a crusty female cop investigating the apparent suicide of his boss's daughter.  Through this investigation, which is more of a soul-searching journey, we discover that our investigator has very insightful knowledge about the causes of suicide .. perhaps too much (yes, her own psyche gradually unravels).  So 'Night Train' is a psychological drama, not a mystery novel per se. <br /> <br />I should add that Martin Amis proves himself to be a fine writer with 'Night Train'.  The prose and characterizations are terrific.  However as pointed out by another amazon.com reviewer, the author should have kept this story based in Britain, the author's home turf, rather than some no-name place in America.  The author misses on some American nuances, and I caught one glaring usage of a British expletive.  Perhaps the book's editors are more to blame than the author. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: complex, depressing and well-written.  Recommended.	2005-06-08

Firstly, I have not seen the film adaptation of 'Single White Female' and so this review isn't tainted one way or the other.  This book, about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate, is written is very easy style.  Characterizations, prose, and dialogue are all straightforward.  I can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel.  And the book's \\"feel\\" is anything but original.  'Sliver' by Ira Levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life (and danger) in Manhattan for a single, white female.  Still, 'Single White Female' is an entertaining read. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a very enjoyable, suspenseful read that doesn't tax the brain.  Recommended.	2005-06-04

Ender's Game is certainly a curious and perhaps unique piece of science fiction.  Yes, it does have the requisite space travel and alien encounters.  However the main thrust of the book involves the preparation of warfare, specifically the toughening up of a young boy (Ender Wiggin) destined to save mankind.  So Ender's Game is much more a book for students of military tactics than fans of science fiction.  I am neither and so ... I'm either the best person to submit a book review, or the worst person! <br /> <br />As for the story, hmmm... it's a bit complicated.  Some time in the future Earth is threatened repeated by insect-like aliens, curiously referred to as 'buggers'.  After many years of searching a young boy is found who can be trained, at times in a most brutal fashion, to can lead mankind in victory over the enemy.  Lots of sometimes interesting, often boring battle simulations ensue.  And the promised \\"war of the worlds\\" comes towards the end of the book, ... and I admit it's a damn good ending. <br /> <br />Clearly the author deserves kudos on the military/battle elements of Ender's Game.  However I found a very basic premise of the book hard to swallow.  Ender Wiggin is chosen as the prospective chosen leader to save mankind when he was *six years old*.  However his actions and thoughts are clearly mature, as are those of his siblings (..who are also exceptionally gifted, and a bit strange).  I don't understand why the author chose the hero to be a young boy.  I can understand perhaps in several millenia children growing up faster but I'm afraid the author has distorted this notion all out of proportion.   <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: despite its flaws Ender's Game is a very interesting read.	2005-05-31

Like most Americans I read 'The Catcher in the Rye' back in high school because it was the thing to do.  I didn't care much for it then, and I forgot nearly all of it.  However upon re-reading it thirty years later I am surprised at what a concise, insightful and moving story it is.  Alternatively humorous and depressing, the book is reminiscent of 'The Great Gatsby' because it completely evokes an bygone era without a word wasted. <br /> <br />As for the story, it's about a tuned-out, turned off teenager escaping from a boarding school in the 1940s.  The young man runs off to New York to try to make some sense of his life and make amends with his family, especially his younger sister.  No, nothing terribly exciting happens in these several days.  But the author really makes the reader feel compassion and pity for the fellow.  We're not exactly sure why he's so disillusioned with life but we desperately want him to \\"change the channel\\" on his depression and despair. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: quietly disturbing and moving.  Kids: don't bother reading this book.  Instead tell your parents to read it .. again!	2005-05-23

'Search The Sky' by Kornbluth and Pohl was written in the early 1950s and it clearly hasn't aged well.  The story lacks any sort of credibility from a variety of angles ... readers would have surely caught these fifty years ago.  However the story does have some very intriguing elements.  So one can say this science fiction novel has some great fiction but bad science. <br /> <br />As for the story, spin forward several millenia into the future and we find several planets in distant galaxies inhabited by humans.  For some unknown reason interplanetary communication/trade died out generations ago.  However along comes an ancient ship carrying people with a curious, undecipherable message.  This ship is the used to transport a trader/explorer to these other planets to see what has happened.  The results are unexpected, .. and I'd rather not disclose spoilers.  But Kornbluth/Pohl make some interesting observations about human nature and genetics.  Believable?  No, but certainly thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a creative story line and insightful observations of mankind save this from being an amateurish, outdated SF novel.	2005-05-20

'Playback is a rather prosaic effort by Raymond Chandler, which is disappointing to anyone who has enjoyed his other great works starring the enigmatic private eye Philip Marlowe.  The prose doesn't crackle like his earlier works, and the 'modernization' of Philipe Marlowe (he actually has sex with his femme fatales) is distressing. <br /> <br />Now as for the story, we have Marlowe hired by some mysterious individuals to shadow a gorgeous woman for some unclear reason.  Lots of running around San Diego County, some violence, but the overall effect of the story is one of randomness.  A painless yet forgettable read. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: really not worth the bother.	2005-05-11

'A Separate Peace' was a very popular book during the 1960s/1970s.  Its WW II theme evidently translated well to the Vietnam War.  However now a generation on I have to wonder what the fuss was all about.  Much of the book reads like a stage play; lots of dialogue in a relative close setting (a private boys school in New Hampshire).  Unfortunately the prose fails to ignite.  I simply didn't feel the angst and frustration of the leading characters.<br /><br />I also felt the book was strangely ... gay.  Here we have a book about a boys school where the subject of girls doesn't come up even once.  And the 'bonding' between the two main characters seem to perhaps transcend wholesome friendship.  I have no idea if this gay subtext was intended by the author, .. perhaps not.  But clearly the strange behavior of the leading characters is caused by something other than their impending call to active service.  Homosexuality in a homophobic environment is a plausible answer.<br /><br />Bottom line: a rather overly intense and verbose drama that loses steam quickly.  Not recommended.	2005-05-01

I am amazed at the largely negative reviews of this book.  While I will acknowledge Carson McCullers hadn't consistently produced fine literature, 'The Member of the Wedding' has to be considered one of her best.  In short it chronicles the summer of a twelve year old girl growing up in the American South during WW II.  She has reached the age where she doesn't quite fit into this world.  Her emotions reach the boiling point as the day of her brother's wedding nears.  ...at that's about it.  Sound dull?  Anything but. <br /> <br />What really makes this book special are the characterizations and the extremely rich prose.  Very few modern writers can produce such eloquent and simple prose, ... perhaps Margaret Atwood comes close.  I found myself feeling such empathy for our leading character, ... and I'm a middle-aged man.  So don't think this is a book for little girls.  Its appeal trancends both age and gender. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: simply wonderful.  Read it NOW!	2005-04-29

'The Black House' contains several short stories which are a slight departure from Patricia Highsmith's normal stomping ground - namely, psychotics and murderers.  These stories have a somewhat of mild surreal, psychological angle to them.  Daily routine life on the exterior becomes distorted when closely examined ... er, or something like that.  There is no common underlying theme to the story. They seem to be written over a period of years, published for various periodicals.  The publisher decided to, thankfully, give these stories an second life by reissuing them in this book. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: enjoyable, disturbing stories for fans of Patricia Highsmith ... and those not acquainted with her works.	2005-04-23

The writing duo of Sjowall/Wahloo produced some curious crime novels in their relatively brief joint collaboration (until Wahloo's death).  The Swedish authors always portray 1960s Stockholm as some completely abysmal, neurotic city barely rising above total anarchy.  They also view the Swedish government with distain.  Such social commentary about a gorgeous yet flawed place like Stockhom is very curious indeed, especially when sprinkled in police crime novels.  But beyond this in 'The Laughing Policeman' the writers have crafted a tight murder mystery that has just enough plot twists and weird characters to keep the reader hooked without thinking it being all too contrived. <br /> <br />In 'The Laughing Policeman' we have the Stockholm police dept investigating a horrific mass murder on a municipal bus.  Among the victims is a police detective who is seemingly doing some extra duty on the side.  The story unravels slowly and cleverly.    Yes there is some violence, drugs and sex.  But the story is comparatively tame by modern standards.  I found it all very entertaining. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a crime story that is well-written, somewhat quirky, and very believable.

However 'The Crow Road', perhaps one of the author's more conventional novels, is not amongst his best efforts.  Of course it is well-written with fine characterizations.  But the story has the feel of a television mini-series.  A good mini-series, mind you.  Yet as a result for this reader the book is relegated to \\"fine but forgettable\\" category. <br /> <br />Now for story, we are introduced to the travails of a young Scottish teenager and his extended family.  The book chronicles the lives of his parents and their siblings as well has the present generation.  Lots of sibling rivalries, love and friendship, birth and death.  It's all very well drawn; the author certainly didn't make it up as he went along.  But the drama Banks was looking to gain towards the end of the story (..no spoilers here) was a bit over-cooked, like a daytime soap opera.  Ultimately he proved to be a bit over-ambitious. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: not quite the sweeping family saga like 'East of Eden' or 'Sometimes a Great Notion'.  But the author's talents certainly show through.	2005-04-15

'Bimbos of the Death Sun' is a delightful comedic murder mystery with a twist: the crime occurs at a science fiction/fantasy convention.  Sprinkle in an assortment of strange, mega-geeky individuals and you have a rather enjoyable reading experience.  It's all very tongue-in-cheek but the author seems to view these obsessed individuals with compassion, not distain. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: books with silly titles are often silly.  This book is no exception but it is still recommended.	2005-04-06

'Running with Scissors' is an incredible story of a simply dreadful childhood of its author Augusten Burroughs.  Quite simply, it shows how a child's life can be mangled about by adults who are insane and unintentionally cruel (psychologically, not physically).  But the story is also remarkable due to the author's survival through such chaos and moral depravity. <br /> <br />Most autographies have a tendency to be poorly written, unbalanced, and ultimately disappointing reads.  'Running with Scissors' is a wonderful exception due the author's self-deprecating humor and clearly superior writing skills.  I look forward to reading the sequel ('Dry'). <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a harrowing story of a childhood from hell that somehow inspires without being preachy.  Strongly recommended.	2005-03-29

Firstly, much of the setting is well outside greater Boston - specially, Tampa Bay.  And the protagonists are a mega-wealthy father-daughter duo who are decidedly not what they appear to be.  No gangland thugs, very little drug use, no scenes poverty and urban decay.  Does this departure for Lehane do him justice?  Er, mostly no.  But it is still a good read. <br /> <br />Without divulging the story, in 'Sacred' we have a couple of lovey-dovey yet hardcore private eyes who are hired by a gravely ill billionaire to find his daughter.  And off they go to Florida  to find the beauty.  However the detectives find themselves embroilled in a family situation even Jerry Springer would find offensive.  Violence, greed, and a whole lotta nastiness follows.  As always Lehane comes up with rich dialogue and great characterizations.  I suppose my biggest complaint with the book is the very ending, especially after some very clever twists mid-stream. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: certainly recommended, especially for Lehane fans.	2005-03-24

I decided to give the book a try having just read (and enjoyed) the author's other classic 'The Time Machine'.  '20,000 Leagues...' is a far more ambitious novel and, overall, even more enjoyable.<br /><br />The story is set in the late 1860s when the book was written.  Due to unusual circumstance (..no spoilers here) three men (a naturalist, his manservant, and a whaler) are taken against their will onto a (then unheard of) submarine by the enigmatic Captain Nemo.  For many months they circumnavigate the globe and cross all the oceans.  Along the way the encounter the fantastic, some dramatic episodes, and even fleeting moments of comedy.  The author goes into great detail of describing the wonders of the submarine.  While of course much of the science he describes is a bit silly most of it is remarkably true to life.  I am especially amazed at his foresight into electricity years before the lightbulb was invented.  Monsieur Verne was truly a genius.  And thankfully, he was a pretty good writer.<br /><br />But this book doesn't hit all the right notes.  All the in-depth descriptions of amazing underwater flora and fauna gets rather repetitive.  The middle third of the book is a bit of a tedious read.  Thankfully the story tightens considerably towards the end, with a very surprising climax.<br /><br />Bottom line: an often overlooked classic that will probably bore younger readers but will enthrall adults.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-19

'The Glass Key' is one of Dashiell Hammett's more controlled, accessible mysteries.  The number of characters involved is limited, and the characterizations are uniformly excellent.  The story, about political corruption and murder, is something like Hammett's earlier 'Red Harvest'.  But 'Red Harvest' was a bit excessive in scope and as a result its plot became somewhat undecipherable after a while.  Fortunately 'The Glass Key' doesn't degrade in that way ... in fact it gets better as the story progresses (complete with a good surprise ending). <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a measured, competent effort by Dashiell Hammett.  Not among his more famous works but certainly among the better.	2005-03-09

'A Drink Before the War' is the first of several crime novels by Dennis Lehane involving two young Boston private investigators, Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro.  As will all Lehane novels the writing is uniformly good, the characterizations believable, and the dialogue sharp.  However 'A Drink Before the War', a story about gang warfare and corrupt politicians, is somewhat preachy in tone.  I found all the overt rascism to be a bit over-dramatized, the anti-rascism rhetoric to be tiresome.  In between Lehane throws in plenty of violence and ugliness.  While certainly a competent read it was gratuitously nasty.  In the end I felt bad for being a white American, ... was that the point of the book?<br /><br />Bottom line: good, but too much of hate-fest.  For Lehane fans only.	2005-03-02

Okay, I admit I am one of the few humans on the planet who has yet to see the film adaptation of 'The Maltese Falcon'.  But upon reading the book I can now see why the film would be a classic.  The story is tight, the characters are twisted and heartless, and the dialogue is extremely sharp.  As with the author's other books 'The Maltese Falcon' is ruined slightly by the author overcooking the plot towards the end.  But only slightly. <br /> <br />Explaining the story would be quite challenging.  Essentially we have a mysterious beauty hiring a private eye under false pretenses which results in the murder of his partner.  Quite quickly we understand this beauty is no angel, and along with her is a wild bunch of misfits looking to get their hands on a priceless figurine ('the Maltese falcon').  Naturally more murders follow, complete with some clever and somewhat confusing double-crossings.  Believable?  ...er, no. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: deliciously nasty and a bit over-the-top.  A must read.	2005-02-26

Carl Hiaasen is the master of the trade, Randy Wayne White is a mere wannabe ... judging by this book.  Oh, 'Shark River' is a pleasant read; the pages just float on by.  But the author seemed to be wrapped up in describing southwest Florida's flora and fauna than providing the reader with a decent mystery.  And so this book will be quickly forgotten by this reader. <br /> <br />As for the story, well we have Doc Ford once again fighting off nasty drug dealers.  He also discovered he has a sister/cousin, a rowdy Bahamian woman who creates both attention and trouble.  Throw in some wacky characters and a little treasure-hunting and you have ... again, a pleasant yet forgettable read. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: probably not worth the bother.  Try any of Carl Hiaasen's books instead.	2005-02-21

I bought 'Zombies of the Gene Pool' at a charity shop because, well, how can one pass up a book with such a cool title?!?  Then I saw the amazon.com reviews and worried I wasted what little money I spent on the book.  But ... surprise!  The book was actually a pretty decent read. <br /> <br />The story is about a bunch of sixty year old former science fiction afficionados returning back to their former stomping ground in eastern Tennessee.  They are returning to retrieve a buried time capsule in which they stuffed some literary assets.  Yes, there is a bit of a mystery swizzled in towards the end of the book.  It doesn't add much to the story.  But the author does an excellent job on capturing the feel of those quirky individuals completely absorbed in science fiction writing and publish articles in fan magazines.  Very well-observed and endearing. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a book that should be read by science fiction geeks, not those in search of a good mystery.  Recommended.	2005-02-11

As the other amazon.com reviewers have glowingly commented, 'The Curious Incident...' is really a unique reading experience.  Any book which is written in the first person, narrated by a teenager, a teenager with autism no less, has to be considered special.  Fortunately the author treats this young man and his long-suffering parents with dignity.  It never degrades to a tear-jerker, nor does the author resort to sterotypes. <br /> <br />As for the story, well ... the title says it all.  It is simply about a very bizarre incident in the life of this autistic young man and how he responds to it.  It's equally humorous, sad and touching. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: the sort of book you'd loan to your friends.	2005-02-06

Written in 1895, 'The Time Machine' has a very dated, musty aspect to it.  It's naive and far from realistic.  But even if one discounts the over-simplicity of the story it is hard not to get caught into the strange, distant future world (greater London to be exact) created by H. G. Wells.  His vision has been copied and arguably improved upon over the past century.  However even now the story enthralls.  And the compactness of the narrative, in a book scarcely over 100 pages, is remarkable.<br /><br />Bottom line: yes, it is the sort of science fiction of your great-grandfather's generation.  Thankfully it is still worth reading.	2005-02-05

Without a doubt it is the most outrageous, tawdry, over-the-top haunted house story ever conceived.  It is so utterly preposterous that one wonders if Richard Matheson wrote it as a farce/satire or as serious literature?  I have to think the former since the author has written truly compelling horror stories before, such as 'I am Legend'.  'Hell House' is the polar opposite of that horror classic. <br /> <br />Yet still, 'Hell House' is compulsively readable.  All the characters are deliciously strange or outright neurotic, the ghosts are all perverts, lesbianism pops up at the most unexpected times, and female nudity abounds.  Again I didn't say all this makes any sense.   <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: definitely falls into the \\"so bad that it's good\\" category.	2005-02-04

In now the 9th of her Crime Files series it has become clear Ann Rule has run out of interesting crime cases to report on, or she is simply going through the motions on some modestly interesting cases with lots of dust on them (most were over thirty years old).  I bought this book at the airport right before boarding a transatlantic flight, as a last minute purchase.  At least it was very readable, in Ann Rule's somewhat folksy way.  But having finished the book a couple of days ago I cannot remember any of the true crime stories it contains.  This doesn't speak well for the book(, nor for me?). <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: utter true crime fodder.  Ann Rule has done much, much better.	2005-01-28

'Red Harvest' starts off so well, much like a Raymond Chandler novel.  A man is murdered under strange circumstances, with his intriguingly strange family members being either suspects or wanting revenge.  In waltzes a private investigator, ala Philip Marlowe, who seems tough, street-wise, and does well with the ladies.  Oh, and the lingo throughout is very 1930s tough guy talk.  However 'Red Harvest' ultimately sinks into mediocrity.  Why? <br /> <br />Firstly, Dashiell Hammett spins an overly complex story with way too many characters ... into what is a very short book.  Too many killings, too much action, very little coherence.  While the story sort of pulls itself together in the end I find myself ultimately bored, and disappointed, with the entire effort. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line:  not an enjoyable reading experience.	2005-01-22

It deftly chronicles life in 1890s New York City whilst several characters, with guest appearances from the then police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt, track down a psychotic killer/cannibal.  Caleb Carr truly succeeds in capturing the feel of a bygone New York; I found it to be wonderful escapism.  However the murder mystery itself, while often very clever and unpredictable, stretches credibility - the author overcooked it a bit. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a well-written mystery for fans of old New York.  Recommended.	2005-01-17

The first book was good, the second book not so good, the third book was very good, and the fourth book was the least good.  The fifth book, 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\", is enormous - nearly 900 pages (in hardback).  It has taken me over two weeks to finish.  Thankfully, this book clearly outclasses all the other Harry Potter books - full kudos to the author. <br /> <br />In this latest Harry Potter installment we have intriguing, and often hilarious, political in-fighting at Hogwarts (the wizardry school).  Almost everyone seems to be out to get poor Harry.  Harry's near love life is going south.  The plot percolates nicely, with various twists and turns.  The characterizations of the many secondary characters are uniformly excellent.  The story is thrilling, sad, and hilarious in equal measures.  However I would say with 'Phoenix' the Harry Potter series no longer for people under, say, fifteen years of age.  Or at least much of the drama and subtext will be lost to younger readers, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: I am once again a Harry Potter groupie!	2005-01-08

'Bad Boy' by Jim Thompson is essentially his autobiography, detailing his life up until about age twenty.  He had a horrible, crazy life.  The reader is paraded through his dozens of menial jobs, illegal hijinx, and nasty episodes with classmates and his family.  While the early part of 'Bad Boy' is indeed interesting when we don't realize the narrator is Jim Thompson himself.  However soon the author gets a bit self-indulgent in describing his wasted youth.  I found myself more annoyed with young Thompson than feeling any pity. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom life: Jim Thompson had an absolutely rotten childhood.  Do you really want to know the details??	2004-12-18

Apparently loosely based on a real person, it is about an aging aristocrat in Victorian England who slowly progresses/regresses from being an eccentric (likes to build many tunnels under his massive estate) to a real cuckoo (becomes delusional, and begins to engage into nasty mischief).  And he seems to be obsessed with his (real? imagined?) failing health.  His staff, while seeming unerringly loyal, struggle to keep up with him.   <br /> <br />While all this might sound a bit dull, the book is salvaged by some very sweet and compassionate writing.  The dottering old coot is all alone and sad.  The reader cannot help but care for him, much like his close servants.  I was hoping that someone would come and offer true comfort to the old man.  I will let future readers discover as to whether this actually happens. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a sweet, sad story of aging and loneliness.  Depressing?  No.  Recommended?  Yes.	2004-12-15

'America...' by the writers of The Daily Show is one very clever piece of writing, packaging and marketing.  It contains slices of American government, political and judicial processes in both distorted and painfully correct perspectives which are often hilarious, sometimes insulting, and perhaps excessively crude (vulgar).  It is very well designed, complete with brilliant pictures and illustrations.  And its (large) school textbook format, which earns kudos for originality, makes it a perfect coffee table book for those who are proudly 'politically incorrect'.   <br /> <br />Now I am sure many folks will be reluctant to buy this book because The Daily Show is known for being a bit left wing, and there is some controversy surrounding Wal*Mart's decision not to sell it.  This is most unfortunate.  The book is only slightly skewed to the left; its insults are slattered across the board.  And the offending nudity, limited to one page, is comical and not vulgar.  However this book contains a lot of foul language, often crude and juvenile.  I can see where some folks will find this tiresome if not down right offensive. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: delightfully insulting to everyone.  Strongly recommended.	2004-12-15

Even after the opening few lines one senses 'The Nothing Man' is very much all-Thompson: desperate characters, lots of boozing, crackling dialogue, and a wee bit of murder.  The chemistry is all there yet, for this reader, the story just didn't ignite ... despite the anticipation that any moment it would. <br /> <br />In our story we have junior hack working at a local newspaper who is really in bad shape.  He's a boozer.  His estranged wife is a tramp.  And his mind is really twisted evidently because his, ahem, 'male member' got blown off by a landmine during the war.  Very quickly he loses what little sanity he has and, in a \\"I can get away with anything\\" fashion, goes on a rampage.  Enough said, but I will add that Jim Thompson has also thrown in a curious surprise in the final pages. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: vintage Jim Thompson without the extra bite and cleverness of his better works.	2004-12-08

The King's General is a product of Daphne Du Maurier's love of her native Cornwall, English history, and her superior writing capabilities.  She does an excellent job of capturing the feel of 17th century Cornwall in the midst of England's civil war.  Even someone like myself with no interest in this particular subject matter found it all to be very readable.<br /><br />I suppose my only quibble with The King's General has to do with its too many melodramatic episodes.  The main element of the story involves two Cornwall families with interwoven romances, feuds, and family traumas.  While certainly some of the romantic scenes are, well, romantic.  But just as often the scenes seem almost comically contrived.  Lots of male and female egos going amuck.  At times The King's General felt like a gothic romance novel, ... which probably isn't what the author intended.<br /><br />Bottom line: despite some over-the-top scenes The King's General is a very worthy read.	2004-12-04

And folks are nasty, gossipy, and simply use each other for their own pitiful gains.  But of course 'The Kill-Off' also contains the key hallmark of a Thompson novel - murder. <br /> <br />In 'The Kill-Off' we have some anonymous town with several interwoven lives becoming unstiched by malicious gossip being spread by a depressed, home-bound housewife.  As the story unfolds, as told from different characters' perspectives, we slowly begin to understand what's going on and a sense of doom (murder) builds nicely.  Yes, there is a murder but the reader doesn't know the perpetrator until the very end.  Jim Thompson does an excellent job with the characterizations, and the story is cleverly structured.  However 'The Kill-Off' does not rank about the author's classics; it is merely very good (for him, excellent for most everyone else). <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a must read for Jim Thompson fans	2004-11-26

'Aurora Dawn' is a light, almost whimsical story about some shenanigans between a radio broadcasting network, an advertiser (Aurora Dawn, makers of soap products), and an evangelical preacher with a successful (live) radio program.  We have a young network employee who tries to balance the interests and misbehavior of all these entities, plus somehow sort out his confused love life.  The book was written over fifty years ago and feels rather dated, with the surprising exception of the barnstorming preacher character. <br /> <br />While in many ways a perfectly adequate read, and is certainly a very good first book by the wonderful Herman Wouk, its satire lacks bite and its humor is rather weak.  I suppose what really annoyed me was the structure of 'Aurora Dawn'.  Its story is actually narrated by a pompous radio announcer-type of narrator.  Cute for the first fifty pages, grating thereafter. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: certainly a book that would not have been reprinted if it weren't for the author's latter works and subsequent reputation.  Very missable.	2004-11-22

It is a very serious, meticulous examination of a young woman plagued with multiple personalities.  The author does a stellar job in telling this story from the perspectives of key individuals: the woman herself, her spinster aunt (with whom she lives), and her psychiatrist.  The narrative is taut, the characterizations are fully developed. <br /> <br />However despite all this glowing praise the book lacks ... compassion.  There is a complete lack of warmth in all the characters, and I found the psychiatrist to surprisingly cold and the only character lacking in believability; he seemed like someone pulled out of a Charles Dickens novel.  Unfortunately the coldness of the characters bled off on to this reader, and towards the end of \\"The Bird's Nest\\" I began to lose interest in the plight of our poor suffering leading character. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: competent, serious and well written.  But perhaps a bit too antiseptic for my taste.	2004-11-15

He wanders through the drug stage, the meaningless sex stage, and forever has bouts of \\"soul searching\\".  But unfortunately this reader found him to be so unappealing that I gradually became disinterested in him altogether.  The rather choppy literary style of Kosinski, an unfortunate departure from his terrific 'Being There', only made matters worse. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a rather burdensome and unenjoyable read.	2004-11-10

'Stowaway to Mars' is an early work of John ('Day of the Triffids') Wyndham, written way back in the 1930s.  The book was obviously a dud when it was first published since it was not released in the USA until the 1970s after John Wyndham finally found some success.  And the book has not been reprinted in the USA since then either.  So I was hoping this lack of attention was unfair and I had bumped into a hidden gem when I found this book at a used bookstore.  Wrong.  Very wrong. <br /> <br />Well as you can guess from the title, this book is about an adventure to Mars where a female stowaway \\"with a secret\\" creates a bit of havoc amongst the all-male crew.  While the technology aspects of the story are incredibly dated I found the build up of sending the rocket to Mars to be rather entertaining.  However the story degrades rather quickly when they actually land on Mars.  The author fails to develop the situation, with the result being a very amateurish effort at describing Martian terrain and life.  I was just glad the pain didn't last long since the book is very short. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a rather poor read I'm afraid.  John Wyndham wrote much better stuff later in his career.	2004-11-09

While many of the stories are not terribly well-written I found them all to be imaginative, often with surprise endings.  As a bonus the book comes with a preface before each story comparing it with its film counterpart, comments about the author and the production of the film.  I also enjoyed the pictures of these films scattered through the book. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a recommended read for everyone.	2004-11-07

'The Woman in the Dunes' is my first Kobo Abe novel, and it is allegedly one his most accessible (read: least weird) novels.  While the book is well written (kudos to the translator) it certainly has an unusual if not bizarre story.  I am somewhat surprised at the glowing praises of the amazon.com reviewers. <br /> <br />As for the story, it is about the enslavement of a young man by villagers residing literally in the dunes of a remote corner of Japan.  He becomes the worker bee and companion of a widow whose house is literally enveloped by huge sand dunes. The young man develops a relationship of sorts with the woman, tries hard to escape from his imprisonment, and copes with the daily hardships of living in a sandpit. ... and that's about it.  Yes, there are some interesting moments from a human interaction perspective.  And Kobo Abe keeps the story compelling, although I'm not sure how.  It certainly isn't a book I'll forget anytime soon. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: clearly a surreal story worthy of being considered a classic.  Big points on originality but the entire reading experience leaves a somewhat bad (sandy?) aftertaste.	2004-10-30

'The Secret People' was written in the 1930s, back in the days of Buck Rogers stories.  It has a certain charm and innocence compared to the more complex (and lengthy) modern science fiction novels.  Its author, John Wyndham, had written some wonderful pieces some twenty years later.  However 'The Secret People', while entertaining, is not of the same calibre. <br /> <br />In our story we have the Earth some 30 years in the future.  The French and British governments decide to harvest the Sahara desert by flooding it, creating \\"the New Sea\\".  Yet we discover that underneath the desert floor exists a huge colony of 'secret people', ... actually ancient pygmies.  A dashing British couple unfortunately find themselves underground and held as prisoners by these people, in addition to hundreds of other prisoners.  Of course the flooding of the desert and the yearning to escape unsettles matters.... <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a simple, naive and fun little book.  John Wyndham fans will enjoy it.	2004-10-25

After reading Jonathan Franzen's dreadful 'The Twenty-Seventh City' I picked up his 'The Corrections' with much hesitation (well, it was only $2 at a charity shop ;-)).  Much to my delight, 'The Corrections' is a very well-written novel. <br /> <br />Other amazon.com reviewers panned this book as being a boring soap opera.  Okay, this family saga is a bit soap opera-ish but the characterizations are very interesting, and the main theme (how a family deals with a patriarch suffering from dementia) is very well handled.  The author is compassionate and hopeful while also being realistic.  My only quibbles with 'The Corrections' are its length (a bit too long), and the author sometimes gets a bit sidetracked on matters not related to the main story.  But otherwise I was very impressed with Jonathan Franzen's ability to successfully tackle a very complex, dramatic story. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a somewhat overly long but expertly handled dramatic novel.  Recommended.	2004-10-22

As most folks probably recall, 'Being There' was a Peter Sellers film some twenty years ago with the memorable line \\"I like to watch\\".  The film was well done, both funny and sad in equal measures.  Most folks probably don't realize the film was based on book by the late Jerzy Kosinski, written some ten years earlier.  I decided to see how the book compares with the film.  I'm delighted to say it fairs very well indeed. <br /> <br />'Being There' is a short novel about an illiterate, dim-witted man who had done literally nothing in life but garden.  During his life he has engaged in limited social intercourse, and none of the other sort of intercourse.  But his life completely changes when his guardian dies.  Thrust into the world, the rich and beautiful people he meet view him as deep thinker ... interpreting his gardening statements as profound metaphores.  He becomes an overnight sensation.   <br /> <br />Taken as a story by itself 'Being There' is just ordinary.  The prose is adequate as are the characterizations.  But 'Being There' is a scathing satire on how the most undeserving become stars in America.  Clearly one can become a celeb without an ounce of intelligence or talent. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: if you enjoyed the film you'll really enjoy the book.	2004-10-09

Clearly Sinclair Lewis was making a statement about the times, and no doubt he was chastized for being so brazen and, perhaps, seemingly \\"un-American\\".  So he deserves kudos for bravery.  Unfortunately much of the book is unreadable, being nothing more than hysterical rants.<br /><br />However one cannot help but wonder whether such anarchy come to America?  Of course the answer is 'yes'.  So on that note the book should be read.  Or better still, I hope someone updates it, smoothes it out, and makes a film adaptation.<br /><br />Bottom line: an important socio-political statement of 1930s America which is still valid in the 21st century.  Too bad it's not well-written.	2004-10-09

'Wolfbane' is a mess of a story, which is extremely disappointing since the authors (Kornbluth and Pohl) have produced one of best science fiction novels ever - 'The Space Merchants'.  'Wolfbane' fails from so many perspectives: completely implausible story, very inconsistent (and often horrible) writing, and characterizations which are weak.  I am being generous by judging this book as two stars. <br /> <br />As for the story, we have our beloved planet in turmoil two hundred years after some alien influence kills off the sun and replaces it with a \\"mini-sun\\" which burns out ever five years.  Most of mankind has died off.  All the remaining folks are weak, reticent drones ... with the exception of a few free individuals called wolves.  This tenuous co-existence falls apart when the alien influence flexes its muscle, and we have wolves to the rescue!  .... yes, the book is THAT bad.  Yet the first third of the book does lay out this strange world fairly nicely.  Too bad it spirals out of control very fast. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: pretty awful.  Best avoided.	2004-10-09

'Hard-Boiled', an anthology of twentieth-century \\"hard-boiled\\" short stories compiled by Pronzini and Adrian, should have been great.  Unfortunately out of the thousands of stories to choose from they picked the dregs from some of the best writers (Ellroy, Goodis, Thompson, ..), and the best from a great many (deservedly) unknown writers.  It took me a long time to slog through the dozens of stories contained in this volume. <br /> <br />However the only positve aspect of the book are the commentaries before each story, giving a bit of background on each author and their placement in the history of 'hard-boiled' short fiction.  Clearly Pronzini/Adrian have done their homework in this regard.  But this only made me more frustrated with the all the mediocre stories they amassed. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a missed opportunity.  Very disappointing.	2004-09-29

'The Shrinking Man' by Richard Matheson was written in the mid 1950s, spawning numerous film adaptations over the years.  Its success is no doubt due to its very original premise: a husband and father finds himself shrinking proportionally, eventually encountering some rather horrific situations (..including one nasty spider).  It's a compact, well-written story. <br /> <br />However unlike Matheson's best work, 'I Am Legend', 'The Shrinking Man' doesn't quite challenge the brain.  Nor is it truly frightening.  And the author seems to spend perhaps a bit too much time on the main subject's insatiable libido despite shrinking down to nothingness.  So while 'The Shrinking Man' is fully entertaining I wouldn't place it among the best in its genre. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: imperfect, but certainly a creative piece in horror fiction.  Recommended.	2004-09-25

The main novel deserves all the accolades by the other amazon.com reviewers; it is a truly original, ghoulish apocalyptic tale where vampires take over the world.  It is tightly written and completely enthralling.<br /><br />Unfortunately the collection of short stories generally tarnishes the overall package.  I found them either barely interesting or down right amateurish ... hard to believe they were written by the same person who wrote 'I Am Legend'.  However there is one very notable exception - the short story 'Prey'.  It's about a tribal figurine who unmercifully attacks a young woman in her New York apartment.  Terrific.<br /><br />Bottom line: certainly a mixed collection, but the main story 'I Am Legend' is an absolute must read.	2004-09-23

'Phantom Lady' by Cornell Woolrich (as William Irish) is an extremely enjoyable pulp fiction read.  While the author is known for his storytelling abilities rather than literay skills (prose/characterizations), and he has written plenty of shoddy and ridiculous stuff, 'Phantom Lady' is a classic page-turner.  I personally rate this on par with his excellent 'Waltz Into Darkness' as his best (..or at least among the dozen Woolrich novels I've read, plus many more short stories).<br /><br />In 'Phantom Lady' we have a man wrongly accused of murder (of his wife) sitting on death row.  The only person who can verify his alibi is a nameless and non-descript woman he shared an otherwise forgettable evening with.  As the clock ticks towards his final hour we are entertained with a mad chase to find this woman.  Believable?  Let's just say it's all barely plausible, which was enough to keep this reader thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />Bottom line: a real treat for Woolrich fans.  A must read.	2004-09-19

It's a very personal, perhaps autobiographical?, account of a young woman who completely loses touch with reality as she endures loneliness and alienation as a freshman in college.  Other than having emotionally deficient parents the cause of her despair and madness is not clear.  And so despite being well-written and evoking a strong sense of intimacy Ms Jackson left this reader somewhat bewildered and non-plussed with 'Hangsaman'. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a strange yet unaffecting piece by the horror master.  For loyal Jackson fans only.	2004-09-17

'We Have Always Lived in the Castle' has the classic hallmarks of a Shirley Jackson novel - gothic weirdness, and exposure of unflattering underbelly of human/societal behavior.  And the book is delightfully compact.  Excellent prose and characterizations make for a very enjoyable read of less than two hundred pages. <br /> <br />The story?  We have a rather imaginative (..to a disturbed extent) teenaged girl living with her older sister and invalid uncle in her \\"castle\\", a large estate home.  Several years earlier the rest of their family were poisoned at the dinner table, with the older sister being the accused.  Most of the neighbors view this family with extreme distain, encouraging a reclusive existence of the two young women.  However this fragile ecosystem becomes unbalanced when a cousin arrives at the door. ... and that's about all I should say.  The ending is very unexpected, and we learn a bit more about human behavior when the neighbors become restless. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a highly recommended story.  Not scary, but a very well-observed look at a twisted family and the 'kindness' of neighbors.	2004-09-06

'The Haunting of Hill House' is a compact jewel of a gothic novel, combining both classic horror with a psychological examination of one very troubled ghost hunter.  It indeed is the perfect sort of read for a rainy evening (I read it in one sitting, during Hurricane Frances). <br /> <br />In our story we have a suitably creepy, enormous house with a history of strange happenings.  An experience paranormal investigator hires a couple of young ladies to join him in staying at this house for a summer (..no 'hanky panky' intended, and nothing of the sort happened).  Yes, some very disturbing events occured during this period.  But perhaps more interesting is the gradual demise of one of the ladies who we discover has some personal issues.  No spoilers, but the ending is both surprising and appropriately ambiguous ... Shirley Jackson leaves the reader with some unanswered questions, to be answered by the reader's imagination. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: the usual Shirley Jackson competence swirled into a fun if somewhat old-fashioned haunted house story.  A very worthwhile read.	2004-09-04

Judging by its plot, a complicated and over-blown private eye adventure, this book is at best average.  But despite this 'The Last Good Kiss' is a rather memorable (if insignificant) piece of hard-boiled fiction.  Why?  Well... <br /> <br />Firstly, the book just oozes with 1970s ambiance.  Yes, everyone is drunk and over-sexed.  Lots of driving around with no concern of fuel economy.  The language and 'attitude' of the times are captured perfectly.  This is due in no small part to the deceptively effortless prose.  It's all very literate without feeling like (stuffy) literature. <br /> <br />Secondly, 'The Last Good Kiss' has some of the most strange and perverse characters imaginable.  They seem like refugees from some bad early 1970s movie.  Yet, somehow, they sustain the reader's interest long after the plot has fizzled out (..about halfway through). <br /> <br />A few words on the plot?  Let's see.  Private eye hired by attractive woman to find no good ex-husband.  Private eye then joins ex-husband to find missing daughter of a barmaid.  Jump to vignettes involving porno, drugs, sex/sex/sex and some violence, and that's about it.  Of course it seems everyone falls in love with our private eye ... go figure. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: ridiculous story more than salvaged by memorable characters and 1970s nostalgia.	2004-08-31

The prose and characterizations are uniformly excellent.  By stealth she decomposes the boredom, loneliness, and suffocating nature of American suburban life.  No, this doesn't contain any of the gothic horror goodies found in her later works.  And the ending seems a bit disjointed from the overall story.  Yet written over fifty years ago, \\"Road Through the Wall\\" seems anything but dated. <br /> <br />For a bit more about the story, it is actually a pastiche of daily events surrounding one neighborhood ... specifically one street.  The dialogue and behavior of the children are realistically cruel.  The parents are portrayed as being status seekers and gossip-mongers.  Their insular world is shattered, symbolically and literally, when a new road is built which barrels through their enclave. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a subtle and deceptively intricate novel.  Recommended.	2004-08-22

'The End of The Dream' is another installment of Ann Rule's Crime Files, and it happens to be the final in the series for me ... I've read them all.  Unfortunately this one is decidedly average.  The main story is about a young man, evidently an attractive man (as Ann Rule points out on every page or so), who seems to have a magnetic personality.  Unfortunately this personable chap clearly has some character deficiencies which ultimately drives him, and his friends who he sucks in, into robbing banks.  Of course fate catches up with him and ... well, you can imagine.  Oh, I should add the book has a couple of other stories in the end which amount to little more than true crime fodder.  Very forgettable stuff. <br /> <br />I suppose Ann Rule was drawn in the psychological element of our daring studpuppy turned bankrobber.  It is curious how someone who is so popular can be such a rotten character, with very few individuals understanding his true (nasty) self.  Yes, I agree this element of the story was interesting.  But it didn't exactly sustain my interest for the entire four hundred pages.  And unlike Ann Rule's better books there are no sensational courtroom dramas or abhorent violence to ponder over.  Yet Ann Rule, if nothing else, produces very readable material.  I gobbled down the pages like junk food. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: Ann Rule on a bad day.  There are better ways of killing time.	2004-08-14

'Bodily Harm' is certainly not the best work by the sometimes brilliant Margaret Atwood.  I'm not sure what possessed her to write about a young woman undergoing deep self-examination after having a mastectomy and, bizarrely, soon finds herself in some civil unrest in a banana republic.  What saves this book from being totally silly are the characterizations and Atwood's stellar prose.  However I have to admit the last twenty percent of 'Bodily Harm' where our central character is caught up in political unrest whilst on a holiday-from-hell is really a waste.  Not terrible, just wholely implausible. <br /> <br />There probably isn't much value in describing the plot further.  For those who loved Atwood's more female-centric novels (such as 'The Robber Bride') I recommend 'Bodily Harm'.  But for those who have not experienced the wonder of Margaret Atwood I suggest reading 'The Blind Assassin'. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: an uneven but overall decent read.	2004-08-08

Unfortunately the combination of the two makes it to be a but jumbley, with neither theme being fully exploited.  The fact that the author, James Ellroy, is a very popular crime writer adds an enticing twist ... and the man can write.  But in the end 'My Dark Places' left me with the impression that the book served as primarily some sort of soul-searching exercise by Ellroy rather than something to be enjoyed by the reader. <br /> <br />Oh, there are some interesting moments.  The murder of Jean Ellroy is graphically recounted.  James Ellroy's perspective of this murder, both as a boy when it happened and as an adult researching the case (..still unsolved), is intriguing and unexpected.  However Ellroy also goes into great detail of his rather wasted youth ... it seems he was a total mess for half his life.  This was not too interesting, and his transformation from dunken hobo to crime writer extraordinary and member of the establishment is not really addressed.  So I felt this entire element was a real waste. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a very mixed bag.  Certainly a must read for Ellroy fans.  However I'm not so sure if anyone else while find value in reading it.	2004-07-31

'Setting Free the Bears' is an early work by John Irving that would have been normally out of print, and deservedly so, if it were not for his later fame from 'The World According to Garp'.  In some ways the book is similar to 'The New Hotel Hampshire', a book I actually didn't care for, but lacks the humor or the huggable characters (or the curious incest sub-plot, thank goodness).  So what exactly is wrong with 'Setting Free the Bears'?<br />Well the plot itself is rather strange and somewhat incomprehensible.  A young Austrian college student bumps into a very quirky fellow, and together the tour Austria on motorcycle.  Just when you think the book will turn into a funny road story with an Austrian twist the author decides to split the story in two, with the a narrative of the main character camped out at a zoo and his strange friend narrating his (pre-war) family history.  Very disappointing, and very dull.  The ending concludes in comical fashion back at the zoo.  But this fun ending is too little, too late.<br />Bottom line: a very amateurish effort by the often outstanding John Irving.  A definite miss.	2004-07-17

The author laces in humor at the right times without having it all spiral into Bridget Jones-like silliness (, which wouldn't be bad per se but it would dilute the emotional impact of the stories).  It is unfortunate that because of the it's title and how it is marketed men aren't likely to read this book.  The book actually has a balanced (read: non-condescending) view of men which is refreshing from a book which sees men from a woman's perspective.<br />While a couple of the stories are not too good, especially the last one which shares the same title as the book, the first story  about a teenage girl on vacation with her family at the Jersey shore is like a female &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.  Terrific stuff.<br />Bottom line: not for women only.  Well done.	2004-07-09

Being a resident Floridian I was hoping for some local Florida 'attitude' in this Randy Wayne White novel, much like what is delivered in the novels by Carl Hiaasen.  But Randy Wayne White is no Carl Hiaasen in terms humor or delivering home a green-friendly message in an interesting piece of fiction.  Nor does his oh-so-typically-cool investigator leading man, Doc Ford, add any credibility to the story.  Unlike the other amazon.com reviewers before me I found 'Sanibel Flats' to be entirely derivative (un-original).<br />As for the story, it starts of okay with the reader getting into Doc Ford's world of island living in southwest Florida.  He has some rather idiosyncratic neighbors, and the author throws in some well-paced comic turns.  But then the story turns on a dime and the plot shifts to Central America, revolutionaries, ancient Mayan mysteries, drug smuggling, etc, etc, before wrapping up back in Florida.  So our huggable Floridian Doc Ford actually turns up to be Indiana Jones.  Entertaining?  Not really; the story never really ignites and is wrapped up in an extremely contrived fashion.  But on the plus side the author does write reasonable well (decent prose), and I felt his depiction of Florida and Floridians was right on the mark.<br />Bottom line: a bit of a mess really.  Perhaps better suited for those looking for a jungle adventure story than a Florida-based mystery.	2004-07-06

The other 24 are only fair or downright poor or even amateurish.

618145:US	50667536	R25TCPTOWILJJT	0451165926	857750104	I, the Jury (Mike Hammer)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	a thoroughly enjoyable yet over-the-top mystery yarn...	\\"I, the Jury\\" is the first of several Mike Hammer (private investigator) mystery novels, and it happens to be my first Mickey Spillane novel.  Based on all the hype I thought it would similar to Raymond Chandler novel, with his Philip Marlowe character.  I discovered this to be largely untrue, which isn't entirely a bad thing.<br />In \\"I, the Jury\\" we have a lovable cad of a private investigator looking for the killer of his best friend.  But he seeks justice in a very crude way - revenge (ie, he's out for blood).  Of course during the way he meets with some sexy \\"broads\\" (to use the vernacular of the times) who, of course, fall madly in love with him.  So far this doesn't sound far off from a Raymond Chandler novel.  However with Mickey Spillane the dialogue is less clever (yet easier to read), the prose is only fair, and the story could have been told better.  In \\"I, the Jury\\" the rather terrific ending is very quickly brought to the surface is an an abrupt way.  So Raymond Chandler seems to be the much better writer, capturing the essence of 1940s Los Angeles and the folks who inhabit skid row.  Mickey Spillane's book is set in New York but it could have been Anywhere, USA, and I didn't exactly feel hurdled back in time.  But I enjoyed \\"I, the Jury\\" overall and I will read others in the Mike Hammer series.<br />Bottom line: a bit crude but very entertaining piece of private eye nonsense.  In its own way it is deserving of its status as as classic.	2004-06-23

Michael Moore is obviously a clever, talented man.  However judging by 'Stupid White Men..' the man should stick to documentary film-making, not writing books.  <br />Of course I expected some seriously over-the-top ranting about how awful Dubya and the current crop of Republicans really are, told with a comic twist.  And Moore generally delivers the goods.  But the book is very flimsy from a journalistic perspective; the author just editorializes -preaches- endlessly, and the scope of his attacks run far and wide.  For those who want a sometimes funny but very serious look at the failings of our present administration I suggest reading 'Bushwacked..' by Ivins and Dubose.<br />Bottom line: a bit too much emotional ranting for my taste.  But still, it's a low caloric easy read for those who describe themselves as anything but Republican.	2004-06-13

Colin Bateman is one of my favorite authors; I've read nearly all his novels.  Its not to say they are uniformly good, but they are all entertaining and sometimes hilarious.  He has been described as a Northern Ireland version of Carl Hiaasen, which is actually a compliment.<br />Unfortunately 'Empire State', like a couple other books of his with a storyline rooted in North America, is not among his better works.  It is a rather far-fetched story of a racist, a rejected lover turned reluctant terrorist, a kidnapped American President who seems oddly like Bill Clinton, with the most of the activity situated atop the Empire State building.  The action is a bit slapstick in nature, and the characterizations rather ... crude.  But it all sticks together, somehow.<br />Not central to the story, but I cannot help by adding a mini-spoiler here:<br />//spoiler// <BR>There is a plane crash at the top floors of the Empire State building.  Although this book was written a few years before 9/11 I imagine this minor element of this book has not encouraged the publisher to promote it, which is a bit of shame. <br />//end spoiler//<br />Bottom line: a curious yet overall very average effort by Colin Bateman.  Best left to his loyal fans only.	2004-06-02

While no longer in print 'The Preserving Machine and Other Stories' by Philip K. Dick is worth seeking out.  Originally printed around 1970, it contains about a dozen of the author's better short stories from early in his career (early 1950s to mid-1960s).  The author has pumped out many dozens of short stories and novels, ranging from very good to truly incomprehensible, and modern short story collections of his work are very uneven.  However since this collection was compiled during the author's prime I suspect its quality was assured by the author himself.<br />It is hard to choose which story is best.  But they all take place on Earth in the near or distant future.  Of course there is a smattering of time travel and alien occupation.  Yet for myself, not a loyal fan of science fiction, I found them to be intriguing rather than too far fetched.  One particular story involving people being thrust into the mind's of others, thus exposing hidden prejudices and distorted views of reality, is simply brilliant.<br />Bottom line: a must for all Philip K. Dick collections.  Excellent.	2004-05-14

'Prey' has all the hallmarks of a Michael Crichton science fiction novel: thrilling suspense wrapped in a story that stretches the imagination to the breaking point.  It has the feeling of a good film screenplay rather than a novel, but to be fair Crichton is a good writer.  Both his prose and characterizations are fine.<br />'Prey' takes us into the near future when nanotechnolgy (building microscopic computers) and biotechnology converge to a nasty effect.  Silicon Valley scientists fail to understand the true menace they've unleashed and it is up to the spouse of one of the dirty players to save the world.  Crichton spends a fair amount of time trying to explain how all this horror is plausible.  I didn't buy it but at least it's not preposterous.  And the suspensful storytelling had me going.  Great fun!<br />Bottom line: shamelessly enjoyable piece of science fiction fluff.  Recommended.	2004-04-25

Since it is an award-winning mystery, complete with accolades from amazon.com (on their Best of 2001 list), I thought I couldn't go wrong with it.  Wrong.  No, the book isn't awful.  It's more like a mess with some interesting bits strewn about.<br />As for the story, well this is hard to explain.  We have an aging private investigator from Montana fighting all sorts of nasty people (druggies, tramps, law enforcers) in Austin, Texas.  Lots of strange characters, which is one of the book's strengths, caught up in a completely ridiculous plot.  The book is also compromised by its absurd violence, on the order of a Quentin ('Kill Bill') Tarentino film.  Yet Crumley's prose is rather decent, complete with crisp (and often hilarious) dialogue.<br />Bottom line: a hit-and-miss sort of book.  But for this reader it was mostly a miss.	2004-04-19

The so-called plot involves a madcap chase of briefcase containing $5 million in cash.  While there are a few gratuitous murders this is hardly be called a crime story.  Yet like Carl Hiaasen novels 'The Stingray Shuffle' contains plenty of Florida-isms; locals like me will love the historical references to Henry Flagler, the pioneering railroads of a century ago, etc.  Too bad Tim Dorsey doesn't seem to have the satiric wit of Hiaasen.  His humour is very childish in comparison.<br />Bottom line: a very silly yet often funny book.  Passable.	2004-03-27

Firstly, I have read just about all books by George Pelecanos through 'Soul Circus' ... and so I can be described as one of his fans.  I eagerly awaited the publication of 'Soul Circus' in paperback form.  Having just finished I am sad to say I was disappointed.<br />Oh, it has all the hallmarks of his other works: gritty urban crime, drugs, and despair in Washington, DC.  It also has one of Pelecanos's regular characters, the self-employed private eye Derek Strange (..he was also in 'Hell to Pay' and 'Right as Rain').  Yet somehow the story seems vaguely similar, sort of a blend of his prior novels. Could I be suffering from 'Pelecanos burn out'?  No, this is the first of his books I've read in several months.<br />Bottom line: for those who haven't read anything from Pelecanos, skip this book at go to 'Right as Rain', 'Hell to Pay', or one of the several books leading with the Nick Stephanos character.	2004-03-13

'The I-5 Killer' is a decent but unremarkable effort by Ann Rule, the queen of true crime novels.  While it does give accounts of horrible sexual crimes and murders by a completely unrepetent monster, the book lacks many elements of Ann Rule's better works: intricate courtroom drama, in-depth analysis of the criminal's background, and detailed chronology of the police/forensic work done in proving the criminal's guilt.  I suppose all this is unsurprising since 'The I-5 Killer' is only about half the length of Ann Rule's best works (eg, 'The Stranger Beside Me').<br />Bottom line: certainly very readable and credible, but Ann Rule can and has done better.	2004-03-05

Dick's golden era (late 1960s/early 1970s), is a forgotten jewel.  And it is one of the few novels by the author that might appeal to folks who don't care for science fiction since the story doesn't involve space travel, time travel or aliens.<br />The clever story involves an accident at a scientific lab where several unconscious folks are absorbed into the minds of another victim who is conscious.  So in effect they live in the world of how another person sees it - distorted, bizarre, and often dangerous.  Yes, it all sounds a bit daft.  And in the beginning I wasn't sure if this story line would hold.  But actually the story gets more and more engaging.  I think 'Eye in the Sky' should be viewed as one of Philip K. Dick's best works, along with 'Ubik' and 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\".<br />Bottom line: a must read for Philip K. Dick fans (present and future).  Recommended.	2004-02-28

The first category has Murakami classics such as 'Norwegian Wood' and 'South of the Border, West of Sun', and the latter has 'A Wild Sheep Chase' and 'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle'.  'Dance, Dance, Dance', being a sequel to 'A Wild Sheep Chase', is about as weird as anything published by Murakami.  And it is about as good, ... which is to say it is very good indeed.<br />It is very hard to explain the novel since the story is so .. strange, convoluted, surreal, etc.  We have altered realities, a 13 year old spoilt girl with precognition powers, and a befuddled young Japanese man caught in the middle.  It all works, sort of.  Believable?  Not even close.<br />Bottom line: a book best enjoyed by seasoned Murakami readers.  Fans will love it.	2004-02-22

It is narrated by the ghostly (or perhaps better said, 'angelic') spirit of a murdered teenaged girl.  She tells the story of her murder (..not too gruesome) and how it had affected the lives of her family and friends.  This might sound fine but it's not, or at least not entirely.<br />The book starts off somewhat moody and dark, as we understand how the narrator was killed.  Very reminiscent of 'Being Dead' by Jim Crace (... a rather good book).  But then the book switches gears and becomes more of a domestic drama (her family breaks up, her sister falls in love, etc).  And it eventually evolves into a spiritual &quot;touchy feely&quot; mess, much like the movie 'Ghost' (okay, it wasn't a bad movie).  So after starting out rather well 'The Lovely Bones' goes downhill.  The ending was very anti-climatic.<br />Bottom line: a book that should have very good turns out to be unexceptional.  Not recommended.	2004-02-07

The story is typical Sharpe craziness; it really isn't worth trying to explain it all.  However 'Wilt on High' strikes me as one of Sharpe's weaker efforts, which is especially disappointing since the book starts off rather nicely.<br />It is advisable to read 'Wilt' before 'Wilt on High' since it is more or less a sequel.  Besides 'Wilt' is a much better read - a classic.	2004-02-02

This is especially true if reading graphic accounts of sadistic animal cruelty and the murdering of small children is viewed as offensive to the reader.  I suppose I would have tolerated all this gruesume stuff if it served a useful purpose but, having just finished 'The Wasp Factory', I'm not sure it did.<br />Well the story itself is very strange.  An isolated Scottish family with one very wicked teenager who creates a strange little world for himself.  This world is populated with various dead insect (including wasps, naturally) and animal parts.  His brother is a horribly disturbed young man too, with a particularly nasty urge to burn dogs alive.  Lovely. ;)<br />The only salvation to this book is that it is indeed well-written, and it has a fairly good ending.  But I really don't think it was worth the journey.<br />Bottom line: gratuitously disgusting.  Iain Banks has written better.	2004-01-29

It always makes me feel bad to critise a novel when, as in the case of 'Brick Lane' by Monica Ali, the author has placed her heart and soul into every word.  This colourful story of Bangladeshi-Engish cultural blending is certainly passionate.  However if it weren't for this passion the book would be a dud; it attempts to cover way too much ground (drugs, infidelity, inter-religious issues, inter-cultural issues, Bangladeshi folklore, etc).  By mid-way I wasn't sure the whether author knew where she was going with 'Brick Lane'.  Less would have been a lot more.<br />As for the story itself, it is about a young Bangladeshi woman and her husband (from an arranged marriage) who settle in an east London council flat.  Both of them have difficulties maintaining their Islamic values in this very foreign country, with their children seemingly suffering even more.  The author does a fine job in describing the heartache of these Bangladeshi families who are most often trapped in their own homes, afraid to leave.  However as the story progresses the author, as I explain above, losses focus.  And this reader gradually lost interest.  Yet thanks to Monica Ali I think I understand my east London neighbours a bit better.<br />Bottom line: Monica Ali's love of Bangladesh and London permeate 'Brick Lane'.  This alone makes it an impressive debut.	2004-01-25

Complete with bizarre characters, a locked room murder, magic (!), and a sleuth who knowingly outwits everyone, this book is an over-the-top, hysterical example of detective stories (by the likes of Ngaio Marsh, Agatha Christie, Earl Stanley Gardner) adored by generations.  It also has a delightfully dated 1930s London feel (think cardigans, fireplaces, smoking jackets, etc).<br />So snuggle up on a winter's evening, place your brain in 'suspend disbelief' mode, and enjoy this very clever yet silly story by John Dickson Carr.  If nothing else it will bring a smile to your face.	2004-01-19

The authors are clearly a bit left wing and *extremely* critical of their country.  Strange, and all this anger about the Swedish social condition does get tiresome, but is works.<br />As for the story, two rather unusual crimes (a locked room murder first viewed as a suicide) and a bank robbery/murder baffle the Stockholm police force.  But as the story unfolds we understand these two incidents are related.  The conclusion is surprising and *very* cynical.<br />My only complaint with the book is that it has a dated feel to it, and the prose (or translation?) is a bit flat.  For example during the bank robbery the robber says &quot;hands up!&quot; and the teller says &quot;you'll never get away with it!&quot;.  Not very original, eh?<br />Bottom line: a curious but forgotten mystery novel.  Not worth seeking out but certainly an interesting diversion.	2004-01-12

Let me cut to the chase:  'Diary: A Novel' is by a wide margin the worst novel produced by Chuck Palahniuk.  These words come from someone who, like many, thought his early works ('Fight Club', 'Survivor', 'Invisible Monsters') were either very good or *unbelievably good*.  His more recent novels (ie, 'Lullaby', 'Choke') were merely passable.  But 'Diary...' is a stinker; it was hard work just to finish it.<br />So what's 'Diary...' about?  Well this is part of the problem.  It is a very strange story about a woman with unique artistic capabilities who marries into a nightmarishly bizarre family living on a tourist-trap island.  We learn eventually that her emergence on the island was pre-destined, as proscribed by history and folklore.  Interesting?  Not really.  Funny?  No.  The worst offense: the book is very poorly structured, and its prose is weak.  It lacks the punch and unique Palahniuk humour found in his early books.<br />Bottom line: this book is certainly a black spot on Palahniuk's career.  Rubbish.	2004-01-09

'Astonishing Splashes of Colour' is a rather involved story of a young woman struggling to come to terms with her inability to have children, her own distorted childhood, and her strained relationship with her husband and her family.  So yes, it covers a lot of ground.  And as the story unravels it gets a bit ... melodramatic, unfortunately.  Yet the book is anything but a disappointment.  Clare Morrall's prose is fine, especially so for an inexperienced novelist.  But it is her deep, compassionate characterization of the lead character that really salvages 'Astonishing Splashes of Colour'.  The author's sincerity shines through.<br />Bottom line: a mature look at painful memories.  Recommended.	2004-01-04

However after reading several of his books I fear Pelecanos is falling somewhat into the John Grisham mold - that is, his stories often seem too similar.  You read one, you've read them all.  Fortunately for Pelecanos it really doesn't matter what the story is about; one loves getting lost in his wasted Washington environment.  Folks from urban America, especially those aged between 30 and 50, will really relate to the characters in his books.<br />Bottom line: another successful installment from the Pelecanos \\"factory\\".

'The Good Doctor' by Damon Galgut is a very well-written yet strange story about a semi-derelict hospital in a remote corner of modern South Africa.  It largely centers around the lives of two resident doctors.  One doctor, having been there for years, is entirely defeatist on everything: the hospital, his profession, his country.  The other ('good') doctor, new to the scene and fresh out of school, still thinks he can make a positive change.  In the end both views are blended together, each becoming distorted.<br />Overall the story is a bit bleak; no humour here.  Its appeal is limited to those who have a interest in South Africa.  Yet to his credit, I think 'The Good Doctor' can catipult its author to international recognition along the same lines as Coetzee.  While 'The Good Doctor' isn't an exceptional story I felt it was exceptionally well-written.<br />Bottom line: a must read for those interested in the strange and wonderful South Africa.  Damon Galgut is an author to watch.	2003-12-31

'Welcome to Paradise' is one of those &quot;read and forget&quot;-type of books.  It'll bring a few smiles, and it is certainly easy enough to read.  But this book is the literary equivalent of empty calories, which is sad because Shames has written novels that are both funny and with some bite (..'Sunburn' is my favorite).<br />As for the plot, it is innocent nonsense about a good guy salesman from Jersey on holiday in Key West being hounded by some not-too-bright thugs.  It's all a simple case of mistaken identity.  Throw in a mutual love interest and ... that's about it.  Nothing more to it.<br />Bottom line: mindless, juvenile humor in a short book with no pretentions.	2003-12-29

'The Big Clock' by Kenneth Fearing is a short yet delightful novel of suspense.  Written in 1946, the book must have been considered scandalous due to its explicit references to lesbianism (although this has little to do with the plot).  No doubt it was relegated as &quot;pulp fiction&quot; and subsequently ignored until much later when that genre was rediscovered.  Thankfully the book is now in print (at least here in the UK).<br />'The Big Clock' has a very clever plot ... so clever that I'd hate to spoil it for anyone.  Let's just say it involves murder, the attempt to frame the murder on an innocent party, with this innocent party caught in the middle.  The anxiety level increases very nicely ... 'The Big Clock' is a page-turner.  I have only two minor quibbles with it: the beginning is a bit slow (and odd), and the ending seemed somewhat flat.<br />BTW, the film 'No Way Out' is said to be based on this book.  While the film is terrific let us say it is *very loosely* based on the book.<br />Bottom line: justly deserving its status as a crime classic.  Recommended.	2003-12-29

I've read three so far, including the winner 'Vernon God Little'.  By a wide margin 'Notes on a Scandal' is the superior novel, much to my surprise.<br />Firstly, I did not expect a book about a teacher having an affair with a 15 year old boy, a student at her school, to be particularly interesting; such scandals are not too uncommon, and I find them to be rather distasteful and sad.  And while on the surface 'Notes on a Scandal' is nothing more than notes-of-a-scandal (notes taken from the teacher's best and perhaps only friend), it deeply chronicles the emotions and lives of both the teacher and her friend.  The characterizations are brilliant, the prose is sublime without being pretentious (..no need to have a dictionary handly).  This is the best book I've read in quite some time; I'd have to imagine a film adaptation has to be in the cards.<br />Bottom line: deceptively wonderful.  Strongly recommended.	2003-12-27

'Arrogance...' by Bernard Goldberg was given to me as an Xmas present by a couple of conservative American colleagues.  It also represents the first present I would gladly give back.  While I am certainly not conservatively minded, 'Arrogance...' is from many angles simply a dreadful book.  I thought it would be a balanced study of possible left wing biased journalism in American news programs (television and print).  And while the author does raise interesting points, his evidence seems little more than anecdotal fluff.  He more effectively demonstrates episodes of bad journalism rather than institutional biased journalism.<br />But what really made me ill was that clearly 70+% of 'Arrogance...' is a anger-filled blast against non-conservatives, often done with a very sarcastic and rude manner.  It has been quite some time since I read anything which seemed utterly soaked in *hatred*.  Perhaps it is stemmed in professional jealousy (..he is forever demonizing the American elite news presenters such as Rather, Brokaw)?  Not sure, but Bernard Goldberg has done his conservative-minded fellow Americans a great disservice in writing this book.  The way to win an argument is through rational debate armed with irrefutable facts, not through vile rhetoric and &quot;lets take one episode and make sweeping generalizaitons&quot;.<br />Bottom line: reading 'Arrogance..' will do little more than lower your IQ a couple of notches.  200+ pages of hate.	2003-12-27

Cain novels I've read.  Unfortunately it seems that beyond his best known works ('The Postman Always Rings Twice', 'Mildred Pierce', 'Double Indemnity') he has pumped out a number of mediocre novels, including 'Butterfly'.<br />'Butterfly' is a novel on incest in a coal mining community in rural West Virginia during the 1930s.  No doubt the story was shocking when first written (in 1946) but now the material seems fairly lame.  The essence of older man/teenaged girl lust is captured much better in the infamous 'Lolita'.  In 'Butterfly' we don't get to really feel smoldering passion or the intense shame associated with incest.  While the prose is very readable the characterizations are fairly weak, as one would expect in a novel of little more than 100 pages.<br />Bottom line: James M. Cain on a bad day is still pretty okay, but he has done much better (especially in 'Mildred Pierce').	2003-12-23

'Vernon God Little' by DBC Pierre is a curious book, made even curiousier by winning the 2003 Booker Prize (British Commonwealth equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize).  The story is about Vernon, a teenager in rural Texas, accused as the accomplice in a massacre at his high school.  No one believes poor Vernon, and from his eyes it seems everyone around him is a bit loopy ... especially a Geraldo Rivera-wannabe reporter.  While the story is anything but believable, the author deserves kudos for his very insightful study of one hapless, confused young man.  The essence of Vernon is captured perfectly, often hilariously.  This saves the book from being a very cheap shot at rural America and its youth.<br />I should add that people should NOT take 'Vernon Little God' personally.  It is satire, and pure fiction.  The book looks at the world from a introverted teenager, who seemingly sees the worst side of small town America.  And the book is not anti-Texas.  The author could have easily transported the setting to rural Canada or Australia.<br />Worthy of the Booker Prize?  No, I thought 'Oryx &amp; Crake' was better (..and I haven't even read the other four nominated books).<br />Bottom line: funny and at times insightful but its lack of depth and over-the-top storyline compromises for what could have been a great book.	2003-12-22

'Oryx and Crake' is a very well-observed, fictionalized account of how modern day bio-engineering science can literally destroy mankind, to be replaced by a wide variety of human-engineered entities.  Of course it is *science fiction*, and much of what Ms Atwood describes is a bit far-fetched.  But only a bit.  This reader until now thought nothing wrong of bio-engineered crops and current activities involving animal (and human?) cloning.  Thanks to 'Oryx and Crake' I can now see where everything can go horribly wrong.<br />In 'Oryx and Crake' we have North America some fifty years in the future.  Science has really achieved breakthroughs bio-engineering animals for such purposes as growing human organs, all with a total disregard of the consequences.  Corporate competitiveness drives such activity to manic proportions when, unsurprisingly, complete disaster strikes.  All this is told through a survivor, Snowman, as he relates his life and those of Crake, his genius friend, and Oryx, their love interest.<br />No, this book isn't at the supreme quality of Atwood's brilliant 'The Blind Assassin'.  The prose is only decent, as are the characterizations.  But 'Oryx and Crake' certainly doesn't disappoint; Ms Atwood has done herself proud.<br />Bottom line: the future as it might very well be.  Recommended.	2003-12-18

Clearly the author wishes he was born 50 years earlier so he can live along side the likes of Raymond Chandler, James Cain and Dashiell Hammett ... the champions on 1940s 'noir' fiction.  Being a fan of this genre I can say James Ellroy goes a long way in emulating his idols, but he falls somewhat sort of the mark.<br />Oh, the story itself is a wonder.  Loosely based on actual events, 'Black Dahlia' involves the horrific mutilation of a young woman and the perversely obsessed cop tracking down her killer.  No spoilers here, but Ellroy does a great job in engaging the reader while throwing in some plot twists.  And he does a commendable job on the characterizations.  So what could be wrong?<br />Well I had the feeling the author tried *too hard* to capture the essence of 1940s Los Angeles, especially concerning the lingo.  Raymond Chandler-esque tough guy talk taken to, at times, an almost incomprehensible level.  While it did take some getting used to I found this gratuitous verbage to be a distraction during the first third of the book ... enough to detract me from reading any more from James Ellroy.  Yet to be fair I found the foul language to be far more realistic compared to the relatively sanitized dialogue found in books written from the period.<br />Bottom line: certainly a bizarre, remarkable story.  Recommended.	2003-12-16

'Mystic River' is my third Dennis Lehane novel, and by a fair margin the best so far.  Unlike 'Darkness, Take My Hand' and 'Prayers for Rain', 'Mystic River' is not about private investigators who use unorthodox means of capturing violent psychotics.  Instead it focuses on the lives of three men, first as youngsters involved in an abduction, then as adults when the past catches up with them.  This might all sound rather \\"Oprah-ish\\" but in fact it is tightly written, with terrific characterizations and a very compelling plot (yes, it involves murder).<br />I suppose part of the reason I like 'Mystic River' is that it proves Lehane can write terrific stuff without resorting to sensationalistic scenes of violence.  No gratuitous shock.  'Mystic River' reminds me very much of the works of Georges Pelecanos, except for the Boston setting (Pelecanos 'does' Washington).<br />Bottom line: exceptionally good.  Little wonder its film adaptation is a success.	2003-12-15

I first read 'In Cold Blood' in the late 1960s as a young teenager, didn't think much of it, and subsequently forgot all about it.  However I when I discovered a copy at a secondhand bookstore I decided to give it a try - after all, I am a fan of true crime books (especially those from Ann Rule).  I'm very happy I made the purchase.<br />'In Cold Blood' reads entirely like a novel, which is good since Capote writes beautiful prose but it's also bad because the reader has no idea what is fact and what is conjecture on the part of the author.  While the crime involved, the brutal slaying of a rural Kansas family circa 1960, is horrific it is not the main focus of the book.  The author concentrates on the wasted lives of the murderers, a stark contrast to the picture-perfect lives of the victims.  So 'In Cold Blood' is more of a character study rather than an exercise in police investigative techniques, courtroom drama, or forensic science which seem to be prevalent in modern true crime stories.  <br />Bottom line: rural Americana of years gone by like we never knew or simply chose to forget.  Recommended.	2003-12-09

Cornell Woolrich is one of those 1940s writers who pumped out loads of pulp fiction that have by now largely gone out of print.  He was a very good storyteller but only an average writer - that is, his prose and characterizations are not particularly good.  'The Bride Wore Black' fits this rule completely. <br />In 'The Bride Wore Black' we have essentially five different murder stories with one seemingly common element: the same murderess.  In the end we understand a bit more about her motive and why these victims were chosen.  Woolrich also delivers a delicious surprise ending.  Don't expect any subplots or side romances.  This is pure, simple reading enjoyment that doesn't tax the brain but keeps your eyes glued to the pages.<br />Bottom line: certainly among Woolrich's better books.  Highly recommended.	2003-12-01

'Darkness, Take My Hand' is certainly a book not for the squeamish, as are Lehane's other books.  In it we have our Boston private eyes (a man/woman pairing who, naturally, form something beyond a professional relationship) embroiled in a mystery where psychopaths mutilate residents of an inner Boston neighborhood.  As the story unravels we understand these criminal monsters actually have their origins many years earlier, with a direct relationship to one of the private eye's own childhood.  This book is filled with Lehane's characteristic plot twists, and the story matures nicely to a fine conclusion.<br />But this book is not great.  I felt the prose was somewhat weaker than in other Lehane novels; this man is capable of writing *literature*.  But 'Darkness...' seems to be relatively devoid of witty dialogue or sparkling prose, unlike for example 'Prayers for Rain'.  However Lehane is still in fine form with wonderful characterizations.<br />Bottom line: a nasty and disturbing story of depravity and corruption.  Not amongst Lehane's best but still a very worthy read.	2003-11-28

'The Bridge of San Luis Rey' is a deceptively simple set of inter-related stories about a handful of people who perish when a primitive bridge collapses in eighteenth century Peru.  Sounds dull?  Well,.. wrong.  Thornton Wilder does a fine job in describing personal angst and hardship of these people; their plight can easily be told in a modern setting.  I was especially moved by the one story of a older woman trying to come to terms with the decaying relationship between herself and her daughter.  Yet, unsurprisingly, not all the stories affected me personally.  Sort of hit-and-miss.  But in the end I felt moved by it all; this short book does leave you with the feeling you've read something significant.<br />Bottom line: an uneven but ultimately very satisfying read.	2003-11-28

Yet in truth he has written some rubbish (eg, &quot;Something About Harry&quot;).  He works best when his stories stay close to his home (Northern Ireland) and uses elements which are undoubtedly part of his personal experiences (foul-mouth sarcastic banter, excess drinking, etc).  But unfortunately &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot; is set in Canada, and the story line is rather contrived (a polite way of saying 'stupid').<br />In &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot; we have shenanigans involving a drugged out pop rocker who is definitely on the slide, a woman who is seemingly an ancient native American princess who's come back to life, and a cop with his own problems trying to put eveything together.  Surprisingly, this nonsense actually flows rather well in the beginning with Bateman providing some good laughs.  But towards the end it all gets very farcical; I just didn't find the slapstick humor to be funny at all.<br />Bottom line: come back to your roots Bateman!  You have done much better than this.	2003-11-27

Boy, what a waste of time and money!  <br />Our 'story', such as it is, involves Stephanie and a guardian angel studpuppy she discovers in her apartment one morning (..duh!).  Together they embark on some silliness involving elves and beings with supernatural power (..double duh!).  Combine this absurdity with very little in the way of humor, a near absence of favorite supporting characters (eg, Lula), and plainly *very weak* prose I am convinced Janet Evanovich wrote this book while sitting on the toilet - because this is where 'Visions of Sugar Plums' belong (..in the toilet).<br />Bottom line: Janet Evanovich does her fans a tremendous unjustice with this laughly BAD effort.  Don't read it even if it you get it as an Xmas gift.	2003-11-26

Her prose is always elegant.  Unfortunately her shorter novels have a tendency to clash with her style; characterizations are not well-developed, the outcome somewhat forced.  This is generally true also with this collection of short novels written by Du Maurier late in her career. &quot;Don't Look Now&quot; and &quot;Not After Midnight&quot; are the better of the bunch, but none are enthralling ... certainly not when compared to her best short novel &quot;The Birds&quot; (yes, the story from which the film is loosely based on).<br />Bottom line: go for the author's novels (eg, &quot;The Scapegoat&quot; or &quot;Rebecca&quot;) instead of these stories.

Quite honestly I was somewhat disappointed with my first John Sandford novel ('Rules of Prey'), mostly because too much time was spent on the lead character (a police investigator), his famous love life, etc.  But I saw 'Eyes of Prey' in a secondhand book shop, bought it, read it, and ... wow!  Mr Sandford did a much better job with this third installment of the 'prey' series.<br />In 'Eyes of Prey' we still have our stud puppy Minneapolis police investigator trying to solve the murder/mutiliation of an adulterous woman.  Her husband, a medical professional and substance abuser, is not a suspect but ... he *seems* to be involved.  However when these horrendous events repeat themselves we are pulled into the sick world of the husband and another very curious character.  Thankfully Sandford spends little time on the private life of the hero and concentrates on delivering a slick (and frighteningly believable) crime story.  Lots of plot twists, scary moments, etc.  And the ending (literally the last page) is terrific.<br />Bottom line: not for the squeamish.  But this is one nightmare told with panache.	2003-11-18

'The Human Stain' is a somewhat difficult book to review.  It attempts to dig into the American pysche on race identification and discrimination by presenting a somewhat hard to believe story of a professor scandalized by (allegedly) racial remarks made in class.  The author has seemingly taken on too broad of a subject, then attempts to tie it together with some very over-cooked prose ... at times it gets very pretentious.  Yet Philip Roth succeeds with characterizations which are most memorable; the book does have its moments.<br />I suppose my biggest disappointment with 'The Human Stain' is when it is compared to vastly superior works by the likes of James Baldwin.  The author doesn't quite get the sense of ... (despair? frustration?) of being an African-American in post-war America.  He throws in convoluted sentences, has his characters shrieking in angst, and it all just gets out of control.<br />Bottom line: a complex yet unsatisfying book.  Not recommended.	2003-11-13

My first two Laurence Shames novels, 'Florida Straits' and 'Sunburn', are seemingly his best (with 'Sunburn' being especially good).  The few others I've read seem hollow in comparison, with 'Tropical Depression' being no exception.  Oh, there are some funny moments.  But the book falls into the &quot;easy, fun read yet totally forgettable&quot; category.<br />The story has a neat premise though.  A depressed, middle-aged businessman (the &quot;bra king&quot; of New Jersey) moves down to Key West to clear his head.  There he meets an equally depressed native American Indian.  Both of them get into some (rather silly) business ventures which gets them tangled with the Mafia, and a corrupt state official.  The story has sprinkles of Carl Hiaasen, with its &quot;white man has defaced the natural beauty of Florida and its aboriginal inhabitants&quot; messages.  Sadly, Laurence Shames doesn't hold a candle to Carl Hiaasen.  Weaker prose, laughs without satiric wit ... it all seems too fluffy.<br />Bottom line: a trifling novel by Shames.  Yet it is an easy read.  Bring it to the beach.	2003-11-09

'A Firing Offense', as judged by many amazon.com reviewers, is not the most thrilling of crime novels by Pelecanos.  In fact the criminal aspect of this story, which only comes to light towards the end (..no spoilers), is somewhat thin.  However this book simply oozes with atmosphere.  1980s wasted youth, drug culture, with the lead character (Nick Stephanos) definitely in a &quot;desperately seeking something&quot; mode.  I felt transported back in time to a different place.  There is something also of a Jack Kerouac feel to it also as much of the book takes place on the road.<br />Bottom line: perhaps not a stellar Pelecanos novel but I enjoyed the ride.

Coming off of reading my first Dennis Lehane book, which was simply terrific, 'Rule of Prey' in comparison seemed ... amateurish.  Oh, the story is fine.  Serial killer, enigmatic police investigator, plenty of twists and turns.  But Sandford's prose seems rather flat; it read like a script to a good TV crime program or film.  And the leading protaganists seemed very formulaic.  The likes of Lehane, (Patricia) Highsmith, and (Jim) Thompson have all done much better in dissecting the mind of psychopaths and delivering compelling stories.  Having said all this 'Rules of Prey' is a fast and compulsive read.<br />Now back to the story, we have your psychotic monster who gets sexual pleasure by killing women.  He knows he's psychotic.  And he knows he's very intelligent.  The local police department recruits supercop, who is naturally \\"a sex machine with all the chicks\\", to find this monster.  As I mention above the story has bumps and turns.  It also has a decent ending (no spoilers here).<br />Bottom line: certainly this territory has covered by better writers than Sandford.  Still, 'Rules of Prey' is an enjoyable read.	2003-11-03

Tom Sharpe's novels, always popular in Britain, are known for being rude spoofs on the political establishment and of the upper echelons of British society.  However his earliest works, as in 'Indecent Exposure', the setting is apartheid-era South Africa.  His humour is still very baudy, perhaps repetitively so, and his target are the hypocritical, racist white establishment.  Some of the language is a bit vulgar, and I imagine some folks might be offended.  But Sharpe hits the bulls-eye on his target: the squabbling, pretentious and myoptic white (English/Afrikaan) establishment.<br />As for the story?  Well, it somewhat doesn't matter.  Some nonsense about a rural town's police force trying to fight (imagined) communist insurgents using some rather ridiculous means.  It's all very slapstick, farcical.  Enjoy the book for its now dated (historical) view of South Africa, not for its paper thin story.<br />Bottom line: a very curious and funny piece of Sharpe's earlier works.  Certainly not his best, but he delivers the laughs.	2003-10-31

'Prayers for Rain' is my first Dennis Lehane book.  I now think I'll read the rest.  Why?  Unlike many of the popular crime/mystery writers of today Lehane can *really write* as opposed to just tell a good story.  'Prayers for Rain' should be considered literature by any standard.<br />In this book we have a couple of private investigators following upon the odd suicide of a young woman.  The more they dig into it the more strange things become.  Before long it all becomes a bit unbelievable yet the author is so deft at spinning this story that each little twist comes as an exciting surprise (as opposed to a groan of disbelief).  I should also add that much of the story is very violent, with some very cruel/sadistic moments.<br />But back to Lehane's writing ability.  The prose is uniformly excellent, and the characters are very well-developed.  Compared to the likes of Robert Crais and George Pelecanos, two authors I admire, Lehane is clearly the superior writer.  It was a complete pleasure reading 'Prayers for Rain'.<br />Bottom line: slightly over-cooked story aside, 'Prayers for Rain' and Dennis Lehane are definite winners.  Strongly recommended.	2003-10-27

'Virgin Heat' is certainly not one of Laurence Shames's better works.  Of course it has the funky Key West setting, as do all his books, and a host of kooky characters.  But the story, while initially engaging, falls flat long before the end.<br />In 'Virgin Heat' we have the (virgin) daughter of a mobster chasing after a long lost love in Key West.  Her man, unfortunately, is under a witness protection program for telling truths which put her father in the slammer for ten years.  Daddy is out of jail, daughter wants her man, ... and so on.  While there are humorous moments I felt the author got terribly repetitious on pointing out Key West weirdness, especially the very strong gay element.  Perhaps I should have been shocked by the thought of nude gay men hanging around a motel pool, and so the author harps on this point dozens of times?  Well I found it to be rather ... uninteresting, unfunny, and anything but shocking.<br />Bottom line: passable fluff for a beach read.  But very missable.	2003-10-24

But there is almost no plot, just and endless sequence of young Tokyo-ites getting stoned, puking, and having violent sex.  The characters are wasted youths.<br />But there is almost, *almost*, a charm to this book.  It does have a flow like something from Kerouac, and it captures nicely the lives of lost Japanese youths of the 1970s.  Yet it is such a bleak, *totally gross* read that I can't recommend it to anyone.  Instead look to *Haruki* (not Ryu) Murakami's works for a more palatable view of modern Japan/Japanese people.<br />Bottom line: weird, some curiousity value, but too vile to recommend.	2003-10-24

'The Sweet Forever' is one of several novels from Pelecanos based in urban Washington, this time in the mid-1980s.  The city is an absolute mess; violence, drugs and corruption reign supreme.  In this backdrop Pelecanos weaves a story of inter-racial strife, heartbreak, disillusionment, and despair.  Yes, this books packs it all in without appearing to be forced, preachy, or sentimental.  While most books from Pelecanos sort of delve into these areas in one way or another 'The Sweet Forever' really succeeds in every way.  [As you can tell, I really liked it. :-)]<br />But the book isn't perfect.  Without trying to explain its somewhat complex and interwoven story let me just say the ending seems to fit together just a bit too nicely.  I would have liked a least one loose end, which would a been a better reflection of reality.  The ending wasn't disappointing, but rather it could have been just a bit more powerful.<br />Bottom line: my favorite so far from Pelecanos after reading nearly of his books.

It is supposed to be the narration of an over-sexed pompous brat.  Yet the vocabulary used would confound most Mensa members.  Such intellectual arrogance wears thin after awhile despite some very humorous and touching moments.  It overshadows the good.<br />'The Rachel Papers' is about a rather snotty nineteen year old trying to get into Oxford University, circa 1970.  For some strange reason he documents the main characters of his life, including his love prospects.  And in walks Rachel, a somewhat more balanced individual who seems to have some surprises of her own.  Love (or near love), sex (very graphically detailed), and teenage trauma abound.  Martin Amis also throws in some rather good observations of teenaged angst.  But again, the overall style is one of intellectual arrogance.  A shame really.<br />Bottom line: a story about brat with a limitless ego and libido.  Good reading material?  No, not really.	2003-10-18

Sadly, it is far from his best material (my preference is 'The Woman Chaser').  Yet for those who have read 'Miami Blues', the first of the Hoke Mosely series, you'll undoubtedly want to read every one ... including 'The Way We Die Now'.<br />Hoke Mosely is a member of Miami's police force who is certainly a character.  While a seemingly fine police investigator he is a mess (personally, physically, emotionally).  He lives with his ex working partner and her baby, along with his two teenaged daughters.  As in most of the other Hoke Mosely books the plot primarily involves Hoke's personal life rather than any sort of crime mystery.  However in 'The Way We Die Now' the author takes Hoke to a migrant labor camp to sort out some rumoured atrocities, which I found to be very interesting reading, and Hoke also sorts out the mysterious death of a Miami doctor, a not-so-interesting subplot.  On balance this book is generally above average for the Hoke Mosely series but, as I mentioned above, is much less enjoyable than his early (1950s/1960s) noir novels such as 'The Woman Chaser'.<br />Bottom line: a fine conclusion to the Hoke Mosely series and Charles Willeford's career. He is missed.	2003-10-14

George Pelecanos is deservedly earning a loyal following of folks who like his urban Washington-based stories of crime, drugs, and residents who are sick of it yet can't escape.  Pelecanos obviously has a love-hate relationship with his hometown.  Yet after reading his books I fear most folks wouldn't want to get near it.<br />'Hell to Pay' is standard Pelecanos material.  His characterizations are uniformly excellent, the prose is intelligent yet accessible, and he really captures the 'feel' of the urban ghettos in and around Washington.  In this book we have a couple of private investigators, both former cops, involved with coping with brutal crimes close to their hearts.  Both wrestle with the temptation of revenge.  The reader has to wait until the last pages to know if these guys turn into vigilantes or manage to keep their own heads above the law.<br />Yet 'Hell to Pay' is not a perfect read.  While very enjoyable I found the plot to be surprisingly ... unengaging, or at least much of it fairly predictable.  Maybe I am just too much of a fan of George Pelecanos and I expect too much, or his style has become simply too familiar?  Regardless, 'Hell to Pay' is still a very good book.<br />Bottom line: not a classic, but a fine example of contemporary American crime fiction.	2003-10-13

Nearly all these true crime collections are a hodgepodge of stories, often unrelated, and too often unengaging.  &quot;A Fever In The Heart&quot; is ranked firmly in the middle; it is neither terrible, nor very good.<br />The main story is a curious one where &quot;male bonding&quot; takes an ugly turn.  The devotion between a wrestling coach and his underlings go WAY behind the norm.  This leads to a very unusual murder mystery.  However Ann Rule doesn't bother to sweat the details as she has done in her better books; it has a Reader's Digest feel about it.  And unfortunately, the half dozen or so other shorter stories which follow the main story are little more than gussied up police crime reports ... with relatively little literary merit.<br />But why do fans (like myself) continue to read Ann Rule books?  Quite simply, she has a very pleasent style to her prose.  It's both folksy yet intelligent and compassionate.  It's almost never a bad reading experience.  Unfortunately most of these her &quot;true crime files&quot; are hastily constructed and are rarely as good as her more in-depth, beefy true crime works.<br />Bottom line: very ordinary Ann Rule fodder.  She has done much better than this.	2003-10-07

Sure there is the quirky criminal characterizations Leonard is famous for, complete with some very funny moments.  But it seems that the author tried something a bit tricky by doing a Hollywood 'spin' on an Elmore Leonard novel and, well, the results are decidedly mixed.<br />In 'Get Shorty' we have the usual south Florida loan shark nasties out to get someone who does not want to pay.  This fellow lands a bundle on an insurance scam and runs to Hollywood.  One of the nasties (well, I guess he is reformed nasty) chases him down and gets involved with Hollywood luvvies (actors, writers, producers).  He then, ... here's the gimmick..., finds his adventures to be of more interest to film makers than another script originally being peddled to producers.  Anyway, it gets all a bit complicated and just a wee bit contrived.  Big disappoint to Leonard fans: the crime element to 'Get Shorty' is not the highlight of the book.<br />Bottom line: an unusual Elmore Leonard book which will probably not please his fans.  However its humour and digs at the Hollywood establishment make it a worthy read ... just.	2003-10-04

'Psycho' by Robert Bloch would most certainly be long forgotten and probably out of print if it weren't for its brilliant film adaptation.  Actually it is one of those unusual cases where the film is actually better than the book; the film's screenwriter (Joseph Stephano) did a great job.  So what does the book offer?<br />While all the major elements found in the film 'Psycho' are also in Robert Bloch's original novel I found the book to be relatively poorly written.  Great premise with a not-so-good execution.  For much better psychological/criminal character studies I recommend 'The Killer Inside Me' by Jim Thompson, or one of the many early works of Patricia Highsmith.  Robert Bloch simply doesn't have the same literary strength, and the characterizations are fairly thin.<br />However it is very interesting to note key differences between the film and the book, and so I believe fans of Hitchcock's film will enjoy reading Robert Bloch's novel.  At least it's a short read, the perfect sort of book to carry on business trip.<br />Bottom line: the book that spawned Norman Bates.  Somewhat disappointing but most will find some reading enjoyment from it.	2003-10-04

Lots of folks who are least able to afford it gambling money on races which always seem a bit suspect (ie, rigged).  And the horses are all in-bred, highly strung mutants of 'real' horses (animals which graze lazily over grassy meadows).  But Ms Hillenbrand sort of changed my perspective on all this, in large part to her boundless love of the sport - animals, jockeys, and trainers.<br />'Seabiscuit' is a non-fictional account of the life of a legendary racehorse of the 1930s, and all the folks who led this horse to fulfill its potential.  Laura Hillenbrand's research of events is worthy of a doctoral thesis yet, remarkably, it is very readable.  And she is obviously very compassionate of folks who throw their lives into horse racing, especially jockeys who literally risk their lives with every race. Very educational.<br />Bottom line: certainly one of the most enjoyable and accessible works of modern non-fiction.  Highly recommended to all.	2003-09-29

His works are a mixture of reality, fantasy and fairy tale.  'stardust' is no exception.  It is best described as a blend of 'Gormanghast' and 'Harry Potter'.  The former is a fantasy novel for adults, the latter more for children.  All take place in England, or someplace sort of resembling England.  All are about the dreams and fantasies of young men.  And thankfully, all are worthy reads in their own special way.<br />'stardust' is a romance story, chronicling the adventures of a young man seeking to retrieve a fallen star as a gift for his young love.  He embarks on a journey into a land of witches, unicorns, and other marvellous beings.  No spoilers here, but I will say the book is somewhat ruined by one fairly explicit (but not vulgar) love scene.  I say spoiled because beyond this scene 'stardust' would be perfect reading material for young teenagers.  As it is I would advise parents not to place it on their children's reading list.<br />Bottom line: classic Gaiman, which means very good fantasy reading material.  Recommended.	2003-09-25

He writes in a very literate yet street-wise manner.  His reflections of youth (in his home town of Washington) are poignant, and he throws in a fine crime story for good measure.  &quot;Nick's Trip&quot; is no exception.  Not classic Pelecanos but certainly a fun ride.<br />&quot;Nick's Trip&quot; is not a &quot;road book&quot;.  I think the title is somewhat metaphorical, describing the journey in life by a young private detective named Nick Stephanos.  He reflects on past friendships, boozing and life when he bumps into an old friend with a problem (missing wife, big money involved, etc).  He becomes more reflective when he calls for the aid from an old family acquaintance, someone well connected into local organized crime.  Then the adventure takes off.  A fast read, great characterizations.  And a real treat for 1970s music buffs.<br />Bottom line: one of several jewels by Pelecanos.  Recommended.	2003-09-22

His books are well written, and often hilarious (..using the same sort of Judaic satiric wit ala Joseph Heller).  And in 'Solomon Gursky...' we have a juicy premise: a Jew from mid-19th century travels to Canada and becomes a legendary figure among the Inuits, with his legacy felt over a hundred years later (in the twisted lives of his grandchildren).  Unfortunately I was overall disappointed with the book.  Why? ...<br />Well quite simply Richler has made the book far too grandiose in scope.  He introduces too many characters, too many disconnected scenes, and the overall focus of the story becomes clouded over long before the end.  While there are a good many interesting elements and characters to enjoy, and Richler's prose is as fine as ever, the book compares badly to his later works (such as Barney's Version).  'Solomon Gursky...' is a clear example of where less would have been more.<br />Bottom line: Richler goodness is largely wiped out by this overly long and complex saga.  For die-hard Richler fans only.	2003-09-19

His early works, such as 'Wild Wives', written in the 1950s is very much like the works of James Cain, David Goodis and Jim Thompson.  Greed, desperation, and violence of the poor and forgotten (, alcoholics, druggies, psychotics) provide the backdrop of psychological dramas/crime stories.<br />In 'Wild Wives' we have a San Francisco rarely employed private eye who is hired by a rich socialite.  Of course he finds this woman irresistable who, unsurprisingly, puts him on a course of  &quot;misadventure&quot;.  The woman we discover possesses many secrets (..no spoilers here), and Willeford treats us with a terrific ending.  The book is very enjoyable and wonderfully lean (packs a punch in only 100 pages).<br />Bottom line: an unjustly forgetten classic.	2003-09-16

Unbeknownst to most, he wrote a few terrifc 'noir' crime novels some forty plus years ago.  Thankfully they are now reprinted, as is the case with 'High Priest of California'.<br />This book contains both a novel and play of the same story, ... something one rarely finds.  The play is rather crude (read: not good) but the novel, albeit short, is quite effective.  It is about a used car salesman and his relationship with married woman.  Our leading made is a nasty S.O.B., and his lady friend is a bit ... unusual.  Combine this with a very breezy early 1950s San Francisco setting and one is left to enjoy this novella.  It reminded me very much of Goodis's 'Dark Passage' and Willeford's (better) 'The Woman Chaser'.<br />Bottom line: a nifty little 'noir' crime story.  A must read for Willeford fans.	2003-09-14

'Lust Killer' is one of Ann Rule's earlier true crime books.  It doesn't quite reflect the extensive character study of some of her later (and brilliant) works but it does contain perhaps one of her most frightening characters, a man who has a [hang up on] women's garments ... and a true hatred of women.  A deadly combination.<br />The female killing spree happened in Oregon some 30+ years ago but the story feels fresh.  This reader was amazed how such horrible atrocities could occur, commited by both a husband and a father.  It is unfortunate Ann Rule doesn't delve much into the killer's background, and indeed it seems the author didn't do her usual interviews of family members and related individuals.  So 'Lust Killer' has a somewhat abridged feel to it .. and it is indeed one of Ann Rule's shorter books.<br />Bottom line: ghastly killer, horrible murders.  Morbid yet fascinating.	2003-09-11

Despite its cover 'Turbulent Priests' has little to do with bedraggled young women who smoke.  It's actually a very cleverly plotted story about a young girl on a island off Ireland who is claimed to be the messiah.  A reporter is sent out to chronicle events and, to no surprise, all is not what they appear to be.  'Turbulent Priests' is fresh and funny.  It lamblasts both the (Catholic) church and Irish society in equal measure without taking it all too seriously.  Only the most sensitive will be offended (..although much of the language is crude).  I should also add that the book is rather Irish-centric.  Folks from outside Ireland/Britain might not understand much of the verbage or the sarcastic humour.<br />Bottom line: perhaps Colin Bateman's best book.  No small praise.	2003-09-10

'Last Dance, Last Chance&quot; is yet another of Ann Rule's collection of true crime stories, dominated by one major story followed by several smaller ones.  Personally I think these collections don't show off the author's skills very well, and they seem a bit formulaic ... yet Ann Rule continues to pump them out at a rate of one per year.<br />In this book the main story is about a very disturbed young doctor and his long suffering wife.  The man is not only a rotten physician but also a horrible husband/father.  After repeated failures at entering into specialized medicine he hangs a shingle in front of his office and instantly becomes a cosmetic surgeon (..from hell).  You can imagine the rest.  But you cannot imagine how this insecure, rotten individual takes out his frustration on his family.  Fascinating horror ... it can only be real.<br />Bottom line: enjoyable but not memorable Ann Rule material.  Yet surely her fans should and will read it.	2003-09-05

Janet Evanovich cranks out yet another installment of her very successful Stephanie Plum (&quot;bounty hunter chick from Jersey&quot;) series with 'To The Nines'.  For those who fear the series has run out of steam and has become, gasp!, boring ... relax.  Evanovich continues her comic writing ways and gives the reader what he/she is looking for: laughs and escapism.<br />But what about the story?  It is the usual Stephanie Plum nonsense.  Murder and mayhem in Trenton.  This time Evanovich becomes a bit more topical by throwing in internet stuff (yes, Stephanie Plum surfs the net), and her full-sized ex-prostitute sidekick Lola goes on the Atkins diet.  And Evanovich throws in a trip to Vegas for good measure.  However some of the enjoyable yet tiresome routines (Grandma's visits to funeral parlors, Stephanie's cars getting blown up) are thankfully absent.<br />Bottom line: not a memorable installment but certainly an enjoyable Stephanie Plum experience.

It contains both very memorable and rather forgettable stories.  All of them have the Haruki Murakami surreal touch; modern Tokyo on drugs (if you will).  Unfortunately the lead character in all his stories seem oddly the same, probably a thinly disguised version of Murakami himself.<br />Bottom line: no, not as good as his brilliant The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles.

'The Child in Time' has many of the hallmarks of a McEwan novel.  It is extremely well written, splendid characterizations, and it is a slow-paced read.  Full kudos on his use of written English but as with his other works, even the terrific 'Atonement', he seems to stretch what should be a relatively short piece of fiction into twice or three times its appropriate length.<br />However 'The Child in Time' is certainly an interesting read.  A young couple losses a daughter in a most traumatic way ... abduction.  We then live through its aftermath from the father's viewpoint (..the father character narrates the story).  The author is extremely sensitive and caring in the way he handles the the father's shock and ultimate recovery (..in a sense) of the situation.  A very well-observed analysis.<br />Bottom line: at times McEwan's over-elegant prose almost buries the keen psychological analysis of parental suffering.  Yet it's a most memorable read (even to single guys like me).	2003-08-25

'You Belong To Me ...&quot; is book #2 of a long series of true crime stories where one story is headlined and several short stories are stuffed in towards the end.  Overall these books do not have the depth nor the keen analysis work Ann Rule can produce, as she has done with some of her wonderful books ('Stranger Beside Me', 'If You Really Loved Me').  'You Belong To Me...' is definitely a middle of pack offering.<br />In the book the headline crime story is about a no good husband and cop who slowly 'loses it'.  Of course the end result is a brutal murder, no surprise here.  I had a personal interest in the story having lived in the region of central Florida where the crime was commited.  I fear others without such a personal connection might find all this to be very made-for-TV material.  Yet certainly those women who feel they are married to overbearing, horrible men might find this material rather interesting (..in a positive way).<br />Bottom line: I suppose this is disposable Ann Rule material yet it did hold my interest.  Passable.	2003-08-22

The wife is suitably bothered ... and that's it.  Nothing really develops.  The characters are uninteresting, seemingly rehashed buffoons from other Leonard novels.

Unknown to most Americans, Ben Elton is one of Britain's most successful comic writers (novels, plays, screenplays) today.  I thought a couple of his novels, 'Dead Famous' and 'Popcorn', were rather good; sharp, satiric and often funny.  So I greatly anticipated Elton's latest work, 'High Society', which raises the issue of legalizing all illicit drugs.  Yet unfortunately I was generally disappointed.<br />'High Society' is a collage of parallel and interwoven mini-stories involving a rock star (think Robbie Williams), an MP (think Jonathan Aitkin), and an assortment of substance abusers and misfits.  The MP is pushing for drug legalization legislation while the rock star, a heavy party guy, is tangentially recruited for the cause.  Everything gets a bit crazy when the media undermine both characters, with the rock star also falling in love and the MP falling in lust.  Towards the end everything turns a bit farcical.<br />While the author does do some clever associations of his characters to notorious folks (known mostly in Britain) I was disappointed that the discussion of drug legalization was not fully developed ... opportunity lost.  However the book has enough laughs to overcome any disappointment.<br />Bottom line: it could have been a contender.  Passable.	2003-08-16

'Career in C Major' is a surprisingly weak short novel by James Cain.  While it is not poorly written, the book's entire premise is utterly absurd.  We have a middle class, middle-aged man in 1930s New York City married to a posh, semi-neurotic wench.  The wife believes she has sacrificed a promising career in opera to get married and have children, and now wants to return to opera.  Okay, so far so good.  But then it turns out that the husband, without any singing background whatsoever, is a naturally gifted and reluctant Caruso who upstages his (very envious) wife!  I am surprised such nonsense was dished out by the normally wonderful Cain.  No doubt such rubbish was published only because of his reputation.<br />Bottom line: dreadful.	2003-08-10

After enjoying a few Laurence Shames novels, especially his wonderful 'Sunburn', 'Scavenger Reef' was a total disappointment.  While the story has some promise (exposing the hijinx of art collectors and dealers) it winds up being very uneven, and an often a tiresome read.  The characters are diverse yet completely unlikable, and I lost interest in the plot early on.

The story takes place in 1920s Los Angeles with the criminals being an insurance agent and a beautiful, wealthy wife.  Sounds trite?  In a sense it is, but the actual crime is very clever.  And James Cain milks the suspense wonderfully.  Unfortunately the books is very short, with the author skipping out on the details (background) of the main characters and their motivation for the dirty deed.  At times the book felt like a Reader's Digest version of a full novel.<br />Yet 'Double Indemnity' is a fine read.

'New Hope for the Dead' is one of Charles Willeford's comic-mystery novels starring Hoke Moseley, a crusty yet lovable member of the Miami police force.  It is hard to not enjoy the trials and tribulations of Moseley: work partner getting pregnant, his own love life on the skids, two teenaged daughters arriving at his doorstep, etc.  Always interesting; I never felt like I was reading the script to a soap opera.  However Willeford forgot to include a strong crime element.  Yes, there is a dead junkie and a sexy step-mom.  But the story itself compares badly to 'Miami Blues', a much superior Hoke Moseley novel.  And compared to Willeford's early masterpiece 'The Woman Chaser' one senses the Hoke Moseley series was not the best way for Willeford to end his career.<br />Bottom line: more of enjoyable literary junk food rather than quality stuff.  Recommended for Willeford fans only.	2003-08-03

Dick fans	Vulcan's Hammer is a very conventional early science fiction story about the future of the world dominated by a computer.  Naturally the humans catch on that this situation has drawbacks, and a rebellion is launched.  But with Vulcan's Hammer the computer doesn't take kindly to any encroachment on its reign.<br />Unlike the author's later works there aren't any deep-rooted social commentary with Vulcan's Hammer.  And this story is completely readable; I believe many Philip K. Dick fans enjoy deciphering his often unintelligible prose.  Best of all the story reads as a suspense novel, with the author deftly placing in twists to keep the reader hooked .. and it worked for me.  <br />Bottom line: a fun if somewhat unremarkable read.  Recommended.	2003-07-30

Yes, it has the same south Florida setting and similarly quirky characters.  But the plot fails to ignite, and the laughs are comparatively few.<br />In 'Mangrove Squeeze' we have big crime by the Russian mafia in small town Key West.  A nosey do-gooder from the local weekly newspaper gets herself in trouble with these guys, gets her boyfriend caught in the middle of it, and ... so the story goes.  As a previous reviewer has noted, 'Mangrove Squeeze' does pass the time rather nicely.  But otherwise it is forgettable in every way.<br />Bottom line: useful beach-reading material.  But you won't want to keep it on your bookshelf.	2003-07-28

When matched with a fine story, as with Atonement, one can easily say he is one of the best novelists around.  Unfortunately in Black Dogs the author chose to stretch what should have been a short story into a short novel, leading to barely passable results.<br />Black Dogs is based on the confrontation between a pair of wild dogs and a young woman, and its aftermath, shortly after WW II.  Beyond this rather frightening episode, with the fear factor captured beautifully by McEwan, we are led into a rather silly mish-mash of mysticism - eg, were these dogs some supernatural entities meant to represent something other than nasty canines?  Not being a particularly mystical person myself, I found all this to be a bunch of nonsense stretched to tedious proportions by the author.<br />Bottom line: generally a pleasurable read but McEwan has written much, much better.	2003-07-27

His latter works from the 1980s, such as Miami Blues, are a blend of crime/humour with a south Florida setting ... stuff that I like.  His earlier works from the 1960s/1970s, such as Cockfighter, are rather broodingly serious pieces ... stuff that I don't like.  The Woman Chaser is a very early piece from Willeford, written in 1960.  To my surprise it is by a wide margin the best of Willeford I've read.<br />Firstly, The Woman Chaser is not about chasing women.  The story is actually about a rather cruel, warped used car salesman who wants to break into films.  He abuses everyone to achieve his goal.  While this might sound like a trite story Willeford structures it very cleverly, and it is written in the style of Jim Thompson ... in the first person with brutal language.  Fortunately the book is not too depressing, and at times there is some humour.<br />Bottom line: a terrific little book by Willeford.  A must read.	2003-07-22

He almost always has interesting things to say but often it is shrouded in some incomprehensible storyline.  In one of his earlier and least known works, Dr. Futurity, we can both appreciate Philip K. Dick's imagination and not get bogged down with erroneous weirdness (albeit some would say it is this weirdness that makes his books so appealing).<br />Dr. Futurity has a fundamental theme of the 'Back to the Future' film series - namely, folks travelling forward/backward in time with hopes of altering the course of history.  In repeated time travelling episodes they actually see themselves from their previous journeys.  In Dr. Futurity the purpose of the time travel is to prevent the white supremacy era, as the author describes, which began when explorers conquered the New World.  In Philip K. Dick's twenty-fifth century all the human races are blended and babies are produced through careful selection.  Physically defective individuals are encouraged to get euthanised.  Now how this all relates to earlier centuries of white supremacy is unclear, but Philip K. Dick certainly takes us on a fun (if rather contrived) ride.<br />Bottom line: readable and enjoyable. Recommended for Philip K. Dick neophytes.	2003-07-20

Janet Evanovich writes an extraordinary successful series of funny crime stories starring Stephanie Plum, the bounty hunter who happens to be a babe.  While they should have universal appeal it seems that the publishers target them to women (..guys don't like buying pink covered books).  However I can now say I found the male equivalent to Evanovich's novels: Laurence Shames novels.  They are also funny, well-written stories with quirky yet likeable characters.<br />So what does Shames give us with 'Sunburn'?  Beyond the formulaic breezy comedic crime novel with a Key West setting he delivers .. shock!.. some rather dramatic and moving stuff (, without taking it all too seriously).  We have an aging crime figure who wants to dictate his life story to a sympathetic journalist.  Unfortunately both the FBI and others within the Mafia have an unhealthy interest in what is being written, and an especially stupid son makes matters much, much worse.  Without divulging spoilers, I simply want to say the author has structured and paced the novel beautifully.  The last fifty pages are especially good, exciting.<br />Bottom line: much better than his introductory 'Florida Straits', 'Sunburn' has made me a fan of Laurence Shames.	2003-07-20

He completely deconstructs the psyche of the pompous, self-righteous and arrogant British colonial rulers (diplomats) of Africa during the 1960s.  However I think even the most right wing British will not be offended with this book since his leading characters are so over-the-top buffoons and prigs it is obvious the author is writing a purely fictious comic novel, in the Tom Sharpe-esque tradition (but better written), rather than intentionally being cruel.<br />The story is about the travails of a junior British diplomat who is stuck in a nowhere African country and, despite wanting to succeed in his job/life, completely makes an ass out of himself.  This is made easier by having a nitwit boss, a local mistress with a social disease, and the knack of always putting his foot in his mouth.  The book is often laugh-out-loud funny.  And the author has done a marvellous job in structuring the book; it is well-paced and literate.<br />Bottom line: surely among William Boyd's best works.	2003-07-20

For fans for Elmore Leonard you already know he writes tight crime novels often strewn with humour and great characters.  And despite being largely formulaic in approach (..his lead characters all seem to be the same) he succeeds in entertaining the reader.  And the same holds true with 'Cat Chaser'.<br />With 'Cat Chaser' we have an ex-military guy in south Florida involved doing hanky-panky with the wife of a former monster from a Carribean country (Dominican Republic) before the Americans kicked him out.  The outcome is inevitable but along the way we meet strange characters (the usual Miami oddballs, and a few imports from the Dominican Republic) who do some very strange things.  While here are also a good number of funny bits Leonard is no match for the Florida comic crime novel master Carl Hiaasen.<br />Bottom line: a fun if not enthralling Elmore Leonard venture.  Fans will rejoice.	2003-07-13

Dick novels are an acquired taste, and I'm not sure if I've reached the point of fully appreciating the man's talents.  While never boring, it seems that he only lets 80% of the material to be logical and leaves the rest to the reader's interpretation/imagination.  This is sometimes fun, but often frustrating.<br />'The Man Who Japed' is no different.  Philip K. Dick paints a rather ugly picture of the USA some 100+ years in the future (after some nuclear holocaust).  The moral majority has run amuck, the Earth is pretty much trashed, and life is miserable for our leading character (an ad executive).  Sprinkle in some space travel and some mind-altering nonsense, typical of Philip K. Dick novels, and you have a rather fun if somewhat bewildering story.  The author's blasting of the moral majority alone is well worth the price of the book; it must have been a shock when it was first published (mid-1950s).<br />Bottom line: a worthy read, especially for fans of the author.	2003-07-08

And it is likely only Elmore Leonard fans would pick up the (relatively obscure) 'Unknown Man #89'.  This is unfortunate because most of the world will miss out on this compact jewel.<br />'Unknown Man #89' is one of those stories hard to describe without giving the plot away.  Broadly speaking we have con artists trying to make a fast buck off folks whom they thought would be total suckers.  Wrong.  Frustration and violence ensue.  While not winning any awards for originality 'Unknown Man #89' is very well written.  Elmore Leonard does a brilliant job on the characterizations, and the prose is very slick.  There is also some humour, albeit rather rude and crude.<br />Bottom line: certainly among Leonard's better efforts.  Recommended.	2003-07-06

Unlike seemingly all the amazon.com reviewers I found 'This Perfect Day' to be a disappointment, especially coming from the typically wonderful Ira Levin (..I've read most of his novels).  Perhaps it is because it deviates so much from his main literary themes (mystery/gothic stories) and delves into science fiction,.. and I am not especially fond of science fiction?  But no, I think it's because the storyline has been told before by others, and in a more accomplished fashion.<br />In 'This Perfect Day' we have planet Earth a few hundred years in the future.  Computerization and bio-engineering has really gone amuck, with humans acting and looking like androids (..I can see where Levin has taken this idea further with his 'The Stepford Wives', a much better book).  However not everyone is happy with this situation, with one person (the central character) looking to change things to the bad old days when people did as they wanted, not as they are programmed.<br />Again, despite some interesting moments I found 'This Perfect Day' to be relatively weak science fiction material.  I am surprised the other amazon.com reviewers, including Levin fans like myself, found it wonderful.  I think it is deservedly out of print, and not likely to be reprinted soon.	2003-07-05

'The Twenty-Seventh City' is my first experience of Jonathan Franzen.  Suffice to say it did not make me a fan.  While I can understand where some amazon.com reviewers found it to be a panoramic story of greed and corruption, I share the views of most reviewers who feel this effort was WAY over-blown, chaotic, and a depressing reading experience.  I was glad I finished it, and would have been happier not to have started it!<br />Okay, the story is about a corrupt police official in St Louis.  She comes from Bombay and brings along a host of criminals, junkies, and other misfits.  Naturally she is corrupt and terribly ambitious.  Challenging her are an assortment of St Louisans who are, well, only modestly corrupt but rather inept... this book has probably a dozen major characters with at least twice as many minor characters.  It's all very tiresome to keep track who is who, especially since many of the characters seem to have little impact on the story.<br />This book was not published in the UK for over a dozen years, not until Franzen became popular because of his 'The Corrections' ...  I can understand completely why UK publishers didn't bother with 'The Twenty-Seventh City' for so long, and I don't expect it will be reprinted here any time soon.<br />Bottom line: some decent prose but overall a dreadful reading experience.	2003-07-01

His earlier works were a mixed bag.  Competent, but no humour.  However since the 1980s Willeford has developed a sense of humour which matches his ability to crank out good crime stories, complete with memorable characters.  'Sideswipe' carries on in this tradition.<br />In 'Sideswipe' with have a violent ex-con, a disfigured ex-stripper, a retiree who just lost his wife, and a talentless artist caught up in some shenanigans.  Solving the caper is Hoke Moseley, our quirky cop from the novel 'Miami Blues'.  Actually most of 'Sideswipe' concentrates on Hoke and his odd family whereas the crime story itself is a relatively minor element to the book.  But overall it works well.  The overall effect is funny without being stupid.<br />Bottom line: competent and fun.	2003-06-27

However unlike Hiaasen Shames doesn't have any sort of political/social agenda.  He simply goes for laughs, and by enlarge succeeds nicely.<br />In 'Florida Straits' we have \\"stoopid\\" New Yorkers relocating to Key West.  As part of their baggage comes their crime family heritage (read: mafia).  Naturally some caper gets cooked up amongst the palm trees and, well, that's basically it.  Shames does treat us, however, with some very funny characterizations.  And he is compassionate with all the quirky folks who call Key West home.  However I did find his stereotype of Italian descent New Yorkers to be a bit over the top, especially in making fun of their rather curious accent.  It is one joke that he milked too hard and too often.<br />Bottom line: a fun yet rather brainless poolside read.	2003-06-21

'Any Human Heart' is the autobiography of a fictitious twentieth century literary character, Logan Mountstuart.  Despite his rather dodgy name, this character grows up into a rather interesting man.  It is especially his older life when he reflects upon disappointments and the overall value of his life does this book really catch fire - I found it to be most moving.<br />Unfortunately all is not perfect.  The author decided to &quot;be cute&quot; by having Logan Mountstuart be personal friends of famous twentieth century characters such as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Hemingway, and Virginia Woolf.  Some readers might find this to add extra spice to the story.  I found it exploitative and totally unnecessary - the book is solid enough.  At any rate this Forrest Gump-like diversions really don't spoil this fine book.<br />Bottom line: a very worthy read.  William Boyd is in fine form.	2003-06-17

He captures the absurdity of reality TV (\\"Big Brother\\") perfectly in this lighthearted murder mystery.  I think British readers will also relish his use of colloquial slang used by today's youths (whereas the American readers might be a bit puzzled).  My only complaint has to do with the characterizations: they are a bit too stereotypical, and their inane dialogue does grow tiresome.  However this is a book one must not take too seriously.<br />Bottom line: great fun.  One of Elton's better efforts.	2003-06-12

It starts off as a whimsical story of Indian teenager and his confusion about life, religion, and animals (his father is a zookeeper).  It is reminiscent of John Irving's &quot;Son of a Circus&quot;, and it bit like Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; but more fun.  The story then takes a much more adventurous turn when the boy and his family embark on a sea voyage to Canada.  No spoilers here, but what a fascinating story.  While a book for all ages I think &quot;Life of Pi&quot; will become a classic for the &quot;I am too old for Harry Potter, really!&quot; teenaged set.<br />Bottom line: simply wonderful.  Fully deserving of the Booker prize.	2003-06-09

While his stories are a bit far-fetched (as with \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", \\"The Boys From Brazil\\", and \\"The Stepford Wives\\") they are always entertaining.  His first book, \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\", is now largely forgotten (..it was written nearly 50 years ago) but seems remarkably fresh.<br />In \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" we have a a rich college girl and her gold-digging boyfriend in a dilemna.  The girl is pregnant and the choice ahead is grim: either get married and lose daddy's money, or risk an illegal abortion (remember this book takes place circa 1950).  She prefers the former, he the latter.  The outcome of this dilemna is unexpected (no spoilers here), and the story then really kicks into gear.  Yes, in true Levin form the plot is a bit contrived.  But it is deliciously readable.<br />Bottom line: strongly recommended.	2003-06-09

Yes, there is anger and frustration.  But the author's excellent prose elevate the stories beyond stereotype.  He is compassionate without making these characters into martyrs of white America.<br />Of course many will argue these stories are badly dated.  And true, America has moved on (generally for the better) since the early 1950s.  But it would be unfortunate to overlook these stories for this reason.  Baldwin captures the essence of where American society has come from, and we can all learn from history.  I also feel it is unfortunate that nearly all the  readers of \\"Going to Meet The Man' will be African-Americans, unlike myself (..who have the most to learn).<br />Bottom line: terrific tidbits showing Baldwin's brilliance.

'A Hell of a Woman\\" clearly falls right into Jim Thompson's turf: where a somewhat psychotic loser falls in love with Ms Wrong, then getting himself in deep trouble, and finally realizes that once again he hasn't moved forward in life at all (..but rather is worse off than when he started).  Like is famous/notorious \\"The Killer Inside Me\\", Jim Thompson makes clever us of first-person narration including little slivers of where our 'loser' tells us his inner thoughts.  Very chilling.<br />Bottom line: good story, well-written, fine characterizations.  No complaints.	2003-06-02

'Nothing More Than Murder' is nothing more than a short novel by Jim Thompson which chronicles the schenanigans of the small town cinema operator, a murder (no surprise here :-)) and its aftermath.  The book is at its best when after the murder everyone seemingly knows who is guilty and tries to extort money from the murderer.  And the book's ending is very good, creative (without being gross).<br />Unfortunately throughout the book the author gives us an exhaustively detailed lesson on the business aspects of operating a movie theater circa 1950.  While certainly those interested in the film trade from a historical perspective (... the world has moved on with the advent of multiplex cinemas and high tech video equipment), I fear most folks will find it tiresome.  I personally lost interest in it rather quickly.<br />Bottom line: lots of dull, overly detailed chatter almost spoils this story of murder and greed.  But, as with any Jim Thompson novel, it is still a worthy read.	2003-06-01

'Age of Iron' is typical Coetzee material in that it is extremely well written and portrays South Africa, in this case 1980s South Africa, as a very strange place where its national psyche is badly twisted.  In 'Age of Iron' the narrator is a elderly white woman dying of cancer.  Not only does she no longer understand her country she has trouble grasping the notion of life, death and in-between.  And then a homeless black man comes into her life (..she let's him in) and then she really starts pouring out here emotions.<br />On one level I really liked 'Age of Iron'.  Coetzee doesn't hold back on his brutal account of a country broken by apartheid.  And much of the dialogue between the dying woman and her homeless friend is most thought-provoking.  However the author has a tendency to over-cook the dialogue, stretching to the point of being a dissertation of all the evils of mankind.  It is as if Coetzee couldn't restrain himself from telling the world how smart he is.  Message to Coetzee: less would have be more, much more.<br />Bottom line: certainly an intriguing yet rather flawed novel.	2003-05-30

It seems that Jim Thompson's world of 1950s down-and-outs, alcoholics, criminals, and the mentally disturbed all come together rather nicely in this short novel, 'After Dark, My Sweet'.  The story can be encapsulated as: deranged ex-fighter meets alcoholic woman and her criminally minded ex-cop friend, with whom they all embark foolish on a big crime (no spoilers here).  As usual Jim Thompson captures perfectly the bleak ambiance, and the characterizations are spot on.<br />While the book is perfectly fine it is not in the league of the author's best works: 'The Killer Inside Me', 'The Getaway', and 'The Grifters'.  All these books are somehow special in terms of pathos, horror or surprise.  They are deserved to be called classics.  'After Dark, My Sweet' is not a classic, and I have no idea what the title means (..it has nothing to do with the story).<br />Bottom line: a worthy read, especially suited for Thompson fans.	2003-05-27

Like all his works this book takes place in Washington (, D.C.) and its characters are racially diverse, and into sex, drugs and rock & roll.  And unlike many of his books the story starts off with a bang, most literally (ie, a rather graphically described killing).  But then the book fails to take advantage of its early promise.<br />In 'King Suckerman' the author spends a lot of time, arguably too much time, on waltzing through 1970s memory lane.  Blaxploitation flicks and the music of the times dominate the book.  Yes, there are some nasty dudes in this book, lots of drug dealing, but before long we realize the author isn't going to deliver anything special.  George Pelacanos has done much better ('Shame the Devil', 'Right as Rain').  <br />Bottom line: the author seems to be into more of a nostalgia trip rather than writing a crime novel.  But for those craving a taste of pre-disco 1970s ambiance this book is \\"really baaad\\".	2003-05-26

'A Swell-Looking Babe' is typical of so many Jim Thompson books.  Its lead character is, to some extent, psychotic and finds himself involved with a big crime.  There is a woman involved who complicates matter.  And all the characters seem to fall into some forgotten sub-culture of the 1950s: the deadbeats, the boozers, and those who have forgotten even how to hope for a better life.  Ozzie & Harriet don't exist in Jim Thompson novels.  But will all this promise 'A Swell-Looking Babe' didn't quite engage this reader.  Why?  Well...<br />Without mentioning any spoilers, the reader is introduced to this \\"swell-looking babe\\" and gradually understands who she and why she means so much to the leading character (a young kid working as a bellhop).  Our leading character has a dark history with ... *unwholeshome* thoughts of women.  Yet just as the author begins to shock the reader he sort of pulls backs and tones down the book.  So any \\"oomph!\\" was quietly squelched.  A shame really since most of the book is crafted very cleverly, and Jim Thompson captures wonderfully the malaise of small-town American losers of the 1950s.<br />Bottom line: not a great example of Jim Thompson material but still intriquing.  Fans of this genre will probably get enjoyment out of it.	2003-05-25

Ann Rule has written some brilliant true crime books in the 1980s and early 1990s where she focuses on a singular criminal event, the criminal(s), victim(s), etc.  Then she changed her ways and pumped out several books which were little more than massaged police reports, with each report encompassing no more than 50 pages (..often much less).  So I thought Ann Rule resorted to simply cashing in on her success by dumping out inferior work with her name splashed on the cover.  But with 'Every Breath You Take' the author returns to pumping out an in-depth true crime story ... smart move Ann!<br />In 'Every Breath You Take' we have the story of a dysfunctional man who has a completely irrational hatred for one of his ex-wives.  This obsesseive hatred, of course, leads to no good.  Ann Rule shines in her analysis of this man, his ex-wive(s), and the aftermath of the (truly horrific) crime.  As with many of her books we see a deranged mind being the output of a lousy childhood.  <br />Bottom line: without question this book ranks among Ann Rule's better efforts.  Not a classic but certainly her fans will be pleased.	2003-05-22

The Getaway, The Killer Inside Me and The Grifters are amongst his famous and best works.  Savage Night is definitely not in the same class but it is a curious read nonetheless.<br />Savage Night is a story of how a thug/fugitive enters into the lives of those living in a small college town.  He is certainly a brutal character without any redeeming values (..the sort of characters often found in Thompson novels).  The story meanders a bit ... in fact there isn't that much of a story at all (some talk about doing a big crime, some hanky-panky with a married woman, a suspicious sheriff, etc).  But the most curious feature of Savage Night are the strange and memorable characters, most of whom are very dysfunctional and nasty.<br />I suppose my only disappointment with Savage Night is with what the other amazon.com reviewers consider to be an asset: its absolutely shocking ending...<br />Bottom line: weird almost to the extent of being surreal. But certainly memorable.	2003-05-15

If you haven't read any Roman historical fiction from Steven Saylor then I suggest you look immediately at the amazon.com reviews for 'Roman Blood', the first book in the series.  'A Mist of Prophecies' is best enjoyed only after reading Saylor's preceding novels.  For those who have had the pleasure of doing so please read on.<br />'A Mist of Prophecies' is a somewhat contrivedstory of an enigmatic soothsayer, aptly name Cassandra.  She enters the life of our Roman sleuth Gordianus (..actually, she and Gordy develop a \\"special\\" relationship).  In the start of the book we understand Cassandra gets poisoned. During the rest of the book Saylor makes clever use of flashbacks to understand what actually happened.  Saylor deliciously re-introduces all the evil ladies of Rome we got to know from previous books.  These ladies obviously took a shine to the fortune telling Cassandra.  Did one of them kill her too?  Read the book to find out.<br />Bottom line: slightly fluffy but extremely enjoyable.	2003-05-12

During the last ten years his writing skills declined due to poor health and opium addiction; some of his later novels are really bad (semi-theatrical melodramas).  Surprisingly 'The Haunted Hotel', one of the last works by Wilkie Collins, is a rather nice, compact ghost story.  Fans of Wilkie Collins will be pleased.<br />The story is about, um.., a haunted hotel.  Several characters, mostly squabbling aristocrats, return to the Venetian home (now hotel) of a deceased colleague (..a rather nasty fellow).  The past comes to haunt these guests in rather metaphysical ways.  It's all a bit silly, of course.  But the decent prose and characterizations save 'The Haunted Hotel' from being some camp ghost story.<br />Bottom line: certainly not a classic but enjoyable nonetheless.	2003-05-12

'Enduring Love' is the first McEwan novel I've read, and I was impressed.  He is one of the few authors (such as Margaret Atwood) today capable of writing truly beautiful, powerful prose.  Even with an imperfect story, as in 'Enduring Love', the reader simply wants to gobble up the words.<br />The story actually starts off very fast.  Several individuals are brought together in a compelling event (..an air ballooning accident), and a particular threesome are brought together in quite a destructive fashion.  Irrational, obsessive love of a young man threatens the stable relationship of a middle-aged couple.  At times scary, the story is very intriguing.  And as we learn in the end (in an Appendix) the story is loosely based on true events.<br />But the book isn't perfect.  I felt as though the author never really dug in deep enough on the characterizations, and dramatic moments were never fully drawn out.  This gives 'Enduring Love' somewhat of a \\"Reader's Digest\\" feel.<br />Bottom line: lovely words, interesting yet flawed story.  Recommended.	2003-05-05

The answer: yes.  But it could have been better, and I recommend the author injecting something new and exciting in the next installment.<br />'Hard Eight' is the usual pastiche of bounty hunter babe Stephanie Plum working herself out of ridiculous situations.  In 'Hard Eight' the author presents a rather straightforward and fun story involving a missing mother/daughter and the baddies who are chasing them.  And of course we are delighted with the nutty behaviour of the criminals, Stephanie's friends and her co-workers.  And yes, in 'Hard Eight' Stephanie finally consumates her friendship with Ranger.  While this should have been a hilarious episode the author oddly doesn't milk it for all the laughs it's really worth.<br />Bottom line:  sort of a \\"been there, done that\\" Stephanie Plum novel.  Not a classic but well worth the bother.	2003-05-02

'The Whirlpool' is an account of emerging middle class in London circa 1890.  With it comes all the social trauma of trying to find a balance between work, rearing of children, and leisure.  As with some of other Gissing's works he focuses more on the plight of the women wanting to be more than simple 'hausfraus'.  Their desire for personal fulfillment while still be super-wife and super-mom is probably true to the feelings of many women today.<br />However as 'The Whirlpool' chronicles the lives of select London families it does so at a very slow pace.  The dramatic moments are very prosaic.  Fortunately the narrative and characterisations make this to be a reasonably good read, especially for anyone interested in feminism and life during that period.<br />Bottom line: on balance a decent book.  However I recommend reading  Gissing's 'New Grub Street' to really appreciate his writing talents.	2003-04-28

Despite being written about 30 years ago the book is startlingly fresh.  While I think there has been some forgotten film adaptation made of this novel I should think film producers would be smart to take a re-look at this gem.<br />The plot?  The main story is about a bunch of Detroit gangsters looking to extort money from a independent businessman.  It seems they have some incrimminating photos of him caught \\"in the act\\" with his mistress.  But the plan goes horribly wrong thanks to the ingenuity of our victim-turned-hero.  Sounds contrived?  It isn't at all.  The author does a great job in creating very believable characters and capturing all the emotion and angst.  Formulatic in overall concept (criminal intent foiled by the victim) but remarkably original in its execution.<br />Bottom line: a terrific read.	2003-04-21

Everyone who reads 'Banco' does so because he/she was completely enthralled with 'Papillon' and are curious as to what happens to Monsieur Charriere.  But this reader was foolish enough to think 'Banco' would be as good as 'Papillon'.  Sadly, this sequel is a mere shadow of the original.<br />Why?  Firstly, the book is poorly structured.  The author bounces around quite a bit leaving discarding characters in its wake.  He is also too selective on what he wants to say about his life.  For example he does not tell us at all about his French wife even upon returning to France to meet with the rest of his family.  And the final fifty pages are an over-blown flashback to his original trial where he claims emphatically that he was framed, perjured against, etc.  After so many cries of \\"I'm innocent, really!!!\\" I'm beginning to wonder.<br />Still, overall I do recommend 'Banco' to those who have just finished 'Papillon'.  Just don't expect so much and you won't be disappointed.	2003-04-21

Despite all the wonderful amazon.com reviews of Papillon I had reservations about reading it. I typically find autobiographical books to be a thinly-disguised excuse for self-glorification. However thankfully Papillon does not follow this pattern. And a much bigger surprise, it is extremely well-written. The literary world would have been a better place if the author started writing books earlier (..perhaps when he was in prison! :-)).<br />If you've seen the movie Papillon then you have some idea about what the book is about. However the film adaptation is very watered down compared to the book. The book doesn't cease to amaze the horrors of prison life in French Guiana (in the 1930s) and the extraordinary efforts Henri Charriere went through to escape. I was shocked and heartbroken in equal measures. And although the author claims he was wrongfully imprisoned without really explaining the details it is clear he is no angel; he doesn't gloss over his weaknesses and failings.<br />Bottom line: a terrific tale of horror and triumph. Recommended for those, like myself, who typically hate autobiographical \\"love me I'm a hero\\" books.	2003-04-16

'Shame the Devil' is the last in a series of novels by George Pelecanos tracing the lives of Greek immigrants and their decendents living in downtown Washington.  While there is no need to read all the previous three novels, which I haven't done, I suggest reading at least one (perhaps the first, 'The Big Blowdown') to gain a historical perpective to the characters, the setting, etc.<br />'Shame the Devil' is very well-written, complete with excellent characterizations.  While it doesn't have much of the drug culture found in the author's other novels it does contain more than its fair share of violence, extreme sadistic violence.  The book drips with evil.  Simply put, the story is about revenge and redemption.  Certainly not in the same league as 'Crime & Punishment' but nonetheless a fine story.  My only criticism is that at times, especially towards the end, the author gets a bit soppy.  The good guy characters start hugging and snivelling.  Why the author chose to insert \\"Kodak moments\\" into this hard-hitting novel is anyone's guess.<br />Bottom line: George Pelecanos is really a terrific crime writer.  Enjoy.	2003-04-07

'Emma' is the first Jane Austen novel I've read in 20 years.  My earlier experiences (with 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility') were disappointing; they seemed to be overly genteel and without substance.  Was 'Emma' any different?  Er,.. no.<br />The first thing that grabs you about 'Emma' is that it reads like a play.  It is almost all dialogue.  No action, no flowing descriptions of the early 1800s England country ... just talk.  This makes for a very tiresome read.<br />Worse, the story (about a sweet young thing who busily plays matchmaker without any consideration of her 'victims' or her own love life) is rather [bad].  Any dramatic moments are very tame.  Emma's high society world is so devoid of emotion it is any wonder they bother living at all.  And in Emma's world there are no bad guys, no poverty, ... and no one seems to work for a living.  Think 'Ozzie & Harriet' transported back 150 years and plopped into rural England and you've got the idea.<br />So why bother with 'Emma'?  Purely out of respect for the author, and her legacy as one of the founding female writers of modern English literature.  She attempts, although not very successfully, in writing on matters other than soap operatic tosh (\\"gothic novels\\") her female peers did during that time.  True, other woman writers have since greatly eclipsed anything Jane Austen has done.  But she was the pioneer.  So please give at least one of her novels a try.	2003-04-03

The Spider's House is certainly not one of this author's better efforts.  Of course we have the usual Moroccan vs American/French culture clashes circa 1950.  But unlike his great The Sheltering Sky the author fails to tackle deeper, complex emotions.  In part this is perhaps because in The Spider's House the lead character is a young Arab boy, confused by the cultural pollution caused by the French ... and the impending battles for Moroccan independence.  Not only is the boy confused, the author seems confused in equal measures.<br />So while I think this book is an interesting snapshot of a turbulent Morocco I was disappointed in the meandering story.  The author also throws is lots of Arab and French words, either to give a sense of realism or to show off his intelligence.  I would have preferred if Mr Bowles had concentrated on writing a more engaging story.<br />Bottom line: best left to folks interested in demise of French imperialism in the 1950s and how a resident alien (the author) interpretes the local Moroccan psyche during it all.	2003-03-27

The actual plot is a bit hard to summarize but it involves our leading man, a disillusioned Japanese 'salaryman', being hired by a mysterious power broker to find a mystical sheep in the wilds of Hokkaido.  Of course the story is wacky, but it moves along nicely and it is very entertaining overall.  But in the end the story goes from strange to exceptionally surreal, even by Murakami's standards, and doesn't quite come together in the end.  I finished the book thinking &quot;what the heck was that all about ?!?!?&quot;.<br />But this book still has its plusses.  The translation by Alfred Birnbaum is excellent, and Murakami captures the essence of disillusioned Japanese youth *so well*.  Japanophiles will find much to enjoy (and learn) from this book.  But 'A Wild Sheep Chase' doesn't come close to Murakami's better efforts.<br />Bottom line: mondo weird.  Yokunai kedo aru teido omoshiroi. (Not very good but fairly interesting)	2003-03-19

George Pelecanos must really love or hate his home town of Washington.  He always seems to write about it, but what he writes about won't appear in any Chamber of Commerce brochure.  Druggies, organized crime, and ethnic violence seemingly permeate the lives of all Washingtonians.<br />\\"The Big Blowdown\\" departs from the author's other works in that much of it reads as a biopic.  We are given a \\"Reader's Digest\\" biography of a young Greek-American man raised in 1930s/1940s Washington.  While it is all not uninteresting even fans of the author will find it to be a prosaic.  Fortunately halfway through the book all the characters from this man's childhood come together for a very violent, and well-written, conclusion.  The author deftly tackles subjects like loyalty and personal ethics along the way.<br />Bottom line: despite its slow start this book ultimately comes together with \\"oomph\\".  Recommended.	2003-03-18

The setting of his novels, Morocco circa 1950, simply comes alive.  Thankfully in 'The Sheltering Sky' his writing ability is put to good use in a very moving story.  Unfortunately in 'Let It Come Down' the author falls short, and doesn't attempt to express the human emotions found in 'The Sheltering Sky'.  Having said this, most aspiring authors would kill to write anything as good as 'Let It Come Down'.<br />In 'Let It Come Down' we have a disillusioned young American escaping to Morocco and getting himself into all sorts of mischief.  The characters he meets are bizarre yet most fascinating.  It takes some 200+ pages, or two-thirds of the book, before the story takes any sort of direction.  'Let It Come Down' is touted as a thriller, and so you have some idea of what the last third of the book is about.  If it wasn't for the author's ability to write fine prose with brilliant characterizations this book would be a dud.  But instead it is a worthy read.<br />Bottom line: hardly the best from Paul Bowles, which means it is simply quite decent instead of excellent.	2003-03-13

'Deep Blue Goodbye' is the first of many Travis McGee mysteries, and it's my first John MacDonald novel.  And as I explain below, it will probably be my last John MacDonald novel.<br />Our story takes place in south Florida circa 1960.  Travis McGee is supposedly one of those lovable rogues that women adore and men envy.  He works privately in collecting stolen items for those not wanting to involve the law, and retains 50% commission.  In the 'Deep Blue Goodbye' he finds himself working for a woman who is trying to regain stolen articles of her deceased father, who in turn had stolen them himself during WW II.  The mystery itself unwinds nicely if fairly conventionally.  The author doesn't break new ground here; I got the feeling I've seen this all before on television or as a  composite of other mystery novels I've read.  <br />A so-so story can often be redeemed by fine writing and/or characterizations.  But other than capturing a good feel of a Miami long forgotten, MacDonald's literary skills are just average.  I found the Travis McGee character to be especially contrived.  MacDonald was probably looking to develop him as an 'enigmatic' character.  I simply found everything about him to be phony, perhaps as some alter ego of the author.<br />Bottom line: certainly passable entertainment, but nothing more.	2003-03-05

Even though 'Ham on Rye' is listed as a novel it is also well understood to be a thinly disguised autobiography of the author's early life (until his early 20s).  This worried me since I don't like autobiographical material because its singular focus on the author.  Having said all this, 'Ham on Rye' is such a detailed horror story that, like looking at an auto accident, you can't help but be drawn in.<br />Our main character is raised during the depression by an absolutely horrific father and doormat of a mother.  The guy is also plagued with a complexion from hell, and seems to be in a bad need of a hug (yet no one wants to get near him).  Besides he completely fights off anything that resembles affection or friendship.  Not surprisingly this dysfunctional young man grows into a dysfunctional adult.<br />What makes this book distinctive is the author's rather decent writing skills and his complete lack of self-pity.  The story is heartbreaking but the main character carries on, like a stray mongrel wandering the streets.  Depressing, terribly depressing.  But it is a story that should be read, especially by fathers who never spare the rod lest he spoil the child.<br />Bottom line: sometimes depressing books should be considered as mandatory reading material.  This is one of them.	2003-03-02

In his Discworld series he has carved out a niche in the massive world of science fiction/fantasy novels: absurdist science fiction.  His alternative world, which sort of resembles Earth (complete with humans), contains a wealth of nutty creatures.  And Pratchett's narrative, while very simple, has many funny bits.  But for this reader, and probably many others as well, his works are way over the top ... and tiresome.  Fortunately 'Moving Pictures' seems to be amongst his better efforts.<br />'Moving Pictures' is the story of how Hollywood (in this case 'Holy Wood') comes to Discworld.  The author takes tremendous liberty in poking fun at show business, often to good effect.  Double entendres abound.  At no time does the author take the story seriously, which eventually make this reader lose interest before the end.  But kudos to Mr Pratchett for taking on a delicious subject matter and making the best use of his talent (ie, humour).<br />Bottom line: perhaps one of the few Pratchett books that will appeal to his detractors.	2003-02-28

Requiem\\", Robert Crais writes in a tight yet fast-reading style which simply makes the pages fly by.<br />In our story we have a police heroine who leads the charge in finding a serial bomber ('Mr Red').  The story has *plausible* twists and turns, with an unexpected and thrilling ending.  And the author has seemingly done a fine job researching this bizarre world of bombers and bomb disposal experts; I found it educational.<br />However 'Demolition Angel' isn't perfect.  Robert Crais is a great storyteller, but he isn't a great writer.  His characterizations are somewhat shallow, and he expends no effort in giving the reader the *feeling* of the setting.  It is as if he wrote the book in haste.  But these are mere quibbles.<br />Bottom line: terrific (and frightening) story.  Job well done.	2003-02-24

I am convinced Tom Robbins is a brilliant, funny guy (..the type who would make a great dinner companion) but a lousy writer.  I was hoping for better after reading his 'Still Life with Woodpecker', a book with some interesting elements but a disappointment overall.  Unfortunately 'Even Cowgirls...' was very similar, and decidely worse.<br />'Even Cowgirls...' is the story of a beautiful girl (Sissy) with enormous thumbs.  Making maximum use of her assets, Sissy literally becomes a hitchhiking American wonder.  Along the road of life she hooks up with a rich benefactor (Countess), who has made his reputation by selling feminine deodorant, a Japanese-American sage/hermit ('the Chink') living in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and a bunch of 'ladies' working on a ranch.  The story is all very silly, with humorous and touching moments sprinkled about.  It certainly isn't a believable story, but this wasn't the author's intention.<br />However by far the worst aspect of 'Even Cowgirls...' is the author's incessant personal monologues he interjects on seemingly every other page.  He pontificates life, love, the universe, etc.  He is clever and insightful, yet often childish and obnoxious.  I especially don't like his views of women.  Oh, Mr. Robbins certainly loves women.  But what is the point of referring to the female sexual organ as a 'vertical smile and then showing us drawings of this 'smile' at several locations in the book?  Very immature.<br />In truth 'Even Cowgirls...' starts off rather good.  But then halfway through it I knew it was going downhill when the author (Tom Robbins) introduces us to Sissy's psychiatrist, a Mr. Robbins!  This must clearly be the sign of an author who simply wants to fill pages with self-glorifying tripe.<br />Bottom line: despite some humorous and well-observed moments this book is a bomb.  Best avoided.	2003-02-21

Dan Starkey, a less than semi-talented journalist, is brought along to document the Irish fighter's American experience.  Things get interesting when the fighter's wife gets kidnapped and a black extremist group is suspected.<br />Colin Bateman makes good use of his humourous prose; he has great (and often crude) one-liners.  He makes good fun of Americans and the Irish of all persuasions.  I think only the most sensitive will be offended.<br />Bottom line: lightweight but very funny.  Recommended.	2003-02-20

In yet another installment of Ann Rule's collection of true crime stories we see Ann Rule at her worst.  Well I should say that at her best Ann Rule does a brilliant job of analyzing criminals, victims, crimes and the US justice system.  She has the knack of drilling down into minute detail without being boring.  However with 'Empty Promises...' the author doesn't go into any detail and, worse, the stories she relates are your basic slasher crimes; we've seen them all before (and were grossed out).<br />At the very least Ann Rule still writes in a very readable, personable sort of way.  So the book is a painless waste of time.  If Ms. Rule reads this review can I ask her, as a loyal fan, to dispense with these half-hearted stories (as an attempt to cash in on her name?) and give us more classics like 'If You Really Loved Me' or 'Dead By Sunset'.<br />Bottom line: Ann Rule on a very off day.  Don't waste your money.	2003-02-10

In this installment we have the suspicious death of former rock start being investigated by an obituary writer from a local newspaper.  It is silly without being stupid, and it comes with many funny one-liners.  However unlike Hiaasen's better works (such as 'Skin Tight') the book's satiric bite is somewhat lame, and the kooky characters aren't particularly memorable.  So it seems 'Basket Case' doesn't rise above the middle ranks of Hiaasen novels.  But it certainly is enjoyable enough.<br />Bottom line: okay, but perhaps best left to true Hiaasen fans.	2003-01-30

On one level it is a comedic love story between, if you can imagine, an exiled princess and a terrorist.  On another level it is a surreal, existential pile of nonsense.  Beyond this the author regularly pauses the story with vignettes of his philosophy on life, love, and all that stuff.  Does it all work?  No, not for this reader.<br />Well actually I do like the author's sense of humour, and the love story is deranged yet charming at the same time.  However unfortunately the author interjects some immature and vulgar elements, especially concerning sex and the female anatomy.  And all this existential blathering almost ruins the entire book.  Thankfully the cute ending salvages it ... almost.<br />Bottom line: a very weird book.  In this case 'weird' doesn't mean 'good'.	2003-01-27

'Right As Rain' is my first taste of the writing talents of George Pelecanos.  I expected a moderately enjoyable yet forgettable crime novel.  But I 'Right As Rain' is much more.<br />George Pelecanos is from Washington DC, the setting of 'Right As Rain'.  He captures the social difficulties of this racially mixed city, a city filled with murders, drug peddlers, and a few bent cops.  The story is an exciting yet plausible one about a private investigator who is out to unravel the mystery as to why a white cop killed a black cop.  Was it self defense or a racially motivated murder?  The results are unexpected and totally satisfying.  However it's the author's excellent characterizations and fine writing skills (prose) which makes 'Right As Rain' a modern crime classic.<br />Bottom line: a very memorable crime story.  Recommended.	2003-01-24

Now I know more than I thought possible, which I guess is a good thing. :-)  Thankfully Charles Willeford's cockfighting education manual is actually a darn good read.<br />Cockfighting is gruesome, and Willeford does not sanitize the sport in any way.  In a rather balanced way he describes cockfighting and cockfighters.  The main character in this novel is obsessed in winning the 'super bowl' of cockfighting.  He lives for cockfighting.  Quite honestly, it's a rather depressing existence.  Thankfully Willeford's attention to detail rises just above the boredom level.  And the ending is very exciting indeed.<br />Bottom line: certainly not a book for everyone. Yet it's compassion to this nasty blood sport should be lauded.	2003-01-14

I wish I can give 'The Burnt Orange Heresy' the same sort of glowing review the others have posted.  However despite its originality (at the time it was written) and overall quality I found myself curiously bored by it all.  Why?  Well...<br />The story is certainly bizarre.  A rather obnoxious art critic is obsessed with getting a glimpse of paintings by a living art legend who happens to be a recluse.  No one has seen this fellow's work in decades.  Our art critic will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  Think deceit, betrayal and murder and you've got the right idea.  Sadly, I think such art critics actually exist in this world. ;-)<br />But Willeford unfortunately devotes too much time during most of the book blathering on about the art world: competitiveness between critics/reviewers, different styles of art during the last century, and how to judge the quality of art.  For this reader, who couldn't give a monkey's about art, became quite bored with it all.  Towards the end when the story picked up I was too disengaged to really appreciate the shock/horror of our art critic from hell.<br />...Bottom line: perhaps best left for those who truly hate art critics and love Charles Willeford.	2003-01-12

It is actually a very depressing account of an alcoholic who finds love (..er, or something like it) with another alcoholic in the seedy parts of San Francisco circa 1965.  The story is a about drink, drunken behaviour, and despair.  Towards the end the story does &quot;pick up&quot; (no spoilers here) but by that time this reader was so depressed by it all that I felt more bored than engaged with the story.<br />'Pick-Up' is by no means a poorly written story.  The characterizations are fine but perhaps a bit thin (..well, it is a short novel).  However there are a great many films/novels which address alcoholism better than this book.  It is by no means amongst Willeford's better efforts; it falls way short of his 'Miami Blues' written many years later.<br />Bottom line: competent but unengaging.	2003-01-11

Don't let the main theme (about a Greek-American hermaphrodite and her family) make you think this is some exploitative trash.  On the contrary it is a warm, compassionate story full of life.  And the characters are portrayed so well you'll wish Jeffrey Eugenides would write your life story.<br />Caveats?  Bad points?  No.  None.  Zero.  This book took the author nine years to write and it shows.  It easily eclipses his first book (The Virgin Suicides) in terms of scope and quality, which is quite a feat (I enjoyed The Virgin Suicides very much).<br />Bottom line: a book 500+ pages in length that makes you cry out for more.  I hope Eugenides is already working on his next book.	2003-01-08

'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle', a surreal materpiece, remains his best.  However I found his most famous 'Norwegian Wood' to be too sentimental for its own good.  Thankfully with 'Sputnik Sweetheart' the author has found the right blend of the surreal and the romantic.  I loved it.<br />'Sputnik Sweetheart' is about an odd love triangle where the love is either platonic or something a bit stronger yet unfulfilled; there is no sex in this book.  Murakami, with no doubt significant credit to the translator, excels in expressing each of the unique character's loneliness without being too depressing.  Cerebral without taking itself too seriously.  And as for the surreal element ... it works very nicely (no spoilers here!).<br />Bottom line: a elegant piece of modern literature.  Read it.	2003-01-02

David Goodis is the champion of the down-and-outs, druggies, boozers and misfits.  In 'The Moon in the Gutter' we have an interesting story about a stevedore (dock worker) and his utterly miserable existence.  He has difficulty in coming to grips with the grisly death of his sister, his home life is a disaster, and his future looks bleak.  But then he meets a blonde from the other side of the tracks and ....<br />While I won't give any spoilers here let me just say I felt very let down by the ending of this novel.  David Goodis brings the reader into the life of this poor soul and shows us his world without compassion.  Towards the end the tension builds (..again no spoilers) but the author fails miserably in tying it all together at the end.  Very disappointing.<br />Bottom line: a missed opportunity by Goodis.  Intriguing, but best left to Goodis fans only.	2002-12-30

'Dark Passage' by David Goodis, perhaps best known by the film adaptation (starring Bogart and Bacall), is the best of several David Goodis novels I've read and yet, most puzzling, it is the only one presently out of print.  I can certainly recommend searching far and wide for a used copy because it is an excellent example of 1940s crime 'noir' writing, as good as anything Chandler, Cain or Thompson have dished out (and these authors have all written great stuff).<br />In 'Dark Passage' we have an escaped con in San Francisco.  He gets involved with a mysterious young woman who helps him in both staying on the run and finding out who indeed did the crime (the murder of his no good wife) for which he was falsely accused of.  The book is written in the first person (..in typical Goodis fashion), and so we get \\"under the skin\\" of our leading man.  Perhaps in this book (compared to the others I've read) Goodis does the best job of interweaving strange characters into a plausible story, with the end result being an ending which is both surprising and gratifying.<br />Bottom line: a must read if you can find a copy.  Brilliant.	2002-12-29

Steven Saylor is known for his fine (Roman) historical detective series.  However with the unfortunately titled 'Twist at the End' (..known as 'Honour the Dead' in Britain) Saylor spins a mystery fable based in his home town of Austin (Texas), circa 1885.  He has cleverly recontructed a story surrounding a series of true crimes: the brutal murders of young women over a two year period (..in fact these crimes were never solved).  Saylor makes use of some infamous/notorious late 19th century Austin residents to embellish his story.  Sadly, these embellishments completely ruin any sense of believability; this is a major &quot;no-no&quot; with any piece of historical fiction.  And as other reviewers noted, despite its title no one will find a &quot;twist at the end&quot; here.<br />But all is not lost.  The prose flows very well, and the characterizations have some depth to them.  I actually enjoyed 'Twist at the End' for its snapshot of 1880s Austin life.  Folks interested in Texas history will appreciate the author's obvious detailed research.<br />Bottom line: certainly a half-baked mystery novel.  But the overall writing talents of the author and historical perspectives make 'Twist a the End' a surprisingly decent read.	2002-12-26

True to form, Goodis focuses on a single character and his angst.  This time we have a man who has difficulty remembering the details of his involvement with $300,000 taken in a bank heist.  On his tail are the bank robbers and the police.  One fully appreciates this man's plight.  However this alone didn't capivate this reader.  Why?<br />Authors like David Goodis and Patricia Highsmith who specialise on suspense and apprehension of a leading character (typically a victim or a criminal) succeed when there are additional characters and/or circumstances that 'fill out' the story.  However 'Nightfall' is really a one-dimensional story.  The author fails to build on an interesting sub-plot involving a police detective, with the help of his wife, chasing our poor central character.  Before long I found 'Nightfall' to be a tedious read.<br />Bottom line: certainly a must read for those into 'noir' fiction.  Others will probably find it too dark, depressing and claustrophobic.	2002-12-23

'Family Dancing' is a collection of short stories written by David Leavitt when he was in his early twenties.  It is remarkable thata young man can write with such sensitivity.  The prose is very fluid, and the characterizations are quite realistic.  Quite remarkable considering these are *short* stories, not novels.  However these stories are somewhat uneven in their overall quality, and I think I know why.<br />David Leavitt is best known for writing gay fiction.  In 'Family Dancing' about a third of the stories are gay-themed.  But I find the gay characters in these stories, and even in his fine novel 'The Lost Language of Cranes', to be very two-dimensional.  However Leavitt's observations of parents coping with dysfunctional lives, marriages, and children to be most affecting.  In 'Family Dancing' there are a couple of simply wonderful, extremely moving stories about people living with cancer.  These stories alone are worth the price of this book.<br />Bottom line: a mixed bag containing treasures.  Recommended.	2002-12-22

The man simply pumps out farcical stories which polk fun at the establishment and wealthy folks in particular.  As with most farces, the reader can either find it all to be hilarious or simply stupid.  Fortunately this reader found it to be hilarious.<br />'Blott on the Landscape' is about one woman's fight to keep her ancestral home at all costs, with the help of her gardener (Blott).  We are exposed to the most improbable characters and actions imaginable, with rude behaviour and language in abundance.  It all has a 1970s British television sitcom feel about it.  Still I think most Brits will enjoy this book, and fortunately it is still in print over here.<br />Bottom line: Tom Sharpe in fine form.  I'm still giggling.	2002-12-22

While the others in the series focus on one main story followed on by shorter stories, this book only contains short-ish (30-50 pages) stories.  And so we don't have the pleasure of Ann Rule's great research and insight, as found in her single story books (eg, 'Dead By Sunset').  It is as if the author didn't want to sweat the details and simply wanted to tart up police reports, and then stuff them into a book.<br />Having said all this, Ann Rule does write in a very fluid style.  Her books are always a fast read.  And while the stories here are most definitely morbid and horrific, they are fascinating (much like viewing a road accident).<br />Bottom line: empty calories for the brain.  But like junk food, hopelessly addictive.	2002-12-15

His caustic sense of humour, his self-deprecating look at life, and his sometimes thinly disguised autobiographical stories are always memorable.  Imagine Joseph (Catch-22) Heller being from Montreal and you have Mordecai Richler.<br />Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is one of Richler's earlier and better known (..thanks to the 1970s film adaptation) works.  The story centers around a young Jewish teenager (Duddy), a very abrasive and aggressive boy, striving to make money in order to buy land (thinking, like his grandpa, that if you don't own land you ain't nuttin').  So Duddy gets into a strange, and hilarious, film-making business.  His pushy and obnoxious behaviour both appalls and endears everyone he meets; I too was appalled and endeared.  By the end of the book I felt I knew (but didn't like) Duddy.<br />While I did enjoy 'Duddy Kravitz' I have to say it certainly isn't Richler's best effort.  I suggest Barney's Version, written some 30 years later, which demonstrates the author's abilities at his peak.<br />Bottom line: an endearing story of a lost youth in Montreal circa 1950.  Fondly memorable.	2002-12-12

It is hard to believe that a 20 year old university student can produce such sumptious prose in his first novel ('The Drowning People').  The words flow beautifully.  Not only is it an effortless read, the prose is on par with the best of today's fiction writers.  So yes, I loved this book.  However the story itself isn't exactly flawless.<br />The story is a about a love triangle (actually, a quadrangle) set in modern London.  A talented violinist falls in love with a troubled young woman with a bizarre past.  The bane of this woman's existence is her identical cousin (..hmmm, sounds like 'The Patty Duke Show').  Further complicating matters is the relationship of a (very close) male friend.  Sounds like a soap opera?  Well, it actually works better than it sounds.  A bit contrived, but thanks to the prose it is all compulsive reading.<br />Bottom line: a fantastic debut of a promising writer.  Recommended.	2002-12-10

Most folks know The Thin Man for the famous 1930s/1940s film series about detective Nick Charles and his socialite wife Nora.  The films are known for being breezy and comedic rather than for the actual plot, which typically involves a murder mystery.  The original novel The Thin Man is certainly of this mold, which for some might be perfect but for others (like me) a bit disappointing.<br />In The Thin Man we have our handsome couple tinkling champagne glasses in 1930s Manhatten.  Our reluctant detective is asked to sort out some shenanigans of a former client, and his very dysfunctional family.  We are entertained by cameo appearances of thugs, crooks, and Asta (the family dog).  It is all very cutsie without being too silly.  However fans of other private detective novels of that genre, especially the Philip Marlowe stories by Raymond Chandler, will find The Thin Man to be too ... thin.  No sparkling dialogue, no real nasty characters, ... no \\"oomph\\".<br />Bottom line: painless reading.  But see the film, forget the book.	2002-12-06

The Boys From Brazil is probably better known by its late 1970s screen adaptation than the novel by Ira (\\"Rosemary's Baby\\") Levin.  Since I hadn't seen the movie I thought I'd give the book a try.  And I was pleasently surprised.<br />The story is about elderly Nazis in Brazil, led by the ingenius yet wicked Mengele, seeking to clone Hitler.  In fact they had done this some years back, cloning 94 genetic equivalents of bad ol' Adolph.  Now in the mid-1970s they need to embark on a murderous rampage to fulfill their objectives (..no spoilers here).  Bring in an aged Nazi hunter from Vienna and we have a tight, compulsively readable little thriller.<br />Of course we know really that the story deep down is very contrived, even for when it was written (1970s).  So I recommend not taking the story too seriously.  It is well-written, and there are a couple of most memorable scenes.<br />Bottom line: bio-terrorism and Nazis.  Turn off your brain and enjoy.	2002-12-02

To his credit the author breaks away, if only slightly, from his proven yet over-exercised formula of legal dramas.  The Testament branches out into areas of morality, religion and greed.  On balance the author succeeeds in capturing the reader's attention.  I liked the book despite myself.<br />The beginning of the story starts off very well. The death of a multi-billionaire/monster is eagerly awaited by his completely dysfunctional children and ex-wifes.  The rich geezer is looking go to the hereafter with his malicious streak intact.  After his death a legal battle takes place, and the hunt for the man's illegitimate daughter ensues.  The trail soon leads to the jungles of Brazil (think snakes, bugs, disease).  Okay so far.<br />But then one of the lawyers becomes wrapped up with this daughter's belief in God, her self-sacrificing existence, and within a matter of days his entire life, albeit a pretty miserable life, is reformed.  Contrived?  Yes.  Does it ruin the book?  No, not especially.  But such life-transforming dramas are best left to more talented writers than Grisham.  And the entire adventure in the wilds of Brazil was surprisingly well done.  Perhaps Grisham should write adventure stories instead of going for the deep, human values stuff?<br />Bottom line: an enjoyable if uneven novel.  Grisham fans will not be impressed.  All others should find it entertaining.	2002-11-28

His \\"baddies\\" are crooked politicians, corrupt businessmen, rascists, polluters and the media.  His good guys are invariably simple, easy-going folks just trying to live a happy life but are being thwarted by the baddies.  In the end the good guys win. I should add that his stories are always set in Florida, most often in wild Miami.  Most importantly, Hiaasen has a very wicked satiric sense of humour; it's this laugh-out-loud quality that makes his books bestsellers.<br />In Lucky You we have a couple of baddies (rascist rednecks), owners of a winning lottery ticket, out to double their earnings by stealing the other winning ticket.  Their criminal intent is enhanced when they learn the owner of the other ticket is a black woman.  Of course this woman, with help of her friends, becomes a formidable opponent.  The story is enhanced with some very bizarre and hilarious vignettes of Florida weirdness: a corrupt judge, religious fanatics who see the image of Christ (and apostles) in the most curious places (eg, in an oil stain on a major highway), and a Hooter's waitress with brains to match her looks.<br />Bottom line: among Hiaasen's better efforts.  A true giggle-rama.	2002-11-25

Each book contains a major true crime story, well-researched in the Ann Rule fashion, followed by summaries of lesser chronicled crime stories.  I personally prefer Ann Rule's other books which cover only one story but in enormous detail.  Some of these classics (eg, 'The Stranger Beside Me') make for truly chilling yet enjoyable reading.<br />The main story in this book is also title 'A Rose For Her Grave'.  It is about a man who murders his wifes to collect on insurance money.  Most surprisingly, the man is not some dream hunk ... just some sub-standard car mechanic.  And his personality is a bit bizarre, frightening.  Yet women seem drawn to him.  Fascinating reading.  The other stories in the book are grisly affairs, sort of &quot;quick hit&quot; murders on unsuspecting victims; the victims did not know their killers.  Compulsive yet uncomfortable reading.<br />Bottom line: fine true crime reading enjoyment.  Recommended.	2002-11-20

It is hard for me to understand how so many amazon.com reviewers apparently enjoyed Snow Falling on Cedars. I had difficulty in finishing this ho-hum mystery enveloped in a \\"the Japanese are really beautiful people and Americans are rascist brutes\\" package. David Guterson's knowledge of the Japanese is obviously weak, and his writing talents overall are also weak.<br />The premise is actually rather good. We are placed back into the 1950s on a small island near Seattle. The community is very small, with a sizable number of Japanese immigrants. Of course coming off WW II racism abounds. A young Japanese man is accused of killing a boyhood friend on a fishing boat. We are then exposed to, in a series of flashbacks, the lives of these men and the community overall which lead to this death. Unfortunately the author fails badly on executing the story in a credible fashion.<br />The author portrays every person of Japanese descent in an ignorant, sterotypical fashion. They are family oriented, stoic, peaceful and proud. We are to feel sorry for how brutally they were treated in internment camps and by American society on the whole. However these are such gross generalities. The author fails to mention that the Japanese people of that era were far more rascist, and brutal, than Americans. Any Americans caught in Japan during WW II wouldn't have been happy, assuming they were permitted to live. I found the author's \\"American bashing\\" at the expense of the Japanese to be very ... crude. [I am not anti-Japanese; I lived there for years.]<br />As for our intriguing murder mystery,.. it was anti-climatic.

I remember the film Miami Blues (with Alex Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh).  I enjoyed it and hoped the novel would be at least half as good.  Thankfully it was even better than the film.<br />In Miami Blues we have a young psychopathic criminal from California landing at Miami International Airport.  All he wants is to steal enough money to live on easy street, and he will not let anything get in his way.  Unfortunately bad luck and stupidity are stacked against him.  Worse, he partners up with an incredibly sweet yet dumb local girl who doesn't offer value for achieving his goals ... no matter how he manipulates her.  Worse still, there is a rather crusty old cop out to get him.  No spoilers here, but suffice to say Miami Blues has a good ending.<br />The best part of Miami Blues is Willeford's excellent capturing of the \\"feel\\" of Miami.  It's very much like Carl Hiaasen material without the caustic satire (..oh, I should add Miami Blues does have funny bits also).  And it doesn't take itself too seriously, as if Charles Willeford wasn't planning to write fine literature but simply a good story.  He succeeded very nicely.<br />Bottom line: a minor jewel amongst the masses of mystery novels.  Recommended.	2002-11-14

If you are expecting The Sheltering Sky to be nothing more than a travelogue of Morocco coupled with a forgettable story ... well, you'll be surprised.  Perhaps more so than any other novel I've read Paul Bowles succeeds in expressing the most deep, complex human emotions into words.  And he does so without making The Sheltering Sky a cumbersome read.  The narrative flows rather well.  Yet this book is not for avid readers of Oprah books; The Sheltering Sky is far more ambitious and disturbing than anything published nowadays.  And as for a travelogue, this book will not enhance Morocco's tourist business.<br />The story?  On the surface it is about a floundering American couple who, in the late 1940s, head to Morocco with hopes of having some fun (and salvaging their marriage).  However as we soon learn, through deliciously subtle language, is that not only is their marriage having troubles but our couple have seemingly forgot about their reasons for living.  Worse, this trip becomes a nightmare (..no spoilers).  Towards the end of the book we get an especially close look at the wife's spiritual death/re-birth (..this latter aspect might be offensive to conservative/religious folks).<br />As with the other reviewers I must say The Sheltering Sky is truly a special, memorable read.  It is a challenging but not an especially difficult read.  And I found the author's views of Arabs and foreigners to be relatively balanced.  Or rather, no one race/nationality is portrayed better/worse at the expense of another.<br />Bottom line: one of the few books rightly called a modern classic.	2002-11-04

The story is about, not surprisingly, a piano player.  This poor fellow has a most bizarre background, and an equally bizarre family.  Nothing works for him, his prospects are bleak.  Then in walks (or rather, crawls) his long absent brother who is escaping from some nasty criminals ... and our piano player's world is turned on its head.  No happy ending (, or beginning or middle).  The story oozes despair and loneliness.  Yet this is its strength.<br />David Goodis does an superb job in capturing the emotional turmoil of our piano player.  His prose is very good, and the characterizations in general are well-drawn.  The story itself, while original enough, is not outstanding.  However upon reading the book I felt as if I brought into 1950s Philadelphia, living with our piano player and his low-life \\"friends\\" and family.<br />Bottom line: definitely not a dose of sunshine.  But wonderful nonetheless.	2002-10-28

Both work for the Miami Herald.  Both are funny guys.  Dave thanked for the Hiaasen's support in writing the book, and Hiaasen's accolades of Barry's first novel 'Big Trouble' is splattered on its back cover.  However I think Carl Hiaasen should keep his distance.  With his first novel Barry has, to an extent, beat Hiaasen at his own game.<br />Like Hiaasen's books, Dave has selected whacky Miami as the location for 'Big Trouble'.  And following Hiaasen's formula Barry has also centered his story on befuddled middle-income/rich folks who get embroiled in nasty business and sleazily funny criminals.  The actual story in 'Big Trouble' is too silly to describe; it's just a zany slapstick romp through the Miami suburbs<br />However Dave Barry is not exactly another Carl Hiaasen.  'Big Trouble' is not especially well-written.  Although hardly fine literature, at least Hiaasen's prose can be considered as very competent.  Dave Barry's work seems very thin by comparison. Yet unlike Hiaasen, Barry doesn't blather on about the ecology and rotten tourists, and so his book is a pure comic read without any hidden social agenda.  However Hiaasen is better when it comes to brutally satiric humor (..Barry's humor is just goofy).<br />Bottom line: pure silliness.  Irresistable fluff.	2002-10-28

I've read several Ann Rule true crime novels, and most have been either good or excellent.  However &quot;In the Name of Love: ...&quot; is a comparative disappointment.  All the hallmarks of Ann Rule (fine writing, excellent research, and a remarkable true story) are absent from this book.  And perhaps worse, in the main story Ann Rule writes as if she has transformed herself into some trashy romance novelist ... complete with glowing comments of a handsome husband (I guess the photos in the book weren't very kind) by an adoring wife.  Very saccharine, to a sickening extent.<br />In this book we have one main story (&quot;In the Name of Love&quot;) followed by a few short stories.  The main story is about a middle-aged entrepreneur who gets killed, and his young wife goes through hell afterwards until the killers are brought to justice.  Compared to Ann Rule's wonderful works such as &quot;Dead by Sunset&quot; the story is relatively flat, and Ann doesn't do much justice in &quot;getting into the heads&quot; of the killers.  It is as if this story was written in haste.  Worse, the short stories are little more than collections of Seattle-area police reports from the 1960s/1970s.  Yes, the stories are strange and horrific.  But they all have a &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; feel about them.<br />Is the book all bad?  Well, no.  As with all Ann Rule books &quot;In the Name of Love...&quot; is very readable.  Or rather, it is a fast read.  It certainly makes for a harmless time-filler at the beach or on an airplane.  But really, Ann Rule has done much better.<br />Bottom line: certainly not terrible, but a thoroughly forgettable reading experience.	2002-10-25

People often categorise Goodis novels along the same lines as works by Jim Thompson or Cornell Woolrich.  But Of Tender Sin reminds me of the earlier works by Patricia Highsmith (Strangers on a Train, The Talented Mr Ripley), complete with the deconstruction of a paranoid, weak individual with criminal intent.<br />In this book with have a young actuary and his wife going through ... a difficult patch.  He thinks she is cheating on him.  He also starts have strange visions (..the sudden appearence of platinum blonde hair on women) and disturbing flashbacks (unwholesome memories of his older sister).  Just when his life couldn't get more weird he then sets on getting the man he thinks his wife is seeing, runs into an old flame (a very strange lady), and ... the story gets very interesting indeed.<br />My only complaint with the book, and really a minor one, is the ending.  Goodis writes very nicely, and the story builds up a decent level of suspense.  But the ending seems anti-climatic and all too ... realistic.  For a book that is very bizarre I didn't expect, or want, a believable ending.<br />Bottom line: I can't understand why his books aren't better known.  David Goodis is a talent, and Of Tender Sin is a fine read.	2002-10-21

The Tesseract starts off so much like The Beach (Alex Garland's first novel).  The setting is a slimey hotel in the tropics (Manila), and we have a man caught up in some rather nasty (criminal) business.  However just as the tension really builds the author does a major context switch and the reader is then told the lives of various tangential Filipino characters.  In the end Alex Garland pulls everyone together for a rather shocking (read: violent) finale.  Weird?  Yes.  But surprisingly well done.<br />For me The Tesseract is a better book than The Beach, an incredibly successful first novel by Garland.  Firstly the author really captures the sense of despair of the Filipino people and the seedy, humid, polluted, and impoverished elements of Manila.  Rather than being a singular story of urban violence Alex Garland paints a panorama of unfortunate lives.  While its \\"bouncy\\" structure works very well generally I thought the beginning (mondo violence) and ending (mondo violence) were a bit inconsistent with the rest of the book (human drama, no violence).  But unlike The Beach, The Tesseract certainly isn't cool.  No sex, no drugs, and no beautiful people.  It's just a well-written novel...	2002-10-13

And most were disappointed with the author's previous novel, Choke.  Thankfully he rebounds significantly with Lullaby.<br />In Lullaby we have a world where black magic exists. Most significantly, a &quot;culling poem&quot; contained in a children's book kills the recipient (listener) of the poem.  In comes a very eclectic mix of misfits who both abuse this culling poem and try to limit its distribution.  Granted, the premise of the book is a bit ... weird.  But story moves at a good pace, and the ending is particularly ... weird (in a good way).<br />However compared to Palahniuk's early works (Fight Club, Invisible Monsters) Lullaby is still a bit of a disappointment.  Missing are Palahniuk's scathing wit and his brilliant humour.  However compared to Choke it is much better written, and its plot better defined.<br />Bottom line: Palahniuk has woken up!  Recommended.	2002-10-09

Although written more than thirty years ago Cocksure is still a startlingly fresh look at morality and the media; too bad it's no longer in print (..however at least here in Britain it isn't hard to find a copy at secondhand bookshops).  Without exercising any form of restraint, Richler paints a modern world where prudes are ostracized and sexual liberation has gone wild.  The book is quite rude, and so the easily offended should pass it by (..I think the title of the book is a fair warning of its contents).<br />The story is about a hapless middle-aged media man in London coping with a cheating wife, friends who falsely accuse him as being Jewish (\\"Jewish-ness\\", anti-semitism, and paranoia over anti-semitism are common themes in Richler novels), worries over his under-sized member, and a workplace overrun by very strange people.  Society is morally corrupt (his kid's advant-garde school is really bizarre), and our poor chump always seems to come out on the losing end.  It's a very funny read.  However the story seems to move side-ways; nothing really exciting happens.  Fortunately Richler's sarcastic wit has never been in better form.<br />Bottom line: a very rude and funny read.  Worth a look.	2002-10-07

Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe detective stories, while never dull, can sometimes have almost hysterical, over-the-top plots which become terribly confusing to decipher.  Fortunately the cracking dialogue and bizarre characters compensate nicely.  In The High Window the author takes a breather, and delivers a story which is relatively simple ... and enjoyable to read.<br />Like in many Marlowe stories, our naughty private eye is hired by a rich recluse.  This time the recluse is a rich widow who believes her trashy daughter-in-law has stolen a rare coin inherited from her deceased hubby.  As Marlowe investigates we understand that the daughter-in-law keeps some rather nasty company, and before long Marlowe is tangled in multiple homicide situation.  Of course in the end it is all resolved in a surprisingly uncontrived way (..at least by Raymond Chandler standards).<br />My only real complaint, or rather disappointment, is the general absence of Marlowe's normally razor-sharp sarcasm.  In other books Marlowe can be extremely brutish with the ladies, and the ladies all fall in love with him.  In The High Window we do not see this side of Marlowe, and so he seems somewhat two-dimensional in this story.<br />Bottom line: most definitely not a Chandler classic, but certainly a very enjoyable read.  Recommended.	2002-10-04

Eye of the Beholder justly deserves its accolades of being \\"the detective story to end all detective stories\\".  Its strange, sad story is very intriguing if somewhat contrived.  Unfortunately Marc Behm's prose, and to a lesser extent his characterizations, is a bit thin.  Also the dialogue is, at times, almost laugh-at-loud silly.  Fortunately it's the story itself which keeps the reader's eyes glued the page.<br />As for the story, we have a private detective who becomes utterly obsessed with a homicidial young woman.  He follows her from one murder to the next (..this sort book contains literally hundreds of killings), and by stealth helps cover up her crimes.  They both eventually find themselves travelling across the USA multiple times over some 30 years.  But his love is unspoken, and their relationship is certainly spooky.  And Marc Behm concludes the book, and the relationship, in a most satisfactory way.<br />Bottom line: a very strange story of obsession, murder, and lonely people.  Recommended.	2002-10-01

Despite all the glowing comments in previous amazon.com reviews I must confess that I really don't see how The Silent Cry can be judged as anything other than a strange (read: unbelievable, contrived), totally depressing piece of (otherwise well-written) literature.  It compares poorly to some of Yukio Mishima's and Haruki Murakami's better works.  Having lived in Japan for years I shudder to think what sort of image it projects about post-war Japanese youth.<br />The story is a bit complex.  Generally it portrays the lives of dysfunctional brothers returning to their ancient country estate, and somehow making parallels between their lives and those of their great-grandfather and his brother during the time of the Meiji restoration (1860s).  Some of the insights are interesting, but sadly these are buried in what can be described as a mess.  The modern day (actually, circa 1960) brothers and the friends and family have an impossibly depressing, unfortunate lives.  The wife is an alcoholic, children/siblings/friends commit suicide and/or suffer from horrible physical/mental anomalies.  In this 300 page book no one, and I mean *no one*, so much as smiles.  So you think the Japanese people are a nature-loving, inherently serene people?  If so I suggest you do NOT read this book!<br />Having said all this, the story does pick up some pace towards the end (..after an extremely tedious first half).  And generally speaking the author, and the translator, have produced nice prose.  A shame it is all wasted on a strange story with neurotic (and uninteresting) characters.<br />Bottom line: time would be better spent on reading some better examples of modern Japanese literature.  Best give The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (Murakami) a try and forget The Silent Cry.	2002-09-30

The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester is often hailed as one of the best science fiction novels of all time.  Indeed most of the amazon.com reviews are extremely enthusiastic.  However upon finishing this book I really have to wonder what the fuss is all about?  Not only does this book compare badly to Alfred Bester's other major work (The Demolished Man), but it seems to be non-spectacular from several fronts: prose, characterizations, and believability.  Compared to The Demolished Man, a very fine piece of *literature* (not \\"merely\\" science fiction), The Stars My Destination seems to be written by a different person entirely.<br />As for the story, fast forward a few centuries where space travel is common and most of the planets and moons in our solar system are colonised.  People have also developed the ability for tele-transporting themselves vast distances (so much for planes, trains and automobiles).  We focus our attention on one (justifiably) very angry young man (..long story) and his burning desire for revenge.  However in the very end, after some soul-searching and very contrived circumstances, he undergoes a sense of redemption ... and that's about it.  Moving?  No, it doesn't compare to Crime & Punishment nor even The Shawshank Redemption.  Well-written?  No, the story line bounces about in a flimsy fashion.  Worth reading?  I think science fiction fans might still want to give this book a look if only for curiousity value.  There are also some vignettes buried within which does keep one wanting to read through until the end.  But for all others I recommend reading other early science fiction classics such as The Demolished Man and The Space Merchants (Kornbluth/Pohl).<br />Bottom line: unjustly judged as a classic.  Passable entertainment only.	2002-09-25

The Demolished Man is my first Alfred Bester novel.  And I was very impressed with it.  It has the delicious characteristics of being a mystery novel in a futuristic (24th century) science fiction setting.  A great story that is also very competently written.<br />As for the story, we are in New York City a few hundred years in the future.  Mankind has evolved to the extent where there is a substantial number of people with mind-reading (ESP) capabilities.  These people are somewhat segregated from the main populace, unionized, and serve specific roles in society.  Because of the difficulty of keeping secrets with such people around it seems that society benefits greatly from their presence.<br />Yet there is a power-hungry man who has rather forceful and nasty ambitions.  He is not adverse to using anyone, including the ESP-enriched individuals, to his own self-interests.  Then he gets involved with a murder, and a super mind-reading cop enters the fray.  Mix this with some rather intriguing dream sequences and you have a wonderful reading experience.  <br />Bottom line: a terrific early science fiction masterpiece.  Strongly recommmended.	2002-09-19

Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe detective stories certain vary in quality.  While always capturing the ambiance on 1940s sleazy Los Angeles, the author often constructs mysteries with too many characters and implausible scenarios.  I'm often too baffled half-way through to really care how the book ends, although reading Chandler's prose and punchy dialogue is certainly enjoyable as it is.  Fortunately The Little Sister is one of Chandler's better efforts.<br />In The Little Sister we have a discreet set of characters loosely connected to a young woman who hires Marlowe to find her brother.  Of course no one is as they seem, and all the beautiful ladies fall in love with Marlowe.  Thankfully there are only about a dozen characters in total to keep track of, and Chandler gives his Marlowe character some of the best (and rudest) one-liners I've ever read.  Believable?  Not for a moment.  But delicious escapism.<br />Bottom line: not one of his better know works, but The Little Sister is one of my favorite Raymond Chandler novels. (My favorite is The Lady in the Lake.)	2002-09-15

These attributes also apply to science fiction.  True, a book like Neuromancer tries to \\"push the envelope\\" by diving into a story where reality as we know it is spun on its head.  But I expect the author to help ease the reader into understanding his alternate reality.  Mr Gibson seemingly chose not to do this, ...  Reading Neuromancer is akin to completing a jigsaw puzzle without a completed picture to guide you, and in the end one discovers several pieces are missing.  I assume Mr Gibson understands the complete picture.  ...  But I suspect many of them simply think that reading a 300 page novel full of AI/cyberspace/holographic gibberish is, by definition, \\"way cool\\".  However I don't feel this way.<br />Bottom line: I think I wasted several hours of my life reading Neuromancer.  Not recommended.	2002-09-11

Ann Rule, the American true crime diva, has published plenty of books over the past 20+ years.  Unfortunately the quality of this material has varied, largely depending on the personal (emotional) interest she has on the subject matter.  Fortunately in Dead by Sunset, a story about a handsome and charming monster named Brad Cunningham, the author is clearly caught up in all aspects of a horrific crime (a wife/mother/attorney is bashed to a pulp).  She in fact dedicates the book to the victim and all abused women.<br />Dead by Sunset's strengths are not in the unravelling of the crime (..we know early on who does it) or in the analysis of the criminal trials (..actually this is the weak part of the book).  It is Ann Rule's in-depth analysis of the women who completely fall for an intelligent, sex-on-legs Romeo who really seems to hate women.  Brad Cunningham is truly a vile person.  But upon reading the book one has to wonder how is that several wives and mistresses could be fooled into loving him?  Ann Rule never attempts at answering this question.  Yet we certainly see the repurcussions of loving Mr Wrong.<br />Bottom line: while the momentum sputters slightly towards the end, one has to be impressed with Ann Rule's attention to detail and writing talents.  Strongly recommended.	2002-09-07

A couple of biochemists in the UK circa 1960 discover a lichen with extraordinary properties: it is able to extend human life by at least a factor of three.  I was then anticipating a story which delves into the aftermath of having our lives elongated to two hundred years, along with all the social consequences (some good, mostly bad).  But Wyndham disappoints.  Once this lichen is discovered he spends too much time on the inter-personal squabbling between the scientists and discussions of the merits of publicly disclosing such a find ... I was always thinking \\"come on! get on with it!\\".  Finally something does indeed happen but it is only towards the very end of the book.<br />Trouble With Lichen would have been a wonderful book in the hands of a more competent writer.  John Wyndham has indeed written better; it is a mystery as to why he didn't capitalize on the fine premise he laid out in this book.<br />Bottom line: certainly okay for John Wyndham fans.  But I find it difficult to recommend it to anyone else.	2002-09-01

John Wyndham's Chocky is a rather humanistic story about how a family deals with one son's mysterious unseen friend, Chocky.  At first they thought their son was suffering from an over-exercised imagination.  Then it becomes plainly that Chocky is real, and is literally from out of this world.  Trite?  In a way, yes.  But I found the characterizations, especially of the parents, to be very well judged.  So from a science fiction perspective Chocky doesn't enthrall, but otherwise it stands fairly well on its own.<br />However I expected much more.  John Wyndham has written some very intriguing books which really makes one think of social/environmental issues.  The Chrysalids, for me, is his best.  Wyndham simply didn't try to achieve such heights with Chocky, which is unfortunate.<br />Bottom line: a curious and very readable novel.  But Wyndham has done much better.	2002-08-28

I first learned of The Color Purple by seeing the film version back in the 1980s.  I confess I had tears at the end.  So some fifteen years later I thought I'd re-live the tears and give the original novel, by Alice Walker, a try.  Was I disappointed?  Well, yes and no.<br />Firstly, the novel is structured purely as diary entries and letters written over some thirty years.  It chronicles the life of a poor, beaten, and completely used and abused young black American woman in the first half of the twentieth century living in the South.  It seems every white person and every black man Celie encounters is either rascist, mean, or simply stupid.  Unsurprisingly, such encounters leaves her feeling worthless and unwanted.  But then something happens, and through the love of another woman (her husband's lover!) she learns to love herself and life all around her.<br />From a high-level this is certainly a beautiful story, and Ms Walker's writing skills are superb.  Yet I found this 200 page chronology of a woman's life to be a bit simplistic.  Very little is mentioned of poverty or church activities, both of which would be central to any black Southern woman's life back then.  And worldly events, such as WW II, only get brief and inconsequent coverage.  I also find Celie's discovery of lesbianism to be a bit ... contrived, but not impossible I suppose.<br />Bottom line: a worthy literary effort that doesn't quite measure up to the film adaptation.	2002-08-27

The Big Sleep, one of those many tough guy sleuth detective stories which reminds one of Perry Mason, The Thin Man, and Colombo (..if he was placed in 1930s Los Angeles), is one of Raymond Chandler's better stories.  Some of his Philipe Marlowe detective stories have very convoluted plots which make the stories almost incoherent.  Fortunately this isn't the case with The Big Sleep.<br />Here our story is of a elderly, disabled rich man with wild and dangerous daughters.  Philip Marlowe is hired to sort out a blackmail situation, but then finds himself pulled into the twisted lives of the two daughters, their boyfriends, and the criminal underworld.  The story does hang together, and is generally plausible.  Next to The Lady in the Lake, The Big Sleep is my favorite Philipe Marlowe novel.<br />Bottom line: an above par Philipe Marlowe story.  Recommended.	2002-08-22

We have a quaint English village with all its women of child-bearing age suddenly (..spontaneously!) becoming pregnant, including virgins.  Divine intervention?  Well, let us say there was some intervention from something beyond this world. Curiously, the folks of Midwich carry on with the births of these children.  However these children soon exhibit rather sinister traits, and Midwich soon finds itself overwhelmed.<br />While certainly a fascinating read, The Midwich Cuckoos has a somewhat dated feel.  Certainly alien invasions and the raising of alien beings wouldn't go down well with most folks nowadays.  And unlike other Wyndham novels I fail to see any underlying social message here (..other than don't raise kids that aren't humans?).  Still, Wyndham is a clever writer.  And The Midwich Cuckoos is one of his better efforts.<br />Bottom lines: strange, disturbing, and not terribly believable.  But certainly an interesting read.	2002-08-19

Much of his stories were published in Ellery Queen's Mystery magazine - the equivalent of literary junk food.  Often his material is entertaining yet poor written and forgettable.  The same goes for his novels (..although I loved his Waltz into Darkness).<br />In this collection of short stories, including Rear Window (made famous by the Hitchcock film), we have several stories about suspense and murder.  I found most to be very average.  Rear Window was actually quite disappointing; the film adaptation was much better.  And one of the stories was actually the template of a Woolrich novel I read, Night Has A Thousand Eyes (..the novel is much better than the short story).  But there are some jewels. These involve a mix of themes such as: a killer of dance hall hostesses, a murder of a milk bottle thief, and the final story involving a sadistic husband.<br />Bottom line: an eclectic mish-mash of murder and suspense.  Hit and miss, sure.  But recommended nonetheless.	2002-08-16

Farewell, My Lovely is one of several Philip Marlowe detective stories from Raymond Chandler known for their smokey, 1940s L.A. feel.  Philip Marlowe is the private eye whom ladies love, but he seems to be more interested in solving extremely bizarre crimes (and not getting paid for his time) than in romance.  Sometimes Raymond Chandler does a brilliant job in building a story around the Marlowe character, as he did with The Lady In The Lake.  However he misses the mark with Farewell, My Lovely.<br />Why?  Hmmm, let's see.  Well certainly the story scores well on the bizarre-ness scale.  Marlowe finds himself in a pickle complete with killers, boozers, psychopathes ... the usual lot.  But Raymond Chandler does a poor job with building on these characters; there are simply too many of them with only cameo appearances.  The author fails to give his Marlowe character much to do other than waltz into one improbable scenario to another.  Naturally in the end the story comes together, sort of.  But Farewell, My Lovely sadly falls into the &quot;curious but forgettable&quot; category of mystery novels.<br />Bottom line: Raymond Chandler on a bad day.  Passable entertainment.	2002-08-12

John Wyndham has written some justly deserved science fiction classics, such as The Day of the Triffids and The Chrysalids.  What makes these stories so interesting are their thinly disguised attacks on real social/environmental issues.  However Kraken Wakes is different, and unfortunately it's not different in a good way.<br />In Kraken Wakes the world is bombarded by mysterious objects falling from the heavens into the deep ocean.  After considerable confusion the world realises that indeed they are have been invaded by aliens who are particularly nasty, with little effective means of doing anything about it.  All this is chronicled very nicely by a married couple working for a fictitious British radio network.  <br />Sounds interesting?  It is, sort of.  There are suspenseful moments, and it certainly is a creative story.  However John Wyndham does a rather poor with the characterizations, and if there are any social commentaries buried in this story it is certainly buried beyond my recognition.  So Kraken Wakes is simply a passably written science fiction story, nothing more.<br />Bottom line: certainly not a bad read, but John Wyndham has written better.  For John Wyndham fans only.	2002-08-12

And of course as people migrate and blend with other people both cultures and languages blend as well.  Great subject matter; too bad Mr Cavalli-Sforza has an uncanny way of making it rather dull reading.<br />Genes, Peoples and Languages is certainly an earnest attempt to document mankind migrations in a form that mere mortals can understand.  And much of it is readily digestable.  Unfortunately the authors frequently dabbles into rather advanced areas of genetics and statistics which really weighs down the book.  Thankfully there are many charts which simplify the noise.  I found myself fast-reading over much of the verbage and only focusing on niche areas of particular interest; I finished the book in only two days.<br />I also found the book to give uneven coverage of various subjects, probably corresponding to the author's areas of expertise.  He is obviously brilliant in terms of genetics and human migration.  But I found his discussions on human language evolution and how migration affects culture to be weak.<br />Bottom line: certainly has the makings of a great television documentary.  But as reading material for the masses this book a choppy ride.  Not recommended.	2002-08-05

It is a wonderfully concise, powerful story on how conformity above all else is vile.  Perhaps not the author's intended target, but when I read The Chrysalids I thought of religious fanatics of all forms who are self-righteous and full of hate (..although these folks don't view it that way).<br />In The Chrysalids we have planet Earth some two thousand years after some worldwide disaster (nuclear destruction, presumably).  Only limited colonies of humans survive.  Many more straggling, deformed humanoids abound ... along with freakish plants and animals.  In one of the colonies they strive, above all else, to maintain purity of life forms (animal, planet, human).  Humans with even the slightest deformity are thrown out of the colony, or are destroyed.  Colony leaders cite biblical references to justify such actions.<br />This rather frightening picture of the future is told through the eyes of a boy who discovers he, along with several other children, share a \\"defect\\" - they all have mental telepathic capabilities.  These children fear for their lives, and rightly so.<br />The story so far is rich and fast-paced; simply wonderful!  Unfortunately the last bit of the book gets a bit wobbly, or at least falters from its high plateau - it turns into series of chase/battle sequences.  However the very ending is rewarding.<br />Bottom line: compulsory reading for all.	2002-08-05

Firstly, it has won accolades as a great first novel (by Joe Connelly).  Even a film has been made based on the story.  And judging by the other amazon.com reviewers, the style of the book is supposedly Chuck 'Fight Club' Palahniuk-esque; I am a fan of Chuck Palahniuk.  Was I disappointed?  Er.., yes.<br />Bringing Out The Dead is, as one understands by reading the dust jacket, the story of a burned out ambulance driver in a seedy section of Manhatten.  It is indeed written in the first person, and has the punchy/neurotic feel of Fight Club and Survivor (both by Palahniuk).  However unlike these (very good) novels Bringing Out the Dead has no clever message or plot twists, let alone any humour.  The reader is plunged on to a rollercoaster of absolutely horrific ambulance rides with paramedics who should be institutionalized.  However judging by the frightening patients they treat in endless succession one can understand why they've turned into monsters.  I pray such a story doesn't remotely portray reality.  While individual vignettes within the novel are indeed interesting, the overall feel of the book is one endless succession of horror.  In the end I didn't understand the point of it all.<br />Having said this, Bringing Out The Dead isn't a bad novel - indeed, it is an impressive first novel.  The characterizations are very interesting, and there are elements of brilliance in between the repetitive scenes of horror.  Perhaps Joe Connelly can produce a fine novel if he had better focus, and tried to deliver some meaning to words.<br />Bottom line: a ghoulish reading experience which both fascinates and horrifies, yet it ultimately bored this reader.  A near miss.	2002-08-01

The Day of the Triffids has all the feel on a 1950s cheesy science fiction movie: implausible monsters (walking/thinking/hunting plants) threatening the existence of the human race.  There is also some Cold War paranoia (..the commies are behind all this!) for good measure.  However the book surprisingly rises above the silliness and is, thankfully, an enjoyable read.<br />The Day of the Triffids succeeds because of two factors.  One, it does a terrific job of building suspense; it is indeed a page-turner.  Secondly, its description of how people act after &quot;the world has ended&quot; is frighteningly realistic.  Think Stephen King's The Stand and you've got the right idea.  However Wyndham's prose is a bit more crisp, and the scenes are less graphic.<br />Bottom line: a surprisingly mature bit of nostalgic science fiction.  Not quite as shocking as when it was first published, yet The Day of the Triffids still offers reading entertainment value.	2002-07-30

The King's Gambit, the first of SPQR series by John Maddox Roberts, is a quirky mess than generally works.  Compared to the Colleen McCullough's Roman historical fiction series The King's Gambit is almost shambolic on the historical bits.  Compared to Steven Saylor's Gordianus Roman historical detective series, the characterizations are weak.  And worse, John Maddox Roberts simply fails to produce prose to the standards of anything resembling better-than-average literature.  Yet I liked The King's Gambit.  Why?<br />Like the Gordianus novels, The King's Gambit introduces us to a sleuth unravelling a rather complex series of murders and mishaps.  Naturally the corrupt and very wealthy politicians of the day are behind all this.  While much of the story seems to lack inventiveness, John Maddox Roberts does manage to twist matters around in a most interesting fashion (..no spoilers here).  And thankfully, the ending is rather good.<br />Bottom line: a good story somewhat poorly told.  However the end justifies the means, and so even fans of more finer ancient Roman historical novels will enjoy The King's Gambit.	2002-07-29

Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy starts out so well in the first book (The Golden Compass) but goes off in confusing tangents in the second (The Subtle Knife).  And I think that if an adult reader such as myself found it confusing I fear that its target audience (young teens) will be completely turned off (..or maybe they'll actually understand it all?!?).<br />In The Subtle Knife, which closely follows the first book (which is a prerequisite), we are now entertained by frequent bouncing between different worlds.  Not space travel, but sliding through different representations of the world as we know it.  As in The Golden Compass we have our heroine Lyra, her world of daemons and witches, and a new hero (a young boy) who wields \\"the subtle knife\\" (quite literally a knife, but some knife! :-)).  Yes, there are very good scenes and lots of action.  But I found the story gets too convoluted after a while; Mr Pullman seems to be too self-obsessed in talking about his many worlds while leaving this reader's interest in the wake.<br />Bottom line: probably mandatory reading for fans of The Golden Compass.  But I fear most will be vaguely disappointed.	2002-07-22

This is especially true of the characterizations, but thankfully not the wacky story lines.  And Hiaasen has a hiliarious way with words, which can sometimes be rather vulgar (yes, some folks might be offended).<br />In Stormy Weather we have greedy out-of-towners and locals trying to make a fast buck after a hurricane wipes out half of Miami.  Of course these folks are violent, crude, and more often than not do not get their way due to hilarious mishaps.  Hiaasen is well-known for his hatred of crooked politicians, racists, polluters, and big business.  And in Stormy Weather all these elements suffer rather badly, to no surprise.<br />Bottom line: while it doesn't hold a candle to his classics (Skin Tight, Strip Tease), Stormy Weather stands firmly among Hiaasen's better works.  Recommended.	2002-07-13

So often I read novels with some modest historical references where the author expresses thanks to the \\"little people\\" who helped with the research.  Sometimes these include dozens of names.  Astoundingly in \\"The First Man in Rome\\" Colleen McCullough says that is was basically a one woman show.  Honestly, this book is such a comprehensive study of an era of Roman history that I think it would be worthy of someone working on a doctorate dissertation.  The detail is breathtaking.  And Ms McCullough even does the (very good) maps and other illustrations!    It is hard to explain the story of a 1000+ page historical novel.  But it basically chronicles the political and military struggles in and around Rome circa 105 BC.  The detail to which the author describes these events can be a bit beyond the interest of most readers but at least her prose is very rich and enjoyable to read.  And she entertains the reader with several vignettes into the personal lives of the Roman leaders.  Rather than dwelling on debauchery and crude aspects of their lifestyle she focuses on aspects on what is important to the Roman citizen: honor, status, money, and power.    Bottom line: a long and sometimes heavy read which is quite simply a masterpiece.  Compulsory reading.	2002-07-08

Most everyone will find something to hate in Eric Schlosser's book, and perhaps a fair number will find a lot to hate about the author himself (he is very left wing, and he is long at pointing fingers and short on providing viable alternatives).  'Fast Food Nation' was a bit of a surprise.  I expected a lot McDonalds bashing, plus depressing reading on how unhealthy junk food really is.  And yes, Eric Schlosser does deliver these messages very clearly.  But fortunately he has a lot more to say.<br />'Fast Food Nation' is a seemingly endless hate-a-rama by Eric Schlosser.  Fortunately, what he hates is really bad stuff: abused animals, abused meatpackers, abused employees of money hungry corportate giants, abused consumers, etc.  Some of his observations, seemingly well-researched, are most shocking and horrific.  He doesn't blast so much the fast food companies as much as he blasts the terrible social costs incurred by them.  And he is mercilous to the (seemingly all Republican) politicians who collude with these companies (and their suppliers).  The best I can say about 'Fast Food Nation' is that I learned a lot.  Yes, probably much of it is biased and unfair journalism.  But sadly most of it is undoubtedly true.<br />Bottom line: mandatory and uncomfortable reading.	2002-06-23

Requiem, like so many people, at any airport before boarding a flight.  Although the amazon.com reviews were favorable I feared somewhat that this would be one of the many vaguely competent yet forgettable popular crime novels.  So how did the book measure up?  Thankfully, rather well.<br />The story is about serial killings in LA-LA land, with a pair of private investigators out to solve these murders.  Things get very sticky when one of these investigators, a former cop, is implicated.  Crais does a fine job in delivering a fast pace, complete with rather unpredictable story.  It is certainly a page-turner.<br />However the story has a somewhat familiar feel, resembling more a movie script than literature.  The characterizations are a bit two-dimensional, the prose is marginally adequate.  While L.A. Requiem is certainly not a classic it certainly rises above the \\"forgettable\\" status.<br />Bottom line: an enjoyable crime novel.  Recommended.	2002-06-15

Haruki Murakami is certainly a man with unique capabilities.  His \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\" is perhaps the best new age, surrealistic novel of all time (certainly the best I've read).  In his earlier \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland...\\" we get a preview of such talents.<br />In \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland...\\" we have basically two concurrent stories, one being a fantasy (complete with unicorns) and the other, well, a rather surreal story situated in Tokyo involving mind manipulation.  Each story has its own strength but they seem to wander aimlessly until Murakami ties both of them together in a \\"way cool!!!\\" sort of way.  Yes, it is a bit contrived and over-cooked.  Yet it is the sort of book Murakami fans will love.<br />Bottom line: a somewhat minor episode in Murakami's literary career.  Yet its creativity and originality earn well-deserved kudos.	2002-06-11

Ann Rule is a most prolific writer of true crime stories.  She churns out so much that I think at times she just goes through the motions (..like with 'Bitter Harvest').  Yet at other times she really gets very personal and emotional about the subject matter, and she either shines (..like with 'Stranger Beside Me' and 'If You Really Loved Me') or gets too prejudiced in her views and offers biased journalism (..like with 'Small Sacrifices').  Where does 'And Never Let Her Go' fit in?  Well,...<br />In 'And Never Let Her Go' we have the true story about a wealthy attorney, Thomas Capano, who seems to be of an adulterous, egotistical, and often cruel guy - the kind of man every woman seems to fall for (as strange as it seems).  When one of his conquests trys to break free from him he exacts his revenge in a most ghastly way.  Familiar kind of story?  Yes.  Well told?  Yes.  Surprises?  A few.  Worth reading?  Yes, but I recommend Ann Rule's other books (mentioned above) where the crime(s) and investigations are more intriguing.<br />Bottom line:  not an Ann Rule classic, but hardly a dud.

During the 1860s Wilkie Collins, with his terrific The Woman In White, started the period of 'sensation' novels.  These novels are rather over-the-type, almost slapstick-like mystery stories.  Mary Elizabeth Braddon followed with her own flavor of sensation novels. While I love many of Wilkie Collins novels I was disappointed with Braddon's most famous work, Lady Audley's Secret.  But when I ran into a copy of John Marchmont's Legacy I thought I'd give Ms Braddon a try.  Was I disappointed?  Well...<br />Firstly, the story is a typical Victorian era melodrama: family members squabbling over an inheritance, with certain members stopping at nothing to become rich.  Ms Braddon does do a good job on the characterizations, and the ultimate mystery does build up to a good conclusion.  The book is nicely structured (..unlike Lady Audley's Secret, where we find the story basically ending 100 pages from the finish).<br />However Ms Braddon is simply not a very good writer.  Her prose is weak, especially compared to Wilkie Collins.  Every third sentence ends with an exclamation point, which must be Ms Braddon's way of indicating high drama (?).  <br />Bottom line: a unremarkable slice of Victorian literary history.  Certainly not terrible, but nonetheless a far cry from Wilkie Collins material.	2002-05-30

The Space Merchants is an interesting little science fiction novel which describes the world in the 23rd century.  By then global capitalism, especially the top advertisers, almost literally rule the plant.  Excessive population and pollution have driven the masses underground.  People are nourished by the flesh of weird genetically modified beasts.  Considering this book was written fifty years ago I found the subject matter surprisingly fresh and relevant.<br />The story involves a top ad man who finds his task of developing a campaign for the colonisation of Venus dramatically undermined by dark forces.  In this complex stew of industrial espionage are competing ad companies and the underground conservationist guerillas.  The mystery moves along at a good clip although it sputters a bit towards the end.<br />Overall this book touches some deep issues along the lines of Aldous ('Brave New World') Huxley, and has a satiric (and weird) feel like the works of Philip K. ('Ubik') Dick.  Certainly a minor classic in its own right.	2002-05-27

The Golden Compass (..known as Northern Lights here in the UK) is a curious, and successful story combining elements of fantasy, morality, and adventure told in a relatively easy-to-read style.  While targetted to early teens it is a complex, deep story which should have appeal to most adults.<br />Like the Harry Potter series, this is a fantasy story with a European setting.  In The Golden Compass people have daemons (little animal creatures) attached to them (physically, emotionally, and spiritually).  It is this bonding between daemons and humans, together with a mysterious portal to another world (universe) way up north in Svalbard (..north of Norway), that drives this story.  At the center is a young teenage girl who bravely yet unwillingly saves the day.  Philip Pullman spins a neat story (mostly) devoid of contrived elements.  My only real complaint is that it too obviously leaves an unfinished ending, as an encouragement to read the next book in the series.  And yes, I will undoubtedly finish the series.<br />Bottom line: a nicely crafted fantasy story.  A cynic might call it a thinking person's Harry Potter.	2002-05-23

Critics of 'We Were Soldiers....' have lauded it as the definitive statement on how life really was on the battlefields of Vietnam.  And certainly the detailed research collected and presented in this book is extremely impressive; full kudos to Messrs. Moore and Galloway.  But does 'We Were Soldiers...' make for good reading entertainment?  For this reviewer, no.<br />Firstly, the book is simply a (non-fiction) account of a 1965 battle at the Ia Drang area in Vietnam.  Harold Moore was one of the leading commanders at that battle, Joseph Galloway was a reporter watching all the fighting.  Clearly it was a horrific, gastly battle (..actually, several battles over a few days).  Hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of Vietnamese soldiers perished, many more suffering from terrible physical/emotional injuries.  Moore/Galloway do fine justice in capturing the horror.<br />Unfortunately the authors spend a tremendous amount of time giving mention, sometimes briefly, on all the hundreds of American participants during the battle.  With so many characters and the minute details of their actions I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed.  No doubt Moore/Galloway wanted to make sure every participant in this nightmare got their full credit, which is certainly commendable.  But as for a reading experience ... I found it pure drudgery after only a hundred pages.  Less would have been more.<br />In addition the book make me feel uncomfortable about Harold Moore and others fighting at Ia Drang, in an unexpected way.  While Harold Moore goes into some length criticising the Johnson administration about its Vietnam policies, he then talks about his visit to Vietnam (many years after Ia Drang) to speak with Vietnamese generals who fought on \\"the other side\\".  I felt his comments did not do justice to these guys who lost a great many more soldiers than the Americans.  And a couple of the quotes which call Vietnamese as \\"gooks\\" brought back a most unpleasent sense of deja vu.<br />Bottom line: stellar research wrapped into a difficult, and disturbing read.  Mandatory for military history bluffs, a definite miss for all others.	2002-05-20

And somehow Saylor's irrepressable private eye, Gordianus, winds up being a bit like Forrest Gump - he always finds himself in the middle of this historic events.  All the stories are rather trifling and forgettable, but somehow very readable and enjoyable.  Saylor has a very light and breezy style to his prose.  And unlike his other Gordianus novels, this collection of short stories does not get bogged down with explanations of Roman history ... and so even folks who might have found Saylor's other works to be a bit dry will like The House Of The Vestals.<br />Bottom line: perfectly enjoyable Roman fluff.

Haruki Murakami has written some fine material, especially his brilliant The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. How does David Mitchell's Number9Dream hold up in comparison? Not very well.<br />The story itself, a complex tale of an illegitimate country boy going to Tokyo in search of his father, is interesting enough. Mitchell is most confident in his prose when delving into a side story concerning the yakuza, the Japanese crime syndicate his father obviously rubs shoulders with. But unfortunately our lead character is, quite literally, an avid dreamer. These weird dreams, constantly sprinkled throughout the novel, detract rather than enhance the story. Haruki Murakami is the expert in weaving surreal elements into his novels. David Mitchell fails, quite badly.<br />However all is not lost. There are vignettes within this overly complex novel which are actually quite interesting, and often the characterizations and the prose work very well. David Mitchell also captures the feeling of frenetic Tokyo quite convincingly. With better editting Number9Dream could have been quite a decent read.<br />Bottom line: Murakami fans will be appalled at this derivative material by Mitchell. Certainly not a terrible novel, but one has to wonder why Number9Dream was nominated for the Booker Prize?	2002-05-07
1557721:US	50667536	R3R3CDN0KW98QC	0385501560	729613164	Choke	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Chuck Palahniuk "chokes"....	Firstly, I am a fan of Chuck Palahniuk.  I've found all his books to be original, refreshing .. if somewhat disturbing.  So I had great expectations when I started on his latest book, 'Choke'.  Was I disappointed?<br />Well, let's see.  I expected an original, thought-provoking story.  Unfortunately the story, while original (..about a sexaholic, his strange mother, and his trashed out friends), is not particularly thought-provoking.  The characters didn't have the depth or weirdness of those in his other novels.  There is an unexpected, and rather good, surprise towards the end of 'Choke' but it wasn't enough to derive any entusiasm.<br />I also expected Palahniuk's brilliant prose, complete with often funny one-liners.  Here is an example from 'Choke':<br />\\"The magic of sez is it's acquisition without the burden of possessions.  No matter how many women you take home, there's never a storage problem.\\"<br />Great stuff.  Sadly, there were only a handful of such gems in this book (whereas nearly every other page in Palahniuk's other books contained such jewels).<br />Bottom line: a relatively weak, derivative effort by Palahniuk.  Fans will be disappointed.  Palahniuk newbies should look to any of his other works to appreciate his brilliance.	2002-05-02

While it reads like the memoirs of a cranky, elderly Jewish Canadian who seems to hate most everything (except his last wife and their three kids), it also serves as an interesting analysis of life in Montreal over the last fifty years for the English-speaking minority, especially the enclave of its (once harassed) Jewish residents.<br />While the characterizations of Barney and his friends/family are top notch it is Richler's flair for biting satire and sarcastic wit which leaves the most lasting impression of Barney's Version.  Joseph (Catch-22) Heller wrote novels with similar style and humour.  Yet Richler's Barney has a more worldly, français feel about him compared to Heller's Brooklyn-based characters.<br />Bottom line: Richler presents a character that is larger than life; it's hard to believe Barney doesn't really exist.  Strongly recommended.	2002-04-27

Dick (PKD) certainly wrote a lot of very original science fiction novels and short stories.  Unfortunately much of works is decidedly uneven.  'The Pentultimate Truth' is not one of PKD's better works, but it does have its moments.<br />The story has a great premise.  WW III has come, and the populace is driven underground to work as slave labour for the war effort.  But after fifteen years the folks underground are being pushed to the limit and the truth comes out about what is happening on the surface ... and it isn't what they thought (of course).  PKD does a fine job with the overall plotting and his observations of human greed for power and how the media can distort reality are brilliant.  But sadly, PKD clutters up the story with too much techno verbage and confusing banter between the characters.  <br />Bottom line:  intriguing, diverting, but often times confusing.  For PKD fans only.	2002-04-20

In his latest Roma Sub Rosa mystery series entry starring Gordianus the Finder the author has departed from his proven formula of &quot;heavy on mystery, heavy on history&quot; and has given us a story that is light on mystery, heavy on history ... and a setting outside the Roman Empire.  And unlike the other books in the series, there is relatively little Gordianus familial involvement.  But is Last Seen in Massilia still a worthy addition to the Roma Sub Rosa series?  Absolutely.<br />In Last Seen in Massilia we have Gordianus seeking out his adopted son Meto in what is now present day Marseille (Massilia).  Massilia was a Greek, walled-in city/state long before there was a Roman Empire.  Over the years its government and customs evolved in most unusual ways (..no spoilers here!).  Gordianus arrives in Massilia just when Caesar's troops are literally banging at its doors.  Saylor does an admirable job describing this fascinating era in what must of been a very strange city.  This greatly outweights for what is, unfortunately, a rather contrived plot involving our lovable sleuth Gordianus.<br />Bottom line: a Gordianus novel filled with great Massilian atmosphere and a somewhat silly (yet still enjoyable) mystery angle.  Roma Sub Rosa fans will love it.	2002-04-17

Bitter Harvest is the true story of a very disturbed woman accused of setting her home alight while her children sleep inside, and of attempting to poison her husband.  True to form, Ann Rule expertly \\"peels the onion\\" of this story starting with a thorough examination of this woman's background, her family life, the events leading up to the tragedy, the tragedy itself, the trial, and finally the outcome of the trial.  But surprisingly this winning formula which worked so well in her other books failed to ignite this reader.  Why?...<br />Ann Rule's books succeed when the main villian is either a dangerous, violent psychopath (as in her wonderful Stranger Beside Me), or a manipulative, evil yet clever monster who almost gets away with murder (as in her superb If You Really Loved Me).  But in Bitter Harvest the villian is just a very depressed, somewhat deranged substance abuser who ultimately commits an irrational crime which she (and her family) will always regret.  Interesting yet not exactly enthralling stuff.<br />Bottom line: expertly written, balanced journalism by Ann Rule.  Too bad she didn't select a better true crime story to write about.	2002-04-13
1585599:US	50667536	R1KRB9DE9MFP19	0871133261	119495753	Found in the Street (Highsmith, Patricia)	Books	3	1	7	N	N	an unfortunate divergence from Highsmith's proven formula...	'Found in the Street' is certainly one of Highsmith's stranger books.  Firstly, nearly all the characters are gay, bi-sexual, or at least very gay accepting.  Even in today's era of enlightenment I found all this to be a bit unrealistic.  Secondly, Highsmith lets down the reader by not capitalising on the suspense built up throughout much of the book.  In other words the book's ending is a dud.  Having said all this, 'Found in the Street' is standard Highsmith in that it is well-written (nice prose) and the characterisations are quite decent (despite the contrived gay aspect).<br />So what's the story about?  It concerns a young, newly gay-enlightened woman in NYC being chased by an obsessive middle-aged bachelor.  Coincidentally this middle-aged bachelor finds a wallet in the street owned by an artist.  This artist's wife has some lesbian tendencies.  All the characters then mesh together and, well, that's pretty much it.  As I mentioned above, the ending is rather poor.<br />As an aside, Highsmith has done a MUCH better story concerning lesbians in her classic 'Carol'.  That book is strongly recommended regardless of the reader's gender or gender preference.<br />Bottom line: 'Found is the Street' is really a forgettable piece of lesbian-mystery nonsense.  Yet it is generally well-written, and I suspect Highsmith fans will find it okay.	2002-04-10

Saylor's novels are best read in sequence.<br />As for Rubicon, we have Gordianus caught up in a power struggle between Pompey and Caesar.  He is pulled from Rome with Pompey's entourage and soon finds himself at a mighty battle at the harbour of what is now Brindisi.  The battles scenes are enthralling.  Better still, Rubicon has a surprise ending - no spoilers here!  And he does a nice job in providing a lead-in into the next book the in the series, Last Seen in Massilia.<br />Bottom line: amongst the best in the Roma Sub Rosa series.  Thoroughly enjoyable.	2002-04-08

One literary critic describes Colin Bateman as Ulster's (Northern Island's) equivalent of Carl Hiaasen.  Being a fan of Hiaasen I can see his point.  Bateman has a way of delivering great satiric humour is his (relatively) light mystery novels.  But unlike Hiaasen, he doesn't seem to be overly negative and bitter (..sometimes Hiaasen seems to hate most everything).<br />In Cycle of Violence we have the story of newspaperman being exiled to a rather nasty outpost (a town called Crossmaheart) to cover the usual reports of rape, murder and gang warfare.  He is actually filling a post left vacant when some ambitious journalist disappears and is presumed dead.  Things get interesting when he by chance develops a relationship with the missing journalist's girlfriend, and he discovers this woman has a rather bizarre past (, present ... and the future seems dubious too).<br />Bottom line: a funny, breezy read.  I hope its USA publishers decide to issue it in paperback.  It's every bit as good as Bateman's earlier (and more famous) Divorcing Jack.	2002-04-03

Carl Hiaasen can produce some wickedly funny fiction.  Some of his one-liners, although frequently quite rude, are hilarious.  And some of his characterizations and story lines, such as in his 'Strip Tease' and 'Skin Tight', are very well-crafted indeed.  But sadly, too often Hiaasen seems to recycle characters and plots ... as with Sick Puppy.<br />'Sick Puppy' is much like Hiaasen's 'Native Tongue', 'Tourist Season', and 'Double Whammy'.  In fact, all three seem like identical clones.  The stories involve corrupt politicians and businessmen who willfully or negligently trash the Florida ecosystem, with eco-warriors (including Hiaasen's favorite: Skink, an ex-Florida governor) battling to save the day.  Yes, all funny enough.  But I get the sense Hiaasen has either gotten lazy or is suffering from writer's block.  Will he ever return to the form he had when he wrote the brilliant 'Skin Tight'?<br />Bottom line: competent, funny ... but very deja vu.	2002-03-30

Patricia Highsmith is known for her tightly-woven psychological mysteries, especially where anxiety levels of the accused criminal approach the breaking point.  Ms Highsmith has also published many short stories of lesser quality, mostly because she has a shorter runway for building the suspense.  Having said this, her short story collection 'Eleven' does have nice juicy bits.<br />In 'Tales of Natural and Unnatural Catastrophes' Paticia Highsmith turns her attention to modern issues (eg, pollution) and writes some rather strange stories where these issues are turned upside-down.  I would broadly classify them has horror rather than mystery/suspense, and they are quite readable.  Yet one gets the impression that this is all very old hat.  And this material relects the general demise of Highsmith's works during the latter part of her career (1980s onwards).<br />Bottom line: okay, but Highsmith has done much better than this.	2002-03-25

For a person who does not like your Cold War spy novels I must admit that The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon is one of those rare books I consider to be simply brilliant.  It is concise, very well-written, and has a story which is absolutely incredible (well okay, by today's standards it might be considered a bit over-the-top).<br />In The Manchurian Candidate we have a US platoon in Korea (during the war) captured by Chinese/Russian scientists who brainwash them.  One sargeant in particular is targetted to be their assassin on demand after the war.  This fellow happens to have a power-hungry mother (..to be kind; she is truly vile) and her bozo husband who is modelled after the commie-hating Senator McCarthy.  From here the story gets more complex and interwoven, with a truly shocking and brilliant ending.<br />Bottom line: upon finishing this book you'll say \\"boy, that was GOOD\\".  Compulsory reading.<br />(compared with the film adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate, the novel is superior ... as is often the case.  However the film does capture the essence of the book albeit in a somewhat diluted fashion.)	2002-03-21

The Black Path of Fear is formulaic (read: okay, but not a classic) Woolrich crime novel.  As usual we have a lead character under duress, with Woolrich turning up the heat.  Predictable?  Yes, generally.  However Woolrich treats us with a rather surprising ending.<br />The story is simple.  A down-and-out guy gets a job as a gardener for a rich Miami gangster (timeframe: circa 1940).  He gets into a brief relationship with the gangster's wife, and both escape to Havana.  Naturally things go badly, and our leading man finds himself running through the seedy parts of Havana to escape capture from the police.  His saviour is a most unusual Cuban woman (a compassionate criminal with extreme hatred of the police).  Along the way we are treated with encounters by masochistic thugs, drug smugglers and opium addicts.<br />Bottom line: an enjoyable, escapist read.  Worth a look.	2002-03-18

I did not want to read a half-baked mystery novel and endless episodes of Stephanie Plum wrecking her car.  Thankfully and surprisingly, Seven Up is actually one of the better books in the series.<br />In Seven Up the author decided not over-reach her skills by cooking up a contrived mystery, or have our bounty hunter babe (Stephanie Plum) tour greater Trenton for multiple bail-jumpers.  Instead we have a rather basic yet interesting and understandable (!) mystery involving a missing geriatric (a rather perverted old man with a shakey gun), his evil relatives, and the \\"dumb and dumber\\" twosome (Dougie and Mooner) from earlier novels.  And we are entertained by the introduction of Stephanie's \\"born again\\" lesbian sister and her \\"I think I'm a male horse\\" daughter.   .... oh, and as with High Five we are treated with a very teasing cliffhanger ending!<br />Bottom line: a very enjoyable installment of Stephanie Plum for her fans to enjoy.	2002-03-18

Perhaps more so than in his previous novels, A Murder on the Appian Way by Steven Saylor is really the telling of an historical (and epoch-making) event in ancient Rome with just a bit of fiction to sew it all together.  Our fictional sleuth Gordianus does very little here, which is sort of a shame (..in previous Saylor novels we've grown to love him and his family).  But the reader does gain a lot of insight to what made ancient Rome the way it was, for better or worse.<br />The actual murder (of Clodius) on Applian way is not terribly interesting ... it's more of a reckless accident.  But the political turmoil it creates is most interesting, and ultimately very upsetting to the Roman citizenry.  Many readers might find all this political in-fighting to rather dull, which is understandable.  However Saylor fans who have already read through his previous works should find it to be interesting enough.<br />Bottom line: historical fiction that is heavy on history, light on fiction.  Not Saylor's best, but the events told were truly historical.  Recommended.	2002-03-13

It is a rather simply story with few surprises. While its observations are keen, it does not reveal anything shocking - it's all rather genteel. One can consider it to be a lightweight version of material produced by the likes of Edith Wharton and F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br />Bottom line: a very competent but prosaic study of late Victorian-era American life and value. A worthy read.<br />(PS - despite its many accolades, I found the film version of The Magnificent Ambersons to be much weaker than the book.  Yet it makes for interesting viewing *after* reading the book.)	2002-03-08

Drowning Ruth is one of those psychological dramas involving somewhat inconsistent (and sometimes incoherent) recollections of long past tragic events and the ultimate unravelling of it all.  I felt a strong sense of deja vu (ie, didn't I experience all this before in some cheap made-for-TV movie?).  I suppose its one curious element is that one of its primary characters is a little girl (Ruth) who claims early on in the book that she drowned.<br />While this might all sound like unappetizing, it actually reads quite well.  The author does an admirable job of describing the rather bleak northern Wisconsin landscape and its people.  I suppose my only complaints are that the book does move at a somewhat slow pace, and its 'surprise' ending was no surprise to me at all.  But these are actually minor quibbles in what has to be considered a wonderful first novel by Christina Schwarz.<br />Bottom line: don't let the Oprah sticker on the front of the book turn you off.  Drowning Ruth is actually fine book.  Recommended.	2002-03-04

Firstly, if you haven't read any of Steven Saylor's mystery series set in ancient Rome then go directly to the customer reviews for 'Roman Blood'.  You must read his series in sequence or you'll regret it (much of the fine characterisations of Gordianus 'the Finder' and his family/friends/foes will be not fully appreciated).  So for those who have read Saylor's previous works ... read on.<br />Catilina's Riddle is textbook Saylor material, which means it is very well researched, well-written, and generally interesting.  In this installment we have a mystery surrounding a very intriguing *real* person from ancient Rome, Catilina.  He a lover of both women and men, is feared by the Roman elite, and in this novel he meets our favorite fictious sleuth - Gordianus.  However compared to other Saylor novels this book is somewhat overkill on the history lesson and too light on the mystery element.  Yes, it has its moments ... and it is a worthy read on balance.  But it is not as good as his previous works, and some of his later works.<br />Bottom line: a so-so effort by Saylor.  Nonetheless it should be considered as mandatory reading by his fans.	2002-02-26

True, they are very much 'girlie books'.  But in this genre they are rather polished pieces.<br />In 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' we have Bridget struggling with the man (Mark Darcy) she won in the first book.  A predatory femme fatale plus Bridget's unwarrented paranoia places this relationship in jeopardy.  Of course catty gossip and bizarre interludes (including a strange vacation to Thailand) makes this a funny yet harmless (and, alas, ultimately forgettable) read.<br />Bottom line: Helen Fielding decomposes the modern Brit 'chick' with panache.  Even guys can like this kind of book.	2002-02-20

'If You Really Loved Me' is a fascinating true life account of a young teenager who admits to killing her stepmother at the request of her father (..hence the title of the book).  Such an incredulous premise comes to life with Ann Rule's balanced, well-judged telling of the murderous incident, confessions, trials and post-mortems.  This is perhaps Ann Rule's best work after 'Stranger Beside Me'.<br />Too often Ann Rule's books seem to be promoted and packaged as something akin to a telemovie film script - that is, more like tabloid material than true journalism.  And sometimes the contents of Ann's books don't rise above the lurid packaging.  But 'If You Really Loved Me' is truly a moving, shocking story.  One can't help but feel empathy for the trusting daughter and total disgust for the manipulative daughter.<br />Strongly recommended.	2002-02-20

'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of those books shoved down the throats of American teens by the English teachers, as sort of elexir to cure rascism.  When I first read it (at age fourteen) I found it to be a difficult read, and not particularly enjoyable.  Rereading it some thirty years later I now see what all the fuss is about.<br />Firstly, this book is about the thoughts and activities of a young girl growing up in 1930s rural Alabama.  There is very much the innocence (and, ultimately, lost innocence) and wonder of youth in the Harper Lee's prose ... kind of a Dixie version of 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'.  Harper Lee's observations of the rascism and hypocritical society of the times are keenly judged.  My only complaint, albeit minor, is that her prose is too rich - it seems out of place (ie, too adult) for a story about adolescent girl.  This makes 'To Kill a Mockingbird' a deceptively inappropriate book for anyone under, say, seventeen years of age.<br />Bottom line: all the heartbreak of youth during turbulent times exquisitely told.  Worth rereading (time and time again).	2002-02-20

Firstly, readers of this review who have not read any of Saylor's novels should proceed directly to 'Roman Blood', the first of the Gordianus mystery series (set in ancient Rome).  Saylor's books are best read in sequence in order to capture the essence of its private eye hero (Gordianus the finder).<br />Unlike the other Gordianus novels, The Venus Throw is a mystery involving murder and intrique close to and in (!) the Gordianus household.  An old Egyptian friend of Gordianus is murdered and, of course, Gordianus is hired to find the killer.  The outcome is very surprising, and all along we are entertained by Saylor's excellent prose.  And true to form, Saylor also sprinkles in copious sauciness (orgies, boys behaving badly, etc) without being crude.<br />Bottom line: one of the best of a fine historical mystery series.  Highly recommended.	2002-02-11

Cornell Woolrich certainly has some comparative \\"duds\\" in his long collection of mystery novels and stories.  The Black Curtain can be considered a dud because of its contrived story, but as with all Woolrich stories it is still very readable ... in a B movie sort of way.<br />The Black Curtain is about a man with amnesia who, inexplicably, has forgotten about the previous three years of his life.  He gradually pieces back what has transpired, which includes the shock that he is wanted for murder.  In the end he strives to exonerate himself. ...no the story isn't believable, leaving many unanswered questions, but it is engaging.<br />Bottom line: a book probably best left to Woolrich completists only.	2002-02-05

I'm a middle-aged man hooked on Stephanie Plum mysteries (by Janet Evanovich).  The characters are colorful and, to a great extent, believable.  The dialogue is sharp, complete with modern slang used to a comical effect.  However what differentiates each Stephanie Plum novel from the other is story (ie, the mystery element).  Sometimes it's good, other times not so good ... as with 'Hot Six'.<br />In 'Hot Six' we have Latino-commando-stud Ranger in big trouble.  He is suspected of murder and, of course, it is up to Stephanie Plum to prove his innocence.  Sounds promising enough, but actually the story is pretty flat.  And Evanovich is a bit too economical with the cleaver one-liners.  Still, as always, the book is very readable in a breezy sort of way; you can't get better beach-reading material than this.<br />Bottom line: a dud by Evanovich's standards is still lots of fun.  I eagerly await for her latest book to be issued in paperback form ... so I can take it to the beach!	2002-02-04

For those who love DisneyWorld, Epcot and the other Florida 'kingdoms' I must warn you that Carl Hiaasen, the native Floridian who hates just about everything worth hating, tears apart the organisers and operators of these eco-unfriendly institutions with 'Native Tongue'.  Fans of Carl Hiaasen will be pleased to know that some of his favorite characters from his other books, include the unforgettable Skink, live on in this book.  However for this Hiaasen fan I found 'Native Tongue' to be surprisingly flat.<br />Hiaasen's books normally contain a complicated and outrageous plot, bizarre characters and great one-liners.  However in 'Native Tongue' we have a plot centered on a fictious south Florida theme park where renegade environmentalists try to overthrow its crooked owner.  Complicated?  No.  Outrageous?  Marginally.  Bizarre characters abound, but Hiaasen has forgetten to give them the one-liners which so enliven his other works.<br />Bottom line: a passably enjoyable read but Hiaasen fans will be somewhat disappointed.  Hiaasen neophytes should start with 'Skin Tight' instead.	2002-01-26

'The Lady in the Lake' by Raymond Chandler is one of those mystery novels you either love or hate: a murder mystery becomes more and more twisted as a super sleuth, in this case Chandler's Philip Marlowe character, almost magically answers all questions to the amazement of the reader.  Regardless, this novel is certainly well-written ... complete with crackling dialogue and interesting characters.<br />The story is very complicated.  Yes, a corpse of a young woman is found in a lake.  But there are actually multiple interwoven murders involved, tainted with adultery, drug usage, and greed.  Philipe Marlowe is hired not to solve any murder but to actually find the missing wife of a rich businessman.  He certainly gets knee-deep into problems and, of course in the end, gets out unscathed.<br />Bottom line: a tightly written mystery that almost defies belief.  Great reading enjoyment.	2002-01-20

I'm not sure why this book is called &quot;Arms of Nemesis: A Novel of Ancient Rome&quot; since nearly the entire story is located in a villa near modern Naples, not Rome.  Regardless, this second book in the Gordianus series has all the goodness we expect from Saylor: good story, compulsively readable prose, and good bits of Roman-era history thrown in.<br />In this book we have Gordianus, our favorite Roman private eye, hired to find the murderer of a caretaker of a seaside villa.  The murderer is presumed to be one of victim's slaves, and so as punishment the villa's owner threatens to kill all slaves at the estate.  This comes at a very ticklish time when southern Italy was grappling with slave unrest, courtesy of Spartacus.  The story is generally believable, and we are treated with a host of curious characters.  Very enjoyable.<br />However my only gripe with the novel is its heavy references to homosexuality, complete with a romance between a military officer and a slave.  While Saylor does handle this subject with panache and good taste, I am not convinced all this gay context reflects Roman history - Saylor makes no mention of it as part of his historical references.  However I do know Saylor has a previous life of a writer of gay erotica (under an assumed name), and so I fear the gay subplot and copious references to naked men might reflect wishful thinking on the part of Saylor on how things might have been, but not as how they actually were.<br />Bottom line: a well-written historical novel with fine characterisations.  Recommended.	2002-01-18

Reading 'Touching the Void' by Joe Simpson I was left with some very strong impressions, most of which are probably not what the author intended.  Firstly, the book is full of jargon not used outside of the niche world of climbers; I found myself looking up many words in the dictionary (hint to Simpson: how about having a glossary in the next edition of the book?).  Secondly, the book reads like nothing more than a collection of glib diary entries.  Fine for the likes of Anne Frank, but this book would have been a better if written by someone else (hint to Simpson: climbing mountains and writing books don't mix).  Lastly, I am ASTOUNDED at how such an obviously intelligent man like Joe Simpson got himself into such a horrific mess climbing a mountain ... with the end result he is left with injuries he'll live (and suffer) with the rest of his life.  I did NOT get the feeling &quot;gee Joe, you're one helluva survivor&quot;.  You shouldn't have gotten into the life-threatening situation in the first place.<br />For those who haven't guessed, this book is the real-life adventure of Joe Simpson as he and a friend climb an icy peak in South America.  Even though both individuals have climbing experience, both acted wrecklessly (IMHO) whilst on the climb.  Joe suffers a serious fall and, no doubt enduring pain that perhaps only a holocaust victim can relate to, manages to make it back on his own.  Inspiring?  No doubt for some, but not so for this reader.<br />Bottom line: the book delivers both &quot;how not to climb mountains&quot; and &quot;never, EVER give up&quot; messages.  Unfortunately it is not well-written.  Perhaps best left to climbers and, more so, wannable climbers.	2002-01-14

Four to Score is the fourth installment of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum crime series.  It is also the fifth book in the series that I have read (..I was naughty and started with book five).  True to form, we have our delightful bounty hunter babe chasing some nasties around greater Trenton whilst dealing with her wacky friends and family.  But does Four to Score stand out in any way?  Well...<br />In Four to Score we have a fairly light mystery involving counterfeiting and some nasty behaviour (shootings, firebombing, mutilation).  The story itself is rather forgettable.  However in Four to Score the author introduces a new character, a 6'4&quot; transvestite who really livens up the story.  And last, and probably least, Stephanie Plum finally &quot;does it&quot; with Morelli, the heartthrob of the Trenton police force.  However I must warn any guys reading Four to Score: Evanovich's description of Stephanie's lust and her actual sexual encounter is, while not very explicit, has the feel of what would be in (or I imagine to be in) a Jackie Collins' novel.  This is a shame because I had felt until now Evanovich's novels are really suitable to either gender despite being marketed towards women (..the UK edition of Four to Score has an all-'shocking pink' cover).<br />Bottom line: lukewarm mystery compensating by some very colourful characterisations.  Not Evanovich's best, but fans will gobble it up.  Recommended.	2002-01-09

The Killer Angels is a fictionalised account of the Battle of Gettysburg.  It is told quite effectively from the perspective of key officers from both sides of the battle.  And for anyone who knows anything about this battle, it makes for sobering reading.  One is left with nothing but a genuine sense of pity for all those involved.<br />For myself personally, a Yankee with very little knowledge or (until now) appreciation of the US Civil War, The Killer Angels really brought home the message that generals in a war &quot;play God&quot; with soldiers.  In the Battle of Gettysburg thousands of lives were lost due to the incompetence and the hyperactive ego of a certain general and his staff.  Such a terrible, terrible waste.<br />My only minor complaint of this (very readable and enjoyable) novel is Shaara's slight tendency to over-romanticise matters and downplay the utter gruesomeness of war.  Thousands of dead and dying men and horses must of been an utterly appalling site.  Yet I didn't sense the magnitude of this travesty from reading Shaara's words.<br />Bottom line: a very good, educational reading experience.  Strongly recommended.	2002-01-07

His novels consist of characters that have the look, feel and sound of B-movie gangsters.  Yet his stories always contains at least one character that is either extraordinarily vile or pathetic (a hapless loser).<br />In The Grifters we are entertained by three rotten individuals: a &quot;nickel-dime&quot; con artist (&quot;grifter&quot;), his equally crooked youthful mother, and his older girlfriend who'll do just about anything for money.  It's the interplay between these characters rather than the crime themselves which are most fascinating.  In effect each character tries to manipulate the other to his/her pure selfish advantage.  Love?  You won't find any in this book.  Oh, and the ending is really g-o-o-d.<br />Bottom line: sleazy, depressing yet utterly compelling.  Amongst Thompson's finer works.<br />(The film adaptation of The Grifters is also highly recommended.)	2002-01-02

The Killer Inside Me, a slick novel about a psychotic deputy sheriff in a small Texan town, is perhaps Jim Thompson's best known and most admired work.  Several years later he wrote Pop. 1280, a story about, hmmm..., a psychotic sheriff in a small town.  Deja vu?  Yeah, sort of.  But there are differences...<br />Unlike The Killer Inside Me, our monster law enforcement officer is not a compulsive killer but rather a hideously clever womanizer who quite thoroughly justifies his dirty deeds ... albeit using very twisted logic.  The man comes off as a lazy idiot to all around him, yet he is incredibly sly and evil.  Most of Pop. 1280 makes for great reading, with only the ending being somewhat flat.<br />Bottom line: amongst Jim Thompson's better works, which means it stands head and shoulders beyond other 'noir' mystery novels.  Recommended.	2002-01-02

Skin Tight is a classic roller-coaster comic mystery by that Carl \\"Florida - paradise lost\\" Hiaasen.  His satire has never been so caustic, or so humorous.  Some folks might find it all a bit cruel and, if you've read anything else by Hiaasen, a bit repetitive.  Yet Skin Tight delivers belly laughs, which has to be a good thing.<br />As for the (complicated and over-the-top) plot, we have an incredibly crooked and incompetent plastic surgeon suspected of killing a patient and disposing of the body (in a very creative fashion).  As the police and other interested parties come down on this surgeon he employs very colorful thugs to eliminate these troublemakers ... yet everything goes wrong.  On top of this he has a Hispanic shock-TV host (similarities to Geraldo Rivera are probably intentional) wanting to capture this ... on live television.  Everything spins wildly out of control.  Yet the vibrant characterizations, the clever one-liners, and cruel attacks on these rich, selfish and vain individuals make Skin Tight very enjoyable.  And unlike his other works, the story is not too Florida-centric (although it takes place in Miami) ... and so it should be enjoyable to most everyone who is familiar with American popular culture.<br />Bottom line: sick, twisted and very funny.  Perhaps Hiaasen's best.  Strongly recommended.	2001-12-31

The Getaway is vintage Jim Thompson: a short, bleak story of 1950s down-and-outs, deadbeats and criminals.  Much of his novels are heavy on punchy, &quot;in your face&quot; dialogue which would make fans of traditional fine literature cringe.  It has a movie script feel about it which, for this reader, makes the story more intense.<br />In The Getaway we have a married pair of ex-cons making a getaway from a rather botched bank robbery.  Neither person is pretty or especially likeable.  Yet their desperate plight to make a getaway is fascinating ... and they go about matters in a very rough-handed fashion (cold-blooded murders abound).  Yet in the end they come to the realization their getaway will not gain them any sense of happiness or closure.  The ending (..no spoilers here) is most poignant.  If our &quot;Bonnie and Clyde wannabes&quot; weren't such a heartless couple I'd almost feel sorry for them.<br />Bottom line: no, not Jim Thompson's best (which is The Killer Inside Me).  But he was certainly on top form when he wrote The Getaway.  Highly recommended.<br />(and no, I've never seen any film adaptation of The Getaway)	2001-12-28

Carl Hiaasen is a man who seems to hate so many things: corrupt politicians, polluters, cheats, racists, and hypocrites.  This hatred, which usually manifests itself as hilarious satire, does get a bit old as one reads more than 2-3 Hiaasen novels.  Yet if Hiaasen is on form the number of one-liners and hilarious situations greatly outweigh the repetitiveness of the material.  Unfortunately for the Double Whammy reader, Hiaasen was not on best form when he wrote this book.<br />Double Whammy is Hiaasen's take on the crazy world of the obsessed bass fisherman and the promoters of the sport.  Tied into all this is murder, hypocritical tele-evangelists, and a gallery of very strange people.  No, it is not believable ... and nor is it intended to be (well, not really).  There are some very funny moments in the book, especially towards the end.  Yet while reading it I seem to recall similar scenarios in Hiaasen's other (and better) works such as Strip Tease.  Still, it makes for a pleasant if utterly forgettable read.<br />Bottom line: Hiaasen newbies are advised to read Strip Tease.  Yet Hiaasen fans might very well enjoy Double Whammy, especially if they are into bass fishing.	2001-12-28

However with this book Ann Rule really fails to deliver unbiased journalism which, ultimately, made me rather disappointed.<br />Small Sacrifices is the story of a the shooting of three small children, and their very strange (, sick, twisted) mother (Diane Downs) who is accused of the crime.  Ann Rule does a wonderful job detailing the events surrounding the shootings, and then tells us ALL about the mother - eg, I now know her nipples cracked and bled while breast feeding one of her kids - ugh!.  This is all rather fascinating.  BUT then the mother goes on trial and, for this reader, the book makes a turn for the worse.  For many reasons (..no spoilers here) I found the trial to be a miscarriage of justice - or rather, it was simply an unfair trial.  Worse, Ann Rule only details what the prosecution went through in preparing and executing the case.  She doesn't mention anything about the defense, other than how the defense attorney is dressed.  In the end I felt rather sorry for the mother, which I'm sure isn't what Ann Rule intented for her readers to feel - after all, Diane Downs is indeed a psychotic individual and, undoubtedly, a mother from hell.<br />Bottom line: Ann Rule is most effective when sticking to the facts on BOTH SIDES of a criminal trial.  Unfortunately she fails with Small Sacrifices.  Recommended to Ann Rule fans only.	2001-12-27

The Black Angel has a wonderful premise: a married man is falsely convicted of murdering his mistress, with his wife then doing everything conceivable to find the real killer.  And Cornell Woolrich certainly has the credentials for writing wonderful &quot;noire&quot; mysteries.  But The Black Angel falls flat, at least for this reader.  Why??  Well...<br />The Black Angel is in many ways a series of short stories.  Our wife/heroine goes through the mistress/victim's &quot;little black book&quot; to find who might be the real murder.  In effect each chapter of the book is a separate mini-story of the heroine confronting some strange (and sometimes dangerous) man.  While each mini-story in by itself is often interesting, not enough time is really afforded for character development; it all goes by so quickly and, most often, unsatisfactorily.  However The Black Angel is partially redeemed by a good (and surprising) ending.<br />Bottom line: not one of Woolrich's better efforts, although Woolrich fans will probably find some enjoyment from it.  For Woolrich neophytes I recommend starting with one of his classics (such as Waltz Into Darkness).	2001-12-20

'Roman Blood' is an excellent example of historical fiction where the words 'historical' and 'fiction' are given equal attention. Steven Saylor spins a &quot;whodunnit&quot; mystery based on real events, much like Margaret Atwood does in her excellent 'Alias Grace'.  This is unlike the work of Lindsey Davis, an author whose popular Falco mystery series, while in a similar ancient Rome setting, is pure fiction (although the author clearly knows her Roman history).<br />As for the story, hmmm... it's a bit complicated.  Broadly speaking it is about a private eye (Gordianus) who is hired by a defense attorney (Cicero) to investigate the bloody death of a Roman citizen.  The victim's son is accused of planning the murder and, if convicted, would suffer a most extraordinarily gruesome execution.  In the end we witness the murder trial and its aftermath, both of which are rather ... surprising.  Yet before then the reader is taken through the very colorful day-to-day events of Roman high-lifes and low-lifes; I found it all to be very educational, and the murder mystery element is very well presented.<br />Compared to the works of Lindsey Davis, 'Roman Blood' is somewhat dry - it doesn't contain much humor, and the characterizations, while completely satisfactory, do not sparkle.  Yet I actually prefer the work of Steven Saylor because of its historical accuracy and I find his prose to be richer (ie, it feels more like 'literature' versus 'popular fiction').<br />Bottom line: not quite James Michener material, but nonetheless a very accomplished piece of historical fiction.  Recommended.	2001-12-17

A Dog's Ransom is classic Patricia Highsmith - that is, it is a study of how feelings of apprehension and fear overwhelm the guilty (or persons suspected of guilt).  Despite its title, the book has little to do with dogs or ransom really ... although this is where the story begins.<br />In this novel we have a middle-aged couple in Manhatten whose little poodle is kidnapped by a mentally disturbed loner.  Having reported the crime, the police are unattentive with the exception of a &quot;do gooder&quot; rookie.  However soon this rookie, due to incompetence and personal weaknesses, gets over his head ... and soon finds himself in big trouble.  Despite its slow (and somewhat contrived) beginning, the tension builds very nicely. And the ending is rather ... upsetting.<br />Bottom line: amongst Highsmith's better works despite a relatively low &quot;wow!&quot; factor.  Strongly recommended for Highsmith fans.  Highsmith neophytes are advised to first read her more famous works (The Talented Mr Ripley, Strangers on a Train, ..).	2001-12-13

What really shines through is his bitter satire with a comic touch; very wicked indeed!  One also has to be impressed with how the prose and (often crude) langauge flow so well - Tourist Season is an effortless read.<br />As for the plot, well here things are a bit messy.  The story involves a hapless gang of 'revolutionaries' looking to chase out all tourists and snowbirds from south Florida because, well, south Florida was much nicer before all this development stuff started.  Caught in action are sleazy Miami city officials, crazy newspaper writers, a beauty queen and, of course, a few tourists who fall victim to these revolutionaries.  Actually, this 'mess' is a lot of fun but it does run out of steam towards the end ... by which time I felt tired of Hiaasen's &quot;gee, I hate everyone who moved to south Florida after me!&quot; attitude.  Having said this, much of his sarcasm is very well focused.<br />Bottom line: a delightful, non-stop attack on Miami and the uglier side of Americans.  While perhaps some of the humor is too American-centric for folks this side of the Atlantic, all others will find much to enjoy with Tourist Season.  Recommended.<br />(PS - Hiaasen's later works, such as Strip Tease, is even better.)	2001-12-10

'Silver Pigs', the first of the Falco mystery series, is my first book by Lindsey Davis. I had expectations of a tight mystery set in ancient Rome which would prove entertaining, humorous, and educational. Were my expectations met? Well, not exactly.<br />'Silver Pigs' is a historical mystery novel with a very light touch. We are introduced to a bumbling yet totally likeable investigator (Falco) who is tasked to find out who is stealing ingots from the government. Falco travels to where the precious metal is mined (in England), falls in love, gets his heart broken, and meets all sorts of nasty people ... all in a day's work. Believable? Hardly. Enjoyable? Well the author does make her detective hero character into a charmer, so it is a pleasent enough read. But I found it to be a generally unfulfilling experience. I didn't learn much about ancient Rome, none of the other characters were well developed, the humour in the novel was merely cute rather than funny, and the prose was not particularly strong. Not a bad read, just an entirely forgettable one.<br />Bottom line: a trifling novel which doesn't take any chances, leaving this reader unenthused (I will not read any of the other Falco novels). Not recommended.	2001-12-06

But this can also be said of Dennis Wheatley's other occult novels.  Great entertainment value, but little in the way of believability.<br />In this book we have a wealthy man, Sir Gifford, who finds that he has an 'out of body' experience in the most literal sense.  His spirit, or 'ka', has escaped from his body and wanders around southern England (...don't ask! these things just happen :-)).  Actually the circumstances behind this (murders and mayhem) are rather interesting, as is Sir Gifford's efforts to get his ka back into his body.  (...remember, I didn't say this book ranked high on the believability index)  At any rate, the story does move at a quick pace and does have some entertaining/interesting moments, especially in the end.<br />Bottom line: certainly an odd fish in the world of literature.  But Wheatley was like a Stephen King from our father's (or grandfather's) generation, so his works deserve some respect.  This even includes 'The Ka of Gifford Hillary', a quirky fable which is only 'average Wheatley' (best left to Wheatley fans only).	2001-12-03

'The Killer Inside Me' is my first taste of Jim Thompson, and it certainly delivers what the title says.  The writing style is something like Horace McCoy and James M. Cain, but the language and setting is rural west Texas (..it sounds much like the Midland/Odessa area).  In short the book is full of punchy dialogue, some of which is surprisingly crude/vulgar (for a book written in the early 1950s), and the story is compact yet forceful.<br />'The Killer Inside Me' is the story of deputy sheriff in a small (fictitious) Texan oil town.  He narrates his thoughts and actions in controlling, and mostly not controlling, his inner rage which leads to murder.  He is cold, calculating, and very intelligent.  His behaviour is horrific, but fortunately Jim Thompson spares us from the technicolor graphics (as opposed to the more recent 'American Psycho' novel, based on a broadly similar story).  So 'The Killer Inside Me', while a shocking and depressing read, is not like reading the screenplay of a slasher flick.<br />Bottom line: a simple story brilliantly told.  We get to enter the mind of a homocidal maniac, witness his dirty deeds, and are left speechless.  Strongly recommended.	2001-11-27

While folks reading this review have probably read the first three Ripley novels and will probably read the fourth (The Boy Who Followed Ripley) regardless of what I write, let me just say a few words on what to expect.  Having read some 20+ Patricia Highsmith novels I have alternated between being a raving fan and a semi-harsh critic of her work.  When she is good, she is very good indeed.  When she has an off day, her material is just ho-hum.  I'm afraid The Boy Who Followed Ripley falls into the latter category.<br />The Boy Who Followed Ripley has just an interesting premise.  A sixteen year-old American rich lad seeks out our rogue Tom Ripley and befriends him.  We discover the boy has a dark secret, which he shares exclusively with Ripley.  The boy's friendship extends into something like hero-worshipping.  At this stage Highsmith could have used some clever homo-erotic angle, which would have been an interesting twist back to the original The Talented Mr Ripley novel, or at least made the boy into some sort of threat to Tom Ripley (..a man with many secrets).  But no, the author merely injects some rather unoriginal mystery/criminal handy-panky which involves with boy and Tom Ripley.  The only curious bit is that Tom Ripley is the good guy here, which is a bit of disappointment for the fans of the Ripley series.<br />On a much more minor note, I was unfortunate enough to read a 5-6 year old UK version of this novel.  The publisher took liberties in translating many expressions into British slang, which is really appalling since the two main characters in this novel are Americans.  It is downright bizarre to read a book where Americans use words like loo (toilet), pissed (drunk) and fag (cigarette).  This is the first time I witnessed this in a UK edition Highsmith novel; I hope the most current edition of The Boy Who Followed Ripley is spared from this nonsense.<br />Bottom line: a very readable, but very mundane Ripley book.  Disappointing and, sadly, not recommended.	2001-11-26

'Strip Tease' by Carl Hiaasen might be better known through the rather horrendous Demi Moore film 'Striptease', which is a shame. It was because of its relationship to the film that I avoided reading anything from Hiaasen.  But the reviews in amazon.com were so overwhelmingly positive I decided to take the gamble.  And boy, am I glad I did.  'Strip Tease' is a delight.<br />'Strip Tease' is a somewhat farcical story of a stripper with a heart, doing her dirty business only to put bread on the table and pay back debts related to a (losing) custody battle with her hoodlum ex-husband over their daughter.  Our stripper heroine has the most wacky friends and associates, and is caught up into a political murder/sex scandal involving a rather perverted congressman.  Surprising, the story holds together well despite sounding much like a cheap made-for-TV film script. However it is Hiaasen's well-timed one-liners and satiric/sarcastic wit which really makes 'Strip Tease' shine; this book is seriously funny.<br />Bottom line: South Florida at its worst, and its funniest.  Hiaasen puts together a comedic mystery with a nasty bite.  Recommended.	2001-11-23

Not one for following convention, I have just read the first of the Stephanie Plum series after reading the fifth, second and third (..in that order).  Being greatly impressed with High Five, a trifle bit less impressed with Three To Get Deadly, and non-plussed with Two For The Dough, I was concerned that Janet Evanovich's series simply improved with each new Stephanie Plum novel ... and One For The Money might be a comparative dud.  Glad to say, I was wrong.<br />One For The Money is the first Stephanie Plum adventure, and we learn how Stephanie makes the unusual career change from a buyer at a down-market ladies underwear retailer to a bounty hunter.  We also get to meet the lovable yet crazy people in her life, including her wacky family.  Janet Evanovich keeps the one-liners flowing as we are treated to a very good little mystery where her ex-boyfriend cop is wrongly accused of pre-meditated murder.  The sexual tension, always pervasive (yet not crude) in Evanovich's novels, is palpable ... to a very humourous effect.<br />Bottom line: a great intro into charming world of Stephanie Plum. Guys, don't judge these Stephanie Plum books by their flashy, 'girlie' appearances.  (The UK versions of these books makes it a downright embarassment for a guy to be seen reading them.) These books are great fun for readers of either sex.	2001-11-20

Mildred Pierce is one of those 'tough as nails, heart of gold' mothers who should an inspiration to all women.  She kicks out her dead-beat husband, works her tail off to keep food on the table and her daughters happy, and has the guts/brains to start her own successful business.  So what's wrong (and why did James M. Cain bother to write about her)?<br />Unable to face reality, Mildred is the victim of her own blindness to her rotten eldest daughter's ways.  Not only is her daughter unappreciative, she actually ridicules her mother as being some uncouth and ignorant embarassment.  Mildred's toughness melts when confronting her monster daughter, much to her detriment.  While a heartbreaking story overall, the ending is especially moving ... have your hankies ready.<br />Perhaps many folks reading this review has seen the famous film adaption (starring Joan Crawford) of Mildred Pierce.  While the film generally carries the intent of James M. Cain's written word, there are several differences.  Obviously Hollywood wanted to over-dramatize, or simply invent scenes.  As much as I like the movie I enjoyed the book more; I found it to be more personal , intense and believable.<br />Bottom line: required reading by all mothers, strongly recommended to everyone else.	2001-11-19

Many folks regard Dennis Wheatley as the author of 'The Devil Rides Out' and other occult fiction which can perhaps be described as &quot;over the top&quot;.  Nearly all his books are out of print, so one might assume that the works of Dennis Wheatley are best forgotten.  This is unfortunate because, at least with 'The Haunting of Toby Jugg', Dennis Wheatley has produced some very innovative works of horror.<br />'The Haunting of Toby Jugg' is the story of a young man, crippled during the war, being held captive by his guardian.  Poor Toby suffers from extremely emotional distress because of his nightly visits by some shadowy creatures.  Is Toby going insane or is his guardian behind all this?  For much of the novel we don't know.  The story has the feel of 'Misery' by Stephen King.  It is taut, well-paced ... without excessive mini-lectures on satanism usually found in Wheatley novels.<br />In addition, 'The Haunting of Toby Jugg' is written as series of diary entries.  So it has a personal, psychological feel to it much along the lines of 'Dracula' (Bram Stoker) and 'The Woman in White' (Wilkie Collins).<br />Bottom line: works well as a psychological &quot;captive vs captor&quot; novel.  Of course there is the sprinkling of Wheatley's absurd satanist nonsense to contend with, but overall the book is a real page-turner.  Recommended.	2001-11-15

After reading a relatively disappointing Two for the Dough, the second installment of the Stephanie Plum series, I was apprehensive about starting the third ... even though I was a bad boy and have already read the fifth installment (High Five), which I loved.  Was I disappointed with Three to Get Deadly?  Not at all!<br />In Three to Get Deadly, differing from Two for the Dough, the reader gets teased about Stephanie Plum's (, our lovable bounty hunter from Trenton,) love life; very soap operatic, but hilarious.  In addition and more importantly, Three to Get Deadly also contains a real good page-turner mystery.  It's hard to relate the story without giving away spoilers, but suffice to say Stephanie is out to get her neighborhood's ice cream man who has jumped bail on a relatively minor offense.  Everyone in Trenton loves this old, cuddly man who has been a neighborhood institution for generations.  So every hates Stephanie for trying to track him done.  Little to they realise our lovable grandpa character is not the sort person people take him for...<br />Bottom line: not quite High Five material, but still a funny and engaging read.  At this stage I hope there is really a Stephanie Plum out there.  I'd love to meet her and do lunch. :-)	2001-11-08

The Devil Rides Out is perhaps best known for its late 1960s screen adaptation starring Christopher Lee.  It's because of this that folks seem to recall Dennis Wheatley as the guy who wrote The Devil Rides Out.  For a man who has pumped out more than sixty novels in his life, this is a rather sad legacy.<br />The Devil Rides out is follows roughly the same formula as other Dennis Wheatley's &quot;Black Magic&quot; novels.  Devil worshippers recruit unsuspecting nice guys into their satanic rituals, with some amateur sleuths chasing down these villians before all hell breaks loose (..pun intended).  Dennis Wheatley of course can't resist offering mini-lectures on the history of the occult too, proving that he really was an authority on the matter.<br />So does The Devil Ride Out offer reading pleasure?  Well, firstly the novel was written in the 1930s but feels much older; it evokes images of mothballs, gaslight, and worn cardigans.  Compared to Wheatley's The Satanist, written some 25 years later, it seems very archaic indeed.  Secondly, the story itself is not very enthralling.  Wheatley is known as a storyteller, but not as a great writer of literature.  So The Devil Rides Out suffers from both poor writing and a lame story.  At least The Satanist has a much better story; I think to a degree Wheatley got better with age and experience.<br />Bottom line: a musty, dusty piece of gothic nonsense.  Wheatley has written better 'black magic' novels; he was sort of a Stephen King back some 30+ years ago.  It's best to hunt down those novels (which are, sadly, out of print).	2001-11-05

Two for the Dough is my second Stephanie Plum detective novel, after having made the mistake of reading Evanovich's later High Five first.  Why was it a mistake?  Well...<br />Firstly for those unaware, Stephanie Plum is like a Bridget Jones except she is from New Jersey ... and she is a bounty hunter.  When you think of it, it is a very funny scenario.  Not only is Stephanie Plum hilarious, but her co-workers and family are zany in a lovable way.<br />Two for the Dough basically tells of a mildly interesting mystery where Stephanie is trying to apprehend a rather psychotic individual and has to deal with sliced-off body parts, missing coffins, and stolen assault weapons in the process.  Actually, it sounds better than it reads.  Unlike High Five, Two for the Dough concentrates too much on this a single-threaded mystery and not enough on Stephanie's (hilarious) personal life.  High Five has the great one-liners, Two for the Dough does not.<br />Bottom line: High Five is a MUST read; think of it as a Stephanie Plum novel polished to perfection.  Two for the Dough is an optional stepping stone along the way in the Stephanie Plum series; it yields smiles but few laughs.	2001-11-01

Little did I realise when I purchased it, The Poisonwood Bible is actually two novels.  The first two-thirds is a story about a missionary and his family's life in the wilds of Belgian congo, while the remaining third is basically a post-mortem of this experience.  Did I receive a bargain for getting two books for the price of one?<br />The life of the missionary and his family (wife and four daughters) in Belgian Congo is told as an interwoven narrative by all family members with the notable exception of the father.  It seems the entire family is subjected to poverty, famine, and disease whilst the old man tries, in vain, to convert the heathen natives to Christianity.  This somewhat predictable story is surprisingly engrossing, perhaps due to the author's compassionate feelings towards the hapless-yet-happy natives.  Although Kingsolver overdoes the pathos a bit especially in the end, I thought this first two-thirds of The Poisonwood Bible was very enjoyable.<br />The remaining third of The Poisonwood Bible is basically the post-Belgian Congo experience narrative, again told by family members sans papa.  The author crams in 30+ years of modern sub-Saharan political history into 170 pages.  And this history lesson is extremely skewed by anti-American sentiment (..although undoubtedly some of this is justified).  While initially quite interesting, the final 100 pages is very slow reading - as if the author simply didn't know how to end the book.<br />Bottom line: a uneven account of one American family coping with the wilds of the Congo.  Worth reading for the 'first novel', with the final 170 pages being best left unread.	2001-10-29

Most folks reading this review has either seen the film or at least has a good idea on what it is about.  So is it worth bothering chasing down the novel (actually, a novella) now that it is out of print (in the USA)?  The answer is yes, most definitely.<br />For those who aren't familiar with the story, it is a gothic fable about a fictitious New England town where all the married women are, or quickly turn into the sort of wife many men would dream of: buxom, cheerful, and submissive in every way.  But this utopia/hell is challenged by the arrival of a new family where the Mrs. seems to sense something is wrong ... and feels, with justification, she is in danger.<br />The film does follow the book rather nicely, although the ending is a bit different.  Fans of the movie will not be disappointed however.<br />Bottom line: a short, nightmarish fable of 1970s Americana.  No, it is not very believable.  But it is well-written and thought-provoking.  Recommended.	2001-10-23

High Five is my first Janet Evanovich novel and, accordingly, my first to star the whacky-yet-lovable Stephanie Plum. Stephanie is a bounty hunter who gets into all sorts of trouble. Perhaps part of the reason is that she is a total babe, and men simply drool when she is near. The story, while not entirely believable, is plausible enough to sustain interest. Kudos to Janet Evanovich for writing such an enjoyable piece of fiction. <br />My only complaint with High Five is its cover. The hardback version here in the UK is some turquoise nonsense with a picture of some Stephanie Plum-like model. Most prospective male readers will probably then think its contents equates to nothing more than mindless 'chick lit', which is a shame really. Guys, this is really a good read where both guys and women are equally abused in a very humorous, readable fashion.<br />Bottom line: I cannot recommend High Five enough. It makes for wonderfully entertaining (albeit light) reading.<br />(PS - even though High Five is the fifth book in the series I think it is perfectly fine to start off with it. It worked for me.)	2001-10-22

It is a shame Patricia Highsmith was unable to sustain her brilliance throughout all of her novels.  Even the Ripley series has its slow moments.  I had hoped the final Ripley novel from Highsmith would be one of her better works; some of the amazon.com reviews looked promising.  But sorry to say, Ripley Under Water is just average Ripley fare.<br />Ripley Under Water starts off with such a wonderful premise.  Tom Ripley is being hounded by a fanatic who for some inexplicable reason senses Ripley's murderous past, and is determined to make Ripley's life miserable as he uncovers the truth.  But unfortunately Highsmith doesn't turn on the anxiety as expected, and the story has a rather unsatisfactorily flat ending.  Beyond this, Highsmith spends so much time re-telling tidbits of the early Ripley novels ... as if there are potential readers who decided to start off on this book rather than follow in sequence (not likely, and not advisable).<br />But Ripley Under Water works very well in one aspect: the Ripley ambiance.  It is amazing how Highsmith can capture the feeling of the characters and the setting so consistently throughout the Ripley series, a series spanning some 30+ years.  She spends so much time detailing Tom Ripley's behaviour at being ... Tom Ripley!  Enjoyable to an extent, but this too wears thin.<br />Bottom line: a satisfactory read for Highsmith fans only.	2001-10-17

Dick (PKD) is known for writing very clever, often times too clever, science fiction novels.  I find his work to be engaging even when he really goes off wild tangents, mostly because I'm in awe of his creative mind.  He also is very good storyteller.<br />Dr. Bloodmoney is non-standard PKD material in that it is extremely readable and, surprise!, understandable.  It is a rather curious story of survival in the bizarre, mutant-rich world of post-WWW III (nuclear war) San Francisco bay area.  Yes, there are weird creatures and a fair amount of metaphysical shenanigans (..PKD trademarks).  But PKD is remarkably controlled in telling this story, and it scores well on the believability index.<br />Bottom line: Philip K. Dick goodness in controlled, measured doses.  Certainly not his most creative work, but perhaps his most accessible.  Recommended.	2001-10-10

Cornell Woolrich novels are perfect for those who want to discover the world of 'noir' crime novels of the mid-20th century.  While most of these novels are long out-of-print, some of Woolrich's classics are still available.  'Waltz Into Darkness' is one of these classics.<br />'Waltz Into Darkness' is the story of a middle-aged bachelor who marries someone who he knows only through love letters.  He winds up getting more than he bargained for.  His wife, clear to all except himself, is no angel.  Due to her cold-heartness and his warm-heartedness, he decends down to her level.  While one can think of this as being a trite story, one which has been filmed under different titles, the story worked for me as a pure character study rather than a crime novel (..yes, crimes are commited).  The ending is most painfully moving.  The psychological elements of 'Waltz Into Darkness' reminds me of the wonderful novels by Patricia ('Talented Mr. Ripley') Highsmith.<br />My only complaint about this novel is Woolrich's tendency to concentrate on writing a great story and not &quot;sweating the details&quot; on descriptive details.  This story is supposed to take place in New Orleans circa 1880.  But Woolrich doesn't bother to make the reader feel he/she has been transported to such a time/place.  Having recently read Kate Chopin's The Awakening, the setting being New Orleans circa 1900, I can plainly see how the superb 'Waltz Into Darkness' could have been better.  Having said this, 'Waltz Into Darkness' has a richer literary feel than some of Woolrich's earlier works.<br />Bottom Line: terrific psychological crime novel.  A great book for Woolrich fans and neophytes alike.	2001-10-09

Until I discovered that a friend was a closet Wheatley fanatic (&quot;he's the best writer EVER!&quot;) I never had considered bothering with Wheatley's occult (&quot;the devil made me do it!&quot;) nonsense.  But when I found a used copy of The Satanist for twenty pence I figured what the heck.  And I glad to say I got my money's worth, sort of.<br />The Satanist is a very complicated story of devil worshipping, mental telepathy, and cold war paranoia.  No, none of it is believable for a moment.  And Dennis Wheatley is a poor writer in that there is too much silly dialogue, no character development, and weak prose.  It often reads like a script of a B movie.  But like a wickedly enjoyable B movie the story is shamelessly enjoyable, and Dennis Wheatley seems thoroughly knowledgeable of the occult.  So in the end I enjoyed The Satanist.<br />Bottom line: devilish nonsense, much like reading the script of a cheesy horror movie.  But Wheatley's story telling and obvious enthusiasm in the subject matter makes for fun reading.<br />PS - as other reviewers as noted, The Satanist contains some of the most cruel and completely irrelevent racial slurs I've ever read.  Fortunately these comments are not too frequent, but they are certainly hard on the eyes.  Such nonsense is outrageous nowadays, and politically incorrect even when The Satanist was written (1960).  Bad form, Wheatley.	2001-10-04

Its premise (two physically identical strangers met and change roles) is in no way believable.  And Du Maurier's writing style can be described as elegent yet a bit dull.  However for some inexplicable reason The Scapegoat is a memorable read; I found myself completely taken in by the story despite its silly premise.<br />To understand why, I think the answer lies beneath the surface of the story.  After the two physically identical men switch roles, Du Maurier focuses attention on the lonely, nice professor who is suddenly forced into the role of a French landowner, businessman and ... cruel monster.  It's fascinating how he pulls off not only the role reversal but digs into the twisted hearts of the people (spouse, family and friend) around him.  I found the emotional, humane side of the story to be most compelling.<br />Bottom line: a ridiculous story made fascinating and memorable by the ever talented Ms. Du Maurier.  However I fear the author's style in slowly building the story might turn people away before they reach page 50.	2001-09-27

Night Has A Thousand Eyes is my first Cornell Woolrich novel, and it surely won't be my last.  It is a fascinating story of a rich father and daughter caught up into the rather incredible true predictions of a reluctant storyteller.  When the predictions take a grisly turn the police are called in and ... the story really takes off (no spoilers here).  Oh, and the ending is rather satisfying as well.<br />However the novel isn't perfect.  The characterizations and the prose both lack depth.  Clearly Cornell Woolrich is better storyteller than a novelist; I should think his short stories would be better than his novels.  Regardless, it is most unfortunate that most of his works are out of print.<br />Bottom line: a fascinating, unique story.  Not exactly fine literature, but a real 'page turner' nonetheless.<br />(Night Has A Thousand Eyes, presently out-of-print, shouldn't be hard to find on the used book market.  I found an early 1980s US edition here in London.)	2001-09-22

I'm married! I have kids! Now how did THAT happen?!?!&quot;-type of trauma many women probably feel from time to time. By today's standard the story isn't terribly original, and the subject matter has been better addressed in more current novels. But The Awakening was the first.<br />While Kate Chopin handles the subject matter with sensitivity, her writing style is a bit ... prosaic. I can understand why other reviewers feel The Awakening is only useful as a sedative, which is unfortunate. Sticking with this (brief) novel through its mid-point is rewarding; the last half, while still slow paced, is quite interesting as our poor housewife tries to come to terms with her mid-life crisis. And The Awakening has a most surprising and moving conclusion.<br />So The Awakening has aged rather well these past 100 years. And even a guy (like me) can appreciate the somewhat feminist subject matter. Worth a look.	2001-09-22

Its leading character is a very thinly disguised Armistead Maupin, who really portrays himself as a very insecure individual. He suffers from writer's block, a failed relationship with his partner, a troubled relationship with his father, etc. He cries a lot, but his soft center turns rock solid when confronted with anyone who is anything but 100% gay accepting (..forget about pity for those in the closet). I really don't know why Maupin chose to write about such a character. Maupin's best work, Maybe the Moon, succeeds due to the wonderfully unique characters he derived from his imaginiation.<br />Our Maupin-like character's life is further complicated when he develops a relationship, via phone, with a sexually-abused thirteen year old AIDS sufferer. Bizarrely, the relationship turns rapidly to a father-son 'thing'. At this juncture the book was becoming a complete tearjerker, despite Maupin's fine flair for prose and copious amounts of funny witticisms.<br />However the last half of the book is as good as the first half is, well, not so good. Interesting questions are raised about the thirteen year old boy that I found to be compelling and completely unexpected. Sorry, no spoilers here. But rest assured that the reader is rewarded in the end after plodding through the beginning.<br />	2001-09-19

For those who are not aware, the Flashman series is about a mythical 19th century British soldier who, despite being a coward and a cad, finds himself on the winning end of some of the most historical battles/situations. The books succeed by being both well-researhed historical fiction and, well, comic novels. So how does Flashman's Lady hold up?<br />Not so well I'm afraid. Flashman's Lady is really three separate novels. The first third is, inexplicably, a historical piece on cricket in the 1840s. The subject is completely out of context with the remaining two-thirds of the novel and, well, I found it to be only marginally interesting.<br />The second third of the novel picks up nicely with a pirate adventure in Indonesia. Flashman's ditsy wife is kidnapped and, reluctantly, Harry Flashman runs to the rescue. Unfortunately the author doesn't do enough with this promising story. Flashman rescues his wife and soon finds himself back on the high seas.<br />On to the last section of the novel, and Harry Flashman and his wife are captive in Madagascar. Madagascar in the early 19th century was rule by a tyrant queen that defies believe (..in terms of the atrocities she inflicts on her subjects). Naturally she can't help to fall in love (or at least 'in lust') with Harry. Silly, yet the Madagascar setting is most intriguing.<br />Bottom line: three disjointed stories. Fortunately the last story is the most interesting. Too bad George MacDonald Fraser didn't choose to devote more on the latter two stories. So overall I consider Flashman's Lady something only a loyal Flashman fan would want to read.	2001-09-17

So I was expected a non-stop barrage of comic (and absurd) scenes.  Or rather, pure comedy thinly wrapped into what can loosely be called a novel.  I was not disappointed.<br />The story, such as it is, concerns the travails of backwater yokels living in an obscure corner of northern England.  The patriarch of a large estate is nearing death, and must decide on what to do about his will.  His only surviving relative is a bastard grandson with unknown parentage.  So he his will mandates his grandson needs to discover who his father is before inheriting money.<br />Ah, but there are complications.  His grandson is a backward, bizarre young man who marries an extremely naive young woman from Surrey.  Her mother has eyes on marrying the old patriach to get her hands on the loot.  And so on.  The story then spins into endless comic, sometimes very darkly comic, scenes.<br />My only complaint with The Throwback is, I suppose, its overall theme.  In Wilt the leading character was a hapless middle-aged man who somehow gets into a world of (humorous) trouble.  Much of the humour was also satiric.  But in The Throwback it is the innocent people associated with the patriarch's grandson (and wife) who are cruelly victimised.  Yes, it is very funny.  But I couldn't help but feeling guilty about it all.<br />Bottom line: black, slapstick comedy in superior form.  Not quite as enjoyable as Wilt, but Tom Sharpe certainly knows how to entertain his readers.	2001-09-14

A young British man reflects upon his childhood in 1920s Shanghai. During his childhood his parents mysteriously disappeared. So as fate would have it, he uses his professional skills (he is a private investigator) to unravel the mystery by returning to Shanghai right before WW II. The mystery is unraveled in the end (..and it is a surprise).<br />But where the story fails, and fails miserably, is the failure to engage the reader. The narrative is told without any emotion; at times it is like reading a newspaper. In the end I lost all sense of compassion despite the rather surprising end to the mystery.<br />Beyond the main story there are some interesting aspects to this novel. Ishiguro expertly captures the feel on 1930s Shanghai, especially for those (wealthy) foreigners living there. And some of the minor characters are rather memorable.<br />Bottom line: a disappointment overall, but probably merits a look by Ishiguro fans and/or those interested in 1930s China.	2001-09-13

Everything seems to go wrong, but eventually through ingenuity and luck (and the &quot;carnival spirit&quot;) all turns out well in the end. Wouk observes the island lifestyle, warts and all, with great accuracy. A very enjoyable read: comedy and pathos are well-blended.<br />However the book has its quirks. Firstly, it is rather dated. You can tell when he refers to JFK airport as Idlewild airport. Also, Herman Wouk takes great effort to tell the reader that the leading character is Jewish ... and is seemingly paranoid about it. While perhaps this is somewhat characteristic of Jewish Americans back then, I suspect this is more of a personal trait of the author being expressed into this character (..Herman Wouk is a noted author on Judaism and Zionism). I found it to be a bit over the top, but not really bothersome.<br />Bottom line: a well-observed comic novel. And as always, Herman Wouk writes the most readable prose.	2001-09-12

Having read most of Highsmith's novels I've become rather critical of her work in both good and bad ways.  While undoubtedly gifted in generating suspense out of thin air, many of her stories are formulaic ... with the sense Highsmith is &quot;manufacturing&quot; the novel rather than it be a result of inspiration.  However when Patricia Highsmith has a truly new and creative thought she produces great stuff (The Talented Mr Ripley, This Sweet Sickness, Strangers on a Train).  How does Suspension of Mercy hold up??  Rather well, actually.<br />Suspension of Mercy is a story about a crime novelist and screenwriter who imagines what it would be like to kill his wife ... nothing more than a morbid 'hobby'.  However when his wife walks out and keeps her whereabouts unknown people begin to talk, the police get involved, and ... it gets interesting.  Highsmith does a wonderful job on focusing on the nervous, neurotic behaviour of the characters.  While the story isn't entirely believable I found the ending to be rather good.<br />Bottom line: a very competent effort by Highsmith.  Not among her very best, but certainly a polished piece of mystery writing.	2001-09-04

Divorcing Jack is my first novel by Colin Batemen, and I thought it might be a good example of modern British/Irish fiction. Fortunately my expectations were met.<br />The story is a rather slap-stick adventure of a Belfast columnist who finds himself inexplicably falling from an unexpected marital indescretion, to murder, and on to political scandal and terrorism. No, it's not realistic. But the biting satiric humour and colourful local language makes this a delightful read.<br />Bottom line: murder and mayhem with a comic twist. Colin Bateman captures the mood of modern Belfast without taking matters too seriously (or rather, not serious at all). Fans of other popular British/Irish writers (Hornby, Doyle, Welsh, et al) will find much to enjoy with Divorcing Jack.	2001-09-02

An Ice-Cream War is a historical novel concerning the war front in the African colonies of Germany and Britain during WW I. As with most folks I suppose, I know relatively little of WW I ... and nothing of the battles fought in these colonies. William Boyd educates the reader of this forgotten slice of history very nicely by enveloping it in a very realistic story concerning reluctant soldiers, both German and British, and their families. The author strikes a successful balance of wry humour and pathos, with the end result being that indeed war, or at least this war, is horribly tragic and senseless.<br />This is the second William Boyd novel I've read, the first being Brazzaville Beach. Although both novels involve Africa, they are quite different (Brazzaville Beach is a story about modern sub-Sahara Africa). Sadly for me, I had lofty expectations of An Ice-Cream War since I thought Brazzaville Beach was one of the best novels I've ever read. So I was in a sense disappointed with An Ice-Cream War even though it is a perfectly competent and interesting story.<br />Bottom line: historical fiction on par with the best works from Michener and Uris. However it doesn't quite reach the levels of literary excellence of Boyd's Brazzaville Beach.	2001-09-01

I am about to write a rather unpleasent review of a book which has received over 1000 (mostly) positive amazon.com reviews to date. Could these people be wrong and I'm right??? Read on. Based on all the glowing reviews I purchased 'I Know This Much Is True' with great anticipation. And for the first 300 pages the book was terrific. It was a serious, humane look at the relationship between a mentally-disturbed young man and his frazzled twin brother. But then the author unwisely expands the scope of the story to include all the incredible (read: unbelievable) travails of the healthy twin brother. So the reader is subjected to innumerable little plot twists which include: homosexuality, child abuse, racial discrimination, etc. By page 500 the main theme of the story has been so diluted with this other nonsense that I was really getting frustrated. Beyond this, the author uses cheap tricks to ensure the reader is emotionally in tune with this soap opera. Every male character seems to break down into tears after every few pages (..the women shed copious tears as well). Now I am not some SUPER MACHO guy; I love such weepies as The Mill on the Floss, Jane Eyre, and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. These books extracted emotion from the reader without having to endure 'close-ups' of wimpy, blubbering adult male characters. 'I Know This Much Is True' is WAY over the top in this respect. But Wally Lamb is a good writer. The book's structure and its prose are wonderful. I would certainly consider reading other material by him. Bottom line: a great book that goes bad long before the end. Yet Wally Lamb is a good writer. Even after its credibility is completely lost one still feels compelled to read all 900 pages; the prose hums along very well.	2001-08-28

Everything She Ever Wanted is the true story of a southern 'belle' who makes the gradual transition from being a spoiled, selfish child into a manipulative, overbearing witch.  Her ego and cold disregard for the people who love her leads her down the path of murder.  From a 10,000 ft perspective Everything She Ever Wanted sounds a bit formulaic.  However what makes this book compulsive reading is the fascinating interrelationship between the murderess and her manipulated family.  I was amazed at how much she got away with, and how her family defended her until the end (despite being victims themselves).  Familial love is indeed blind.<br />Bottom line: Everything She Ever Wanted is typical Ann Rule stuff.  That is, it is well-written and researched.  No, it's not among her best works.  But it makes for pure reading enjoyment nonetheless.	2001-08-17

Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami is one of a long list of books on disillusioned youths looking for some purpose in their rather directionless lives. I wish I can say this book is a Japanese equivalent to A Catcher in the Rye. The author tries, tries very hard. But in the end I was disappointed.<br />The story is set in the late 1960s Tokyo. It tells the story of a lonesome, &quot;can't quite fit in&quot; young male college student and his relationship with friends and lovers, most of whom are equally disillusioned with life. His female companions are especially depressed, achingly so. ... and that's it! I wish I can say the story yields something particularly insightly or moves in a forward direction. Maybe it does for some. I found it to be a constant recycling of depressing conversation and, embarassingly, discussions of sexual relations to extruciating detail.<br />Having said all this, I am still a fan of Murakami. His The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a masterpiece. I only wish Norwegian Wood was as daring and original.<br />Bottom line: a heartfelt but ultimately tame and derivative look at the sadness and loneliness of youth.	2001-08-13

I was hesitent in tackling 'A Clockwork Orange' because I knew it contained many invented expressions by the author and, I feared, it would make for difficult reading.  Thankfully my fears were unjustified.<br />Firstly, as most everyone knows 'A Clockwork Orange' is a futuristic story about a sadistic teenager causing havoc with his equally disturbing mates.  His behaviour is vile, with this futuristic society being portrayed as an ultra-violent hell.  Fortunately he is caught, imprisoned, then undergoes 'treatment' to cure him of his violent obsessions.  The story flows well, with both the characterizations and the description of this future world being very believable.<br />However it is Burgess's creative use of inventive gang-land slang which makes this book most memorable.  Of course initially it is all rather confusing, but after a bit it is rather easy to follow.  One is simply left over-awed at the author's ability to get away with such creativity - I imagine his publishers (back in the early 1960s) were rather disturbed at Burgess's creation.<br />Bottom line: violent, shocking and unforgettable.  While not for the squeamish, most everyone will be impressed with 'A Clockwork Orange' - regardless if they've seen the film.	2001-08-07

Like most of the reviewers, I read 'White Teeth' because I wanted to know whether its author was deserving of all the critical acclaim or whether it was just hype.  Glad to say, Zadie Smith should be proud of her first novel; its merits greatly overshadow its flaws.<br />As for the story, 'White Teeth' is a rather elaborate tale of two interracial couples and their children in north London from the mid-1970s until the present.  All the characters are a bit odd, each one suffering one form of neurosis or another in coping with life in a racially mixed environment.  It is these characters which are memorable, not the plot (which is actually a collection of rather whimsical and unbelievable travails these characters get into). <br />Where Zadie Smith fails most is her inability to contain her enthusiasm for writing.  'White Teeth' is a joy to read, for the first four hundred pages.  However it then seems Ms Smith doesn't know how to tie all the subplots into a satisfactory conclusion. And the author has a tendency to view interracial issues through rose-coloured glasses (..not sure if this was her intention all along). Yet all of this is forgivable since 'White Teeth' does contain wonderful prose, insightful looks into the London melting pot, and memorable characters.<br />Bottom line: a very good read.  Short on realism, long on enjoyment.	2001-08-06

Matt Beaumont's first novel is a glorious wicked look at an advertising company run by half-wits, infantile managers, sex-crazed secretaries, and all the sort of neurotic people that I thought could only exist at where I work. :-)  It's all rather silly (fortunately the author doesn't take matters too seriously).  But like Bridget Jones's Diary, this is a story told through little snippets (e-mail messages).  And while this format is initially grating, it soon becomes familiar and rather engaging.<br />Don't expect any serious prose or intense characterizations here.  This book is made for easy reading.  And it is hilarious.  While the humour is a bit on the 'Men Behaving Badly' side and rather British-centric, I think most anyone who works in an e-mail driven company will find much to enjoy with this novel.<br />Bottom line: wonderfully silly.  But the author hits home with great humour and biting satire.  Perfect for those who take corporate life too seriously.	2001-07-30

'Alias Grace' has long been recommended to me but I only just read it because the story, a piece of historical fiction of a 1840s Canadian murderess, didn't sound particularly appealing.  Well my only regret is not having read the book sooner. <br />The story itself, on face value, is rather ordinary.  Teenage girl and apparent boyfriend both kill their employers.  However the girl ('Grace') is enigmatic and, as such, her actual guilt is brought into question.  All this is explained very early in the novel.  But then Atwood does a wonderful job of going into the mind and soul of our poor Grace; we are intrigued, disgusted, and feel compassion for this strange creature.  The author then deftly reveals, in minute stages, what the real Grace is all about.  The results are unexpected.<br />Oh, and Ms Atwood is a brilliant writer.  Her prose is superb, to the point where you wonder if she can write a bad sentence.<br />Bottom line: among Atwood's best.  A must read.	2001-07-30

Patrick McGrath is known for writing dark, tightly-woven gothic novels which are either good (Asylum, Spider) or unforgettable (Dr Haggard's Disease).  With Martha Peake the author has deviated from his successful formula and tries for something more ambitious.  Did he succeed?  Well...<br />Martha Peake is an epic novel about a young English woman who escapes the clutches of her drunken father and escapes to America ... just when the American revolution was about to start.  The novel reads more like historical fiction than a gothic novel.  While there are dark, sinister elements to the story I was never really frightened or caught off-guard.  Perhaps it is because McGrath spends so much time telling us about the proud and fearless freedom fighters that the gothic elements of the story are swept aside.<br />Oh, there are positive elements to Martha Peake.  Firstly, the characterization of our heroine is really well done.  And of course Patrick McGrath can churn out English prose better than most anyone else.  So Martha Peake is not an unpleasent read, just vaguely disappointing - especially for those who know McGrath has done much better.<br />Bottom line: opportunity missed, although McGrath fans will probably want to add it to their collection.	2001-07-23

'Now Wait for Last Year' is a formulaic Philip K. Dick novel involving time-travel, space travel, altered realities and unusual shenanigans all wrapped into a story which takes a slap at today's society.  As with most Dick novels, this novel doesn't quite hang together.  But it sure is a fun ride.<br />As for the story itself, it takes place on Earth in the mid-21st century.  Humans have joined forces with a alien species to fight another alien species.  A deadly drug was developed as a means of chemical warfare.  This drug is instantly addictive and ultimately fatal.  It transports its victims into a time-altered reality, a journey into either the past or the future.  But is this journey only in the mind??  Hmmm, ... read the book to find out.  But be forewarned the story gets quite complex.  Just think of the movie 'Back to the Future'; it's 100 times more complex.<br />Bottom line: classic Philip K. Dick.  However folks new to Philip K. Dick might want to start on one of his more straightforward (and more popular) works such as 'Ubik' or 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'.	2001-07-23

'The Alchemist' is a short novel (&lt; 200 pages) which tells the simple story of a young Spanish shepard on his journey to realizing his ambition in life (..finding treasure in Egyptian pyramids).  I must emphasize the word 'simple', to the point of being simplistic and trite.  It almost seems as if the author is targetting this novel to pre-teens when he continually hammers in the same message of 'follow your heart', et al.  After reading, in effect, the same message for the 10,000th time one does get a bit tired.  However there is an innocence and sweetness permeated through each page which makes the entire reading experience to be most disarming ... but, for this humbug, not quite enlightening.<br />Bottom line: enlightening for some, utterly simplistic for others.  This reader found it all to be rather charming.	2001-07-16

In less than 200 pages it transports the reader to 1950s France and tells of a complex love triangle between two men, one Italian and one American, and an American woman (who is 'off stage' most of the time touring Spain).  What elevates Giovanni's Room beyond the realm of a soap opera or trite gay fiction are its brilliant prose (Mr Baldwin seemingly cannot write a bad sentence), terrific characterizations (especially of the troubled Giovanni and his pathetic 'friends'), and its ability to capture the atmosphere of Americans living in 1950s Paris (..it reminds me of Patricia Highsmith's latter 'Ripley' mystery novels).  The book is sad and uncompromisingly honest.<br />Bottom line: WAY beyond sterotypical gay fiction.  Giovanni's Room is by any standard fine literature.  Compulsory.	2001-07-16

In 'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle' our hapless, bland former Japanese white color worker (or 'salaryman' in Japanese) finds himself entering his own wonderland, which happens to be right in his own neighborhood.  No, he doesn't say \\"curiouser and curiouser\\".  But this reader certainly did ... and smiling all the while.<br />Haruki Murakami has created a truly bizarre, original and thoroughly enjoyable story involving metaphysics, the paranormal ... and just plain \\"wow!\\".  He touches many areas (war, politics, meaning of life) in an elaborately interwoven plot - it would be impossible to explain it all in a book review.  However this book vaguely reminds me of the many Philip K. Dick novels where the author suggests that people can share the same mind space (dreams, thoughts, soul).  However 'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle' is not a science fiction novel per se.<br />While I thoroughly enjoyed this novel it does have some flaws.  Murakami failed to produce closure, or at least satisfactory closure, on several of the many subplots (and associated characters).  The book seems to end with many unanswered questions.  Murakami-san should have been slightly less ambitious  on the scope of this novel and perhaps focused a little more attention on cleanly wrapping it up (as much as this reader didn't want it to end!).  However all this is not a real bother; I'm still busily recommending this novel because of its shear audacious originality.<br />Bottom line: a unique piece of brilliance which should catapult Haruki Murakami on to the 'must read' lists of fans who appreciate unconventional fiction.	2001-07-13

Firstly, its setting (14th century Italy, life among monks) is not one associated with popular novels.  It is also a finely crafted 'whodunnit' while also educating the reader, often to fine detail, on the lives and times of a turbulent era where religion and politics were closely associated with fear and death.  I suppose the most impressive aspect of 'The Name of the Rose' is how it captures the feeling, fear, tastes and smells of its medieval characters and their creepy surroundings.<br />But all is not well.  Umberto Eco is obviously a brilliant man, an expert in his field (medieval studies, not literature).  He often tries too hard to explain the theological upheavals of 14th century Europe which, at least for this reader, was a bit too intellectual .. and distracting.  Fortunately just when you thought Eco was going way off on a tangent he re-focuses his attention on the plot.  So with patience one can easily work through the slow spots.  However for those who have a keen interest in the history of the Roman Catholic church and medieval Europe I imagine you'll not only closely read these 'boring' sections but actually study and debate them.<br />My other, albeit minor, complaint is Umberto Eco's regular use of   Latin.  Of course I can see where the use of Latin can be used for emphasis (..after all, we're talking about dialogue between monks).  But I don't understand why he doesn't give us the courtesy of providing translation, if only my means of footnotes.  It is as if Umberto Eco want so show the reader how smart he is.  Silly, because his intelligence is plainly clear anyway.<br />Bottom line: a good mystery in a creepy and unusual setting. One also gets a good history lesson on religious upheavals of 14th century Europe.  However the book would have been much more enjoyable if Mr. Eco targetted it to folks, like me, without doctorates in medieval studies.	2001-07-06

'The Brothers Karamazov' is my second foray into the world of Fyodor Dostoyevsky.  My first was 'Crime and Punishment', a book I thoroughly enjoyed.  In reading all the gushing praises by amazon.com reviewers I thought 'The Brothers Karamazov' would be every bit as good, if not better.  Wrong, very wrong.<br />'The Brothers Karamazov' is a epic novel, both in terms of scope and size (..over 900 pages long).  The reader is exposed to the turbulent lives of the (three) Karamazov brothers, their father, and friends/lovers.  The main story involves the jealousy of the Karamazov over a certain woman and a related murder, and how the Russian justice system deals with the situation.  Interesting?  Yes, generally.  There are some very dramatic and moving moments, and Dostoyevsky does an excellent job with the characterizations of the main protagonists.  Yet all is not well.<br />My main complaint with 'The Brothers Karamazov' is Dostoyevsky's constant side-tracks into very long-winded theological and philisophical discussions.  I found these to be excruciatingly dull, especially when composed as a single paragraph spanning *several pages*!!  They added little (if anything) to the story, and they seemed to serve as a forum for the author to blather away on his own personal beliefs.  No doubt Dostoyevsky was a brilliant man.  But in 'The Brothers Karamazov' he did a very poor job of integrating serious theological/philosophical issues with the story.  All this worked much better in his masterpiece 'Crime and Punishment'.<br />Bottom line: interesting story with flashes of brilliance.  However Dostoyevsky 'over-eggs the pudding' with philosophical noise which this reader found to be irritating rather than enlightening.	2001-07-05

'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold' is my first John Le Carre novel, and one of only a few Soviet-USA spy novels I've read.  I decided to give it a try because I remember as a boy (in the 1960s) that this was THE spy novel to end all spy novels.  My thoughts?  I was both overwhelmed and underwhelmed.<br />Firstly, the story is about a burned-out British spy coming home after a rough (and somewhat failed) assignment from Berlin (..right after the days of when the wall was built).  At least a third of the book is devoted to his subsequent breakdown; the reader now understands that the life of a spy is somewhat less glamourous than that of Mr. 007.  Whilst weak and vulnerable, he is approached by East German intelligence officials to see if money can persuade him to divulge information. And then ... the story takes off, with many bumps and twists.<br />I was very impressed with the overall 'cold', depressing feel of this novel.  The first half of the novel is very believable, especially our burned out 'hero/spy'.  But then Le Carre gets too clever for his own good and spins a story with too many plot twists; it is blown completely out of the realm of realty, and it makes for a confusing read.  Other reviewers have called this novel one of Le Carre's easiest to understand.  On that note I will not give him a second chance.<br />Bottom line: a moody, brooding cold war novel with an authentic feel.  Just don't let Le Carre's over-enthusiastic imagination deter you from enjoying the book.	2001-07-04

One can easily dismiss it as derivative nonsense.  Despite this lack of originality (.. Neil Gaiman even blatently &quot;borrows&quot; the idea of intelligent rats from books from Pratchett/Adams) the book makes for compulsive reading, especially for fans of London.<br />'Neverwhere' is a journey through the sewers and London Underground where an entirely alternative, and decidely creepy, reality exists.  We encounter the dregs of London life from the past several hundred years, along with some rather supernatural creatures thrown in for ... I don't why.  The story is, of course, ridiculous.  But the journey through London, both past and present, is fantastic.  Oh, and Neil Gaiman writes some very funny prose.<br />Bottom line: the perfect mild diversion for Pratchett fans, and a must read for Londoners.  The book doesn't take itself seriously; you will not confuse it with works by Dostoyevsky.	2001-06-25

Why isn't 'Brazzaville Beach' better known?<br />'Brazzaville Beach' is a story about a young British woman studying primate behaviour in Africa.  William Boyd deftly weaves the story by including flashbacks of her life before Africa (and her failed marriage in England), and by describing the present state of the war-torn African country where she resides.  When the primates (chimps) she studies start behaving unusually her life, and those of her fellow researchers, turns upside-down, and she starts questioning the behavior of herself and mankind in general.<br />In addition to being a mature, absorbing story, 'Brazzaville Beach' is written with intelligence.  The characterizations are well-drawn without be overly elaborate.  The story is thought-provoking without being too preachy.  I should think secondary schools and universities should include 'Brazzaville Beach' in their curricula as part of a social sciences program.  It is *that* good.<br />Bottom line: simply terrific.  Don't hesitate from putting it on your 'must read' list.	2001-06-19

It's about young (and likeable) juvenile deliquents who grow up under the care of a gangster (..who calls himself a private investigator).  When this gangster gets murdered these kids (now young men) need to finally do some real investigation work of their own.  The reader is taken on a bizarre, and funny, journey involving Zen buddhism and murder.  Great stuff.<br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this book is that the narrator, one of the juvenile deliquents, has Tourette's Syndrome.  This poor fellow has the uncontrollable urge to shout out (often rude and very funny) nonsense at absolutely the wrong moments.  The author actually treats him with compassion rather than ridicule; I don't think sufferers of this condition will feel exploited.<br />Bottom line: a thoroughly engaging read.  Good story, great characterizations.	2001-06-18

'English Passengers' is fun if a somewhat tongue-in-cheek account of rogues and dreamers on their way from England to Tasmania in search of, get this!, the Garden of Eden.  During the voyage the reader is given a rather humorous account of how the motley crew and passengers drive each other crazy.  Upon arrival we also see their dark side with the cruel treatment of aborigines.  The book is certainly broad in scope and lightweight on details; one will not confuse this book with anything from James Michener.  And the characterizations, while adequate, don't compare with what Margaret Atwood produced with her Booker prize winning 'Blind Assassin' (..which beat out 'English Passengers').<br />Bottom line: a book best read for enjoyment rather than an education on the English migration to Australia in the mid-1800s.	2001-06-18

It is interesting to see the wide mix of reviews for this book. 'House of Sand and Fog' seems to be viewed either as a poorly written soap opera which exploits negative stereotypes of Iranians, or it is viewed as a moving story on modern Americana and its values.  Which view is correct?  Well ...<br />For me, this book is actually well-written despite the somewhat daytime soap opera feel about it.  The main protaganists (an Iranian family and a washed-out single woman with burned-out boyfriend cop) are well-developed characters.  The author does sometimes slip into stereotypes, but the Iranian family gets the most balanced portrayal.<br />The story is about both protaganists squabbling viciously over the possession of a house (the Iranian family purchased it fairly, however it was originally taken from the single woman unfairly).  The burning desires of both parties in this matter are clearly expressed, and is very thought-provoking.  Sadly, the story takes a rather bizarre and violent twist (..no spoilers here) which is rather unbelievable and, by this reader, not appreciated.  Fortunately it doesn't ruin the overall goodness of the book.<br />Bottom line: shock/schlock ending doesn't spoil this interesting read.  Not a classic, but Oprah did good in adding this to her recommended list.	2001-06-14

I've read most of her books and short stories.  When she is good she is great.  When she is bad she is so-so.  'Those Who Walk Away' is not amongst her best works.<br />On the surface, the story is simple.  A woman commits suicide, leaving a grieving (and confused) husband and a completely distraught father.  The woman's father blames his son-in-law for the suicide and wants to take revenge (in the form of violence).  Despite this the husband has nothing but empathy for his father-in-law and continues to try to console him.  And so a chase of sort is played out (in mysterious Venice).<br />What I found unplausible about this story is the husband's continued insistence on &quot;working things out&quot; with his father-in-law despite the obvious physical danger this placed him in.  Compassion is one thing, stupidity is another.<br />Bottom line: a marginal thriller in a lovely setting.  A perfect book for those on vacation in Venice, and perhaps for dedicated Highsmith fans as well.  Otherwise I can't really recommend it.	2001-06-12

Flashman, that 19th century fictious bad boy who finds himself changing the course of history, and his fantastic adventures are certainly an acquired taste.  For me it's at best a hit-or-miss affair.  It works best when the author focuses on historical events and less so on Flashman's womanizing and toilet humor.  Thankfully, 'Flashman for Freedom!' hits the mark.  Flashman keeps his trousers on (..well, most of the time), and the reader gets to learn some things about the 19th century slave trade not normally taught in (USA) schools.<br />The story has really two parts.  In the beginning Flashman finds himself on a British slave ship bound for America after picking up its human cargo in Africa.  Without getting too gruesome, the author describes the whole slave transportation business is stark detail.  Afterwards Flashman finds himself in New Orleans and, through no desire of his own, embarks on journey up the Mississippi with a slave trying to reach (free) Canada.  I found all this rather interesting if not entirely plausible (after all, we are talking about 'larger than life' Harry Flashman).<br />Bottom line: less bawdy than other Flashman novels but more educational.  Certainly among the better Flashman books.	2001-06-11
1984571:US	50667536	R1W68CWA1T2N6K	0385315147	373503319	Smilla's Sense of Snow	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Miss Smilla: A Weird Mix of 'Geisha' and Lara Croft	This book was recommended to me by a colleague, and it sounded like a neat way to learn more about Greenland and its people.  The beginning of the book was most promising; the narrator, Miss Smilla, talking about what it is to be a Greenlander in (almost) the same rich terms found in 'Memoirs of a Geisha' (..of course this book instead captures the Japanese psyche).  But then Miss Smilla gets involved into a rather complicated thriller-type (espionage, bio-warfare) story and, well, much of the original goodness and purity of the character is wiped out.  And Miss Smilla turns out to be a heartless (but not brainless) female Rambo.  Ridiculous?  Yes, but certainly not boring.<br />Peter Hoeg is obviously a gifted writer.  The prose is of high calibre, which is especially remarkable considering it's an English translation.  But in &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot; he is definitely trying to do too much and, as a result, almost ruins what could have been a truly remarkable book.<br />Bottom line: an interesting book which offers an insight into the rather complex people of Greenland.  Just be advised that the bulk of this book turns into a Danish Tom Clancey-type thriller, and not a terribly good one at that.	2001-05-26

'No Pockets in a Shroud' is a short but interesting story of a scrappy young journalist wanting to print the truth in the world (1930s America) when politicians and big business only allowed articles which suited their interests.  Our dreamer tries valiantly to start his own magazine so he can print what he wants.  Unfortunately he forges ahead after encountering pressure from powerful (and corrupt) individuals. ... and you can imagine the outcome.<br />While competently written and brutally honest, this story doesn't quite go beyond the &quot;curious and mildly entertaining&quot; stage.  I suppose it's because I find the idealism of the central character to be a bit over the top.  No doubt McCoy, a former journalism, stuffed too much personal emotion into this book - without realising others might not share his strong compassion for uncompromised journalism *at all costs*.<br />Bottom line: an interesting read for McCoy fans, and those interested in the less than honorable side of 1930s American journalism.	2001-05-25

With 'I Should Have Stayed Home' Horace McCoy repeats his successful formula of writing a brief novel about 1930s down-and-outs, in their own language.  This time McCoy tackles Hollywood and the hopeless dreamers wishing to escape reality (ie, poverty) and become stars.  Yes, this sort of stuff has been written about before.  But unexpectedly, the main character here is a young man being abused for his looks and innocence.<br />Although entirely readable and enjoyable, 'I Should Have Stayed Home' doesn't really break new ground.  Its pathos doesn't come close to McCoy's better works (eg, 'They Shoot Horses...').  Folks new to the works of McCoy might be disappointed.<br />Bottom line: nice time capsule of the &quot;other side&quot; of 1930s Hollywood.  I just wish McCoy would have &quot;twisted the knife&quot; a little harder at the film establishment.	2001-05-24

'The Cater Street Hangman' is my first foray into the world of Anne Perry mysteries.  The book generally lived up to my expectations: a well-structured murder mystery which keeps the readers guessing to the last page.  Fans of such 'page-turner' reads will love this book.<br />The story is about a series of murders through strangulation (using a piece of wire) on an unassuming street in London.  The victims are all women positioned low on the social ladder.  One family living on the street has their lives turned upside-down with worry and suspicion.  Fortunately one member of that family, a young women named Charlotte, and a talented police inspector (Thomas Pitt) are able to work together to solve the murders.  Believable?  Not terribly.  But a fun, fast read.<br />On the negative side I find Ms. Perry's handling of Victorian era societal issues to be a bit simplistic.  Those wanting to know more about late Victorian life should read the works by George Gissing.  And those who want to read a great Victorian-era mystery should look to the works of Wilkie Collins, with his 'The Woman in White' being his best.<br />Bottom line: a murder mystery that will keep you guessing.  Lightweight, but fun.<br />(PS - I found one strange historical faux pas in this book.  Completely unrelated to the story, the author has a Charlotte's mother looking at her wedding photograph taken 30 years early.  This would mean wedding photos were taken in 1850.  Even if such a thing were possible, which I strongly doubt, it would not have been available to middle-income people.)	2001-05-24

'Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye' can easily be dismissed as a formulaic gangster novel.  The story doesn't rise much above what is found in a James Cagney film (..actually, Cagney starred in the film version of this book).  But the strength of 'Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye' is found in the wonderful characterizations.  They are nearly all cold, money hungry and devoid of any love (as a giver or recipient).  Survival by any means rules the day.  But at various points McCoy brings out a sense of sadness and loneliness in these individuals which makes for compulsive reading.<br />For what it's worth, 'Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye' is about a man to escapes from prison and continues on a life of theft and murder.  His bad life is polluted further by dealings with neurotic individuals and corrupt police officials.  Yet only when he is given a chance to break out of this mold through an encounter with the daughter of a millionaire do we understand his hidden hardships (..the reasons for his criminal behaviour).<br />Bottom line: well-written, cold but with some softness at the edges.  Fans of hard-boiled crime novels will love.  Others might find it a bit crude, and very bleak.	2001-05-16

Dick (PKD) is known for some very imaginative (ok, weird) pieces of &quot;blow your mind&quot; science fiction.  His work is often hard to understand, but almost always impressive and entertaining.  'Flow My Tears...&quot; fits this mold rather nicely, but it certainly does not stretch PKD's capabilities.<br />'Flow My Tears...' is a rather fun story about a popular TV celebrity who finds himself one day in a tacky hotel room and, to his horror, no one knows him.  There isn't even a record of his birth.  From here PKD takes on a journey of mind-altering drugs, an incestous police official and other peculiar individuals.  As with most PKD novels, the ending doesn't quite fit together.  But PKD neophytes will find this novel more palatable than his other material, mostly because it's (almost) conventional.  There is no space travel, aliens, or precognitive powers to wrestle with.  For PKD fans this is probably a good reason to not bother with 'Flow My Tears...'.<br />Bottom line: an enjoyable yet lightweight PKD effort.	2001-05-14

(Midnight Classics)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	a Depression era classic of deadbeats and down-and-outs	&quot;They Shoot Horses, Don't They&quot; is a unique piece of literature.  It's a condensed (&lt; 100 pages) novel driven by terse, uncompromising dialogue; it reads like a play or screenplay.  But it is a blistering account of low lifes who hope to win a rather seedy and cruel dance marathon.  Horace McCoy gives the reader glimpses of wasted lives and useless dreams.  It's a depressing yet rewarding reading experience.<br />The film version, starring Jane Fonda, of this novel does not accurately portray the bleakness of the setting and the desperation of the characters.  Horace McCoy gives the reader no sunshine or hope.  But such was life for millions during the Depression.<br />Bottom line: a condensed masterpiece that packs a punch.	2001-05-11

I was not expecting too much after reading the second in the series (Ripley Under Ground).  To my surprise, the book is actually a very good read.<br />In Ripley's Game our favorite psychopath, Tom Ripley, is a bit bored.  When his spy/crook buddy in Germany asks for suggestions for an assassin (for hire) Tom, most cruelly, chooses a fellow American in Paris who is terminally ill.  The reader is then taken on a wild ride where both Tom and his reluctant killer inductee are chased by Mafia hit men.<br />Ripley's Game is certainly the most violent of the first three Ripley books, and Tom Ripley has really transformed himself into a monster.  The real power of this novel is Highsmith's analysis of a dying man choosing to kill for money to help his wife (soon to be widow) and child.  It's a very strange and macabre situation, but totally plausible.<br />Bottom line: a violent and depressing Ripley novel.  Yet Highsmith's trademark deconstruction of (usually reluctant) killers is in excellent display.  Don't let Ripley Under Ground dissuade you from continuing on the Ripley series.  Ripley's Game is a very worthy read.	2001-05-10

Dick's (PKD's) novels is a difficult task.  Like his other novels during his peak period (1960s), 'The Three Stigmata of Palmer Edritch' is really more a statement on human society than a science fiction novel.  And PKD has a tendency to try to explain too much in a short amount of space.  These faults aside, this novel is classic PKD territory.  That is, it's an enjoyable and thought-provoking read if you don't try to over-analyse it.<br />For what it's worth, 'The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch' is a futuristic story where Mars is colonized by draftees from Earth.  They are bored silly, and need mind an illegal narcotic &quot;can-D&quot; to make them escape, at least briefly, back to the happy days on Earth.  All is fine until a mysterious character, Palmer Eldritch, returns from a far off galaxy with a more powerful (and sinister) drug &quot;chew-Z&quot;.  Sounds weird?  It is, but again it's very entertaining.<br />Bottom line: PKD fans will love this book.  Great fun.	2001-05-09

Margaret Atwood is clearly amongst the most talented writers of modern fiction today.  When her gift is matched with a wonderful story, as with her recent &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;, the reader is truly in for wonderful entertainment (yes, I really loved that book).  However when the story is marginal, as with &quot;The Robber Bride&quot;, one is left with a feeling that a great opportunity was wasted.<br />&quot;The Robber Bride&quot; is about three middle-aged women, each a bit unique (ie, odd) in their own way, whose lives have been changed for the worse by their evil &quot;friend&quot; Zenia.  Zenia, who is of course both beautiful and intelligent, snatches boyfriends/husbands, deals in drugs, steals money, lies, etc - she is one larger-than-life monster.  The story opens where these three women meet five years after the Zenia's funeral.  While having their regular social in walks Zenia (!).  And then Atwood gives us the full story on Zenia, the three women, ... and finally the mystery is unravelled.<br />While Atwood does entertain us with fine prose and well-developed characters, &quot;The Robber Bride&quot; is almost comical in its rather contrived story.  Worse, she resorts to throwing many male (and female) stereotypes into the stew.  Examples: all men are victims of gorgeous &quot;femme fatales&quot;, women are either weak or they are wicked, ... and Ms. Atwood throws in a perverted uncle for good measure.<br />Bottom line: entertaining in an outrageous sort of way.  Margaret Atwood has matured since completing &quot;The Robber Bride&quot;, so I suggest going after those novels first.  However this book is certainly not bad; female readers looking for a Jackie Collins-type of novel with panache will certainly enjoy &quot;The Robber Bride&quot;.	2001-05-04

Dick (PKD) books, Ubik is very hard to describe let alone categorize.  But here goes!<br />Ubik is a futuristic story of time travel, space travel, big business and a slap at American consumerism.  It's best not to be obsessed with the science fiction elements, which are a bit far-fetched, but rather to relish in PKD's brutal view consumerism and capitalism.  American readers over 40 will find the many little commercial sound-bites on 'Ubik' (..a spray with remarkable restorative properties) to be a delightful (and sinister) throw back to the cheesy TV commercials of the 1960s.<br />...but please remember that as with most PKD novels Ubik is rather hard to understand fully, and is more than a little bizarre.  But PKD's satire rings through - it's the best of several PKD novels I've read.<br />Bottom line: weird, wonderful and very original.  Don't think too much while reading it; just flow with it.	2001-05-02

In this wonderfully atmospheric story she tells us of young, single Americans living the good life on the cheap in southern Italy (circa 1955).  It all sounds so dreamy until we understand that one of these vagabonds, a Mr. Ripley, is a bit psychotic.  He uses his 'talents' (mimicry, forgery) to a deadly advantage ... without feeling any remorse.  The story is credible (..if you don't over-analyze it) and is, as with most Patricia Highsmith novels, very well-written.<br />While the novel is less fanciful than the film, its simplicity and 'purity' makes it a worthy read even for those who have seen the film.  I found the film to be very enjoyable but it does deviate significantly from the book.  Yet overall, the film does capture the essence of Ripley very nicely - Patricia Highsmith would have been pleased.<br />Bottom line: a great read by any standard.  Among the 10+ Highsmith books I've read this ranks just below 'Strangers on a Train', which is her first and (IMHO) best novel.	2001-05-01

The style is very Japanese, but its message is universal.<br />The story is about a middle-aged Japanese businessman who describes his life from childhood.  It soon becomes clear that the childhood friendships he had, and lost (or threw away), has left him feeling rather empty despite having wealth, a happy marriage and family.  When a particular childhood friend shows up suddenly his life changes dramatically, and unexpectedly.  Without wanting to give anything away, the only real demerit is the author's over-enthusiasm in making 'South of the Border, West of the Sun' into a modern day 'Casablanca'.  I found this to be gratuitous and silly.<br />Overall the story is very basic, but I couldn't help but being moved by the message of the importance of childhood relationships and how they should be savored.  The emotional punch of this novel greatly outweighs its sometimes crude narration and the relatively poor English translation. <br />Bottom line: basic, genuine and emotional.  Murakami succeeds with sincerity despite his lack of literary finesse.  I look forward to reading more from Murakami.	2001-04-30

And as in most of these cases, the results are less than if he chose to write it as non-fiction.<br />The 'story' is about a couple, keenly knowledgeable of art history, who upon meeting their wacky neighbors discover that they own a small collection or art antiquity.  One particular piece of art is suspected to be a missing piece by a famous Dutch painter (its origins and value is not understood by its owners), and our happy couple proceed to swindle, or rather attempt to swindle, their neighbors - all to a humorous effect.  The story is then, in effect, placed on hold while the author delves into great lengths about this Dutch painter, they type of paintings he did and why, etc.  We are given a lengthy art history lesson.  Enjoyable?  Yes, generally.  However the 'story' itself is rather contrived, with the author not bothering to flesh out the characters.<br />Bottom line: a curious read to be savoured by art history buffs.  All others will probably be bored with it all.	2001-04-27

It follows the formula often used by Highsmith: two men, guilty or accused of murder, playing a psychological duel until either party breaks down.  However in this novel the formula didn't work that well for me.<br />The story is about an American couple (hubby is a crook, wife is unfaithful) on vacation in Greece who 'accidently' kill a cop.  Another American, a stranger to them, helps in covering up the crime.  Of course they don't get off that easy, and the adventure begins.  The relationship amongst these Americans takes odd turns, and ... you'll need to read the rest.<br />I suppose I found the book 'only entertaining' (versus enthralling) because I felt the main characters were generally unlikable.  I had no empathy, let alone sympathy, for their plight.  However perhaps the best part of the novel is the perfect capture of early 1960s vagabond European travelling (ie, before the era of jet travel and package tours) to be fascinating.  So for this (probably unintentional) reason I found 'The Two Faces of January' to be a very fast read.<br />Bottom line: an enjoyable romp of mystery and old-fashioned European travel.  No, not a Highsmith classic.  But even her 'so-so' efforts are better than most.	2001-04-17

It starts off with a pompous master chef from England telling us about how to prepare fine French delicacies while he is enroute to France from England.  However one soon realises that it's not the recipes which are of main importance but rather the cunning little detours he takes when he slips in a few words about his life.  We soon realise this bore has a hidden mean streak.  The book matures into a dark comedy - I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />Bottom line: a fast, enjoyable read for all - especially those fans of French cuisine.  I also recommend John Lanchester's second novel, 'Mr Phillips'.	2001-04-14

The humour is crude, along the lines of what is found in the 'Men Behaving Badly' sitcom.  And while the story gets a bit repetitive, with scenes constantly switching between London and New York, Martin Amis wraps it up with a clever and unexpected ending.<br />My only complaint with this generally well-written novel is its sporadic lapse into rather offensive material as a guise for humour.  There is one scene where the main character repeatedly attempts (and fails) to rape his girlfriend.  Funny? ...er, no.<br />But overall 'Money' is a fun read.  It will probably appeal to men, more the Brits than Americans.  I can imagine most women will find it offensive.  And parents, don't let kids under 16 get near this book.	2001-04-13

I remember when Harry Kemelman's 'rabbi' series were best sellers in the 1960s/1970s.  Thirty years on, after the books are all but forgotten, I decided to try out 'Friday the Rabbi Slept Late' - the first in the series.  Was it worth the wait?<br />The story is about a rabbi in New England who is dealing with bureaucratic hassles with his congregation.  Yes, apparently even amongst the Jewish orthodox politics is a fact of life.  Just when the rabbi (Rabbi Small) seems to unable to cope a murder is committed outside his temple.  And Rabbi Small is both a (reluctant) sleuth and murder suspect. (..you can guess the rest)<br />While Harry Kemelman is a capable writer and the book makes for fun (albeit light) reading, the story has telemovie or TV crime drama feel to it.  It left me neither shaken nor stirred.<br />Bottom line: a light read, perhaps better suited to young teens.  But this book cannot hold a candle to the works of Agatha Christie or Patricia Highsmith.	2001-04-06

After having enjoyed many of these I had high expectations of 'A Game for the Living'.  Sadly, I was disappointed.<br />Unlike Highsmith's successful formula of writing tense thrillers about accused murders undergoing extreme apprehension about being caught, 'A Game for the Living' is a simple whodunnit-type murder mystery.  It involves the murder of a &quot;loose&quot; young Mexican woman, and the friendship of her two lovers as they try to locate the killer.  I found the story to be banal, with no suspense build up.  It is hard to imagine this book was written by Highsmith.<br />Bottom line: skip this book, buy one of Highsmith's (much) better works such as 'The Blunderer', 'Strangers on a Train', and 'This Sweet Sickness' (..to name a few).	2001-04-04

The Ice Storm is a well-written, economical analysis of 1970s suburban life as told through the lives of two closely linked dysfunctional families during one sad winter evening.  The story has many bitterly satiric elements, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.  The author manages to pump in all the kitsch elements of the 1970s we all tried to forget: wife-swapping, awful tastes in furniture and clothing, drugs/booze, and the Vietnam war.  A fun, fast read.  For folks over forty it will be a trip down memory lane.  For all others it will be an education.<br />Bottom line: a good read.  No one will confuse it with brilliant literature, but it is an accomplished effort.<br />(..no, I have not seen the film.  However the novel's simple structure makes me think it would transfer to film ratherly nicely.)	2001-04-02

And to an extent, the book delivered the goods.  It is a rambling story (about a dysfunctional family, and their friends, as they cope with the tragic loss of two teenage boys) with memorable characters and dramatic scenes.  And Irving's breezy writing story is, as always, very accessible - that is, it can just as easily be read in small chuncks (eg, while commuting) or in one sitting (eg, while at the beach).<br />Yet I was disappointed with this novel.  The story has many contrived elements (eg, it seems that all the characters become successful novelists without effort), and unlike some of Irving's best works ('Garp', 'Owen Meany', 'Son of a Circus') I felt A Widow for One Year had a disorganized, ill-conceived feel to it ... as if John Irving really didn't sweat the details.  John Irving has done better, much better.  I had thought of him as one of the best American authors of modern literature.  But this novel is nothing more than popular fiction.<br />Bottom line: enjoyable, but Irving 'newbies' should turn to his better works for a taste of his brilliance.	2001-04-01

While at worst enjoyable, these later works lacked the psychological tension of her first book (which was turned into a Hitchcock film).  Fortunately, I discovered the (now) little-known 'The Blunderer', Highsmith's second mystery novel (after 'Strangers on a Train' and before 'The Talented Mr Ripley').  It is equal to the best she has ever done.<br />Like 'Strangers on a Train', 'The Blunderer' is the study of two accused criminals and how they cope with each other while being hounded by an aggressive police detective.  As guilt and suspicion build with each page the reader is really dropped into the deep end of endless anxiety and self-doubt.  I found myself completely absorbed, especially during the last half of the novel.  It is such a joy to read a novel that is crisp, economical and written in a seemingly effortless style.<br />Bottom line: 'The Blunderer' is a must read.  Hopefully it will be reprinted so that Highsmith junkies (like me) can readily find it.	2001-03-22

Harry Flashman, this mythical &quot;Forrest Gump on the 19th century&quot;, by George MacDonald Fraser is the kind of character you love to hate.  He gets all the women, gets in and out of all sorts of trouble, etc - he's certainly larger than life.  The author cleverly uses Flashman as a vehicle to re-tell (not re-write) history for the masses.  In 'Flashman and the Redskins' he succeeds admirably.<br />'Flashman and the Redskins' is a actually two distinct books sewn together.  The first half has Flashman on a wagon train from New Orleans to San Francisco.  Of course impossible mishaps occur en route.  But this gives the author the excellent opportunity to capture the essence of American expansion and  Indian/Mexican/Amercian hostilities - I actually learned a lot.  The second half takes place 25 years later at Custer's last stand.  Again, a very educational exercise.  And the link between these two stories is understood at the very end.  It's unexpected and amusing.<br />'Flashman and the Redskins' fortunately has little of the toilet humour found in other Flashman books.  So instead of being grossed out by adolescent humour I was given a history lesson wrapped in an enjoyable story.  Great deal!!<br />As with the rest of the Flashman books, it is strongly advised to read the first of the Flashman series before proceeding to any of the others.	2001-03-20

In general, I have not been impressed with the works of Wilkie Collins outside his &quot;big 4&quot; novels ('The Woman in White', 'No Name', 'Armadale', and 'The Moonstone').  'Man and Wife' was written right after 'The Moonstone', the last of his really successful novels.  Sadly, this novel is unjustly overlooked by Wilkie Collins fans.  It's actually a fun read.<br />'Man and Wife' is a complicated story about a young couple, and their friends/family, caught up in the consequences of lax marriage laws during the Victorian era.  At that time folks in Scotland were considered married if they simply announced it.  No need for marriage licenses, blood tests, etc.  Wilkie Collins's gift of building the suspense works well, and the book's ending is unexpected (and terrific).<br />'Man and Wife' is every bit as good as, say, 'The Moonstone'.  However for Wilkie Collins neophytes I suggest first trying 'The Woman in White' or 'No Name' (..both are my favorites).<br />PS - I think the previous reviewer is mistaken.  This book has nothing to do with intrusive mother-in-laws.	2001-03-19

Unlike other 'true crime' books written by attorneys (prosecuting or defense) who like to show off how smart they are, Ann Rule gives a balanced, sympathetic account of the very strange life of Ted Bundy.  But more, much more than this is the relationship between the author and the subject.  They were actually good friends before Ted's murder spree.  Stranger Beside Me is as much of an account of how Ann Rule copes with this situation - that is, coming to terms with the fact that a friend and work colleague is actually a killer.  Fascinating, almost beyond belief.<br />Clearly Ann Rule profited from her relationship with Ted Bundy.  She went on to become a very successful writer.  However rather than exploiting the situation Ann's good fortune really is just a bizarre twist of fate.  No doubt she wonders if she would be where she is today if Ted Bundy never existed, or if their personal link never existed.  I think Stranger Beside Me proves that Ann Rule would have been a successful writer regardless.<br />Bottom line: a &quot;best of breed&quot; piece of true crime fiction.	2001-03-05

Wilkie Collins came to fame with 'The Woman in White', followed by a succession of 'suspense' novels which are his trademark.  'Basil' is an earlier yet surprisingly mature work, and it is not a suspense novel.  'Basil' chronicles the life of a young, foolish man who falls in love (literally) at first sight with a young woman.  He then discovers, too late, that this 'sweet young thing' is not as she first appeared.  The author captures Basil's anguish perfectly.  While some people might find the entire story to be a bit contrived, I found the emotional element of writing to greatly outweigh this 'love at first' kitsch.<br />So in conclusion, 'Basil' should have a wider appeal beyond the Wilkie Collins fan club.  Folks who love mid-Victorian writing will find much to enjoy with 'Basil'.	2001-02-27

While Born in Exile is certainly a novel, it is actually a study of the spiritual/social upheavals during 1890s Britain.  The aristocracy was losing its hold on power in the media, government and the church to the 'radicals', namely the emerging working class in democratic society.  The main character in this novel is caught in the crossroads.  On the one hand he aspires for the wealth and prestige found in the aristocracy, yet his background is humble and his spiritual beliefs are very modern (eg, he believes in evolution).  His disgust of his working-class family and friends drive him to become a country 'gentleman' at all costs ... to the extent of becoming a complete charleton, abusing people's kind graces and forfeiting his own strongly-held religious beliefs.  The end result is not entirely predictable.<br />Born in Exile is a very intense read.  It does plod along with excessive philisophical bantering.  But the second half does move along at a reasonable pace and, overall, it is a worthy read.<br />Bottom line: Gissing fans will love Born in Exile.  George Gissing newbies should first read New Grub Street, his masterpiece.	2001-02-26

That's the story in a nutshell.  For many this would be a complete turn-off, not wanting to bother about some bland man walking around London.  But the story works.  Firstly, the book is rather funny with its ironic views of day-to-day life.  Secondly, one gains a sense of sympathy/empathy with this daydreaming (..with heavy sexual references) fellow who is completely lost when, due to losing his job, he is forced to re-evaluate his life.<br />Mr Phillips doesn't break new ground.  While having a more serious undertone, the story reminds me of 'Wilt' (by Tom Sharpe) and 'The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin', two well-known British novels (with the latter being a successful 1970s TV series).  And the funny/sad male mid-life crisis element is handled better, in my opinion, in 'Garp' and 'The Water-Method Man' by John Irving.<br />Bottom line: a fine, fast read which should appeal to most guys, especially Brits.  Since the sometimes crude sexual fantasy elements are a bit excessive I expect most women might find Mr Philipps to be a bit vulgar.	2001-02-24

With People Who Knock on the Door Patricia Highsmith deviates from her proven formula of closely examining the phobias of disturbed individuals, especially those who commit crimes or are the victims of crime.  Instead Ms. Highsmith tells the story of a middle American family whose lives are turned upside-down when one of the members becomes a 'born again' Christian.  Ms. Highsmith devotes considerable effort in exposing the hypocracy of such folks, and seems to humiliating 'them' (ie, those people who 'knock on the door' and tell others how miserable they are because they are not Christians).<br />While an enjoyable read, this book actually feels like the script of some made-for-TV film.  I didn't get the sense of apprehension found in Patricia Highsmith's earlier works.  And to be fair, her  brutal views on Christian fundamentalists are a bit obvious.  Too many cheap shots are thrown; the book is anything but a balanced view.<br />So I consider People Who Knock on the Door to worthwhile only for devout Highsmith fans.  All others would be better off reading any of her earlier works (pre-1980).	2001-02-21

Washington Square has the &quot;best of both worlds&quot; amongst the works of Henry James.  It doesn't have the brilliant yet boring narrative of his longer novels but it does have sufficient characterization often lacking in his novellas. Washington Square captures the mood of 1830s New York and the lonely live of a bland young rich woman (a daughter of a widowed doctor).  She is wooed unexpectedly by an attractive young man, much to the regret of her father who thinks he is nothing more than a gold-digger.  Ultimately our leading lady must choose between her lover and her father.  Not an easy choice.  And it is this choice which changes her outlook on life.  Yes, it is a moving story.  But fortunately it does not degrade into a tear-jerker.<br />Washington Square is the basis of a rather popular 1949 film titled 'The Heiress' starring Olivia de Havilland and Montgomery Clift.  The first half of the film follows the novel to a 'T', but then the film deviates into a more melodramatic (yet enjoyable) track.  Overall the film and novel are mutually exclusive in that if you've experienced one you probably won't enjoy the other.	2001-02-20

Irvine Welsh, the 'bad boy' of modern Scottish literature, certainly doesn't hold back when writing about his favorite subject: the misfits of urban Scotland.  He chooses realistic (read filthy) language, and is completely uncompromising in showing us how the forgotten underclass live and think.  Marabou Stork Nightmares has all the Welsh goodness (or rather, badness?) in telling a story about a teenager growing up in an utterly dysfunctional household.  His life spirals downhill, falling into company of rapists and football hooligans.  The 'Marabou stork' element is an interesting side story of the teenager's early life in South Africa as it is retold later on when the (now) young adult is suffering from some serious delusions.  Complicated?  A bit, but it all comes together nicely.<br />Marabou Stork Nightmares is not my favourite Irvine Welsh book.  That belongs to 'Filth', which should serve as a better intro into the world of Mr. Welsh for those wanting the challenge.  However Marabou Stork Nightmares an enjoyable, bizarre read.	2001-02-19

In a sometimes indirect fashion, it chronicles the soul and psyche of 19th century Colombians as the 'civilized' world sweeps into their lives, turns it upside-down, then recovers.  The author achieves this by tracing generations of an extended family in a remote village, glued together by a strange mixture of heredity, emotion, and mysticism.  This is not historical fiction by any means.  However it perfectly projects a sense of ... I don't know ... spirit? soul? of the local people.  One cannot help but feel that  the author has written something unique.<br />Despite all this goodness, the book is difficult to read.  At times the author seems to be rambling aimlessly, talking about the (too) many characters with identical (or nearly identical) names.  But I sense not a single word was written without a strong purpose.  Therefore I recommend NOT reading the book alone but rather share it, discuss it with folks interested in Latin American society.  I did not do this, and I fear I simply read many portions of the book without fully appreciating what was written.	2001-02-16

Like most Americans in their 40s, I've read more Stephen King novels over the years than I care to admit.  While certainly a &quot;hit and miss&quot; author, Stephen King is at least someone with a (sometimes out-of-control) imagination.  Fortunately he puts his imagination into good use with The Green Mile.<br />The Green Mile is a story of a 1930s death row prison, as told by one of the supervisors.  Both the prisoners and the prison guards are dissected, with both parties exhibiting the best and worst sort of behaviour imaginable.  But being a Stephen King novel we, of course, expect a surreal element to the story.  This is manifested with the appearance of an inmate with &quot;special powers&quot; (sorry, no spoilers here).  However unlike many of his previous novels where he really goes off the rails, Stephen King channels his creative energy to take to book to a very moving conclusion (yes, it's almost a tear-jerker).<br />I wouldn't say The Green Mile is Stephen King's best work so far.  However it does lead me to believe that he is finally making the step from popular fiction to literature.  Job well done.	2001-02-05

I am certainly a Highsmith devotee.  'Eleven', a collection of 11 short stories, is my first taste of Patricia Highsmith in smaller doses.<br />As with most collections of short stories, 'Eleven' is a hit-and-miss affair.  The stories are at minimum competent, with a couple being quite interesting (, creepy, weird, et al).  Unfortunately unlike with her novels, these compact stories do not play to Highsmith's strengths - that is, dissecting her characters and their phobias.<br />However I do recommend 'Eleven' for those who simply don't have the time or patience to read Highsmith's novels.  It certainly makes for excellent commuting reading material.	2001-01-27

My father (deceased) never spoke much of his childhood, probably wanting to avoid telling me of the squalor.  But as Betty Smith proves, one person's &quot;slum&quot; is another person's &quot;home&quot;.  <br />A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the (hard-to-believe-it's-fiction) story of a teenage girl, Francie, being raised in rather rough conditions during the 1910s.  Her life, as viewed from 30,000 feet, is not terribly exciting.  Yet it is her mind, her curiousity, her compassion, and her soul which is so well projected by Betty Smith. I feel that Francie and her family are, well, people *I KNOW*.  A brilliant novel.<br />My only 'objection' to the novel is that it is targetted to young adults, which might limit its overall popularity (..the book has only been recently reprinted here in the UK).  I believe the strong emotive element of this novel to be a bit too ... intense for folks under, say, eighteen.  Young adults might actually find A Tree Grows in Brooklyn to be too sentimental.	2001-01-25

The Blind Assassin is such a novel.<br />The story is rather complicated.  It involves the lives of two Canadian sisters in the 1920s through 1940s, as told by the elder sister (Iris) in her twilight years (late 1990s) ... and as related by a novel, The Blind Assassin, a cult feminist novel which made the younger sister (Laura) into a martyr.  The story is told at first in a rather straightforward fashion.  However soon one realises that information is being withheld and, most enjoyably, the reader becomes a sleuth.<br />I was especially pleased with Margaret Atwood's powerful prose; she seemingly cannot write a bad sentence.  And she has improved over time.  While somewhat an 'apples and oranges' comparison, The Blind Assassin is technically a much more mature, sophisticated novel than The Handmaid's Tale (..which is also well-worth reading).<br />Bottom line: absolutely brilliant.  Aspiring authors should read this before making a career decision (..once you read The Blind Assassin you'll probably be both over-awed, and depressed at the thought of trying to match this great literary work).	2001-01-18

While just a story, The Virgin Suicides is an oh-too-believable macabre nightmare.  But like bad-tasting medicine, it's good for you.<br />As most everyone probably knows The Virgin Suicides is about the deaths of teenage sisters.  But this is only the 'headline' attraction if you will.  The story delves actually, in an indirect fashion (the story is narrated by some unnamed neighbor, often in the form of flashbacks), into the lives (not deaths) of the sisters and their parents.  The author examines how their 'unusual' behaviour had an affect on the community, and how obsessive behaviour on the part of parents, despite best intentions, had devastating consequences.  Most interestingly, we don't directly involve ourselves with the girls themselves per se.  However by the end of the book I felt as if I lost my own siblings.<br />Bottom line: a clever, depressing yet ultimately moving book.  A must read.<br />(no, I did not see the film)	2001-01-15

Sebastian Junger does an excellent job is describing the lives of New England fishermen, their families, and the entire saga played out in the North Atlantic when two ferocious storms collided.  Folks, especially fishermen and sailors, who are often at sea will really enjoy all the minute tidbits of information re: fishing and fishing vessels.  However folks who haven't been on the ocean will probably dislike The Perfect Storm because of this exhaustive information.<br />The Perfect Storm really opened my eyes with regards to the risks fisherman take just to earn some money.  I also now have a tremendous appreciation for Coast Guard rescue teams.  Of course I didn't learn much at all about the swordfishing boat (Andrea Gail) during its ill-fated voyage, but the author does what he could to surmise what might have happened considering no living person knows what actually happened.<br />My only niggly complaint of The Perfect Storm is Junger's slight tendency to delve into tabloid journalism.  Too many weepy comments are extracted from missing (presumed deceased) fishermen's wives just to tug at the heart strings of the reader.  I really thought Junger went too far when he relates the dream, as heard from one of these wives, of a lost fisherman's infant son.  The author also has a tendency of describing certain folks, especially those ill-fated fishermen, as being &quot;ruggedly handsome&quot;.  I really wonder how the author's subjective view of these people's appearance has anything to do with .. anything?<br />Quibbles aside, I enjoyed The Perfect Storm very much indeed.

Sad to say, my devotion to Wilkie Collins has not been helped by reading this book.<br />First and foremost, 'The New Magdalen' has a radically different structure from the other Collins novels I've read.  Part of the author's strengths is his use of rich language in describing scenery, characters, and motion.  Unfortunately 'The New Magdalen' actually reads like a play.  Nearly all of the 'action' takes place in a single drawing room.  But 'The New Magdalen' is not a play, and reads instead like a claustrophobic novel.<br />Beyond this, 'The New Magdalen' tells of a basic story without much in terms of surprise or punch.  This is so disappointing when comparing this novel to his wonderful 'The Woman in White'.  Instead 'The New Magdalen' is a story of a poor woman who impersonates a rich woman, gets caught, and then too much time is devoted to melodramatic exchanges about what to think and do.  No new ground is broken in terms of class prejudices, the hunger for money, etc.<br />Having said all this, there are some glimmers of the old Wilkie Collins worth savouring.  Here and there the dialogue does shine.  'The New Magdalen' could have been a good play.  But as a novel it does not rise above average.	2001-01-04

'Try' is my first Dennis Cooper book and, well, it will probably be my last as well.  I read it because I thought it would be quality 'shock' literature similar to the works of JG Ballard, Chuck Palahniuk or Irvine Welsh.  While 'Try' is chock-full of shock elements I'm afraid I couldn't understand what Dennis Cooper was trying to say.  I hoped to be rewarded after enduring pages of serious S&amp;M verbage.  But instead the book simply left me confused, and relieved (that I finished it).<br />In a nutshell, 'Try' is about a teenager (Ziggy) who is systematically abused both physically and sexually by his two dads.  He also is in love with a straight junkie, and has an uncle who perhaps should have specialized as a proctologist for young boys.  Ziggy's world is a nightmare but, inexplicably, he takes it in stride.  He goes as far as writing a newsletter for sexually abused kids.  Suffice to say, while some elements of the story are plausible I found 'Try', on the whole, to be over-the-top.<br />'Try' is an extremely graphic novel.  Even fetish-oriented gay men would probably be amazed (to the point of ecstasy) at the lurid descriptions of rough sexual acts.  This book is definitely not for the squeamish.<br />However I will credit Dennis Cooper for at least being a 'good writer' (ie, his narrative flows well), and for at least 'pushing the envelope' in the sometimes stodgy world of literature.  He seems to have the talent to produce fine work.  However he did not achieve this with 'Try'.	2000-12-28

I picked up the British edition of The Price of Salt (it's titled 'Carol' over here) purely on the strength of Patricia Highsmith's reputation; I hadn't bothered to read the back cover to see that was a (gasp!) story of lesbians.  Having purchased the book I decided to read it despite my ambivalence to the subject matter.  Well, I feel delighted to have read such a compact, moving story of human emotion.  The Price of Salt, while greatly different from her other works, is perhaps Patricia Highsmith's best achievement.  It certainly is her most personal and emotional.<br />The Price of Salt is a story of a young woman, Therese, who is captivated at first sight by Carol, an older married woman.  Not having realised any lesbian feelings before, Therese is completely stunned by this sudden rush of emotion.  Happily, both women do 'connect' and develop a relationship.  Unhappily, Carol exacts a very heavy personal price (..no spoilers here) for pursuing this lesbian relationship.  While the unhappy (ie, due to homophobia) element of The Price of Salt is perhaps somewhat unlikely to happen today (the book was written in the early 1950s), one can only feel compassion for Carol and Therese.<br />Highsmith stresses the emotional elements of the relationship, not the sexual elements.  So if filmed The Price of Salt would be rated PG.  This should make the book appealing to a wider (straight and/or male) audience.  It could serve as an excellent primer on homosexual relationships for parents/friends of gays who &quot;don't quite get it&quot;.  However young gays, especially lesbians, might find the lack of sexual references to be off-putting.  That is, it might make the book seem watered-down or unrealistic (remember the film 'Philidelphia' where we only see gay men kissing?).  But one must remember if Highsmith had chosen to make The Price of Salt a bit racier the book would not have been published.<br />Bottom line: kudos to Ms. Highsmith.  And gentlemen, give this book a chance .. ok?	2000-12-28

Sad to say, most people, even those who are fans of Victorian-era literature, have probably never heard of George Gissing.  Those who do know him think perhaps he was a 'one hit wonder' with New Grub Street.  While New Grub Street is a brilliant read, his little known In the Year of the Jubilee (IYJ) is also a gem.<br />On the surface, IYJ is a story common to Victorian-era novels.  People are obsessed with the thought of inheriting money, making sure they are viewed as 'refined' rather than 'working class', and the notion of 'family values' is taken to an extreme.  However in IYJ we finally see the emergence of the middle class, people who are in white collar jobs and who see the value in working (rather than living off of someone else's fortune).  And most shocking for a Victorian novel, the most forceful character is a young woman who actually seeks out work to keep her life interesting (and not depend on her estranged husband).<br />IYJ is well-written, thought-provoking without being preachy, and  should be held in esteem on par with the works from James, Eliot, Wharton and, indeed, other works from George Gissing.	2000-12-27

Wodehouse work I've read and, overall, I am not particularly impressed.  This collection of short stories about a rich young man, his valet (Jeeves), and his equally rich (and hapless) buddies.  Jeeves is the savior to his rich employer whenever called to rescue him (and his friends) from some silly calamity.  The stories are contrived and seem cast from the same mold, the setting is the hopelessly obscene upper-class 1920s society of New York and England (where no one works and everyone seems dependent on financial handout by some rich aunt/uncle), and one has to wonder why a clever domestic servant such as Jeeves puts up with such blithering ninnies.<br />Having said all this, there are some clever comedic moments which  are generally derived by the clever delivery of quips by Jeeves.  One can have a pleasurable time reading Carry On, Jeeves.  However it is little more than junk food for the brain, and much of this P.G. Wodehouse material has not aged well.	2000-12-21

I have read all of Wilkie Collins's major works (The Woman in White, The Moonstone, No Name, Armadale) and a couple of his minor works (Basil, The Dead Secret).  Hide and Seek was written before Wilkie Collins made a name for himself as a 'sensation novelist'.  Unfortunately whereas Basil, another early novel, showed the promise of Collins's later years, Hide and Seek does him no justice.<br />Hide and Seek is a melodramatic story of a young deaf and dumb girl of illegitimate birth (..a big no-no in Victorian society) who, through much trauma, finds herself adopted by a kind middle-aged couple (..adding to the melodrama, the adoptive mother is handicapped).  Not wanting to cause a scandal, the adoptive parents try to pass the girl as their natural daughter.  However a stranger from the girl's distant past makes a sudden appearance and ... you can guess the rest.<br />Wilkie Collins often uses rather contrived elements in his stories.  Often times they are not central to the theme, and so one can forgive the author for resorting to 'cheap tricks'.  However in Hide and Seek Wilkie Collins goes WAY overboard with not one, but two 'one in a billion' coincidences which directly affects the plot.  This ruined the book for me.<br />But otherwise Wilkie Collins does write in a pleasent, fluid style.  His stories are readable without being too weighed-down with literary excess.  He wrote literature (versus popular fiction) for the masses.  So Hike and Seek might be a pleasent diversion for Wilkie Collins fans.  For all others I strongly advise reading any one of his famous works (listed above) to see Mr. Collins at his finest.	2000-12-20

Back in junior high school (ie, MANY moons ago) I read Tom Sawyer and/or Huckleberry Finn.  However I couldn't remember which one, nor did I know one story from the other (like most Americans, I've seen more film adaptations of these stories than I care to recall).  So I decided to read these little jewels once again. And I'm so glad I did.<br />First of all, I don't believe either story is suitable for children really.  Both Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer seem too, well, immature compared to the youths of today.  And the crude racist language is certainly unfashionable nowadays.  But as an adult one can appreciate these stories as Mark Twain's trip down memory lane, looking at life on the river with rose-colored glasses.  No, the stories (..which we all know) are not realistic.  But they are fun, harmless and well-written.<br />The Wordsworth Edition is very nice little package of both stories.  And I certainly recommend reading both stories back-to-back since they flow together well.<br />So I recommed all middle-aged kids (like me) revisit Mark Twain's memorable boys.  They will bring a smile to your face.	2000-12-18

This Sweet Sickness is a short yet accomplished work by Patricia Highsmith which chronicles the life of a young man obsessed with a former (and now married) girlfriend.  He is completely delusional in thinking their relationship lives on, and his mental state degrades rapidly with rather disturbing (and violent) consequences.  As usual, Patricia Highsmith unveils the 'sickness' of her main character very slowly.  This allows the reader to really judge matters from the main character's perspective, regardless of his/her mental state.<br />The only negative aspect with This Sweet Sickness is how the police force are viewed, in general, as incompetent in solving a murder (..I won't say who is killed, nor divulge whom the killer is).  Other Highsmith novels portray the police as cold yet extremely capable.  This mistreatment of the police force almost turned me off from This Sweet Sickness completely.  However all is forgiven with the novel's ending, which is truly beyond belief (let's just say the main character's mental state is completely shattered).  It is perhaps one of the most memorable endings to any novel I have read.<br />So This Sweet Sickness is a worthy read overall.	2000-12-12

And, well, I'm not sure what to think.  Explaining the plot is also difficult because, well, any plot about a band where the pianist is a orangutan (..a librarian by profession!) and the Grim Reaper joins the Foreign Legion leads one to believe that the novel Soul Music and the term 'plot' are mutually exclusive.  No one will ever confuse this book as being an example of literature.<br />It seems that Terry Pratchett has written lots of silly jokes and satiric observations, some of which are quite funny, loosely tied into a very absurd story.  Either you'll love it or hate it.  I'm perhaps the exception where I think the likes of Terry Pratchett are best served as a humour columnist (satirist) for a newspaper, for example, rather than as a novelist.  Soul Music does drag on.  It's sort of like listening to the class clown in grade school; in small doses it's great, but after a while .. SHUT UP!!<br />Perhaps Soul Music is the best way for you to decide on whether you think Terry Pratchett is a god or a man with a misplaced talent.	2000-12-11

Dick (PKD) seems to be the type of writer who is overflowing with intriguing ideas yet, unfortunately, wraps them in rather far-fetched (read: weird) stories.  However what makes his stories worth reading is the human element; he seems to effortlessly expose curious fractures in modern society.<br />Martian Time-Slip is a story of the travails of a Martian settlement in 1994.  His explanation of how Mars was colonized is rather implausible.  On top of this an aboriginal tribe of Martian homo sapiens are a key element to his story (.. and yes, these Martians happen to speak English also).  But playing on PKD's strengths, his story is an interesting mix of how colonists compete for power and fortune, and how these new colonists, in wanting to create the image of a perfect world, shun the mentally and physically infirmed.<br />Martin Time-Slip is a worthy PKD novel, along the lines of Ubik and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? .  Keep an open mind and don't take it all too seriously.	2000-12-06

In fact the novel Anna Karenina is only partly about the title character; a majority of the book is about the travails of her relatives, especially a thinly-disguised Leo Tolstoy going under the name of Constantine Levin.<br />While Anna Karenina is indeed beautifully written, especially remarkable considering I read an English translation, and it does transport the reader back in time to another part of the world. But the book falls far short of perfection because of its rather unlikeable (!) main character (..Anna Karenina was more a victim of her selfishness and neurotic behaviour than a victim to her husband and a sexist 19th century Russia), and due to overly-deep (read: boring) Levin character who thinks that it's better to be a uneducated peasant than a rich man (..as if!).<br />While not wanting to criticize Anna Karenina too much, I have to add that I was disappointed in Tolstoy's &quot;rose-colored&quot; view of peasants. There is almost no depiction of the squalor and disease which obviously tormented the Russian working class. Dostoyevsky, in Crime and Punishment (for example), certainly handled this area much more realistically (..almost to a fault).<br />So while Anna Karenina is brilliant effort to a certain extent I cannot think of it as a masterpiece. And since it is overly long and contains too much pie-in-the-sky socio-economic commentary by the Levin character (aka Tolstoy) I really can't recommend reading it. Certainly if you are looking for a romance novel where a Garbo-esque herione will bring tears to your eyes I suggest avoiding Anna Karenina at all costs.	2000-12-05

Invisible Monsters is a funny yet gruesome story of a young fashion model who suffers severe disfigurement when half her face is blown off (by a gunshot).  Rather than being depressing or morose, Palahniuk turns the story into a bizarre &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;-type of road movie where this fashion model hooks up with folks who are seriously confused about their gender identificaiton and gender preference.  Chuck Palahniuk's caustic wit and free-flowing narrative makes Invisible Monsters to be an odd, enjoyable and unforgettable novel.<br />Invisible Monsters contains rather graphic and crude language; it is certainly not for the squeamish.  However my only complaint with it concerns the leading character.  She seems too much like Tyler Durden, the main character from Fight Club.  Her thoughts and actions seemed were anything but feminine.  Women readers might find this very off-putting.	2000-11-23

Eve's Ransom is a short (125 pages) novel concerning the efforts of a young man to, in effect, buy the affection of a mysterious young woman. Actually, he really is just trying to help &quot;a friend in need&quot;. But the young woman leads him on, accepts his money, and in the end ... well, you know how these things turn out.<BR>Yes, the story is simple. However any material from George Gissing is an interesting read, especially for those interested in the more social aspects of Victorian society. Money and greed are also common themes, and Mr. Gissing makes keen observations in these areas that are true even today.<br />Eve's Ransom is a must read for George Gissing fans. For those who have not read any of George Gissing's novels I recommend first reading New Grub Street. It is unfortunate Eve's Ransom is no longer printed. No, it's not George Gissing's best novel. But it is still a worthy read.<br />Finally for those who like the &quot;man falls in love with Ms. Wrong&quot;-type of novels, especially those set in Victorian England, I recommend reading Basil by Wilkie Collins.	2000-11-20

New Grub Street, written by the (now) relatively unknown George Gissing, is a dark story concerning struggling writers in the late 19th century.  One set of writers believe in writing for the pure intellectual fulfillment with little/no regards of monetary reward, the other believing in simply writing whatever drivel society will buy just to get oneself rich.  Compounding this is a very moving sub-story on the issue of marriage and (the lack of) divorce in late Victorian society.<br />Much of New Grub Street is very depressing, with haunting descriptions of poverty, starvation, illness .. and writer's block.  However just when I thought it would all spiral into a sad melodrama George Gissing's strength of capturing genuine emotion between the chief protaganists saves the day.  More than that, he produced a novel I will not forget (.. and I read 50-100 novels per year!).<br />New Grub Street is perfect for those who love fine Victorian-era writers such as George Eliot; that is, it is brilliantly written but not &quot;over-written&quot; (like works from Henry James).  No need to grapple with your dictionary to enjoy this gem.	2000-11-16

Dick (PDK) certainly writes some fascinating and diverse material, but there seems to be a common thread of:<br />- social commentary/satire.<br />- space travel and Martian colonization, even if there is little connection to the story.<br />The Man in the High Castle follows this pattern.  PKD examines American life after WW II should the Japanese and Germans have won the war, and the USA is shared amongst the victors.  PKD exploits the rather unflattering (and outdated) American stereotypes of the Germans, and most especially, the Japanese to paint a rather twisted picture of American life under occupation.  While PKD's views have certainly fallen from the realms of what might have been viewed politically correct when he wrote this novel (..in the early 1960s), his rascist stereotypes eventually grated upon the nerves of this (usually) tolerant reviewer.  And I didn't find PKD's more philosophical messages very clear (unlike the some of the other reviewers).  Yet true to form, in PKD's world space travel and Martian colonization (by the Germans) flourish (no, these incidentals have nothing to do with the story).<br />PDK fans should and will read The Man in the High Castle.  However I found the sci-fi elements disjointed from the main story, and PDK's cruel view of the Germans/Japanese to be way over-the-top.  PDK has done much better in Ubik and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep; I heartily recommend either of these to the PDK neophytes.	2000-11-14

The Cry of the Owl is probably no exception since it contains the requisite murders, false accusations, etc.  Judged as a crime novel The Cry of the Owl is only so-so.  That is, it's not a page-tuner.<br />However Ms. Highsmith's true genius was her ability to closely examine the psychological aspects of a criminal, victims, and related parties.  In The Cry of the Owl we see how the general public can jump to conclusions when a stranger is accused of murder.  While all is revealed at the end, Ms. Highsmith also lets the reader make his/her own judgement ... and so we might either fall into the &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; trap or maintain a balanced, impartial view.  And she does this all in an economical, easy-to-read style that is readily accessible to most everyone.<br />No, The Cry of the Owl does not rank on par with her great works such as Strangers on a Train.  But the growing numbers of Patricia Highsmith should put this novel on their 'must read' list.	2000-11-13

This second in the long (and expanding) series of Flashman books is certainly amusing, if not minor fiction.  Our lovable (?) rogue, Harry Flashman, this time does his mischief in Prussia.  Of course he chases women at every corner, escapes death by a whisker, etc, etc.  We've seen it all before in the first Flashman book, and we have ample opportunity to see it again in later Flashman books.  However I am personally reluctant to pursue this Flashman series much further (..this is my 3rd Flashman book, having read one of the Flashman books out of sequence).  While Royal Flash does not resort to toilet humour and crude sexual innuendos found in other Flashman books, this silly escapade of Harry Flashman in Prussia is a bit ... too silly.  It feels like the TV series (and film) The Wild, Wild West.  Fun, but only in small doses.<br />Those who adore Harry Flashman should, of course, read Royal Flash.  Fine literature it is not, but historical fiction with a laddish twist it is.  On that criteria it is fine.  But with so many better novels out there I really feel most people will be better off looking elsewhere.	2000-11-06

Marjorie Morningstar is an interesting, albeit somewhat dated, story about a Jewish girl dreaming about becoming actress. Along the way she meets an assortment of (mostly unsavory) people who challenge her conviction, and alter her journey on becoming a woman. The story takes place in NYC in the 1930s with much emphasis being made to Marjorie's religious background, the anti-semitism of the times, and the challenges of a young woman maintaining her virginity. At times the novel reads like a soap opera. However there are several vignettes which are quite moving, where Marjorie's beliefs collide with the changing values of American society on the whole.<br />Marjorie Morningstar is the perfect read for the older person who can recall the time when women were expected to be virgins until marriage, and respecting the beliefs of one's parents was the norm. And for those from NYC and/or who are Jewish will find this novel to be a fascinating trip down memory lane. Besides, Herman Wouk's gift for prose is a pleasure in by itself.	2000-10-27

Lady Audley's Secret was written shortly after Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, the novel which defined the era of &quot;sensation novels&quot; (..where mystery and suspense are piled on high).  After exhausting Wilkie Collins's collection of major works I hungered for something which would leave me again in page-turning heaven.  So off I went to read this first and most famous work of Mary Elizabeth Braddon.<br />Lady Audley's Secret left me disappointed overall.  Oh its story of deep secrets, cunning, and hunger for lower class individuals wanting a piece of the aristocracy pie is rather interesting; Wilkie Collins would have approved.  But unlike Wilkie Collins, Ms. Braddon doesn't have the gift of writing rich prose.  While certainly easy to read, Lady Audley's Secret feels &quot;low calorie&quot; compared to the sumptuous works of Wilkie Collins.  It left me wanting more.<br />Wilkie Collins addicts will find Lady Audley's secret to be nothing more than a mild diversion.  For those who have not experienced the likes of The Woman in White ... what are you waiting for?!?  However for those who find the works of Wilkie Collins to be overly complex and cumbersome, Lady Audley's Secret should make for a fun read on a rainy day.	2000-10-19

Edith's Diary is the personal account of a middle-aged housewife during the period of mid-1950s to mid-1970s where the woman, slowly but surely, suffers from a total psychological meltdown.  Unlike similar stories, there is little in the way of soap operatic drama (no major fights between spouses, no lurid scandals).  All the disappointments and frustrations in Edith's life affect her inwardly, with the only clear outward sign of her insanity being relected in her diary (..which is full of entries which relect how she would like life to be, not as it really is).<br />Edith's Diary is a slow moving novel, which often reads like an episode of the Donna Reed Show.  But it does pull you in, thanks to Ms. Highsmith's excellent prose.  And when the story is over you will think long and hard about Edith, wondering if you (or someone you know) is suffering from the same situation.<br />While Edith's Diary is a book which can be appreciated by either gender I suspect women who are over 40 would be most interested in the story, and can relate to American suburban life back some 30 years ago.  It's not a happy story, but for some it might be cathartic.	2000-10-18

Unlike previous reviewers, I was not terribly impressed with Clock Without Hands.  While obviously Carson McCullers wanted to make a rather emotional, dramatic statement regarding racism in a changing 1950s Georgia, I believe she &quot;over-egged the pudding&quot;.  The story itself is about a small town in Georgia where several related characters, centered on a elderly judge, struggles with the pace of change with regards to racial equality.  While the interactions and complications between the characters are interesting and, at times, quite moving, I felt the basic premise of the story was compromised by two-dimensional racial stereotypes.  I thought the young protaganist, a blue-eyed negro, was in particular very poorly developed.<br />However Clock Without Hands does not discourage me from exploring further works from Ms. McCullers.  I was particularly impressed by the amazing Reflections in a Golden Eye, which I strongly recommend over Clock Without Hands for those uninitiated with her work.	2000-10-09

Armadale is a case in point.  It doesn't have all the endless plot-twists of The Woman in White, nor does it have the 'herione is also a demon&quot; intrigue of No Name.  But it still has all of Collins's rich writing, and it does contain one very curious and incredibly evil woman: Miss Gwilt.  For those Wilkie Collins fans who enjoy really nasty, scheming people (ala Count Fosco of The Woman in White) will adore Miss Gwilt.<br />Like most of Wilkie Collins's larger novels, it is hard to summarize the story of Armadale.  It is a complex tale of confused identities, folks wanting to inherit fortunes, and gentlemen falling in love with &quot;Ms. Wrong&quot;s.  The complicated story does take a while to get rolling (..it takes some two hundred pages before we are introduced to the chief protaganist Miss Gwilt), but it does collect momentum quickly to a satisfying conclusion.<br />So Armadale is best read after first enjoying The Woman in White or No Name.  It is a worthy member to everyone's Wilkie Collins collection.	2000-10-06

It is so rare to pick up a book expecting mild entertainment yet getting so much more.  Strangers on a Train is not just a mystery novel (..made into a Hitchcock film), it is a tautly written analysis of how criminals cope (psychologically) after committing  a heinous crime (eg, murder).  People who have read Crime and Punishment, and especially those who would like to but &quot;couldn't get into it&quot;, will love this book.  Patricia Highsmith's little gem couldn't have been written any better.<br />As an example dialogue in the novel,..<br />&quot;Of course I don't think he arranged it,&quot; Bruno replied.  &quot;You don't seem to realize the calibre of the person you're talking about.&quot;<br />&quot;The only calibre ever worth considering is the gun's, Charles.&quot;<br />============<br />I agree with the previous reviewer's comments about how unfortunate it is for Strangers on a Train to be no longer in print.  Maybe with the success of the film The Talented Mr. Ripley other works of Ms. Highsmith, such as this, will be reprinted.  For those who can't wait I direct you to www.amazon.co.uk where you will find multiple editions of Strangers on a Train available.	2000-10-04

One would expect a 20-something year old in 1940s southern USA to be all prim and nice, with no knowledge of such things as deep emotional trauma and burning homosexual desires.  Well Carson McCullers defied conventional wisdom and not only was aware of such matters but deftly encapsulated it in a short, brutal novel.  Reflections in a Golden Eye is a painful examination of the wrecked lives of two couples (, and other characters, ) on a military base in the South.  There is little in the way of action or story per se, but it is her examination of characters which makes this novel such a winner.<br />This novel is not for everyone.  It is rather depressing, with everyone leading neurotic lives.  No happy endings, and one has to wonder if there is moral to the story.  But those who can tolerate looking at the world without wearing rose-colored glasses will appreciate this masterful work.<br />PS - the novel is MUCH better than the film.  And I enjoyed it better than her other famous novel The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.	2000-09-25

Although Once Hand  Clapping was written in the early 1960s it's satiric message still rings  true.  I loved it.<br />However this novel is not for everyone.  Firstly, the  book has a very British feel about it.  Much of the wording is not used in  America, and is even distinctly old-fashioned here in England.  But  otherwise One Hand Clapping is an excellent introduction to the brilliant  world of Anthony Burgess.	2000-09-19

Wilkie Collins has written some brilliant crime/mystery novels during his  career, most notably The Woman in White / No Name / The Moonstone. His  earlier works are almost unknown nowadays.  But such obscurity is  unwarrented, at least in the case of The Dead Secret.<br />The Dead Secret  tells a simple story of a mystery surrounding an untold secret of a dying  wealthy woman.  This woman's secret is  shared only with her servant.   Despite the woman's dying wish, the servant does not divulge the secret ...  with unpleasent results.  Eventually the secret is revealed and all is  understood.<br />The novel works well mostly because it is fast paced, and it  has all the richness of a Collins novel (ie, it is well-written).  No, it  isn't as clever or suspenseful as Collins's later works.  But  Wilkie  Collins fans should place The Dead Secret on their 'must read' list.	2000-09-13

The  population growth has exhausted the food supply.  The government scorns  human reproduction and rewards homosexuality. God and religion are all but  outlawed. Soon anarchy reigns and everything is turned upside-down.   Realistic?  Well, probably not.  Consider it to be a &quot;Brave New  World&quot; written by someone with a wicked sense of humour.  This is not  science fiction, but more of a statement criticizing the world today (even  though the book was written in the early 60s).<br />Much of the book really  sizzles, with biting satire on nearly every page.  However the story  eventually runs out of steam (..it deviates to a sub-story involving the  military which, while initially interesting, bored this reader).  But let  this minor fault not deter you from enjoying a witty book.<br />Bottom line: a  rare, yet slightly flawed, gem.	2000-09-08

Wilkie Collins is known primarily for two novels: 'The Woman in White' and 'The Moonstone'.  Both novels are indeed quite enjoyable.  However I found  them to be very different, and almost &quot;unbalanced&quot;.  'The Woman  in White' is a complex novel, a rollercoaster of plot-twists at a  hysterical pace. On the other hand, 'The Moonstone' is a slow-paced mystery  which moves towards a satisfying conclusion.  'No Name' fits nicely in  between.<br />'No Name' is a story about how two sisters go on different paths  on coming to terms with life after being mistreated by a cruel twist of  fate, and being the victim of inhumane Victorian-era society (and its  laws).  The elder sister carries on without mishap, while the younger  sister seeks justice at any expense ... to the extent of performing  unethical and criminal activities herself.  While seeking justice she  encounters some rather equally cunning individuals (..another woman in  particular), and the story unfolds into a battle of who can outfox whom.   And it becomes abundantly clear that the person viewed initially as the  victim is actually very cruel.<br />Finally, I have to recommend the Penguin  Classic version of this novel for one simple reason: its cover is great.   It is a painting of a young woman (&quot;Miss Dene&quot;) who has such a  sad, reflective expression on her face that one feels she is indeed the  poor, suffering (yet malicious) younger sister Magdalen.	2000-08-29

Maybe so, but the novels differ tremendously.  The  Woman in White is a page-turning thriller of frantic proportions ... to the  extent it almost feels like a slapstick comedy.  The Moonstone is a  straightforward crime story, complete with well-developed characters and  interesting dialogue, culminating in solving the mystery: who stole the  Moonstone (..a collosal diamond)?.  The story is never dull, but compared  to The Woman in White it is hopelessly conventional. <br />So I recommend The  Woman in White over The Moonstone for most people.  However if you prefer a  more leisurely, conventional (ie, less complicated) read then The Moonstone  might be more enjoyable for you.  You really can't go wrong either way.	2000-08-23

Chuck Palahniuk is in the unfortunate situation of having written a  stunning debut novel, Fight Club, with everyone expecting him to come up  with an equally good encore.  Well, Survivor: A Novel doesn't quite measure  up.  But you would be silly pass it up.<br />Survivor is in many ways similar  to Fight Club: the story is bizarre, the leading character is a man who is  just a bit psychotic, and the author boldly dismantles elements of modern  US society (..in this case, cultism and TV evangelism).  However unlike  Fight Club, Survivor is full of caustic comedic moments.  <br />Unfortunately  Survivor runs out of steam towards the end (, whereas Fight Club actually  got better in the closing pages).  While it never got boring, I sense the  author didn't quite know how to tie the story together.  A mild  disappointment in this regard.<br />Bottom line: Survivor should be mandatory  reading for those who have read Fight Club.  For those new to works of  Chuck Palahniuk, read Fight Club first.  Those who are devoutly Christian  and/or are easily offended by crude language/activities should avoid both  books at all cost!	2000-08-11

Not until  reading did I realize how utterly depressing/tragic it is.  This doesn't  mean it's bad; Tess of the d'Urbervilles (also by Hardy) is also depressing  yet it is moving, and is an excellent read.  Jude the Obscure, at least for  me, falls short of the mark.<br />Jude the Obscure is about a man who wanders  (..literally across all southern England) looking for happiness in marriage  and life.  He's a deep-thinker who is incredibly naive and, due to bad luck  and the social neurosis of the Victorian era, finds himself moving further  away from his objectives with each passing...page!  Just when you think  Jude's life is about to turn for the better it turns horribly tragic.   While similarities to Tess of the d'Urbervilles abound, Tess's tragic turn  was expected and plausible.  Jude's misfortune comes from nowhere, and so  it seems like Hardy is playing a cruel trick on the reader.<br />So I disagree  with the strongly opinionated reviewers before me.  Jude the Obscure is  neither great nor terrible.  I find it to be rather formulaic Hardy, which  for many readers will be reason enough to read over and over again.	2000-08-07

Well, she is both wrong and right.  It is most definitely a book about and  for women, but it is so light hearted and funny that even men can enjoy it  (assuming they can get over the embarassment of being seen with such a  book!).<br />Bridget Jones is a story of one year in the life on a 30-ish,  single London girl.  She is constantly in panic mode, unbelievably  obsessive about her weight, looks, and what people think of her.  No, the  story is hardly original.  But Ms. Fielding takes these female stereotypes  and blows them out of such hilarious proportions that, well, it's hard not  to laugh with (and at) Bridget's problems.  And men will find Bridget Jones  generally likeable because, fortunately, the story doesn't take its  &quot;man bashing&quot; very seriously.<br />Being a middle-aged (American)  male in London, I thought the world was looking at me when I read this  &quot;girlie&quot; book on the Underground.  But this didn't bother me in  the least; it's their loss for not reading it themselves.<br />And for those  who might think my female colleague is some sort of Bridget Jones herself,  guess again.  The previous book she loaned me was Crime and Punishment  (..fat chance Bridget would buy let alone read that!).	2000-08-01

This second installment of the Danzig Trilogy was an overall disappointment.  While Gunter Grass's flair for story-telling is all here, Cat and Mouse does not stretch into the varied themes touched by Tin Drum  (..the first book of the trilogy).  Cat and Mouse reads more like an early  John Irving novel (..with a German/Polish twist) rather than profound  literature (with all due respect to Mr. Irving, who has written some  wonderful stuff in recent years).<br />Cat and Mouse is a story growing up  (..mostly high school years) in German occupied Poland during WW II.  The  characters are quirky (..especially the boy with a protruding Adam's apple)  and amusing. But this coming-of-age tale has been told better  elsewhere.<br />Bottom line:  read Tin Drum.  Cat and Mouse will seem stale  (and hastily written) by comparison, but fans of Gunter Grass probably  won't complain much.	2000-07-31

Judging by its subject matter (World War I) I wouldn't have normally touched it let alone read it (..war novels/films are either too  depressing or a thin excuse for some flag-waving).  Well I am delighted to  have read Birdsong.  It's not a great book (in my judgement); it doesn't  cover new ground in re-telling the horrors of war.  But it is  well-structured, moving, and keeps focused on finite (and often forgotten)  aspects of the Great War - specifically, trench warfare.    Mr. Faulks  leaves out nothing in describing the unspeakable horrors our forefathers  (..from both sides) have suffered.  Absolutely shocking and nausating, yet  it's really compulsive reading.<br />While Faulks succeeds in telling the  human anguish of those who suffered during the war, he fails in one minor  aspect of the novel when he &quot;fast forwards&quot; to scenes of the late  1970s where the granddaughter of a soldier feels compelled suddenly to  learn more of her departed grandfather.  While the author's heart was in  the right place, this minor aspect of Birdsong comes off a bit  contrived.<br />Nonetheless I fully recommend Birdsong.  It makes for gruesome  reading, so it's not for the squeamish.  But I hope others will give it a  try and, like me, feel as though they learned something new by it.	2000-07-28

Fight Club is such a complex story which, surprisingly, isn't all about fighting.  It  would be useless, as other reviewers have tried to before me, to try to  explain the story.  But the story does raise questions about American life,  especially frustrations of men coping with constrained masculinity  (..constraints imposed by society).<br />The novel deviates from the film  (..actually, vica-versa).  The novel is tighter, with the stunning  revelation of the main characters towards the end of the story being  smoothly explained in the novel but comes off jarring in the film.<br />It's a  shame the film did not reflect the novel exactly since it would have made  the film more successful.  The novel has both the leading characters,  portrayed in the film by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, meeting initially on  a nude beach.  Surely such a scene would helped at the box office. :-)<br />I  believe Fight Club will become a classic, along the lines of A Clockwork  Orange.  I am looking forward to reading other works by Palahniuk.	2000-07-24

I feared that it might contain the starchy language often used in mid-19th century novels, or be some sugar-coated romantic drivel (eg, damesels in distress looking for Mr.  Darcy or Heathcliff).  I am relieved to report The Woman in White, as other  reviewers before me have reported, is actually a very tight, unpredictable  suspense novel.  It's story is a bit complex, but Collins unravels it  rather nicely. And its language is very easy to follow, without archaic  local expressions found in other novels (eg, by Hardy or Eliott) of that  time.<br />I found most of The Woman in White to be utterly delightful.  The  story is fascinating, and I found myself continually trying to read just a  few extra pages to see what happens next.  However the book eventually runs  out of steam, to the extent it only becomes fairly interesting (versus  thoroughly engaging).  Part of this is due simply to its length (600+  pages, which is long for a suspense novel).<br />Bottom line:  The Woman in  White is a fine read for most readers (&gt; 16 years of age).  And it  should appeal equally to both men and women.  I will certainly look to read  other novels by Wilkie Collins.	2000-07-20

On the surface it tells of the senseless death of two academics/scientests (..a married couple), then it proceeds backwards to explain the lives of this couple and their daughter.   But there is really nothing exceptional about any them, and so one can  easily say Being Dead is a book which describes the deaths of some boring  people.  Big deal.<br />Ah, but that would be an incorrect assessment.  Jim  Crace's story of brutal deaths of uneventful lives really brings across the  sense of how short life is, and how it can be snuffed out at a moment.  It  leaves you with a cold sense of loss, the same feeling one experiences with  the death of a loved one.<br />Being Dead is a well-written, absorbing novel.   Recommended.	2000-07-17

However unlike his other novels, the  story and characters in Disgrace are easily identifiable - and hence, it is  perhaps the most moving novel of the lot.<br />Disgrace overviews the life of  a disgraced university professor who, upon forced to leave his post, moves  in with his estranged lesbian daughter on her rural &quot;farm&quot;  (actually, a kennel out in the wilds of South Africa).  While at the farm  an incident occurs which makes the professor and his daughter re-evaluate  their lives (..sorry, I really want to avoid divulging the story).  The  story is painfully plausible, and the complex characters and their  interactions make this to be a fine read.  And the modern South African  setting only adds to the complexity and intrigue.<br />My only grumble with  Disgrace is Coetzee's usage of symbolism at various points.  I found such  symbolism to be too obvious and utterly gratuitous.  Otherwise I think most  everyone over 18 would enjoy this book.	2000-07-13

I have avoided &quot;gay literature&quot; because I felt it would either be too depressing, or it would be all sex and no meat (..sorry for the pun), or it would take another tact and be very saccharine (ie, you're gay  but we love you anyway).  A Boy's Own Story manages to avoid stereotypes  and tells, in autobiographical fashion, the simple story of a gay teenager  in 1950s America.  The boy isn't a hero, nor is he particularly  interesting.  But he does survive, albeit somewhat emotionally scarred by  the experience.<br />I was hoping the story would dig deeper and have an  inspirational message, or in some way be memorable.  But rather, it does  not challenge conventional wisdom or break new ground.  Yet I was satisfied  by the seemingly honest, well-written story.<br />I would generally recommend  this book to a wide audience (gay or straight).  It does not exploit gay  sexual antics, and it's description of teenage angst is rather universal.   However struggling gay teenagers might not be pleased with the book; it's  overall message is somewhat bleak, or at least it doesn't view gay life  through rose-colored glasses.	2000-07-11

He is the  &quot;champion&quot; of the poor, uneducated urban junkies of Edinburgh  (Scotland).  Since he writes in the first person, his books are, in effect,  stories about junkies as told by junkies.  The language is vile, the  stories are frequently disgusting and depraved.  Yet all this shock  treatment is not gratuitous; all the stories strike me as oh-too-realistic,  as if Mr. Welsh has lived in the gutter with these misfits.  After the  shock wears off, one is generally left with a feeling of compassion for  these poor addicts (there but the grace of God...).<br />The Acid House  differs somewhat from the author's other novels.  It is actually a  collection of short stories, plus a novella.  While remaining true to  general cause (ie, the plight of the junkie), some stories are rather weak  (fortunately, these stories are very short indeed).  Others are most  memorable, with very clever endings (..I refer you to Irvine Welsh's  masterpiece, Filth, for a really good ending!).<br />So The Acid House is the  perfect read for Irvine Welsh fans.  For others, be prepared for vile  language, and sometimes incomprehensible language (..Scottish dialect).   And parents, don't even THINK about letting your kids touch this or any  other Irvine Welsh book.	2000-07-10

Unlike the reviewers before me,  I found this Flashman book to be disappointing.<br />Compared to the original  Flashman novel, Flashman at the Charge has much more in the way of male  adolescent humour.  While funny at times, it does wear thin.  And the  history lesson (Charge of the Light Brigade) is relatively brief.  Too much  time is devoted to Flashman's escapade as a prisoner of war which offers  modest entertainment and an excuse for more sexual exploits.<br />Fraser has  &quot;dumbed down&quot; his Flashman character into someone like Al Bundy  from the Married with Children sitcom.  I wish Fraser would spend a bit  more time on giving us an enjoyable history lesson.<br />However I will give  the Flashman series one more try, and hopefully my opinion will reflect  those of the other, more enthusiastic reviewers.	2000-07-06

Michael K. envelopes himself into his own  personal cocoon whilst traversing the South African landscape, shielding  himself from generally unpleasent individuals and activities.<br />While this  story is superficially very promising, digging deeper I really found  details lacking (especially reasons for Michael's behaviour).  For example,  the whole premise of this civil war is glossed over in just a word or two.   I wonder if Coetzee really needed to bring in this war element at all to  bring out his real messages (..on humanity and inner strength).<br />However  one cannot help feel but moved by poor Michael's travails.  It's a somewhat  depressing feeling rather than inspirational, but Coetzee does get his  views across one way or another.<br />I found Coetzee's Waiting for the  Barbarians to be a much better read.  It focuses much more sharply on the  human/psychological elements; it just works much better than Life and Times  of Michael K.<br />After all this, I must admit that I am not too familiar  with apartheid or South Africa (its people, geography).  I think South  Africans will get a much better appreciation for this novel.	2000-07-04

Reading The Water-Method Man is akin to watching a very early (pre-Annie Hall) woody Allen film.  Funny, a bit outrageous for its time, and fascinating to compare to later (and better) works.  The Water-Method Man  is very much like Garp (30 year old man struggling with adulthood), and has  a lot of similarity to Hotel New Hampshire (many quirky stories set in  Vienna).  It wouldn't take a rocket scientest to assume all of these novels  have some basis in Irving's own experiences and psyche.  The end product is  a humorous yet superficial read.  Folks expecting a rich, memorable story  (as found in Owen Meany and Son of a Circus) should look elsewhere.<br />For  those unfamiliar with John Irving novels, The Water-Method Man will appeal  to men (it's a bit sexist but far from vulgar), and those who can remember  the &quot;free spirit&quot; days of the late 60s/early 70s.  John Irving  fans, especially those with a soft spot for Garp, should definitely place  this book on their must read list.  I personally found it to be equal, if  not better, than Garp in every way.	2000-06-27

I've lived some 40+ years successfully avoiding all the lengthy Russian novels because I feared they'd either put me to sleep, or generate headaches.  Upon completing Crime and Punishment, given to me by a  colleague, I'm really annoyed for depriving myself from enjoying such a  literary classic.<br />Crime and Punishment is, as you would expect, a  long-ish and wordy novel.  And the character's names, and nicknames, are  confusing to me (a non-Russian).  But the overall murder story is very  absorbing, as are the tangential subplots.  This is NOT a murder mystery;  the reader knows who committed the crime central to the story.  However its  deep psychological analysis as to why the crime was committed and how it  affects the criminal afterwards is extremely well done (without being  preachy).<br />Crime and Punishment, while somewhat cumbersome, is NOT a  difficult read.  I heartily recommend those who are fans of popular crime  novels (eg, John Grisham novels) should &quot;move up&quot; and give it a  try.  It's a very rich read.  ...and you'll be able to impress your friends  on telling them you read it!	2000-06-22

Every Man for Himself chronicles the lives of a several wealthy passengers on the Titanic.  The sinking of the Titanic, while making the end of the book a rather emotional read, does not compensate for the dreary,  impersonal narration which characterizes most of the novel.  The wealthy  passenges involved are pretentious, insecure, and thoroughly unlikeable  idiots.  Similar emotional traumas have been played out in much better  novels than this.  Worse, Ms. Bainbridge focuses too much time on the  dialogue between the main characters.  For much of the novel you forget  that they are on a ship, let alone on the Titanic.<br />Every Man for Himself  is certainly not a bad novel.  It's just very ordinary, .. a wasted  opportunity.	2000-06-15
2426508:US	50667536	R28WOV7UP04ZHP	0679722661	156744649	An Artist of the Floating World	Books	5	12	12	N	N	complexity unraveled with a gentle hand	Ishiguro is a master of subtlety and subdued emotions.  His leading characters seem to wear a Japanese Noh mask to conceal deep-rooted trauma.  Such restrained emotions work especially well where the leading characters  are Japanese since, of course, Japanese people are known for their  restraint (in order to harmonize with others).  Ishiguro uses this  methodology to glorious effect with this novel's complex story of an artist  who lives much of his adult life through a very turbulent era in Japan  (1930-1950). In time, piece by piece, he reconciles the changes in society,  lifestyle, his family and, lastly, himself.<br />As an added benefit, Ishiguro  does a brilliant job in capturing the mood, scenery, and feeling of  post-war Japan.  The carnage of the war transcended every aspect of the  country and its people.  But miraculously, Ishiguro paints this picture  with an optimistic (yet not rose-colored) flair which gives the book an  uplifting feel.<br />I think An Artist of the Floating World will appeal  especially to older readers.  Surviving the  war, the rath of youthful  &quot;know-it-all&quot;s and criticism of one's peers is an inspiration.	2000-06-13

Trilby is the popular 1890s novel which introduced the word &quot;svengali&quot; into the English language.  Simply stated, Trilby is story of three male British artists living the carefree life of 1850s  bohemian Paris.  Amongst their clique of artists and musicians is Trilby, a  peasant girl with a heart of gold but no artist (or musical) talent, and  Svengali, a talented yet sinister character.  Svengali, through mysterious  means, &quot;possesses&quot; Trilby's mind/soul and transforms her into a  operatic zombie.  Although a bit contrived by today's standards, this  &quot;evil man possessing young, innocent girl&quot; theme has been  repeated in such enduring pieces as Dracula (written only a couple years  after Trilby) and Phantom of the Opera.<br />Unfortunately, Trilby is not fine  literature.  The portrait of bohemian life is definitely viewed through  rose-colored glasses, and du Maurier's anti-semitic descriptions of the  Jewish Svengali is rather vulgar (by today's standards).<br />Overall Trilby  is a curiousity piece which probably won't appeal today's readers.  It's  decline into obscurity is justified.	2000-06-08

His life is completely turned upside-down with the arrival of a superior  officer who takes a brutal hand to &quot;tame&quot; the already docile  native population (&quot;the barbarians&quot;).<br />However Coetzee, without  being heavy-handed, peels back the human drama about all the people  involved .  The overall effect is devastating, and it is oh-too-easy to  believe how such a nightmare is probably being re-played in life somewhere  in the world everyday.<br />Waiting for the Barbarians is very similar, almost  too similar, to Heart of Darkness (by Joseph Conrad).  However, in my  opinion, Coetzee's story is much more accessible - it should appeal to a  wider audience.<br />I'm looking forward to reading other works of Coetzee.   He is clearly a very talented writer.	2000-06-05

It's sort of a fairy tale for grown-ups.  All the characters take place in this large kingdom/castle called Gormenghast, and the people are roughly European and Christian.  The  story involves the happenings of the royal family, its servants, and the  new-born heir (named Titus Groan) to the throne.<br />What makes this rather  unappealing (at least on the surface) story work is the enormous  descriptive power of Peake's writing.  It's as if there is a direct  connection from his mind to his pen.  And the characters, and their  dialogue, are most memorable.  Everyone, even the not-so-nice people, are  huggable.  Many of the characters will remind the readers of a beloved  dithering aunt or uncle who are, despite everything, near and dear.<br />I  strongly recommend Titus Groan as alternative reading.  It might appeal to  fans of Lord of the Rings and/or Watership Down, although bear in mind that  everyone's imagination is different (so it's not useful to dwell on  comparisons).	2000-06-01

He glorifies his reclusive behaviour, and is extremely set in his ways. However his life is completely turned upside-down by a chance encounter with a pigeon. A plain ol' pigeon! Sounds silly? Well, Suskind presents this story in a very careful, controlled fashion. He effectively, and tersely, describes how someone who is &quot;living on the edge&quot; psychologically can simply unravel. I thought the story was most compelling, not silly. Readers of Suskind's more famous work, Perfume, will enjoy The Pigeon.<br />My only gripe with The Pigeon is its packaging.  It's really a novella or short story, not a novel.  And as such I hope the publishers might consider including other Suskind short stories, which are seemingly unknown in the English-speaking world.	2000-05-31

Perfume is a rare delight.  It's unique, intelligent story of a man with an incredible sense  of smell (bloodhounds would be envious) who uses his natural gift for  diabolical purposes.  It is also written with a certain panache which is  often lacking in the more popular gothic/horror novels.  It also rewards  the reader with a shocking (and macabre) ending.  Savour it, and  enjoy.<br />While the story does involve murders, Perfume does not dwell upon  violence or gore.  However there are strong sexual undertones.  So it's  best that parents not share Perfume with children under 15.<br />Finally, I  would also recommend Suskind's novella &quot;The Pigeon&quot;. Patrick  McGrath's &quot;Dr. Haggards Disease&quot; and &quot;Spider&quot; also  share Perfume's excellence in literary quality and gothic nature.	2000-05-30

I  enjoyed the book because:<br />- it taught me about the longitude problem, and  its impact on the world (especially commerce)<br />- it inspired me with the  tale of the uneducated man who solved the problem through a lifetime of  perserverence.<br />While Longitude doesn't bury the reader with technobabble,  folks with an engineering/scientific  acumen will probably enjoy it most.   I wouldn't recommend the book to children under 15.<br />Bottom line: simple  book, great story.  It will make you want to visit Greenwich if you come to  London.  Being a London resident, I'll be there next week!	2000-05-18

Written some 20+ years ago, it's about a rather frustrated-with-life English literature lecturer, his bewildered wife, and their sex-crazed neighbors.  It's all a wonderful  farce with biting satire around the edges.  Much of the humor has sexual  undertones, but Wilt never turns vulgar.<br />Unless you find mild doses of  profanity unacceptable, or sexual humor (about lesbianism, wife-swapping,  etc) to be unfunny or distasteful, I think most everyone will love Wilt.  Americans won't find it &quot;too British&quot;, and the 1970s setting  seems quaint rather than dated (..it's not like reading a screenplay of the  Brady Bunch).  However the material is probably not suitable for those  under 15 years old.<br />Buy it and start laughing.	2000-05-17

A colleague described Flashman as &quot;Forrest Gump on drugs&quot;, which isn't quite correct.  Like Forrest Gump Flashman (..a fictional character) magically turns up at all the most memorable moments in history.  However  unlike Forrest, Mr. Flashman is cad and, surprisingly, a marginally  likeable person (whereas Forrest Gump is completely sugar-coated).<br />This  first Flashman novel quickly reviews Flashman's childhood and how he, quite  fantastically, enters the military and dives into rather incredible battles  in the outer reaches of the 19th century British Empire.  What really  shocks the reader is that while Flashman isn't real, all the horrors (and  shame) of this British battles (in Afghanistan) were real.  Truth is indeed  stranger than fiction.<br />The author tells the story in a rather  tongue-in-cheek fashion.  Flashman is an immature rascal and skirt-chaser,  with a tendency to get out of trouble through unbelievable luck.  His  travails are meant to be unbelievable, and all in good fun.<br />However after  reading Flashman I noticed that there are no credible female characters in  the entire novel.  All the women are either conniving bimbos, or ugly and  &quot;not worth bothering&quot;.  While maybe this can be partially  forgiven in light of the leading character being a sexist brute, I believe  most women would find this novel to be mildly offensive (at best).  For all  others, read and enjoy.  I certainly look forward to reading the next in  the Flashman series.	2000-05-16

Valley of the Dolls).  Her books were certainly the hottest sellers during the late 1960s/early 1970s.  Ms. Susann, perhaps due to jealousy,  was blasted by other novelists (such as Truman Capote) for being, at best,  a marginal writer.  Recently I had the opportunity to read a Susann novel,  The Love Machine, which I found in the basement of a used bookstore in  London priced at only 50 pence.  In retrospect I was ripped-off.<br />The Love  Machine is soap opera, not unlike Dallas, set in 1960s New York.  Its main  character is Robin Stone, head of a fictional TV network's news department.   It seems Mr. Stone, a 40-ish year old hunk, is absolutely adored by every  woman fortunate/unfortunate enough to see him.  Stone is great in bed, has  a great body, yet has &quot;cold eyes&quot; (..all of this is repeatedly  mentioned throughout the book).  Mr. Stone, for his part, lives on double  vodkas, never exercises, and seems to be devoid of any interesting  characterics ... but is loaded and, indeed, enjoys a startling sex life.   Yet he realizes something is wrong (..after all, he shouts out &quot;mommy,  mommy!&quot; in his sleep).  Seeing a psychiatrist reveals some startling  info about his early childhood which, for anyone else would lead to years  of psychotherapy, Robin shrugs off and is &quot;cured&quot; by the next  chapter!<br />I found all this to be so bad that it is almost good.   Furthermore, Jacqueline Susann portrays women as neurotic hussies with  absolutely no self-confidence.  Why they would risk destroying marriages,  go through cosmetic surgery, etc, just to win over Robin Stone is, well,  anyone's guess (power?  money?).  I also can't understand why women would  buy such a book where they are portrayed as such losers.<br />But all is not  bad.  There are a couple of interesting subplots involving wannabe TV stars  who, surprisingly, have little concern for Robin Stone.  These mediocre  talents fight and claw their way to the top - proving that mediocrity  doesn't mean failure (like this novel and Ms. Susann!).  It's all very  nasty, but deliciously compulsive reading.<br />I really cannot recommend this  novel to anyone with perhaps the exception of loyal Susann fans (who  probably read this 30 years ago).  Younger folks might find the 1960s  setting to be rather dated.	2000-05-16

It attempts to chronicle the budding Zionist movement and anti-semitic attitudes of Victorian society, and combine it with a more traditional George Eliot soul-searching  story of a young woman (a gentile who has a complex relationship with  Daniel Deronda, the young Englishman who discovers he is a Jew).  While  many people have quibbled about various details of the story, with some  justification, the overall impact is one of awe.  It's amazing how an  accomplished writer defies popular criticism and explores a subject matter  which was, at the time, politically incorrect.  <br />Strictly speaking,  Daniel Deronda isn't quite the same level of immaculate fiction as  Middlemarch.  So I think George Eliot fans will be somewhat disappointed.   But on the positive side, the book is much more accessible (ie, easier to  read).  And the subject matter makes it required reading for everyone  interested in modern Judaism/Zionism.  It's fascinating to compare how Jews  were perceived during the mid-1800s relative to today (..in western  Europe).<br />Finally, the Penguin Classic edition of Daniel Deronda has both  great Notes and Introductory sections (which, oddly, is supposed to be read  AFTER reading the book).	2000-05-15

These novels exhibit not only intriguing stories but also show the effectiveness  of writing in the first person.  The Grotesque is McGrath's first novel.  Although it shows the promise of his capabilities as an author, the book  does not compare to his later works.<br />The Grotesque is a relatively  light-hearted &quot;gothic comedy&quot;.  It contains the requisite spooky  house, sinister butler, a murder, and some strange happenings.  But it is  all rather tongue-in-cheek.  This comedy aspect disarms the scary  elements, which all seems to trivialize the novel.  It comes off as a good  made-for-TV movie script, and not a serious novel.  In fact the  characterizations in The Grotesque are surprisingly weak.<br />So The  Grotesque is a &quot;McGrath-light&quot; sort of novel.  I recommend seeing  the film version of it, which is probably available on video, and invest  your time on his other novels.	2000-05-15

It's hard for me to give an objective review of any material by McGrath since I think his writing style is so excellent and remarkably compact.  However beyond style, his material is always interesting (especially for  those who enjoy the macabre).<br />In a very broad sense, Asylum is like Dr.  Haggard's Disease from a woman's perspective.  A middle-aged woman is  &quot;possessed&quot; by an uncontrollable love for someone who is rather  .. unlovable (as most homicidal psychopaths perhaps are), yet she is fully  aware of this possession and its inevitable outcome.  Asylum re-enforces  the notion that love is blind, which in this case is a very bad  thing.<br />Unlike McGrath's other novels, Asylum presents a completely  plausible story (and therefore, in my opinion, it is not a gothic novel).   So it should have wider appeal than his other works.  I also encourage  readers of Asylum to buy Dr. Haggard's Disease, which is actually a more  focused and &quot;intense&quot; read (..from a male perspective).	2000-05-02

Kiss of the Spider Women (KSW) is a play (..not a novel) set in a prison cell circa 1978 Argentina.  It consists almost entirely of dialogue between two male prisoners: a homosexual (imprisoned for corrupting a minor), and a revolutionary.  Sounds dreary?  Actually, it's a very interesting read  about two very different people with a lot in common.<br />However I do  recommend seeing the film KSW before reading the book.  The film is  generally quite faithful to book, and it is very well made.<br />But bear in  mind KSW is very unconventional.  Puig does have his own personal  political/social statements strewn throughout the play, and it can be  awkward to read since Puig chose to skip some niceties such as telling the  reader who is doing the talking at any given time (although eventually one  does follow the rythem easily enough).	2000-04-25

I chose Spider over Dr. Haggard's Disease because, well, I didn't think reading about a man's obsession about a former lover would be particularly  new or interesting.  So I first read Spider, which was very enjoyable.  I  then read Blood &amp; Water, a collection of McGrath's earlier short  stories.  Finally, I was ready for Dr. Haggard.  What I mistake!  I should  have read this book first because, as fine as McGrath's other books are,  this is far superior.<br />Like Spider, the narrator of this book is the main  character (Dr. Haggard).  One is immediately absorbed by the persona of Dr.  Haggard - a rather pathetic individual.  His obsession of lost love is so  painfully moving that it almosts hurts to read it.  Anyone who has had  difficulty getting over a relationship, or knows of anyone who has remained  broken-hearted to an extreme extent would relate very well to Dr. Haggard.   This is wonderful literature.<br />Of course being a writer of gothic novels,  Dr. Haggard's Disease slowly takes on an unusual twist (which I won't  reveal).  But it really is just a natural progression of Dr. Haggard's  &quot;disease&quot;.<br />While relatively easy to read, I wouldn't recommend  this novel to teenagers.  The subject matter is too somber, too intense.   For all others, buy this book ... ok?  You won't regret it.	2000-04-17

I'm often asked what are Japanese people like (ie, their behaviour in society).  From now on I'll simply advise people to  read A Pale View of Hills.  It beautifully (and economically) portrays  Japanese people as they deal with social issues.  As an added bonus,  Ishiguro is very descriptive of post-war Nagasaki - one can almost feel the  humidity and smell the odors.<br />If I might sin and compare this book to the  popular Memoirs of a Geisha, A Pale View of Hills is much more understated  and less fanciful.	2000-04-05

While the story starts off in a straightforward fashion, it gradually pulls the reader into  the mind of Spider ... someone who is anything but straightforward.  It's  like the story from the movie Psycho being told by Norman Bates.  Very  creepy.<br />Spider takes place in 1930s/1950s east London.  McGrath captures  the atmosphere of this environment very nicely - it greatly enhances to the  sense of gloom.<br />Finally, McGrath is a very 'economical' writer.  His  narrative is rather easy to follow, and his novels are short (yet  complete).  Other authors (such as Stephen King) should take notice.	2000-04-04

I had steered clear from Jane Eyre because I had imagined it was some frivilous Victorian-era romance novel, suitable only to junior high school girls.  Well I'm glad I invested the time to prove that was wrong!<br />Jane  Eyre is, ultimately, a story of human values and the serious choices in  life we all must make from time to time.  While not an especially plausible  story, it is moving and thought-provoking.  I certainly think it would make  for required reading for all teenagers; it delivers an excellent message  (IMHO) contrary to what seems an obsession of young(er) people of money,  good-looks, and &quot;independence at all costs&quot;.<br />As a slight  demerit, Jane Eyre isn't the best written novel.  Some of the  characterizations are weak, and the novel lacks the powerful prose of the  works from George Eliott.  And the story is a bit wobbly in the beginning.  But put all this aside and enjoy.	2000-03-23

Rushdie seems to relish in introducing whimsical characters and side-stories to balance the rather disturbing elements of  Indian(/Pakistani) society.<br />Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find  Midnight's Children to be a masterpiece.  It often becomes a tedious read  as Rushdie seems to elaborate on his characters into needless detail.  And  the fantastical elements of the story are, well, a bit over the top.   Having said this, this book is a must read for people who are fascinated  with modern India (..such as myself).<br />While comparing novels is a  dangerous (and unfair) game, I have to recommend Son of a Circus by John  Irving over Midnight's Children.  Both share the same overall theme (story  on modern India without taking itself too seriously), with Irving's novel  being a much better read (funnier, less fussy on details, generally easier  to read).	2000-03-17

Well gents, get over it.  Don't deprive yourself any longer!<br />I read Memoirs of  a Geisha because I lived in Japan for a number of years and, well, it's  unusual to find a mainstream novel involving that country (or its people).   But I didn't expect much.  Well, the book was simply great.  The novel just  oozes with the feeling(/taste/smell) of Japan. Read the other reviews for  further accolades.  However I can't find the words to describe how well the  author succeeds in transporting the reader to mid-20th century Japan.<br />So  why didn't I give it 5 stars?  The author fails to fully develop some  characters, which becomes increasing evident towards the end of the novel.   If it weren't for this I think Geisha could easily become a modern classic  by anyone's standards.<br />...and I can't wait until they make it into a  movie!<br />(PS - other great books involving Japan include Spring Snow and  The Sound of the Waves, both by Mishima.)	2000-02-16
2634906:US	50667536	R1QQ78IAU5RBEB	0345387651	394884897	The Cider House Rules	Books	4	16	18	N	N	a delightful Irving novel, but not his best effort	Plainly put, John Irving writes delightful fiction.  His characters are interesting (and quirky), and invariably he finds something funny about everyday people, places and things.  The Cider House Rules has all this.   It also has a way of disarming the very contentious abortion/pro-life issue  without taking itself too seriously.  <br />However for John Irving newbies I  suggest proceeding directly to Owen Meany.  That (later) work of Irving is  much more moving, and is considered by many to be his masterpiece.	2000-02-14

Sure, the author does use the English language brilliantly.  But perhaps too brilliantly; some passages take repeated reading to understand what is going on!  <br />But the most  frustrating aspect of this book is the characters.  None of them are the  kind of people you'd want to know.  And I never met any people who talk  drival about love, relationships, their insecurities, etc.  Worse, one of  the characters is a thinly disguised D.H. Lawrence - and this character is  the worst! :-)<br />I was very disappointed with this novel, but not with its  author.  With such a rich command of the English language I can only hope  that he had put it into better use ... and thus deserving his fine  reputation.	2000-01-31

Although I'm a bookworm I've really never cared for science fiction.  Consider Phlebas was given to me by someone who thought that it can win me over.  It didn't, but it didn't miss by much.<br />Story  aside, Iain M. Banks is clearly a very talented writer.  Consider Phlebas  is literature, and not some &quot;sci-fi trash&quot;.  Obviously a great  amount of thought and sweat went into defining his creative worlds,  species, battle sequences, etc.  Everything was well-planned.<br />Unfortunely  despite the author's best efforts I couldn't really care much about the  story overall.  Perhaps because I know, of course, it's complete fantasy I  couldn't feel connected to these mythical alien beings.  However I did find  some very interesting &quot;vignettes&quot; where alien beings behaved in  ways which, no doubt by the authors design, made me think &quot;gee, could  this happen now on Earth?&quot;.  Very clever indeed!<br />Sci-fi fans will  love Consider Phlebas.  Others will consider it to be nothing more than a  sequence of Star Trek-like episodes, with some being better than others.	2000-01-31

Some stories come off well (eg, Son of a Circus), others flop (Hotel New Hampshire).  In Owen Meany  everything works; one has to been in awe of how such a story can be so  brilliantly conceived and executed.<br />I'd rather not divulge any bits of  the story; read the other reviews, at your own risk, if you want to learn  more.  However I'd like to simply say that Owen Meany is the only book I've  heard mentioned by three different friends of three different nationalities  as being &quot;the best book they've ever read&quot;.  Is it the best book  I've ever read?  Not sure, but at least it's an honorable mention.<br />Oh,  some people might find the book offensive.  It does have some foul  language, sexual overtones, and makes some controversial inferences  regarding Christianity.  Having said this, the book is otherwise suitable  to everyone over the age of 16.	2000-01-24

I first have to say that I am very glad to have read the USA Trilogy.  Dos Passos has ingenuously conveyed the lifestyle, hopes and dreams of Americana during the first quarter of the 20th century.  And similar to  James Michener novels, I've found it to be an education rather than just a  collection of stories woven into a novel.<br />But, surprisingly, it's hard to  recommend this trilogy.  After several hundred pages the interwoven stories  format get a bit tiresome, with some stories concluding unsatisfactorily  (ie, you wonder why he bothered at all).  This is sad because the overall  effect of the trilogy is one of awe.  And a couple of the stories are very  gritty and sad, along the lines of F. Scott Fitzgerald novels.<br />However if  you are keenly interested in the early labor movement in America,  especially the darker side on how businesmen/politicians treated labor  organizers, then this book is compulsory reading.	2000-01-24
2664351:US	50667536	R2P51C467D0QZF	0684872153	698161422	Angela's Ashes:  A Memoir	Books	3	0	1	N	N	educational autobiography..	Angela's Ashes has a lot going for it.  It describes an absolutely horrific childhood in Ireland during the 1930s/1940s.  I had no idea there was so much poverty in Ireland only a generation ago.  Very eye-opening.   The book is also very accessible (ie, easy to read).<br />But upon finishing  the novel I didn't quite understand what drove folks to survive through  such hardship, and why most seemed to be fatalist about their plight.   While I can understand that perhaps Frank McCourt, as a child, didn't have  much thought on the matter, surely later on in his teens (towards the end  of Angela's Ashes) developed firm opinions on his parents, his environment,  etc.  This would have made the book more thought-provoking and less of a  &quot;childhood from hell&quot; documentary.<br />Having said all this,  Angela's Ashes is a great achievement.	2000-01-24

I was expecting a novel of tremendous stature to justify its legendary reputation.  However the story drags on and on.  Worse, it seems that Melville is so in love with the  whaling industry that he feels compelled to give the reader a lesson on  whale anatomy, the different types of whales and the differing types of  blubber they produce.  Interesting?  Not for me.<br />Most surprisingly, I  found the story to get boring once they went to sea.  At the beginning,  while at port, I found the characterisations and the discussion about the  whaling communities to be interesting.<br />Bottom line: I can't understand  how anyone could like this novel.  It was a PAINFUL read.	2000-01-17
2681781:US	50667536	R2V7HUMHYFPV4Y	055321229X	586419329	Silas Marner (Bantam Classics)	Books	2	3	9	N	N	great writer, insignificant book	If compared to Eliot's best (Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss), Silas Marner is almost a disgrace.  The brilliant literary style of Eliot seems all but gone, and the story could have easily been dispensed with in a form of a  short story.  The story, taken on its own, is heart-warming.  But there is  so much &quot;background noise&quot; to contend with.  Overall this book  should be a definite miss, even for Eliot fans (like me!).<br />In addition  I'm quite surprised this novel is used as part of the English literature  curriculum in many schools (here in England at least).  I feel sorry for  those young minds having to wade through this.  I hope schools will choose  Mill on the Floss instead despite its length.	2000-01-12

As other reviewers have pointed out, it is really a Philosophy 101 textbook wrapped into a novel.  Not surprisingly it bites off more than it can chew; there  is simply too much philosophical discussion to simply read through as a  novel.  At times it becomes a very slow, torturous read.<br />But it almost  works.  After about half way through Sophie's World becomes more a novel,  and the ending is rather clever (perhaps too clever for some).<br />Overall  I'm glad I read it, but it would be hard to recommend.	2000-01-12

This was my first (of four, so far) George Eliot novel.  It's also my favorite.  Unlike Adam Bede or Silas Marner, I found the characters to be interesting and enjoyable.  No, it's not a finely-crafted piece of  literature like Middlemarch.  And it might be a bit on the melodramatic  side.  But for some odd reason I found the story to be ultimately quite  moving.<br />Other folks who I gave the book to gave it mixed results.  No one  disliked it, but most found the &quot;brother-sister&quot; element to be a  bit corny.  And pardon my sexism, but I thought the book would appeal more  to women than men (since the main character is a teenage girl).  Not so.  This book is definitely &quot;not for women only&quot;.<br />I imagine if you  have a sentimental streak through your bones you will probably love this  book.	2000-01-11
2737981:US	50667536	R3UQLFGUBLQ0UK	0375753753	165299353	The House of Mirth (Modern Library 100 Best Novels)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	interesting, ultimately moving	This is the third novel by Wharton I've read (the other two, of course, are Ethan Frome and The Age of Innocence).  Unlike the others, The House of Mirth is an accessible read with characters one can relate to.  Wharton's  attention to detail is impressive (yet slightly boring), and the subtlety  of how the story moves from fluff to tight human drama is  superb.<br />Finally, despite being written a century ago the main theme of  The House of Mirth is very much applicable to today's materialistic yuppie  society.  Great stuff!	1999-12-01
2738115:US	50667536	RHXRCYR0AO64H	0684842378	12564777	The Age of Innocence	Books	3	6	8	N	N	not her best, but a worthy read	Edith Wharton is one of a handful of authors blessed with an extremely rich writing style.  Her command of the English language is extraordinary.  However she does not put this talent to its best advantage with this novel.   More economical wording and, sorry to say, a better story would have been  appreciated.<br />Having said this, I found her attention to detail on New  York and its (forgotten) upper class society to be very absorbing.  The  film version of The Age of Innocence didn't (and probably couldn't) reflect  this detail and, in comparison to the novel, seemed  two-dimensional.<br />Finally, I would recommend The House of Mirth over this  novel.  While it doesn't discuss NY society in such detail, the overall  story is much more moving and ... *personal* to the reader.	1999-12-01
