Winter can be a cold, lonely and dangerous time for a bird that didn't fly south. But in The Bird in Santa's Beard, help comes from Santa Claus himself. Santa invites the cold and hungry bird to nest in the warm safety of his beard. During the long winter Santa and the bird develop a deep friendship. They solve problems and share the secret of Santa's helpers. And when Christmas morning arrives, Santa receives a grand gift just for him. <br /> <br />The Bird in Santa's Beard is the story of an unlikely friendship between Santa and a bird and how a simple kindness makes a difference.  <br /> <br />I so enjoyed learning how Santa came to have all of his helpers. Children will enjoy this book with a subtle and important message. The photographs are wonderful and a nice change of pace from other illustrated books. The cover is exactly the way I have always pictured jolly old Santa.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: This is a splendid addition to a child's Christmas library. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

And when a 'bad thing' rocks your life, a deep and abiding faith can bring you through to the other side, if you believe God's directive: Do not be afraid. <br /> <br />Claire Holland is a woman of deep faith. She has a wonderful life with God at its center. Claire loves her husband, Dan and children, Kate and Spencer. The Hollands dreamed of a large family, but several miscarriages left them emotionally wounded. To prevent further emotional pain, they decided on a vasectomy. <br /> <br />One night, leaving a mall, Claire is the victim of a heinous crime. Claire's faith, marriage and family are changed forever.  <br /> <br />Why the Sky is Blue by Susan Meissner is told from the perspective of Claire and her daughter Kate. It is a story of personal sacrifice, healing hearts and redemption.  <br /> <br />Meissner is fast becoming one of my favorite Christian fiction writers. She is a master storyteller who can deftly weave a thought-provoking plot with realistic, fully developed characters. She explores difficult subjects in a compassionate manner and that adds immeasurably to her work. Her fiction compels me to think, really think, about my faith and what would I do if a 'bad thing' happened to me. Would I follow God's direction, which might include personal sacrifice? Or would I forsake my beliefs for the 'easy way.' <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Read Meissner's book and examine the strength of your faith and convictions. If you have the answer you'll understand why the sky is blue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-10-12

Anyone who is interested in saving money, investing, or financial security who has not heard of Robert Kiyosaki or Rich Dad, Poor Dad has been on another planet. Since 1997 Kiyosaki has built a financial education empire around the concept expressed in his first book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Rich Dad's Classics is a boxed set of three of Kiyosaki's books in their most up-to-date printing.  <br /> <br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad: In this the original, the author details the things he learned from his \\"two fathers.\\" The first, his biological father, was a well-respected educator who spent most of his life needing to earn money to pay for things that demonstrated his status. Since he worked for money rather than putting money to work for him he is referred to as the \\"Poor Dad.\\" <br /> <br />The \\"Rich Dad\\" was his best friend's father. He spent less than he earned and put the difference to work in building a business, developing land and real estate, etc. Since he put money to work for him he was referred to as the \\"Rich Dad.\\" <br /> <br />The book reveals the simple truths: Those that build wealth and have money working for them, put to work every day. The average person is unaware of this simple truth. It is understanding what an asset is (something that generates money passively) rather than what it means from an accounting standpoint. If you have to pay into something every month, it is a liability because you owe. When it pays you it is an asset. For most people, then, their house, viewed on a balance sheet as an asset is really a liability. Though there may be equity there is a constant service on the debt. <br /> <br />The Cash Flow Quadrant: In the second book of the series, the author explores the four positions one can be in with respect to money: employee, boss, investor, self-employed. He argues that education is geared toward teaching people that the \\"e\\" or \\"s\\" quadrants are good places to be: get a secure job and save for retirement or get into a good profession andsave for retirement.  <br /> <br />Kiyosaki, on the other hand explains that real wealth and ultimate financial security is in either being a boss of your own business that leverages the efforts of others or being an investor who either invests in things that produce a positive cash flow or businesses that do the same. In each of the first two books, there are simple steps to move from employee to investor. <br /> <br />Rich Dad's Guide to Investing: In the final book, the author drills down into the fourth quadrant, the investor. He explores how people can move into the \\"I\\" quadrant while staying in one of the other quadrants. This book is really a financial literacy book. Here Kiyosaki demystifies what financial literacy is all about, what you need to know to start investing, and what it takes to succeed long term in the \\"I\\" quadrant.  <br /> <br />He also deals with the feelings that this whole process is likely to raise in the average person--like what happens when you make an investment mistake (and you will)? Do you become a liar, a blamer, a justifier, a quitter, or a denier (there's one more--the only place to really go--but you'll have to read the book to find that out! <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: If you want to be either a business owner or an investor this series of books should not only be on your bookshelf, but read, underlined, and applied. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Joe Gunther is the lead investigator for the Vermont Bureau of Investigation. A simple barn fire turns into a murder investigation. Young Bobby Cutts picked the wrong time to check on a cow about to calf. It cost him his life. <br /> <br />And then there are other barn fires--that all seemingly accidental up to now, also turn out to be acts of arson. But why? And who? These questions lead Joe from Vermont to Newark, New Jersey and the mob. But getting a lead on a mob-connected arsonist isn't easy. They protect their own. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Joe's girl friend, Gail Zigman, a Vermont State Senator, is getting threatening notes. She won't tell Joe because she believes they're related to legislation she opposes. But what if they're not? <br /> <br />Then there are those secret land purchases. Farms are being bought up in a pattern. But what does the pattern mean? Some of the purchases seem legitimate and some purchases happened after accidents and fires. And all of the purchases trace back to the same real estate office run by one of the area's most reputable men. <br /> <br />Joe and his sidekick, Willie, uncover the likely arsonist and find a connection to the land purchases, but in the process someone close to the arsonist gets killed and he vows revenge on Joe Gunther. He will hurt him in the same way he was hurt--and that means someone close to Joe is at risk. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: This book has all the elements you expect in a first-rate murder mystery--several credible suspects, villains you love to hate, reluctant heroes, unplanned outcomes, and ultimately a surprise resolution. The book is well-paced and gives you plenty to think about as you enjoy solving the murders along with Joe Gunther. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Anyone who listens to contemporary Christian music has heard the song, \\"Shout to the Lord.\\" Darlene Zschech sat down at her out-of-tune piano one day and put the Psalms to music as she vowed to \\"shout to the Lord\\" in her darkest hour. <br /> <br />One of the most moving stories she shares is that of Amy Newhouse, to whom the book is dedicated. Despite taunts and jeers from classmates she maintained her commitment to Jesus and to abstinence. Though this apparently made no difference, the influence of her life became evident when she was diagnosed with cancer in 1999. You'll have to read the book to find out what happens and how God used her in a mighty way. <br /> <br />There are more than a dozen stories in this small book about how God used this song to bless, reclaim, and restore people in the midst of pain, sorrow, loss, and more. But the book is more than that. It is a call to worship, truly worship God. It is about lifting up our hearts, our minds, and our voices to celebrate that God is with us in the midst of every thing that happens in our lives. It is about celebrating the fact that everything that happens can glorify God as we lift it up to Him. <br /> <br />As the song says,  <br /> <br />\\"Shout to the Lord All the Earth, Let Us sing <br />Power and Majesty, Praise to the King <br />Mountains Bow Down and the Seas Will Roar <br />At the Sound of Your Name <br />I Sing for Joy at the Works of Your Hands <br />Forever I'll love You, Forever I'll Stand <br />Nothing Compares to the Promise I Have in You.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: This small book not only shares details of that story and what Darlene learned from it, but also reveals some of the stories of how the song has touched people's lives around the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Following an introduction made through the thoughts and observations of a sexual predator, Broken Prey opens with the grizzly murder of a young woman who'd been scourged. Soon after, the sexual murder of a man is discovered. There seems to be little to connect the two until the authorities realize that both crimes included methods used by three currently incarcerated charismatic and powerful killers. <br /> <br />Lucas Davenport, working with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and his friend, Minneapolis Police Detective Sloan, get a crash course on interview techniques of the criminally insane when they visit the \\"Big Three\\" at St. John's hospital in an effort to figure out how they may be influencing the rampant escalation of heinous sex crimes from inside their isolation cells.  <br /> <br />Sandford introduces Ruffee Ignace, an egotistic, career-climbing Tribune reporter who has been contacted by the killer, giving him a public voice. Ignace is ruthless and willing to do anything for the story that will catapult him out of Minneapolis. I'm guessing we'll see him again!  <br /> <br />Luckily there are moments throughout the story like Davenport's search for the 100 Best Songs of the Rock Era for his new IPod. Most of the characters add their two cents worth, putting as much into their list choice as they do crime solving! Or there's Lucas' struggle to follow his Doctor-wife's \\"nutritional guidelines.\\" Lucas went home and ate a steak and onion low carb, low-fat microwave meal \\"that had apparently been purely made from coal tar and goobers perhaps seasoned with industrial phlegm.\\"  <br /> <br />Armchair Inteviews says: These humorous things provide welcome respites from the stress of wondering how close Sanford's plot follows real life psychotic sex murderers!

Police departments in many regions across the United States say methamphetamine now represents 70-80% of their drug cases. Why? Meth is a cheap buzz and can be homemade with over-the-counter chemicals and cold remedies. It's also very quick to addict the user. <br /> <br />Federal surveys indicate that: <br />- 12 million Americans have used meth. <br />- More than 6% of high school seniors have tried it at least one time. <br />- 4% of nation's 8th graders have used it once. <br />- 2004 more than 17,000 meth labs were seized, compared to 7,500 in 1999. <br />- Meth abusers now account for more than 55% of all the people who seek help for addiction. <br /> <br />Today the phenomenon has moved to the heartland, the Midwest, and is moving east into big cities. It is no longer the drug of choice just for outlaw motorcycle gangs. <br /> <br />A gram can sell for $125, ounce $1700, a pound $13,000. But the mid 1990s, meth users discovered that they could make a less-pure form by themselves by copying recipes found on the Internet. <br /> <br />The drug's lure is that it produces a: <br />-- stunning burst of energy, <br />-- a feeling of euphoria, <br />-- heightened power of concentration, <br />-- a buoyant sense of self esteem, <br />-- an enhanced sex drive. <br /> <br />Smoking meth brings as much as an 8 to 12 hour high and 50% of the meth stays in the body after 24 hours. Meth seduces people who work long hours and become exhausted and females who use it to lose weight. The rush makes people feel great, as it affects the part of the brain that rewards people for doing things needed for human survival. <br /> <br />Now that you understand the who, what and why, it's important that every citizen learns how this drug is invading our country, being made in city apartments, small towns and abandoned farms or cabins.  <br /> <br />The author, a senior writer and Chicago Bureau Chief for Newsweek, discusses mom and pop labs; women and meth; meth in the gay community; and young faces of meth. Prisons are bursting with meth users. Imagine being a child of meth users who don't sleep or eat for days while acting bizarre, and certainly not taking care of the children in their home. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: If you are a parent, get smart about meth so you know more than your teen does. If you are a citizen, understand the emotional and financial disaster that meth is bringing into your town. Johnson's stories will blow your mind and break your heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

I love reality TV. At least some of it. I watch each and every episode of Survivor and The Amazing Race. I've tuned into portions of The Bachlorette, The Mole and Big Brother (I didn't like that one at all). So when the book, So You Wannabe On Reality TV by Jack Benza hit my desk, I picked it up and began reading it immediately.     Whew! This is the book to read if you want to be on TV. I've decided that it is definitely not for me because I'm just too high maintenance and I don't want all of my flaws to be aired on national television. I can't take the humiliation! And I enjoy anonymity far too much. Oh, and my mother really, really loves me and I'd like to keep it that way.    Benza has experience with \\"reality\\" TV and shares his experience of participating in over thirty reality, dating, and game shows. He's also produced audition tapes for other \\"wannabe contestants.\\" He discusses the application traps, audition tapes, personal interviews, physical and mental tests and everything else connected to reality TV in a clear and straight-forward, no-holds-barred manner. And it's not always pretty.    If you want, really want, to break into reality TV, this just might be the book for you. It might also deter you from following that path, and even Benza would say, don't do it unless you're willing to play a part, be humiliated and suffer other \\"things\\" at the hands of the producers.    Armchair Interviews says: This book is not only helpful in navigating the reality TV path, but it is both a funny and scary look at this new phenomenon.	2005-10-09

Janette Oke was perhaps one of the first popular authors who brought the pioneers to the forefront of Christian fiction. Her characters were called to give up all security and to travel miles on uncomfortable, canvas-covered buckboard wagons with no hope of air-cushioned shocks; endure the roughest of climactic conditions with no thought of the comfort of micro-fleece; and stave off death with a fierce stubbornness.    Judith Miller follows in this tradition with First Dawn, yet with a twist. The first book in the Freedom's Path series from Bethany House Publishers contrasts the life of two families who choose to pursue land settlement in Kansas: a doctor and his family who live a life of privilege in Georgetown, Kentucky, and the Harbans, a family of former slaves who dream of farming their own land.    In the late 1800s, after the end of the Civil War and the freeing of the slaves, parts of the frontier states began courting former slaves to buy land and settle it for five dollars per homestead. The entrepreneurial dream of working for themselves coaxed many to travel hundreds of miles away from everything they'd ever known to help settle the west. Ezekiel Harban is such a man. Father to three daughters, he uproots the family and moves them from Kentucky to a new town being settled by Negroes: Nicodemus, Kansas, named for an African prince brought to America in chains and reportedly the first slave ever to buy his freedom.     Contrast this with Yankee doctor Samuel Boyle who married a Southern belle and moved to Kentucky. Yet with his staunch convictions about black men being treated as equals, he's never found his niche in the South and decides to start a new practice in Hill City, Kansas, the white settlement in the Solomon Valley. And so this storyteller begins to weave her storytelling magic.    Armchair Interviews says: Miller is a wonderful storyteller who unravels a fascinating part of history artfully and tastefully. The suspense is mild, but the story isa good one.	2005-10-09

All things happen for a reason--even the bad.  <br /> <br />Rese Barrett has recently purchased a vineyard in Sonoma with the intention of restoring it to its former glory and then opening an inn. After hiring Lance Michelli as chef and making him a partner in her business, she discovers that his grandmother, Antonia, used to live there. But they both possess titles to the property. In order to put things right, Rese and Lance travel to his home in the Bronx to discuss the problem with Antonia, whose health is now failing.  <br /> <br />Over seventy years before, Antonia was forced to suddenly leave following the murder of her father--and she had never been able to return. This story highlights the extreme culture shock that Rese experiences while visiting Lance's very Italian family. Having survived an attack on her life as a child by her own schizophrenic mother, Rese has learned to survive by overachievement and shutting people out. Though it is very difficult for her, through interactions with Lance's relatives, she learns what family is about and how to open up to others.  <br /> <br />Lance presents his grandmother her old diary that he found at the vineyard. As Antonia reads the old diary, she begins to tell Lance her own story, and together they dig into what really happened when she was forced to leave her home. What they find out shakes them both to the core of their faith and threatens Lance's newfound relationship with Rese.  <br /> <br />Set in modern-day Little Italy, as well as Sonoma of Antonia's youth and being a newlywed in 1931, this book is a sequel to Kristin Heitzman's earlier book, Secrets.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Unforgotten is a moving love story that is full of lessons on reconciliation, self-sacrifice, the curse of a vendetta, and the power of forgiveness.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

Rick Kupchella, author of Tell Me What We Did Today, is a TV news anchor and reporter in the Twin Cities. He's also a dad who wrote an important story to share with children about the everyday life of children. Warren Hanson is the illustrator of this book and of the classic, A Cup of Christmas Tea and the PEEF books. When these two men got together to create a storybook, it was a success. And it will delight children of all ages. <br /> <br />Life is made up of simple, everyday experiences. And sharing those experiences, real or made up, is a wonderful way for parents or grandparents to connect with their children or grandchildren. And that is what Kupchella's book accomplishes. It's a zany, rollicking, wild and fun ride into the real, the made up, and the big things and little things of life.  <br /> <br />I always enjoy rhyming children's books and those that allow children to interact. Kupchella's book does both. His prose is in rhyme and he asks silly questions that elicit responses, usually a Noooooooo, from the children. And Hanson's bright, big and bold illustrations are oh, so inviting. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Kupchella believes there is nothing better than sitting down at the day's end with your children and laughing with them. Reading Tell Me What We Did Today is one way to accomplish this. We recommend it highly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

I can't imagine that if would offend anyone. I believe all people desire a better place when they leave this world of \\"earthly hurts.\\" It speaks of the next place as a peaceful, serene, and quiet place that is familiar and provides a sense of belonging. <br /> <br />The words are lyrical and provide hope. And the illustrations are stunning. I so enjoyed the way the words swirled and looped across many of the pages. <br /> <br />While this book is for children from 4-8 years, it is perfect for anyone who has lost a loved one. Actually, it's even perfect to just sit and read and ponder at the end of a busy and perhaps difficult day. It will put things into perspective. <br /> <br />The Next Place is the third book that Hanson has both written and illustrated.

Between shifts she runs home for a shower and finds her no-good ex-husband, Bobby Ray in her trailer. He hands over five hundred dollars to her oldest daughter, no doubt raising Wanda Nell's suspicion, as he has never paid child support nor been able to hold onto any money. <br /> <br />She loudly runs him off before she leaves for her graveyard shift job, stocking shelves in a convenience store. As she returns home hours later, she finds that a flamingo decoration is missing from her yard. She discovers the flamingo in all its pinkness behind her mobile home, pierced through Bobby Ray's neck. <br /> <br />Quickly she becomes the main suspect in Bobby Ray's death. If the deputy in charge of the investigation, Elmer Lee Johnson, a high school friend of the departed, doesn't railroad Wanda Nell into prison, her wealthy, politically connected former mother-in-law will. She has to solve this crime to save her own hide. Her best friend, Mayrene, who wields a curling iron as well as a shotgun, is determined to help her friend. <br /> <br />Wanda Nell is a loving mother who will do anything to take care of her children. She also knows that her children aren't perfect and could be hiding evidence that will help solve the murder. <br /> <br />Between nosey neighbors, casino ruffians, a good ole boy network, and the spite of a bitter old woman, she seeks the truth that will keep her out of prison. <br /> <br />This was entertainment, but I think I knew some of these characters from a trailer park where I used to live.

With him, you travel on boats, taxis with human drivers or human energy, and every vehicle imaginable. Quoting Nathaniel Hawthorne, the author agrees ... \\"The soul needs air, a wide sweep and frequent change of it.\\" <br /> <br />He believes in \\"ala carte\\" travel to places with no restrictions, distractions or interruptions on plans--because you usually don't have any. <br /> <br />So he takes a trip that became this Does Your Meter Work, about the taxi drivers whose fees are negotiable. The author has wonderful stories; some that show the good or bad side of each culture and its people. Mostly he has been treated kindly by strangers as he thumbs (hitchhikes) his way from country to country. <br /> <br />Doing what he did takes nerve, undying faith in human nature and his personal ability to survive and thrive with something different every day of his travel. <br /> <br />My favorite line described standing in line \\"like the in and out box of humanity\\" as everyone on a bus was searched to ensure they were not a terrorist.

Those are the novels where a reviewer can only attempt to whet the reader's appetite and then simply allow them to discover the richness that exists within. The Widow of the South by Robert Hicks is just such a book. <br /> <br />Hicks has written a fictional account of the true story about the Civil War and Carrie Cradock. In Franklin, Tennessee, Carrie Cradock is mourning the loss of three of her children and is concerned about her husband's safety. The war is raging and Carrie and her slave, Mariah are left to run the plantation. <br /> <br />Canton Plantation, Carrie's home, is turned into a field hospital. During a brutal battle 9,000 Americans died and many others were wounded. The dead were buried on a neighboring plantation. Several years later, when the dead soldiers were in danger of being plowed under by the plantation's owner, Carrie reburied many in her own personal cemetery where she carefully tended the graves. <br /> <br />A wounded soldier, Zachariah Caldwell, is not of Carrie's class, yet he wakes in her feelings she didn't know she had. Their love for each other is not to be. And when they part, it is forever. But forever is not always the way life turns out. As an old woman, tending to her graves, the wounded soldier returns to ask a question. <br /> <br />Hicks has written a compelling, poignant and touching story of a woman whose circumstances shapes the person she will become. The characters are richly drawn and the disaster of war so real, it is frightening. In The Widow of the South, Hicks recreated a tragedy of American History that should not be forgotten. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: The Widow of the South is a must read that will leave you breathless. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

Harry Turtledove is the master and Drive to the East (the second book in the trilogy) is no exception. <br /> <br />Confederate president and dictator Jake Featherston learns that his own aircraft have killed U.S. president Al Smith who was in Philadelphia. Following in Smith's footsteps is the vice president, who has little experience. <br /> <br />The United States, at war, has been effectively cut in two parts with one side gaining back some ground in a divided nation. There is a black holocaust in Texas, led by Featherston's Freedom Party, and chaos and evil reign supreme throughout the land. <br /> <br />Turtledove's characterization is rich and thorough and the storyline is intriguing, captivating and frightening at the same time. I believe, however, it would be a stronger book with fewer characters and storylines. That is a minor issue however.

The Martyr's Song is the last of four in a series.

As far as I'm concerned Connelly is in the top five of modern-day mystery writers. With each book I say to myself that \\"he just can't top this one.\\" And I continue to be wrong. And The Lincoln Lawyer is no exception. It just has to be the absolute best Michael Connelly novel ever!<br /><br />Criminal defense attorney, Mickey Haller is a Lincoln Lawyer; meaning he works out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car. He's never sure if he would be able to recognize innocence if it stood in front of him. And he's not necessarily concerned whether his clients are innocent or not.<br /><br />A wealthy Beverly Hills realtor is arrested for attacking a woman in her home. This type of client is what Mick Haller calls a 'franchise case.' It's a big payday and the case appears to be an easy one. But after someone close to Mick is murdered, things become murky before they clear up. Mick is facing down pure evil and he'd better be at the top of his game if he wishes to get out of this case alive.<br /><br />Armchair Interviews says: The Lincoln Lawyer has everything; great characters, scintillating plot, action, evil, gritty issues, ex-wives and a hero who is unlikely. It is a 15 on a score of one to ten!	2005-10-04

If you want to see beauty, learn to view ordinary things in a new way, Campeau says. The author is currently a senior pastor of the fast-growing Christ Lutheran Church in Santa Clarita, California. <br /> <br />Campeau says in his introduction that the first key is finding uncommon joy at the center of common life--and that God is in the middle of it. The second key is to recognize the ways in which the simplest areas of life can also be the most profound areas for serving God. <br /> <br />If you read nothing but the questions at the end of each chapter--and give serious thought to the answer, you will be way ahead of things. But let's talk about the content leading up to those outstanding questions. My favorite is in the chapter, \\"Sometimes the giver is the gift.\\" If you have received a gift without knowing who gave it, how did you feel about receiving it? <br /> <br />The sections are: 1: Discover God on Ordinary Days and 2: Serving God in Ordinary Ways. <br /> <br />In the chapter on being needed, the author states that sometimes we need a break from being needed; when the pressures build, the sacrifice too exhausting, the times we want to run away and hide. Then you ponder: \\"I wonder if God needs me?\\" God has chosen to need you and me. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: This book would be a great tool for discussion by a church group because of the thought-provoking content and soul-searching questions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

I am a closet humor writer, but lucky for us, Pat is out of that closet and making us laugh. This is a mystery book, but I think of it as a humor book because I laughed more than I wondered \\"who done it.\\"    This is collection of six of Pat's short stories (10-15 pages), each with a hotdish (or casserole) as an integral part of the mystery. I make a killer hotdish, so I was intrigued.    As a humorist and a writer, we get the best of both. It helps to be from Minnesota, and maybe even Lutheran to enjoy this to the fullest, but the rest of you will giggle along. Stories have tongue in cheek titles like The Elder Hostile, Death by Idaho (potato), Hotdish to Die For. And the book ends with 18 hotdish recipes, many already in my metal 3x5 recipe box. If you don't know what a hotdish is, it a food staple of things from a can and tator tots, served at church festivals, dinners and funerals--and in the homes of women who attend those churches.    This book is as Minnesotan as Paul Bunyan and \\"going up north,\\" and her local points add to the flavor. Pat adds to the mix by putting fun back into dysfunctional.    Some great lines are:  -- In describing mismatched lovers: When it comes to love, all cats are grey in the dark.  -- In describing a man who had reached 30 without being married, or much of anything: He had little to give, so he had almost nothing to lose.  -- In talking about neighbors at the lake: As only long-time lake neighbors get to do, Jeff loved and hated every one of them.  -- In describing a woman on mood-altering drugs: Without her medicine, she got so much more done.

So when Jane steps out of her apartment one day and sees the beautiful \\"Christ Child,\\" her biological clock shifts into overdrive. <br /> <br />Jane identified the emptiness she feels. She has a nice apartment, a good job, and friends. What she doesn't have is a child; or a father for the child. Her true love, Sam died six years earlier and there have only been dates since then. So how does one have a baby without a man? Jane explores her options, while she dances around the typical family dysfunctions the world experiences if they have a family. And she meets a man just as she has decided on adopting a little girl from China. <br /> <br />And Baby Makes Two by Judy Sheehan is the tale of a woman who thought she couldn't be a parent, but underrated herself. Jane also found a man who wanted to be a boyfriend but couldn't be because he was still unhappily married to someone else. Then there is the sister who eloped and became dead to the family, but works at returning to the family while helping Jane with \\"life.\\" And Jane's newly widowed father couldn't understand his daughter's choices but learned how to accept.  <br /> <br />And Baby Makes Two is the warm, poignant, humorous adventure of a woman who wanted a child--and despite the lack of a man, made a family through adoption. It was new territory and she was fearful but she reached deep within herself, faced her fears and grew up and into a mommy. It is a happily ever after story. <br /> <br />As an adoptive mother of four Asian born children, I say this is a book long overdue for the bookshelves. <br /> <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: And Baby Makes Two is a fast, fun read but also will help women who want a child but didn't know about all the options.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

It is also a history book, if one can accept the literary license the author takes with history. Steve Haberman weaves World War II into his current-day Paris setting and the reader feels the tension of the days of Nazism throughout the book. <br /> <br />State criminal investigator Monsieur Stanislas Cassel is the grandson of a French Nazi collaborator. Cassel is ashamed of his past and strives to avoid anything that exposes it. He prefers to assure his low profile by immersing himself in his work of solving small crimes he calls his Little Miseries. <br /> <br />Cassel finds himself investigating the murder of an elderly man whose eyes, even in death, reflected his terror at the last image he saw. A connection between the man's death and elderly Nazi collaborators hiding out in Paris must exist, because the closer Cassel gets to discovering the murderer, the more he feels the pressure of his own family shame. <br /> <br />He meets a Jewish woman who lost her family in the World War II death camps, becomes fascinated with her, then learns she knows about his grandfather's collaboration with the Nazis. Even though she knows his dark family secret, she attempts to alert him that the Far Right political faithful are becoming active once again. <br /> <br />Reviewer Sharron Stockhausen served two terms as president of Twin Cities (Minnesota) Sisters In Crime. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: If you're looking for something different in a whodunit, consider Murder Without Pity. Haberman offers some interesting twists as he connects the fifty-plus years of history with mystery.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

Theda Krakow is living that truth in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

If it is murder, what could the motive be? <br /> <br />Clea Simon has a wonderful possibility for a series with Theda Krakow.

In the past it was harvested by Native American living in the northern and central states. <br /> <br />In her book Wild Rice For All Seasons Cookbook, Beth Anderson shares the history and lore of wild rice and some of the most delicious recipes for spring, summer, fall and winter, using this food.  <br /> <br />Wild Rice Almondine is a personal favorite of mine. It is fast and easy to prepare and the author includes interesting variations the reader may enjoy. The Herbed Wild Rice is wonderful with grilled chicken and a side salad. But the Webster's West Cream of Wild Rice Soup is absolutely mouth-watering! There are so many fabulous recipes in this book, that even someone like me, who avoids cooking, will be drawn to this cookbook. The result of preparing these dishes is worth the time and energy. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: You will be able to enjoy these tasty recipes all year long and that's a good thing.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

Morgan's fast-paced story, Woken Furies, is the third novel of a series featuring Takeshi Kovacs, and is set in the twenty-fifth century. Kovacs has experienced varied lives: marine, gang member, and as an envoy that doesn't negotiate much of anything. He mostly wrecked havoc. <br /> <br />Kovacs has returned to his home planet, Harlan's World in a pique--to say the least. He's been awakened from an almost-two-hundred-year digital storage and readied for a new mission. But Kovacs has his own idea of what his mission is to be. He protects a woman who may be someone from an earlier century, and he must fight what he believes is a younger version of himself.  <br /> <br />Morgan's novel has a little bit of everything: feuds, madness, crazy machines and questions of who can be trusted and who is untrustworthy. This is a wild ride and if you really enjoy science fiction, this is science fiction at its best. Be prepared to force yourself to breathe; it's that exciting. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: You'll be excitedly awaiting the next Morgan outing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

If you have young children, are you teaching them how to handle money? What about your teens? You are not alone...most of us were not taught about money by our parents either.

Faithless is the fifth book featuring Sara Linton, a Georgia pediatrician/coronor and her ex-husband Sheriff Jeffrey Tolliver. This one is just as harrowing as the previous books.  <br /> <br />Lena Adams, one of Jeffrey's deputies, is still dealing with her sister's death, and now she has to deal with an abortion, the result of being raped by her abusive boyfriend. The story opens with Sara and Jeffrey discovering a metal pipe sticking out of the ground. It is connected to a shallowly buried wooden box--with a young girl sealed inside.  <br /> <br />No girls are reported missing; but eventually they find she was Abigail Bennett, part of a large religious family that operates an organic farm on several properties on the edge of city. The girl did not die from asphyxiation, but was poisoned with cyanide. The family had just realized that she was missing. Jeffrey has to interview all the family members; and also the farm workers, assorted misfits--including some ex-convicts and drug addicts. The family recruited these people from large cities like Atlanta, then gave them a place to live and a small wage in exchange for their work. This workforce is very fluid, and many of them run away.  <br /> <br />Jeffrey and Sara work to try and untangle the webs of deceit and to discover the true motivation for Abigail's death. Was she killed because she was pregnant? Had she discovered something while doing the farm's accounting? How does her death relate to the beating death of Chip Donner, a bartender at the Pink Kitty strip joint? They had found a match book from the Pink Kitty hidden in Abigail's room, and Chip fled when the police tried to question him.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Slaughter delivers non-stop suspense and chills in this fifth book in her series; highly recommended for the stout of heart.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-29

Cross Bones is the eighth book in the Temperance Brennan series, which began with Deja Dead in 1997.  <br /> <br />In real life, Reichs is one of only 56 certified members of the American Board of Forensic Anthropology. Her books are extremely realistic and ring true in both her relationship with the police and with the victims and their families.  <br /> <br />In Cross Bones she begins investigating the shooting death of Avram Ferris, an orthodox Jew in Montreal and ends up in Israel, chasing down an extremely unusual ancient skeleton. She had been handed a photo of the skeleton, an excavation photo, and told by a stranger in the hallway outside the autopsy that this is why Ferris died. Tempe calls an old friend, Jake Drum, who has worked extensively excavating in Israel, and he is able to figure out that this skeleton was part of an unreported find in a cave on Masada. While the story seems a bit far-fetched (it does seem unlikely that the Montreal police would send officers to Israel to interview a suspect), it actually is based on fact, explained at the back of the novel.  <br /> <br />There are really two unusual skeletons here. First is the one in the picture of a middle-aged man who was buried at Masada, and whose existence was suppressed by the team that did the excavation. The short time Brennan has the bones, she extracts some bone for DNA testing, and also notices a tooth glued in that appears to be different. When she has that tested, it proves to be someone else's. Once in Israel with her Montreal police colleague Andrew Ryan, Jake Drum took her to a cave tomb where he suspects the bones of someone infamous were found.  <br /> <br />While in the tomb, she finds another hidden grave. Another murder, several disappearances, searched rooms, stolen bones, and car accidents complicate the case. Very unexpected results come back from the DNA testing, which bring up more questions than answers.  <br /> <br />(A non-fiction book is being written by Reichs' acquaintance, Dr. James Tabor, The Jesus Dynasty--due out in April 2006.) <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Reich has a great thriller here, with good historical background and present-day Middle Eastern atmosphere.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-29

The beautiful serene winter scene on the cover of French Creek belies the terror that awaits the reader inside. John L. Rule, Minneapolis salesman, understands the benefit of combining business with pleasure. He books client appointments near the Minnesota-South Dakota state line so he can finish the business day locating a steering wheel for his old pick-up truck. He was told French Creek is the place to go to get exactly what he needs. <br /> <br />He wasn't told it was also the place to go for the fight of his life. Although he thought the rude junkyard owner was a bit odd, Rule had no idea the owner had plans to make sure Rule and his Ford Explorer never left the junkyard. <br /> <br />Rennebohm knows how to keep a reader turning pages. I could see the characters, see the scenes, and hear the different voices he created.

My soon-to-be published friend Debra introduce me to The Observation Deck -- which I now lovingly call \\"a writing class in a box.\\" <br /> <br />This is not new, published in 1998, so I was late to join the fan club, and when I tell other friends about it, some look at me patiently and say: You just found it now! <br /> <br />The idea (should you choose to accept this mission) is to use the deck of get-off-your-duff cards to urge you out of writer's block. <br /> <br />This may sound melodramatic, but it has changed my life -- as a writer, editor, listener and observer of people, places and things. <br /> <br />When writer's block hits, pick from over 20 cards that might say: Take a walk; or zoom in and out; explore the underside; follow the scent.... You get the idea. My favorite is: EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER. <br /> <br />The purse-sized, 160-page book has a chapter on each of the \\"pushes\\" on the cards. My book is highlighted in yellow, with X in red and Q for wonderful quotes. I read a little, think a lot, and then an idea, or a new way to look at an idea that has been rumbling and grumbling around in my head pops into my thought process. <br /> <br />If you are wannabe writer (or better writer), this would be a great self-gift or for family or friends who are writers.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-29

It contains essential information for gardeners, both the experienced and the novice. Larson discusses how to grow and then cook fruits, vegetables, herbs and flowers. And it is fascinating! <br /> <br />I suggest, if you love apples, you try the Sticky Apple Coffeecake. If blueberries are your thing, you might want to cook up some Blueberry Banana Bread. One of my favorite vegetables is asparagus. The Asparagus with Cashews is quick, easy and so delicious. I admit to fixing the Creamy Cucumbers and snacking on them one afternoon.

Lucy Daniels' latest novel is a serious, perceptive work dealing with issues of race, alienation, and the conflicting, hidden emotions which sometimes warp a person's psychology and behaviour.    It is the story of Camilla Price, or \\"Lily,\\" a gifted, young black woman split between two worlds and haunted by the memories of her beloved, long dead white father. A result of an inter-racial union, Lily hopelessly searches for a real identity and a place to fit in.     The book begins in the present with Lily's first art show, her first \\"big break\\" at a prestigious gallery. However, soon enough things start going wrong. Her boyfriend Chauncey, a Scottish professor of architecture sixteen years her senior, often finds a way to make her feel \\"small\\" and inferior, wanting her to be famous to make up for the fact that she is black. This feeling of smallness is heightened by her own family--the black part of her family from her mother's side--especially by her Reverend Grandfather, whose only interest is to serve God and the church in extremely selfish, radical ways.     The story shifts back and forth in time to show Lily's childhood as she grew up with her religious family in Millboro, North Carolina, after the death of her father. When her musician father was alive, they lived a completely different life in California, full of laughs, music and freedom. Her life was thus tragically changed when she came to live with her mother's family, an event which had a profound effect on her character. As it is, Lily can't help feeling awkward with both white and black people. Her appearance--red hair, blue eyes, brown skin--heightens this awkwardness. In fact, her unusual looks turn her into an almost \\"comical\\" character.    Daniels has done an excellent job portraying Lily as a sympathetic, alluring, almost tragic character in her quest for independence and self-identity, beautifully exemplifying the pain and estrangement which people of inter-racial origins suffer.     Armchair Interviews says: Though there's not much plot, this novel's strength lies in its strong characterization. The author also offers some memorable lines and images, as well as insightful passages into the world of human psychology.	2005-09-27

Anyone born in the 1940-50 timeframe will feel like the photos and experiences are yours as you travel the day at grandmas with the little boy. But just because everyone is \\"dressed weird\\" in that era's clothing does not lessen the sentiment. The cover design of a tablecloth from that era is inviting and brings back memories of food and time around the family table. Then tablecloths were''t just for special dinners.    Cookies and other favorite foods, and doing special stuff together like staying up past midnight--all are mixed with the acceptance only a grandparent can give a child.    I was overjoyed to remember my own Grandma K, and saddened because my children were cheated out of such grandparent' love by Kurt and Evie's early trip to heaven.    Watch for more memories in upcoming But That's OK with Grandpa, available soon.

In Dreaming Your Way to Creative Freedom, writer and clinical psychologist Lucy Daniels offers the reader a glimpse into the strange, mysterious world of dreams and how these can affect the creative process and be used as a tool to cure writer's block. <br /> <br />This book is the result of the author's decades-long struggle with writer's block and how, with the help of dreams, she successfully overcame it. In Daniels' words, her two-mirror approach, which is outlined in the beginning of the book, \\"should pay off generously.\\" The aim of this process is to make the blocked writer realize that sometimes it's not the writing itself what blocks, but the negative feelings and emotional issues that writing represents. Having said this, dreams become revealing sources for those subconscious, deeply-buried \\"blocking\\" feelings and emotions. <br /> <br />In the first part of the book the author gives some background about the psychology of dreams, summarizing the main ideas of Sigmund Freud, Susan Deri, Lawrence Kubie, Donald Winnicott, Marion Milner, Gilbert Rose, and Morton Reiser, among others. <br /> <br />In \\"My Dream Journey,\\" which takes most of the book, Daniels shares a series of dreams she experienced from 1982 to 2004. Each dream is given a little background beforehand and an aftermath afterwards, so the reader may understand its significance. <br /> <br />The book ends with other artists' dreams and their \\"explanations.\\" <br /> <br />Though the ideas in this book are highly interesting, a person with no knowledge of the meaning of dreams won't be able to profit fully. What is obvious to a clinical psychologist about the interpretation of dreams may not be obvious for a regular person. How can a person be sure what their dream means? How can they be sure the interpretation isn't simply wishful thinking? What happens if dreams are erroneously interpreted? Unfortunately, Daniels offers no guidelines for this. <br /> <br />This is not an easy, \\"friendly\\" book about creativity like from Julia Cameron or Natalie Goldberg, but one that requires at least a basic knowledge or familiarity with psychology and the meaning of dreams.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

This book is another in the Rich Dad Poor Dad series. In it Kiyosaki explores what it takes to transition from employee to entrepreneur and from entrepreneur to business leader. He identifies and debunks the excuses people give for not acting on their dreams, He also identifies the roadblocks that people put in their own way by not thinking clearly about what it will really take to make an idea a profitable reality. <br /> <br />Among the vital lessons Kiyosaki wants us to learn are: <br /> <br />1. A successful entrepreneur finds the right idea, the right people to act on the idea, and the right money to leverage the whole project. <br /> <br />2. A successful entrepreneur operates from freedom and opportunity rather than security and resources. <br /> <br />3. The best time to answer the tough questions about starting a business -- is before you start the business -- not when you're in the middle of it. Some of these questions are: <br />a. How badly do I want my own business? Why? <br />b. How much will I extend myself to succeed? <br />c. Am I afraid to fail? If so, how can I make this a strength? <br />d. Am I willing to educate myself on the essential components of a successful business (defining and describing team, leadership, mission and understanding product, legal, systems, communications, and cash flow)? <br /> <br />4. Learn how to turn bad luck into good luck. <br /> <br />The book is filled with easy-to-understand, but sometimes hard-to-apply advice. But hard only in the sense that most of us do not like asking ourselves the hard questions -- and then acting on those answers. However, would-be entrepreneurs can accelerate their success by a thoughtful reading and application of this book and its principles. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews highly recommends Before You Quit Your Job  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />...  <br />	2005-09-27

This, the tenth book by David Yount, offers spiritual and practical insights about aging and retirement. When did this happen, this rushing headlong toward retirement? Yount's book says that every eight seconds an American reaches the age of 50 and American Baby Boomers will enter retirement years with 77 million others born after World War II. <br /> <br />The average man can now expect to live 27.5 years after 50; women will live 31.6 years. Most books for boomers are about extending life; planning financially; and preparing for decline and death. Yount talks about each, but with a positive Christian viewpoint. <br /> <br />Each chapter starts with a relevant Bible verse and another quote. In the \\"Time to be courageous\\" chapter, he focuses on Ephesians 4:23-24, \\"Be made new in the attitude of your mind ... put on the new self, created to be like God.\\" <br /> <br />Most of us wish for a clear mind and healthy body as we move to live comfortably in retirement. In the \\"For richer, for poorer\\" chapter, Yount prompts us with, \\"A feast is made for laughter, and wine make life merry, but money is the answer for everything.\\" -- Ecclesiastes 10:19. <br /> <br />The book has many statements about aging and stages of wellness. Reading and reflecting on Greg Anderson's \\"22 Laws of Wellness,\\" in the chapter on \\"In sickness and health,\\" is worth the price of the book. <br /> <br />Where does God and spirituality came into this book? In every chapter, reminding us that we are made in God's image -- and it's our job to take care of ourselves -- to reeducate ourselves to living life fully. Death does not hurt; life does, as the author wrote in his earlier book, Ten Thoughts to Take into Eternity. In the words of psychiatrist/author Scott Peck: ... \\"Ultimately we have to hand ourselves over to God.\\" <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Well-written, jam packed full of thought-provoking ideas that jab you in the ribs, hopefully to positive action. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

Author and illustrator, Shirley Hillard tells us simply and wonderfully in One Big Hug. Love is bigger than 2 bugs in a rug, 16 bears wearing a yellow coat, 27 chickens sitting on a goat, or even 100 penguins dancing on a cloud (you get the idea). It is enough when love is one big hug. <br /> <br />One Big Hug is a grandmother's expression of love for her grandson. What is so nice is that all grandmothers can substitute the child's name in the book for their own grandchild's name to personalize the story. <br /> <br />The illustrations are big, bold, colorful and whimsical. They are sure to delight the children and help draw them into the story which is really an expression of love. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Grandparents will want One Big Hug to read to their special ones.

In Breakers Reef, the fourth in the Cape Refuge series, the body of a well-liked teenage girl from Cape Refuge is discovered by Chief Cades' rookie officer, Scott Crown. The body has been staged to look like a murder described in the novel written by an eccentric mystery writer who recently moved to town. Clues planted by the murderer's accomplice lead the Cape Refuge police (and the reader!) to false conclusions. Soon after the first murder, there is another, this time discovered by the Chief himself. As law enforcement struggles to find solid evidence and sort the real clues, three people go missing. It's a race to find them before one of them ends up dead. <br /> <br />Life can't wait for the satisfactory conclusion of a murder investigation; Chief Cades' romance with Blair Owens progresses, Blair's sister Morgan is nearing the end of a high-risk pregnancy, Sheila Caruso is facing a set back in her faith, not to mention her hard-earned freedom--and there's a new troubled teen in town.  <br /> <br />The mystery is satisfying and complex enough to challenge the reader, but the real gems in this series are the characters, broken people who've struggled with demons and questioned God. They've faced their share of life's hard knocks but find healing and a second chance at Hanover House.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Returning to Cape Refuge in Breakers Reef is like going to Cabot Cove, Maine, with Jessica Fletcher. Only in Cape Refuge the characters find their redemption in Christ, not a middle-aged detective! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

In the foreword, Richard D. Lamm, former governor of Colorado, says, and I paraphrase here: The great earthshaking controversies in our history...have been initiated by people who were characterized as heretic for challenging the straight jacket of orthodoxy. New ideas come particularly hard in public policy. <br /> <br />On the inside over the author wrote, \\"We need a new basis for ethical behavior, lest we suffer the wrath of Mother Nature.\\" He takes on traditional environmental ethics like the balance between human activity and the environment. <br /> <br />Written before Hurricane Katrina and Rita, Elliot writes that our first ethical obligation should be to maintain the endurance and resistance of the Earth's ecosystem. Then, after the environment is secured, we need to turn our attention to human population. <br /> <br />This book has heavy, mind-boggling content that makes us realize we have only one Earth and each of us should be doing our part in saving it and its people. <br /> <br />Today the now-retired author, formerly a professor, lives simply and treads lightly on the earth. He wants us to do the same. <br /> <br />The Speaker's Corner Books is a provocative new series designed to get us to talk about public policy topics.

Vincent Lardo continues to write \\"in the style of\\" Lawrence Sanders who create the Archy McNally series. Archy McNally is a Palm Beach private investigator who works out of his wealthy father's law offices. <br /> <br />Archy and the Palm Beach A list are invited to the opening of La Maze. Newcomers to the Palm Beach scene, Matthew Hayes, former carnival cannon ball, and his wife Marlena Marvel, are throwing a party to get in with the \\"right crowd.\\" Hayes has recreated an English maze at his mansion and the party goers pair off to find their way to the center. But the contest begins only after Marlena recreates her famous impression of Venus DeMilo. But alas, most of the contestants grew increasingly frustrated and not only couldn't find the maze center, they couldn't get out. <br /> <br />Following the maze game, fabulous buffet tables awaited the guests. But the hostess couldn't be found. And then the search was on again -- and didn't end until she was found dead, at the center of the maze.  <br /> <br />How could she get there past all the contestants? Who killed her? When? Why? Matthew hired Archy on the spot to find answers. But as he digs in, there are only more questions. Then the most promising suspects, those with the best apparent motives, begin to die, and good leads turn to dead ends.  <br /> <br />The characters are believable and include those you'll love to love -- and those you'll love to hate. One caution, if you really care, be prepared to take notes and create diagrams to try to keep up with who is sleeping with who -- and who slept with who, but isn't any more. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Readers who like fast-paced easy reads will enjoy McNally's Bluff.

This is a \\"sequel\\" to He's Just Not That Into You. I have found that the message does not apply just to relationships but everything in life: Don't dwell on the past. It's over, and YOU need to get over it. <br /> <br />Greg is extremely funny and sarcastic in his answers to women who wrote to him. My favorite is a woman who is waiting for her married boyfriend to leave his wife. And she keeps waiting because \\"he's so good to my dog.\\"  <br /> <br />Greg states the obvious so clearly and so cleverly! It might be the exact advice a girlfriend (or even a mother) might have given, but you didn't listen. For some reason when Greg (or another man) tells you, you accept it. <br /> <br />The author explains that your man doesn't decide this morning he is going to break up with you this evening. No, he puts a lot of thinking into it, negotiating his options and slowly he starts cutting his ties to you. How they can get out of this relationship without you falling apart in front of him. So after he gives some inane and dishonest reasons for leaving you, he says: I'LL CALL. With those magic words, women sit and wait and hope he didn't mean to break up with you. <br /> <br />Women take their man's every word as truth, reading into them false hope. <br /> <br />After a breakup, Greg says not to see that man for 90 days. Don't think of reasons why he has to come to your house to pick up anything of his. Ever hear of donating clothes? Don't be brain dead. <br /> <br />I wish I had this book when I was going through a breakup so I would not have felt so alone. Greg explains how the \\"ah ha factor\\" is huge. I survived and you will too. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: We recommend this book to any single women and to married women who \\"are dating\\" -- if you are clueless as to what constitutes and leads up to a breakup, Greg will give you insights.

Author Bolen's 1999 book, The Millioneth Circle, generated a new way for women to become activists from within their own circles. This book continues that important work. <br /> <br />Several well-known women are quoted as saying, and I paraphrase here: If Jean says \\"Gather the women, I'll be there....\\" <br /> <br />MOTHER here is Mother Earth, who puts out a call for women to become strong women. <br /> <br />Dr. Bolen shows that when women worth together worldwide, we can shift from the path of domination and violence that threatens us to a better world, that we don't have our masculinity to prove. Women can be the savior of the Earth. <br /> <br />The concept of \\"gather the women\\" evokes all kinds of emotions. It is for women whose identity is not tied to their relationships with men--they have a strong sense of sisterhood. <br /> <br />Following on the well-fought, well-earned world of changing influences of the women's right to vote (suffragette movement) and the women's movement in the '60s, according to Dr. Bolen, is women preparing to move toward piece. <br /> <br />Peace, as the author explains, is both small and huge in scope: stopping violence in families, at schools, our streets and workplace to terrorism and war. <br /> <br />Her earlier Millioneth Circle concept is a metaphor for the circle that, added to the rest, brings about a critical mass that would bring about new ideas. <br /> <br />The book ends with a discussion guide and Circle Experiences as well as resources. Here chapters say it all: <br /> <br />- Mother's Day <br />- Mother Earth/Mother Goddess <br />- Monotheism/Doing Without Mother <br />- Mother's Day <br />- Mother Earth/Mother Goddess <br />- Monotheism/Doing Without Mother <br />- Mother Needs You! <br />- Antidote 1: The Visible Power of Women Together <br />- Antidote 2: The Invisible Power of Women's Circles <br />- Anything We Love Can Be Saved <br /> <br />When you read about what women have accomplished, you'll wonder what your role is, because we all have a role in saving Mother EARTH. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says this is a very personal book, asking women to get involved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

The author readily admits that although he was raised in a religious home and attended Bible training, he took another dating road for a while. Then a phrase came to him: Restore the glory back to the woman.\\" <br /> <br />His chapter titles really say it all, and his easy-to-understand thoughts can be implemented by anyone in a relationships or seeking \\"Mr. Right. Using Bible verses throughout to make a point, he especially references that the 31 Chapters of Proverbs (one for every day of the month) cover most things related to wisdom. He also breaks down in a most interesting way 1 Corinthians 13:4-8, \\"What Is Love\\" so often used at wedding. <br /> <br />Chapter 1: The Glory of the Woman: A woman's intuition is like a multiple choice test. She just has to select the right answer from the many options. He encouraged women to seek like-minded men to date. <br /> <br />Chapter 2: Who Do Men Cheat explores pornography's affect on men and relationships and how it promotes lying. \\"Thoughts provoke action,\\" the author says, and encourages women to both watch a man's deeds along with listening to his words as men can easily say, \\"I love you.\\" <br /> <br />Women find it harder to be dishonest about love because her emotions become her word. <br /> <br />Chapter 6: Do Feelings Dictate Love? The author says there is no such thing as \\"I'm not in the mood\\" with men -- and if you hear that, say hello to \\"Mr. Cheater.\\" <br /> <br />Some other strong statements are: <br /> <br />_ Your unfaithful spouse is brewing the coffee, and you need to wake up to it. <br /> <br />_ Forgiveness does not always require reconciliation <br /> <br />_ Feelings or emotions never accompany wisdom or good sense. <br /> <br />_ You always hear that \\"opposites attract,\\" but you have never heard for how long. <br /> <br />This book helps establish the criteria for a good mate. True wisdom, he says, is the wisdom understood with the heart, not just the mind. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: In AllMen Are Not Pigs, the author says that every woman's soul is alike, whether beautiful or plain -- and all deserve to be treated like they are beautiful in the eyes of the beholder.

In most devotionals we read the thoughts of others and incorporate them into our own life. In Jones' devotional we create our own daily devotional experience and incorporate them into our lives. <br /> <br />Through personal stories, scripture and exercises, Jones helps us kick-start our day by celebrating that \\"I waked up.\\" He uses this expression because every morning, his child always woke up and said, \\"I waked up.\\" He challenges us to think about how we wake up in the morning. What are our thoughts, feelings and actions? Further, he says, \\"we all wake up twice.\\" What he means is, our first wake up is physical and our second is our thoughts and feelings. And we all have the individual power to make a choice, (\\"a good waking\\") and we can rejoice in the fact that we can take sips of the powerful brew all day. <br /> <br />The process is B.R.E.W. (Being still, Receiving God's love, Embracing my personhood, and Welcoming the day.) Jones suggests we spend a few minutes of our daily devotionals around each of these elements and shows us how we can do this effectively. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Dr. Jones' B.R.E.W. is a wonderful way we can begin each day with a good wake-up and content rich experience with our God.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

In his preface, author Young states: \\"Parents, teachers, coaches, business supervisors, religious authorities, authors and critics of all sorts, inadvertently or not, have been responsible for dulling aspirations and destroying dreams.\\" Isn't that so true!  <br /> <br />From failure (and/or punishment) many of us are afraid to try again. For those who say, \\"I can't\\" without ever saying \\"I'll try,\\" -- this book's message will shake you into trying again. <br /> <br />Steve Young has collected over 60 personal stories of failure from entertainers, adventurers, medicine, politics, business, war, and so much more. A few are stories I've heard, most are new to me. Some writers are famous; others not. All have the message that failure is the \\"best thing\\" that ever could happen to them.  <br /> <br />Starting with Erin Brockovich, the authors range from Jane Goodall to Jamie Goldman, John Wooden, Bill Walton, Steve Allen, Ann Bancroft, Guy Gabaldon, Robert Townsend and Sam Donaldson and a whole of lot other interesting people in between. <br /> <br />The stories are all great. I had to read every word. This is NOT a book I'll pass along -- it will remain mine, but I will tell everyone about it. <br /> <br />I liked the one about Minnesota Viking's Jim Marshall who ran the wrong way and made a touchdown for the other team. He admitted his mistake, learned from it -- and in telling others, it allowed people everywhere to share mistakes they made and never told anyone about until they told Marshall.  <br /> <br />After the stories, the second best thing is the wonderful collection of quotes focusing on failure and success.  <br /> <br />The third great element is end-of-chapter quickies like Accidental Achievements (about things invented by accident), Unbelievable Understatement and Red-Letter Rejects (all about famous writers that were rejected again and again before someone finally published their work). <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: An amazing collection of \\"get-off-your-duff\\" stories to energize and support you to try again -- to rise from failure to success, or to look at your failures in a different light <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

Her husband, Scott tragically died in an accident, her friend has cancer, she's struggling to raise her teenage son alone (need we say more?), put food on the table and keep the roof over their heads. Keeping the roof over their heads is becoming increasingly difficult. Perennially Yours, Mibby's gardening business is losing clients left and right with the prolonged lack of rain.

He hoped that there might be, in his experiment, some lessons for human beings to learn about getting along with each other. <br /> <br />Masson ended up with seven animals: one puppy, one bunny, two rats, one kitten and two chicks. The animals were absorbed into the family and observed. Initially the results were mixed with the adjustment being the easiest on the rats. Soon the chickens began their exploration of the Masson home and contact with the author. As in life, there were accidents and scares. Hohepa, the rabbit suffered an injury that easily could have resulted in death -- and the rats disappeared one day. They were eventually found in the bathroom wall but Masson noted that while they seemed to enjoy human contact, they preferred the freedom to wander at will.  <br /> <br />As the experiment continued it was interesting to see what happened with the relationships between the animals -- and between the animals and the human beings in their lives. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Raising the Peaceable Kingdom is an extremely interesting, unique and entertaining look at the world of animals and how they behave. Most readers will ponder the results and wonder, what if?  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

Patrick Larkin does a wonderful job of writing \\"in the style of\\" Robert Ludlum who created the Covert-One Series as well as the more well-known Jason Bourne series. The Covert-One series focuses on Col. John Smith, MD, supposedly with a U. S. Army medical research group. But more often, he's detached to a small, top-secret group called Covert-One whose head, Fred Klein, reports only to the President of the United states, currently Sam Castilla. <br /> <br />Hardliners in Russia have slowly come back into positions of power, and the Russian president Viktor Dudarav (frequently referred to behind his back his back as Czar Viktor) believes that it is time for Russia to become a super power again. He rankles at the independence of oil and mineral rich countries like the Ukraine, Georgia, and others that once belonged to Mother Russia. Many of their citizens have ethnic roots in Russia. They must and will be reunited.  <br /> <br />He puts in place plans to have 20,000 innocents slaughtered in Kiev so he can send troops in to help stabilize the country. Hundreds of thousands of troops and thousands of tanks and planes are secretly maneuvered into position. And how can this happen under the eyes of the military strategists and intelligence planners of the world? Easily since now most are sick, dead, or dying. <br /> <br />Through an alliance with Konstantin Malkovic, a Serbian billionaire (now a U.S. citizen), and a renegade biological weapons scientist, German born Wulf Renke, Dudarev obtains a deadly Hydra virus. Each virus is tuned to the genetics of just one target -- and that target dies a violent, painful death within 72 hours of ingesting the virus. Colonel Smith and his colleagues, Fiona Devin and Oleg must take action or many will die. Will they be successful? Is it too late?  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: In The Moscow Vector, fast-paced action that takes place across eastern and Western Europe, as well as in Washington, DC, will keep the reader turningthe pages faster and faster. Does good triumph over evil -- yes, but only after many pay a huge price. Well written, strong plot and character development, and ultimately believable.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

I read the two books that are contained in this single volume when they were originally released. It was difficult waiting the 12-18 months between volumes. Each book is well-written, fast-paced, resolves things for the reader -- and then creates another dilemma which leaves the reader hanging -- until the next book hit the bookstores. <br /> <br />The Malloreon Epic Series is the sequel to the equally gripping trilogy, The Belgariad. Eddings creates a mythical world -- the kingdoms of the West and the Angaraks and populates it with noble people you will come to love -- and villains you will justly despise. Good is represented by Garion, farm boy turned warrior king, Belagarath, the 7,000 year old immortal sorcerer, and Belgarath's daughter, the Sorceress Polgara. <br /> <br />Garion becomes King of Riva after slaying the evil God Torak. You will admire his sense of justice and right and wrong as the series evolves. Garion and his wife, Queen CeNedra have an infant son who is kidnapped by Zandramas, the Child of Dark. If he cannot be rescued the boy will be used in a ritual that will make Dark Destiny supreme forever.  <br /> <br />In these final two volumes Garion and his companions must reach The Place Which is No More to rescue Garion's son and prevent the Dark Prophecy from being fulfilled. The Seeress of Kell is the only one who can reveal the location, but first Garion and Polgara must fulfill an ancient prophecy.  <br /> <br />And the more that Garion and his party learn and accomplish in order to defeat Zandramas, save the world, and rescue the Garion's son, the more they are at risk of having Zandrama's dark magic extract what the group has learned by entering the mind of one of them. <br /> <br />Once again Eddings has continues to spin story lines that keep you reading past the time when you'd promised yourself you would stop. And because the series is now complete you don't have to ration yourself because it will be a long wait for the next installment -- read on, the next and final installment is in the back of the volume. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves to see good triumph over evil and sacrifice justly rewarded.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: These are novels that won't disappoint you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

As a result of Kathe Copeland's daughter-in-law's terminal breast cancer, the compassionate children's story, Mama's Going to Heaven Soon, was born. It is a story that will help parents and other caregivers explain what is happening to their loved one. It also allows children to explore their feelings of confusion, fear and sadness and then be able to verbalize their concerns. The message is hope.  <br /> <br />The bold, bright and beautiful child-like artwork will contribute to drawing the children into the story. For parents there is a section that offers suggestions to assist them as they begin the task of talking about death. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Many families will benefit from this compassionate story. We highly recommend it. It also might be a welcomed gift for someone you know who is experiencing an impending death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

V.I. takes on the job and is drawn into the lives of her players.  <br /> <br />Josie Dorrado's mother Rose begs her for help as the factory where she works has been sabotaged. Frank Zamar, the factory owner, is angry with V.I., and refuses her help as he is obviously terrified of something.  <br /> <br />V.I.'s private life is also in turmoil. The man in her life, Morrell, an investigative reporter, is at home recovering from a serious gunshot wound; and Marcena Love, an attractive and gutsy colleague, is staying with him. Marcena is trying to come up with a story on South Chicago and uses V.I.'s work with the basketball team as a way to get to know people. She ends up getting very close to the player's fathers.  <br /> <br />The team needs a real coach, a new gym floor and equipment, so V.I. begins to search for corporate sponsors. She meets the grandson of the famous Bill Bysen, the head of a large conservative huge department store chain called By-Smart. Unlike his family, Billy is an idealist that can see how his family's business practices are harming the neighborhood. Billy brings the pastor of the South Chicago church where he is working to preach at the company headquarter's morning prayer meeting. This really antagonizes the family when the preacher lectures them on their responsibility to the poor and the community.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Paretsky has another hit here.

Archaeobiologist Michael Cohen and his former significant other, Dr. Alice Morgan-Wright begin a frantic investigation and search for cure that takes them all over the world as the virulent disease (leprosy) spreads. The disease is spread from lung to lung (breathing) and is resistant to all known cures. And a cure must be found or this new plague will continue to spread, infecting and killing everyone in its path. <br /> <br />Cohen and Morgan-Wright race against time but are followed by assailants whose job is to thwart their efforts.

Will a cure, if found, be in time to stop the spread of the disease? <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Reign of the Rat is a breathless race against time and an unseen enemy.

If you're in love with James Garner, you're probably around Jim's age bracket. If you love Emeril, you probably love cooking or at least eating. And just like in the movies or television, you get most involved with characters in books that are like you in some way--your age, your geographic location, your hobbies. Something about the protagonist connects with you.    James Scott Bell is an award-winning author, yet the first 78 pages of Glimpses of Paradise just didn't connect with me. It's a coming-of-age novel that looks at Zee Miller, the stereotypical rebellious daughter of a hellfire-and-brimstone preacher in 1916, and her main infatuation, Doyle Lawrence, the eldest son of a prominent lawyer who is expected to follow in his father's footsteps.    The characters in the beginning seemed cliche and starchy. It wasn't until I persevered through one-fifth of the book that the action and characters became a little more authentic and interesting.    After high school, Zee runs away to make it big on the stage and then begins a downward spiral both emotionally and morally. Doyle attends Princeton for a year, but then joins the military and is sent to the European theatre of war where he pairs up with a sweet country-bumpkin named Alvin. The book follows Zee and Doyle's lives -- through Zee's decisions to do whatever it takes to make it big and Doyle's post-war shock and despair. In the end, the two do meet again and the conclusion of the book isn't nearly as cliche as the beginning.     If you can persevere, the book is worth the read.	2005-09-27

Through personal stories, and personal reflection/group discussion questions, Judy Rushfeldt challenges readers to look at their unrealized dreams in terms of the self doubt or perhaps social conformity that have prevented them from fulfilling their passion. She refers to the outside influences that rob people of their dreams as \\"dream thieves.\\" Rushfeldt believes the price that is paid for conformity and not following passions is anger, resentment and a lack of motivation that impacts all areas of a person's life. <br /> <br />The author states that God has given everyone talents and every person is required to be faithful stewards of those talents. She encourages people to ignore their fear and provides the tools that will help them step out in faith and to follow their dreams. Because as Rushfeldt points out, God promises He will empower everyone to develop what He has given to everyone. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Making Your Dreams Your Destiny is a logical and practical manual to help not just women but everyone, zero in on their passion and translate them into God's purpose for their lives. The portion of the book that helps identify passions and setting goals is particularly helpful.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

He's written some powerful suspense thrillers in The Last Jihad and The Last Days and continues in that vein with The Ezekiel Option. The Ezekiel Option is different from his other novels because it is written with an overtly Christian perspective. <br /> <br />A Russian jet is hijacked and barreling in on Washington D.C. and the White House. President James \\"Mac\\" MacPherson reluctantly has it shot down. The Russian president believes the downing of the jet by the United States is an act of war and relations cool between the countries. Senior Advisor to the President, Jon Bennett and Erin McCoy, Senior Advisor to the President on loan from the CIA, are sent to the Kremlin to \\"smooth the ruffled feathers\\" of Russia. During a meeting, a coup takes place. Bennett is wounded and McCoy is taken hostage. The evil Yuri Gogolov takes over and begins to systemically blackmail many of the countries in the world. His actions place the United States and Israel as the world \\"bad guys.\\" <br /> <br />Gogolov presents a resolution in the United Nations calling for Israel to surrender all nuclear weapons or a nuclear war will result. Dr. Eliezer Mordechai, former head of Mossad and now a Christian, recognizes that the scriptures are coming true. He presents the Ezekiel Option, a 37-page brief, that foretells that the enemies of Israel will be eliminated by the supernatural. <br /> <br />Rosenberg writes a compelling, rapid-fire book that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first to the very last page. The Last Jihad and The Last Days were fascinating books that preceded actual historical events. But Rosenberg has risen to a new level in thrillers with The Ezekiel Option. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: The Ezekiel Option has the ability to scare the 'daylights' out of a person. It is a wild ride and worth the trip. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

In the Belgariad series we found Garion being raised by Aunt Pol (Polgara) on a farm until his destiny became clear. <br /> <br />In these first three books of the series, we are taken on a roller coaster as good battles evil while a child and a world's destiny are at stake. The group faces capture, battles demons, and confronts a fatal plague as they cross the foul swamps of Nyissa and journey through the inhospitable land of the Murgos. <br /> <br />Eddings creates characters that are at once noble and human. They rise to each challenge, yet on an everyday basis become short-tempered when faced with cold, hunger, dampness, etc. They will become the reader's friends -- and their enemies will become your enemies. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: This is an exciting journey with three books in one volume so you're not required to wait. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

Set in Florida, a state known for its beaches, it's fitting that Murderland makes for good beach reading.     Murderland opens with a familiar scenario of a father ruminating over the high cost of everything at the theme park, Empire Realm. He wants to enjoy the experience he shares with his wife and children, but he's concerned about money. The money quickly becomes a non-issue, however, when his daughter drops her ice cream, reaches down to pick it up, and stares into the face of a dead man.    Although we don't know much about the victims (yes, plural), we know a lot about Kevin Lonnegan, an alcoholic ex-cop. Hired by an old buddy who forgives Kevin his shortcomings, he has to work around the over zealous detective assigned to the murders, the ever-watchful work leader at the park, the single-mom-with-children love interest, the highly priced private security agent, and, of course, the serial killer.    Watching the horror experienced by tourists who find dead tourists thrilled the killer. But when the last body was found by park personnel before the tourists arrived, the killer got angry and Kevin became a marked man--marked for death.    I could see the action as clearly as if I was in a movie theatre and the characters were detailed and believable. If you want to enjoy your next visit to a theme park, don't read this book until after you get back home.	2005-09-20

And in the vast rubble of the lives that remain after its demise, there is a single question: can a friendship that is lost due to shattered trust, ever be salvaged? <br /> <br />Cameron and Sonia were inseparable from the moment they met at age fifteen. That sister-like friendship grew and thrived through their college years. But an act of betrayal and a confession destroyed their friendship in a matter of seconds. <br /> <br />Eight years after abandoning Sonia at a gas station, Cameron receives a letter from her. Sonia is about to be married and has been revisiting the past. That past includes Cameron and she attempts to broach their friendship with an invitation to her wedding. Cameron rejects that invitation outright. But Oliver, Cameron's elderly employer, makes a request of Cameron that will not be denied and may change the course of her life once again. <br /> <br />Friendship is a lot like love; some say it is a form of love. And The Myth of You & Me is a snapshot of two women who struggle to decide if we can ever really go home again to the people who have populated our past. <br /> <br />Stewart deftly weaves a story that poignantly touches on love, trust, friendship and loyalty. And she does it with expert precision; always giving us just enough information to keep us turning the pages because we care about the characters and want to know what is in Oliver's wedding gift to Sonia and what broke up the strong bond between the two women. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews highly recommends The Myth of You & Me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

The story is gritty and a bit edgier than the novels I usually read. But Rowe's masterful language skills gives us just enough before he pulls back and allows us a bit of rest before hitting us once again with the raw ugliness of the underworld.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews predicts that Rowe will be a force to reckon with in the world of the crime thriller and we can't wait to read the next installment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

Vanishing Act is the first in a series of five books about Jane Whitefield, an Indian guide who will take someone from where there are people who want to kill them -- to where they are safe. She provides people with a new identity and a new life. John Felker is looking for just that. He is a former cop turned accountant who is being set up as an embezzler. Someone is skimming money from the accounting firm's customers and depositing it into an account in John's name. There is also an open contract on his life, so he needs to disappear. <br /> <br />The book is written in two distinctly separate parts. The first part is about how Jane makes someone disappear. We follow Jane and John cross country as they are being chased by the men who are after John. We are introduced to people along the way who help make their escape possible by providing safe places to stay or creating fake documentation or getting them transportation. When Jane finally gets John safe, the story takes a new twist. The people we have met along their journey are being murdered. Someone has been tracking them and Jane fears for John's safety. She has to go back to save him before the killers find him too. <br /> <br />The Native American culture and history were very interesting. Jane uses her training and skills in tracking and in creating weapons from items she finds in the woods. I thought of a few questions along the way that I wanted answers to and was a bit disappointed when those answers, found late in the book, would have cleared everything up quite early. Surely Jane is better at this than I am and should have asked them herself. But then we wouldn't have had a story, right?  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Definitely pick Vanishing Act and up the next one in this unique series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

Steve Russo, author of Protecting Your Teen From Today's Witchcraft: A Parents Guide to Confronting Wicca and the Occult, writes a comprehensive manual for anyone, not just parents, who is concerned with the increase of witchcraft in society. <br /> <br />Russo says teenagers are searching for their own, not their parents' spiritual answers, and the danger teens face is that the occult and Wicca are \\"popping up everywhere.\\" Television programs, cartoons, movies, music, books and PC games are fraught with its influence so it is difficult to fight against because it seeps into all aspects of our personal lives. People begin to believe it is innocent fun. <br /> <br />Russo defines Wicca beliefs, discusses the reasons for its appeal and provides strategies to help protect teens. He describes dangerous activities, such as reading horoscopes, playing with an Ouija board, having your palm read, participating in a sance or visiting a psychic, as activities people participate in that crack open the door to darkness. Most importantly Russo gives the reader warning signs to recognize if someone is involved in Wicca and is practicing witchcraft. <br /> <br />The back of the book provides a wealth of information. There is a reference guide to compare witchcraft with Christianity, a glossary of Wicca/Witchcraft terms, holidays and symbols to better recognize a situation should it arise. Armchair Interviews suggests this is a must-have, must-read reference manual. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-18

Angela Benson, author of The Amen Sisters, tackles a seldom-acknowledged problem in the church -- that of the clergy taking sexual advantage of parishioners. And she does it with care and concern but also with a no-nonsense attitude. It's wrong and she says it's wrong. I like that about this author. <br /> <br />Toni confesses to her friend Francine Amen that she's had an affair with Bishop Payne for several months and is pregnant with his child. Francine doesn't believe Toni and responds in a harsh and judgmental manner. It seems exceptionally harsh when Francine tells her that the Bishop, who is married and has children, has accused Toni of chasing him. Following Francine's strong statements, Toni commits suicide. <br /> <br />Francine is devastated by the death of her friend. When Toni's brother accuses Francine of murdering Toni, Francine experiences an emotional breakdown. After several months of hospitalization, Francine decides to 'get her life in order' by returning home to Georgia. Francine left her home five years earlier and hasn't spoken to her sister Dawn Amen-Ray since then. <br /> <br />Dawn has invited Francine home but is uncomfortable since Sly, her husband of four years, used to date Francine. She's not sure how things will be with the two of them together again. And Dawn is especially concerned since her husband has committed his own sins.  <br /> <br />Francine returns home to learn some interesting things about Toni's brother George, the sins of other members of the clergy and herself. Perhaps if Francine is able to let go of her desire for vengeance and will listen to God, things just might work out. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Benson writes a powerful and compelling novel with characters you will either care deeply about or want to see fall fast and hard.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-18

In the 1950s my mother would take me with her while she shopped. Twice a month we would go to the variety store to buy fabric, kitchen supplies and other odd bits and pieces. While she shopped, I would head to a small but exciting corner of the store that housed a tiny bookstore of sorts. Eagerly I would search out the newest arrival of my favorite girl sleuth: Nancy Drew. It was a grand and exhilarating time for a young girl who dreamed of being a strong, smart young girl who solved exciting mysteries. <br /> <br />Nancy Drew is 75 years old and Melanie Rehak has written a comprehensive book on the most successful writing franchise ever. From what began as a kernel of an idea from the prolific Edward Stratemeyer (he also created the Bobbsey Twins and the Hardy Boys) we follow the beginnings of Nancy Drew and the creation of the author Carolyn Keene. Rehak takes us on an interesting journey of the two real-life women who authored the books, the cultural changes that required the books content to be edited over the years and other little known but fascinating items about Nancy Drew. <br /> <br />Millions of American girls have grown up on Nancy Drew. This book is the icing on the cake for Drew lovers who want to be in the know .... <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Girl Sleuth: Nancy Drew and the Women Who Created Her is a fun read that will add pleasure to the fond memories of Nancy Drew you had as a child.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-18

Fourteen-year-old Joel Dunn Jr. has been forced to take on the responsibility for his two younger brothers Tank and Carter when their mother abandoned the family, sister Angie ran away and Joel Sr. periodically \\"goes off.\\" <br /> <br />Hypersensitive, Joel Jr. is always alert to his father's \\"moods.\\" When Joel Sr. goes \\"off for the worst time\\" he hurts Carter. Fearing for his and Tank's safety, Joel Jr. loads Tank into the family truck and heads out to find his mother. Unable to wrest Carter from their father's grasp, Joel leaves him with Joel Sr., who is deep into what seems to be a psychotic break. <br /> <br />Joel Jr. and Tank's journey lead them to their sister Angie where Joel Jr. temporarily leaves Tank. Temporarily is the operative word as he returns to his responsibility: Tank. The boys eventually make their way home to face their reality, which is violence and the end of their fragile family. <br /> <br />While on their journey we hear and feel the soundtrack of soul music the children love, the one positive passed on to them from their father. Joel speaks literally and in his head in a direct manner, free of censorship and guided by experience and desire. <br /> <br />The story presents a clear view of conflict, abandonment, responsibility, determination and deep love for what it is you have, even if it is the last of your family. The grace that exists in the form of kind strangers who help the boys is the hope that keeps them and us placing one foot in front of the other.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says If You Want Me To Stay is a sometimes dark, literary novel-but worth the read for the message. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-18

She has a great job; she's pregnant with her first child and has a wonderful husband. Or does she? A routine medical visit indicates that Wendy has an STD! The only place she could have contracted it was from Mr. Wonderful! <br /> <br />Kim, Wendy's sister is unmarried with two children and a boyfriend. Grandmother Francine is a judgmental and bitter woman who complains about everything, especially Kim. Mother Marlene keeps everyone in balance, if that's possible in this family. <br /> <br />When Wendy separates from Kevin, her well-heeled husband, her family rallies around, supporting her however they can, as she negotiates pregnancy and then motherhood as a single woman. <br /> <br />Each family member has their own particular secrets that slowly come to light-and those secrets, the sharing or discovery of them, bring pain but also forgiveness, healing and humility. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Soul Matters is a compelling novel of family in search of God and each other. Yolonda Tonette Sanders doesn't duck the difficulties of the world. She faces issues straight on and brings the reader along for a good ride. You'll keep reading because you'll want to know what happens with each character, especially Wendy and Kevin. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-18

Her father died (well, she really doesn't miss him all that much), her mother died (now mom she misses), and since she'd been shot at almost a year ago, she awakes each day to incredible knee pain. What she really wants to do is die. Pills are the answer. The thing is, they knock her out, they just don't kill her. <br /> <br />Waking to a puma, who becomes a man and then a puma and then a man. You get the idea. Lois is literally in another world where she is claimed in a bridefight by the king's son Damon (who is first in line for the throne) and she must make a decision whether she will return to her world: earth. Complicating matters is Lois' intense attraction to her new husband Damon (who really doesn't seem to like wearing clothes). The king's other sons each find a woman they wish to \\"mate\\" with and then the king finds a woman. And what a woman! Lois has some thoughts and words about the woman in the king's life! <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says Really Unusual Bad Boys is a sizzling fast beach read with an interesting, unique and creative plot. My criticism is that Lois isn't particularly likeable as a heroine. She's just too harsh and vulgar and that detracted greatly from the read. I'd like to give another of MaryJanice Davidson's books a try to see if this was just an anomaly. <br /> <br />Note: Explicit sex and a lot of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-18

Few things are as bad as a telephone call in the middle of the night; especially if you've got a huge hangover. But work doesn't wait and police reporter Annie Seymour rushes to a crime scene where a beautiful and naked Yale student has taken a dive from a balcony. Seymour's newspaper doesn't really like covering things that might disparage the university, and the fact that the dead student doubled as an escort, complicates things. <br /> <br />Annie's nose is twitching. She smells a good story but it would be helpful if the incompetent newsroom \\"boob\\" Dick Whitfield wasn't shadowing her and if her boyfriend, Tom wasn't doing his job as a police detective by withholding information she needs to follow the story. Then there's the dreamy Frank Sinatra look-alike that seems to be stalking her.  <br /> <br />Annie negotiates the labyrinth of inconvenience and begins to uncover a corruption network that may even involve her own attorney mother. When another murder of a Yale student-turned-escort occurs, Annie knows no one is safe, not even her. This could be a story that costs her her job or even her life. <br /> <br />Annie Seymour is a bright, sassy and gutsy lady who likes to do things her way and without any interference from anyone, including boyfriend, boss, co-workers and mother. She has a good sense of purpose and uses snappy self-talk to work out in her head the stupidity of others. <br /> <br />Olson writes a good story with snappy patter and likeable characters. I'm looking forward to the next Annie Seymour outing. I suspect Olson is only going to mature as a writer.  <br /> <br />Arnchair Interviews says: Think Janet Evanovich, and you'll have some idea of Olson's style.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-18

Pat Dennis' \\"One For The Road\\" will make you think twice about wanting to buy cars, RVs or other motorized vehicles on a Sunday. Peggy Jaegly's \\"Wash Away My Sin\\" will make you wary of visiting old friends. You might want to cast a look around for a hidden camera. And in \\"Sweet Smell of Success,\\" Beverle Graves Myers gives new meaning to the phrase, \\"the wrath of a woman scorned.\\"  <br /> <br />The creativity of people committing crimes never fails to amaze me. I should think there will be a woman or two 'out there' who might have her 'creative side' kick into gear.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: There's a lot more mystery murder and mayhem served up in Who Died Here?

I don't know anyone who doesn't, at one time or another, think about or talk about 'the good old days.' It seems to be part of our nature, especially as we age, to recall bygone days with grand affection. It's another form of 'comfort food.' <br /> <br />Tell Me 'Bout the Good Old Days has almost two dozen stories celebrating and reminding us (and in some cases introducing us) about a time when life was less complicated and slower paced. It was a time that we want to believe we savored the 'here and now' and not the 'what is coming.'  <br /> <br />There was a 'catch' in my throat as I read the story about kite making (there were no kite kits back then). My heart skipped a beat reading about Fourth of July celebrations in the 'good old days.' It wasn't about fireworks; it was about patriotism we lived daily. Oh, how I long for that. My eyes misted reading about berry picking. That was something I did with Grandma Dockan. What fun we had 'working.' And I yearned for my father, long gone now. I can see his face, eyes crinkled with laughter when he and my mother put out cookies and milk for Santa. I always wanted to catch Santa. I never did. But I did hear reindeer hooves on the rooftop one year. <br /> <br />This spectacular book is made better by the paintings from Good Old Days Magazine. Artist John Slobodnik's paintings are magnificent. They draw you in and place you smack dab in the middle of the story. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Tell Me 'Bout the Good Old Days is one of the best gift books we've seen. The good times and even the tough times were tempered and made better with family, friends and faith. It is a book well worth reading and keeping. It is a book we need in these difficult times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-08

I love a good interviewer; one who asks good questions and then listens to their guest's answer. Brian Lamb, host of C-SPAN's Booknotes is all that and more.  <br /> <br />This Booknotes selection is subtitled \\"On American Character\\" -- which I misread as American characterS. The book begins with intros from Ann Coulter (on the right) and Michael Moore (on the left). See why I read it as \\"characters\\"? With 24/7/365 all news, all the time, we've become a nation of characters -- and sometimes it seems as if character itself is lacking. <br /> <br />Lamb has assembled 78 contemporary essays about people, places and things -- from stories about race and culture to war to politics to Mount Rushmore as well as the Coors, Goodyear and Carnegie families (for example). <br /> <br />The sections are: <br /> <br />- The Nation's Leaders <br />- Social Movement & Political Vision <br />- America at War <br />- American Inventors and Businessmen <br />- Our Cultural Heritage <br /> <br />When people today say, \\"We've never been more divided\\" (as witnessed by the closeness of our last election), his selected essays show that America has a long history of highly partisan politics, often bitter, sometimes even violent. <br /> <br />My favorite of the 78 essays was: \\"Philo T. Farnsworth: The Inventor of Television.\\" TV came into my home when I was a young teen, and I remember the excitement as if it was yesterday. My dad reveled in being one of the first to have one. I learned a lot of interesting things about the television, and how Farnsworth didn't get the credit he deserved. <br /> <br />Booknotes is a full course in diverse thinking, and a course well worth taking. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: So much to read ... so little time.

A thought pops into your head seemingly from nowhere and you wonder, \\"Could this be a thought from God or is my deceased father sending me a message?\\" You get goose bumps at the majesty of a sunset. A stranger appears with a message that profoundly changes how you think about a major life decision. Have you had a brush with God? <br /> <br />Mary Treacy O'Keefe validates your suspicions in, Thin Places: Where Faith is Affirmed and Hope Dwells, combining her personal and professional experiences coping with illness and death. Mary believes these thoughts, occurrences and feelings \\"from nowhere,\\" these \\"ah ha\\" moments, are real and in line with the way God communicates with us, \\"constantly sending messages of guidance, inspiration, comfort, love and hope.\\"  <br /> <br />These experiences are thin-place moments, \\"those times where we feel a sudden connection with God and signs of the divine become real.\\" They may come in a myriad of ways, an intuitive feeling, a healing touch, a coincidence or a ritual. These brief glimpses give us hope for something \\"wondrous\\" beyond earthly life. <br /> <br />Written first for her siblings, Thin Places is an intensely personal testimony of daily practicing one's faith. As such it is authentic, sacred and irrefutable. Reading Mary's account of events surrounding her parents' deaths (three months apart), memories will surface that you may now recognize as thin-place moments. You might even be empowered to believe your own experiences are real and relatable to others. Without a doubt you will be moved by Mary's \\"truth\\" told with love so achingly tender that one cannot help but want the same kind of grace, understanding and courage when faced with similar circumstances. <br /> <br />Mary's Catholic foundation and being Irish means the reader gets to experience both religion and cultural gems. However you do not have to be Catholic or Irish to gain great value and insight. <br /> <br />Mary is co-founder and executive director of Well Within, a non-profit holistic wellness center in West St. Paul, Minnesota, where she provides spiritual direction and workshops.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Slow down, listen to the voice within, actually see the world around you, and wait for Thin Place moments in your life.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-08

If you get your news from the talking (and cutesy) heads of most of today's news, this book is NOT for you. If you want to learn -- or be reminded of how our recent political history affects today, and the \\"why\\" of it, read How Mumbo Jumbo Conquered the World.  <br /> <br />As the Boston Globe said, \\"A very well-written rant against all the baloney that people seem increasingly to believe.\\" <br /> <br />Reading aloud at the dinner table, the content provoked some yes's, boos, laughter and table pounding from my husband and me. Author Francis Wheen covers it all in detail so even those of us who can't remember a historical fact from high school will get it.  <br /> <br />For example did you know what caused this to happen? <br /> <br />- 1973 the average American had 26.2 hours of 'leisure time' every week ... and by 1984 the figure had fallen to 16.6 hours -- almost 10 fewer hours a week. <br /> <br />The author explains in relative terms which President or world leader and their beliefs and policies caused what to happen at the time, and how it all fit together. Some facts shocked me at how often policies he described were \\"developed for the common man,\\" but actually benefited the rich. What's wrong with this picture? <br /> <br />No one, no party, no belief is left alone -- he bashes everyone equally. This book is for the cynic -- and fodder for an astute stand-up comic. <br /> <br />Here's my fist on the table. I'm outraged, indignant, baffled -- then on a new page, I'm laughing. So that's \\"history,\\" according to author Wheen. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Nothing is scared so get your drink of choice and flop into your own favorite armchair for a great read. You will be there a long time reading and reacting and wondering whether what you believe is true. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-08

Like most co-workers do when a collection is taken up for a baby shower, wedding, promotion or perhaps a birthday, Cassia Carr kicks in her obligatory five dollars and then goes back to what she was doing. But one collection Cassia donates to is different -- and she doesn't realize it. She's not contributing to just any cause; she's contributing to the lottery. And she and her colleagues win. Her portion of the windfall comes to just over $20 million. Not a bad day's work, you think?  <br /> <br />Problem is Cassia is a P.K. (preacher's kid) who speaks in scripture verses and doesn't believe in gambling. She is horrified to think that she has $20 million in ill-gotten gains -- so she decides to give it away. The problem is, it's more difficult than one would think to give large amounts of lottery gains away. <br /> <br />But wait! One man (in a trio of would-be suitors) is more than willing to relieve Cassia of those disgusting greenbacks. Adam, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, has recently returned from a ravaged land and that fact, and Cassia, is preventing him from getting on with his life. He's interested in Cassia but doesn't want her to know that he's also interested in her money and the story of her money.  <br /> <br />Adam has fallen away from his faith and just might find his way back if he opens his heart and listens to it and God. <br /> <br />For fans of the Whitney Chronicles there is a couple of interesting cameo appearances in Million Dollar Dilemma. <br /> <br />I so enjoy Judy Baer's 'chick-lit' Christian fiction. It's a fun romp through life that provides each of us with thought-provoking situations. I giggled my way through The Whitney Chronicles. In this book I started laughing on page 24 and didn't ever quit.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Million Dollar Dilemma is a million-dollar treasure you must read!

Set in Minneapolis, Duluth, Chicago, and the waters off the Apostle Islands, this mystery has its roots buried deep in the silt on the bottom of Lake Superior. What some suspect might be recovered from the Amador, a ship that went down in 1905, has monumental repercussions in the present day.  <br /> <br />The story begins when a researcher working at the Minnesota Historical Society discovers a 100-year-old letter discussing the Amador and its trip from Chicago to Duluth in 1905. To her surprise she realizes that it pertains to a friend's ancestors. She succumbs to temptation and makes a copy to show him, setting in motion events that will cause three murders.  <br /> <br />The same week, Mary Whitney and Michael Tanner are on vacation in the Midwest and sailing around the Apostle Islands with friends, when Mary discovers a brass plate with the word Amador on it. Mary and Michael are intrigued because the plate is far from the ship's last reported path. The wealthy Chicago deVole family had looked for the ship for several years after it went down, leading to speculation that it must have carried a valuable cargo. Had the deVoles been looking in the wrong place all along? What exactly was on the ship?  <br /> <br />Tanner and Whitney investigate, working with the Minneapolis and Duluth police after several related murders. Tanner's life is threatened and he is nearly killed when run off the road by a huge semi. Tanner interrogates the remaining descendents of the deVole and Mayhew families and discovers animosity and dissention, and many lies and half truths.  <br /> <br />You will enjoy this intellectual mystery that is as chilling as the waters of Lake Superior, and as enthralling as the sunlight sparkling on the waves.  <br /> <br />Brookins is a sailor and writer who lives in St. Paul with his wife.

Harry Sue's parents both went to prison, leaving her with next of kin, the horrible granny of nightmares. Now the father (a con) is dead, and the mother is a conette, serving time for drug dealing, and serving it without being in contact with her only child.    The story contains many different kinds of prisons: sadness and loss; actual incarceration; limits of being a quadriplegic; unmet expectations; and of course, not being loved and cared for.    Filled with prison 'joint jive,' at times I was confused by the words, but the rich characters and situations were well worth the struggle.     Harry Sue, age 11, is convinced the only way she will see ever mother again is to become a conette herself. She acts tough, but her soft heart gives her away at every turn. Her best friend, before and after a diving accident that left him a quadriplegic, form an alliance best described by the quote above. We should all be so lucky to have a friend like that.    The author is a journalist who has conducted writing workshops for women in prison who are separated from their children, imprisoned for their drug use. [...] The author tells us in promotional materials that between 1977 and 2001 the number of female prisoners in the U.S. grew 592%. Harry Sue gives voice to those children -- disenfranchised boys and girls grappling with the humiliation of having a parent in prison.    I am not sure what age this book is best for, perhaps age 12 and up. For any age, it WILL bring up questions    Armchair Interviews says: This would be a good book for a discussion group of young adults as it brings up the different aspects of being young (both good and bad). It is a thought-provoking andwell-written book with a message that will linger.	2005-09-08

Being a good parent is a difficult and often daunting task. It is a 24/7/365 job that requires much and is done without training. There are constant tensions that can unbalance the family or at the least, individual members. <br /> <br />In Walking the Parenting Tightrope: Raising Kids Without Losing Your Balance, author Russ Robinson negotiates the labyrinth of family life. He has adopted a business model called 'polarity management' and applies it to the job of parenting. He believes that in families there are tensions pulling/pushing at each other. Rather than choosing between sides he recommends 'going for' a balance between extremes. <br /> <br />Robinson describes the six common parenting issues as: <br /> <br />- The Training Challenge <br />- The Discipline Challenge <br />- The Spiritual Challenge <br />- The Adolescent Challenge <br />- The Financial Challenge <br />- The Interdependence Challenge <br /> <br />Robinson, through his and others personal stories, scripture, and small-group exercises, helps people navigate the tricky terrain of parenting. There are no easy answers given. But there is thoughtful advice and the encouragement to examine issues, share issues with others, and balance parental responses. Don't go for the extreme, as that what will fail. <br /> <br />Armchair Interview says: Robinson's book is interesting and enlightening. It is not however, a manual for decision making. Reality tells us that while we want someone to tell us what to do, each family is different and requires work in balancing tension. What works in one family, with a particular family may not work for others. Know that before you read the book and commit to doing the work. There is no quick fix in balancing family tension but Robinson's book is a good guide. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-08

Trudy's mother died when she was 12; and her brother when she was in high school. Her father has depended on her ever since.  <br /> <br />The book opens with a graphic, scary confrontation with a robber when Trudy is working alone in the store. Her initial terror gives way to a rage that the robber is preying on his own people.  <br /> <br />She decides to change her life. She is in a rut; same boyfriend for the past ten years and the same job. She begins working in a travel agency in exotic San Jose. She becomes friends with all her colleagues, except for travel representative Ann Oliver, also an African American. Ann treats Trudy rudely, criticizes her constantly, and only occasionally is friendly. Ann is someone Trudy envies.  <br /> <br />When Trudy is given the responsibility of purchasing supplies and paying the credit card bills, her co-workers suggest she use the company credit cards for her lunches and other expenses. That is the start of a fraudulent lifestyle. Eventually she expands to buying clothing, gifts for her friends, expensive trips, and she even takes on Ann's identity by applying for real credit cards in her name. Occasionally Trudy is bothered by her crimes, but the rush of buying spurs her on. Not completely self-centered, one of her favorite things to do is get money from the ATM and hand it out to the homeless.  <br /> <br />Unusual things begin to happen to Ann Oliver: she is beaten up, her sister dies: and then she gets threatening phone calls, and disappears. Trudy isn't worried as she has been making payments on her \\"Ann Oliver\\" bills. Just when she decides to end her dangerous charade, her life as \\"Ann Oliver\\" becomes downright hazardous.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Trudy and her co-workers and friends are drawn with a rich colorful brush; they are truly people you care about. The ugly and gritty reality of life in poorer inner cities is accurately portrayed as well.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

To further complicate matters, Bryant is engaged to marry Cydney, who he'd only known for three weeks. Kells doesn't understand their relationship or engagement but he understands Bryant.

Anneth is a 'wild child' who simply loves life and aims to party her way through it. Easter is the stable, deeply religious woman who doesn't hold with her sister's wild ways. The trouble is Easter is raising her younger sibling since their parents' deaths -- and it's definitely not an easy job. <br /> <br />Easter marries El and become pregnant. She loses her baby with the coal tattoo and her faith falters. Anneth marries several times, but it's Bradley who gives Anneth her greatest gift. It's the gift she shares with the woman who loves her most in the world, and with whom she experiences her greatest heartbreaks and tragedy, almost losing each other on the journey.  <br /> <br />Anneth and Easter choose different roads to travel but their land binds them together.

Rachel Marshall is divorced, living in England and is doing her very best to raise her precocious young daughter Grace by herself. She finds herself without much adult companionship and joins a spiritualist church (New Age) where she learns to work the Crystal Pendulum. When it is working, it will answer yes or no to the questions it is asked. <br /> <br />To support herself and Grace, Rachel works as an estate agent (realtor for Americans). Texan Jason Longbridge arrives in England and wants to look at properties. Rachel has soured on men but finds herself attracted to him. As she works with him to find a property, her attraction grows. The problem is that he is married. <br /> <br />Personally I'm not into New Age novels so I'll make that clear. But it does add an interesting aspect to the story. However, in this particular book I didn't find that it moved the story along very well. Mostly it seemed contrived, as did Rachel's illness (which kept Rachel and Jason in direct contact in order to develop the romance). The story had great possibility but there just didn't seem to be much sexual tension and I found my attention continually waning. I did like the twist at the end, however. <br /> <br />I think that West, who is British and resides in the UK, has potential as a novelist and shows good plot ideas that could be better developed. Then she would hit the mark. I'd like to see more of West's work as she matures as a writer. I think she could become really good.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

She finally lands her dream job, selling shoes in Macy's at the Mall of America. She lives in Apple Valley with her roommates Marc (a gay doctor) and the seriously wealthy Jessica. And... she's been dead for three months and is the Queen of the Vampires. Betsy has superhuman strength, and can't eat any more; she is disgusted by the idea of drinking blood, and falls asleep as soon as the sun comes up.  <br /> <br />In addition to trying to keep her job and find a new place to live (her old Apple Valley house has termites), she has to discover who is behind the murder of several good female vampires. Her vampire friends Eric Sinclair (annoyingly handsome and charismatic King of the Vampires), and his good friend Tina, help her discover who is manipulating the gang of enthusiastic teenaged vampire slayers. Betsy confronts the gang after they follow her home and she explains the good vampire/ bad vampire thing, and gets them on her side. <br /> <br />Jessica finds a wonderful mansion on Summit Avenue as her new place to live. Betsy discovers that another of her talents is that she can see and hear ghosts, and discovers a small child ghost, Marie, who haunts her new bedroom.

Everyone, at different times during their lives, will most likely experience a feeling of separation from God. But author Connie Cavanaugh believes that if we walk away from God, we'll never find the joy and peace we could have if we are honest with ourselves and listen to Him. Cavanaugh insists that if we do this, we will lose the wilderness wanderer that we've become and be filled with faith and God's grace. <br /> <br />Through personal stories (that we will all be able to relate to); an examination of the patterns that emerge in wanderers (people whose faith wavers); and the different ways we can reignite our faith, we learn that the journey back to God is often one where we 'fake it' until we make our way home. <br /> <br />Cavanaugh's discussion of surrender is an important wake-up call. Breaking the conspiracy of silence and taking off our masks is also a simple and logical way of making our way back to God.  <br /> <br />There is only one me and one you and we are each unique beings that are loved unconditionally by God. How's that for a comforting thought that offers security for eternity. We need to move on with trust; trust in a God who will never forsake us. <br /> <br />Cavanaugh's book is a wonderful read for those who are experiencing the wasteland of doubt.

The disturbance echoed against cold stone and hard wood; it multiplied into a dozen voices that tumbled down the aisles or rolled up the tower steps, dying as they nudged a bell into song. A deep tone, soft as an angel's voice, sighed from the tower and cajoled sympathetic ripples from neighboring bells. In the ringing chamber below, their ropes swayed as if pulled by invisible hands, the sallies dancing ghost-like in the dark.\\" (Now isn't that grand?)    The story is set in what seemed like an ancient English village. A dead body is found in St. Nicholas Church--on December 6, St. Nicholas Day.    These villagers really get into this St. Nicolas Day thing, baking bread for the poor and the elderly, wrapping gifts to give with the bread. This December 6, however the bread and gift distribution and church celebration were cancelled by the police.    My favorite line in the book is by the church's secretary, talking to Sgt. (Miss) Taylor, about the bad winter road conditions: \\"I always say, for all the fancy gadgets the police has these days, a car's a car. And you still can't drive on ice.\\"    One murder, one fire, and then more deaths and fires in this small town where there has been a lot of \\"inter-breeding\\" of lives, loves, fortunes and secrets.

This is a must-read book for anyone thinking about starting or expanding a business. Rather than simply another book about writing a business plan, Sutton makes the case early and often about why such a plan is needed - and it isn't always to raise money. <br /> <br />Sutton introduces the reader to Robert Kayosaki's Cashflow Quadrant. He points out that those in the E (employee) and S (self-employed) quadrants really focus on operating solo - and as a result have slim chances for building a business. Why? Because they are creating jobs for themselves for which there is no exit strategy. Those in the B (business) and I (investor) quadrants are team players and are always looking at how they remove themselves from the business situation - if and when they want to. <br /> <br />Sutton makes use of practical examples that help the reader understand the various aspects of writing the business plan - and why each part is critical. He emphasizes that it's okay - and perhaps preferable to get help on various parts of the plan - for example engineers can write and entire plan of 30-300 pages, but may find it difficult to boil it down to an effective one-page summary. <br /> <br />The book provides simple common-sense questions to answer that might be difficult for the would-be business plan writer to come up with alone. Questions like: Is the purpose of my business to make money and serve people - or to serve people and make money? The answer to this question is critical - and in the book he explains why. <br /> <br />He also provides simple, but powerful advice on the traditional SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats). He points out that many people struggle with this because they don't want to appear too full of themselves - or because they think that pointing out weaknesses dooms their chances for success and or funding. He powerfully points out that strengths should be common and compelling - that is the strength should exist in most all business of this type - but that you execute better than anyone else. He also helps the reader understand that weakness should be common rather than catastrophic. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: A must read for business owners.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

In the preverbal \\"blink of an eye,\\" our lives can change. What will we do? How will we handle the situation and life itself? <br /> <br />Robert Molsberry is the senior pastor of the United Church of Christ-Congregational in Grinnell, Iowa. In Blindsided by Grace he tells his story of learning to live with a life altering physical challenge: paraplegia.  <br /> <br />In 1997, Molsberry almost died following a hit and run accident where he was permanently left without the use of his legs. Molsberry, a pastor, husband, father and athlete had been bicycling on May 31 when he was hit by a truck from behind. Witnesses described the driver swerving as though hitting Molsberry was intentional. <br /> <br />Molsberry confronts and explores his disability from his perspective as the disabled person and as someone who responds to the people and situations he encounters around him. And he does this with insight and humor. <br /> <br />Blindsided by Grace is one man's thoughtful journey who's determined to live the life God gave him with as much grace as he can muster. His honesty is compelling. I found the poignancy overwhelming of his admission of what he would give up to be able to make love to his wife one more time. I laughed when he described a picture of him in the hospital. He was wearing a Groucho Marx glasses and nose and declared his family must have been bored. <br /> <br />As the mother of a child who has lived with blindness, I greatly appreciated Molsberry's account of his life before and following his accident. I so wish, as someone who has 'old eyes', that the print had been larger.

This is the story of the coastal town, Cape Perdido. The only \\"industry\\" is tourism, with the river, ocean and wildlife preserve nearby.  <br /> <br />Water rights specialist attorney, Fitch Collier, and community liaison specialist, Jessie Domingo, both with the Environmental Consultants Clearinghouse (ECC), fly in to help local environmental activists Joseph Openshaw and Bernina Tobin fight the huge foreign conglomerate that wants to pump water from the Perdido River and float it south to Los Angeles. The elderly local mill owner, Timothy McNear, has agreed to let them use his abandoned lumber mill and pier for their pumping station.  <br /> <br />The struggle is clouded by a mysterious death from the past and its repercussions. The influential head of the ECC comes to town, then mysteriously disappears after suggesting some dirty tactics to rout the water company, Aqueduct Systems, Inc., that involve using a private investigator to scrutinize the pasts of the men involved. He and Openshaw knew each other in college and have some major philosophical differences regarding ethical ways to fight environmental battles. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: This Cape Perdido is a wonderful detour by a top mystery writer. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

Sometimes it feels like there is no hope, and in our grief and despair we become angry. But, according to Richard W. Rouse, author of Fire of Grace, there is hope and in that hope lays reconciliation and forgiveness. <br /> <br />Rouse talks of forgiveness as a journey. He compares the stages of forgiveness to Kubler-Ross' stages in her book, On Death and Dying. They are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The steps are similar but not linear. The process is different for each person. <br /> <br />Through the personal story of the August 9, 1992 burning of his church, discussion questions, scripture reflection and prayer, we follow Rouse through the stages of forgiveness to the four steps of reconciliation, the restoration of relationships and the acceptance of God's Grace. <br /> <br />Fire of Grace is a thought provoking, insightful book that is easy to read and understand because of the author's ability to transfer his ideas with the help of his story of the burning of his church. This is a must read for everyone as we all need the healing power of forgiveness. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Read this book and give one to someone you know who is experiencing the need to forgive.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

Kate MacKenna is a positive person who always manages to come out on top, until lately, that is.  <br /> <br />Kate attends a reception for an artist at a friend's house and is nearly killed in an explosion. Soon after she learns her dead mother has used her fragrance company as collateral for a large loan ($300,000) that is coming due in a few short weeks. It appears Kate just might lose the company she has grown and nurtured. To top everything off, she and her best friend Jordan are threatened -- and best friend has a breast cancer health scare sending Kate to her bedside.  <br /> <br />Kate decides to face her problems in a more adult manner and to fight for and save her beloved business. Dylan, Jordan's brother, believes Kate's had some bad luck but changes his mind when he discovers there really are people out there who want Kate dead. But why? <br /> <br />There are twists and turns and suspense galore in Slow Burn. I was a bit overwhelmed with all the staggering problems Kate experienced at once. But the story is fascinating and I kept turning the pages, torn between wanting to finish the book yet wanting the excitement to continue. <br /> <br />I just have to share one funny item in the book. Garwood writes, 'Roger Mackenna came armed with a .45 to the reading of the will. He arrived at the prestigious law firm of Smith and Wesson....'

The combination appears to be appealing, yet it falls short. <br /> <br />The mystery/romance has become an increasingly popular format for contemporary writers. Ramsey's mystery plot has the potential for intrigue. Spiegel, the central character, is an attorney who has been summoned to help Breanna Felix, daughter of a congressman. Breanna's lover Sean was found dead on a beach in Bermuda. The premise is to find the true killer and exonerate Breanna. The revelations do little to build to the climax, which really is the old deus ex machina utilized by so many playwrights when the story just won't work. It was disappointing.  <br /> <br />Spiegel and her lovers were really the major focus of the book. Jumping from bed to bed while being concerned with her \\"biological clock,\\" she seemed to be really unsure of what her major goal in life was. As a successful lawyer, her knowledge was sought by the Felix family -- a wonderful role model for any young woman. However, her childlessness hung over her success. It was difficult to ascertain exactly what Spiegel was after. Her continual return to James, her married lover with both wife and children, showed her as weak rather than independent. The motivation for that was unclear. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most glaring weakness of the book was toward the end when Spiegel is diagnosed with leukemia. \\"Good grief!\\" was the reaction. This and her sister's accident could have easily been omitted to aid to the economy of the plot. Perhaps Ramsey was attempting to add the human interest, which always seems to be lacking in a romance-mystery. <br /> <br />For a \\"first try,\\" this is a fairly good book. However, Ramsey needs to draw the reader into the mystery and loosen up on the romance angle. Even though a romance/mystery, a book should use the solid intrigue of a mystery -- the clues, the discoveries along the way. It might be tempting to look at Ms. Ramsey's second book and see if she matures as a writer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

You will not read about exercise and how many hours per week you should work out. It does not discuss food (those that are good for you and those that keep the scale rising). It doesn't even look at dietary supplements and proclaim them as a marvelous tool to help in the process of losing weight. <br /> <br />What The Subconscious Diet does is look at what it takes, day-by-day and over the long term to change thinking patterns and habits that prevent people from losing weight and keeping it off. Sanders wants dieters to establish a goal and then follow the mental processes in his book to help us follow through on that goal. He believes that if we follow the easy steps he's laid out, everyone will be able to 'push through' and achieve their goal of weight loss. <br /> <br />I found it particularly handy that each chapter ended with a point-by-point \\"Things to be Remembered.\\" Much of the information is things we all know, but it's a handy reference and reminder during the process. <br /> <br />Armchair Interview says: The Subconscious Diet may just help you change your thinking and lose those unwanted pounds <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

She will keep you enthralled as you fight between the desire to quickly finish Norma Ever After so you know what happens -- or to slow down so you're able to savor her wonderful word pictures. <br /> <br />Norma is like a lot of girls who, growing up, just don't seem to fit in anywhere. They might be gawky, unsure of themselves, or just different in some way that doesn't 'fit in' with the 'group.' Yet, like those girls and all others, Norma dreamed dreams and yearned for the passions of her heart, only to be disappointed when fate steps in every time and 'screws' it up. <br /> <br />When Norma's father dies, he gives her a sea chest filled with cash and an old, beloved stuffed animal: a puffin she had when she was a little girl. She takes the bird as a sign and travels to what she thought was a mythical place her dad made up stories about: the Orkney Islands. There she discovers that puffins are real, women who don't fit in, can, handsome men are in abundance (and they like her) and fate can take a vacation (perhaps permanently), if you really believe in happily ever after. <br /> <br />I laughed, I cried, I rooted for Norma, Brian, Colin, and even Fiona. But I didn't root for a man named Trey, who I want to believe got what he deserved in the end. Fate, you know. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Norma Ever After by Nancy Baxter is simply delicious.

Newton, is a fascinating collection of nine short stories. Each story is written in the unique style and voice of a different author.  <br /> <br />I so enjoyed \\"A Life Interrupted\\" by Diane J. Newton but wanted it to have a more fully developed ending. We were given the luxury of getting to know the characters and then there seemed to be an abrupt and neat ending. Newton carefully developed the characters. They were full, rich and dimensional. I disliked the father and really disliked the sister Jenny. I rooted for Laura and Mike and felt intense pity for mom Samantha. It was an interesting story that drew me in and held me in its darkness. <br /> <br />\\"Josie\\" by Kathleen Strelow will tug at your heart and most people will, at the least, have tears threatening to spill. It's really the most different of the stories included in the collection and fits because there is the requisite secret. <br /> <br />\\"A Matter of Taste\\" by Cathy Clamp is the story I latched onto and didn't want to let go, not unlike Dan Magraw who really wanted a vacation but the death of Ricky Redding and the arrest of his girlfriend Mandy tugged at him, demanding answers. Mandy proclaimed her responsibility for Ricky's death, but did that mean she murdered him? <br /> <br />\\"Not There\\" by A.P. Fuchs will have you on the edge of your seat and you'll find yourself returning to it long after you finish reading it. And you'll ask yourself repeatedly, was Terrance insanely jealous or crazy or perhaps both? <br /> <br />The other five stories will all grab your attention and take you for a grand and unique ride.  <br /> <br />An interesting aspect of this collection is the contest attached to it. The question is: Are the stories based on fact or are they nothing more than a bit of fiction. If the reader guesses correctly they can win a signed copy of another book by each of the authors (nine books) plus a free copy of Secrets II.

Fear of speaking in front of a group is the third greatest fear of Americans, according to the book of lists -- preceded only by death by fire and death by drowning! Yet in business we are often judged, albeit unfairly, by our ability to present. <br /> <br />Wiskup knows this and does a fine job of helping the reader understand where this fear originates. By understanding the particular hot button that causes your fear to rise up within you and choke your ability to present in a powerful and persuasive way, you begin to understand how to eliminate that fear. <br /> <br />He helps the reader understand the importance of the PSB (Power Sound Bite) to make each presentation memorable. He illustrates the power of these using both classical (\\"to be and not to be? That is the question!\\" and \\"Let them eat cake!\\") And contemporary (\\"You like me, you really like me!,\\" \\"The tribe has spoken,\\" and \\"You're fired!\\") examples. <br /> <br />Wiskup also correctly identifies a longtime trend in speaking that needs to be in every presenter's tool kit -- the art of storytelling. It is the key to moving a good presentation to a great presentation. Stories can bring out facts and figures, that presented alone, will never move an audience to life in a way that compels action. <br /> <br />Wiskup also identifies six deadly ways to open a presentation -- that are probably used in 90% of all your presentations -- but you'll have to buy the book to learn what they are and how to avoid them! <br /> <br />I found this to be a practical useful book that will stay on my bookshelf.

In this book the authors suggest and demonstrate that work culture has a lot to do with productivity and profits. They argue that the average worker wants to care about the work they do and to believe that it counts for something more than a pay check. But there are barriers. Not insurmountable barriers, but barriers nonetheless. <br /> <br />Creating A Culture of Success serves as a road map through the mine fields that keep an organization from going from where it is -- to where it wants to be. And this requires the creation of a way of life, rather than a program or series of programs. <br /> <br />The authors' recipe for success: the four Cs -- Change, Competition, Cooperation, and Control. The organization must move from us versus them as an internal competition to we versus they as the organization versus external competition. Creating A Culture of Success provides a variety of specific recommendations for how to do this. One specific example: managers need to move from watchdogs to coaches. To quote the authors: <br /> <br />\\"It is not work that tires people out -- it is frustration. And frustration is generally introduced by the boss, the systems, policies, or the work environment. The key to eliminating frustration is to focus the work group on one agenda. <br /> <br />1. Each individual has to be willing to check their personal agenda at the door every day. <br />2. Each person needs to know exactly what the agenda is for each day. <br />3. Each person is encouraged to participate in deciding how the work will be divided and accomplished. <br />4. Complimentary words between workers and leaders throughout the day help immensely.\\" <br /> <br />The book is filled with practical examples and \\"how tos.\\" I highly recommend it.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! is a 2003 Caldecott Honor book and it is brilliant! The pigeon is memorable because of its huge eyes that emit emotions and personality that flood the page. The emotions go from hopeful to full of rage and everything in between. And although the illustrations are simple, that only adds to its perfection. The dialog is minimal and that adds to its brilliance. It begs children to become interactive with the story. Children will love this book, and it will become a long-time favorite.<br /><br />A little pigeon does everything possible, through begging, bribing, wheedling, pleading, conniving, rationalizing (you get the picture), to drive the bus. Nothing seems to work; not even the declaration of \\"I have dreams, you know!\\" The end is wonderful and so clever. I laughed out loud reading this book, and I can't say many children's books have brought me to that state.<br /><br />This is a book that will stay on my bookshelf always.

The eyewitness is a middle-aged nun who uses hypnotherapy to cure the terrible nightmares she's had most of her life. During the therapy, horrifying details of a brutal stabbing she witnessed as a small child emerge, and J.P. must find out if there is an unsolved crime that fits her description. Once they figure out who the victim and murderers were, the nun decides to confront the one killer left alive. <br /> <br />But two more deaths occur--one possible accidental, the killer who falls down some stairs; and the other a possible suicide--the original investigating officer who now lives in a nursing home. There is definite proof of bribes to both the investigating officer and to the nun's parents, who made sure she was never questioned, and who moved away a few days after the murder. <br /> <br />Complicating this assignment is the murder of a woman in Tacoma--who happens to be the ex wife of J.P.'s best friend Ron Peters. A former drug user but newly \\"clean,\\" she wanted custody of her teenaged daughter. Ron is a policeman and a suspect. J.P.'s department must handle the investigation.

What Hawke doesn't realize is that his intervention will also enable him to solve and avenge the senseless church step murder of someone he loves. <br /> <br />Bell is a compelling writer. He moves the plot along but provides sufficient character development for you to really connect on an emotional level with both the heroes and villains. For those that have traveled, his descriptions of the various locales let you know that he's been there -- or done his homework. For those that have not, his descriptions make you want to call your travel agent and book the next flight. <br /> <br />In the end it becomes clear that evil is clearly evil -- and good is clearly good.

But Trueblood isn't completely lost; he has a nine-year-old daughter, Robin that he loves deeply and is raising alone since his wife died.<br /><br />When Trueblood is hired by an eccentric woman, Meg, to communicate with the ghosts of Rosewood, a new bed-and-breakfast located in an historic old house, things change. Meg brings the shaman to Rosewood and ultimately to Rochelle LeClair. Rochelle and Trueblood have met in the past and while she believes him to be a fake, she's drawn to him, as he is to her. Their journey begins as secrets of the past and the heart come to light.

It's 1963 and after numerous Sunday altar calls, 13-year-old Layla Jay decides it is time to seek salvation. Never mind that she was pretending to be \\"saved\\" and that she feels a certain amount of guilt. Layla Jay wanted to make her grandmother happy, get noticed by a boy and besides, she had been dramatically playing out the scene for a long time. And it played just like a movie. <br /> <br />Religion becomes more interesting to Layla Jay when a handsome preacher comes to stay at her family's home. Wallace gives Layla Jay his attention until the beautiful Frieda (Layla Jay's mother) waltzes back home. Wallace and Frieda marry and for a brief moment Layla Jay believes she'll have the father she lost to death at age two. She soon learns that Wallace is not as he seems and her mother's childish and reckless behavior places Layla Jay and herself at risk. During this troublesome time, Layla Jay has to deal with her best friend's betrayal and a boy who can't seem to make a decision about who he loves. Ultimately it is an act of love and sacrifice to protect her daughter that places Frieda at risk. It is a lie told by Layla Jay that just might keep her life and that of her mother's from disintegrating. <br /> <br />I love Bev Marshall's ability to tell intriguing stories. She mixes a bit of humor with a whole lot of tragedy. She also introduces us to humanity in the form of her rich and complex characters that you hate to say good-bye to when the last page has been read. I can't wait to see what she writes next. And you'd better believe I'll be waiting for its release. And none too patiently I might add. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: You'll also enjoy Walking Through Shadows and Right as Rain. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-01

Susan Carroll is the author of Bride Finder, Night Drifter and Winterbourne. The Courtesan is the second in a trilogy; the first is The Dark Queen. The trilogy is set in France in the late 1500s. <br /> <br />The Courtesan is Gabrielle Cheney's story. Gabrielle is the middle of three sisters with extraordinary abilities. The sisters are \\"daughters of the earth,\\" with special talents. Ariane, the eldest sister, is a healer. Miri, the youngest, can communicate with animals. Gabrielle's talent is the art of creating beauty\\"usually with painting. <br /> <br />Gabrielle moved to Paris, in 1575. She has given up painting, feels worthless, and has decided to make a career of being a courtesan; she can make herself beautiful and she is ambitious. <br /> <br />She has set her sights on Henry, the Huguenot King of Navarre who is the son-in-law of Catherine de Medici. However Gabrielle has never gotten over her attraction to the knight, Captain Nicholas Remy. She thought Remy was dead, but he returns to complicate her life and plans since Remy is pledged to serve Henry of Navarre. Remy is determined to get Henry out of the clutches of his evil mother-in-law, and back to Navarre. <br /> <br />Remy is renowned on the battlefield, but is tortured by his memories of battles and all those he has killed. Remy discovers Gabrielle's secret shame, that she was raped by a man she liked and trusted. This event has contributed to her becoming a courtesan. <br /> <br />The story has a great deal of intrigue as we follow Gabrielle and Remy. There are other daughters of the earth, or witches, including the Queen, Catherine de Medici, and Cassandra, a blind necromancer, who are out to destroy Gabrielle and her sisters. Witch hunters manipulated by the Queen, evil plots set in motion by Cassandra, a book filled with ancient dark magic spells loose in France, and suspected betrayals and misunderstandings all complicate the story. <br /> <br />The Courtesan is filled with strong female characters and the magic is just magical enough. The relationship between Gabrielle and Remy is fraught with exactly enough honor and duty and sacrifice to make it really romantic. This is a great love story to read on the beach or in front of a crackling fireplace. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says this is a wonderful read that will have you buying the first book and watching for the final installment in the trilogy. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-26

You know the one; she wiped tears from our eyes and occasionally her own. And she always listened to us happily chatter about life or empathized with us when we were troubled. She was the one who stayed up waiting patiently for us to come home safely before she closed her eyes for the night. Then there were the times that that special woman patiently taught us what needed teaching; like loving God and others. That special woman in our lives may be our mothers, or perhaps it's a grandmother, aunt or some other special woman who unselfishly stepped in to help shape our lives. <br /> <br />Kathryn Andrews Fincher pays homage to these special women in Mama Knows Best. It is beautifully illustrated by the author with pictures that will warm your heart and perhaps even shake loose a memory or two. <br /> <br />Some of the verses are written by the author, but the pages are also filled with the poignant and thoughtful words of others, people like Rose Kennedy, Maria Montessori, Alex Haley, George Eliot as well as nursery rhymes and Bible verses. <br /> <br />One of my favorite verses (author unknown) in the book is: \\"A mother is someone who dreams great dreams for you, but then she lets you chase the dreams you have for yourself and loves you just the same.\\" How beautiful is that?  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Mama Knows Best is a beautiful gift for the woman or women in your life that you wish to honor and show your appreciation for all they've done for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-26

Lisa Tillman's experience as a television writer and producer (for Fox, Court TV and The History Channel) has contributed a great deal to her book, especially in the humorous portrayals of the bosses and some of her rival reporters at her fictional television show.  <br /> <br />Abigail (Abby) Gardner has a fast, exciting, travel-filled life as a television reporter for the fictional almost-tabloid television show, \\"The Journal,\\" investigating everything from medical manufacturing malpractice to babes in bikinis (not her favorite type of story). Abby and her feckless and rootless older brother Bennett were raised mostly by her father, known as \\"the Doctor,\\" after her mother died in a particularly gruesome car accident with a young Bennett in the car. The Doctor has a hard time showing emotions, and is closest to his dog, Maggie. He suffers a stroke early in the book, throwing Abby's life into chaos.  <br /> <br />In the hospital Abby meets Bennett's \\"new\\" girlfriend, Emily Boyle, who he has been seeing for months. Emily is the wild child, black sheep embarrassment to the Boyles, a grand political family beloved by the nation but haunted by tragedy. Just as the Doctor seems to be on the mend, Bennett is arrested for murder after he returns home to find Emily, apparently beaten to death in his bed. Suddenly Abby and her family are the focus of incredibly intense media scrutiny. A tabloid newspaper gets photos of the Doctor in the hospital, so Abby takes a leave from her job and cares for him at home, with the help of nurses and round-the-clock security.  <br /> <br />Abby also finds Bennett a great attorney, and then helps with the investigation. There are twists, strange claims from Emily's best friend; a sudden fiance of Emily's who makes a revealing TV interview; and nasty comments from Emily's brother, Thomas Boyle, who has great political aspirations. In the midst of all this Abby has to try and find out the truth.  <br /> <br />The characters are great, and we hope this will become a series. The story is gripping and the setting realistic. Hard to put down.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-26

The book begins when the White House is overtaken by Arab terrorists led by Rafique Aziz.  <br /> <br />The President escapes safely to his underground bunker, but many innocent bystanders are killed and hostages taken. With the President incommunicado, locked in the underground bunker, the weak-willed, yet power-hungry Vice President is put in charge.  <br /> <br />The Pentagon and CIA have no choice but to put top counterterrorism operative, Mitch Rapp, on assignment to make his way into the White House to free the President and the hostages before Aziz can carry out his plan. In a race against time, Rapp sneaks into the bowels of Executive Mansion and uses the secret passages and corridors of the White House to get around without the terrorists finding him. Rapp soon discovers the President is not as safe as Washington's power elite had thought. He scrambles to free the President and hostages before the terrorists can extract the president from the safety of the bunker. <br /> <br />I love Vince Flynn's books. He is fun to read because he keeps you interested by ending a chapter in a way you'll want to go on to the next one to find out what happens. He has a way of writing about Washington to make you think it's really going on. I found myself a couple of times watching the evening news waiting to hear about the \\"White House\\" takeover, but in the next split second realized that was in the book I was reading.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says that Flynn's series of best-selling thrillers are a must-read if you love to get realistic goosebumps from every page. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-26

Nina Pryce and Phil Broker and their daughter, Kit, retreat to the northern reaches of Minnesota to help Nina recover from injuries received on her latest mission. Nina damaged her shoulder and the realization is dawning that she will have to quit the military work she loves so much. <br /> <br />As Nina plunges into a deep depression, Phil is left to care for her, raise Kit, deal with the school, housework-and in his free time, help out friend Harry Griffin with his landscape business. Harry and Phil go way back to their days in the military. Phil and his family are staying in a remote lake house that Griffin owns. The hope is that the isolated spot will help Nina heal. <br /> <br />Kit begins having problems with the school bully, Teddy Klumpe, and ends up punching Teddy in the nose, humiliating him. His parents react with unreasonable anger and Phil doesn't help the situation when he violently confronts Teddy's father at the school. It seems Phil and his family have made some terrifying enemies. Teddy's mother, Cassie, is strange and violent, and is not beyond reaching out to her brother, ex-con Gator Bodine for help. Gator, who has some dangerous connections, discovers Phil's past as an undercover cop. <br /> <br />Homefront is non-stop nail-biting suspense, filled with evil villains, and a sense of atmosphere (the cold and dark north woods filled with howling wolves, and abandoned farms used as meth labs). <br /> <br />This is the seventh in the Nina Pryce/Phil Broker series. Logan is known for his strong female characters, accurate portrayal of police procedure (even though his main character is retired from the police, he still has dealings with them), and his strong sense of place. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Don't read this on a dark, dreary, cold winter night alone in an isolated northern Minnesota cabin. You'll scare yourself to death! Logan has done it again! Homefront is a superb page-turner. <br />	2005-08-26

It's not SAMs, Sidewinders, or anything else we've read about in the newspapers. It's the lowly torpedo. With a top speed of 50 miles per hour, it is slow by the standards of all other weapons--yet no one has ever developed a defense against it. But they'd better. <br /> <br />Germany, an ally of the U.S., is in trouble. A problem with one of their nuclear plants, a weak economy, and other mistakes have caused them to make a secret deal to sell four state-of-the-art diesel submarines (yes, diesels can be state-of-the-art!) loaded with missiles to the Middle Eastern nation of Siraj. The despot ruler of Siraj makes Saddam Hussein look like a schoolboy, and he's prepared to do anything to advance his greed and support terrorists. Germany's chancellor doesn't care as he has no political future unless he can make this deal, despite opposition from NATO.  <br /> <br />But the U.S. has another problem. Germany's action has been calculated to build its esteem as an arms' supplier and the military power in the Mediterranean and Arabian Gulf, while at the same time causing the U.S. to lose face. So the U.S. must neutralize the threat using the fewest assets possible. That means four destroyers and an aircraft carrier. The only problem is--Germany has been trained in the same NATO submarine warfare and counter warfare procedures as the U.S. And they're not operating by the book. <br /> <br />One destroyer is quickly disabled and the aircraft carrier is put out of commission. And the American President insists that the subs must be stopped at all costs--but with only the three destroyers left. So Commander Samuel Harlan Bowie (better known as Jim), captain of the guided missile destroyer U.S.S. Towers, must come up with a way to make the Germans believe he's following the old rules--while making up new ones.  <br /> <br />A little too much time is spent in the political maneuvering, but it does enable the readerto feel the conflict between political necessities and military reality that often pays the price. <br /> <br />The realism in Edwards' writing is phenomenal and the word pictures he paints put you right in the middle of the action. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-26

There is no doubt that we are blessed with many talented mystery writers. There are, however, only a handful of books each year that are exceptional. Ellen Hart's The Iron Girl is one of those. I've read many of Hart's novels and while they are all well written, compelling and interesting stories, The Iron Girl is spectacular. <br /> <br />The death of Jane Lawless' life partner Christine Kane many years ago did not put closure on their relationship. With a new relationship beginning, Jane realizes she must move on. She begins the sad and disturbing job of going through the boxes of Christine's belongings that have waited for so many years. During the examination of Christine's possessions, Jane finds a gun. What is unusual is that Christine abhorred guns and that it actually belonged to an eccentric and wealthy Minneapolis family. This family had members of the household brutally murdered the night before Christine died of cancer. <br /> <br />Jane is unable to put aside the gun and other discoveries she's made. She is determined to learn what happened at the Simoneau household and how Christine fit in with the murders. As she searches, a Christine look-alike moves to town, clouding Jane's ability to think clearly. <br /> <br />Jane's past and present collide in a deadly and sensational manner. Only Jane can find out what truly happened. But it just might put her and others in a great deal of danger. <br /> <br />This latest episode in the Jane Lawless series is as emotional and dramatic as I've ever seen Ellen Hart's writing. Her plot is both fascinating and heart wrenching, the characters full-bodied and complex with all the real-life human frailties and vulnerabilities. The intensity of emotions is so real you'll find yourself drawn in and living the story. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: The Iron Girl is one of the best and most intriguing mysteries of 2005.

We all have people in our lives who are difficult - who rub us the wrong way. Maybe that sandpaper person in your life actually lives under the same roof as you. Perhaps that sandpaper person is you. <br /> <br />Sandpaper people are those difficult relationships that God often uses, to upset our plans and redirect us to doing His purpose. Southerland believes that if there is something we need, such as patience, God will surround us with irritating people. If we need to be more loving to people, unlovable people will pop up in our lives. You get the idea. <br /> <br />Southerland's book, through personal stories, biblical stories and a study guide, gives us the information and processes by which we can discover and apply God's relationship principles in working with or living with sandpaper people. And in doing so we can become a more devoted follower of Christ as we choose to live and love all those we come in contact with, just as God loves us. <br /> <br />My personal favorite chapters are: Be Forgiving: Forgive and Forget, Be Confrontational: Care Enough to Confront and Be Committed: Refuse to Walk Away.

Living the journey is important but one learns in reading The Dancing Healers by psychiatrist Carl Hammerschlag that the sharing of the journey can be equally as important. He shares personal stories and stories of those Native Americans who taught him his knowledge of life and healing. This is an opportunity to see the physical and spiritual life from another's perspective, and it contributes to a greater understanding of different life views. <br /> <br />Following medical school, Hammerschlag chose to serve New Mexico's Native American population rather than serving in Viet Nam, and later he continued this service in Arizona. It was through this 20-year immersion in the Native American culture that Hammerschlag, a Jew, learned the difference between healing and curing-and reconciled his own issues as a member of an oppressed people. <br /> <br />If Hammerschlag came to \\"Indian country\\" a nave young physician, he soon learned to listen to those who knew more than he did. He also learned to serve his patients in the places they frequented-bars, street corners and barbershops because people talked more easily in those places. He sharpened his listening skills, understood the value of \\"the doing, not talking,\\" began to understand prejudice (including his own), and experienced the give and take of forgiveness and compassion. And he learned that if he was to survive in Indian country, he'd have to learn how to deal with his own anger and that of his patients. <br /> <br />Hammerschlag's experience is a loving, thoughtful and respectful view of the Native American culture. We might all do better to listen more; \\"do rather than talk\\"; respect others and learn from them; and be quick to give love and forgiveness in equal parts. <br /> <br />The Dancing Healers is a thought-provoking view of one man's life. Read it with an open mind and learn and apply the concepts to your own life. <br />	2005-08-10

My interest in Shirley Cheng's story evolved out of my own family's struggles with the crippling and little known disease of children: Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA). I want to learn as much as I can about the disease in case I happen across something that will help my beloved granddaughter, Caroline. What I didn't count on was being drawn in and captivated by Cheng's story. <br /> <br />Cheng was diagnosed with JRA as an infant, didn't attend school until she was eleven (due to numerous hospitalizations), lost her eyesight at age seventeen and received her high school diploma at age nineteen. She hopes to continue her education at Harvard University. <br /> <br />What makes Cheng's story so compelling is not just the debilitating disease of JRA but of the struggles she and her mother, Juliet, encountered with the medical and social service system. These systems demanded a regiment of treatment Juliet didn't believe was appropriate for her daughter. The result was extreme conflict where Juliet was taken to court in the attempt to force the treatment on Shirley. <br /> <br />This is the story of a mother's dedication and commitment to her child, and it is most of all the story of a strong, brave and determined young woman to live her life to the fullest, even with all its limitations. Cheng dreams big dreams and has the tenacity to make them come true. <br /> <br />This heartwarming story is one you'll want to read. <br />	2005-08-10

If you take the good information about leadership and reduce it to sentences, you'll have Hartley and Hartman's If I Knew Then What I Know Now. If you take those brief, insightful sentences and put them into action, you'll be on your way to becoming a leadership role model. And that is precisely what the authors want for their readers. <br /> <br />If I Knew Then What I Know Now is filled with 248 sentences meant to be read, pondered and put into action. Many of these sentences are things we know but rarely think about. But when they are in front of us, we read and say, \\"Yes!\\" <br /> <br />I have my list of favorites: <br /> <br />Work hard and smart simultaneously.  <br />Take up a sport that will replenish you physically and allow you to meet new people.  <br />Never drink alcohol in front of the people you mentor.  <br />Admit when you are mistaken.  <br />Don't gossip.  <br />Don't use ten words when two will do.  <br />Be the biggest encourager you know.  <br />Don't live in the past.  <br />Leadership is action, not talking about action.  <br />Your legacy will revolve around your actions, not your name.  <br />Love what you do.  <br />Don't feel guilty for saying no.  <br />Believe anything is possible with hard work.  <br />And my favorite: Instead of listening to people complain about all that is wrong, give them a title and a deadline to fix the problem. They will either accomplish something amazing or they will shut up and stop bugging you, either way you have succeeded. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews has shared fourteen leadership sentences we would all do well to put into action. There are two hundred forty-eight waiting for you to discover for yourself. <br />	2005-08-10

Author Pam Erickson is the third generation to grow up in Cloquet, Minnesota. Her father's parents survived the fire of 1918, and The Memory Quilt was inspired by their story.    Lisa Hanson is ill with the flu. For comfort her mother gives Lisa her Grandmother Inga's quilt to wrap herself in while she recovers. Lisa cuddles in the quilt, thinking loving thoughts of her beloved grandmother, and soon falls asleep. She awakes to find herself in Cloquet, Minnesota on October 12, 1918-the day the entire city burned, killing many people. And not only is Lisa in another time, but she has become her great-aunt Liisa, who was never found following the fire.    Lisa (Liisa) knows what is about to happen to the town of Cloquet and its residents but is unable to do anything about the terrifying events. She can, however, find out what happened to her great-aunt Liisa. The frightening thing is that as Liisa, she might die in the fire. Does Lisa survive? Does she solve the mystery?    The Memory Quilt is a wonderful Young Adult novel filled with adventure, mystery, history, and terrifying events that will keep the reader turning the pages and will encourage them to ask questions about their own family history. And they too can play a grand game of \\"what if?\\"    I strongly recommend The Memory Quilt for a grand and exciting read. The part the quilt plays in the mystery is fascinating!	2005-08-07

This is the sensuous, sizzling and adventurous story of Huntington St. John and Taylor Kincaid. <br /> <br />The book opens with Kincaid, the athletic cat burglar, being brutally thrown back in a filthy jail cell in South America, after her fifth escape attempt. She was arrested for breaking into the safe of a notorious crime lord, on the trail of some famous and valuable diamonds. She also decided the safe's contents of miscellaneous papers and computer disks were worth taking also. <br /> <br />T-FLAC must have the computer disks to prevent a major terrorist attack. They've done a lot of research on Kincaid, and decide she must have the discs. T-FLAC member Huntington St. John is sent to rescue her. Temporarily blinded from a head injury, St. John gets her to safety, then in a very steamy scene, helps her to clean up. Leaving St. John handcuffed to the bed, Kincaid escapes, only to be caught months later by the team. Of course we discover later Kincaid's true job. <br /> <br />The villains of Hot Ice are insanely nasty; the plot and pacing is like an action movie, and the sex is hot enough that you'll need to read it with some cold water and a fan nearby. <br /> <br />There are a few hard-to-believe bits in the story. But Hot Ice is a fun, exciting, thrill-packed romp with attractive, tough, daring characters and exotic locales. It's NOT Jane Austen. <br />	2005-08-07

DeKok fully explores the terrain of infertility and abortion. Thousands of women in our nation and the world daily face both issues. These subjects are not often covered in Christian fiction. DeKok tackles the subject of infertility and abortion respectfully, with deep feelings and great understanding. <br /> <br />Jonica is struggling to come to terms with her inability to bear a child. Stacie is pregnant but isn't ready to be a mother. The two women meet in the waiting room of a medical clinic. And as dissimilar as they are, they just can't forget each other. They do the one thing they didn't count on. They reach out to each other, and along the way they become friends. <br /> <br />Jonica offers friendship to Stacie who is devastated following her abortion. She shares her faith in God with Stacie and patiently waits for God to work in Stacie's life. And Stacie, sharing her grief with Jonica, helps Jonica begin to accept her infertility. But it is when both step out in faith and really hear God that the healing begins. <br /> <br />The story is told in the alternating voices of Jonica and Stacie, and I enjoyed getting into each woman's head. <br /> <br />DeKok's characters are full, rich and real. The storyline is difficult but DeKok handles it adeptly. No matter your feelings about the subject matter, Rain Dance will touch your heart. <br />	2005-08-07

Every once in a while a nugget of gold crops up in the short story collections published each year. My gold nugget is Big Cats by Holiday Reinhorn. <br /> <br />Reinhorn writes simply delicious dramas of \\"real life\\" and \\"real people\\" who are full-bodied, rich, multi-dimensional complex beings with complex stories. It is her talent that makes the complex, simple. She alternates between humor, sadness, poignancy and tenderness in a way that shouts out that she has developed her voice and speaks it with strength and commitment. I love the way her writing seeps into my consciousness and makes me live what she writes. Each story has its own drama to breathe life into the story, capturing its soul. <br /> <br />The title story, \\"Big Cats,\\" of this collection is about two young girls who work at a zoo. They fight, attempting to be the \\"big cats\\" they aren't as yet. The author fixes her sights on the girls' minds and captures their spirit. <br /> <br />I love \\"My Name\\"! It is the story of a Vietnam vet who's lived in his own prison, so he understands and emphasizes with the catatonic woman he cares for and who calls him by her son's name. Though brief it is the connection the lonely man yearns for and is expressed with absolute tenderness. <br /> <br />Some years ago Reinhorn wrote the screenplay for the film Last Seen. Being familiar with the film it was wonderful to read the story that birthed it. It is about the mysterious disappearance of high school senior Jennifer Langsam. <br /> <br />Read the rest of Reinhorn's collection yourself.  I don't want to give anything away. Read it and savor the flavors of life. <br />	2005-08-07

Roxana Robinson has authored two short story collections, a biography of Georgia O'Keeffe, and three novels. Sweetwater is one of my top-ten all-time favorite novels. So it was with great expectation that I began reading A Perfect Stranger and Other Stories. And what a delectable read it was. Robinson is as proficient at writing short fiction as she is writing the novel. And she seems to be equally as comfortable. <br /> <br />Each story in Robinson's collection immerses the reader into a world of relationships where she introduces us to her rich, complex characters and then allows us to become an intimate voyeur in the fabric of their thoughts and lives. <br /> <br />It is impossible to discuss each story in a collection so I will mention my favorites. \\"The Pilgrimage\\" paints a picture so strong, I lived the emotions of the woman as her fantasy abruptly vanished and she lived her humiliation. \\"Treatment\\" is about vulnerability, the facing of our own mortality. But though all the stories are superb, and everyone, for their own reasons, will have a favorite, mine is \\"Choosing Sides.\\" Love is a choice; a conscious decision. And if that choice is a child-it's forever. <br /> <br />A Perfect Stranger and Other Stories is a book to be read, the words savored and then read again and again and again. Roxana Robinson is truly a gifted storyteller. <br />	2005-08-05

She also contributes to her family, which is living lower than we all would expect in Beverly Hills, by authoring celebrities' cookbooks. Miriam is currently collaborating with Kimberly on A Starlet's Secrets of Sexy Cooking and is longing to pen her own cookbook. <br /> <br />Miriam is mom to college-bound twins Jake and Emma and to Lisa, a news reporter who is pregnant, unmarried, and wants her mother to be the full-time babysitter so she can concentrate on her career; wife to Alan, a former struggling screenwriter; and daughter to the mother who might be moving in with her. <br /> <br />Miriam's best friend Kate is a wealthy florist who continues, after many years, to lust after the only man she believes she ever loved. After checking out Erik on the Internet and contacting him, Kate learns Erik is the ambassador to Malaysia, married, and still lusts after her. Kate decides to travel to see Erik, to test her long-lost love and the desires of her loins. She drags Miriam along, giving her the escape from family responsibilities that seem to be closing in on her well-defined life. <br /> <br />Will Kate find true love? Will Miriam find herself and learn to establish personal boundaries? Will the reader survive all the scrumptious recipes at the end of each chapter? <br /> <br />I chuckled throughout the book and will read another of Boorstin's novels. My only criticism is that so many books these days treat \\"cheating on a mate\\" and bed hopping as normal and acceptable. But that is just a personal observation. <br /> <br />Cookin' for Love's author, Sharon Boorstin, writes a sassy and fun novel with many interesting twists and turns that can be enjoyed by all. <br />	2005-08-04

An aging William \\"Wild Bill\\" Cody rode into Deadwood (in the Black Hills) in 1876 with his longtime friend Charley Utter. And it was in Deadwood that he was murdered on August 2, 1876. <br /> <br />While Wild Bill dies, the people and situations in Deadwood revolve around him as a man and the \\"legend.\\" And it is the very essence of Wild Bill's personality that runs through the book even though a great deal of the story centers around Charley Utter. <br /> <br />Dexter divides Deadwood into four parts. The first is Bill Cody, next is China Doll (a beautiful Chinese woman), then Bill's wife Agnes Lake, and finally Calamity Jane. <br /> <br />Deadwood is not your typical western. And there are serious and humorous moments. The humanness of Wild Bill in the bushes relieving himself (which was difficult given his prostrate problems) when young Malcolm Nash accidentally shot Wild Bill's horse in the head is both fear provoking and funny. A somber and touching moment was Wild Bill's last letter to his wife Agnes. The harshness of a prostitute's death and trip to the \\"death house\\" is chilling. And then there is Agnes' trip to Deadwood following her husband's death. All these situations and so much more make up the grand book that is Deadwood. <br /> <br />I've enjoyed so many of Pete Dexter's books. But Deadwood is my favorite. To pigeon hole it as a western might keep people from reading it and that would be sad. Western aficionados will enjoy it but readers of good literature will love it. Dexter has the ability to tell a story in a way that simply commands your attention. <br /> <br />Dexter's use of language and his sense of time and place are brilliant. The characters are real, complex people with all the strengths and weaknesses of human beings everywhere. <br />	2005-08-03

But before she dies, she intends to give Quinn the most important thing she's ever owned. So just before her death, Maura celebrates Quinn's birthday by giving her an antique trunk and its contents-a trunk she doesn't want to fall into the hands of her spoiled and selfish grandchildren. <br /> <br />It is only after Maura's death that Quinn discovers the trunk's contents and realizes that she would have a security she hadn't known in years.

And Quinn's brother, Carlton intends on stealing more from Quinn than just her college fund. And who is the other strange man following Quinn and why? <br /> <br />Maura's Trunk is a fast-paced, feel-good novel about an eighteen-year-old with few options until a trunk enters her life. How exciting to receive a surprise gift and realize upon opening it that everything you had been denied in the past would be available to you. <br />	2005-08-03

When I picked up Bolton's Growing Your Own Turtleneck...and other benefits of aging, I expected what I know. What I mean is the chapters in most humor books published by Christian houses begin or end with scripture, and the story is told and ends with what I call a wraparound-a way to bring it back in some way to faith. <br /> <br />Bolton's book did none of these. The chapters have quotes by famous people and the stories are just that: humorous stories that could have been published by any secular publisher. Now that's not a bad thing; it's just something I noticed. What I missed is the \\"moral to the story.\\" <br /> <br />That said, I enjoyed the way Bolton thinks about everyday things that we all experience. And I embrace that someone will write a humor book about me-a woman of a certain age. <br /> <br />A few of my favorite chapters: Life in Reality (forget surviving the Australian outback, let's put a trailer in the desert, without air-conditioning and fill it with ten menopausal women!), Mind Games (physical exercise-nothing else needs to be said), and That Settles It (diets-now nothing else really needs saying here either). <br /> <br />The final chapters are really thought provoking and worth the read. I loved On Purpose (you have to read it, I'm not telling) and Without You (think Clarence from It's A Wonderful Life and then read the chapter, ponder and live it). <br /> <br />Bolton give us things to think and laugh about, and who doesn't need that! <br />	2005-08-03

Breaking Point features Max Bhagat, FBI agent, with Gina Vitagliano. <br /> <br />Brockmann began her career writing category romances in the mid 90s, and then she discovered a fascinating source of material: Navy SEALs. She published her first Navy SEAL romance, Prince Joe, in 1996. Her first book with Ballantine was The Unsung Hero, also featuring a Navy SEAL theme. Some of Brockmann's characters spill over into her other books, which can make it fun to follow their stories. <br /> <br />The structure of Breaking Point involves flashbacks where we see Max and Gina when their rocky relationship started as Max recovered from a serious gunshot wound. We see Gina and her friend Molly in Africa, working at a medical clinic. Everything creeps forward to the present day when Max receives notice that Gina has been killed in a terrorist bombing in Hamburg. <br /> <br />Max and his assistant (and friend) Jules Cassidy fly to Hamburg to identify and recover Gina's remains but discover that the woman in the coffin is not Gina. Max must unravel the mystery of who was in Hamburg with Gina and exactly how the dangerous Grady Morant is involved. Max and Jules discover that Grady is the reason Gina and Molly (Grady's wife) are missing; apparently kidnapped due to pressure by an old enemy. Max resigns and puts Jules in charge. With massive worldwide terror alerts, Max and Jules are virtually on their own as they track the women to Indonesia. Things are further complicated because Molly is pregnant, has just had a breast lump biopsy and cancer is suspected. <br /> <br />There are a few harrowing days when Max, Grady, Molly, Gina and Jules attempt to escape from the kidnapper's house; but of course that gives Gina and Max time to communicate their true feelings for each other. And Jules, well he is one of my favorite Brockmann characters. He is a gay FBI agent who is strong, funny, sweet, and kind. <br /> <br />The suspense is taut, the men honorableand heroic; the women tenacious and tough, yet tender. The villains and violence are believable. Brockmann's books are perfect for our time. We need heroes like this now. <br />	2005-08-03

I love it when I find an author that thrills and excites me when I read their work. You know the one-your pulse quickens when you turn to page one and maintains until you finish the story. I hate it when I have to wait for the next installment of scintillating adventures. Charlie Huston is someone I've discovered, and I can't wait to read more and will follow his career with my hard-earned cash. Six Bad Things is the second book of a trilogy. <br /> <br />Former minor league baseball player Hank Thompson has a problem. He figured he'd be safe living the good life in Mexico with the $4 million he stole from the Russian Mafia just before leaving New York. Wrong! Now three years later a chatty Russian backpacker (who is actually a bounty hunter) is asking dangerous questions and Hank figures he'd best head back north. The lives of his family might well depend on it. On the way to taking care of business Hank will face a passel of bad guys who want to interrupt his trip. Nothing is easy for Hank. <br /> <br />I haven't read Caught Stealing yet, but you'd better believe I'll have it in my hands shortly. Then I'm going to settle in for what is probably going to be an entertaining ride, if it's anything like Six Bad Things. <br /> <br />If you like your suspense hard-boiled and don't mind violence, run, don't walk, to the bookstore. This book is fast-paced, exciting, believable and occasionally funny. Huston is a grand storyteller; you'll slip into the plot and buy into the \\"if this happened to me-well, that's just what I would do\\" mentality. <br />	2005-08-03

Two young children are dead as a result of a house fire. <br /> <br />It is soon apparent that another child had been in the house, but the two men are unable to locate that child. The dead children's mother, Edith Tuttle, while upset over her children's death, fails to mention the missing child. But the reader knows that Edith didn't even bother naming the one-year-old missing girl following her birth. She is known only as \\"Baby Tuttle\\" and is an unusual child-one who never smiles or cries; only stares with her dark, penetrating eyes. <br /> <br />Nightingale is not only concerned about the missing child; he believes the fire is suspicious. He begins searching for answers and soon discovers a quiet but terrified child under the ugly house where she crawled to save herself. What Nightingale and Bly discover means Baby Tuttle will need a permanent home as her mother will have her own semi-permanent home for many years to come. <br /> <br />Billy's sister, Annie and husband Sebastian adopt the child (Merry) and the years pass without incident. When Merry, at age eleven, becomes interested in her history, Billy and the Bly's concoct a fantasy history to protect Merry from her horrific past. But a letter Merry mails inadvertently sets into motion a series of events that will threaten her and her family years later when Merry is a fledgling ballerina. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Tabula Rasa, by Shelly Reuben is simply terrific! The characters are well drawn, complex and unique. The plot is both horrifying and scrumptious with fascinating information about arson, adoption, dancing and the consequences of an obsessive quest and the lies told to protect a loved one. It is scintillating and an absolute must read! <br />	2005-08-03

In the box she finds an old yellowed photo with the words \\"Borden Street, Goldsboro\\" written on the back. <br /> <br />Now that Ariel's an adult she's determined to discover her past. She knows that the photograph can provide her with needed answers. Ariel will travel to Goldsboro, shedding her abusive boyfriend John and the years of foster homes. <br /> <br />Ariel locates the house in the photograph, is hired as the housekeeper and learns 101 Borden Street is haunted-trapped in time waiting to be released from the violence that occurred there over a hundred and sixty years earlier. Only Ariel can free the house from the past and release the star-crossed lovers from their prison. But in helping others, she may lose her own life without learning about her own family history. <br /> <br />Susan Eileen Walker writes a fascinating suspense story that will keep you turning the pages. The plot is exciting and she is able to deftly weave the present into the past. I enjoyed it! <br /> <br />That said I have one criticism. The story ends so abruptly I thought I'd received a book that didn't have all the pages. I kept thinking that there had to be more and then learned that that was indeed how the author chose to end the book. For me it felt unfinished, though you could also argue for the opposite. <br /> <br />It's a great read if you love good story telling. <br />	2005-08-03

He also explores the major themes of the Bible and the interaction of themes between the Old Testament (and the Old Covenant) and the New Testament (and the New Covenant).  <br /> <br />He provides not only an understanding of the three major branches of Christianity (Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant), but also does a wonderful job of explaining the development of each and some of the important subgroups.  <br /> <br />No exploration of the Christian faith would be complete without also exploring what is NOT the Christian faith-and why. This includes a brief look at religions that developed in the United States-including Mormonism, Christian Science, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Unity School of Christianity as well as an overview of major world religions including Judaism, Buddhism, and Islam. <br /> <br />Schwarz also does a great job of laying out the major teachings of Jesus in the gospels as well as His sayings, miracles, and parables. He helps the reader to a clear understanding of the timing of key events in both the old and new testaments, as well as the development of the Christian church following the era of the apostles.  <br /> <br />One of the most valuable chapters is the chapter on growing in faith and walking as a Christian. This one should be read carefully and slowly-several times! <br /> <br />This book can be read very quickly for a clear overview of the various topics -or one can take the time to really think about the various insights offered and experience wonderful growth opportunities.	2005-08-03

Perfect in every respect from the Crane stationery it was embossed on to the choice of place-an upscale Italian restaurant. Only one problem, the invitation is from Jesus. It has to be some sort of joke. If it is, it's an expensive one. <br /> <br />Nick Cominsky is a 30-something strategic planner with a lovely wife, Mattie, and a toddler daughter, Sara. Life should be great, but it's not. His 60-70 hour workweeks have stressed his relationship with Mattie. And there are things going on at work that just aren't right, but Nick feels powerless to do anything about it. <br /> <br />So Nick spends the next three weeks thinking about the invitation, wondering who sent it, and saying nothing to anyone. And on the day of the dinner invitation he goes-more out of curiosity than anything else. And he meets a man his age in a blue suit who answers to the name Jesus and claims to have been born in Bethlehem. <br /> <br />For the next several hours Nick has more than a meal. He throws up every objection he has to organized religion in any form-and gets no argument from Jesus. Instead he gets answers to all the things that have caused him pain and grief in his life. That includes what he can do to heal his marriage and most of all what it means to have a way to God, rather than a path-and why the difference is so important. And he learns who put his dinner guest up to sending him the invitation in the first place. <br /> <br />For the reader who has had more questions than answers about God-this book is for you. For the reader who has found God, but doesn't know how to answer the question-\\"Why should there be only one way?\\"-this book is for you. And to readers who want their walk to match their talk-this book is for you. I highly recommend it. <br />	2005-08-02

Through these, she helps the reader of Finding and Following God's Will traverse the sometimes-circuitous road of searching for, seizing and following the exciting path God wants us all to travel. <br /> <br />Kise gives the reader a road map where in each of twelve chapters, she poses simple and common questions about discovering and following God's will. I suspect, based on where they are in their quest, each individual will have a favorite chapter. Mine is chapter twelve. What if I missed God's Plan? I already knew this information, but needed to be reminded once again. <br /> <br />Each chapter begins with the question and is accompanied by a bible story, real life stories and biblical references. At the end of each chapter is the Key (summary). The study question at the end of the book allows the reader to delve deeper into areas of particular interest to us as individuals. This book really is a handbook for Christians. The simple and straightforward format makes it easy to read and refer back to for future discovery. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews suggest you read Kise's book and then keep it on hand for future reference. <br />	2005-08-02

Xenia Ruiz's debut novel, Choose Me, is definitely asking to be \\"chosen.\\" <br /> <br />Eve Clemente is an African-Latina single mother of two college-aged sons. Recovered from a disastrous marriage, Eve is a strong Christian woman determined to maintain her five years of celibacy. She believes suffering contributes to the growth of people's faith. <br /> <br />Adam Black is a man with women problems and a probation officer, as well as being a cancer survivor who has put his Christianity on the shelf. He just doesn't understand why God would allow His children to suffer. <br /> <br />A man and a woman. Adam and Eve. They meet at a party and embark on a journey of learning to love-each other and God Himself. And while on their journey they agree to a celibate relationship (until marriage), which becomes increasingly difficult, given their mutual attraction and growing love for each other. The problem is: neither wants to get married. What to do, what to do? <br /> <br />Ruiz's novel is populated with real, rich and complex characters you will grow to deeply care and root for as they traverse the winding and bumpy roads of racism, celibacy, adultery and acceptance. I love Eve. We seldom have the opportunity to experience a Hispanic woman in Christian fiction. And Adam is a wonderful black role model. How refreshing in a society that often portrays African-American males as less than stellar. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: We're looking forward to more from Ms. Ruiz! <br />	2005-08-02

We all know just how important 'dad' is, and how deeply we hurt and how profoundly we are impacted throughout our lives when he isn't there for us, or betrays or disappoints us. So for all the women who carry the burden of the wounds left by fathers who were/are absent physically, emotionally, spiritually or through abuse, please read A Dad-Shaped Hole in My Heart. <br /> <br />Dr. Wright, through narrative, case studies (stories), survey/assessment, scripture and written exercises helps daughters bring to the forefront their experiences and disappointments with their fathers - in order to resolve them and be healed. <br /> <br />I found the chapters on fatherless daughters (physically or emotionally absent or abusive) to be particularly powerful. The symptoms are worth reading to see if they fit you or someone you love. The chapter on daughters of divorce and the Adult Child of Divorce Characteristics (ACOD) is a must read. Then ask yourself, do I fit into any of these characteristics? No doubt any daughter of divorce will see themselves in some of the nine traits. <br /> <br />But it is the chapters on grieving absent fathers, facing the past and how to change your relationship with your dad that is so compelling. But the most important chapter is about God as your real father-God, the father who loves you unconditionally and has been and will always be there for you. <br /> <br />I believe that this book will be helpful not only to daughters but to their fathers as well. Daughters read the book and prayerfully follow the suggestions. Dads, read the book, see yourself and learn how to change and help heal that \\"dad-shaped hole\\" in your daughter's heart. Armchair Interviews recommends this book as a significant and helpful resource. <br />	2005-07-30

My kids are so old they are out of our house and our wallets - at least most of the time. <br /> <br />Parenting, viewed in glorious hindsight, surely was easy - except maybe those teen years. <br /> <br />When kids are little they try your parenting know-how; when they are teens they try your patience and everything else.  If you raised them right, and some good luck prevailed, they try and hopefully succeed in becoming good human beings. <br /> <br />Harried parents, chaotic situations, second guessing our decisions are all fodder for humor - and Bob does it well.  Sometimes all you can do is laugh (but just don't let the kids see you do it). <br /> <br />As a syndicated columnist of \\"Parent to Parent,\\" Bob has captured the every-day joys and horrors of parenting, and all the while you read, you are smiling and laughing out loud.  I know I did. What a hoot! <br /> <br />If you are in the thick of raising kids, give yourself a gift.  If you are grandparents, you know your own kids need this book - because you raised them and remember all their tricks, trials and tribulations.

This World War II book is unique because it's told from a child's viewpoint.  The author was born in 1934 and her home was in the Bavarian mountain area of Berchtesgaden where Hitler had built Eagle's Nest, a fortified compound for him and his high-level commanders' families. <br /> <br />The author describes the day-to-day life of the German people following their defeat in WWI and the pursuant inflation, job loss and depression.  <br /> <br />This story is interesting because I have visited the part of Germany Hunt discusses and saw the beauty of it and how isolated the Eagle's Nest was.  The author has included some beautiful photos of that area, in addition to historical moments - like the GIs in her home town pulling down the Nazi flag. <br /> <br />Her story tells us how much the Nazi doctrine governed what they ate, what they said and sang, what they named their children, and most of all, how they had to behave to stay out of terrible trouble.  Teachers tried to get students to tell on their family members who might talk against Hitler.  One aunt, when face to face with Hitler, found her arm rising in the Heil Hitler salute as if his stare hypnotized her - and years later, she shared that she was embarrassed to give in, but terrified not to. <br /> <br />Hunt, an idyllic 3-year-old Aryan blonde child, was photographed on Hitler's lap. She went to school with Nazi official's children, and after the Nuremberg trials, realized that some of those children had just said good-bye to their father before he was executed. <br /> <br />After the war, Hunt felt that patriotism (a word she came to hate) became the excuse for almost everything that had happened.  The German people tended to whitewash what their Fuhrer did. <br /> <br />The author brought war to our door, our eyes and our hearts.  Armchair Interviews says that On Hitler's Mountain gives great historical viewpoint - but more important, a personal view of war, and a worthwhile reminder that it affects youngand old alike. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-26

Ruby Taylor, the \\"Sassy Cinderella\\" of this story is a gutsy, opinionated, witty, new Christian who loves \\"Jesus, chocolate and a mocha with the steam rising from it\\" - and in that order. At the age of thirty-one she still lives with her mother, also a new Christian. <br /> <br />When Ruby was sixteen her mother went to prison for embezzlement and spent years there while Ruby and her brother, Jimmy, survived in foster homes. Ruby says, \\"I figure she owes me a few years of mothering.\\" <br />  <br />Her brother suddenly shows up after a long absence under suspicious circumstances in the early hours of the morning. At first they are convinced it's a prowler and call the police. The responding policeman is none other than Wesley Burgess, Ruby's old love interest. <br />  <br />Ruby has been hired as an instructor to replace a professor who is reported to have committed suicide. As she hears bits and pieces about the death of Theodore Aldridge, she begins to doubt that it was suicide and proceeds to conduct her own investigation into Aldridge's relationships with his ex-wife, children, lover and a mysterious student whom she now has in one of her classes - who seems to be stalking her. <br />  <br />The more Ruby gets involved with the investigation the more she gets re-involved with Wesley.  Since they both have made a decision to commit to living by God's Rules, they want to behave in a way that they will be worthy of the title \\"Christian.\\"  This however leads to some struggles with temptation. <br />  <br />Sassy Cinderella is a well-written, fast-paced, exciting page-turner and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The character I loved the most is that of Celeste, the cleaning lady who has Down's Syndrome.   Celeste, with her child-like faith and her unconditional love for everyone, touched my heart big-time, and the message of what God's love is really all about came through loud and clear. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />	2005-07-26

But Leo explodes with anger at Martin's announcement, demands he meet him for lunch where much of the novel takes place. <br /> <br />At lunch Leo Firestone tells when he acted as an extern for his physician father, Dr. Samuel Firestone during the summer of 1943.   It was the summer he lost his boyhood, and his life changed forever. <br /> <br />Dr. Samuel Firestone practiced in Hobart, New Jersey and was considered a doctor whom everyone could count on no matter the emergency or time of day.  An excellent diagnostician, Dr. Firestone knew the community's needs and secrets. <br /> <br />While working for his father, Leo learns about black-market adoptions, abortion, murder, his mother's drug addiction as well as breaking the law while the country is at war.  With his childhood friend, Harmony, Leo investigates the activities of the scrapyard owned by evil Oscar, helpful Martin -- and the parts of his father's life that trouble him.   <br /> <br />It is what happens after Leo finished his story that brings resolution to a lifetime of regret and sadness. <br /> <br />Karp's prose brings Hobart and the era alive.

The days are long, hot and sunny, and the evenings are warm and breezy (ok, you do have to dodge mosquitoes occasionally). I love to read, but summer reading is especially scrumptious. Fast, wonderful, interesting and maybe even intriguing and thrilling. And a new author, well, all the better. <br /> <br />That said, I picked up a debut novel recently. It's Jury of One by Laura Bradford. I read it in two sittings and didn't have a clue to the identity of the killer (though I tried to sleuth it out) because I really wanted to know \\"who done it.\\" <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading a murder mystery where there was death-but I didn't have to experience the gruesomeness of it. The characters are interesting, likeable and fully developed. And the plot is compelling. <br /> <br />Elise Jenkins is a young new reporter with the Ocean Point Weekly and Mitch Burns is a police detective in Ocean Point, New Jersey. A series of murders are plaguing the beach community of Ocean Point and the inhabitants are terrified. The clues lead to Madame Mariah, a New Jersey boardwalk fortuneteller who has made some interesting predictions. Elise and Mitch had better be careful while tracking down the murderer.

Everett Beal (who I believe to be in his 70s) is one Southern gentleman's experience growing up and living in the south. Beal begins his journey with the arrival of his ancestors from Scotland and continues with his immediate family in Valdosta, Georgia and then moves on as an adult to Griffin, Georgia. <br /> <br />Beal honestly and courageously discusses the good and the bad of the south and of the heritage he acquired through being born \\"Southern.\\" That heritage included segregation, integration and all of the issues surrounding the change that descended upon his world in the 1960s. <br /> <br />There are moments Beal lovingly recalls his boyhood adventures, the cultural songs and games, as well as the love and respect he felt for the black men and women who cared for his family and their property. However, other times the experience of integration, though acknowledged as right, was confusing and perceived as allowing no time to accept the change. What had always been accepted as \\"the way it was done\\" was no longer acceptable or appropriate. <br /> <br />This is an interesting and personal view of a culture that is closed to those who have not been born into it. The treatment of black people-thought acceptable, even seen as benevolent by white folks-is at times painful to read. The difficulty of change can be seen as the author continually refers to black people as \\"coloreds.\\" I didn't feel that he was using the term in a derogatory manner (though others might perceive it to be so), I just felt that that is the way it always has been. Beal writes about the way things are when most people only have the courage to think it. Anyone wanting a first-hand account of Southern life in turbulent times should read Southern Winds. <br />	2005-07-25

Some people you might not recognize but their stories are equally as fascinating as those you know because Goldberg believes they are pulling some important behind the scenes \\"strings\\" that are and have the potential of \\"screwing us up\\" further. <br /> <br />The sentence that conservatives who read this book will be repeating until it seems like a mantra is a quote by journalist and author John Underwood: \\"In a society where anything goes, everything, eventually, will. A society that stands for nothing will fall for anything-and then, of course, will simply fall.\\" <br /> <br />Conservatives will undoubtedly embrace Goldberg's book and liberals will most likely be enraged by their portrayal. <br /> <br />No matter your political bent, Goldberg's book is a \\"must read.\\" <br />	2005-07-25

She suspects that Brother Dominic at the Benedictine monastery may know something about her mother's injury. But, she becomes distracted by her attraction to Brother Thomas, who is at the monastery seeking solace after the death of his wife and unborn child in a tragic car accident. Nelle's good friends Kat and Hepzibah appear to be clueless as to what would cause her distress. But are they really?

Increasingly our society seems to be growing bullies that are \\"bigger and badder\\" than in days past. Izzy Kalman, a school psychologist for twenty-five years, tackles the bully problem with interesting, unique and logical methods in his book Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies into Friends! <br /> <br />Kalman says we act like animals because we are animals-and what differentiates us from lower forms is our souls and our brain capacity. His goal is to teach us how to make bullies our buddies. He believes that if people follow his instruction they will defeat bullies. <br /> <br />The author suggests that people are picked on because they become angry and try to make the bully stop bullying. He indicates that bullies don't really care if someone wears glasses or is overweight. The bully is just \\"having fun\\" because what a bully really wants is power, respect and popularity. The bully is testing the person being bullied. <br /> <br />Kalman suggests we think of bullies as sparring partners who will give us practice and train us to win in the \\"game of bullying.\\" His book includes: 7 rules to turn Bullies into Buddies, dialogues, quizzes and experiments. He also includes topics such as Internet Bullies, Sibling Bullies, Parent Bullies, Teacher Bullies, and When Others are Bullied. <br /> <br />The bottom line seems to be: Take responsibility for yourself. Understand what the bully is doing and why and then change your reaction to the behavior as this will change the bullies' behavior. <br /> <br />This is a simple, logical, straight-forward handbook to help eradicate bullying.

She admits there are other family secrets she must share and vows to reveal them when the time is right. Before Andrea can share them she is killed in an accident. Andrew turns to his mother's close friend, Karen, in hopes that she can help him uncover the secrets and piece together the truth. <br /> <br />With every new event and secret revealed Andrew turns to the inner source-his relationship with God-to sort through each new development and decides how to respond.

At the young age of 20, upper-middle class Mike Yankoski traveled with his friend Sam to six cities in the United States: Denver, Washington D.C., Portland, San Francisco, Phoenix, and San Diego. <br /> <br />You might think that there is nothing special about traveling around the U.S. The thing is, Mike and Sam felt led by the Holy Spirit to live their faith in order to better understand the plight of the American homeless population and to witness how the Church is, or is not involved. <br /> <br />Under the Overpass consists of five months of stories and reflections of the preparation and travel of Mike and Sam on the \\"mean\\" streets of America. Mike discusses how it felt to plummet overnight from being an upper-middle class college student to a scum-of-the earth untouchable. With no money, panhandling became their job, and if it didn't pay well, then dumpster-diving for food was their mode of grocery shopping. They also had no safe place to live or sleep. Mike's stories of living with alcoholics, drug addicts, the mentally ill and social outcasts will astound and shock you as they did me. <br /> <br />All Christians who believe they are living their Christian faith would do well to read Under the Overpass and then have a good hard look into their hearts and lives.

Chaon's novel is a story of identity as revealed by Jonah and Troy, half brothers separated by adoption. Troy is placed for adoption, Jonah kept by their mother, both growing up in small Midwest towns. Troy wanders from the influence of his adoptive parents to that of his cousins, low-level drug dealers living in a trailer. Jonah wanders in his own way between his mother Nora and his grandfather, both running from the life they lead. <br /> <br />Eventually, Jonah arms himself with documentation of Troy's existence, and sets out to find him. Troy, separated from his son and wife by a series of his own bad choices, is left with his job at the Stumble Inn, his drug rehabilitation classes at the junior high, and the electronic monitoring ankle device that is part of his parole agreement. When Troy realizes that his co-worker Jonah is actually his half-brother, and that Jonah has lied to him about everything-from their biological connection to the kind of life Jonah lived with their mother-Troy experiences a kind of mirror-vision clarity about his own life. In a series of blundering moves, Jonah makes one final and nearly disastrous entry into Troy's life, setting in motion events that will settle one man's life and throw the other's into an orbit of despair. <br /> <br />Chaon's prose is dense, and at times annoyingly over-written. At the same time, he is able to endow a generally disparaged segment of American culture, the working, under-educated poor, with the dignity of their own being. Neither Troy nor Jonah has big dreams or even ambitions to have big dreams. They are surrounded by people who have settled for what they could grasp, unconcerned with great ambition or legacies beyond their families. They do not travel, or want to. They are grounded in a place where a man can become a prosperous community leader by owning three bars and a bowling alley. And yet, they have that dignity, and for Troy life turns out to be good enough. Sometimes that's all you can ask. <br /> <br />I struggled with this review because the story is fairly simple-but the relationships are not. Armchair Interviews says that if you like stories of complicated relationships you can really get into, give this book with an intriguing title a try. <br />	2005-07-25

Smith turns them into, as my British friend Pam would say, \\"Pithy little statements!\\"  <br /> <br />Smith condenses the motivational information into 42 easy \\"ah-ha\\" chapters, each ending with \\"action steps I will take to...\\" relevant to that chapter's subject. <br /> <br />My favorite thought is near the end of the book: \\"We all think we are in control until things go wrong, and then we lose our sense of control.\\" <br /> <br />Smith wants us to get back in control of our life by using these 42 chapters as jumping-off places. It's an easy read but not a fast one if you really think about and react to each thought geared to your personal betterment. <br /> <br />Here are some of Smith's thoughts I feel are worthy of sharing: <br /> <br />Give your ideas wings; take action when an idea strikes you.  <br />Raise the bar: give yourself permission to live up to your full potential and you will be surprised at how good you will feel.  <br />Test yourself, push yourself and see what you can really do. I believe you will find that you really are an eagle in many ways.  <br />Get your \\"yes\\" magic back. Don't let other people's opinions stop you.  <br />Don't focus on the problem, focus on what you want.  <br />Give yourself credit for doing things right.  <br />Move from the planning stage to the doing stage.  <br />Life is boring without problems.  <br />If the price of gaining knowledge is too high, what will be the price if you don't gain it.  <br />How much time and energy do you take putting up with problems - and why we should deal with them now.  <br />More battles are lost than won (because the other side did something to lose).  <br />Always be positive when you talk about yourself as you are the most important person to hear it.  <br />Act \\"as if\\"-as if what youwant you already have. Sixty Seconds to Success should be on every bookshelf (after you've read it!) and pulled off again and again when you need a motivational push. <br />	2005-07-25

Hickey's degree is in Art History, and she went on to get an MFA from Columbia University. <br /> <br />The Painted Kiss is the intriguing story of the relationship between Gustav Klimt and young Emilie Flge, set in fin de siecle Vienna. Great artists like Mahler, Moser, Egon Schiele, and Kokoschka are part of the story. <br /> <br />Emilie and Klimt became friends, and eventually lovers; and Emilie helped in the Secession movement, when radical artists pulled out of the Kunstlerhaus exhibits, and began their own shows, and publications. Eventually they built their own exhibit hall, called Vienna Secession. Emilie's exposure to Gustav and his friends and their unusual lifestyle made it possible for her to free herself from the stifling restrictions on women in those times. <br /> <br />Emilie's father respects artists (he is a manufacturer of meerschaum pipes), and is eventually resigned to Emilie's sister Helene marrying Gustav's artist brother Ernst. Gustav in turn urges Emile to begin her own fashion house. Eventually it is built with artists from the Viennese Workshop (Wiener Werksttte) designing everything in the interior. Her salon is plain, with white walls, grey carpeting, black woodwork, and white furniture. It was considered very avant garde, and Emilie's creations were also very unusual in the time of corsets and hats and gloves-she was part of the dress reform movement (comfortable loose fitting clothing, with unusual patterns, and luxurious materials). The creation of one of art nouveau's most iconic works, The Kiss, is the climax of the book. The Painted Kiss is very atmospheric, and a great read. <br /> <br />The only work of art is Klimt's portrait of Emilie done in 1902, on the cover. This is my only criticism of the book-that there are not more works of art or photographs. I would recommend Gustav Klimt: Silver, Gold and Precious Stones by Angela Wenzel, part of the Adventures inArt series. (Prestel Verlag, 2000) Despite being a children's book, it is full of wonderful pictures and photos, including one of Gustav and Emilie in a rowboat at the Flge summer house at Kammer am Attersee, pictures of Emilie's salon and many illustrations of Klimt's work. <br />	2005-07-25

We believed we were ordinary; we didn't appreciate our families or our lives in general.  And we had a fantasy life that would make great theatre.  What I really appreciated about Utterly Me, Clarice Bean is that Clarice always gives life her best.   <br /> <br />Clarice and her best friend Betty Moody love the mystery series with heroine Ruby Redfort, so it seems natural that they would use the Redfort books for a school project. <br /> <br />Now that seems simple enough, but then Betty goes missing - and Clarice and the school's problem child are paired together for the book project.  Clarice doesn't initially like the pairing, but as she and Karl work together, she realizes that he's got great ideas and is really pretty nice. <br /> <br />The problems begin when Betty returns and becomes jealous of the relationship that has developed between Clarice and Karl.  When the project trophy disappears, Karl is accused of stealing it. Clarice is determined to solve the mystery and clear Karl's name.  Is she successful in solving the mystery?  And what about the friendship between Clarice and Betty? <br /> <br />I enjoyed the characters, the life-like feelings of a child about her life.  The illustrations are entertaining.  On some pages the writing streams and swirls around the page.   This is a grand book for children between the ages of 7-10.  Armchair Interviews suggests parents, grandparents read this together with the important children in their lives.  It will be a wonderful time spent together. <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-07-24

I thoroughly enjoyed his two previous novels, Flabbergasted and A Delirious Summer. And with Lost in Rooville Blackston came through again with another great summer (or anytime) read. <br />  <br />This time Jay, Allie, Steve and Darcy (from the previous books) team up for \\"the adventure of a lifetime\\" down under in Australia. <br />  <br />Steve and Jay take their girlfriends in separate Land Cruisers deep into the arid plains of Australia, with proposals of marriage on their minds.  Little did Jay know what he had gotten himself into.  There are mishaps that include a near-death experience, time in an Australian jail cell, and a debt so large he has to go back to South Carolina to work, all of which bring him to test his faith in God. <br />  <br />As I finished the story, I felt sad that this was the final book in the series. I'm going to miss them and would love to keep looking in on the lives of these lovable, quirky characters.  It is my sincere hope that Ray Blackston would consider continuing with this wonderful series. <br /> <br />	2005-07-24

Rushmore \\"Mac\\" McKenzie is a former St. Paul Police officer who became wealthy when he left the force to accept a three-million-dollar bounty on an embezzler. He may be retired but he manages to keep busy helping friends in trouble.    Mr. Mosley, a beekeeper and an elderly family friend, wants Mac to help him find out why his bees are dying. Mac agrees to look into the problem with the help of the entomology department at the University of Minnesota. When the graduate student who is taking soil samples is shot at, Mac and Mosley drive to the scene and are confronted by a large man with an even-larger shotgun.    Mac and Mosley ask an attorney friend to send a threatening letter to the man who assaulted them verbally and physically. Violence erupts when the lawyer's wife is raped and Mosley is murdered. Mac becomes determined to track down the responsible person or persons and bring them to justice (whatever justice looks like).    During the investigation, Mac poses as a writer for a magazine titled Trailer Life. Using that cover, he is based in a tiny Twin Cities municipality called Hilltop. He uncovers a rogue FBI agent with a songwriter wife, Penelope (whom Mac falls \\"a little bit\\" in love with) and a mobster on the run from the mob.    What started as a simple investigation into dying honeybees may cost Mac a lot-maybe his own life, or someone he cares about.    David Housewright, author of Tin City is one of my favorite mystery writers. He is almost pitch perfect in plot, characterization, motivation and pacing. His ability to articulate the feel of the Twin Cities might be expected since he lives there, but I think it's more than that. It's what I call \\"the touch.\\" Others that have it are Dennis Lehane, Michael Connelly and Robert Crais. Simply put, I'd read a cereal box if David Housewright wrote it.    That said, I have one criticism. I read mysteries to be entertained. I found the author's inclusion of what I took to be a personal political statement distracting. I'm weary of folks using their public access as a political platform, even if I happen to agree with them. And I don't look for things to offend me; this found me.	2005-07-22

Jack leaves a personal growth seminar for a lunch break. He's holding his life together, but a divorce appears imminent, which means he's going to lose his wife and children. He stops at Starbucks and while waiting to place his order he has a phone call from his wife. There are problems with the kids-and Jack assumes the conversation is about making the problems his fault. And there's one other thing she wants to say, but bad reception ends the call. <br /> <br />Sitting on the patio with his latte he studies the people around him-people watching is his past time. There's the one-legged black woman named Millie whom he bumped, then ignored on the way to the patio. She's working a crossword puzzle. There's Elliott, a young geek-type furiously and delightedly typing away on his computer. And then there's Alexis, a young lawyer with her now-retired philosophy professor, Sean Stanton. <br /> <br />A truck loses control, crashes through the patio into the brick wall that then cascades down, killing everyone. And life as the five people know it is over. Nate shows up to be their guide to the two doors-one choice leading up to heaven, the other to hell. On the way to the doors they each get to revisit portions of their lives and the choices they've made, choices determining which of the two doors will open. <br /> <br />Bolin writes in a crisp, interesting manner. An interesting addition to the book is a follow-up conversation that has Bolin discussing the book as a possible Hollywood film with a studio exec, Chris. This allows us to get the back story on each of the characters-and a very clear picture of what each of us must do on this side of death to have the door to heaven be our choice after death. Armchair Interviews says: Thought-provoking discussion questions accompany each chapter and make this book and excellent choice for a small group study. <br />	2005-07-22

Baldwin Hills is a middle-class Los Angeles neighborhood inhabited by African-Americans, including Dr. Byron Williams. On his way home from work one day, and not understanding why, meticulous Byron picks up a homeless man he calls \\"bagman\\" and brings him to his neighborhood. After Byron drops the \\"bagman\\" off he goes home to find his wife giving birth to a male child. The frightening part of this situation is that Byron's wife wasn't pregnant when he left for work that morning. Following the child's birth, \\"bagman\\" calmly walks into the Williams house, takes the infant and leaves with it in a bag. Byron's wife immediately forgets what has happened but Byron does not. <br /> <br />Cecil \\"Ceese\\" Tucker is resisting the lure of the streets but is not always successful. While going to smoke \\"weed\\" with his friend Raymo, he finds the baby in the bag and brings the baby to his neighbor Ura Lee Smitcher, who is a nurse. She ultimately takes in the child. <br /> <br />The baby, now called Mack Street, grows into a loner who is loved by everyone in the neighborhood. He realizes that he is different and interesting things happen when the desires of others seep into his own dreams. Mack is the only one that can see, through a tiny slice of space, a house-the entrance to an extraordinary world of magic. A battle between good and evil ensues in the real world and the world of fairies, and Mack, if he is successful, will ultimately have his own questions answered. <br /> <br />I've enjoyed reading Orson Scott Card's novels in the past and was excited to delve into Magic Street. It wasn't however, one of my favorites. I found the black dialogue stilted and occasionally distracting. I think part of my problem was that the story was a modern-day, urban fantasy and I'm not as fond of that. Armchair Interviews says it was a slow-building story but we would suggest that people keep reading as the characters are well-developed and the plot is ultimately intriguing. <br />	2005-07-22

As the youngest of three daughters, she feels she's an embarrassment to her family-not just because of her facial scars or deviant behavior, but because she never says the right thing and doesn't hold to the family's religious \\"babble.\\" She avoids her family and finds comfort in nearly all lost causes like stray animals, the Atlanta Braves and emotionally-scarred neighbors.    The Dwelling Place is her unraveling of her family history-an assignment from rehab. But it's a more mature telling of the story than the immature and rebellious Ellie we meet in chapter one. Her assignment is completed only after an intense summer dealing with her mother and caring for her during chemotherapy's awful aftermath.    Ellie has spent the last several years of her life despising her parents for what they let happen to her as a child. Her bitterness and feelings of betrayal have caused her to build additional walls with her parents and sisters. And her assumptions of their \\"perfect\\"\\" lives make her feel like even more of an outcast-because the hell she's been through has left her anything but perfect.    Musser does an incredible job of involving the reader. The writing is conversational-where you feel a part of the story naturally. The unfolding of the story is seamless; Musser grabs the reader from the second sentence of the prologue when she hints at scandal. Ellie is a narrator one can relate to-the emotions felt of betrayal, unhappiness, and insecurity. The conflict between perception versus reality and the unveiling of truth is so well done in this novel. The characterizations make you care and cry and the research makes the book that much more fascinating and personal. I was really impressed with The Dwelling Place and plan on reading Musser's first book, The Swan House.	2005-07-22

While cutting the turf, Brendan McGann literally uncovers the perfectly preserved head of a red-haired woman, in a peat bog located on his farm in County Galway, Ireland. <br /> <br />Cormac Maguire, an archeologist and faculty member at the University of Dublin; Nora Gavin, an American lecturing at Trinity College; and Garret Devaney, a local detective, investigate the gruesome find. This body could be a recent death or one that has gone undetected for centuries, given the preservation abilities of peat bogs. <br /> <br />Nora is both drawn to and repelled by the find. As a scientist she is excited about the potential information that the head could yield, but is also disturbed by the reminder of her own sister's death. Cormac continues to mourn the loss of his friend and colleague, Gabriel McCrossan. It is to be his first trip into the field without McCrossan. Garret Devaney is there to determine if a crime has been committed. <br /> <br />While in County Galway, Nora and Cormac are hired by Hugh Osborne, primary suspect in the disappearance of his wife and young son some two years previous, to do an archaeological survey on a construction site. Nora and Cormac agree to stay at Osborne's manor, Bracklyn House. There they meet Osborne's cousin Lucy, an odd woman, who is Hugh's housekeeper and Lucy's troubled 17-year-old son, Jeremy. <br /> <br />Disturbing things occur at Bracklyn House during Nora and Cormac's stay, an attraction between the two develops, the investigation into the history of the preserved head takes twists and turns-and the mystery of the disappearance of Hugh's wife and son takes center stage. <br /> <br />Haunted Ground by Erin Hart is a riveting debut mystery. It is written with an intensity and fluidity that begs to be read slowly and savored because it is not just a grand story but because it is filled with interesting information about Celtic culture and folklore, Irish music and history. <br /> <br />I can't wait to read Lake of Sorrows and I highly recommend Haunted Ground. <br />	2005-07-10

Hughes has won four Daytime Emmys between 1990 and 2002 and many Soap Opera Digest awards for her roles in General Hospital (1990-2002) and All My Children (1999-2003). She is currently the host of How Do I Look? on the Style Network. <br /> <br />Kate McPhee flees London and a betrayal by her lover and best friend, to work on a soap opera in Los Angeles. Her character on Live for Tomorrow is Devon Merrick, and she is a cop. The script writers want her played in an edgy, hard way, with the possibility that she may be gay. <br /> <br />The book is a bit confusing at times with literary asides from Alice in Wonderland, script excerpts, and odd bits of dialogue, but you get used to the pace, which mimics the pace of Kate's insanely busy life. <br /> <br />Kate's inability to relate to the bitchy, matriarchal \\"star\\" of the soap, and the pneumatic California \\"Barbies\\" who are sprinkled through the cast, make it difficult for her. She finds friends among the make-up artists and crew, and eventually finds time to make friends in the \\"real\\" world. <br /> <br />You will enjoy Kate's growing fame, and her crazy situations, such as showing up at the Daytime Emmy award show in the same dress as her soap's star, who demands she go back to the hotel and change. This causes Kate to miss accepting her award when she wins! <br /> <br />One aside: I did dislike Kate's constant self-image problems when comparing herself to the tall, thin, and stacked young female colleagues. She imagines herself huge, with various rather gross attributes getting worse by the minute. This fades as the story progresses and as Kate realizes she has talents that the others do not possess.	2005-07-10

Nothing is ever as it seems, security is a slender thread broken when we first realize it doesn't really exist, and as Thomas H.

So when his son Keith baby sits for eight-year-old Amy Giordano and she disappears, Eric's watches, stunned, as his life spirals out of control and smashes headlong into the reality of his present and his past. <br /> <br />As suspicion of Keith's involvement in Amy's disappearance grows, Eric and his wife Meredith continue to publicly support and believe in his innocence. Silently they are filled with a growing suspicion that their only child might have been involved. <br /> <br />Eric's suspicion leads him back to his own dysfunctional family where his father took them from considerable wealth that included private schools, to near bankruptcy, his mother committed suicide, his sister died of a brain tumor and his brother is a near-do-well alcoholic whose shocking addictions are just now coming to light. <br /> <br />The ending is unexpected but satisfying. Red Leaves is one man's determination to hold onto a fragile world of what he knows and what is his. It's a story that will leave you asking yourself, do you really ever know anyone, even yourself? <br /> <br />I am a fan of Thomas H. Cook. His prose is direct and sparse with just the right amount of description; no more, no less. It contributes to a grand crime read. <br />	2005-07-10

Once I began, it was difficult to put down. <br /> <br />The novel switches between the story about the rise of Everett Lester and his rock band DeathStroke; letters from a young woman who feels called to help the band's leader receive salvation; and real time where the leader, who is accused of murder, is living the story he's been asked to write by a New York publishing house. <br /> <br />Everett, an abused kid, used music to escape his troubled home life. Then he and his garage band hit the 'big time' where everything worldly (good and bad) is within his reach. There is alcohol, drugs and a life that is void of purpose and generally empty. People prey on Everett and a young woman in Kansas who prays for Everett as he fights his own spiritual battle, one that is literally being waged for his soul as he is on trial for the murder of Endora, his personal psychic. <br /> <br />Dark Star is a wonderful book. It may not be for everyone but I'd suggest giving it a chance. The writing style is compelling, the characters real and complex. But what hit me is the message of faith, hope and love-the love of everyone, even the lost. Especially the lost. It is the battle between God and Satan for the soul of a man. Give this book a read. <br />	2005-07-10

Kate Connor's day is on a downhill spiral. Her two-year-old son knocked over a stack of Fancy Feast cat food in Wal-Mart, she has scads of errands to run and no time, and her second husband Stuart springs an impromptu dinner party for eight at their home on her, with just a few hours notice. The codicil to Stuart's request for her culinary services (which are lacking) is that the dinner party could make or break Stuart's political aspirations.  <br /> <br />Kate later rationalized that her hectic life was the reason she didn't immediately notice the demon stalking her as she completed her domestic rounds. Unfortunately the demon did get her attention an hour after she returned home, when he crashed through her kitchen window and tried to kill her.  <br /> <br />It seems that Kate has a body to hide, a mess to clean up, a dinner party to pull off and a secret to hide from her husband and children. And all the while she's worried that the demon didn't travel alone. It seems that retirement and life as a stay-at-home soccer mom is over. Kate Connor is going back to work, whether she wants to or not.  <br /> <br />Think Buffy all grown up and you have feisty and determined Kate Conner. She must find high demon Goramesh, learn what he's looking for and why he came to demon-free San Diablo, California - and then snuff out his life. If she doesn't, her life, the lives of her family and the world could be in danger.  <br /> <br />Julie Kenner's Carpe Demon: Adventures of a Demon-Hunting Soccer Mom is a hilarious romp through the life of desperate, demon hunter housewife, Kate Conner.

The subtitle of On American Soil says it all: Murder, the Military, and How Justice Became a Casualty of World War II. Seattle journalist James Hamman stumbled onto \\"a story\\" 18 years ago about an Italian soldier dying while in a prisoner of war camp in Seattle-and finally wrote the story when the documents were declassified. <br /> <br />Some Italian soldiers had been captured after years of toiling under Fascist rule, fighting without buying into the politics. Over 200 of the POWs, those who were not troublemakers, were moved to a camp near Seattle. These prisoners made up the Italian Service Unit (ISU) where they did the work of American soldiers, dressed in plain uniforms. <br /> <br />The Italians were allowed to go into town to visit Italian-American homes for a family dinner. Also in this encampment were the black soldiers, whose primary job was loading and unloading ships (thus called Port soldiers). A small scuffle ensued one night after three Italians returned to the camp. The black soldiers were furious with how poorly they were treated as American soldiers-and the privileges the POWS had. <br /> <br />The alarm went out to deal with the Italians who had hurt \\"one of our boys.\\" A riot ensured for almost an hour, without MPs arriving, and violence was meted out without discerning if they were badly beating Italian or American soldiers. <br /> <br />The camp commander was so embarrassed by the riot-and lack of response by the MPs, that he ordered everything cleaned up immediately-removing fingerprints and other evidence needed to deal with the intruding soldiers. More than 40 black soldiers were charged for the riot. <br /> <br />On American Soil becomes the story of how one Italian POW was found hung. At first it was ruled a suicide, unlikely as that seemed as there were no footprints under his body. As this was August 1944, in the midst of the war, any mistreatment of POWs on our land could mean more mistreatment of captured Americans. Someone had to pay...and that leads up to a trial prosecuted by Leon Jaworski (later of the Nuremberg Trials, Kennedy's assassination and Nixon's impeachment fame). <br /> <br />I'm not going to reveal anything else. It is a fabulous read and would make a great movie-if we really wanted to know a true but unbelievable story of segregation, POWs, wartime problems here and abroad, ineptness of commanders-the list goes on. <br /> <br />The author has done a thorough job of research and On American Soil is a two-thumbs-up book. <br />	2005-07-10

When they're released the next morning Jim has an uneasy feeling. They're so anxious to leave that they skip the free breakfast. <br /> <br />Two weeks later Nightingale returns to Blanchard to find the bank has been robbed by drifters riding horses that match the ones the rowdies rode out of Silver City.

But that didn't prevent her from going dateless to her reception, dancing on a table and ending up a New York news story. Then reality smacks her in the pocketbook. Without a husband and a job, she can't afford the apartment she's living in on the upper east side and doesn't know where her next meal is coming from. <br /> <br />Isabelle takes a job at Becky Belden Multimedia where the corporate culture is perky and creepy at the same time. Becky Belden, the creator and head of BBM is a Martha Stewart-like clone. Soon after joining the BBM family, Isabelle discovers that employees are dropping dead like flies. See Isabelle run as she becomes the next target for the killer. <br /> <br />This is a witty, well-written read. I must admit that I stayed up far too late finishing it. But that's a good thing. Elizabeth Bloom should only get better with subsequent books. If you want a fast, fun read, See Isabelle Run might just be what you're looking for. <br />	2005-07-02

He is one day from being engaged-and one week from getting the coveted vice president slot. He overhears his girlfriend having rough sex when her cell phone is accidentally turned on. This drives him to drink in a cabaret with Anna, a Russian prostitute, and later to be thrown from a three-story window. <br /> <br />He wakens from the fall thinking in strange ways, believing he has strange powers. He learns Anna and the bouncer are dead, the cabaret has been closed and the owner has disappeared. And no one can find any trace of the hospital he was in or the doctor that saved his life. <br /> <br />And to top that off, he now hears things and knows things like he is being followed though he can't see anyone. Then there is the field of some sort, filled with particles and points of light. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, in parallel time, Mike McBride is chief physicist for a $12 billion dollar super-collider project in Texas. He meets a news anchor, Kelly Smith, and is captivated by her beauty, wit and intelligence. They talk about Higgs Field that contains the God Particle he's trying to find. She becomes the catalyst to bring the storylines together. <br /> <br />The God Particle moves between Mike and Steve who's trying to understand what's happened to him and why. Mike is trying to deal with the politics of science, sabotage, and a best friend who is jealous of Mike's success-and is a sexual addict who is losing touch with reality and sabotaging their project. <br /> <br />Some readers will wonder why the sex scenes are necessary and others will find the easy dismissal of biblical faith disturbing. Some will be fascinated by how two sets of characters and two story lines are drawn together and merged into one. Others will find that all the scientific talk hurts their heads and they just want to stop thinking about it. Hardly anyone will finish the book without strong feelings about what they have read. <br />	2005-06-29

Do you have to make yourself breathe during the chase scenes in a suspense movie? Do you dream of foiling every bad guy you've ever met, and those you haven't come in contact with yet? If you've answered yes to these questions, you can find all that and more in Vicki Hinze's books. Her Body Double is so exciting you should have your doctor give your heart a medical pass before you read it. <br /> <br />Amanda West isn't fazed by the torture she's received at the hands of Thomas Kunz' henchmen. That was because she'd been tortured by the best as a child: her own father. Torture didn't work so Kunz believes that he can conquer Amanda by burying her alive in a brick and mortar tomb. He's underestimated Amanda. <br /> <br />Amanda is a Special Forces captain who learns, following her escape from the tomb, that she's been captured and missing for three months. Her capture jeopardizes her career. But there have been other missing persons, and it's ultimately up to Amanda to get to the bottom of the kidnappings in order to protect the Unites States. <br /> <br />Amanda's investigation leads her to another agent in search of the same answers. They learn that the unthinkable has happened. Someone is creating doubles of government agents, and the only man Amanda has ever trusted, might not be who she thought he was. And her survival might be at stake. <br /> <br />Body Double is suspense to the max! I can't wait to read the next Vicki Hinze book. I've got a whole new genre to enjoy now. I have an enormous amount of respect for Hinze's ability to conjure up a scintillating read. <br />	2005-06-29

Tamara Britton works for the Care for Kids Agency in the Stabilization Division of the child protective unit. The translation is: Services to help at-risk families and their vulnerable children. <br /> <br />Sienna, a runaway teen who is awaiting foster care placement-and happens to have an attitude and a foul mouth-comes to stay with Tamara. It's a cinch life is about to spiral out of control for the dedicated social worker. Trouble is \\"riding shotgun\\" and with a challenging teen that is expected. What Tamara didn't expect was that she would begin looking into her own past. And with her exploration, Tamara learns that she can embrace life. <br /> <br />While we're on the ride with this twosome, we watch and root for them as they learn to care for each other in a way they didn't expect, and also grow in their relationship with God in ways they didn't realize they could. <br /> <br />I enjoyed Cheri Paris Edwards debut novel, Plenty Good Room. There was some predictability but somehow that didn't detract; it made it somehow nice and easy. Warm, funny, loving moments were added as well as a hint of some mystery in Tamara's background and a bit of romance to light the way. I believe Edwards has a good many other stories to tell, and you'll want to be in on the read. <br />	2005-06-29

Sandra Scoppettone has hit on a wonderfully unique idea in her newest novel, This Dame For Hire. <br /> <br />Faye Quick is a bright, able- bodied, not to mention, gutsy woman. It's 1943 and Faye is working for a sleazy PI, Woody Mason, who heads off to WWII. And it's up to Faye to step up and take the reins of the A Detective Agency so the boss has a business to come home to after the war ends.  <br /> <br />It wasn't a surprise to Faye when Mr. & Mrs. West entered her office wanting to hire her. After all, Faye had been the one to find their daughter's dead body on a Greenwich Village sidewalk. And now she's determined to solve the murder of the well-to-do NYU student and Park Avenue resident.  <br /> <br />The novel's tone, Faye's tough and feisty attitude, the dialogue and the sense of time all contribute to the feel of 1943 New York in this suspense novel. I only hope it's the first of many Faye Quick adventures because I will faithfully follow her as she traipses through the sordid and steamy underbelly of New York City in the 1940s. This Dame For Hire was better than an 'old' movie, a bowl of popcorn and a rainy Saturday night (which would be nirvana for me). It will be for other mystery lovers also.  <br />	2005-06-29

Dale Cramer, author of Levi's Will, proves himself a master storyteller with an obvious passion for \\"getting it right.\\" His prose is beautiful and his characters are drawn so realistically that you will believe you've known them forever. And when the story concludes, you'll realize you've grown to love them all, even the difficult ones, and you won't want to say good-bye. <br /> <br />Will Mullet is 19 when he flees Ohio, his Amish family and the girl he got pregnant. He enlists in the military, meets Helen and marries her, has two sons and settles down to live as if he had no past. But his Amish life catches up with him and he's forced to tell his wife the truth, which includes his father's unrelenting judgment of him, the Amish ban and the child he left behind. <br /> <br />Will's father is rigid, extremely harsh and slow to allow the prodigal son back into the fold. Only when Will \\"let's go\\" and forgives his father, does his father begin his own acceptance of Will and allow him to come home again. <br /> <br />The tragedy of pride, which kept a family separated and seeped into the next generation, broke my heart. The process of forgiveness and healing lifted me up and gave me hope. And love... the proof of God made my heart sing. <br /> <br />Cramer deftly weave's Will story between their Amish world and our world and travels between time periods with ease. And he introduces the reader to a world we are curious about but that as outsiders, we rarely are allowed to visit. <br /> <br />Levi's Will has joined my 2005 top ten list of favorite novels. <br />	2005-06-29

His brother Shannon is a reformed gunslinger turned rancher and sawmill owner who lives in Forest Hill, Oregon with his new wife Judith, and their soon-to-be-born child. Since drawing down on a gunslinger-turned-gambler named Simon Tolliver who was corrupting his town, he promised his wife he'll never use his guns again. <br /> <br />Patrick receives a letter from their Uncle Ethan who lives in Sundown, New Mexico. Two crooked businessmen, Culpepper and Keene, are pressuring the ranchers to sell their land. Uncle Ethan believes there will be trouble and asks Patrick for help. <br /> <br />Patrick arrives in Sundown to find Uncle Ethan dead and the town has been intimidated into submission by hire guns. Meanwhile Simon Tolliver's relatives show up in Forest City to call out Shannon and avenge Simon's death. Shannon intends to keep his promise and refuses to put his guns back on. <br /> <br />Edmond Burke, renowned member of England's parliament during the American Revolution said: \\"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\\" The rest of the book shows what happens when good men decide to do something. The people of Forest Hill decide that Shannon's problem is their problem-and Shannon comes to his brother's aid. <br /> <br />This book is holds your attention and is refreshing because there is a clear-cut sense of what is right and what is wrong. It also shows that people can realize they've made bad choices and can do something about them. <br />	2005-06-29

Her husband Rob died violently and Bay experienced a summer of treachery and deceit that resulted in the death of a man with whom she had been close to at one time. And to keep herself and those she loves safe, she's dabbling in blackmail.  <br /> <br />Just when Bay believes her life is settling into a reasonable facsimile of normalcy, Cart Anderson, son of Geoffrey Anderson (the man who died during the summer of treachery) confronts Bay about the death of his father. Bay and Alain Darnay (Bay's French romantic interest and an Interpol agent) have questions of their own for Cart. After they question him, he disappears. When Cart's car is found on St. Helena Island with blood inside, Bay and Alain are looking good for his murderer. And Bay's family connections (her father is a retired Judge) mean nothing.  <br /> <br />Bay and Alain begin searching for answers to Cart's disappearance just as another murder takes place. Minnie Maude Bleeker is killed shortly after Bay and Alain visit her cabin with questions about Cart and the St. Helena fort.  <br /> <br />When Alain 'takes a powder,' Bay asks her former investigative partner, Erik Whiteside and Gabby Henson, a local reporter, for help. The plot that begins unraveling could mean serious trouble for Bay, so serious, it could get her sent to prison or worse yet, killed.  <br /> <br />Kathryn R. Wall's Resurrection Road is a fast-paced, thrilling ride into the life and personalities of its South Carolina residents. The tension is as heavy as the thick, muggy summer Hilton Head heat and the excitement is one continuous roller coaster ride. I haven't read any of Wall's previous works but I will. I am definitely a new fan.  <br />	2005-06-25

When I read, I read primarily for enjoyment. It's always a bonus if a book can truly touch my heart and make me smile, laugh, cry or just plain feel deeply about the characters and their circumstances. Morris has accomplished all of that and more.  <br /> <br />It's 1958 in Los Angeles and eight-year-old Wade Parker's baby brother died. Wade's mother, Lucinda (he refers to his mother by her first name), is so grief struck that she's distanced herself from her two living children. And Earl, Wade's alcoholic father, has abdicated his parental responsibilities. To compensate for his parents' emotional and physical absence, Wade dreams (throughout the novel) that Duke Snyder, the Dodgers ballplayer, is his father. And he fantasizes what life would be like with Duke as dad.  <br /> <br />One early morning, Wade and Luke, his six-year-old brother, take a journey to nearby Billy Goat Hill to slide down on cardboard (a poor kid's version of bobsledding). While Wade and Luke are waiting for another sledder to arrive and tackle the hill with them, they meet a man and woman and witness what they believe is a confrontation between a motorcycle gang and the police. Thus begins Wade's journey from childhood, as a vulnerable \\"lost\\" kid, to an adult man of God.  <br /> <br />Billy Goat Hill allowed me to slip back in time, to an era that was simpler, but no less difficult because it's all about life and life is filled with drama, tragedy, humor and adventure. Morris' wonderfully complex, fully developed characters and rich prose is delightful. And the message of forgiveness and redemption left me feeling hopeful and satisfied.  <br /> <br />Billy Goat Hill is a treasure waiting to be savored. The only regret that I have about this book is because it is labeled 'Christian Fiction' many people may pass on reading it and that would be a tragedy.  <br />	2005-06-25

For many of us, life is spinning out of control. We are juggling a myriad of relationships, jobs, errands and activities every day of our lives. Keri Wyatt Kent, author of Breathe: Creating Space for God in a Hectic Life, says, \\"Many moms don't realize that their value is found not in what they do, but in who they are.\\" She suggests if that statement fits you, you would do well to stand back, take some time for a break ... and breathe. And while Kent specifically talks about and to moms, I believe that Breathe could benefit men and women of any age because our society is one of busyness, overfilled with activity.  <br /> <br />Kent combines personal stories and scripture. These stories encourage us all to slow down, rest, grow spiritually and make room for God. She includes breathing exercises, and she tells us how we can live intentionally, keep the Sabbath, eliminate worry. She gives specific steps to simplicity and freedom, and so very much more. This book is chock full of specific steps to simplicity and freedom, and wonderful, simple and logical help.  <br /> <br />Breathe has helped me to press the \\"pause button\\" - to think, listen, hear, feel and to make time for me and mine. I'm \\"smelling the roses\\" more these days, and it's because of Keri Wyatt Kent's timely book Breathe. Hey, no more whirling dervish for me! I highly recommends this book if you truly want to slow down and simplify your life.  <br />	2005-06-25

An incredibly interesting and wildly fun - and I must admit truly accurate book - found me recently. It is Gail M. Hayes' book, Daughters of the King.  <br /> <br />Hayes believes that every woman has her own unique sense of style that is not only how she dresses but also how she does things (like holding an eating utensil or how she thinks). It is her very essence. It is simply who women are in the world and as children of God.  <br /> <br />Hayes presents a simple twelve-question image indicator, and from the answers can tell women what type they are; Jaunty Esprit, Harmonic Refined, Elegant Flamboyant, Creative Poetic, Chantilly Graceful or Sensual Exotic. Now you might scoff or even laugh at the thought that a short questionnaire can pinpoint style, but I must confess that when I took the test, it was so accurate it shocked me. And no, I'm not going to share my style. I'd like to quietly savor it for awhile before proclaiming it to everyone.  <br /> <br />Once you have determined your style, Hayes discusses in depth the beauty of your unique style, the inner you, tells a biblical story, discuses your style and family life, your strengths in the body of Christ, working style, good career choices, color and clothing and jewelry choices, as well as make up and hair styles.  <br /> <br />I absolutely love this book because it's fun, it explains my style personally and as a child of God. And because it is, as I said before, so accurate! Women, buy this book, share it with your daughter, friends and anyone who will listen. I see style parties cropping up all over the country.  \\"What fun!\\"  <br />	2005-06-25

Trouble seems to follow him and he uses the investigative genes he got from his policeman father to figure out the who, what, when, where, whys and hows. The investigative skills he's grateful for, however - his father he can do without.  <br /> <br />Dad believes he should have done something honorable with his life - like be a cop. And golf is a waste of time. Being an Open Champion means less than nothing to good ole' dad. Meanwhile, Alan has an ex-wife named Rosemary, with whom he has a love-hate relationship with (more hate than love); a teenage daughter named Lynette who he adores; a current love named Fiona that he wants to keep in his life; a journalist, Clive Phelps, who promotes him just as much today as when he won the Open; a recreational vehicle named Carnoustie (after the site of his Open victory); and a string of dead bodies littering his attempt to win the Open at St. Andrews Old Course this year.  <br /> <br />Saxon hasn't been on form for a while, but this might be his year. But someone doesn't want it to be. He gives a lovely young hitchhiker a ride on his way to St. Andrews - and three days later she's murdered. His caddie stays off the sauce long enough to help Saxon mount a charge in the first two rounds - and then is almost killed to keep him from continuing his march.  <br /> <br />Saxon spends almost as much time being interviewed by the police as he does the press. And his disdain for his father comes across as a reluctance to cooperate with the local constabulary. And Saxon's penchant for investigating, when he should be informing the police, doesn't sit well with them either, especially when they think he's either the killer - or the real target.  <br /> <br />Miles keeps a fast pace as he skillfully weaves the story between rounds of the Open championship, descriptions of key figures in the championship itself, Saxon's personal struggles and investigations, and the politics and economics of big-time golf. Whether you're a golf fan or a murder mystery aficionado there's plenty to keep you engrossed in Bullet Hole.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-25

You know the kind, printed on matte paper, 4- color, with line drawing illustrations.  <br /> <br />This is some of the most hysterically funny writing about books and reading I have ever read. Hornby's heroic struggle with Wilkie Collins' No Name in his Dec. 2003-Jan. 2004 column is described in great detail. He loved the first 200 pages, and based upon that, had recommended it in a previous column. However, he was totally unprepared for the next 418 pages. No Name was one of those Dickens-era serialized novels, and I guess Collins was reluctant to end it.  <br /> <br />Hornby found it hard to feel sympathy for a heroine who might just have to go out and work--gasp! as a governess or something else equally horrible, if her evil relatives do succeed in stealing her inheritance. \\"Wilkie would point out that I unwisely attempted to read the second half of No Name during a trip to L.A. Has anyone ever attempted a Victorian novel in Los Angeles, and if so, why?\\" says Hornby.  <br /> <br />Hornby's journey with books in The Polysyllabic Spree is one of the discoveries of unusually wonderful books, and he includes a few excerpts in this volume.  <br />	2005-06-25

Joshua's father is a minister in her church. And he just happens to be married. Taylor has never told anyone whom Joshua's father is, but when an unexpected job loss occurs, she may be forced to speak his name - if she wants to feed her son.  <br /> <br />Yvonne is a woman who seems to have everything: money, looks, and a long-term marriage that gives the appearance that it is secure. But the problem is that it's all show when Yvonne admits she's married to a man who is abusive, lies and is unfaithful. And she knows the woman with whom he's been unfaithful.  <br /> <br />What a Sista Should Dois Tiffany L. Warren's debut novel. It's a bold and honest look at the frailty of people struggling to do what's right and not always succeeding. It's also about God's grace and forgiveness. It will make you angry, you'll feel sadness and you will be uplifted and filled with hope. It's an intimate look into the lives of three African-American women whose primary strength comes from their faith in God.   <br />	2005-06-25

When the story opens, the war hadn't yet really affected the folks as far north as Michigan. But it's beginning to impact the community now as Caleb Tuttle, husband, father and neighbor, enlists to fight for the Union against the Confederacy.  <br /> <br />Phebe doesn't really understand much of what the war means. All she knows is it's terrifying to think of men dying so far away from home. And when Caleb leaves his family, Phebe pitches in to help Mrs. Tuttle, the interesting eldest son Josiah, and Sarah, her best friend, with both the farm work and the other Tuttle children. This help is a sacrifice for Phebe's family because her infant brother, Benjamin is very ill.  <br /> <br />Just when the Tuttle family fears that Caleb died in the war (because they haven't heard from him since he left home), a message arrives in the form of an escaped slave, Grady. Grady, his wife Maisie and their three children traveled north from Tennessee on the underground railroad with a map from Caleb and permission to stay at the Tuttle farm for the duration of the war.  <br /> <br />During the war Phebe decides that she can contribute to the cause by writing letters to soldiers who are family and friends. Thus begins exchanges that provide support, give much-needed information, and reunites a family.  <br /> <br />There are moments of faith that wind its way between instances of tragic death, new-found freedom, a pregnancy, budding friendship and young love in Janet Elaine Smith's young adult novel My Dear Phebe. It's an enlightening and historical look at the turmoil of the Civil War. Included at the end are the actual letters between the real Phebe and soldiers in the war.

Now her boyfriend, Simon, is experiencing the aftermath of an accident where he feels responsible for the death of a woman and her child. And Tess is unable to help Simon lift himself from the depths of despair. Further complicating matters is the infidelity and ultimately the death of her friend Blair Holbrook's husband.  <br /> <br />People are calling upon Tess to help and support them in their time of need, even when she is unable to reconcile her own tragedy: her mother's untimely death of within minutes of her birth.  <br /> <br />As Simon begins to help himself, Tess embarks on a road trip with Blair to resolve a chapter in their life that occurred fifteen years ago when Tess, Blair and their friend Jewel found a crippled and abandoned newborn baby. While Tess believes that she is helping her friend find peace and closure, Tess is the one who ultimately finds the contentment in God that she has searched for all her life.  <br /> <br />Susan Meissner, author of The Remedy for Regret, is the consummate storyteller who writes with a passion that is felt by the reader both physically and emotionally. I smiled, found myself nodding with understanding, and cried heartfelt tears. Meissner drew me in with an interesting and plausible plot, filled the landscape with inviting and likeable characters and then wove understanding, forgiveness and reconciliation throughout the scenes. She capped the novel off with salvation through God's unconditional love and gave us all hope.  And isn't that what it's all about?  <br />	2005-06-25

Rather than follow the path of successful insterstellar commerce that the family has built through generations, she chooses to attend her planet's Naval Academy. About to graduate near the top of her class, she instead is forced to resign in disgrace when a good deed done for an underclassman is used to embarrass the academy and the space force. This is a pattern for Ky, many of her good deeds - which are truly good, seem to be punished, rather than rewarded.  <br /> <br />The family decides that the media attention is unwanted and solves the problem by putting Ky in charge of one of the family's oldest ships. She is to captain the \\"Glennys Jones\\" on a final trading journey and then sell her for scrap. What Ky doesn't know is that this is a rite of passage that other family members, including her father, have gone through before her.  <br /> <br />Ky's father and uncle are betting that, like family members before her, she will find a way to \\"trade and profit\\" that will enable her to refit the ship, bring her up to standards, and save her from the scrap heap.

And the idea is so simple, yet so unique. Under His Wings, by Joy DeKok and Cristine Bolley, is a devotional with stories about birds!  <br /> <br />The authors, through biblical truths and the collection of bird stories, remind us that like the sparrows in the sky, God will keep us safe and provide for our needs because we're His children.  <br /> <br />The authors offer an illustration of God teaching us in their stories. Following each story they give three points to ponder:  <br /> <br />The Bird Feeder is a bit of wisdom to think about while pondering the story.  <br />The Birdbath section is the biblical truth of God's word and God's promises.  <br />The Birdhouse section reminds us that prayer is the answer and helps us apply the lesson's truth.  <br />Finally, a bonus: For The Birds is a section of practical tips about the birds themselves.  <br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the following stories: Attempted Break-In (which reminds us that our conclusions are not always true), A Lesson in Love (a lesson in deep and abiding love), Cleaning House (which is not what you think), Goldie (the story I needed to hear), and Scout (a reminder that we can all use).  <br /> <br />This is a great book to read and reread. It makes for a gentle way to begin each day.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-25

Award-winning Mary Jo Putney has a second book in her new historical fantasy / romance series. Stolen Magic features the strong female characters and interesting plots that Putney is known for. It's a good read!  <br /> <br />Guardian Simon Malmain sneaks into the castle of a Guardian Lord Drayton, who is being investigated for misusing his power. Simon expects his job to be easy: to announce that Drayton must appear before the Guardian council to answer charges. However, Simon is surprised by the incredibly strong and powerful magic Drayton has when Simon is transformed into a unicorn. He manages to escape, but is later captured by Drayton's men who use a virgin, one of Drayton's simple servants, Meg, to lure him into a trap. Simon is later freed by Meg, who loves horses and is dismayed that she has been used to trap this beautiful and powerful unicorn creature. They escape Drayton's power together, and Simon is returned to his human shape when Meg, who is bleeding, tends to a wound on his leg. Apparently when the blood of a virgin is mixed with his blood, it will turn him back into a human.  <br /> <br />Simon and Meg flee to Lady Bethany's estate, where they are protected by her strong magic, but it is apparent he needs Meg by his side - for he turns into a unicorn whenever he gets angry. They decide on a sham marriage. The catch is that Meg must remain a virgin until Drayton is vanquished - and to say the least, it complicates their intense attraction to each other and adds, as we'd say today, some sexual tension and sizzle.  <br /> <br />Simon also realizes that Meg has her own strong magic, and she has been feeding into Drayton's powers for over ten years. She has no memory of who she is or where she came from. Meg is freed from Drayton's thrall, and Simon releases her from a spell that has changed her appearance. Meg is indeed a brilliant, talented and beautiful magician, if a bit unskilled - and she immediatelybegins to discover and develop her powers.  <br /> <br />If you like magical romance with castles as the setting, you'll really enjoy this book.  <br />	2005-06-25

The long, hot, lazy days of summer are somehow just about perfect for certain books. Making It Up As I Go Along by Maria T. Lennon is one of those.     Saffron Roch, a war correspondent who is passionate about her career, leaves Sierra Leone, Africa for her home state of California after learning that her lover, Oscar, a surgeon with Doctors Without Borders, has been unfaithful. To complicate matters, Saffron is pregnant with the arrogant Oscar's child.     California brings another chapter to Saffron's life. She's a single mother to daughter Halla; her adoptive mother, Heaven, has left her a $10 million estate; her brother Francis seems to accept his disinheritance (or does he?); she's struggling between her love for her child and the loss of her career; and then there's the attraction to another man still in Sierra Leone whose life is in danger.     Saffron left the nerve-wracking and dangerous life of chaos and mayhem in war-torn countries for the equally tension-filled life of changing diapers, breastfeeding and coordinating life with baby in tow. Ultimately Saffron must decide about living the safe everyday life she now has in California - or risk all for what is in Africa.     Making It Up As I Go Along weaves two stories: the humorous one of the life Saffron is living in eccentric California and the other darker, intense and dangerous story of Sierra Leone.     As a mother I could identify with all those feelings Lennon so aptly expressed. I also thought about family, career and the choices we women are required to make about them. It does feel that we are making it up as we go along. This book grabbed me and took me along for a heartwarming ride.	2005-06-25

As the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's (FDLE) best investigator, he's been named to lead an investigation into the disappearance of Dylan Jacobs. Dylan was placed in foster care by the Florida Department of Family Services over six years ago, and he's missing.  <br /> <br />Further investigation reveals that he may have been missing for as long as six years - and now the media is on to this story. Where is Dylan? How could the state have lost him? Who's responsible? John and his team need to find answers - and fast.  <br /> <br />Normally a loving and caring family man, John loses it when a paroled murderer shows up at his home. Nightmares buried for over 30 years come back to haunt him. He refuses to talk to his wife Marie about it, so she begins an investigation of her own and uncovers a story of abuse that makes Dylan's drug-addicted mother look like a saint.  <br /> <br />Mynheir smoothly moves between John's investigation and his own nightmares. Instead of getting close to answers, John's investigation only seems to uncover other crimes, victims, and perpetrators while getting no closer to the truth. And Marie's investigation uncovers a number of reasons for John's nightmares, but her knowledge seems to drive a wedge between her and the man she loves.  <br /> <br />God seems far from this story but is intimately present throughout.

Alan Saxon, the British golf professional and long-ago British Open Champion at Carnoustie is at it again. In the off season of the European Tour he's invited to play in a skins game in Australia. A nice trip, a guaranteed pay check, a chance to escape the fact that his ex-wife (whom he both hates and loves) is about to get remarried (and that the real love of his life, his teenage daughter, Lynette is about to acquire a stepfather), and an expenses paid vacation in a luxury suite are all reasons to play. Being a murder target is a good reason not to play.  <br /> <br />But all is not as it seems. The skins game has been put together because of Diane, the new wife of wealthy Warren Oxley. Oxley sees it as an opportunity to tout the Greenblades Country Club in which he has a substantial investment, as well as a chance to improve his political fortunes. Everyone involved seems to have a reason to use Saxon, not necessarily for his own benefit.  <br /> <br />The event is billed as Australia versus Asia, the U.S., and Great Britain with each competitor chosen to represent his respective part of the world. But before the matches begin, the Australian representative has a nasty car accident - which may not have been an accident. He's replaced with another Australian whom Saxon considers to be a cheat and a disgrace to the game.  <br /> <br />A professional golfer's caddie is as critical to his success as any of the clubs in his bag. And Diane wants to caddie for Alan. This is the last thing Alan wants. But in a casual game of golf he recognizes her abilities and agrees to give her a tryout. All is well until the sixteenth hole when she is kidnapped off the course and a ransom is demanded.  <br /> <br />Saxon feels responsible and other events quickly cause him to realize that someone doesn't want him in this event, much less to be the final winner. He is beaten, shot at, has his clubs stolen and is given to mistrust almost everyone whom he initially has any faith in at all. He also puts at risk almost anyone he has any feelings for - and the more he tries to protect them, the more they seem to become targets.  <br /> <br />How the Skins game turns out, who the real friends and foes are, whether good will truly triumph over evil are all very good reasons to read this installment of the Alan Saxon series.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-25

That act of theft sets off a series of murders - and those murdered had contributed to the capsule.<br /><br />The chief investigator of the crimes, Knox Davis, doesn't have any leads, doesn't know where to start or where to go for answers. Then Nikita Stover appears. Nikita is an FBI agent, who doesn't belong 'in this world,' but is determined to nab the killer as she fights her feelings for this new world and man who resides there. To do what she must do, Nikita finds her life in danger. To make matters worse, it appears that one 'of her own' is after her.<br /><br />I don't normally read paranormal mystery/suspense as it's not easy for me to completely suspend my belief system. But Linda Howard's Killing Time is a novel that makes that easy and enjoyable. Her novel is filled with intrigue, suspense, danger and romance. The characters are complex and the plot twists fascinating. I had to remind myself to breathe occasionally. Killing Time is an enjoyable summer read.	2005-06-17

What happens if what you are doing in your life doesn't seem to be working for you now - and you feel that by your own standards you are failing? What if you are a pastor or layperson doing church work, and the programs and promotions are not working? What if you work extra hard to make it work, at the expense of your family? What happens when you don't like the person that you are becoming?  <br /> <br />You discover something that was always there waiting for you, but seldom taught: \\"As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him.\\" We are saved by grace, so we should walk by grace. But few Christians have heard or understood that message.  <br /> <br />Grace Walk is an encouraging book that brings hope to the heart of every follower of Christ who constantly feels that he or she either doesn't measure up - or will never measure up.  <br /> <br />Grace Walk is a book that shows us how to read the Bible for revelation, not information. It is a book that helps us to understand why it is impossible to live for Christ, but very possible to have Him live in and through us. It teaches us how to come to the place where we have the desire to pray, read the word, and fast. It teaches us that we should not do them, just because we ought to, or because we hope that it will win God's favor, or we want Him to know that we are trying hard to live for Him - but rather because we want to - because we want communion with Him.  <br /> <br />If all this has you scratching your head and thinking that this sounds like a book that will take too much thinking, then think again. For the Christian who feels that he or she is constantly falling short of what God really wants or expects, it is a must read that will bring relief, release, and joy as we understand God's perspective.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

This isn't your ordinary \\"wife-of-celebrity memoir.\\" Deborah King Santana is the daughter of an Irish-English professional woman and an African-American jazz musician, brought up in a sheltered, secure life, with pride in herself and her heritage. Her adult life will be neither sheltered nor secure-and never ordinary.  <br /> <br />Deborah meets Sly Stone as a teenager. She is totally unprepared for his world, but is so charmed and seduced by him, that she enters it, complete with music, drugs, abuse, and shame. When she finally finds the strength to leave him, she soon meets Carlos Santana, already a Grammy-winning rock superstar, and though she tells herself to wait, immediately begins a relationship with him.  <br /> <br />Over three decades as Santana's wife, she'll experience the world of a touring musician, a meditative life with an oppressive guru, unfaithfulness by Santana, three children, near financial ruin, and the exhilaration of starting a successful business. Most important, she discovers the emergence of a sense of herself, and what it means to be true to that self.  <br /> <br />Santana unfolds her story without judgment of the person who made the decisions she did. Santana the writer allows Deborah's understanding of each part of her life to emerge slowly and naturally. As much as is possible when looking back over time, we get a sense of what she felt and experienced as it happened, and then what she did with it.  <br /> <br />Her writing is sensual - the feel of skin, the sense of light, music's blood-level rhythm describe her life intimately. It is also sensible - she looks back on her life not as isolated incidents adding up to something, but as stages of becoming. She describes herself with honesty, and fills the page with adjectives and adverbs, leaving nothing to chance in how we will understand her world. It's not a celebrity memoir at all, but a deep look at what this woman, who happens to be married to a famous man, is made of.  <br /> <br/>This is an excellent read if you want to learn what is like to be part of a famous musician's life-with all its perks and pitfalls.  <br />	2005-06-11

This saying goes double for Mahesh Chavda. He practiced the art of Biblical prayer and fasting for over twenty years before he ever started teaching it. And this practice has born fruit in his life.  <br /> <br />From the improved medical condition of an autistic boy when Chavda was a social worker to miraculous healings and transformed lives by the thousands-his personal experience demonstrates that prayer and fasting works: that God brings into partnership with Him those who join Him in this way.  <br /> <br />Chavda teaches that the Bible is clear that the overcoming believer is one who both prays and fasts - yet fasting on anything resembling a regular basis has all but disappeared from most groups of believers. Chavda believes prayer and fasting is a lifestyle God dearly wants for all believers, and that it is one that God blesses. Those blessings do not necessarily flow to the person practicing prayer and fasting (God does not have a frequent prayer and fasting rewards program!), but rather unleashes God's blessings on those for whom we pray and fast. <br /> <br />This book is filled not only with dozens of real-life examples of the results of prayer and fasting, but also serves as a very practical guide of how to do it. This book is not a casual read. The reader will be challenged to look into the mirror of God's word and examine their own accountability for participating in this heavenly calling. <br /> <br />But for those who want to be inspired to live on a different level and want to appropriate God's power to change their lives, their cities, and their nations - this book is an excellent choice. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

The unknown horror of Amaryllis' rape has seeped into every aspect of Calla's life, often paralyzing her in her own responses to life and even limits her ability to experience and enjoy living.  <br /> <br />Calla, a trial consultant in Tucson, Arizona, will only work on civil cases because she's unable to face the criminals, like the man who raped Amaryllis, who slither through the system with a staggering regularity. When Calla's employer demands that she join the defense team for accused rapist and murderer Raymond Cates, a wealthy local man, the memories of Amaryllis' rape collide with the similarities of her current case. Calla begins a journey for answers and to avenge the forcing of Amaryllis.  <br /> <br />Louise Ure, author of Forcing Amaryllis, has written a haunting dessert story of vengeance that is coupled with Calla's personal awakening. The premise that Calla's first-ever criminal trial defendant is her sister's rapist is a bit of a stretch. But if you're in for a good ride and don't mind suspending your belief system occasionally, this book will provide you with enough suspense to keep you going and make you want more. I do hope that this is only the first of a series of Calla Gentry novels. I think Louise Ure will only get better with each novel  <br />	2005-06-11

She writes in fragments, leaving yawning gaps for us to bridge in this new territory. At least, for me, her poetry is new territory. For one who is most familiar with narrative, lyrical poetry, Lauterback's work in Hum is not easy. But like the children's book, Where is Waldo, when you find Elmo, when you find the phrase that makes the connection, you feel like you have found the pot of gold at the end of the journey.  <br /> <br />Her imagery is sometimes startling, sometimes exquisitely beautiful, and sometimes brutal. In the poem \\"Luck\\" she says \\"The day, you see, Huge, like Texas. Then she describes the stillness of birds in the presence of a hawk:  <br /> <br />\\"The small birds were still <br />as without life <br />to escape the eye of the hawk.\\"  <br />She again talks of the hugeness of Texas, like Bach, only this time she refers to the motion of Bach's music as never still but seems \\"as if out of the earth's orbit.\\" She ends the poem with the statement \\"The thing in the sky broke up,\\" referring I believe to the shuttle breaking up over Texas. She goes from hawks to Bach to the tragedy of the shuttle on that clear, large day in Texas.  <br /> <br />Many of the poems in Hum reference music, writers and other art forms. Part of the journey is looking up these references and learning about other artists and their work. In the section of the book called 'Impossible Blue,' she references the painter, Giotto, Memento Mori (Berlin), and Emily Dickenson. She dedicates her poems to other poet-writer-painter-critics such as Michael Brenson, Norma Cole and Garrett Kalleberg. The poems and the dedication move one to explore other poetic terrains.  <br /> <br />Lauderback's work in Hum is not easy for those of us who are not familiar with this experimental form of writing. It is full of fragments of thought, image, and asides both on the page and when spoken. I found that reading her out loud gave me the best sense of her work. It is experimental contemporary poetry. It is brutal. It is beautiful. And it is most satisfying to traverse this new terrain.  <br />	2005-06-11

Its focus is on coaching, versus performance appraisal. The authors contend that the average performance appraisal is like a trip to the dentist - once a year, dreaded, and often too late to catch problems.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, coaching can be \\"just in time\\" and focused on supporting people to be great, rather that correcting them for not becoming all that they can be. Formula 2+2 is the story of Paula, a potentially great manager, who is mentored by Audrey to implement the 2+2 formula, rather than focusing on performance appraisals. The book provides how-to's for the five keys to being a great coach: timeliness, balance, focus, specificity and follow-up.  <br /> <br />These fundamentals give the key for providing the instant course correction and frequent feedback that is so necessary in today's fast-paced business environment. This affords a significant competitive advantage over managers who rely on the stiff, formal, all-too-infrequent performance appraisal that is often looked at as punishment - and a report card.  <br /> <br />The book's goal is to help managers and employees alike view feedback as a positive, joyous experience. Formula 2 + 2 couples the giving of two compliments along with two suggestions for improvement, and it ties this formula into the five keys listed above. Good managers will easily leverage the information into significant results for their teams. Average managers will find that applying these techniques helps them stay managers by enabling them to do a job that they were quite possibly struggling with - and wondering if it would ever get better.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

Greenberg's daughter suffers life-threatening injuries while in Australia. The author rushes to her daughter's hospital bed, hoping against all hope that she will survive. And what starts as a mother's response to a crisis, leads to endings and beginnings that she could not imagine. <br /> <br />Barb Greenberg's memoir Hope Grew Round Me is not only the moving and poignant story of one woman's family crisis, it is the author's journey in learning how to be an authentic person.  <br /> <br />Hope Grew Round Me teaches us to ask the important questions and gives us permission to take the time to answer those questions. We see how Greenberg helps her family to live through a crisis, how she learns to tear down the artificial boundaries she lives by, and how she sets new boundaries for herself. Greenberg's memoir radiates with the hope and the strength of a woman determined to learn and live her own truth.  <br /> <br />This is a well-written book filled with emotion that will haunt you long after you've finished the book. It will make you examine your life and how you're living it. I couldn't put this book down. From the very first sentences, \\"I'm scared. Always and about everything,\\" I read on wanting to know more about this woman and her journey. <br />	2005-06-11

If I have to explain, this book is NOT for you. Most women know intuitively what they think makes a \\"chick flick,\\" but after reading this Guide, they will understand what elements make up the best chick flicks; the ones we gush to girlfriends, \\"You have just got to see!\\" <br /> <br />American's movie sweetheart (someone women will love as much as men do) today is Julia Roberts, with Meg Ryan and Sandra Bullock close behind. Can we think of Meg Ryan without remembering the scene in \\"When Sally Met Harry.\\" We ALL wanted what she was having. <br /> <br />Did you join millions of women who bought a polka-dot dress after seeing a bad girl become a fashion plate in \\"Pretty Woman\\"? You get the idea. We buy into these heroines, what they wear and how they treat men (and are treated by men). <br /> <br />I loved these subtitles under How to Create the Perfects Romance. <br />1. Create a sympathetic heroine. <br />2. Offer up a love-worthy hero (we know, the Tom Hanks type). <br />3. Don't forget the best friend. <br />4. Something is wrong with the heroine type. <br />5. They meet. <br />6. Toss in impediment to the romance. <br />7. They dance. <br />8. Memorable moment (like Angela Bassett torching her wandering husband's car in \\"Waiting to Exhale.\\" You go girl!). <br />9. The hero employs the three magic words. <br />10. Achieve the ultimate happy (or unhappy ending). <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book as fodder for girlfriend conversation over a fudge brownie sundae. It made me check out my video (yes, video) supply. There I found almost every one of the often-watched movies mentioned in the book. Am I into chick flicks, or what? <br />	2005-06-11

Doug Hall is the co-founder of Eureka! Ranch, a think tank that has produced more successful marketing campaigns than almost any other in recent memory. This book builds on the experiences that Doug has had with helping clients develop both products and marketing campaigns that truly enrich the reader. Meaningful Marketing draws comparisons and contrasts between Meaningful Marketing and Mindless Marketing. Hall and his co-author Jeffrey Stamp not only grab us with data, they grab us emotionally. For example, based on the results of 901 new products at the end of five years, those with a Meaningful Marketing approach had a 53% survival rate (still available and profitable). Those with a Mindless Marketing approach had a 24% survival rate - almost a 100% difference. And the point is, we can all choose between approaches.  <br /> <br />This book says that you can take the moral high road, tell the truth about your products and services, charge a premium because they solve problems, add value, and make a difference - and sleep like a baby at night! I like that.  <br /> <br />In this unique two-page format, a data-proven point is made on the left-hand page, and then on the right-hand page are 3 to 5 practical applications of how to make it work. This book belongs on the shelf of anyone with any responsibility at all for either sales or marketing.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

Abby Houston is a divorced, obituary writer from Dexter, Georgia who has turned into a bestselling author. She is the consummate Southern woman: charming, polite, quirky, sassy and tough like silk. In other words, she's what we Northern women admire, even though we'll deny it all the way into tomorrow.  <br /> <br />Abby Houston's mother is actively looking for a husband for her daughter. But Abby's heart has been broken too many times so she's not looking for Mr. Right. She's not even looking for Mr. Good Enough.  <br /> <br />Then one day Abby waltzes into the small town of Bliss, Mississippi to do a book signing, and her life is changed forever. Abby falls head over heels in love with the town and the people who reside there (except for one hard-nosed, opinionated spinster) - and they fall in love with her. And they love her so much it's going to be difficult for Abby to 'leave without a little love in her heart-and a lot of Bliss in her soul.'  <br /> <br />At times The Town That Came A-Courtin' by Ronda Rich seems a bit slow and too wordy. In general, however, it is a playful, witty and captivating romp filled with love, relationships and charm enough to keep you smiling long after you've finished the book.  <br />	2005-06-11

Jake just doesn't take to people. His dog Shoestring is enough company for him.  <br /> <br />On his monthly trip to town for supplies, Jake and Shoestring find a battered old trunk resting in the middle of the road, and Jake leaves the unknown owner a lost and found note at the store. Months later, when no one has claimed the trunk, Old Jake finds many uses for its contents of calico skirts.  <br /> <br />Jake uses the skirts to mop up rainwater that leaked through the roof of his home during a rain storm, dresses up his scarecrow, patches clothes and makes neckerchiefs for himself and Shoestring. His farm is now bright and prettied up. At least he and the church ladies think so.  <br /> <br />One day a young girl and her father arrive at the farm looking for the trunk as it had contained the skirts of the man's wife who recently died. Old Jake expresses his sorrow and explains what has happened to the skirts. He gives the young girl the last one, now hanging outside on the clothesline. Jake also gives the young girl a beautifully hand-carved doll dressed in a calico skirt.  <br /> <br />I love this story! It is about an unexpected gift that keeps on giving. The skirts transform Old Jake's attitude and behavior, and in turn, his transformation is felt by other people.  <br /> <br />I would suggest that this is a book best read to children over age 7 as it is quite lengthy and pretty heavy on text.  <br /> <br />The illustrations are stunning and could be framed!  <br />	2005-06-11

Have you ever snuggled next to your Grandmother on the sofa as she gently patted your hand and talked about her adventures as a young girl? Or sat across the kitchen table from your favorite aunt, and while you sipped your steaming cup of tea, her eyes twinkled as she described her first love? <br /> <br />That is how I felt reading The Fortunate Four and Other Journeys of the Heart. Joy Kuby has interviewed women who have experienced most of what the 20th century had to offer. She has taken their stories, and sometimes their journal entries and precious love letters, and has shared them with her readers. Through the repetition of these ordinary stories you are reminded that no life is ordinary; that every life is filled with miracles and courage and is touched with love. <br /> <br />It is clear that Kuby cares deeply for each woman, and she marvels as they move through the Great Depression and World War II, building lives rich in experience and adventure. At the end of your life, Kuby is told, it is your memories that remain. And that is the challenge for each of us, to create memories of our own to cherish.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

I believe that even I can take junk and make something useful and attractive out of it.  <br /> <br />The book has enticing samples of repurposed junk that is set off with great pictures. Also included are junking tips and directions for taking that piece of junk and transforming it into a thing of purpose and beauty.  <br /> <br />I love this book!

There, my admission is out there, and I'm feeling a certain sense of relief. I just don't have the time, patience or energy to cook, especially since I spent years cooking for a very large family. And we all know that many children aren't particularly impressed with any type of cuisine that doesn't include peanut butter, hot dogs or macaroni and cheese. So it was with some hesitation that I decided to review a cookbook.  <br /> <br />Judy Walker, the former food writer for The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette, has written a cookbook that even I can enjoy. The recipes are simple, use ingredients that are in most grocery stores, they don't sacrifice flavor for convenience and they can be prepared in twenty minutes or less. And we can use the microwave oven, slow cooker or food processor to cook them.  <br /> <br />The chapters include appetizers, soups and salads, side dishes, main dishes, breads and brunch dishes and desserts. I particularly liked that Walker includes tips to simplify cooking meals and an exhaustive list of ingredients for a well-stocked kitchen.  <br /> <br />My favorite recipes from Walker's book are: Ajo Mushrooms, Country America's Southwest Salad, Killer Cornbread and Sausage Dressing, Skewered Chicken (it's yummy and quick), Easiest Chicken Enchilada Casserole Ever, Colorful Cornbread, and the scrumptious Pumpkin Pie Cake!  <br /> <br />I know my husband is secretly hoping other cookbooks cross my desk in the future. I know because his mouth begins to water when he sees the UPS driver arrive with packages of books.  <br /> <br />Note: The colorful illustrations by Monte Varah are beautiful and add much to this attractive cookbook.  <br />	2005-06-11

Walks in Beauty by Hazel Krantz is the story of Anita Whiterock, a Navajo teenager who walks between two nations - that of the Native American and of mainstream America.  <br /> <br />Four years after her father left for Albuquerque, Anita continues to mourn the loss. She is angry with him and doesn't believe he loves her. Her anger spills over into her relationship with her mother, causing a strain. Anita is also experiencing, at age fifteen, the first blush of romance with all the typical problems and obstacles.  <br /> <br />Walks in Beautyis a well-written novel that gives readers a brief look at the Navajo life. Its pace is slow and the story is sweet in its own way. And that sweetness makes it so refreshing in an era where gritty and edgy stories reign-even if readers even if we'd rather read a sweet story.  <br />	2005-06-11

Brenda Elsagher is living proof that if you're determined (a feisty attitude is a bonus) and armed with a brutal sense of humor, the spirit of a fighter won't be defeated. And Brenda is a fighter. Diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 1995, she shares in If The Battle Is Over Why Am I Still In Uniform? her private war with a deadly enemy; one she was determined to beat.  <br /> <br />After reading this book I will never think about my colon, or any other body part for that matter, in the same way again. I learned that screening for colorectal cancer is important, because if caught early enough, it can be cured. <br /> <br />If The Battle Is Over Why Am I Still In Uniform? is filled with wit, wisdom, and the stark realities of cancer. I laughed often and my eyes misted more than once. It is a well-written book of one woman's cancer reality. It is also the story of that woman's determination to grow old with her husband and meet her grandchildren.  <br /> <br />This book will provide you with information that might just save your life. If you know someone with colorectal cancer, sharing this book with them will let them know that they're not fighting the battle alone. <br /> <br />Also, if you know someone (maybe you) who is long overdue for their colon screening, this book will encourage them with reality.

In our overwhelmed and overscheduled life, we don't often leave time for prayer - and when we do, we want an answer and we want it now. With our desire for instant gratification we often don't see the big picture that God has for us for today, or for the future. Psalm 69:13: I will pray to you, Lord; answer me, God, at a time you choose, says it all.  <br /> <br />God is knocking at the door, ready, willing and able to answer our prayers. We need to 1) Pray, open the door and let him in, 2) Expect the unexpected, 3) Realize He has chosen us, selected us for His team, and 4) Trust God and not depend on just our own understanding.  <br /> <br />Mother Teresa is quoted as saying, \\"God does not call the equipped, He equips the called.\\"  <br /> <br />The chapter-ending points to ponder will really hit home and give you lots to think about. They might also allow you to let go of some control. The Scripture for Reflection is a wonderful easy-to-use section to guide those new to prayer or refocus others.  <br /> <br />Sherwood writes, \\"Open your mind, open your heart and God will open your eyes.\\"  <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

Starting with the introduction, she asserts, \\"To write poetry in America is in itself a subversive act.\\" Then reading through the essays on the personal, the poetic, the political - to the works of Emerson and the concept of common ground - she engages in an articulate and meaningful way the importance of poetry, pushing boundaries, and allowing no one to own the language.  <br /> <br />No topic escaped her notice in the bi-monthly column she wrote for American Poetry Review during 1996-1999. Her essay on the black dress amuses but informs beyond what one expects. Other essays are almost technical but very readable in their discussion of the use of language, fragment, form, reality and poetry.  <br /> <br />The insights she attains from people such as Sylvia Plath, Howard Hughes, Bob Dylan and later Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky and Emerson, world events such as Abu Grab and 9/11 and her own chaotic life experience, are interwoven with her views on poetry and aesthetics. The Night Sky is a fascinating read and makes one want to be a poet.  <br />	2005-06-11

Although it is set in New Hampshire, Willard's writing has the feel of a Southern novel. And for me that is a positive. I enjoy the sense of place and being that many of the good Southern writers possess - and Raising Hope fills the bill.  <br /> <br />Two distinctly different women from the same small New Hampshire town are brought together in an unusual manner. Ruth Teller was raised by a single mother who worked hard cleaning the houses of her town's wealthier inhabitants. Sara Lynn Hoffman came from one of the wealthy families that Ruth's mother worked for. Ruth barely graduated from high school and began working for her mother. Sara Lynn was the valedictorian of their class and became a lawyer.  <br /> <br />Because of the vast differences in their lives and circumstances, these woman should never have come into contact with each other following graduation. But life sometimes laughs at us and our preconceived notions. Not only did they meet again but they are sharing a home and raising a twelve-year-old girl named Hope. This child, who came into their lives shortly after her birth and as a result of a tragedy, has changed their lives and their outlook on life.  <br /> <br />The novel moves back and forth in time and is told from the perspective of Ruth, Sara Lynn, Hope and Sara Lynn's elderly mother, Mamie.  <br /> <br />Raising Hope is a delightful novel about mothers and daughters - and also about unconditional love. It proves that family can be anywhere and can be anyone.  <br />	2005-06-11

It's still here but updated for 21st century moms. Feed Me I'm Yours was in my kitchen for years as I raised my six children. We all know how difficult it can be to satisfy those little ones of various ages and tastes. Well, this book gave me a creative outlet while feeding my children (I was too busy with that many children to have time for any other creativity) and made the food interesting and attractive enough that even the pickiest child ate eagerly. <br /> <br />Now, as the grandmother of ten (with more arriving soon) grandchildren I am able to once again solve meal-time blues with simple, yet interesting and attractively prepared meals for all those little ones I love to care for. What I particularly liked then and now about Lansky's Feed Me I'm Yours is that it's fun and easy! <br /> <br />As a bonus, the 30th Anniversary Edition provides all the latest must-know information on infant feeding, food that may cause allergic reactions, poison prevention, birthday ideas and games and so much more. I particularly liked having a section on weights and measures and food substitutions. Sometimes when you're missing an ingredient, it might mean taking several little ones out to eat, which can be a lot of work. This book provides substitutions that most everyone has around the house, unless you have empty cupboards and refrigerator. <br /> <br />Give yourself a treat with Feed Me I'm Yours. The kids will think you're a creative genius. I don't know about you, but as a grandmother I want all the points I can get. <br />	2005-06-11

Since she has never, ever given me a 'bad' recommendation, I settled in my sunroom on a rainy Saturday and read. I couldn't put it down. My husband made dinner, did the dishes and was kind enough to refrain from speaking (other than to say, \\"don't tell me, I want to read it myself).  <br /> <br />Paul and Joanna Breidbart want a child. In fact, they've tried unsuccessfully for five years to conceive. They decide to adopt from Columbia since they will have the least wait there.  <br /> <br />After an extremely short waiting period, the Breidbarts receive a referral for an infant girl and wing their way to South America to pick her up. The couple, particularly Paul has some concerns about the drug wars and political unrest in Columbia, but they trust their attorney who has worked with many other adoptive families.  <br /> <br />One afternoon, after they received their daughter and while they are still in Columbia, the Breidbarts leave the hotel for a short while. Their daughter Joelle stays behind with the nanny. When the couple returns, Joanna notices something different about Joelle - and the Breidbarts' life changes forever.  <br /> <br />This is the story of the lengths parents will go to for their children. It is proof positive that biology has nothing to do with love and commitment. The level of excitement in Detour is extraordinary and I repeatedly had to remind myself to breathe. The twists and turns are surprising and unexpected. I repeat now what the recommending bookseller said to me, \\"Read it, you won't be disappointed.\\" I can't wait to read Siegel's first novel Derailed.   <br />	2005-06-11

And Bubbles Betrothed is a madcap, fast-paced and riotous caper through her unusual life and times. This is an enjoyable beach read.

Lou Jane Temple's latest novel The Spice Box is a historical mystery set in 1860's New York City.  <br /> <br />Bridget Haney is an Irish immigrant who grew up on New York's mean streets and in an orphanage with her sister Maggie. Bridget has always loved to cook and has aspired to cook for a wealthy New York family.  <br /> <br />Bridget realizes her dream when she is hired as the Gold family cook. Her first day on the job is marred when she finds the twice-shot body of Seth, the Gold's son, in the dough box. Bridget and Isaac Gold, Seth's father join forces to find the killer and Bridget's missing sister, Maggie.  <br /> <br />The Spice Box is an interesting look at 1860's New York life and the differences between the serving class and their employers. Temple has also included some delicious mouth-watering recipes.  <br /> <br />While the novel and its characters are somewhat predictable and formulaic, The Spice Box is a satisfying and enjoyable read and worth the time. I'll read her next novel too. <br />	2005-06-08

The lead actress, Catarina Velosi is a no-show for the performance and Alfonso Reventon, who wrote the play for Catarina, is concerned about her. When Reventon requests that his friend, Silvio Aguilar go to Catarina's apartment to check on her, Eve Diamond tags along.  <br /> <br />After arriving at Catarina's apartment and taking in the disturbing scene, Eve believes that the actress's disappearance involves foul play. When Catarina's body is later found, the case becomes personal for Eve. The police believe Silvio, her boyfriend, is good for the murder because of his past relationship with the victim. But Eve learns that there are a multitude of characters that hated the actress enough to snuff out her life. It is then that Eve summons her skills as a journalist to ferret out exactly what happened.  <br /> <br />Eve's quest to solve the murder is complicated by a young reporter, Felice Morgan, who may be falsifying stories and whom insinuates herself in Eve's case. Eve doesn't particularly like Felice and definitely doesn't want a partner.  <br /> <br />Savage Garden is Denise Hamilton's fourth Eve Diamond adventure. It is a hard-boiled mystery that is well-written and possesses a compelling, suspenseful and edgy plot. The characters are well-drawn and the fast-paced writing makes it difficult to put down.  I'm looking forward to the next Eve Diamond adventure.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-08

Michael Craig takes us behind the scenes of a series of cash Texas Hold 'Em games that make the tournaments you see on TV pale by comparison. Imagine betting $100,000 and $200,000 per hand - and it's your money!  <br /> <br />The professor, Howard Lederer, gave up a computer science major in 1985 when as a freshman he won $100,000 playing poker. The banker is Andy Beal, a self-made billionaire who earned $50 million plus per year from his various enterprises, including Beal Bank of Dallas. And the suicide king is the king of hearts. Poker players know that the king of hearts holds his own sword at his head, thus the name \\"suicide king.\\"  <br /> <br />A dozen times over four years (from 2001 to 2004), Beal would go to Las Vegas to play heads-up poker at table one at the Bellagio. He'd play against a syndicate of the world's best poker players, including Doyle Brunson, Jennifer Harmon, Chip Reese, and Howard Lederer. (Heads-up poker means that rather than up to nine players at a table, there would be only two - playing each other \\"heads-up\\"). Millions would change hands in each game - until over $20 million was on the table during the final game in May of 2004.  <br /> <br />The stakes were so high that \\"flags\\" (red, white and blue edged chips worth $5,000) were not used. In Las Vegas $5,000 chips are rarely seen, yet the Bellagio has rarer-still $25,000 chips. And even the Bellagio wasn't prepared for a high stakes game of this magnitude. The Bellagio ran out of $25,000 chips to be used in the game!  <br /> <br />As Craig describes the action you get a behind the scenes look at the preparation both sides made - and a history of Texas Hold 'Em that few have ever seen. You learn how the top professional poker players, made famous by the televised tournaments, came to the game and gained their poker education, you learn about the legends who kept the game alive until television discovered it. The action is fast, the descriptions vivid, the analysis revealing. This book is a real life pageturner!  <br /> <br />	2005-06-08

As a six-year member of Business Networking Int'l (BNI), I was leery about reading one more book about networking. I was wrong!  <br /> <br />Author and speaker Dean Lindsay has a humorous way to remind us that networking is about trust, value, liking yourself... and that networking is an art, actually a skill, a creative process.  <br /> <br />I believe with many things that we know, sometimes we need to be reminded about things like: Every time we network, we should play the role of a \\"progress agent,\\" working to find mutual benefit.  <br /> <br />If we need to network to grow our business or find good resources, Lindsay gives us the important \\"rehash\\" of the type of common mistakes and pitfalls - as well as the benefits of being a successful networker. Boy, did they hit home.  <br /> <br />His 4-Step \\"Cracking the Network CODE\\" is: C: Create personal curb appeal (not new shrubbery but a \\"friendly\\" facelift) <br />O: Open face-to-face relationships (with those who want one) <br />D: Deliver solid first impressions (duh, mother always told us that) <br />E: Earn trust (easy to say, but hard sometimes to accomplish in today's e-mail, fast-paced business life.  <br /> <br />Personally, as an extrovert I am energized by meeting new people and networking with them (even recalling my parents' warning about strangers). That is not true for everyone. Lindsay said, \\"Just because someone could, does not mean they will refer you to others.\\" So networking is mostly about personal contact, ongoing relationships and as stated earlier, being a \\"progress agent.\\"  <br /> <br />And the book contains wonderful quotes and business reminders that we may or may not already know. Sometimes I get upset when a person I met networking doesn't want to interact, but then as the book says, I need to go on to the next person I meet, keep lines of communication open and work to build the kind of relationship that is mutually beneficial. It is not about collecting a bunch of strangers' business cards ... but turning strangers into friends. [...] says this is worth reading to be refocused and energized.  <br />	2005-06-08

Faded Pictures From My Backyard is the story of the Carswell family, told by oldest daughter Sue, using an age-appropriate child's voice through the years.  <br /> <br />The father is an administrator at the Albany Home for Children. The family lived just this side of the home/orphanage-and they never, ever were allowed to interact with the children. The Carswell children never understood the \\"why\\" of this rule, and it was described as another \\"it's complicated\\" answer to some questions.  <br /> <br />The orphans ranged from 6 to 18 (when they left to make their way in the world). The only parents these children knew were the houseparents paid to care for them. How they must have secretly envied the five Carswell children with both a mother and a father, especially at holidays ... and bedtime.  <br /> <br />Saturdays the Home's children were dressed in their best hand-me-down clothing to line up and wait for visitors who might be a parent or it might be a new mom and dad come to adopt them. Children were on display every Saturday, and seldom is one selected or even visited.  <br /> <br />Some were truly orphans, others relinquished to the home for \\"adult\\" reasons, and others became residents because they had mental illness, or considered incorrigible.  <br /> <br />The author herself has frequent childhood bouts with anxiety, baseless fears and worry, way beyond a normal child's. We later learn that although her father worked with troubled children - or better said, children with troubles, and the mother was a nurse there, both choose to minimize their daughter's maladies, and not get her treatment.  <br /> <br />Her book follows these children and her family as they struggle, learn and grow up. At a 1989 reunion the former Home residents told wonderful stories of hope and love. Some were very successful, others succumb early to depression and misdirection. Some Home children had difficulty when adults because they never learned traditional relationships and what \\"mother love\\" is.  <br /> <br />The author however has received tremendous \\"mother love\\" all her life - and had as one of her fears that her mother Elaine would die when she was young (as her mother had).  <br /> <br />The famous quotes used are annotated that each writer also lost one or both parents while young.  <br /> <br />The book is a great story as you cheer for them, worry for them, and then grieve with them all. In the 1960s such residential homes still existed. Kind counselors, houseparents and support staff cared for and about these children, and you will too. [...] says Faded Pictures From My Backyard is a very worthwhile read if you want your humanity button pushed a couple dozen times.  <br />	2005-06-08

Statistics show that one in four women have been abused. It is safe to say that if we have not been abused, we know one or several women who have been. Jan Coates, author of Set Free: God's Healing Power for Abuse Survivors and Those Who Love Them, weaves throughout the book the stories of several abuse survivors who have risen from the depths of abuse and have been transformed and restored through God's healing power of love.  <br /> <br />Coates' book serves to remind survivors that what happened to them is not their fault; and that they are valuable and worthy to call on God; to leave their past behind; and to be given a peaceful heart. It also is helpful for survivors to read about others and to know that they too can really rise up and be healed.  <br /> <br />Set Free is helpful for counselors, pastors, friends and also family members. Often people don't understand a survivor's attitudes or destructive behaviors. The stories explain how abuse affects people.  <br /> <br />In the back of the book, Coates has provided an 1) extensive resource list, 2) a simple guide to reaching a place of peace with God, and 3) staggering facts about child abuse in the United States.  <br /> <br />If this book serves no other purpose than to help a survivor begin the journey to restoration, or help someone close to them understand an abuse survivor, or recognize a victim so they can help, it is a resounding success.  <br />	2005-06-08

Minnesota mystery writer Ellen Hart knows how to spin a wonderful, face-paced, complex mystery with characters you love to love and characters you... Well, you just want to slap some of them - and hate the rest.  <br /> <br />Businessman Ken Loy loves bike riding. And if you have to die, as Loy does, then it's great to die doing something you love. Being shot between the eyes, however, is not so great. A half an hour later, Bob Fabian, the wealthy owner of the \\"Minneapolis Times Register\\" is also shot. Interestingly the two murdered men have a connection. A year earlier Loy broadsided Fabian's wife's car, killing her instantly. A lot of people see only a coincidence. Sophie Greenway, food critic, doesn't believe it for a minute, and she begins asking questions that might bring danger knocking on her own door.  <br /> <br />Coupled with the murders, there is the relationship between Sophie and her high school sweetheart, Nathan Buckridge - and between Sophie and her husband Bram's daughter, Margie - and between Sophie and her husband Bram. It all makes for an intense and exciting read. But I do so wish a certain young woman would get her comeuppance. Perhaps in the next Sophie Greenway mystery that will happen.

Shannon Kubiak, author of God Called a Girl tells us that her book is not about Mary as much as it is about God and what God did with one willing teenager committed to Him. And it is about what He can do with all teenagers that are committed to Him and to being world changers.  <br /> <br />Kubiak sees life as a God adventure. God knows our gifts and passions and purpose and challenges us to use them for His glory. She recognizes that our struggles with God and His purpose for us are all too often about us wanting to control. We so often believe that we know best, or that trusting God is too frightening.  <br /> <br />Kubiak clarifies her statements with personal stories that are wonderful metaphors. She also provides a message that will help women be another girl that God calls.  <br /> <br />This is a wonderful, thoughtful book for young women to read, ponder and then plan what they are going to do as world changers. But it is also a wonderful read for all of us because God is calling us all. So if you're an adult giving this book to an important young woman in your life, I would suggest that you read it too. It will spur you on to challenging yourself to think about and plan your commitment to impacting your sphere of influence.  <br />	2005-05-31

Mary Doria Russell is a phenomenon - and with her newest book, A Thread of Grace, it becomes impossible to label Russell as a 'certain type' of writer. She seems to write what interests her, and as a result her passion shows.  <br /> <br />Russell's historical novel, A Thread of Grace is set during WWII. Jewish refugees are being escorted to safety by Italian soldiers. But the sense of security in settling into a small Italian town, protected by its inhabitants, is short-lived when it is learned that Mussolini has surrendered to the Germans.  <br /> <br />A Thread of Grace follows the lives of several characters: an Italian resistance leader, a priest, an Italian rabbi's family and a German doctor. Through these characters we discover the truth of the Italian underground, a movement that saved over 40,000 Jewish people during the war.  <br /> <br />Russell is a marvelous writer and storyteller. The intensity with which she writes is staggering. Her plot is complex and well researched, her prose is fluid and compelling and her characters are so wonderfully human. She is one of my favorite authors and A Thread of Grace is even better than The Sparrow and Children of God.  <br />	2005-05-31

He bonds with his son while on a motorcycle ride with other cops. Later one of them, a sheriff's deputy, Emo Rojas, gets killed serving a routine warrant.  <br /> <br />Or was it a routine warrant? He's blown away by Vincent Smiley, a wannabe cop with an arsenal that would stand off an army. Did ATF, who asked that the warrant be served, know more than they're telling? Why did Smiley then launch an all-out assault on the back-up that arrived? If Smiley wanted to commit suicide, why did he wear so much body armor?  <br /> <br />While these questions are still unanswered the plot thickens. A member of the ATF sniper team and a sheriff's department counterpart are both killed, apparently with weapons from the other department. Tempers flare, accusations fly, and everyone demands justice and vengeance, not necessarily in that order.  <br /> <br />As the only neutral law enforcement group left, the LAPD is asked to investigate, and it falls to Shane Scully to do the deed. But nobody likes how he goes about his job. Everyone thinks Scully should be looking someplace else, and looking a whole lot faster. The politicians are all trying to figure the angles and all the police departments want this to go away before it becomes more newsworthy than it already is.  <br /> <br />What follows is a roller coaster ride that gives the reader a look at police procedures and politics that feels all too real. Everybody - except Scully, wants a quick solution, but not necessarily the truth. What looks true turns out to be false. And what seems not worth spending time on, ends up being key to unraveling the real mystery before the body count rises.  <br /> <br />The characters are believable and Cannell does a wonderful job of helping us feel what they are feeling. We want the case to be solved. We want lives to be healed. We want good to triumph over evil. We want a simpler time - though, likeScully, we realize that that will never happen.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-29

God is the one who decides all things with respect to a country.  <br />God determines national leaders and decides national blessings. And God listens to the prayers of his people - if and when they pray.  <br />Even Jesus, rather than acting, turned to prayer and asked God, his heavenly father, to act. In Matthew 14:23 it says, \\"Jesus went up on a mountainside alone to pray.\\" Jesus did not call us to teach, preach, have committee meetings or do anything without ceasing - except to pray without ceasing. Jesus did not call his house a house of fellowship, music, study, political activities, exposition or anything else - except a house of prayer (Matthew 21:13).  <br /> <br />The author encourages us to take our nation, family, and friends and present them before God in prayer.  <br /> <br />Even Peter, one of Jesus' inner circle, could not stand by the Savior but denied Him three times in His hour of need and turned and ran. But He also turned, returned, and confessed and repented - and he was forgiven and restored.  <br /> <br />What God wants us to do, Lucado asserts, is to stop pointing the finger at others, point the finger at ourselves, get real before God so that God can heal our land. Yet, as Lucado says, we typically pray as casually as we'd order a burger at a drive through.  <br /> <br />If you get the idea that I think that everyone needs to read Turn: Remembering Our Foundations, - you're right.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-29

Many of us have lost interest or found it more difficult than we thought it would be. The result was failure. We didn't reach our weight loss and health goal.  <br /> <br />Laurette Willis, personal trainer, public speaker and author of Basic Steps to Godly Fitness, provides solid information about why our diets can and often do more harm than good. Willis offers her vast experience with health and fitness to provide us with a biblical approach to fitness: a Christian alternative to yoga. She believes her program will encourage our spirit, refresh our souls and nourish our bodies.  <br /> <br />Willis provides practical suggestions to turn dull exercises that we really don't want to do into acts of worship. She gives simple and useful steps to better incorporate nutrition and fitness into our daily lives. These steps will bring lasting results. Willis discusses ways to overcome destructive thought patterns, make healthy choices and discover how forgiveness will free us. And she shows us ways to grow in our relationship with God.  <br /> <br />I found Basic Steps to Godly Fitness to be interesting, logical and easily understood. I personally found the information on stress to be a reminder that is worth reading and then re-reading. The photographs accompanying the exercise descriptions were sound and easily followed. And there are suggested menus and a few recipes that contain ingredients that most people have in their kitchens.  <br /> <br />This is a prayerful diet and exercise program worth taking a look at.  <br />	2005-05-24

The Bright Forever by Lee Martin will grab hold of you, compelling you to finish it as fast as you can and then it will haunt you long afterwards. Martin has written prose that is complex, fast-paced and filled with emotion that will take your breath away. It is written in alternating voices and while that can be confusing for readers, Martin manages to make seamless transitions.  <br /> <br />A small town in Indiana is the backdrop for an act that is becoming all to frequent in our society: the kidnapping of a child. It is a beautiful summer evening when Katie Mackey, daughter of the most affluent and influential family in town, sets out on her bicycle to return three library books. She never returns home.  <br /> <br />The story of the events surrounding the kidnapping of Katie Mackey is told in the desperate and at times anguished voices of those intimately involved with the event.  <br /> <br />Martin spins his tale in such a way that we enter the story and move through each character's thoughts, words and deeds. We ache for the family, are shocked at the thoughts and actions of human beings toward each other, and wonder what we are capable of doing in certain circumstances.  <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-05-24

The time is the late 1950s where we find an uncomplicated sort of innocence, to the 1960s that are filled with turbulence and unrest. <br /> <br />The Orange Blossom Special is the first passenger train to connect New York to Miami. Tess, a widow of two years, and her daughter Dinah, who has lost her lust for life, decide to leave Carbondale to create a new life for themselves in Gainesville, Florida; the destination of the Orange Blossom Special. <br /> <br />People often say that you can't choose your family but you can choose your friends. In The Orange Blossom Special, Tess and Dinah create family by choosing them from various people they meet along the way. And through various trials and tribulations they ultimately realize that they have found their place - and it's called home. <br /> <br />Betsy Carter has a distinct voice and writes with humor and compassion. She is only going to improve with each book. I love the way she views the world, and I enjoy the multi-layered, rich characters in her book. <br />	2005-05-24

Throughout the book that focuses on World War II, we learn about heroism, camaraderie, segregation, exclusion, demoralization, prejudice -- and patriotism.  <br /> <br />Often black men were sent on the most difficult missions - ands then their efforts were greatly downplayed or excluded from history (both when it happened) and in written-down history.  <br /> <br />Black women also served as nurses and with other support units. The 6,888th Central Postal Direction Battalion, an all-black unit, assigned some 80 black women to handle mail sorting at a base in Birmingham, England. Those women were the first black people many English had seen, and they helped to shatter stereotypes.  <br /> <br />Many of us have heard of the Tuskegee Airmen and all they accomplished. Other black soldiers, trained as paratroopers, were sent to the West Coast of the United States and became firefighters. Their job was to jump into remote forested area and put out fires caused by airborne incendiary bombs sent aloft by the Japanese.  <br /> <br />Also, a third of the 10,500 soldiers who built the Alcan Highway (from Canada through roughest Alaska) were black. This major construction project was rushed to ensure that America had a way to get supplies to northward to defend our borders if the enemy blocked our supply ships.  <br /> <br />The book was filled with such interesting facts that any history buff will love it.

The epic novel Islands, by Dan Sleigh is an ambitious first novel covering the first fifty years of the Dutch settlement at the Cape of Good Hope in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. It is a fascinating novel thoroughly researched by Sleigh and constructed from factual accounts, official records and personal letters.  <br /> <br />Islands is the life stories of seven men who are all connected in one way or another to the beautiful Pieternella, the daughter of a Dutch surgeon Peter Havgard and Eva, a Hottentot woman. Pieternella is the offspring of the first mixed marriage in the new colony.  <br /> <br />Islands is a haunting drama filled with excitement, greed, power, intrigue, war and individual courage. At times the novel is absolutely spectacular and at other times the story seems to drag a bit. The book is well over 700 pages so it takes commitment to begin the story. But overall it is a mesmerizing saga; one that will keep you turning the pages and have you considering the story and history long after you've finished it. This is a novel that will be appreciated by those who particularly enjoy historical writings.  <br />	2005-05-24

When we give up the tendency to compare ourselves to others - when we just do and don't judge - then we can create art.  <br /> <br />Author Langer states in On Becoming An Artist, that most of us find it safer to put off doing creative things out of fear of making fools of ourselves. She asks: \\"What exactly are the obstacles that keep us from doing what we are drawn to do?\\"  <br /> <br />Not everyone should strive for perfection but be part of the \\"school of the untaught.\\" We can do art, be an artist for our own enjoyment -- without comparing ourselves with anyone else. Van Gogh was not famous in his lifetime. People do not like all the same kinds of art/creativity.  <br /> <br />Langer's premise is based on mindful thinking. Mindfulness is simply the process of noticing new things.  <br /> <br />Her writing made me think about how many times we are \\"our own worst enemy.\\" We will start our creativity (paint, music, draw, write, whatever) tomorrow ... when we have time ... when we're empty nesters, etc. We do everything but create.  <br /> <br />\\"Someday\\" could be tomorrow if you read and take to heart Langer's message. In our creativity we need to distinguish the end product from the art/experience of creating it.  <br /> <br />Too many of us believe that a \\"rich creative life\\" belongs to a few select people. Wrong, creativity is in everything we do.  <br /> <br />Refrain from judging and just do. Start your personal renaissance. Becoming An Artist may just be the jumpstart you need.  <br />	2005-05-24

I enjoy Southern novels and writers almost as much as I enjoy chocolate. It is nirvana for me to be introduced to a new Southern novelist. Stealing with Style is Emyl Jenkins' debut novel. And a stunning debut it is. The storyline is interesting, the characters are inviting and the information about antiques is absolutely intriguing. I will be extremely disappointed if there isn't another Sterling Glass novel. I particularly enjoyed the bright, knowledgeable and interesting middle-aged heroine, Sterling Glass. <br /> <br />Sterling Glass is a divorced antiques appraiser from a small town in Virginia. Her life has a certain simple rhythm that is satisfying. But when several rare and valuable items begin appearing at the local Salvation Army store, she uncovers an intricate plot involving old Virginia families, their valued treasures, and some people of dubious character in and out of the antique world. And if that isn't enough, she finds herself helping an elderly New York man preserve his family heritage. But to help him she must enter the world of greed and danger. <br /> <br />Sterling Glass is savvy when it comes to antiques. But that skill doesn't always transfer to people, especially dishonest people with hidden agendas. It's that part of her character that makes her all the more interesting and special. There is also the small promise of a future romance. But I'm not sure at this point if the obvious romance choice is so obvious. <br /> <br />If you want an extremely satisfying read, this is the book.  You will enjoy it.  Mark my words, Emyl Jenkins is going to be a star!	2005-05-20

This time Neil Rucker acts as narrator, although many of the same characters from Flabbergasted make an appearance.  <br /> <br />Neil Rucker is a missionary working as a language instructor in Ecuador. Rucker is about to embark on an 8-week furlough. After he tells Jay (from Flabbergasted) that he has been dateless for 7 months, one week, two days and counting ... Jay tells him about the girls in Greenville, South Carolina - and convinces him to spend his furlough there.  <br /> <br />Rucker decides to follow Jay's suggestion and travels to South Carolina where he meets Darcy, Lydia and Alexis, mingles with the men's singles group, and goes on the annual beach vacation.  <br /> <br />Life is good until disaster strikes in Ecuador and Allie and Jay need help. The group immediately leaves South Carolina for Ecuador to help.  <br /> <br />A Delirious Summer has quirky characters and crazy situations. It's another lighthearted read with a lot of laughs and includes spiritual insights. I enjoyed A Delirious Summer, but not as much as I enjoyed Flabbergasted.  <br />	2005-05-17

I enjoy them so much that I forgive inaccuracies and suspend belief for the sake of the story. I also forgive just adequate writing because an author's characters and plot are well developed. But with Roxana Robinson's novel Sweetwater, none of that was necessary. All I had to do was settle in and devour what has become one of my all-time favorite novels.  <br /> <br />Isabel Green took a vacation from life following the death of her first husband. Then she met Paul Simmons, married him because it seemed right, and attempted to reconnect again with the world.  <br /> <br />Seven months after her marriage to Paul, he and Isabel travel to the Simmons' summer lodge in the Adirondacks. There Isabel struggles to connect with and understand her husband, his complicated parents and his brother, who appears to have a thorny relationship with Paul. Isabel's time at the lodge brings up the painful reality of her first marriage and awakens feelings that she doesn't understand - and that evoke guilt.  <br /> <br />Everything in Robinson's book is married to the environment, reflects the delicate balance between nature and the humans that inhabit the world, and speaks of the author's deep relationship with nature.  <br /> <br />Robinson's prose is fluid; her character's are complex, rich with flaws and deep emotions. The plot is compelling and unique. It is expertly constructed and the ending is both sad and satisfying at the same time. I can't wait to read Robinson's other works.  <br />	2005-05-17

In November 2004 the world watched as a politician in Ukraine, the second most powerful country in the former Soviet Union, wrested the presidency through popular and peaceful downtown protests in Kiev. After a second and unrigged election, Viktor Yuschenko became president in December, and, in April 2005, he and his Chicago-born wife were warmly received by the White House and Congress.  <br /> <br />Such a fairy tale was unimaginable during the Cold War years and during the 1990s following glasnost, the breakup of the Soviet Union and the crumbling of the Berlin Wall. In satellite nations like Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, and in several Soviet member nations, the new \\"democratic\\" leaders were seen to be the same who had once worn the livery of Moscow.  <br /> <br />Because of the great difficulty and uncertainty caused by real change, people yearn nostalgically for the numbing reliability of dictatorship. The Yuschenkoes' April visit forms an interesting counterpoint to Russell R. Miller's Journey to a Closed City. In his 30-year career with major U. S. multinationals, he traveled to over 100 countries. After retiring, in 1993 he accepted a two-month volunteer consultancy assignment to advise an evolving Ukranian manufacturing company that was trying to cope with capitalistic opportunity while embedded, more than figuratively - in Soviet concrete. His thoughts during those two months show the frustration and satisfaction of landing in an alien garden patch and trying to plant a few significant seeds.  <br /> <br />He weaves the threads of the disrupted Ukrainian business environment with his own uncertainty in his first significant retirement activity.  <br /> <br />Twelve years ago, when Miller visited the country, there was no chance that a Viktor Yuschenko could have risen to their presidency. Then the political and economic upheaval fed the citizen's gloom and despair and assured that an American visitor would be viewed with suspicion, no matter how sincere and competent.  <br /> <br />The story captures the mood of that not-too-distant past, so familiar to visitors to former Soviet countries.  <br /> <br />This autobiography is also an armchair traveler's window into a backward environment that still exists in corners of Russia and its former empire. Further, the story is very typical of the experiences of consultants from developed countries engaging with the Third World, whether on two-week or two-year assignments.  <br /> <br />Thankfully, Ukraine seems to have emerged from the economic and political gloom pictured so well by Miller. Unfortunately, other nations still have far to travel.  <br />	2005-05-17

I'm discovering it for the first time. It's simply lovely and is deserving of this new 50th Anniversary edition of 130 pages.  <br /> <br />It is obvious that the sea and the beach were an integral part of Ann Morrow Lindbergh's life as her writings are full of references to them. <br /> <br />Gift From The Sea is a woman's poetic reflection about the challenges we all face in our relationships with our family, friends, the world and ourselves. They are her thoughts and ideas but are universal when thinking about the human condition. <br /> <br />The introduction is written by Anne Morrow Lindbergh's son Reeve. Even 50 years after it was written, it continues to be fresh and filled with wisdom. It's a book to be read, savored and read again.  <br />	2005-05-17

All this might make the average person want to jump from a bridge.  <br /> <br />And that's exactly what Violet intends to do. She boards a San Francisco-bound bus in Kentucky, determined to jump from the Golden Gate Bridge and kill herself. But when the bus breaks down in North Dakota, she meets Kjel, who dreams of stardom, and his guitar-picking friend, Austin, who is black and challenges Violet's beliefs about segregation. The guys begin a journey to stardom, and Violet is going along for the ride.  <br /> <br />Oh My Stars is not like Landvik's other books - and that is a good thing. Now they all are wonderful books filled with humor, sadness, and reality, but somehow Oh My Stars cuts much deeper and stretches Lankvik's talent. And that stretch won't disappoint you. I will remember this book for a long time and will highly recommend it.  <br />	2005-05-11

Regi Campbell, author of About My Father's Business: Taking Your Faith to Work, challenges readers to be intentional in helping themselves move to the next level in their walk with Christ. To help readers reach their goal, Campbell has developed an intentionality map with five columns, A through E, with A for Apathetic and E for Excelling as a Christian.  <br /> <br />Campbell then suggests readers pray, asking the Lord to bring people to mind that He wants us to be in relationship with. As each name comes to mind, place it in one of the five columns without too much thought or evaluation about apathy or excelling.  <br /> <br />Then each day scan the names and ask the Lord who you should pray for and in what other ways you might be involved with them. It could be a phone call, a meal, sharing an article or a book, playing a round of golf, etc. <br /> <br />For Campbell it is about developing a relationship in advance of the gospel. Or rather it is living the gospel through the development of a relationship with others. Campbell's contention is that more people are turned off to Christianity by people who proclaim a message of love and restoration that they do not demonstrate in their own lives. Thus any challenging statement becomes a reason for ending the relationship. Campbell believes that relationships should be developed that can grow through challenges, including challenging conversations. <br /> <br />This is not an easy book to read, but for those who take Christ's command to go and make disciples of all nations, this book lays out a clear path for making a difference in people's lives.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-11

The thrust is to show what we can learn by looking into the word of God for insights through the biographical sketches of people. Wiersbe offers his insights into over 60 Bible characters - some well known like Paul and Abraham, other less well known such as Demas and Zedekiah. Yet each has a life story that we can learn from, be encouraged by, and sometimes warned by.  <br /> <br />Wiersbe also quotes liberally from some of the most inspiring Bible scholars and theologians such as Phillips Brooks, Charles Haddon Spurgeon and Alexander Whyte.  <br /> <br />In studying and speaking about biographical characters, we are exploring what Wiersbe feels is most precious: character. This approach to understanding the word helps us look at what is most important to God: a person's character. Is the person obedient, or disobedient? Does the person listen, or tune out? Does the person learn, or refuse to be taught?  <br /> <br />Whether teacher, preacher, or student, the reader will be blessed by what they find within these pages. Consider these words when writing about Job by Christopher Morley: \\"I had a million questions to ask God: but when I met Him, they all fled my mind, and it didn't seem to matter.\\" (See Job 23:3, 4; 31:35)  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-11

Ludlum's estate agreed to allow Eric Van Lustbader to write the fourth novel in the series - and it seamlessly works with the first three.  <br /> <br />Jason Bourne has settled into his new identity and new life as David Webb, a college professor with a loving wife who knows of his past, and two wonderful children.  <br /> <br />When Bourne is attacked in his classroom, he escapes and learns that two of the three people he can trust have been murdered - and he is the prime suspect. The CIA puts out a contract on Bourne and also on an assassin, Khan, who wants Bourne dead as well. Khan is Bourne's son who supposedly died - or did he? Khan appears to be a younger version of Bourne with the same skills and intelligence - and an intense hatred for the father who he believes abandoned him, his mother, and sister in Vietnam.  <br /> <br />The characters in Eric Van Lustbader's The Bourne Legacy are richly drawn, sophisticated humanitarians by day, terrorists by night; beautiful woman who are even more deadly than the men who are drawn to them. Friends who become foes, and foes that are really friends. Just when you think you've figured something out, a twist changes everything.

So thinking of the military families was not new for the Flemings. <br /> <br />Now Shauna's goal is 1.4 million letters, one for every person in the military service because May is National Military Appreciation Month. <br /> <br />Her book, A Million Thanks, contains 45 of Shauna's favorite letters and drawings as well as stories of how her life has changed since beginning her project. She recounts responses the letters have prompted from service men and women. Amazing young woman, amazing stories of what one committed and energetic person can do to make a difference in a million soldiers' lives.  <br />Visit: [...] <br />	2005-05-05

Joanne Gordon, author of Be Happy At Work, spent over a year searching for women who love what they do. Gordon has identified three themes and ten categories of happy working women. The 100 women come from all walks of life. Some are famous and some are everyday women. She tells their stories in a lively and straight-forward manner and discusses why they are happy and how we can achieve that same happiness in our own lives.  <br /> <br />I liked Gordon's bullet point definitions and descriptions. They were easy to find, read and refer to again. The stories are inspiring. If you're not happy at work, you might want to read this book - and then spend some good old-fashioned thinking time about what you can do to change your situation.  <br />	2005-05-05

Anne LaMott has been an author and creative writing teacher in California. And in her book Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, she tells us how she helps her students start writing, often using their own lives as fodder. Her simple advice is: Write, write, write. She suggests we try hard to recall our first memory, first day of school, first love, first of everything. So many of us have stories to tell, but we don't get started with pen to paper, hands to keyboard. She reminds us not to worry about the first draft, and to worry about libel later!  <br /> <br />I laughed as she described an editor by comparing them to a friend who will \\"put your pet down\\" when you pet has outlived its usefulness, and you can't do it yourself. This brand of humor is what you can expect from this and many of her books.  <br /> <br />Check her out. It took me forever to read Bird by Bird because I highlighted endlessly and took copious notes - and I thought of my first memories. You will, too.  <br /> <br />Other Lamott books: Blue Shoe; Crooked Little Heart, Rosie; All New People, Hard Laughter, Plan B: Future Thoughts on Faith plus she has short stories in many other books.  <br />	2005-05-05

Nick Barrett was born into a privileged Charleston, South Carolina family -- or was he? His father was a prominent Charleston war hero, or was he? His mother was a Charleston tramp, or was she?  <br /> <br />Nick was told his mother deserted him at age ten and ran off with his trust fund. The next nine years were spent living with relatives who could barely tolerate him for reasons he couldn't understand.  <br /> <br />Nick eloped with his childhood sweetheart. Four days later, he survived a car accident, losing his leg. Then he agreed to have his marriage annulled and never see his wife again in order to prevent a scandal that would cause her irreparable damage ... or so he thought. <br /> <br />After 15 years gone from Charleston, Nick is back to find out the truth about his mother. What he learns is more than he bargained for. <br /> <br />I have never read a mystery with more twists and turns, with more people you love to hate, with more questions answered that only lead to more questions. The characters are delightful, especially the spinster sisters who run the antique shop and provide continual clues.  <br /> <br />Fast-paced, rich with description of not only historical Charleston, but the power structure that makes Charleston what it is. I couldn't put the book down. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-05

Tiger, Jeff Stone's children's adventure story, is the first of a series about five young warrior monks in 17th century China. <br /> <br />The cover has a powerful illustration and raised lettering of the Chinese characters for tiger. It's a \\"wow\\" book from the cover to the too-quick ending. <br /> <br />Author Stone paints some amazingly clear pictures of these young monks and their kung fu fighting. I felt like I was in the midst of every fight, and in every perilous predicament. <br /> <br />Fu, also known as Tiger, is 12 years old, like his four monk brothers. They survive an attack on their secret temple by an evil 16-year-old monk. When Tiger and the other young monks realize that everyone has been massacred, they know they must hunt down and regain possession of the temple's scrolls. Why? The scrolls contained special kung fu fighting techniques only known to those monks. <br /> <br />Each monk takes on the persona of his corresponding animal, and future books in the series will be called Crane, Monkey, Dragon and Snake. Young readers will enjoy the energetic fight scenes, the young monk's cunning, and most of all, their commitment to each other and their grandmaster. <br /> <br />Children who are involved in the martial arts will immediately become fans and will love every moment in this page-turning book. I can't wait for the next one due in September 2005. <br /> <br />Warning from this reviewer: It's been eons since I've read to a child, or been involved in their video games, so I don't know what level of violence is acceptable. I was a bit taken aback by the graphic violence in the book. It is geared to 8-to-12-year olds but I think it should be 10-12. <br />	2005-05-05

Oh, no! Anna doesn't believe that weddings are fun for kids. She would rather ride her bike, climb trees or go swimming. <br /> <br />Anna decides to hide in the attic until after the wedding. While watching from her secret hiding place in the attic, Anna sees Aunt Julie, her mother and grandmother pull a gown and veil out of old boxes - and she begins to imagine how it would feel to be a bride. She wants to try on the beautiful things. Maybe Anna is changing her mind about weddings. No, she would still rather play outside than be a flower girl. <br /> <br />Flower Girl, by Kathy Furgang is a storybook for children 4-8 years of age. It is a nice story that youngsters will enjoy reading and Harley Jessup's delightful drawings will keep them turning the pages. <br />	2005-05-05

If you like to think, are curious about how cheaters cheat, and like characters you can care about, then Mr. Lucky is for you. James Swain brings us another Tony Valentine novel that finds the casino consultant stumped by Ricky Smith of Slippery Rock, North Carolina. Rick Smith survives a casino hotel fire by jumping from a fifth-floor balcony - and then wins at everything he plays. <br /> <br />Meanwhile Tony has his son Gerry take a trip for him to Mississippi. There Gerry finds himself involved with the Mississippi Mafia as he tries to interview a world-class Texas Hold 'Em player that Ricky beat out of $250,000 in 20 minutes while in Vegas. <br /> <br />And in between we find Mabel, Tony's assistant, trying to solve some scams on her own, doing it for bragging rights and a bonus. She also takes Gerry's wife, Yolanda to a town in Florida where two retired clowns show them that all is not what it seems - in the circus or in life. They also learn that carneys care, and once a friend, always a friend - which turns out to be a lifesaver! <br /> <br />There are characters to love, characters to hate, and characters to feel sorry for on both sides of the law. It's also a fascinating look at how casinos work - and how the casinos get taken. This well-written, fast-paced book is peppered with wonderful quirky characters. James Swain is fast becoming a must read for me. <br /> <br />	2005-05-05

Prudence's life is suffering from a lack of money, men and memories (she doesn't have a life), until she meets drag queen Digby Deeds (alias Mildren Crowley), author of the successful Savage Passion romance series, at a book signing. <br /> <br />Digby is dying, and with little forethought, leaves Prudence forty romance plots to write. Life soon imitates art as Prudence pens her first Indian romance. She becomes \\"involved\\" with Ray Chasing Hawk, a Native American activist, artist and model and discovers that real life is more complicated but better than any romance novel. <br /> <br />Pritchard deftly blends beautiful prose with hilarious situations. I laughed a lot and somehow, by the end of the book, didn't mind growing older so very much. I had a bit of trouble getting started and the situations sometimes seemed a bit over the top but I kept turning the pages and was happy thatI did. <br />	2005-05-05

The four women from her previous book, The Hot Flash Club, return to pamper four new stressed-out and weary women at their spa, The Haven. <br /> <br />This book introduces each woman and then rotates her story throughout the book. And in between we catch up on the original Hot Flash Club members. <br /> <br />Polly doesn't want to interfere in her son's marriage but does want to make peace with her cold, disapproving mother-in-law who always interfered in her marriage. Beth, a shy Ph.D. student, meets Sonny and fights to survive his mother Bobbie who really wants him to marry his beautiful, sexy former girlfriend, Robin. Paper company heiress Carolyn is suspicious about her father's young wife. Julia has married the man of her dreams but has to maneuver a mind field consisting of a manipulative daughter and a former mother-in-law who insinuates herself in their marriage. <br /> <br />The women must learn to take care of themselves and stand up for the things that are important to them. They learn, with the help of each other, that life is fuller, richer and easier when they take friends, wine and chocolate along for the ride. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed the book, there were just too many characters for me to grab hold of. Not only are there eight women but a host of children, in-laws, grandchildren, husbands and significant others. Whew! I became confused more than once. While I've read many of Nancy Thayer's novel, I hadn't read The Hot Flash Club- and that might have contributed to my confusion. If you can overcome the numerous characters and plot lines, you will find this book a wonderful heartwarming read. The storyline is solid and interesting. You'll love some of the characters and some will make you want to scream, and that alone keeps the pages turning. I wanted to know just what happened. <br />	2005-05-05

What followed is fascinating nonfiction that explores blood through history, literature, science and mythology.  <br /> <br />I must admit that when I first saw the book I wasn't particularly interested. I couldn't imagine the subject of blood to be anything but dull and even repulsive. Finally, curiosity got the best of me, and I picked it up and began reading. And I continued reading. <br /> <br />I couldn't believe how much there is to know about that vital fluid that runs through every human body. If you're interested in trivia, or find unique things that you've never considered fascinating before, this book is for you. I will never view my wedding ring or barbershop poles in the same way again.  <br /> <br />Five Quarts: A Personal and Natural History of Blood proves that even a seemingly obscure topic can be enthralling. <br />	2005-05-05

If you enjoy the mystery genre, possess a love for books and appreciate good writing - then you probably know John Dunning and his novels. If you aren't familiar with Dunning, allow me to introduce you to his work. I know one thing: if you pick up just one of Dunning's books, you'll be hooked and will be compelled to read the others. <br /> <br />Ex-cop and Denver bookseller Cliff Janeway spends his days buying and selling books. It's not a job for him; it's a calling. Add to the mix a relationship with Erin D'Angelo, a woman he adores and it makes for a grand life. But love can also complicate life, especially when the one you love asks you to investigate a friend (the term is used loosely since there have been problems between Erin and Laura) who is in jail, accused of murdering her husband, Bobby. <br /> <br />Cliff cannot deny Erin's request, especially when he learns that the murdered husband was a book collector. Following his arrival in Paradise to investigate the murder, Cliff learns that the case is far from simple, and things are not as they appear. Laura may not be telling the truth and Erin must decide whether she will legally represent her estranged friend while Cliff tries to determine the significance of the murder victim's book collection.  <br /> <br />Dunning has written another winner. A note: One of my favorite Dunning novels is not a Cliff Janeway mystery. Check out Two O'Clock, Eastern Wartime, as it is well-written and worthy of note. <br />	2005-05-04

Clay Sizemore's mother died a violent death when he was four years old. Clay is raised by his aunt Easter and surrounded by other aunts, uncles, cousins and friends who love him deeply. What Clay misses the most is a sense of belonging that he thinks can exist only with siblings, and a mother and a father. And that leaves him with an empty place within himself that he can't fill up. <br /> <br />As an adult, Clay becomes a coal miner, moves a few miles from Free Creek, in Appalachia, to find his way in life and to determine who he is as a man. But it is the people who love him that truly shape his life. Aunt Easter is his solid rock and the nurturer of his life and soul. His uncle Paul is a quilter who teaches Clay that the castoff bits and pieces of life can create beauty. And it is Paul who gives Clay a special gift from his mother. <br /> <br />But it is the fiddler Alma, who inches her way into Clay's heart and brings him back from despair. Together they face obstacles that threaten their happiness and their safety. Together they find answers to the questions that have haunted each of them. And new life helps Clay realize his life is good and the family he has always yearned for has been beside him all along.  <br /> <br />Sometimes a story grabs a hold of you and won't allow you to shake free. Silas House, author of Clay's Quilt has written just such a novel. It is a poignant story with touches of sadness and joy mixed together; much like real life. His prose invites the reader into the lives of his characters and allows us to live their experiences and feel their emotions. I didn't want the novel to end. I simply wanted more of Clay's story.  <br /> <br />House has written two other books since Clay's Quilt. They are The Coal Tattoo and A Parchment of Leaves.  <br />	2005-05-04

Imagine that you loved books and reading aloud more than just about anything in the world. Then imagine that you couldn't read aloud to your child, or anyone else, for fear that your melodious voice would bring the inhabitants of fiction to the real world - and in exchange something or someone from your world - would disappear into the fictional story. And what if the people that escaped from fiction to reality were evil, and a loved one was consumed into the fictional story?  <br /> <br />All that and so much more happens in Inkheart by Cornelia Funke. Meggie and her father Mo, a bookbinder, must learn to control the magic that conjured the nightmare of Capricorn, an evil ruler escaped from a storybook. In order to survive, Meggie and Moe must alter the course of the story that has forever changed their lives and left them constantly running from the evil that pursues them. <br /> <br />Inkheart is a grand adventure of good vs. evil. The twists and turns of the plot will compel you to keep turning the pages and will keep you guessing about what happens next. The wonderful complex characters are at times caricatures and that contributes to their appeal. And the settings will delight and frightened you. <br /> <br />Inkheart is also a story of a loving, caring relationship between a father and daughter team who attempt to overcome impossible odds. Although the book is extremely long (534 pages), I recommend Inkheart for both children and adults. <br />	2005-05-04

When the loon is not successful, other animals try.

I find I am curious about many things other people stick their nose up at. How many of you have the same guilty pleasures?  <br /> <br />The authors believe many of the items have two things in common: 1) Discussing them in public with either friends or strangers will automatically bring either 'condescending smiles or derisive giggles.' 2) All the things they talk about are or were extremely popular. <br /> <br />Arranged alphabetically, the book covers a rich and vast haul - everything from celebrities like Liberace and Bill Clinton; the scoop on Chef Boyardee (yes he was a real person), Hamburger Helper; and Rice-A-Roni; and an interesting fact about Old Spice Cologne and the sailor in the commercials. There are also tidbits about television programs like Sanford and Son, The Osbournes, Hee Haw and Gilligan's Island, to name a few. We also get interesting facts about The George Forman Grill, Kathie Lee Gifford, embarrassing Oscar acceptance speeches and television bloopers.  <br /> <br />This is a fun, light read full of 'stuff' that people are interested in, even if they don't want to admit it.	2005-05-01

She is beautiful and loved by her elderly mother and father. When Pear's mother dies, her father remarries a woman with a daughter the same age as Pear. Beautiful Pear's stepmother is jealous of her stepdaughter's beauty and requires her to perform many impossible chores, while her own daughter, Peony watches. <br /> <br />With the help of magical creatures (frog, sparrow, and black oxen) Pear successfully completes each chore and is able to attend the festival. On the way to the festival she loses her shoe. The magistrate sees the beautiful Pear and calls out to her. Believing he is yelling at her, she runs away without her shoe. At the festival the magistrate looks for the girl without the shoe. And we can guess the end of the story. <br /> <br />The Korean Cinderella is recognizable and is a captivating variation of the American version. The paintings are colorful and lush.

His emotions shine through. I kept thinking of Lawrence Ferlinghetti (my favorite poet), and although their poetry is different in so many ways -- because both men's thoughts are for their own particular time, their messages are both timeless. <br /> <br />If you like gritty, urban, thought-provoking poems, this volume is for you. <br />	2005-05-01

But Big Gray handles Little One's concerns with love, kindness and tact. He reassures his pup and points out what he does really well. <br /> <br />I am encouraged that there seem to be more children's books recently that have fathers who are involved and nurturing. Big Wolf is one of those nurturing parents. <br /> <br />The illustrations are nice and traditional.	2005-05-01

Kerry Madden, author of Gentle's Holler, has written a beautiful, humorous and poignant story of a mountain family who knows both poverty and love intimately.  <br /> <br />Livy Two Weems is 12-years old and has a desire that is burning a hole in her heart to see the world beyond the North Carolina hills. But she also knows how important family is in the scheme of life. And so what she wants and what she knows - is told in the songs she writes and plays on her guitar. <br /> <br />I am drawn to and fascinated by Livy Two Weems. Although a child, she is wise, ambitious, kind, loving, smart as a whip and talented. And she has a heart as big as the holler where she lives. It is through Livy's eyes that we see the Weems family and live their struggles. <br /> <br />Livy Two's mama is pregnant again, her harsh grandmother has come to visit after neglecting the family for five years, and her daddy is still hanging on to his dream of selling his banjo songs. There are nine children to feed (the tenth, Livy One, died the day she was born) and Livy Two knows that dreams of selling songs doesn't put food on the table.  <br /> <br />When a doctor tells the family that one of the children, Gentle, will always be blind, Livy Two decides there has to be a plan to help her. But other tragedies visit the Weems home, and Livy Two may not be able to be the strong girl her family needs. <br /> <br />There are sad and tragic events that take place in this book but love and hope never take a vacation. The characters are rich, real, complex and the kind you want to meet and ask to stay awhile. I loved all of them and didn't want them to leave. Madden's characters know they are poor, but also know that poverty is a situation and not about who they are. They are wonderful proud people who are doing their best. <br /> <br />In our society of conspicuous consumption, wanting it all, dissatisfaction with the small things, we and our children would do well to read this book and take its message to heart. I can only hope that Madden will give us more of Livy Two and her family. It would be sad to just let them go. Their message is far too important. <br />	2005-05-01

Beautiful Threads: Pieces of Encouragement for Quilters is 49 heartwarming stories filled with historical facts, spiritual insights and a passion for fabric and the end result; quilts. You don't have to be a quilter or even know one to enjoy this book and the message Tatem delivers. But if you happen to be a quilter, it will delight you. <br /> <br />Tatum starts each section of the book with a description of a quilt pattern, continues with the quilt stories and ends with a Bible verse and a small devotion-like paragraph. <br /> <br />It was a cold spring day when I began reading this book. I wrapped myself in the lovely quilt made for me by my mother-in-law, fixed some tea and lost myself in the stories of hope, faith and love. There is, I learned a similarity between quilting and mixing and matching the pieces, threads and fabrics of our lives. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book to keep by your bed (to be read or used as a devotional) or to give as a gift to a special person in your life.	2005-05-01

Dr. Nicholas Perricone's The Perricone Promise delves into the wrinkle-removing arena but also goes deeper. He tells us how we can look and feel 10 years younger in just 28 days. Who doesn't want to find the fountain of youth, or at least a reasonable facsimile? Perricone wants women and men to know that we can stay younger looking longer by following a program he designed to help reverse the aging process.  <br /> <br />Perricone maintains that if we want to decrease our susceptibility to age-related disease and slow the aging process we must control inflammation. And to do that he suggests we must control our diet and stress. Sounds logical. Remember the old adage 'we are what we eat'. He also maintains that his three-pronged approach of diet, supplements and topicals will turn back the hands of time. In addition he supports and encourages exercise for good health.  <br /> <br />I found the book interesting and logical but there was often more information given than I was really interested in knowing. The unfamiliar names like anthocyanins, antioxidants, and exitotoxicity, were difficult for a lay person and interfered with my reading. I enjoyed the book more when I felt Dr. Perricone got to the 'nuts and bolts' of the process.  <br /> <br />I think that this program is great for people who have a personal chef who not only does the family cooking but the shopping as well. Or if you are someone who doesn't have anything better to do than shop and cook. Then, it's probably perfect.  <br /> <br />I love the idea of this program, I just don't know how to stop my life long enough to live it.	2005-05-01

Gooney Bird is comical; her teacher is every child's dream teacher. And the room mother, well you'll have to read the book to learn about the room mother.	2005-05-01

A Garden in Paris by Stephanie Grace Whitson is a poignant novel of acceptance and reconciliation. <br /> <br />After a lifetime of living for others, Mary Davis finds a framed motto at an antique market. It says, \\"It is never too late to be what you might have been.\\" Mary decides that she must at least attempt to be what she might have been and free herself of the past that haunts her. <br /> <br />It is two years after her husband's death and the motto's simple statement offers her hope for the future. It also prompts her to write a letter that sets into motion a collision course with her past and present life. <br /> <br />Mary leaves for Paris following a disagreement with her only daughter, Elizabeth, who had always been \\"Daddy's girl.\\" Through the family housekeeper, Elizabeth learns part of her mother's history - a history that her father would never allow her mother to live - and demanded that it be kept secret. Elizabeth learned that her beloved father cut her mother off from the very life she was born to live. And out of love and obligation, Mary did so. <br /> <br />It a rare act of spontaneity, Liz follows her mother to Paris where she attempts to reconcile with her mother, and there meets her own history face-to face, one she never imagined. <br /> <br />A Garden in Paris is a well-written novel that will keep you turning the pages and wanting more. It is, so far, my favorite 2005 Christian novel. The manner in which Whitson manages to incorporate faith into the story is ingenuous. I was thrilled to learn that there is a sequel to A Garden in Paris.	2005-04-25

And in embracing this faith adventure, Meeuwsen says we can live God's purpose for each of us. <br /> <br />Meeuwsen shares her personal story, her unique struggles and successes, her God adventure, in this practical, thought-provoking book. <br /> <br />When God wants something done, He looks for men and women to take the assignment; much like the old television program, Mission Impossible. \\"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is ....\\" We are offered the opportunities; we just need to decide if we're going to accept His assignment. If we don't, someone will. But we'll never know what we've missed! It is an act of faith and not without risk-taking to follow God. But Meeuwsen believes that when we put our own plans on hold, wonderful surprises will occur. She calls it a God adventure. <br /> <br />This was a timely book for me as I've been on my own \\"wilderness journey.\\" I was able to look back on my own life and clearly see where I stepped out in faith and where I hesitated. After reviewing those experiences, it is clear to me that taking the risks, believing that God knows what is best for me and will do His best by me, has been, by far, the best part of my journey. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I can name and claim my experiences as my very own God adventure. <br />	2005-04-23

In A Rogue in a Kilt, Blair has written an inviting, exciting, intriguing and tender love story.  It is the story of Sir Angus McDougall and Birdalane. <br /> <br />A hasty bet has Angus McDougall scouring the countryside to find a bride.  He must do so within three months in order to claim the prize of a castle.  Should he fail in his quest, he will lose six months' salary and be humiliated as well.  Of course this strong and bold man has no fear of failure.  Yet, after two months of searching, Angus is no closer to finding a bride than when he began.  He decides it might be time to step up his search and broaden his criteria. <br /> <br />Birdalane lives alone in the woodland.  She has a mystical gift that allows her to heal others, but not without cost to her.  A chance meeting with Angus and a careless phrase binds them to each other for a year and a day.  Birdalane bravely leaves the only home she has known to follow Angus throughout Scotland.  Their travels are filled with danger -- there are gifts that are received and selflessly given, joy and grief -- all before they reach their destination and accept the truth of their hearts. <br /> <br />I wiped a tear or two, laughed more than a little and felt warm and satisfied when the story ended. <br />	2005-04-14

Accompanying each photograph is the owner's story.  The photographs are stunning and show not only each woman's taste in hats, but also their owner's beauty and personality.

In A Table by the Window, author Lawana Blackwell takes on some difficult subjects and when you first look at the list, it seems a bit daunting.  But Blackwell tackles the subjects with sensitivity, and at the same time manages to tell a story that will warm your heart.  And when you've finished the book you'll yearn for more of Tallulah, Mississippi and its inhabitants.  Even though Tallulah has problems, the residents are connected to each other and honestly care about each other.  <br /> <br />Carley Reed's childhood was filled with abuse and neglect, yet she managed to become a schoolteacher and keep a pretty positive attitude.  Her quiet life in San Francisco is turned upside down when a private investigator informs her that she's inherited her grandmother's estate in Tallulah, Mississippi. <br /> <br />Carley is charmed by the town, the people and the family she never knew. She decides to stay, creates a new career for herself, helps a young girl who reminds her of herself at age 17 and even finds some romantic interests.  But a murder threatens her happiness and may even threaten her life. <br /> <br />The faith aspect of A Table by the Window is subtle; however, Blackwell neatly manages to convey faith through the character's honesty, integrity and strong sense of morality as well as faith-based statements. <br /> <br />I found myself wanting to trade in my busy life for the small-town serenity of Tallulah because it's a place where people know your name and care about you and your history. <br />	2005-04-14

It proves that when commitment, honor and love are involved, great differences can be overcome. <br /> <br />The black and white illustrations are amazing.

Donaldson because of the popular Thomas Covenant series. Some fans may not know that Donaldson also wrote a series of mystery novels. <br /> <br />The Man Who Tried to Get Away is an Axbrewder/Fistoulari mystery.  It is a well-written, well-plotted novel.  But beware!  It is a dark book with dark, dysfunctional characters. As good as it is, I felt sad and a bit depressed while I read it. <br /> <br />Mick \\"Brew\\" Axbrewder is an alcoholic private investigator who has been spiraling downward for some time. Actually he's been on his downward spiral since shooting a cop who happened to be his brother - and since his partner Ginny Fistoulari blew off her own hand protecting him. The relationship between Brew and Ginny is twisted and as dysfunctional as the other members of the murder mystery camp. <br /> <br />The Man Who Tried to Get Away opens following an incident in which Brew was shot. Barely back on his feet he is joining Ginny in providing security for a murder mystery camp. The players are staying at an isolated, snowbound lodge for a week and during that week, they are to solve a murder mystery. <br /> <br />Before the mystery camp begins, someone kills or attempts to kill the players. Brew, recuperating from his gunshot wound, wants to help Ginny, the mystery campers and himself stay alive and find the murderer. He just doesn't have the confidence that he can, without a drink. <br /> <br />The Man Who Tied to Get Away is a good, well-written novel, but be prepared to visit the darkest sides of humanity.

Don't get me wrong, serious hard-boiled mystery novels keep me turning the pages as my heart rate rises.  At times, however, I want a break from the grisly and macabre.  Then I just want a bit of a laugh at the dark side while getting my mystery fix.  <br /> <br />James Swain novels fit the bill.  And like any good mystery fan, I began at the beginning with Grift Sense.  Ex-cop Tony Valentine is a no-nonsense widower with an extremely troublesome adult son. Valentine left the East Coast and settled in Florida next door to an aging woman with a unique sense of humor that she practices on the community via the newspaper. But an entertaining neighbor isn't enough to keep Valentine busy. Boredom won and purely by accident he started a post retirement business. <br /> <br />Valentine has a particular talent. He can identify casino hustlers better than just about anyone, even the guys in Las Vegas. And Las Vegas needs him now.  Valentine is called to a second-rate, casino to help figure out how a player is consistently beating the house. Add to the mix a beautiful young woman who is accused of helping the hustler and then throw in other characters that could have stepped out of an old gangster movie and you have the makings of a fun and interesting 'who done it and how did they do it?' <br /> <br />Swain's characters are exaggerated and sometimes over the top, but all is tempered by Valentine's dry wit and interesting view of the world. I smiled often and kept turning the pages. I wanted to know, just how did they do that?  <br /> <br />	2005-04-14

But no one makes me laugh out loud like Jennifer Crusie.  She has a down right unusual way of looking at life and love.  I enjoy the way she always carries her readers along with her for a tumultuous ride through love in modern-day America.  And Welcome to Temptation is no exception. <br /> <br />Sophie Dempsey leads a nice quiet life filming wedding videos until she's hired to produce a documentary about Clea, an aging film star's return to her home town of Temptation, Ohio.  With Amy, her slightly twisted sister in tow, trouble finds them before they even enter Temptation's city limits.  Sophie somehow knew it would, and in short order Temptation proved all her suspicions about small towns and the folks who live in them. <br /> <br />With a delightful, if not crazy cast of characters, Temptation spirals out of control when hunky mayor Phin Tucker and the police chief, Wes Mazur, object to filming in the town. The men do not, however, object to Sophie and Amy and will not turn down any opportunities to get to know the women better. <br /> <br />As the documentary quickly turns into a potential porn film, Clea's husband Zane has some permanent health issues, the race for mayor of Temptation becomes dicey, and though Sophie tries, she can't seem to completely ignore Phin or his obvious charms. <br /> <br />Welcome to Temptation is an entertaining read that will bring you to laughter. Warning: The sex is explicit, but if it's not your cup of tea, you can breeze over it. It'll give you more time to laugh at the wonderful wit that is Jennifer Crusie's trademark.  <br />	2005-04-14

Her novel, Right as Rain has an intensity that takes your breath away and a softness that fills you with a quiet peacefulness. <br /> <br />Right as Rain spans two decades in Mississippi and entices us to scrutinize our history of race relations; or lack thereof. What is shown will repel you and draw you in at the same time. The rich fabric of the story of Icey and Tee Wee, their families, and the family that employs them is fraught with racial strife, unrealized dreams and secrets that grow larger with time. But it is the love and friendship that evolves between Icey and Tee Wee that touches our hearts and keeps us turning the pages. <br /> <br />If you enjoy realistic fiction but need to know that there is love, kindness and joy in the world, regardless of circumstances, or that strength of character can survive the obstacles life throws at people, then this book is for you. An added bonus is that Marshall's prose grabs the reader and takes them for a ride they'll tell their friends about.	2005-04-14

And I also enjoy discovering new authors. The upside of finding new talent is the joy of reading what they've written. The downside is that I have to wait and pray that there will be more books to follow. Elizabeth Bloom, author of See Isabelle Run is just such an author. <br /> <br />Isabelle Leonard was left at the altar moments before her wedding. But that didn't prevent her from going dateless to her reception, dancing on a table and ending up a New York news story. Then reality, like a brick wall, smacks her in the pocketbook. Without a husband and a job, she can't afford the apartment she's living in and doesn't know where her next meal is coming from. <br /> <br />Isabelle takes a job at Becky Belden Multimedia where the corporate culture is perky and creepy at the same time.  Becky Belden, the creator and head of BBM is a Martha Stewart-like clone. Soon after joining the BBM family, Isabelle discovers that employees are dropping dead like flies. See Isabelle run as she becomes the next target for the killer. <br /> <br />This is a witty, well-written.  If you want a fast, fun read, See Isabelle Run might just be what you're looking for. <br /> <br />	2005-04-14

Absolute Power kept me up late several nights, Total Control happily helped me through an illness, The Winner was a page turner and well, I could go on and on. During Christmas 2003 I enjoyed a different type of Baldacci Book, The Christmas Train. What a wonderful journey he took his readers on with this lovely Christmas story with a message and a twist.  <br /> <br />Baldacci's current release is Hour Game, a serial murder but, really so much more. It is also a puzzle. It could be said that Baldacci's serial killer is not a serial killer or that the clock hands on the watches left on the bodies are not necessarily clock hands, or that no one is who they seem to be. <br />  <br />After a woman is found murdered with a unique watch on her wrist, a manhunt is on, but not before the body count begins rising at breakneck speed and the small town of Wrightsburg, Virginia spirals into a nightmare of mammoth proportions.  <br /> <br />Former Secret Service agents turned private investigators Sean King and Michelle Maxwell have been hired to prove Junior Deaver did not burglarize the home of a wealthy and extremely dysfunctional local family. This is easier said than done and the journey in proving Junior Deaver's innocence eventually crosses paths with the serial killer. To solve the burglary, King and Maxwell must also find the person or persons who are filling the morgue with dead bodies. The case eventually jeopardizes the lives of King and Maxwell and leaves them with answers to questions that they don't necessarily want to know.  <br /> <br />At the time of this writing, Hour Game is in hardcover. I began reading it prior to leaving for Hawaii. As someone who travels only with soft cover books, I can tell you that Hour Game was well worth the extra weight and bulk.  <br /> <br />Hour Game is fast-paced and easy-to-read, yet it keeps you wanting to solve the puzzle. At its conclusion it left me wanting another David Baldacci book. Alas, I've read everything he has had published and like you, I'll have to wait for the next one. David, are you listening? More wonderful reads, please! Faster, Faster!  <br /> <br />	2005-04-13

That He knows what is best for us and that it is so much more than we ever imagined it could be.  <br /> <br />In Always Jan, Roxanne Henke welcomes us to Brewster, North Dakota, the kind of town where most people would love to live and raise a family. It's a place where people know your name and reach out to help each other. It's where folks gather at the restaurant or gas station to gossip and commiserate with each other. It's a place, like most others, only smaller, where the inhabitants have hopes and dreams, love their friends, family and neighbors and share the sadness of broken dreams and deep hurts. It's also a place where God lives.  <br /> <br />Jan believes she is \\"getting old\\" and losing her beauty. Kenny owns the local gas station but there isn't enough money for his growing family. Ida, Kenny's aunt, values independence, health and a vital future. Each character experiences a \\"challenge\\" that they didn't expect and didn't want.  Henke weaves each character's life dilemma through the lives of the others in a seamless manner. Jan, Kenny and Ida are each broken, in their own way, and each must learn through their personal trials that God's plan is the best plan. <br /> <br />There was a time when I didn't enjoy Christian fiction because it wasn't real life. It seemed that life in Christian fiction was always \\"happy ever after,\\" if only we believed. Real life isn't always perfect, even when we trust and believe. <br /> <br />Roxanne Henke's novel Always Jan approaches life in a \\"real\\" way: real people, with real problems, who struggle to live their faith. I smiled, I squeezed the tears threatening to break free and I kept reading. I didn't want the story to end because I felt I knew these people and I liked them, \\"warts\\" and all. I can't wait to read her other novels. If you haven't read Roxanne Henke's novels, please do so and \\"Welcome to Brewster...it's a good place to call home.\\" <br /> <br />	2005-04-13
